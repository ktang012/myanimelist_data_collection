            "content": "It is a common belief in fiction that the bigger and more explosive a story is, the better it becomes. \r\nIn the case of \"Suisei no Gargantia\", bigger is anything but better. What makes the first half of the anime so special, and so rewarding, is made irrelevant by the bloated mess that follows. And it's a shame- it had the potential to be one of the best anime of these past few years.\r\nDespite being the latest work of the (in)famous Urobuchi Gen, Suisei no Gargantia depicts a much more down-to-earth story. There is no ruthless slaughtering of the characters (though some might deserve itat times), nor are there any plot twists until the last few episodes. Suisei no Gargantia is set in a distant future where the Earth has been flooded. And flooded entirely. What remains of human civilization live their days in fleets of antiquated ships, free from any worry but the rare threat of pirates. \\n\\n\r\nEnter \"Ledo\", a teenage soldier from across the galaxy who somehow, conveniently enters a wormhole that drops him to the birthplace of humanity-- Earth. \\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting aspect of the series is how Ledo copes with (and eventually accepts) a society so distinctly different from his own. Where Ledo comes from, concepts such as peace do not exist. Humans are born and raised for the sole purpose of fighting their enemy, the Hideaze. And naturally there is no such thing as love or friendship.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat follows is a series of amusing, sometimes uncomfortable scenes of Ledo experiencing culture shock. What the heck is the purpose of money? ... to buy more weapons to shoot dudes with? He has no idea. Whenever he experiences something new, he and his AI companion (\"Chambers\") will inevitably draw some ridiculous contrast to their own society. In one scene, Ledo even asks the person beside him why an injured child is alive. I felt very bad for laughing at that. \\n\\n\r\nLedo also experiences a rapid period of growth as he becomes closer with the inhabitants of the Gargantia fleet. He learns to enjoy life, how to do ordinary things such as swimming or cooking, and what friendship means. He transforms from a cold, ruthless soldier into a normal human being, one that can feel emotion and remorse. The Ledo at the start of the story is not the Ledo at the end of the story, and this character development is something that deserves no shortage of praise. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, there's also everything else about the story.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed the relaxed and carefree nature of the first half, prepare to have everything you liked about the show flipped upside down in the second half. The character development slows to a crawl. The comedy becomes nonexistent. What is hammered in its place is a joyless disaster, devoid of anything even remotely interesting. \\n\\n\r\nWhere to begin? I suppose the moronic characterization would be a start. While the first half showed signs of the side characters breaking away from their stereotype, the second half seeks instead to bury them in that shell. The only character aside from Ledo who even receives any notable growth is Pinion, but his backstory is so contrived and heavy-handed that there's little reason to care about his suffering. \\n\\n\r\nEven worse are the minor characters who populate the Gargantia fleet. They are insufferably stupid. There is one scene where Ledo is reprimanded by the fleet's commanders for protecting them from a pirate attack, which would have inevitably led to looting and violence. Are you kidding me? \\n\\n\r\nIt makes one wonder why this screen time wasn't handed to Amy instead. Aside from Ledo, she is the only character in the show with sense in her brain. She is the one who changed Ledo, who taught him that life is worth living, and yet she is merely relegated to the role of a cheer leader by the end. She deserved much more than that. \\n\\n\r\nSure, Ledo is plenty developed, but he is just as much a victim as anybody else. The change that the first half had building for him is simply used as a tool to force in cheesy dialogue about the power of friendship. During the climax, he changes his mind over an important decision simply because Amy came flying by on a kite to yell at him. Can I puke now? \\n\\n\r\nThis would be bad enough on its own, but the plot itself fares no better. Plot twists and ridiculous contrivances are the name of the game. Everything is somehow tied to Ledo and his own people, and the 'twists' (especially regarding the antagonist) are so cliched that they almost feel as if the writer was playing a joke. And then there's not even a proper ending to wrap all of this mess up! It ends abruptly with little to no context, begging you to follow through with the sequel OVA for answers. There is absolutely no reason why the audience should have to watch a sequel in order to have a proper conclusion to a story that they already invested their time in. That is silly. \\n\\n\r\nOn a more positive note, the artwork is generally decent. The characters are modeled consistently while the oceans are rendered with grandeur, effectively making the post-apocalyptic Earth seem more like a paradise. However, the quality plummets in the 11th episode, where entire scenes have crowds of characters drawn as blobs. Literal blobs. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also one of the better points of the anime. There's nothing here that will stay in your mind for eternity (though the ending song is sure as heck relaxing), but each of the lighthearted tracks do a solid job of conveying the feelings of relaxation and hope which pervade the first half. It's an atmospheric anime when it tries to be, which makes the second half all the more lamentable. \\n\\n\r\nSuisei no Gargantia is an anime with an identity crisis. Is it a dramatic story about the dark secrets of humanity, or is it simply a lighthearted tale about a young man finding his place in life? Who really knows. I don't think it does either.\\n\\n\r\nIt didn't have to turn out this way.",

            "content": "A utopia. \r\nHow many people have ever dreamed about our world ever becoming one? It's an idea that stretches beyond dreams and imaginations. In such a world, there would be peace, paradise, and colonies where humanity can settle down and enjoy their lives. Well, those are just all dreams of course. People may fill their heads with these ideas but for the Human Galactic Alliance, it's one that they hope to fulfill for many years. Then, there's one young boy among all of this and his name is Ledo. After a certain event, he gets swallowed up into a distortion of time and space whilefinding himself on a new place. It's Earth, a planet of life and prosperity.\\n\\n\r\nSuisei no Gargantina (also known as Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet) is an original animated series that fuses the genres of action, drama, science fiction, and mecha into a single package. The famous Gen Urobuchi is involved in the series as both for the script and composition. Based on his various style of  writing in his previous works (Psycho Pass, Madoka), this series takes a different direction. It takes the form of a more style of world building constructed by our characters, settings, and themes that sets off this science fiction series.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the series takes place in the distant future. Thus, its technologies and settings are far beyond our modern times by standards. A clear example is our main male protagonist Ledo and his sidekick Chamber. He is a AI-automated, humanoid-shaped battle suit with a catchy tone of voice to go along with it. More importantly though, he is Ledo's partner as well as a weapon of war. Chamber fits within the style of science fiction by the way of his stature and its mechanization. With powerful technology, we can see that Chamber is something out of the ordinary. Then of course, there's Ledo. He is a 16 year old young male who is recognized as a Galactic Alliance lieutenant. After engaging battles against the mysterious tentacled alien beings known as the \u201cHideauze\u201d, he gets stranded to another planet. It's a verdurous planet where the Gargantians live and prosper. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, there's all kind of new excitement waiting for our friend Ledo.\\n\\n\r\nThat brings forth the Gargantinans who have peacefully settled on the planet. As we can see, the planet itself is covered with water. Thus, people are forced to live on enormous ships in order to survive. Through unity and cooperation, colonies have been established and attempts are made to settle down peacefully. Unfortunately, that's not always the case. Beyond just the mysterious Hideauze species, there are also pirates. In fact, one of the earlier episodes shows a pirate fleet directly engaging in combat against the Gargantinans. These people seems to be a bit different than normal humans. Although on the outside, they look almost just like normal humans, they have different standards. Through comparisons, the Gargantinans functions differently by the way they don't murder senselessly. They also seem to enjoy life to their fullest and often tries to endlessly protect it no matter what the cause. Going back though, it's clear that these beings value lives truly. For example, they treat the handicapped with respect and also protect creatures whom are considered \u201csacred\u201d under their eyes. However at the same time, there seems to exist some problems between them and other colonies. These problems on such a utopia gives a different outlook on the world that is considered Earth with such a paradise.\\n\\n\r\nBeing the new guy on a whole new planet, Ledo is the talk among the crew members. Among these members include Amy, a girl who literally becomes Ledo's hostage from the beginning. She is a young girl with about the same age as Ledo. At first, they get off to a rocky start because of the circumstances. However, it is clear that Amy cares about Ledo as she is perhaps the only person who gets closest to him. Through interactions, Amy serves as both a guide and friend to Ledo. Even from the beginning, she is fearless towards him and offers assistance in learning about the world. (with a taste of a bitty treat if I might add) Over time, it's also clear that Amy wants Ledo to adjust to his new environment. In many ways, Amy serves as someone who can navigate Ledo's character through her guidance. By teaching him the standards of a human and adjusting them, Ledo seems to become softer and more humane as before. This is most prominent as Ledo is taught about the philosophy of \u201cthink before killing\u201d. The philosophy seems to confuse Ledo at first because the way he grew up assumingly. At many variances, Ledo questions about the laws of human nature and what's right or wrong. However, there is an unique bond between the two that I find to be natural and interactive. It is through interactions with Amy that Ledo now has a more value to where he belongs. It seems that there's a case of Ledo desiring to protect Amy and his newfound home. His morality is built based on the moments they share and although they seem to be simple, it is important for his character from my perspective.\\n\\n\r\nAmong other characters as well is Chamber, the ever so flashy robot who serves as a tool and sidekick (not to mention translator) for Ledo. His origins are a bit mysterious by his manner of speech but even more so with his structure. The machine seems to also serve as a guide for Ledo on the planet and at the same time, a weapon of war. It is equipped with a devastating offensive weapon (a disintegrator ray of sorts) as well as agility to maneuver itself against adversaries. Other characters in the series such as Bellows, Pinion, and Amy's friends also make their flashy highlights whether it's to serve as progressing Ledo's character or just giving him some time of fun.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of fun, the series does push that mood a bit especially later on. It comes in all shapes and sizes too with some fan service swimwear. To further this element, Ledo himself becomes Mr. Fan service and the girls just seems to love him for that. It doesn't stop there either as it pushes the dance scenes along with the mood coupled with the panty shots and up-skirts. At the same time, it pokes fun of the language in the series that can be portrayed as both scientific and at times, comedy. To further this out a bit, the series also has that lighthearted mood with its slow pacing.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this though, the series still retains its serious mood at many times. Ledo's progressing in character seems more evident the more time he spent with others, in particular Amy. In fact, he even learns how to express gratitude to others in the form of a simple \u201cThank You\u201d. He also learns about some of the food and how they came to be on the planet. Unfortunately, Ledo does not seem to forget about his primary objective and this earns him some criticism from others. If you guessed something related to 'killing', then you're right. Ledo's personal philosophy still seems to stick hard in his head. Only this time, he seems to have something worth fighting for. However, the guy isn't exactly a pacifist. \\n\\n\r\nAmong other factors, I find this series also a little bit mysterious. This is especially evident in the beginning involving the Hideauze as they are described by Ledo as his ultimate antagonist and executioners of the world. Then, there's the planet Earth itself as well as the Gargantinans. How did they survive all these years? What happened to the planet that caused all the flooding? Why are certain creatures on the planet so sacred? These are perhaps many questions that pops up into a viewers mind as they are watching this series. Needless to say, it makes this show worth watching for its assumed origins and how fans perceive them as each episode progresses.\\n\\n\r\nThe action of this series is spectacular but at times seems a bit out of space. The way that Ledo engages in combat from the beginning is presented visually as exciting. At the same time, we can also see that Ledo is a bit too good at what he does especially against some pirates later on. Watching a somewhat overpowered MC loses somewhat of a balance. Furthermore, his actions results in anger from the people of the planet. He just doesn't understand the laws of human nature. For Ledo, humanity is something that may take him a very long time to understand. \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals in this series is outstanding. It is beautiful enough that the series must be watched in 720P or higher or it might lose the experience of this show. The reason lies in the magnificent battle in the beginning. Then, it's the planet that Ledo landed on. The planet's ocean is given strong scenery to give an impression of a world of water. The characters' designs also gives a feeling of an utopia. Though some of them may be dressed with more fan service material than others, it sets the mood right with its theme. It shows that the series has that feeling of science fiction. Ledo himself also seems to stand out with the way he dresses and those noticeable hair and eyes. Among other things, the architectures and vessels on the planet are designed to be aquatic along with the creatures themselves. Needless to say, this series is a visually presented with extraordinaire. With the talented Hirotsugu Kakoi (Mirai Nikki, Blue Exorcist) in charge, I find this series to be quite something in terms of visual artwork. That something is obviously worth the praise.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the soundtrack of this show seems to strike me also as powerful.Taro Iwashiro is in charge of the background OST and I find it to fitting. It balances between smooth to intense at occasions but nothing too earth shattering. It does match with some scenes though. At the same time, there are two pieces of songs performed by Minori Chihara (the Opening song) and ChouCho (the Ending song). They have their style but the visuals seems to overshadow the soundtrack here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series was a very pleasant experience for me. Although it takes a different approach of how Gen Urobuchi's other works, it's an unique approach to the science fiction genre. At some instances, it might seem like a slice of life story. However, the experiences the characters goes through is much more than that. It challenges them the aspect of life, especially for Ledo in terms of his standards and morality. As a soldier of an alliance, his certain circumstances becomes something completely different than what he was used to. It's insightful to watch how he adjusts to them. Through world building along with the cultural differences, the viewers can see how Ledo explores his new found situation on the planet. Perhaps it does flow a bit slow than what some fans may expect out of a science fiction show. However, that flow from my perpective is one that is a fun ride to experience. Yup, I got a nice experience watching Suisei no Gargantia. \\n\\n\r\nNow, it's your turn.",

            "content": "After seeing episode nine of this series I feel compelled to write a review about it.\r\nSuisei no Gargantia is by far the best anime of the season, even better than Shingeki no Kyojin and I am really hoping that they renew it for a second season (because I feel they will need more episodes to develop the plot. \r\nEssentially if you have followed the series so far you know that Ledo (the main character) is a solider in the Galactic Alliance which has been in a non stop war with the Hideauze for as long as anyone can remember. Ledo like his solider counterparts werebred to be soldiers, go through massive amounts of psychological altering, and ultimately are trained to hate the Hideauze with all of their being as a human. This is evidenced by Chambers continual Sleep preservation training, and his instinctual will to kill the Hideauze on sight. \\n\\n\r\nWhen you watch this series you follow essentially the humanization of ledo as a character, from a human Hideauze killing machine to a being that thinks on his own, and it so far has been wonderful. \\n\\n\r\nNow to break this down into parts.\\n\\n\r\nStory & Characters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen Ledo and Chamber first arrive on earth after the result of being lost in a wormhole, they are essentially helpless. Clueless to where they are after being in a state of cryo-stasis for 6 months, they awake to humans trying to pry Chamber open. This is where you get to meet the rest of the major characters in the series and Ledo begins living life in his own way. As the episodes progress you get to meet Amy, Ridget, Pinion, Bellows and the rest of the cast, and you see how they affect Ledo's almost machine like mentality and slowly turn him into a human being. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis by far has top quality animation and sound like Shingeki no Kyojin, except with a much more vivid color palette. As many other reviewers have noted, though Shingeki may be the most original story based anime to watch this season, Suisei is the one you choose to watch for the animation. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment Factor 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI've been trying real hard to not give away too many spoilers about the anime or write a word for word plot synopsis, but this anime has it all. The story so far is killer, the animation is great, and you can just tell it was a well thought out anime. To me, it feels like an original story for an anime. I won't say that at this point I haven't seen the story in a video game, because I honestly have, but for an anime it is quite original. \\n\\n\r\nSo go on, watch it. I don't think you will be disappointed.",

            "content": "Suisei no Gargantia (or Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet) is a show that starts off with plenty of promise. It had famed writer Gen Urobuchi venturing outside the grimness of his previous work to make a more uplifting story, beautiful visuals from Production I.G., and a great premise. It explored thought-provoking concepts while remaining fun and affirming; possessing an optimism and faith in humanity that was simply infectious. However, while the first half of the show flows with a comfortably and naturally (albeit with some wasted time), the second half is clunky and forceful in introducing darker elements to the plot. The end is stilla decent and interesting show, but it doesn't quite live up to expectation.\\n\\n\r\nThe set-up for the show is great. Due to some great catastrophe, most humans have left Earth and are now engaged in a constant battle for survival against bizarre monstrosities called Hideauze, becoming a militaristic society called the Galactic Alliance of Humankind. Our hero Ledo is a young man who was born into this endless war, knowing nothing but battle. Due to an accident he is transported far away from this conflict, to a water covered planet; the Earth which humankind had left so long ago. He comes across the (mostly) peaceful boat-dwelling indigenous people living in a fleet named Gargantia, and has to adapt to their drastically different culture in order to survive in this unfamiliar world. This set-up works for so many reasons. It allows the show's world to open up as Ledo learns more about his new surroundings; its culture and its people. It provides contrast between Ledo's militaristic way of life and the more laid-back way of life on Gargantia. Most importantly, it gives Ledo a lot of potential for development as he grows accustom to the ways of Gargania, and makes personal connections with its people.\\n\\n\r\nLedo is by far the most developed character in the show, as it should be because the story hinges on his growth. He starts off as hard-edged, serious young man lacking in personality and understanding of the nuances of human interaction; which is no fault of his own, of course. Despite not understanding of the world he landed in, he knows that he must adapt to his surroundings, which of course includes adjusting to Gargatnia's society and finding his place in it. Completely foreign to him are many of Gargantia's core values: co-existence, caring for the deficient, and using violence as a last resort. The lax organization of the fleet and laid-back way of life seem inefficient to him. However, as he continues to meet and interact with the residents of Gargantia, he begins to understand and appreciate their way of life. This leads to an inner conflict between the ideas that have been instilled in him at a young age, and these new feelings he is developing; which comes to a head when he finds creatures living beneath the water that are genetically identical to the Hideauze. Ledo's development throughout the show is the driving factor on the show, and seeing him change and loosen up is the greatest satisfaction of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast don't have anywhere near the amount of development Ledo has; really do feel secondary. The exception is Ledo's battle mech and support unit, Chamber. Despite not being human, Chamber has a surprising amount of charm; his (Chamber has a male voice) duty to serve and protect Ledo actually grants him some personality. Though his A.I. gives him great analytical ability, being a robot Chamber doesn't really understand human interaction, which is often used for some good laughs. Amy is the spunky girl who volunteers to be Ledo's guide in Gargantia; she's the catalyst to much of Ledo's changes, and his love interest later in the show. She doesn't develop much beyond her feelings for Ledo, but she is a ray of sunshine and a good foil for our stoic lead. Her disabled younger brother Bevel also has a profound, if limited, effect on the show. Through his conversations with Bevel, Ledo learns the value that every person, even someone who is disabled, brings. Most of the other characters are less remarkable; they do get some development, but not enough to make them really memorable. Which is a shame because the show could have done something interesting with many of these characters, but ultimately focuses on them only enough for them to be plot devices. Some of the their actions later in the story feel like they happened for plot convenience, rather than something the characters would do.\\n\\n\r\nThe world of Gargaintia is rich in detail and well developed through the early stages of the show. The show begins with a detailed introduction to the Galactic Alliance of Humankind, a bit of its history and social structure, and it isn't even where the main story takes place. When Ledo lands on Earth, it opens up a new world to explore. The show does a good job of depicting first contact between two unfamiliar cultures. Along with the difference of environment and culture, Ledo doesn't even speak the same language as the people of Gargantia. It takes him some time to learn their language; he has to rely on Chamber to decipher and translate for him regularly at first. This really adds to the show's immersion; as a viewer, it feels like you are discovering a new world alongside Ledo. Details of Gargaintia's society and Earth's ecosystem are introduced gradually through situations, rather than just being explained in information dumps. Not to say it always uses its time effectively, episode 5 is a completely unnecessary  fan-service episode that is also the low point in the show's writing, and there are moments which are a bit too quaint every once in a while. Still, all in all, it is a very good approach, building the settings in a very natural way.\\n\\n\r\nThe show loses this quality in the darker later half, which delves into why and how humans left Earth to begin with. After certain events cause tension, Ledo parts ways with Gargantia for a while. This leads to him finding footage chronicling the events before a large populous fled to space. It is interesting, showing that the people of Earth were far from united even in the face of impending disaster, with two factions waging war on each other. However, it is also a huge info dump that feels out of place. It goes on about disagreements of what actions should be taken for mankind's survival, and arguments of ethics concerning genetic modification; as well as the origins of the Galactic Alliance, and the creation of the Hideauze. It is too much information at one time, and is quite jarring, honestly. The pacing also is jarringly different, with majority of the big plot twists taking place in the latter half; the show goes from pacing itself leisurely to being very busy. Because of this, a lot of characters' development is rushed, and there isn't really any closure or catharsis for any characters the show takes time to develop, with the exception of Ledo and Chamber.\\n\\n\r\nNot to say these plot twists are bad. They invoke some interesting ideas about the system a group of people live under and how it can become harmful when it is so rigid that it becomes constrictive; as it has in the Galactic Alliance of Humanity and the cult that is introduced late in the series. Human society needs a system to function, but when that system becomes all encompassing that it determines how everyone living under it thinks, it becomes an oppressive force. This is a theme Urobuchi seems endlessly fascinated with, having explored similar ideas in his past work. The thing is, Gargantia somewhat oversimplifies these ideas by doing too much to vilify the system at work without really going into why such a system might be necessary. The cult introduced near the finale is so brainwashed that it is obvious that the show is skewed against their way of live. It's admirable that the show believes so strongly in a simpler and more loosely constructed way of life, but it is optimistic to the point of naivety in its view. Luckily, Ledo's revaluation of his life gives the show's values enough weight to still be honest and meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the visuals go, the show looks incredible as would be expected from Production I.G. Right from the beginning, the visuals impress with a stunning space battle that is cold and mechanical, but amazing to behold nonetheless. In contrast, the never-ending ocean of Earth and city-like fleet of Gargantia are brimming with liveliness. There is a naturalistic beauty to the settings: the clear blue sky and the shimmering water below that goes well beyond the horizon, the underwater ecosystems, the light of the glowfish at night; it is all breathtaking to look at. Gargantia itself is quite a sight, equal parts fantastical and makeshift. The boat-dwelling people of Gargantia have a rudimentary grasp on technology compared their ancestors, but resourceful and learned to live with what little lost technology they can scavenge and whatever nature provides them; it is easy to see this by just looking at the place where they live. The character designs by Hanaharu Naruko are diverse, colorful, and lively. Clear emphasis is put on female characters (the show loves to flaunt their bodies), but the guys are also quite distinctive; something that is fairly rare in anime. Of special note is the tan Ledo develops during his time on Earth, which is a nice subtle touch.\\n\\n\r\nThe music by Taro Iwashiro is mostly composed of orchestral pieces. It is nothing innovative, but it is very well composed and most certainly effective. The music is broad and versatile, which is for the best because Gargantia has a wide range of tones. The compositions support the calm quite moments and warm touching moments just as effectively as tension filled arguments and battles. Probably the most impressive thing the music accomplishes is capturing a sense of wonder. After living on a confining military space colony all his life, the wind open Earth must be awe inspiring for Ledo; the music as well as the visuals imbues the show with a feeling of discovery and adventure.\\n\\n\r\nThough it is too naive to really be called a mature work, Suisei no Gargantia is certainly not a bad show. It is really quite enjoyable; it has likable characters, great art and animation, and a well developed lead. It's theme of how people in a community support one another is so good-natured that I feel kind of bad calling it out on its naivety. Still, the lack of development to the overall cast outside of being likable, and the simplifying of complex themes prevent it from being something great.  \\n",

            "content": "This review entails some  spoilers and, potentially, offensive regards to anime.\r\n^\r\n^\r\nSo. The two problems this anime faces are characterization and plot. The two key components of what make a good story. I'm just going to condense it down for ease and simplicity.\r\nGargantia had a lot of potential in the first few episodes. We're introduced to Ledo, a young man who lives among a space-colonized community of humans. However, all he and his fellow kin know is war against cephalopod(octopi, squids) aliens. Piloting highly advanced and durable AI, Ledo isn't accustomed to much outside of his mecha, \"Chamber\". As given by the summary, we prettymuch know the basics of everything else. When landing upon Earth, the very foundation of his life is put into question and he must battle his ruthless dogma with the mercy-based morality of the Earthen humans.\\n\\n\r\nNow, to just get straight to what I want to address, I'm going to talk characters and keep it as short and to-the-point as possible of me. Apologies for the poor construction ahead.\\n\\n\r\nLedo is, truthfully, one of the extremely few characters that was carrying this show, with Chamber being his only rival as such. Bevel and Oldham had their moments, but their screen-time was little and as such, isn't really much of a basis to go off from. Anyways, Ledo(as we see in the first episode) is very logical, analytic and precise, something that was likely learned from his constant interaction with a robot. He seeks constant guidance from Chamber and the two work together to figure out what they're dealing with, being aided by a girl named Amy. He is, however, open to change and thinks on a deeper level, attempting(constantly) to understand the ways of the people of Earth when they weren't doing the same in turn. There are some very good moments where Ledo expresses his horror, confusion and irritation toward truths of his mission and the mannerisms of his new commune. There are also terrible moments where his entire character is goofed up for the sake of a smile or small giggle.\\n\\n\r\nNow, Amy would have been a fine character... except for the fact that her friends and a portion of other characters nearly share the exact same archetype. Carefree, loved, sweet, and lively. There is very little depth to her, and she's your typical sweethearted heroine. Amy serves as a catalyst for Ledo's position in the society of Gargantia, and is a key component in his moral struggles, but that's pretty much it. There's very little exploration of who she is as a person and why she does what she does or why she is the way she is. Her only role in the anime is to be Ledo's guiding light, and she doesn't do a particularly fantastic job at it... unless just throwing him at people to talk to was her only purpose. Then she did great.\\n\\n\r\nPinion is a mess. The character initially hates Ledo with every fiber of his being and suddenly just becomes best bro's with the kid when seeing him, Ledo, down in the dumps over personal conflict. Pinion just randomly offers a hand to Ledo after continually trying to make the head of the ship get rid of him, and treats him like a brother very early on in the series. Again, there was no explanation for this change of character. It was like Pin was meant to be a rival and after a few episodes in, they just completely scrapped that idea. His history was passed over briefly and the character is pretty much an idiot and comedy relief. He has one or two truly mature moments in the entire thirteen episodes. A comic character isn't bad... but like I said, Pinion is a messy character. He is severely lacking in structure.\\n\\n\r\nChamber, on the other hand, is quite deep for being an artificial creation. As we expect, he's intelligent and can do all that cool robot-y stuff like scanning and predicting the future through complex analyzing to blowing crap up, but he himself has his inbuilt information challenged with knowledge learned throughout the show and ends up being more of a human than the human characters. And what I mean by that is he was given a developed personality... despite being a machine. Out of all the characters to choose from, they give the second most development of character to a hunk of freaking metal. I'm wont complain, anyways. At least they didn't give the entire mantle to a 16 year-old boy.\\n\\n\r\nBevel(an intelligent young boy) and Oldham(the only doctor of Gargantia?), like I said, didn't get much view time and had little spotlight. However, Bevel is very much a reason for Ledo's inner conflicts and Oldham is that \"wise old sage\" type that is suppose to balance out the immaturity of the rest of the cast, but can't because it's so overwhelming here with his sparse appearances. I'd try to be more explanatory, but it's difficult to do without giving spoilers. The few moments they appear are fairly important to Ledo, so you'd just have to watch for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nMiscellaneous characters. I'm not going to name them because I truthfully cannot even remember that much. There's a redheaded woman and another with black hair and glasses who leads the ship. Characters that seem to hold an important role, but are given no real depth and very little background. The pirate princess, who comes to their aid in the end of the series-- after being their enemy and a major threat to the lives just about everyone(the relationship was beneficial, but for whatever reason she comes to share a random friendship towards Pinion that has no development at all), is just a mess of a character again. Her intentions aren't remotely clear nor ever explained.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the plot... it's very weak and typical. This anime would have been far better off just exploring the psychological aspects of a child bred for war, taught \"survival of the strong\" ideals and merciless killing with having to question themselves against what it actually means to be human and what freedom of choice is. Ledo's growth as a character was good, but could have been phenomenal in the right hands. With the contrived plot and ending, this anime was just mistreated. The vast majority of the cast is shallowly written, every episode past seven is just an awkward clutter of poor development-- with few shining moments(all involving Ledo), and it's just another typical hurriedly-written anime that just can't deliver something more.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this for the average anime viewer because it's something that appeals to the masses. It's simple and very lighthearted, which to me, was a pitfall. Comedy isn't a bad thing, by any means, but anime anymore just focuses too much on goofy situations that don't have any sort of place in the story. Gargantia, unfortunately, is plagued by quite a bit of that.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a terrible show, but it's not amazing, either. If you're looking to waste a few hours, or a day, then this wouldn't be a bad anime to do that with. It's short and easy to understand.",

            "content": "I skipped over this series at first. Didn't know anything about it, and not being a particular fan of mecha anime I just assumed it wasn't going to be for me. Then I happened to decide to finally finish up Psycho-Pass which I had started not too long ago. That series was immensely satisfying for me and left me wanting more. Hopefully a second season of Psycho-Pass will eventually come... but in the mean time, I decided to see what else the writer had his name attached to and came back to this. I decided to shove my preconceptions aside and give it a watch.Now I can say that without a doubt, after Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero, Psycho-Pass and this curious little gem of a series I will follow this writer, Gen Urobuchi, wherever he next goes.\\n\\n\r\nSuisei no Gargantia is definitely an odd little series. I started off seriously unimpressed. Halfway into the first episode I was ready to turn it off. I was greeted by impenetrable space battles with flashy mechas piloted by characters who had given no reason to care about them. It felt exactly like the kind of thing I dread and lead me to believe Urobuchi had finally struck out. Sticking with it though, the second half of the episode stuck the hooks in deep and introduced an instantly likable female lead, a colorful, attractive band of characters and an interesting and imaginative world to explore. I soon realized the anime wasn't at all what I thought it was. What I saw instead was an immensely satisfying study of society and relationships with real heart on display, not another of the showy mecha fight series you can find just anywhere. \\n\\n\r\nThe series looks amazing. The art direction is superb and most of the shots look gorgeous. It's Production I.G., so maybe that goes without saying, but regardless it's a strikingly beautiful series. No complaints on how anything sounds either; the voice actors all do a good job and the music is usually pleasant and suitable. The character designs are very appealingly glossy and attractive. First rate stuff all around.\\n\\n\r\nI like the characters. The male lead is believable in his role, and though initially hard to identify with, becomes increasingly sympathetic as he opens up to the world around him. The female lead, Amy, is effortlessly likable; Urobuchi had proven to be really good with somewhat understated but resilient and spirited female leads, and she's no exception. The supporting cast is pretty good, I guess. I find myself liking them and the designs are great, but many of them aren't well developed at this point. The mecha itself is a kind of amusing character.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, Gargantia is immensely likable. Not as thought provoking as other Urobuchi works, or as  intense for that matter, but that's kind of the point I think. It's a show that rides on emotion. It's very much about feeling, and personally, I've thus far found it to be nothing but evocative.  An unexpected pleasure through and through.\\n\\n\r\nUpdate: Having now completed Gargantia, I feel the need to add a bit of an addendum to my initial review. Later in the series it shifts focus rather considerably; sacrificing a lot of the sentiment it conveyed so well through the first stretches of the series to try and be somewhat more thought provoking. Everything still works in my opinion and looking at it it's clearly the story Urobuchi was always going to tell here, but it is still somewhat disappointing. Amy, who is the crucial character in why the show works so well at first is shoved aside, only meriting a few appearances per episode in later episodes. It starts to feel a bit less earnest, and then it all concludes with a string of mecha action sequences that are only so satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nI would still say I admire this is a very well-made, and overall exceedingly enjoyable anime experience. It's very earnest and I commend Urobuchi for stepping away from his usual work somewhat, especially for the first half or so. Really it's easy to say that it might have been better if he had gone even further as Gargantia really does work it's best in the quieter, more understated slice of life moments. That said, while this show didn't do quite what I wanted it to, and for it it will miss the perfect ten score I've given to Urobuchi's other works, I still keep it at a nine and eagerly anticipate future projects from the writer.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nWatching Suisei no Gargantia is like watching someone who is completely incompetent play a good video game for an extended period of time. Is there anything more aggravating? They ignore obvious powerups right in front of their face, they never know what attack to use at what time, and they have absolutely no idea where they are going. As much as you desperately would like to take the reigns or at least guide them in the right direction, you simply can\u2019t. This process is universally frustrating and cringe-worthy because you know that if this person were only playing correctly, you would be ableto see the gameplay in all its glory. Instead, you end up sitting through hours of moronic lollygagging that goes utterly nowhere. To make a long story short, Gargantia is a comparably pointless and meandering ordeal despite the obvious potential for a heartwarming, meaningful, and even thought-provoking story that it at one point seemed destined to eventually arrive at.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: In the distant future, The Human Galactic Alliance has been constantly fighting for its survival against a race of beings called \"Hidiaazu.\" During an intense battle, a soldier named Ledo and his humanoid mecha \u201cChamber\u201d are sent spiraling through time and space. Several months later, Ledo wakes up from his artificially induced hibernation and realizes that he has arrived on planet Earth; the birthplace of humanity. The life he has known as an HGA soldier differs drastically from the culture he now finds here on Earth, as he struggles mightily to adjust to the new environment.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to give Gargantia credit for anything, I\u2019d praise the fact that\u2019s it\u2019s ambitious. It simultaneously aspires to be a thriller, a slice of life, a romance, a commentary on morality, and a mecha-action. Unfortunately, its own ambition coupled with some god awful writing resulted in an incomprehensible mess of plot holes, no direction what so ever, and so many irrelevant subplots that it becomes difficult to even comprehend what the show\u2019s primary narrative even is. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to be lured into Gargantia via its bright animation and intriguing first couple of episodes, but every good aspect it ever manages to establish goes to waste simply because it refuses to pick an identity at any point; this anime has NO idea what it wants to be. My first guess was that it was going to be a charming slice of life about a young man discovering what it really means to live, but then it decides to go on an incoherent, pointless, and shock-factor driven tangent that tries to introduce aspects of action, psychology, and suspense without an ounce of the narrative framework required to successfully do so. It\u2019s almost comical when you realize in hindsight how irrelevant and pointless this anime\u2019s little \u201cShyamalan Twist\u201d was to the main storyline. When the aspect of the narrative that\u2019s slated to carry the most emotional weight can be removed entirely without anything being different, something is wrong.  VERY wrong. But, surprisingly, one of the most nonsensical plot twists in anime history isn\u2019t even the biggest issue facing Gargantia\u2019s plot, because that title goes to the entire 2nd half of the anime, which is the most horrible, confused, and plothole laced 6-7 episodes I think I have ever seen. To sum all this up in a single sentence, Gargantia\u2019s plot is absolute garbage. This is far and away the worst thing that writer Gen Urobuchi has ever written or will ever write again, ESPECIALLY when you consider the characters:\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist, Ledo, is the only character in this show. That\u2019s right; you heard me. There are no other characters. LITERALLY everyone else in this show is a plot device. Amy, the female lead and love interest, is as 1-dimmensional as it gets. No personality, no motivations (partially because she barely does anything), no backstory, no nothing. She exists only so we can pretend that Ledo formed a bond with one of these boring sacks at some point. The closest thing this show ever gets to a character (besides Ledo) who exists for purposes other than advancing the plot IS A GODDAMN ROBOT. That\u2019s right; Chamber, Ledo\u2019s robot, is the closest thing to a side character that you are going to get. Notice the emphasis on the word \u201cclose\u201d, since Chamber is still an information-spewing plot device. The laughable way in which the show eventually tries to portray some sort of bond between Ledo and a robot makes the god-awful writing all the more cringe-worthy. Oh, and in case you didn\u2019t guess it already, Ledo is a bad character. They try to convince you at the end that he learned something and went through some kind of change but\u2026 When? It never feels like he\u2019s learning something nor does it ever feel like he\u2019s ever changing. Not to mention that his inconsistent reactions to events around him amplify the show\u2019s glaring plotholes. *Sigh... It\u2019s just really, REALLY bad writing for the complete lack of a better term. Putting it as bluntly as that is the best way I can think to sum it up.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Gargantia is not worth your time and it will only cause you immense disappointment if anything at all. One of my least favorite reviewer-clich\u00e9s is to go on and on about how \u201cThis anime had potential\u201d, because EVERY anime has potential; you aren\u2019t really saying anything with that. In this case, however, I really feel like this anime could have been special. If it had merely picked ONE out of the multiple great ideas it had and focused on it, this might have been one my favorites. Instead, it\u2019s shit. Storytelling is fickle, I suppose.",

            "content": "Terse, trite, and tried to do too much.\r\n*This review contains some spoilers for the show*\r\nSuisei no Gargantia was my anticipated show of the season; written by Urobuchi Gen [the mind behind novel renditions of derivative works such as Madoka Magica (to Faust), Psycho-Pass (to works such as BNW/1984), Saya no Uta (to Lovecraftian works), Kikokugai, and so forth], and animated by a studio adept with handling most subjects [Production I.G.]. I was looking forward to it; his works not only make the audience think, but they\u2019re often crafted intricately \u2014 excelling in both plot, characterization, and ultimately, presentation.\r\nBut the result? A mercurial series effusive withheroism, bad writing, and awkward, fickle characters. If in a work, the plot is meant to complement the character, and the character the plot, then in this aberration, the plot advances the characters forward, without any heed to the intricacies of how a character actually develops.\\n\\n\r\nLedo\u2019s our protagonist; he\u2019s accentuated to be servile to the mechanical acquiescence of militant dogma, and stubborn to the root; throughout the series, he constantly shifts between having the fervor of a Westboro Baptist preacher when it comes to the holistic condemnation of an entire race, and being an average teenager with notice towards morals and emotion. His character wasn\u2019t really given the \u2018right\u2019 treatment; the former half of the series revolved around making him more human \u2014 the series was fairly enjoyable during this period; the developments weren\u2019t shaky, and it seemed reasonable for him to be initially belligerent towards the foreign preaching of \u2018love\u2019, family, and morals. However, at a breaking point, he essentially left his learned insight bereft, and committed an act antithetical to what he was being developed to be. After that, he becomes a clock-reaction of sorts; fickle to change between being that guy driven by visceral emotion, and being that guy driven by the stringent tenets of the military [for example; during the last episode, he was willing to risk his life for the sake of 'love' towards a girl that he never so as much blushed at, while a few episodes previous, he had condemned her kind to be plain, detestable savages].\\n\\n\r\nBut he\u2019s not the only erratic character in the series. The characters that were developed the most consistently and the \u2018best\u2019, were the ones that were linear and simple; Amy, the heroine, remained consistent, and her actions sought no faults in relative reason \u2014 the nascent commander was devoted an entire episode of development, perhaps the simplest, albeit more realistic progression of character development within the series. Then we have the chain of ridiculously dubious characters; we have the pirate, emblematic of pride, greed, and cruelty, turn contrary during the final episodes into becoming an altruistic hero [\"I'll help you if you give me X; helps without mentioning X again]. We have the mechanic, characterized by an ambivalence between avarice, pride, and greed, all the while holding onto apparent, blatant empathy towards his associates. We also have the mecha, austere in judgement, and strict in dogma \u2014 to valiantly sacrifice itself for the sake of inexplicable love.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the science fiction within the series. There\u2019s a dichotomy of science-fiction series; there\u2019s the series that integrate an explanation for every development [an allusion to a real-world theory, or a pragmatic explanation falling within real-world boundaries], and series that hold the term \u2018science-fiction\u2019 nominally. Suisei no Gargantia belongs to the second category. The series doesn\u2019t attempt to explain most of the occurrences; the plot revolves around the protagonist falling through from one location to another \u2014 the series never attempts to explain how or why. The series bases the primary plot off of an enigmatic lifeform by the appellation of \u201cHideauze\u201d, yet its explanations for its origin are incredibly antithetical to how science actually works [We can't even engineer a major modification for genes within the same species, yet Suisei no Gargantia is comfortable with engineering modifications past the phylum ].\\n\\n\r\nYou also can\u2019t forget the structure of the series. The latter half basically bereaves the mood and developments that the former half worked so hard to craft; if the former half were viewed as a standalone, slice of life, and the latter half, individually as an action series, then perhaps, the respective halves would not be so awkward. But when coalesced, you get an erratic amalgamation of dissonant factors devoid of the slightest harmony. Suisei no Gargantia had thirteen episodes to craft a holistic, reasonable story; they spent half of it on slice of life, and the other half, on erratic plot; they attempted to do far too much within a simple one-cour series [most plot-heavy series require a two-cour season]. The former half made use of the tranquil soundtrack that offered vestigial aid to the latter half, while the latter half boasted forgettable tracks, integrated as simple filler music [also have to note its liberal use of flashbacks, without any further attempt to attenuate its ambiguity, or the usages of dei ex machina with its sudden reveals of certain weapons] .\\n\\n\r\nWhile a work isn\u2019t exactly entirely dependent on the obscure laws of presentation, and of reasonable development, it certainly should at its very core, leave the audience entertained. Yet, it\u2019s hard for me to say that for Suisei; his works as noted, are novel renditions of derivative series \u2014 this work, is awfully similar to his most recent work. More than that, like the previous work, was incredibly vocal with making the characters literally express the themes and the ideas of the work. There\u2019s not grace in conveyance when you\u2019re having a protagonist scream his philosophies in an aggravating, 'let this guy die please' way, and it\u2019s made less so when you have the opponent rebut back in an equally vehement manner [\"You're being immature? I will too].\\n\\n\r\nThe flaw with the series had to do with its potential of being able to easily devote thirteen episodes into crafting an affable slice of life, or even thirteen episodes of reasonable science-fiction, to come short with half a season of shaky developments, and another half of retrospective unimportance. When you force down every other genre down on a series, you might get a stride of adventitious enjoyment, but most of the time, simply avoidable frustration.",

            "content": "Suisei no Gargantia is the latest work of the (in)famous Gen Urobuchi, who did Psycho Pass last season (IG) and the more known, Fate/Zero and Madoka Magica.\r\nWhile I did enjoy the latter, Psycho Pass was pretty bad and so had no high expectations of another sci fi with Gen Urobuchi and IG behind it.\r\nThe show is still airing and I will edit some parts later on, but my overall impressions of the show are set and will only tweaked slightly after the end which will come soon.\r\nStory\r\nSuisei no Gargantia (Gargantia) sets in the distant future, humanity has escaped Earth and fights squid like Aliens calledHideauze in space with spaceships and Mechas.\\n\r\nOne of those mecha pilots is Ledo, the protagonist.\\n\r\nAfter a fight with hideauze he gets suck into a wormhole and ends up on earth which has changed dramatically and now is a water planet.\\n\r\nWith his high tech Mecha Chamber he stays at a (for him) primitive ship called Gargantia, learns the culture and language of the people who stayed on earth.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot moves very slowly, shows you the way people live on earth and deal with everyday tasks. Ledo is \"forced\" into learning the habits of Gargantia and forgetting about his soldier life.\\n\r\nThere are various themes addressed in the show, like what is the value of a human life that is not productive for society (eugenics), co existing with the environment and other human beings, the freedom to do what you want and not what you are ordered to.\\n\\n\r\nIt all sounds nice on paper but Gargantia lacks pretty in that regard. The waste time on fanservice, boring side events and after a while you don't really know what the show is even about.\\n\r\nIs it some sort of anti-war piece?\\n\r\nPro environment?\\n\\n\r\nThankfully the plot advances after it is shown that there are Hideauze on earth and Ledo finds his duty to kill them.\\n\r\nThis leads to some drama, because the Gargantians think of the Hideauze as somewhat holy and don't want to kill them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here I need to make a clear cut. Up onto this point the show wasn't bad, just boring, but episode 9 turned over the entire show.\\n\r\nI don't wanna spoil it yet I feel compelled to do so, since it was outright ridiculous what happened.\\n\\n\r\nAll I can say is that it suddenly becomes inconsistent, cliche and stupid at the same time.\\n\r\nIt's typical Gen Urobuchi shock factor and emotion manipulation which turns the Story into a complete mess that is just laughable.\\n\r\nI have no idea what to expect of the ending, but it's really hard to get your head out of that rope.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nAs usual for IG shows and Urobuchi, the characters are the worst part of the show.\\n\r\nThey are lifeless and have weak personalities, feel unnatural and more like plot devices than real people. \\n\r\nThey behave childish and immature and have no sense of consistency. Especially Ledo as it is shown in episode 9, as he does a 180\u00b0 and behaves totally out of character.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also as usual unlikable and you cannot relate to them, people die... you don't care.\\n\r\nSad things happen... you don't care.\\n\\n\r\nI do blame Urobuchi for this, since the other IG show Attack on Titan (even though a shounen) has much more relatable characters, even if they reek of cliche and simpleness.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation\\n\\n\r\nWe get our typical high standards for animation and art that IG delivers. Not outstanding but very solid.\\n\r\nThe action scenes are great, the colors are vibrant and the backgrounds lush.\\n\r\nThe only problem I had were the female character designs.\\n\r\nAll look a bit slutty and their faces put me off. I know they hired a guy who normally draws hentai characters, so no wonder there. But to me they look like slutty K-On! characters.\\n\r\nThe males on the other hand are pretty good looking though.\\n\\n\r\nThe CGI Mecha and special effects don't bother me and are actually quite good especially in the first episode very nice special effects with many different neon colors. Spacy.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe score for Gargantia is surprisingly weak. The opening and endings are bad (if not horrible) and the background music forgettable.\\n\r\nThe voice actors doing an average job, though I give credit for the fantasy language Ledo uses. It's awkward but creative.\\n\r\nThe sound effects have a good impact and are high quality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Value\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason the show gets hyped again, mostly because Gen Urubuchi is working on it. But if you ask me the shows is even worse than Psycho Pass and that show was pretty bad already.\\n\\n\r\nI mostly forced myself to watch it up until episode 9 which was actually good for the first half until it became laughable to the end and I literally burst out in laughing at times out of sheer ridiculousness.\\n\\n\r\nIt did add to the enjoyment but in a bad way. I cannot take the show serious and I can never take Urobuchi serious again. This show as the nail in the coffin and will close the chapter of Urobuchsi work for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArtstyle +1 (looks pretty nice, lush colors and realistic looks, gives you a nadia of the blue water feeling)\\n\r\nQuality +1 ( Good IG animation)\\n\r\nBackground +1 (beautiful water scenes, nice textures on the ships)\\n\r\nCharacter Designs -1 ( the female character designs ruin it for me)\\n\r\nVisual Effects +1 (decent use of cgi, nice special effects for lasers and so on)\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting 0 (your standard modern voice acting)\\n\r\nOpening and Ending -1 (terrible terrible terrible)\\n\r\nSoundtrack 0 (not mentionable but also not bad)\\n\r\nSound Effects +1 (good use of effects)\\n\\n\r\nStory or Content 3/10\\n\\n\r\nPremise and Setting +1 (as usually good premise for Urobuchi shows)\\n\r\nPacing -1 (fillers, silly slice of life, boring funeral episode)\\n\r\nComplexity 0 (simple stuff that just tries to be more complex than it is)\\n\r\nPlausibility -1 (none, it\u2019s space magic and misunderstood science when ep9 happens)\\n\r\nConclusion 0 (will most likely be not good based on where the story stands now)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 2/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonality -1 (walking, talking plot devices)\\n\r\nBehavior and Chemistry -1 (unrealistic and out of character, forced drama)\\n\r\nDevelopment and Progression 0 (simplistic)\\n\r\nMotivation and Backdrop 0 (almost none)\\n\r\nLikability -1 (no one was likable)\\n\\n\r\nValue & Enjoyment 1,5/10  rounded down to 1/10\\n\\n\r\nValue -0,5\\n\\n\r\nSentimental -0,5 (will forget about this as soon as I can)\\n\r\nHistorical 0 (not as big as an impact as his other work, will be forgotten)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -3\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation +0 nothing spectacular\\n\r\nSound -1 boring soundtrack and terrible OP\\n\r\nStory and Content -1 stupid makes me cringe\\n\r\nCharacters -1 boring again, no relation to them\\n\\n\r\nOverall score 3,8 ~ 4/10 (bad)\\n\\n\r\nSuisei no Gargantia will have some fans who think it is smart. I thought it was not only stupid but also weak in its exposition.\\n\r\nIt was boring to watch and had nothing to offer.\\n\r\nIts messages are not clear and even if they were I do not agree with them.\\n\\n\r\nIt's Urobuchi attempting to do the same trick he did so many times before and fails harder every time.\\n\\n\r\nStop making sci fi shows if you can't explain anything, it will only end up creating plot holes.\\n\r\nFocus on fantasy like Fate/Zero and Madoka, at least there you can explain everything with magic and focus on the character drama or action.",

Well, this is what Gargantia is all about. It gives the impression of being an all-out action mecha anime, but before you realize, it becomes something else. \r\nThe first episode begins, and we are quickly taken into a rather pro-active exposition of the show's world: The humanity is in danger, and we must fight the ultimate battle against some Whale-squid-like creatures that inhabit the outer space called \"Hideazu\"!!. Somehow, the attack plan backfires and our MainCharacter is thrown into a wormhole. But something went wrong, and our character is now stuck in a place where he has no idea about, and his life will change completely.\\n\\n\r\nYou might have guessed, the place where our character arrives, is the Earth itself. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is mostly about our main character's development, but you may find some surprises. The exposition and exploration of its own world and ideas is one of the reasons why this anime is such an amusing and deep experience. There's a point when you'll start thinking and looking deep into yourself as a person and your purposes in life. Ambitions and goals are really important to grow up and find your own freedom.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and Art are simply fantastic, as it holds high production values. Every atmosphere is achieved perfectly and helps a lot to the inmersion.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was rather short for the development it needed, but it never fails to amuse.

            "content": "If I look back on my experience with Suisei no Gargantia, I can feel the chills of the sea and space envelop my body as a whole. \r\nWhat a ride. \r\nSuisei no Gargantia was definitely one of the animes I always looked forward to watching every week when a new episode came out, and I believe it does deserve plenty of recognition for what it has done. \r\nStory: 8\r\nThe premise from the get-go was very promising - humanity has been forced to leave Earth and is driven to the deep reaches of space, developing highly advanced technology to combat strange foes that spell doom forhumanity. I liked it. However, like with any other anime I watch, I was sure not to get my hopes up to high in case the rest of the anime didn't deliver on the set-up. Fortunately, my caution was not necessary since I was well-satisfied with the content that I was gifted. \\n\\n\r\nThe concept of a futuristic human coming down to Earth, not knowing that it was his race's planet of origin, by itself provided numerous elements to the anime. It provided initial humor at his surprise with some discoveries and engaging action as he explored the now barren realms of Earth's body. When Ledo and Chamber run into some of the indigenous people, a spark of conflict then provides the backbone to the rest of the story, breathing forth a tale of cultural conflicts and drama, with a hint of romance. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is what you would expect out of many of the \"generic\" anime you see in modern times. Nothing new is introduced, but usually that's the way I like it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nMusic and voice acting both completed their jobs well. Their existence was noted, but did not dominate the anime with their presence. They managed to stay discreet and not bring too much attention to themselves, just like they should. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nI think this category is what really did it for me. \\n\\n\r\nLedo is a wonderful character to analyze by himself. As the anime progresses, there is a clear change in his character and his way of thinking. The show does a superb job of showing how Ledo struggles and wrestles with the idea that the ways that he was taught up in space may not be acceptable. While he is very powerful and easily overpowers all of the beings on Earth with Chamber, he is not shown to be invincible, which is something I can really appreciate. \\n\\n\r\nChamber also is a very potent presence in the anime and appears to be Ledo's last connection the world he left behind, causing him to be almost half of Ledo's life. Yet even though I held no expectations for him to surprise me as a character, he surprises me in the end and is the cause of one of the last chills to send down my spine for the anime. \\n\\n\r\nNow we have Amy, the heroine of our story. (For clarification, there are hints of romance between her and Ledo in the story, but it definitely does not consume a majority of the anime) For Amy, I have to say she provides nothing extraordinary as a character, but she definitely is not a hindrance to the anime - which is a lot better than other heroines in other anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are very colorful and have their own backstories that are all covered as the story progresses, and I have to say I found myself engaged in all of them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nFor a 13 episode anime, I have to say they did a wondrous job of compacting a relatively deep and engaging story without sacrificing the usual components such as character development, pacing, and purpose. Both thought-provoking and exciting in numerous regards, Suisei no Gargantia is one anime I would love to see more of in the future.",

            "content": "\"We are tied to the ocean. And when we go back to the sea, whether it is to sail or to watch, we are going back from whence we came.\" \r\nThe ocean is a grand, mysterious, and beautiful thing. At times the ocean is calm and soothing; at other times it is chaotic and disastrous. While the ocean can bring us many memorable spectacles and experiences, it can also be seen as tedious and tiresome. \r\nSuisei no Gargantia began with a lot of potential. Boasting action, mecha, sci-fi genres, beautiful animation, a gorgeous ocean scenery, and a strong pilot episode, one can\u2019t help but anticipatewhat this series has in store for its audience. Despite some interesting elements SnG had to offer, the show came short of meeting the standards it had originally set. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of SnG revolves around Ledo, our main character. As a soldier of the Galactic Alliance all Ledo has known since childhood is how to fight against an evolved species of space alien called the Hideauze. When he unintentionally gets sent to Earth due to an unfortunate chain of events and subsequently salvaged by Gargantia, he is bewildered by this sudden new environment. Earth is shrouded in vast amounts of water, capable of life without advanced technology, and full of mystery. He must then learn to adapt to this new place and befriend the people there if he hopes to survive. His struggle to fit in with his new acquaintances felt peaceful, fun, and overall fairly entertaining. It felt like a slice of life. Thematically, SnG does a good job at addressing key issues like faults with human nature, violence, morality, and struggles with self-identity. \\n\\n\r\nWhat SnG really struggles with story-wise is pacing. More than half of the series is Ledo attempting to fit in with the people of Gargantia and make friends; however, the final few episodes try to incorporate a darker atmosphere and falls short on leaving a lasting impression. There are a couple plot twists here and there that are supposed to surprise the audience but, for the most part, felt predictable; there were several instances where I found myself saying, \"I saw that coming.\" They added more Sci-Fi elements around the end, which I found to be somewhat intriguing, and attempted a sort of natural selection type concept. While I appreciate the idea the series tried to incorporate, it felt much too constricted time-wise to be of much enjoyment. If a certain beach equivalent fan service episode had been replaced with a different episode expanding on the story, SnG may have turned out better. \\n\\n\r\nAs I have said before, the Art/Animation of SnG is visually enticing. Production I.G. typically does a great job at making sure their productions look superb and it shows in Suisei no Gargantia. Colors are very vibrant, the scenery is great, and the animation is fluid; I have no qualms here. Transitioning to the sound portion, I say that overall this section was decent. The OP and ED aren't bad, but there's nothing that stands out too much in them. Sound effects and voice acting are also fair. Something I found commendable was how the show tried something fresh with the language barrier between Ledo and the people of Gargantia. \\n\\n\r\nLedo is the protagonist of the series, and like all main characters he expectantly is subjected to the most character development over the span of the series. He\u2019s puts off the vibe of being a quiet, serious guy that takes his job as a soldier very seriously. He struggles to understand the nature of normal social interactions and picks things up along the way while living on Gargantia. The problem I had here is that Ledo is basically the only one who really gets any development. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the most disappointing aspects of SnG is that the rest of the characters besides Ledo are left in the dust in terms of development and depth. While Amy is supposed to be the main female lead, she seems more like a pretty supporting side character whose only goal is to be a cheerleader and moral support for Ledo. Development-wise I\u2019m not really even quite sure how she developed such an attachment to Ledo because it really isn\u2019t shown in much detail. It seems that she simply is attracted to Ledo because he\u2019s the main character and is apparently a good looking fella. Overall she\u2019s a pretty clich\u00e9 female lead. Chamber, though simply a pilot survival A.I., was probably my favorite 'character' of this series; his witty robotic comments and confusion with human rationale on board Gargantia were consistently entertaining. There was one other character that got a bit of development towards the end, but it just so happened to be Pinion, a mechanic of Gargantia, and possibly the most irritating character of the entire series. When I say irritating, I mean filling \u2018the fool\u2019 character trope and more. He is constantly yelling, rude to nearly everyone, exploits people to satiate his own greedy ambitions, and seems to lack intelligent thought. \\n\\n\r\nSuisei no Gargantia embarked on its journey sailing smoothly, but slowly began treading in rocky waters in regards to plot and character quality. The only redeeming factor in the second half of the series is that the ending was surprisingly good; it\u2019s a happy ending for the most part and concludes the series well. The beginning and ending are exceptional but the series will leave you scratching your head wondering what happened in between. I wouldn't recommend anyone to jump on board and put this series in the number one position for 'Plan to Watch', but I also don't think the show warrants anyone to abandon ship.",

            "content": "Epic crazy battle robot? Or maybe a full-suspense atmoshphere?\r\nWell, thats usually appears in every mecha anime, but have you ever feel a mecha anime with heartwarming feeling? I bet not every mecha had that feeling before. I usually avoided mecha anime, I dont have any particular reasons. I always thought every mecha anime is quite generic like you have robot, you used that for battle then WHAM! (put battle scene in here) and voila! Here is a mecha anime. Surprisingly, Suisei no Gargantia is more than that.\r\nSTORY (9/10)\r\nSuisei no Gargantia is not your usual mecha anime, if you\u2019re looking for epicness mecha like Tengen ToppaGurren Lagann then Suisei no Gargantia is not what you\u2019re looking for. SnG (Suisei no Gargantia) takes a setting in post-apocalypse earth, when humanity cant no longer lives in Island because of some circumtances. Humanity now, are living in the ships. The story focussing on Ledo which is a soldier from another planet that being stranded in Gargantia (is the name of the ships). He is trying to lives in this ship and of course, the lives where he was lived before and in this ship are so different and in this anime, we will see how Ledo adapting in this new environment when the technology is more primitive than he comes from.\\n\\n\r\nSnG is more into slice of life aspects. They brings you a heartwarming feeling and more the pacing that they had was rather slow. It was admitable, because this anime is focussing on the details, like how Ledo (The main character) must learned the language in Gargantia (the place he had stranded) or on how people do their life in a big ship called Gargantia. So, prepare to heard so many dialogues. Although it was slow and many dialogue, but i bet you will enjoyed it in every minutes or even seconds. Even the premise of the story sounds simplistic but later in the story, the story will develop into something that will blows off your mind!\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime, the story was quie enjoyable and moreover, there some exciting twists that makes you feel \u201cAaaarghhh!\u201d and at the other time there was some heartwarming scene that makes you said \u201cOoohh....\u201d. Mixing feelings between heartwarming and some epic moments in this anime mix well and thats what makes Suisei no Gargantia is so appealing.\\n\\n\r\nART (10/10)\\n\r\nIf i could said, the art in this anime was the best among the other anime that same airing in Spring 2013 no.. even for the other anime. In this anime, They use colorful color and makeit so artistic. The background was heavenly beautiful. Maybe some of you thought, with ship as the background, does it will make the atmosphere dull and plain? You\u2019re wrong. Thats what i thought at the first time but when i watching this anime, the art makes the ship (Gargantia) looks so beautiful, rich colour, and brings out the cheerful atmospheres. From the art and the background itself i can tell that the atmosphere that the creator wants to make is cheerful one and that mixs well with the story and what i could said is the background is the greatest parts on this anime. Its so memorable and beautiful! Eyegasm!\\n\\n\r\nNot just with the background , the character design is the best too. There was a steampunk and sci-fi feels and more it was realistic. Like many of the girl characters is in brown skin, Well, they live in ship and received sunlight everday, thats quite logic. And what makes me more excited was the most character is unique, i usually side character have similiar design for each characters but its not in Suisei no Gargantia. Every character have their own uniqueness in terms of design like in the clothes or anything like that and not just the human character that was appealing, the mecha design is quite great too. For mecha like Chamber (a mecha that Ledo used), they use 3-D graphic. It makes the mecha looks so cool and moreover, its blended well with the rest of animation. A perfect art if i could said.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (8/10)\\n\r\nFor the songs, i found the opening song and the ending was quite catchy. I love the opening song \u201cKono Sekai \u201c by Minor Chihara , I never skip the OP parts, the song is so easy listening and quite catchy tunes. Its maybe my favorite OP for spring anime beside Shingeki no Kyojin OP. For the ending song, i dont really remember it. It doesnt have anything special.\\n\r\nFor the seiyuu, we have Hisaka Kanemoto for Amy, Kaito Ishikawa as Ledo, Ai Kayano as Saya. Maybe the one that you havent never heard before was Kaito Ishikawa. Well, i am actually surprised that he is a newcomer but the quality of his sound doesnt represent him as \u2018newcomer\u2019, it sounds like he is a pro seiyuu. He is really fits as Ledo, like when Ledo stutter after learning earth language, thats totally remarkable! I think he is doing his job very well. For other seiyuu, i think i dont have to mention all of them since we know their quality. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (9/10)\\n\r\nThe main character of this anime, Ledo is quite cool and attractive guy. He is really fits as the main character of this anime, not just because his looks but also the personality that he have. Gen Urobuchi seems making the character react for every events in most realistic way, like when Ledo stranded in Gargantia, He doesnt feel to comfortable with his new environment because it doesnt match with his stance (weak people doesnt deserve to die). I love the way how the character react to events in logic and realistic way, we can said, there isnt any action that bases from unrealistic thinking but its more about realistic and moreover the development in Ledo is quite remarkable, it was quite logic considering the environtment that he lives now, supporting him. Quite logic, huh?\\n\\n\r\nThe other main character that we should mention is, Amy. Amy is the first person that interact with Ledo, she is quite cheerful and cute person. I think she is my favorite character in this spring anime, I love the pairing within a cool and quiet guy with cheerful girls. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, i love all the characters in Suisei no Gargantia. They all have their own uniqueness and moreover there wasnt any character that being wasted, everyone have their own roles. Its like everyone have their own time to shine.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nWhen people focusses on Shingeki no Kyojin and Hataraku Maou Sama (airing same as Suisei no Gargantia).They forgot to mention one another great anime, its called Suisei no Gargantia. Not many people take their eyes on this anime. It such a waste if i can said. With superb art quality like Makoto Shinkai works (not in terms of realistic art but in artistic way) and heartwarming story, Suisei no Gargantia can take away my attention from SnK and i dont regret it. Dont said just because this is a mecha so you wouldnt watched it, believe me, i dont really like mecha too but this anime was different it was focussing on slice of life aspects. You will regret it if you miss this show!",

            "content": "There\u2019s a certain kind of excellence that I always pursue to discover within an anime - one that doesn\u2019t have categories for scores, but rather, lives by one rationale - the desire to achieve and execute a goal. If I can see such a desire within the production team of said anime, I don\u2019t have to rely on 1-10 scores or categories to judge an anime - I\u2019ll simply know that it will be good, because the people behind it, are passionate souls with a love for what they do.\r\nOf course, I\u2019m not here to rattle on about my definition about a \u201cgood anime\u201d butrather, to tell you my opinions of one that does fit the above descriptor - Suisei no Gargantia.\\n\\n\r\nSo, naturally, I can\u2019t simply give you my requirements for a good anime, and not apply them to Gargantia. The question is, obviously, did I see such passion within Gargantia? Absolutely. In fact, It\u2019s been awhile (three months) since an airing anime caught my attention in the same manner that Gargantia did. As soon as I watched the first episode, Gargantia struck me with potential. And to an extent, that potential was pretty well met.\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time though, it\u2019s kinda hard to just label Gargantia as an anime with a passionate production team, because if I did do that, this review would not only be very short, but very uninteresting. Gargantia, isn\u2019t just an anime with a passionate team, its an anime with an excellent setting, an excellent story, an excellent cast, and excellent art and sound. In almost all aspects, Gargantia is an excellent anime. A very excellent anime indeed.\\n\\n\r\nI can still recall that first episode - that amazing setting and plot, and that creative cliffhanger at the finale of the first episode of Gargantia. If there\u2019s one thing that I\u2019d pick out as my absolute favorite aspect of Gargantia, it would have to be it\u2019s setting and story. The premise is interesting - the remnants of humanity years after the abandonment of earth by the majority of earth\u2019s population. Although Gargantia takes a more relaxed pace in it\u2019s first few episodes exploring Ledo\u2019s daily life following his arrival to the now-water-filled Earth, Gargantia really picks up the pace halfway through it\u2019s season. Now, although it\u2019s refreshing to find an anime like this that isn\u2019t entirely story driven, I\u2019m kinda more partial to Gargantia leaning more towards the story side of the spectrum, and distancing itself from the daily life style that it took in it\u2019s first few episodes. That being said, although only half of Gargantia was focused on it\u2019s main story, those six episodes, were still very well realized. Not only was the climax of the story actually pretty suspenseful, it threw some fairly interesting plot twists along the way that made the storyline much more involving and interesting. Although I could see the argument that Gargantia's plot was somewhat underdeveloped being thrown, I\u2019d have to somewhat disagree. The first half of Gargantia didn\u2019t only prove to illustrate Ledo\u2019s daily life upon Gargantia, it also set a few things in motion that eventually led to the perpetration of what I would refer to as the main story. And even though the latter half, the \u201cmain story\u201d was somewhat packed, I still found the pacing of the entire anime quite good. Gargantia wasn\u2019t rushed, nor was it too slow, and the progression of events was written out quite well.\\n\\n\r\nThis, was well voiced through Gargantia\u2019s well-animated medium. One thing that instantly struck out to me about Gargantia, other than it\u2019s story, was it\u2019s style. The animation style of Gargantia is as per usual of most modern animes, quite good, with fairly fluid battle animations and excellent artwork. However, Gargantia takes it to a slightly higher level, and possesses a uniqueness to it\u2019s animation style that isn\u2019t present in many more recent animes. Not only is such a style unique, but it\u2019s also fitting to Gargantia alone, and compliments the anime as a whole. In my own opinion, that is how \u201cperfect\u201d animation artwork should be done. It shouldn\u2019t just be a sterile way to paint a story with some characters, it should be an entity on it\u2019s own, with it\u2019s own expressive abilities and it\u2019s own message. Gargantia\u2019s animation is a good example of that. The drawing style of Ledo, compared to the style of the rest of the earth inhabitants, is a very good example of this. In this case, it\u2019s the stark difference between the sterile, white-haired, pale skinned Ledo, to the naturally darker, more colorful antics of the inhabitants of Gargantia that really paints a message all in itself. See, that, is animation that adds to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was one place that didn\u2019t shine as bright as the other aspects of Gargantia, it would probably have to be the soundtrack. Although the opening and endings of Gargantia were good, and some could say, better than most, they weren\u2019t anything really special and incredible. Yes, they were good, however, they weren\u2019t as good in quality as the rest of the anime itself. Although the BGM escapes this, it doesn\u2019t do so by much, as such quality is almost expected of an anime in this modern day and time.\\n\\n\r\nTo make up for it\u2019s somewhat lackluster BGM and opening/ending, Gargantia actually has a pretty awesome cast. And it doesn\u2019t end there - the development on said cast, is really quite good for a 13-episode anime. In addition, unlike the story, which was biased more towards the latter half of the anime, the character development is excellent all the way through, only stunted slightly by the fast-paced nature of the latter half. Of course, I really can\u2019t talk about character development without mentioning the alien Ledo, as we can\u2019t really forget about the fact that Ledo is essentially a stranger in a strange, strange land. Not only is he a stranger, he\u2019s also a cut-out soldier with one unquestionable goal in mind, and possesses values that are very far from the values of those on this new, flooded earth. I think the development here, and the conflict, is quite obvious. It\u2019s amazing how much development is made within Ledo\u2019s character alone in just 13 episodes. Even more amazing, is probably the development of the surrounding characters - the members of Gargantia, and most interestingly, Ledo\u2019s machine caliber, Chamber. To be honest, I\u2019m actually partial on the \u201cdevelopment\u201d of Chamber as a character, as it was one of the more random aspects of Gargantia. It was pretty unexpected, and although I praise Gargantia for actually developing Chamber as a character, I know for a fact that I won\u2019t be alone if I decide to go along the path of deciding that it was probably a bad idea. There\u2019s another example of this, however, for the sake of not spoiling Gargantia for those who haven\u2019t watched it, I won\u2019t digress into that.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I will digress into though, is my dissapointment with Gargantia. Hell, don\u2019t read that wrong, I wasn\u2019t disappointed with Gargantia whatsoever as an anime. It was awesome. I was disappointed that there was only 13 episodes. I know I\u2019m not alone when I find myself wanting more, more of Ledo, more of Amy, more of Bellows and more of Pinion, and I know for a fact that I\u2019m probably not (probably) alone when I cry myself to sleep at night digressing over what I\u2019m going to do now that Gargantia\u2019s over. Wait, pretend you didn\u2019t read that last part. That\u2019s personal. In all seriousness though, the one thing that Gargantia needs, is a second season. It has so much promise as a legendary anime, and so much more content and possibilities that it could so easily explore that a second season seems only logical in my opinion. Not only would it be awesome, it would also probably be pretty popular as an anime, and I for one, fully support the creation of a second season, for I know that I\u2019ll see the same amount of passion in it as I did the first season. Because as it stands, the story of Gargantia has only begun. There\u2019s so many more things that I want to know, not only about Ledo, or the history of the Gargantia fleet, but about the history of Earth within the world of Suisei no Gargantia, the fate of the Galactic Alliance and the war, and the development in communication with the Hideauze.\\n\\n\r\nSo please, passionate staff of Gargantia, please, use that creative genius to the greatest extent and bring us more of this incredible anime.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be waiting, Gargantia.",

            "content": "Suisei no Gargantia (Gargantia On The Verdurous Planet) is a 13 episode television series produced by Production IG, and notable for being primarily written by Gen Urobuchi, the mind behind such shows as Madoka Magica and Fate/Zero. Now before I start this review proper, I feel it's important to note that while Urobuchi has a track record of writing very dark shows with many characters dying and falling into despair, Gargantia is a very much different kind of show for him, for while it contains many similar themes to what he has tackled before, the show has an overall much more positive message to it.But more on that later, for now, let's tackle the story.\\n\\n\r\nGargantia focuses on Ledo, a soldier in the Human Galactic Alliance, a coming together of the remnants of humanity in space to combat strange alien like lifeforms known as the \"Hideauze\". This has been Ledo's life since birth, fighting for humanities survival in the cruel confines of space. But when a mission goes wrong, Ledo inadvertently lands on a distant planet, far from the rest of his kind. When he wakes up, he is shocked to find himself on an inhabitable planet, where people live on the ocean in great united sea vessels, with none of the high tech technology Ledo is used to seeing. Even more surprising is that this world is a place that he had only heard of in myths, a place thought to be lost long ago: Earth.\\n\\n\r\nThe stories setup is simple, with a young man winding up in a new environment he's not used to at all, and his attempts to acclimate to the situation. But despite this, the story really shines because of it's solid execution that always leaves you wanting to know more about this world where people live on the open seas. You want to see how their lives are lived, what things have changed, what things have stayed the same. You'll also want to stay for the themes explored, such as what it really means to be a human, and what it really means to be happy and free. And most of all, you'll want to stay for the characters. \\n\\n\r\nGargantia has an amazing cast. Our protagonist, Ledo, is a typical hardcore soldier, who lives his life with a sort of \"My purpose is to kill enemies with no mercy, and nothing else\" sort of attitude about him. And this makes a lot of sense, considering that all he's known was fighting all his life. But on this new world, Ledo will be forced to change his ways and adapt to the much more peaceful, co-existent humans who live there. Over the course of the story, Ledo will constantly have to question his motives, wondering if he should stay true to what he was taught and be a soldier and nothing else, or if he should let his interactions with the humans of Earth change him and make him see that their's more to life. \\n\\n\r\nRounding out the cast, we have Chamber, a flying mech that also serves as a Pilot Interface System that Ledo uses throughout the show. Chamber is a typical AI most of the time, providing factual information and suggestions, while also inadvertently being hilarious. But Chamber is not just a lifeless shell, as he proves as the series goes on by slowly showing more and more advanced thoughts. In addition to Chamber, we have Amy, the first Earth human that Ledo interacts with, and the one who really shows him the ropes of living on their ship, The Gargantia. Then there's Pinion, the excavator who has an obsession with unearthing the treasures of the past, and is determined to have Ledo help him. Finally, there's Ridget, who struggles with trying to take command of the fleet and will need all the help she can get to keep the crew of The Gargantia together. There are many more characters in addition to these, and all of them have their own distinct personalities and quirks.\\n\\n\r\nIn a show with only thirteen episodes, it would be understandable if only a few characters got the spotlight while the others were put on the backburner a bit. But that is not the case here. While it is true that more focus goes onto some characters than others, each one has their chance to shine, and they all have grown in some way by the end. Sadly, the story does take a bit of a hit due to the lack of episodes however, with the ending feeling a bit rushed. Gargantia definitely could have been a 24 episode show, as there was much more that could have been done with the world and characters in that time. But considering they were only working with 13 episodes, the creators did a fantastic job of fitting everything in, even if it did feel a bit rushed at the end.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a production values standpoint, Gargantia is very good. The music is fairly standard fare, fitting the mood but never really standing out. The opening and ending are quite good however, with the next episode preview situated nicely in the actual ending itself.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the animation, there isn't much to complain about. All in all, there isn't a whole lot of action in Gargantia, but even so the animation remains crisp and fluid throughout, using a lot of bright colors and backgrounds that really show off the fleet of The Gargantia nicely. Character designs are all well done, and when the show does hamper down and there IS action, the fine folks at Production IG remind us just how amazing they can be, and provide us with some even better visuals. All in all, the animation of Gargantia in excellent. \\n\\n\r\nSo at the end of the day, Gargantia is a great watch, packed with colorful animation, a well written story, and interesting characters. It may have been a bit better with a longer run time, but I came out of Gargantia very satisfied regardless, and I would recommend this anime to just about anyone.",

            "content": "Suisei no Gargantia is a recent mecha series from Production I.G, which doesn't tell me much since they've been involved in quite a few projects some good and some terrible. There is an ongoing manga adaptation by Mitogawa Wataru. It came out before the actual anime, but the anime was in production long before the manga's release. I have heard virtually nothing about it, so I'm going into this one pretty much blind. I hope it turns out better than the last time I said that. I need something at least tolerable after Cheese Steak Suppository and School Days or I may have to startdrinking and that would just be playing into the cultural stereotype. Let's take a look and find out.\\n\\n\r\nOur story begins with a group of mecha pilots preparing to do battle against crustaceans, in space. You know, this may not be a very scientifically accurate anime. Still, I have to admit that it is kind of an awesome concept. The battle follows our protagonist, Ensign Ledo. Who ends up getting separated from the rest of his team. When he regains consciousness, his AI partner, Chamber, informs him that he's been in artificial hibernation for quite some time and their location is unknown. All they know for certain is that they're surrounded by people they can't understand the language of, who are trying unsuccessfully to take Chamber apart. One of the problems with the story is that it's kind of predictable. You can tell what the basic arc is going to be pretty early on, although some of the techniques they use to get from one point to another are quite surprising, even though genre savvy already told you where the story was going. In short, the overarching plot is obvious, but the specifics can be interesting. Another issue is that they clearly don't understand science. Some of it is excusable, since they are working with a futuristic world with technology far ahead of ours, but there are some points where they bring in concepts that we understand pretty well and they get them wrong. Which can be distracting. A more minor issue is that there's some rather crude and problematic humour in one episode. Since it's limited to that one episode, it's not a huge problem though. That being said, there are plenty of aspects that the anime handles well. The world they build is compelling. They handle the \"Fish out of Water\" element exceedingly well. The ending, though kind of rushed, is well handled overall. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this are great. They react to things like real people would and develop pretty naturally over the course of the series. Their motivations and actions make perfect sense based on their backgrounds. When you find out something about a character's personal history it serves to help you understand why they are the way they are, which indicates that the personal histories were either planned ahead of time or very well thought out. Even the more minor characters have a sense of verisimilitude. The only weakness when it comes to characters are the ultimate antagonists. I won't spoil it, but the explanation behind their actions is pretty flimsy. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this is really good. The action sequences are appropriately chaotic while being easy to follow. The backgrounds can be downright breathtaking, they're so well designed and animated. The character designs are good. The various fauna are really well detailed. I only have one complaint about the art, those of you who read my reviews consistently can probably guess what it is, the Fan-service. There's a belly dancing scene that serves absolutely no purpose and there are some other moments where the angle or the costuming in general, is done for the sole purpose of providing fan-service. It's kind of annoying. And, frankly, the major female characters are too young to be shown in an objectified fashion. In all fairness, most of the costumes do make sense for the scenario. There are just a few cases where they make an exception. \\n\\n\r\nThe vocal cast in this is exceptional. I haven't heard Ishikawa Kaito in anything else, but he gives a really good performance. Kanemoto Hisako and Fujimura Ayumi are also really good. But the best performance has to be from Sugita Tomokazu. He is amazing in this. Certainly at the best I've ever heard him and I've heard him in quite a few roles. Including, but not limited to, Suzumiya Haruhi's Kyon, Chobits' Hideki and Nanoha's Chrono. The music is also really well done and really serves to enhance the action. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 3/10. Rackage is heavily implied to have yuri girl followers, although she does very little with them, and there are some scenes where Amy and her friends get really touchy. Scenes like this, however, are infrequent and ultimately don't amount to much. \\n\\n\r\nIt looks like I won't have to take up drinking after all. Suisei no Gargantia is a good anime. It has some rather substantial flaws, but nothing so bad that it should affect your enjoyment too much. My final rating is a solid 7/10.",

            "content": "Urobutchi Gen is an extremely divisive creator, that is nothing new.  Urobutcher happens to flourish in the age of the moe boom.  Over 70% of anime each season involves high school, club, imouto or some variation of a pandering orgy, Butcher\u2019s butchings were definitely minty treats for twisted buzzards like me.  However, just as moe cheapens itself by turning up at every facets of the Anime industry, Gen\u2019s sadistic tendencies also begin to get tired.  By the time Psycho Pass was conceived, there were cries of predictability.\r\nMany believe that Gargantia was somewhat a failure, and some of them even called it\u201cUrobuchi\u2019s worst to date.\u201d I will assert that Gargantia of the Verdurous Planet was more like a minor success.\\n\\n\r\nOne may argue that Psycho Pass builds upon a very uninspired dystopian theme, a utopian-wannabe surveillance society.  That was so over ten years ago.  Gargantia seemed to head down the same path.  It started out with a rather cliched scenario: child soldier who knows nothing but war, becomes stranded with a peaceful society.  Subsequently cues character development and all sort of cheesy stuffs about war is bad, humanity is cruel and deep stuffs happen.  However, what is unique about Gargantia that made it worked (at first) is the very nice contrasts between the characters and also thanks to the initial superb directing.  Ever pondered why 90% of anime protagonists are third-year high school students?  Because they are shows aimed towards wish-fulfillment for the primary demographic.  In Gargantia, Ledo\u2019s teenage age is fitting in capturing his impressionable innocence.  Amy, the primary supporting protagonist, also belongs in the age group.  She serves as the foil of Ledo.  Her character, in every way, acts like your typical uninspired genki anime girl.  But that is the very beauty of characterization!  Her adowableness serves as the foil for Ledo\u2019s uptight military formality. Amy\u2019s archetype is the way normal teenagers usually act.  It would not have worked anywhere near as well if Ledo was some old coarse-voiced disillusioned old man.  It was a simple touch, not particularly clever, but brilliant regardless!  Urobuchi\u2019s characters are being more than just dull for once?  I am not certain if it is an actual improvement, or if it was because there were other scriptwriters taking the helm each episode.  I will give him the benefit of the doubt.\\n\\n\r\nThe first four episodes were superb, the best part of the series.  I daresay that those were one of the strongest opening episodes I have ever seen and they went a long way in humanizing Ledo as a character.  Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet could have become something greater.  Unfortunately, that did not last.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 5 aired, and the show took a huge dip. It introduced a plethora of issues to the writing, as well as being the worst episode in the show.  A beach episode in a show that so far had been rather solemn and sincere.  This turn of events ruined the tone, pacing and consistency for the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing the turning point, the subsequent episodes consist of more world-building.  I would have been fine if the world-building actually conveys some meaning, but it was inconsequential.  Despite a nice set-up from the first four episodes, there were no real conflicts until episode 8.  I eventually ran out of patience for the show due to its incoherent plot.  Consequently, a lot of fans started to jump ship (sorry).  Even after the big twist, everything was underwhelming and unmemorable.  The conflicts introduced are messy and didn\u2019t really follow through, especially anything that involves the whalesquid/Hadiauze.\\n\\n\r\nThe finale was actually quite decent, but by that point I just didn\u2019t care anymore.\\n\\n\r\nThe most lamentable issues lie in the characters.  Everyone besides Ledo and Chamber eventually suffers from extremely shallow characterization, typical of Urobuchi Gen.  Amy started out great, but became an progressively flatter (yes, her chest too). She just becomes this background character who cries for Ledo every now and then, not the assertive girl who actively befriended him at the start of the series.  After the series\u2019 run, Amy was reduced to a pointless romantic subplot.  Her dynamic with Ledo became stale and stereotypical of anime high school romance.  The antagonists are rather silly.  The inconsistency of their actions were jarring.  They felt somewhat similar to the villains in Sword Art Online.  They were cheesy, shallow, and do not actually seem threatening, just stupid.  There are also good characters that have been left mostly untouched who would have greatly contributed to the story such as Bebel, Dr. Oldham, and Bellows.  Wasted potentials!\\n\\n\r\nLedo\u2019s growth as a character was the most enjoyable part about Gargantia.  I can almost compare his growth to that of Waver from Fate/Zero.  His kindness is pure innocence and self-awareness, rather than a bland self-insert that plagues every other anime nowadays.  He possessed a childish obsession over Amy\u2019s well-being.  He wants to protect her not simply because he is a generic nice person, but because Amy is his first treasured companion.  His love for her was subtle, and non-sensual.  Ledo\u2019s romantic interest in Amy is depicted not as between a man and a woman, but bears more resemblance of a family love.  His conversations with Babel were very nice touches that serve to make the family motif evident.\\n\\n\r\nChamber is my favorite character in the show.  He is the ultimate bro!  Well, probably inferior to Rider, but still a bro!  Throughout the course of 13 episodes, he is always the voice of the reason and at the same time, a snarky sidekick who is comically serious.  Urobuchi has always been terrible at exposition, and his dialogues tend to be on the boring heavy-handed side.  This time around however, Chambro was perfect for info-dumping and conveying the theme to the audience.  Gargantia is seen through Ledo\u2019s and Chambro\u2019s perspectives.  Ledo ponders about his surrounding, and Chambro forms his conjectures about the world.  Everything flows together smoothly and more naturally, as opposed to being obligatory and obviously shoed in.  It is definitely more engaging than listening to pretentious dudes quoting famous literature while preaching about Sibyl.  The best aspect of it all, or maybe rather sad, is that Chambro felt more human than everyone else, bars Ledo.  He was able to develop a certain degree of empathy, sentience and free-will in a much more believable way compared to Yui from SAO.  Through a series of accumulated data, he came to his own conclusion, overcoming the restrictive protocols of the Galactic Alliance.  If everything else sucked about this show, Chamber is extremely well-written to somewhat compensate.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is Gargantia a relative success regardless of its various blunders?  Despite it being a very safe show that take little risks, Urobuchi Gen finally deviates from his standard fare and tries out something different.  That is a healthy mindset to have, something the industry definitely needs more.  Unlike his other works, Gargantia is the most optimistic of all.  Its light-heartedness just ring more true to me as a futuristic slice-of-life than anything else.  In that respect, Gargantia is a pretty respectable slice-of-life.",

            "content": "An epic anime with a tremendous misplaced potential. Produced by studio Production IG, one of the most promising anime-studio there is, plus made by the renowned Gen Urobuchi, who's notable for his works: Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Psycho Pass, and Fate/Zero---well, meet their cousin: Suisei no Gargantia (Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet). The stage is set for one of the most misplaced potential anime there is.\r\nJust by looking at these titles: Madoka Magica, Psycho Pass, and Fate/Zero, the veil of darkness is wrapped on these (in)famous anime, yet Gargantia took the opposite take; it's lighter and less casualty-oriented, among other themes that you would notreally expect from Urobuchi-san.\\n\\n\r\nStill, after finishing the 13-episodes + 2 OVAs, I dare say this anime is on the same level as the other works I've mentioned here, just that it has the \"misplaced potential\" on its stead.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY = 8\\n\r\nAt first, I was certain that the Gundam Series are the only legit mecha-anime that could pull these kind of story themes, wtih Gurren Lagann, and the original Aquarion (the original one, okay~ the \"Evol\" evolved into ecchi) being able to do just as unforgettable. Gargantia also rivaled those titles with its light-to-dark story, mecha-involved 13-episode (+2 OVA).\\n\\n\r\nART = 9\\n\r\nFluid, great anime, something you expect much from Production IG. They made Psycho Pass after all, that anime led me to notice what \"Production IG\" can do. With Gargantia, it met up with my expectations art-wise.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND = 9\\n\r\nA-ok songs, background music, and most notably, the seiyuu cast.\\n\r\nA \"slight error\" by my source (aka. friend) told me that Kanae Itou is the one voicing Amy, but when I first heard her voice, without checking it here in MAL, I straight away know its Ika Musume's seiyuu: Hisako Kanemoto. She did a great job alright. Ishikawa Kaito as the voice of Ledo, I kept it particular and acute that he was able to be convincing in \"breaking\" his Japanese fit for Ledo who has a hard time blending with his language against the people in Gargantia.\\n\r\nTomokazu Sugita as the voice of Chamber: to say Gintoki and Kyon's voice being able to sound like an AI, these talents of these seiyuus deserve a 10 really---the 9 was intended for the other parameters of this category (like the BGM).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER = 10\\n\r\nIf I could rate this as 20, 20 it is. This is an anime that transcend to the usual \"character types\". Here, the character types doesn't necessarily apply being protagonist or antagonist. Urobuchi-san clearly demonstrates what he can do with characterization after making spellbinding anime. I first salute to \"Rinne no Lagrange\" for breaking the usual protagonist/antagonist archetype, and Gargantia did just as good--with less cliche even.\\n\r\nCharacterization here clearly demonstrates the 3D parameters; one that you don't see the \"protagonist\" being the main cast and main seiyuu, but the antagonist also has the same weigh and reason of the protagonists' existence.\\n\r\nWe're talking of out-of-the-book characterization here after all, and not something like Power Rangers where we know exactly who's the protagonist/antagonist the first thing we saw 'em.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT = 9\\n\r\nFrom the story, to characters, it's all enjoyable. Reviews here in MAL states that it has a \"slow\" start, but then again we all know the drill of this by now: Madoka Magica, Gurren Lagann, Kill la Kill, Gundam Seed, Steins;Gate, AnoHana, etc, every epic unforgettable anime there is has a \"s;ow\" start.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL = 9\\n\\n\r\nIF James Cameron has a kind of plot or theme like this, and incorporated it to Avatar, or perhaps made \"Avatar 2\" with this kind of theme---then we might forget he directed and wrote the script for Titanic.\\n\\n\r\nBorrowing the elements of mecha or not, Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet is a solid, ground-breaking anime with three-dimension-characters and nihilistic themes in color rather than in dark---and HENCE the recipe for misplaced potential.\\n\\n\r\nMisplaced Potential--why? Because an anime or a story like this is NOT intended for \"anime fans\". The slow-pacing, the more dramatic, three-dimensional characterization, and themes that conflicts the essence of humanity needs an appreciation that does not NEED to borrow the essence of either \"wicked\" or \"dark\" enough, and does not need to be filled with fight-scenes and effects JUST for anime-fans to appreciate it.\\n\\n\r\nSure, the term \"anime fan\" leaves a bad taste in the mouth; but since 2008 this is what I kept on observing. Why I'll slam this context in this review is all because of my observations. Like take it like this: a deep story with light-elements like Gargantia and you get a MAL rating of 7.78.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, getting a high rating is as easy as enticing anime-fans by simply throwing ecchi anime and various fanservice, and you'll never go wrong to say that the MAL rating received on those kind of ecchi goes a rating of 8 and above.\\n\\n\r\nStill, not every anime-fan is ecchi-hungry and \"needs to be amused\"; there are those who sits intensively on shows like Steins;Gate and PsychoPass. \\n\r\nSo for \"Gargantia on Verdurous Planet\", try to see if you're the kind of fan who watches for the plot, or the kind who watches for the fanservice and being amused; as this is pretty much intended to the former as it holds a promise of a \"misplaced potential\" great anime.",

            "content": "It is a common belief in fiction that the bigger and more explosive a story is, the better it becomes. \r\nIn the case of \"Suisei no Gargantia\", bigger is anything but better. What makes the first half of the anime so special, and so rewarding, is made irrelevant by the bloated mess that follows. And it's a shame- it had the potential to be one of the best anime of these past few years.\r\nDespite being the latest work of the (in)famous Urobuchi Gen, Suisei no Gargantia depicts a much more down-to-earth story. There is no ruthless slaughtering of the characters (though some might deserve itat times), nor are there any plot twists until the last few episodes. Suisei no Gargantia is set in a distant future where the Earth has been flooded. And flooded entirely. What remains of human civilization live their days in fleets of antiquated ships, free from any worry but the rare threat of pirates. \\n\\n\r\nEnter \"Ledo\", a teenage soldier from across the galaxy who somehow, conveniently enters a wormhole that drops him to the birthplace of humanity-- Earth. \\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting aspect of the series is how Ledo copes with (and eventually accepts) a society so distinctly different from his own. Where Ledo comes from, concepts such as peace do not exist. Humans are born and raised for the sole purpose of fighting their enemy, the Hideaze. And naturally there is no such thing as love or friendship.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat follows is a series of amusing, sometimes uncomfortable scenes of Ledo experiencing culture shock. What the heck is the purpose of money? ... to buy more weapons to shoot dudes with? He has no idea. Whenever he experiences something new, he and his AI companion (\"Chambers\") will inevitably draw some ridiculous contrast to their own society. In one scene, Ledo even asks the person beside him why an injured child is alive. I felt very bad for laughing at that. \\n\\n\r\nLedo also experiences a rapid period of growth as he becomes closer with the inhabitants of the Gargantia fleet. He learns to enjoy life, how to do ordinary things such as swimming or cooking, and what friendship means. He transforms from a cold, ruthless soldier into a normal human being, one that can feel emotion and remorse. The Ledo at the start of the story is not the Ledo at the end of the story, and this character development is something that deserves no shortage of praise. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, there's also everything else about the story.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed the relaxed and carefree nature of the first half, prepare to have everything you liked about the show flipped upside down in the second half. The character development slows to a crawl. The comedy becomes nonexistent. What is hammered in its place is a joyless disaster, devoid of anything even remotely interesting. \\n\\n\r\nWhere to begin? I suppose the moronic characterization would be a start. While the first half showed signs of the side characters breaking away from their stereotype, the second half seeks instead to bury them in that shell. The only character aside from Ledo who even receives any notable growth is Pinion, but his backstory is so contrived and heavy-handed that there's little reason to care about his suffering. \\n\\n\r\nEven worse are the minor characters who populate the Gargantia fleet. They are insufferably stupid. There is one scene where Ledo is reprimanded by the fleet's commanders for protecting them from a pirate attack, which would have inevitably led to looting and violence. Are you kidding me? \\n\\n\r\nIt makes one wonder why this screen time wasn't handed to Amy instead. Aside from Ledo, she is the only character in the show with sense in her brain. She is the one who changed Ledo, who taught him that life is worth living, and yet she is merely relegated to the role of a cheer leader by the end. She deserved much more than that. \\n\\n\r\nSure, Ledo is plenty developed, but he is just as much a victim as anybody else. The change that the first half had building for him is simply used as a tool to force in cheesy dialogue about the power of friendship. During the climax, he changes his mind over an important decision simply because Amy came flying by on a kite to yell at him. Can I puke now? \\n\\n\r\nThis would be bad enough on its own, but the plot itself fares no better. Plot twists and ridiculous contrivances are the name of the game. Everything is somehow tied to Ledo and his own people, and the 'twists' (especially regarding the antagonist) are so cliched that they almost feel as if the writer was playing a joke. And then there's not even a proper ending to wrap all of this mess up! It ends abruptly with little to no context, begging you to follow through with the sequel OVA for answers. There is absolutely no reason why the audience should have to watch a sequel in order to have a proper conclusion to a story that they already invested their time in. That is silly. \\n\\n\r\nOn a more positive note, the artwork is generally decent. The characters are modeled consistently while the oceans are rendered with grandeur, effectively making the post-apocalyptic Earth seem more like a paradise. However, the quality plummets in the 11th episode, where entire scenes have crowds of characters drawn as blobs. Literal blobs. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also one of the better points of the anime. There's nothing here that will stay in your mind for eternity (though the ending song is sure as heck relaxing), but each of the lighthearted tracks do a solid job of conveying the feelings of relaxation and hope which pervade the first half. It's an atmospheric anime when it tries to be, which makes the second half all the more lamentable. \\n\\n\r\nSuisei no Gargantia is an anime with an identity crisis. Is it a dramatic story about the dark secrets of humanity, or is it simply a lighthearted tale about a young man finding his place in life? Who really knows. I don't think it does either.\\n\\n\r\nIt didn't have to turn out this way.",

            "content": "A utopia. \r\nHow many people have ever dreamed about our world ever becoming one? It's an idea that stretches beyond dreams and imaginations. In such a world, there would be peace, paradise, and colonies where humanity can settle down and enjoy their lives. Well, those are just all dreams of course. People may fill their heads with these ideas but for the Human Galactic Alliance, it's one that they hope to fulfill for many years. Then, there's one young boy among all of this and his name is Ledo. After a certain event, he gets swallowed up into a distortion of time and space whilefinding himself on a new place. It's Earth, a planet of life and prosperity.\\n\\n\r\nSuisei no Gargantina (also known as Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet) is an original animated series that fuses the genres of action, drama, science fiction, and mecha into a single package. The famous Gen Urobuchi is involved in the series as both for the script and composition. Based on his various style of  writing in his previous works (Psycho Pass, Madoka), this series takes a different direction. It takes the form of a more style of world building constructed by our characters, settings, and themes that sets off this science fiction series.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the series takes place in the distant future. Thus, its technologies and settings are far beyond our modern times by standards. A clear example is our main male protagonist Ledo and his sidekick Chamber. He is a AI-automated, humanoid-shaped battle suit with a catchy tone of voice to go along with it. More importantly though, he is Ledo's partner as well as a weapon of war. Chamber fits within the style of science fiction by the way of his stature and its mechanization. With powerful technology, we can see that Chamber is something out of the ordinary. Then of course, there's Ledo. He is a 16 year old young male who is recognized as a Galactic Alliance lieutenant. After engaging battles against the mysterious tentacled alien beings known as the \u201cHideauze\u201d, he gets stranded to another planet. It's a verdurous planet where the Gargantians live and prosper. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, there's all kind of new excitement waiting for our friend Ledo.\\n\\n\r\nThat brings forth the Gargantinans who have peacefully settled on the planet. As we can see, the planet itself is covered with water. Thus, people are forced to live on enormous ships in order to survive. Through unity and cooperation, colonies have been established and attempts are made to settle down peacefully. Unfortunately, that's not always the case. Beyond just the mysterious Hideauze species, there are also pirates. In fact, one of the earlier episodes shows a pirate fleet directly engaging in combat against the Gargantinans. These people seems to be a bit different than normal humans. Although on the outside, they look almost just like normal humans, they have different standards. Through comparisons, the Gargantinans functions differently by the way they don't murder senselessly. They also seem to enjoy life to their fullest and often tries to endlessly protect it no matter what the cause. Going back though, it's clear that these beings value lives truly. For example, they treat the handicapped with respect and also protect creatures whom are considered \u201csacred\u201d under their eyes. However at the same time, there seems to exist some problems between them and other colonies. These problems on such a utopia gives a different outlook on the world that is considered Earth with such a paradise.\\n\\n\r\nBeing the new guy on a whole new planet, Ledo is the talk among the crew members. Among these members include Amy, a girl who literally becomes Ledo's hostage from the beginning. She is a young girl with about the same age as Ledo. At first, they get off to a rocky start because of the circumstances. However, it is clear that Amy cares about Ledo as she is perhaps the only person who gets closest to him. Through interactions, Amy serves as both a guide and friend to Ledo. Even from the beginning, she is fearless towards him and offers assistance in learning about the world. (with a taste of a bitty treat if I might add) Over time, it's also clear that Amy wants Ledo to adjust to his new environment. In many ways, Amy serves as someone who can navigate Ledo's character through her guidance. By teaching him the standards of a human and adjusting them, Ledo seems to become softer and more humane as before. This is most prominent as Ledo is taught about the philosophy of \u201cthink before killing\u201d. The philosophy seems to confuse Ledo at first because the way he grew up assumingly. At many variances, Ledo questions about the laws of human nature and what's right or wrong. However, there is an unique bond between the two that I find to be natural and interactive. It is through interactions with Amy that Ledo now has a more value to where he belongs. It seems that there's a case of Ledo desiring to protect Amy and his newfound home. His morality is built based on the moments they share and although they seem to be simple, it is important for his character from my perspective.\\n\\n\r\nAmong other characters as well is Chamber, the ever so flashy robot who serves as a tool and sidekick (not to mention translator) for Ledo. His origins are a bit mysterious by his manner of speech but even more so with his structure. The machine seems to also serve as a guide for Ledo on the planet and at the same time, a weapon of war. It is equipped with a devastating offensive weapon (a disintegrator ray of sorts) as well as agility to maneuver itself against adversaries. Other characters in the series such as Bellows, Pinion, and Amy's friends also make their flashy highlights whether it's to serve as progressing Ledo's character or just giving him some time of fun.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of fun, the series does push that mood a bit especially later on. It comes in all shapes and sizes too with some fan service swimwear. To further this element, Ledo himself becomes Mr. Fan service and the girls just seems to love him for that. It doesn't stop there either as it pushes the dance scenes along with the mood coupled with the panty shots and up-skirts. At the same time, it pokes fun of the language in the series that can be portrayed as both scientific and at times, comedy. To further this out a bit, the series also has that lighthearted mood with its slow pacing.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this though, the series still retains its serious mood at many times. Ledo's progressing in character seems more evident the more time he spent with others, in particular Amy. In fact, he even learns how to express gratitude to others in the form of a simple \u201cThank You\u201d. He also learns about some of the food and how they came to be on the planet. Unfortunately, Ledo does not seem to forget about his primary objective and this earns him some criticism from others. If you guessed something related to 'killing', then you're right. Ledo's personal philosophy still seems to stick hard in his head. Only this time, he seems to have something worth fighting for. However, the guy isn't exactly a pacifist. \\n\\n\r\nAmong other factors, I find this series also a little bit mysterious. This is especially evident in the beginning involving the Hideauze as they are described by Ledo as his ultimate antagonist and executioners of the world. Then, there's the planet Earth itself as well as the Gargantinans. How did they survive all these years? What happened to the planet that caused all the flooding? Why are certain creatures on the planet so sacred? These are perhaps many questions that pops up into a viewers mind as they are watching this series. Needless to say, it makes this show worth watching for its assumed origins and how fans perceive them as each episode progresses.\\n\\n\r\nThe action of this series is spectacular but at times seems a bit out of space. The way that Ledo engages in combat from the beginning is presented visually as exciting. At the same time, we can also see that Ledo is a bit too good at what he does especially against some pirates later on. Watching a somewhat overpowered MC loses somewhat of a balance. Furthermore, his actions results in anger from the people of the planet. He just doesn't understand the laws of human nature. For Ledo, humanity is something that may take him a very long time to understand. \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals in this series is outstanding. It is beautiful enough that the series must be watched in 720P or higher or it might lose the experience of this show. The reason lies in the magnificent battle in the beginning. Then, it's the planet that Ledo landed on. The planet's ocean is given strong scenery to give an impression of a world of water. The characters' designs also gives a feeling of an utopia. Though some of them may be dressed with more fan service material than others, it sets the mood right with its theme. It shows that the series has that feeling of science fiction. Ledo himself also seems to stand out with the way he dresses and those noticeable hair and eyes. Among other things, the architectures and vessels on the planet are designed to be aquatic along with the creatures themselves. Needless to say, this series is a visually presented with extraordinaire. With the talented Hirotsugu Kakoi (Mirai Nikki, Blue Exorcist) in charge, I find this series to be quite something in terms of visual artwork. That something is obviously worth the praise.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the soundtrack of this show seems to strike me also as powerful.Taro Iwashiro is in charge of the background OST and I find it to fitting. It balances between smooth to intense at occasions but nothing too earth shattering. It does match with some scenes though. At the same time, there are two pieces of songs performed by Minori Chihara (the Opening song) and ChouCho (the Ending song). They have their style but the visuals seems to overshadow the soundtrack here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series was a very pleasant experience for me. Although it takes a different approach of how Gen Urobuchi's other works, it's an unique approach to the science fiction genre. At some instances, it might seem like a slice of life story. However, the experiences the characters goes through is much more than that. It challenges them the aspect of life, especially for Ledo in terms of his standards and morality. As a soldier of an alliance, his certain circumstances becomes something completely different than what he was used to. It's insightful to watch how he adjusts to them. Through world building along with the cultural differences, the viewers can see how Ledo explores his new found situation on the planet. Perhaps it does flow a bit slow than what some fans may expect out of a science fiction show. However, that flow from my perpective is one that is a fun ride to experience. Yup, I got a nice experience watching Suisei no Gargantia. \\n\\n\r\nNow, it's your turn.",

            "content": "After seeing episode nine of this series I feel compelled to write a review about it.\r\nSuisei no Gargantia is by far the best anime of the season, even better than Shingeki no Kyojin and I am really hoping that they renew it for a second season (because I feel they will need more episodes to develop the plot. \r\nEssentially if you have followed the series so far you know that Ledo (the main character) is a solider in the Galactic Alliance which has been in a non stop war with the Hideauze for as long as anyone can remember. Ledo like his solider counterparts werebred to be soldiers, go through massive amounts of psychological altering, and ultimately are trained to hate the Hideauze with all of their being as a human. This is evidenced by Chambers continual Sleep preservation training, and his instinctual will to kill the Hideauze on sight. \\n\\n\r\nWhen you watch this series you follow essentially the humanization of ledo as a character, from a human Hideauze killing machine to a being that thinks on his own, and it so far has been wonderful. \\n\\n\r\nNow to break this down into parts.\\n\\n\r\nStory & Characters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen Ledo and Chamber first arrive on earth after the result of being lost in a wormhole, they are essentially helpless. Clueless to where they are after being in a state of cryo-stasis for 6 months, they awake to humans trying to pry Chamber open. This is where you get to meet the rest of the major characters in the series and Ledo begins living life in his own way. As the episodes progress you get to meet Amy, Ridget, Pinion, Bellows and the rest of the cast, and you see how they affect Ledo's almost machine like mentality and slowly turn him into a human being. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis by far has top quality animation and sound like Shingeki no Kyojin, except with a much more vivid color palette. As many other reviewers have noted, though Shingeki may be the most original story based anime to watch this season, Suisei is the one you choose to watch for the animation. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment Factor 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI've been trying real hard to not give away too many spoilers about the anime or write a word for word plot synopsis, but this anime has it all. The story so far is killer, the animation is great, and you can just tell it was a well thought out anime. To me, it feels like an original story for an anime. I won't say that at this point I haven't seen the story in a video game, because I honestly have, but for an anime it is quite original. \\n\\n\r\nSo go on, watch it. I don't think you will be disappointed.",

            "content": "Suisei no Gargantia (or Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet) is a show that starts off with plenty of promise. It had famed writer Gen Urobuchi venturing outside the grimness of his previous work to make a more uplifting story, beautiful visuals from Production I.G., and a great premise. It explored thought-provoking concepts while remaining fun and affirming; possessing an optimism and faith in humanity that was simply infectious. However, while the first half of the show flows with a comfortably and naturally (albeit with some wasted time), the second half is clunky and forceful in introducing darker elements to the plot. The end is stilla decent and interesting show, but it doesn't quite live up to expectation.\\n\\n\r\nThe set-up for the show is great. Due to some great catastrophe, most humans have left Earth and are now engaged in a constant battle for survival against bizarre monstrosities called Hideauze, becoming a militaristic society called the Galactic Alliance of Humankind. Our hero Ledo is a young man who was born into this endless war, knowing nothing but battle. Due to an accident he is transported far away from this conflict, to a water covered planet; the Earth which humankind had left so long ago. He comes across the (mostly) peaceful boat-dwelling indigenous people living in a fleet named Gargantia, and has to adapt to their drastically different culture in order to survive in this unfamiliar world. This set-up works for so many reasons. It allows the show's world to open up as Ledo learns more about his new surroundings; its culture and its people. It provides contrast between Ledo's militaristic way of life and the more laid-back way of life on Gargantia. Most importantly, it gives Ledo a lot of potential for development as he grows accustom to the ways of Gargania, and makes personal connections with its people.\\n\\n\r\nLedo is by far the most developed character in the show, as it should be because the story hinges on his growth. He starts off as hard-edged, serious young man lacking in personality and understanding of the nuances of human interaction; which is no fault of his own, of course. Despite not understanding of the world he landed in, he knows that he must adapt to his surroundings, which of course includes adjusting to Gargatnia's society and finding his place in it. Completely foreign to him are many of Gargantia's core values: co-existence, caring for the deficient, and using violence as a last resort. The lax organization of the fleet and laid-back way of life seem inefficient to him. However, as he continues to meet and interact with the residents of Gargantia, he begins to understand and appreciate their way of life. This leads to an inner conflict between the ideas that have been instilled in him at a young age, and these new feelings he is developing; which comes to a head when he finds creatures living beneath the water that are genetically identical to the Hideauze. Ledo's development throughout the show is the driving factor on the show, and seeing him change and loosen up is the greatest satisfaction of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast don't have anywhere near the amount of development Ledo has; really do feel secondary. The exception is Ledo's battle mech and support unit, Chamber. Despite not being human, Chamber has a surprising amount of charm; his (Chamber has a male voice) duty to serve and protect Ledo actually grants him some personality. Though his A.I. gives him great analytical ability, being a robot Chamber doesn't really understand human interaction, which is often used for some good laughs. Amy is the spunky girl who volunteers to be Ledo's guide in Gargantia; she's the catalyst to much of Ledo's changes, and his love interest later in the show. She doesn't develop much beyond her feelings for Ledo, but she is a ray of sunshine and a good foil for our stoic lead. Her disabled younger brother Bevel also has a profound, if limited, effect on the show. Through his conversations with Bevel, Ledo learns the value that every person, even someone who is disabled, brings. Most of the other characters are less remarkable; they do get some development, but not enough to make them really memorable. Which is a shame because the show could have done something interesting with many of these characters, but ultimately focuses on them only enough for them to be plot devices. Some of the their actions later in the story feel like they happened for plot convenience, rather than something the characters would do.\\n\\n\r\nThe world of Gargaintia is rich in detail and well developed through the early stages of the show. The show begins with a detailed introduction to the Galactic Alliance of Humankind, a bit of its history and social structure, and it isn't even where the main story takes place. When Ledo lands on Earth, it opens up a new world to explore. The show does a good job of depicting first contact between two unfamiliar cultures. Along with the difference of environment and culture, Ledo doesn't even speak the same language as the people of Gargantia. It takes him some time to learn their language; he has to rely on Chamber to decipher and translate for him regularly at first. This really adds to the show's immersion; as a viewer, it feels like you are discovering a new world alongside Ledo. Details of Gargaintia's society and Earth's ecosystem are introduced gradually through situations, rather than just being explained in information dumps. Not to say it always uses its time effectively, episode 5 is a completely unnecessary  fan-service episode that is also the low point in the show's writing, and there are moments which are a bit too quaint every once in a while. Still, all in all, it is a very good approach, building the settings in a very natural way.\\n\\n\r\nThe show loses this quality in the darker later half, which delves into why and how humans left Earth to begin with. After certain events cause tension, Ledo parts ways with Gargantia for a while. This leads to him finding footage chronicling the events before a large populous fled to space. It is interesting, showing that the people of Earth were far from united even in the face of impending disaster, with two factions waging war on each other. However, it is also a huge info dump that feels out of place. It goes on about disagreements of what actions should be taken for mankind's survival, and arguments of ethics concerning genetic modification; as well as the origins of the Galactic Alliance, and the creation of the Hideauze. It is too much information at one time, and is quite jarring, honestly. The pacing also is jarringly different, with majority of the big plot twists taking place in the latter half; the show goes from pacing itself leisurely to being very busy. Because of this, a lot of characters' development is rushed, and there isn't really any closure or catharsis for any characters the show takes time to develop, with the exception of Ledo and Chamber.\\n\\n\r\nNot to say these plot twists are bad. They invoke some interesting ideas about the system a group of people live under and how it can become harmful when it is so rigid that it becomes constrictive; as it has in the Galactic Alliance of Humanity and the cult that is introduced late in the series. Human society needs a system to function, but when that system becomes all encompassing that it determines how everyone living under it thinks, it becomes an oppressive force. This is a theme Urobuchi seems endlessly fascinated with, having explored similar ideas in his past work. The thing is, Gargantia somewhat oversimplifies these ideas by doing too much to vilify the system at work without really going into why such a system might be necessary. The cult introduced near the finale is so brainwashed that it is obvious that the show is skewed against their way of live. It's admirable that the show believes so strongly in a simpler and more loosely constructed way of life, but it is optimistic to the point of naivety in its view. Luckily, Ledo's revaluation of his life gives the show's values enough weight to still be honest and meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the visuals go, the show looks incredible as would be expected from Production I.G. Right from the beginning, the visuals impress with a stunning space battle that is cold and mechanical, but amazing to behold nonetheless. In contrast, the never-ending ocean of Earth and city-like fleet of Gargantia are brimming with liveliness. There is a naturalistic beauty to the settings: the clear blue sky and the shimmering water below that goes well beyond the horizon, the underwater ecosystems, the light of the glowfish at night; it is all breathtaking to look at. Gargantia itself is quite a sight, equal parts fantastical and makeshift. The boat-dwelling people of Gargantia have a rudimentary grasp on technology compared their ancestors, but resourceful and learned to live with what little lost technology they can scavenge and whatever nature provides them; it is easy to see this by just looking at the place where they live. The character designs by Hanaharu Naruko are diverse, colorful, and lively. Clear emphasis is put on female characters (the show loves to flaunt their bodies), but the guys are also quite distinctive; something that is fairly rare in anime. Of special note is the tan Ledo develops during his time on Earth, which is a nice subtle touch.\\n\\n\r\nThe music by Taro Iwashiro is mostly composed of orchestral pieces. It is nothing innovative, but it is very well composed and most certainly effective. The music is broad and versatile, which is for the best because Gargantia has a wide range of tones. The compositions support the calm quite moments and warm touching moments just as effectively as tension filled arguments and battles. Probably the most impressive thing the music accomplishes is capturing a sense of wonder. After living on a confining military space colony all his life, the wind open Earth must be awe inspiring for Ledo; the music as well as the visuals imbues the show with a feeling of discovery and adventure.\\n\\n\r\nThough it is too naive to really be called a mature work, Suisei no Gargantia is certainly not a bad show. It is really quite enjoyable; it has likable characters, great art and animation, and a well developed lead. It's theme of how people in a community support one another is so good-natured that I feel kind of bad calling it out on its naivety. Still, the lack of development to the overall cast outside of being likable, and the simplifying of complex themes prevent it from being something great.  \\n",

            "content": "This review entails some  spoilers and, potentially, offensive regards to anime.\r\n^\r\n^\r\nSo. The two problems this anime faces are characterization and plot. The two key components of what make a good story. I'm just going to condense it down for ease and simplicity.\r\nGargantia had a lot of potential in the first few episodes. We're introduced to Ledo, a young man who lives among a space-colonized community of humans. However, all he and his fellow kin know is war against cephalopod(octopi, squids) aliens. Piloting highly advanced and durable AI, Ledo isn't accustomed to much outside of his mecha, \"Chamber\". As given by the summary, we prettymuch know the basics of everything else. When landing upon Earth, the very foundation of his life is put into question and he must battle his ruthless dogma with the mercy-based morality of the Earthen humans.\\n\\n\r\nNow, to just get straight to what I want to address, I'm going to talk characters and keep it as short and to-the-point as possible of me. Apologies for the poor construction ahead.\\n\\n\r\nLedo is, truthfully, one of the extremely few characters that was carrying this show, with Chamber being his only rival as such. Bevel and Oldham had their moments, but their screen-time was little and as such, isn't really much of a basis to go off from. Anyways, Ledo(as we see in the first episode) is very logical, analytic and precise, something that was likely learned from his constant interaction with a robot. He seeks constant guidance from Chamber and the two work together to figure out what they're dealing with, being aided by a girl named Amy. He is, however, open to change and thinks on a deeper level, attempting(constantly) to understand the ways of the people of Earth when they weren't doing the same in turn. There are some very good moments where Ledo expresses his horror, confusion and irritation toward truths of his mission and the mannerisms of his new commune. There are also terrible moments where his entire character is goofed up for the sake of a smile or small giggle.\\n\\n\r\nNow, Amy would have been a fine character... except for the fact that her friends and a portion of other characters nearly share the exact same archetype. Carefree, loved, sweet, and lively. There is very little depth to her, and she's your typical sweethearted heroine. Amy serves as a catalyst for Ledo's position in the society of Gargantia, and is a key component in his moral struggles, but that's pretty much it. There's very little exploration of who she is as a person and why she does what she does or why she is the way she is. Her only role in the anime is to be Ledo's guiding light, and she doesn't do a particularly fantastic job at it... unless just throwing him at people to talk to was her only purpose. Then she did great.\\n\\n\r\nPinion is a mess. The character initially hates Ledo with every fiber of his being and suddenly just becomes best bro's with the kid when seeing him, Ledo, down in the dumps over personal conflict. Pinion just randomly offers a hand to Ledo after continually trying to make the head of the ship get rid of him, and treats him like a brother very early on in the series. Again, there was no explanation for this change of character. It was like Pin was meant to be a rival and after a few episodes in, they just completely scrapped that idea. His history was passed over briefly and the character is pretty much an idiot and comedy relief. He has one or two truly mature moments in the entire thirteen episodes. A comic character isn't bad... but like I said, Pinion is a messy character. He is severely lacking in structure.\\n\\n\r\nChamber, on the other hand, is quite deep for being an artificial creation. As we expect, he's intelligent and can do all that cool robot-y stuff like scanning and predicting the future through complex analyzing to blowing crap up, but he himself has his inbuilt information challenged with knowledge learned throughout the show and ends up being more of a human than the human characters. And what I mean by that is he was given a developed personality... despite being a machine. Out of all the characters to choose from, they give the second most development of character to a hunk of freaking metal. I'm wont complain, anyways. At least they didn't give the entire mantle to a 16 year-old boy.\\n\\n\r\nBevel(an intelligent young boy) and Oldham(the only doctor of Gargantia?), like I said, didn't get much view time and had little spotlight. However, Bevel is very much a reason for Ledo's inner conflicts and Oldham is that \"wise old sage\" type that is suppose to balance out the immaturity of the rest of the cast, but can't because it's so overwhelming here with his sparse appearances. I'd try to be more explanatory, but it's difficult to do without giving spoilers. The few moments they appear are fairly important to Ledo, so you'd just have to watch for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nMiscellaneous characters. I'm not going to name them because I truthfully cannot even remember that much. There's a redheaded woman and another with black hair and glasses who leads the ship. Characters that seem to hold an important role, but are given no real depth and very little background. The pirate princess, who comes to their aid in the end of the series-- after being their enemy and a major threat to the lives just about everyone(the relationship was beneficial, but for whatever reason she comes to share a random friendship towards Pinion that has no development at all), is just a mess of a character again. Her intentions aren't remotely clear nor ever explained.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the plot... it's very weak and typical. This anime would have been far better off just exploring the psychological aspects of a child bred for war, taught \"survival of the strong\" ideals and merciless killing with having to question themselves against what it actually means to be human and what freedom of choice is. Ledo's growth as a character was good, but could have been phenomenal in the right hands. With the contrived plot and ending, this anime was just mistreated. The vast majority of the cast is shallowly written, every episode past seven is just an awkward clutter of poor development-- with few shining moments(all involving Ledo), and it's just another typical hurriedly-written anime that just can't deliver something more.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this for the average anime viewer because it's something that appeals to the masses. It's simple and very lighthearted, which to me, was a pitfall. Comedy isn't a bad thing, by any means, but anime anymore just focuses too much on goofy situations that don't have any sort of place in the story. Gargantia, unfortunately, is plagued by quite a bit of that.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a terrible show, but it's not amazing, either. If you're looking to waste a few hours, or a day, then this wouldn't be a bad anime to do that with. It's short and easy to understand.",

            "content": "I skipped over this series at first. Didn't know anything about it, and not being a particular fan of mecha anime I just assumed it wasn't going to be for me. Then I happened to decide to finally finish up Psycho-Pass which I had started not too long ago. That series was immensely satisfying for me and left me wanting more. Hopefully a second season of Psycho-Pass will eventually come... but in the mean time, I decided to see what else the writer had his name attached to and came back to this. I decided to shove my preconceptions aside and give it a watch.Now I can say that without a doubt, after Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero, Psycho-Pass and this curious little gem of a series I will follow this writer, Gen Urobuchi, wherever he next goes.\\n\\n\r\nSuisei no Gargantia is definitely an odd little series. I started off seriously unimpressed. Halfway into the first episode I was ready to turn it off. I was greeted by impenetrable space battles with flashy mechas piloted by characters who had given no reason to care about them. It felt exactly like the kind of thing I dread and lead me to believe Urobuchi had finally struck out. Sticking with it though, the second half of the episode stuck the hooks in deep and introduced an instantly likable female lead, a colorful, attractive band of characters and an interesting and imaginative world to explore. I soon realized the anime wasn't at all what I thought it was. What I saw instead was an immensely satisfying study of society and relationships with real heart on display, not another of the showy mecha fight series you can find just anywhere. \\n\\n\r\nThe series looks amazing. The art direction is superb and most of the shots look gorgeous. It's Production I.G., so maybe that goes without saying, but regardless it's a strikingly beautiful series. No complaints on how anything sounds either; the voice actors all do a good job and the music is usually pleasant and suitable. The character designs are very appealingly glossy and attractive. First rate stuff all around.\\n\\n\r\nI like the characters. The male lead is believable in his role, and though initially hard to identify with, becomes increasingly sympathetic as he opens up to the world around him. The female lead, Amy, is effortlessly likable; Urobuchi had proven to be really good with somewhat understated but resilient and spirited female leads, and she's no exception. The supporting cast is pretty good, I guess. I find myself liking them and the designs are great, but many of them aren't well developed at this point. The mecha itself is a kind of amusing character.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, Gargantia is immensely likable. Not as thought provoking as other Urobuchi works, or as  intense for that matter, but that's kind of the point I think. It's a show that rides on emotion. It's very much about feeling, and personally, I've thus far found it to be nothing but evocative.  An unexpected pleasure through and through.\\n\\n\r\nUpdate: Having now completed Gargantia, I feel the need to add a bit of an addendum to my initial review. Later in the series it shifts focus rather considerably; sacrificing a lot of the sentiment it conveyed so well through the first stretches of the series to try and be somewhat more thought provoking. Everything still works in my opinion and looking at it it's clearly the story Urobuchi was always going to tell here, but it is still somewhat disappointing. Amy, who is the crucial character in why the show works so well at first is shoved aside, only meriting a few appearances per episode in later episodes. It starts to feel a bit less earnest, and then it all concludes with a string of mecha action sequences that are only so satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nI would still say I admire this is a very well-made, and overall exceedingly enjoyable anime experience. It's very earnest and I commend Urobuchi for stepping away from his usual work somewhat, especially for the first half or so. Really it's easy to say that it might have been better if he had gone even further as Gargantia really does work it's best in the quieter, more understated slice of life moments. That said, while this show didn't do quite what I wanted it to, and for it it will miss the perfect ten score I've given to Urobuchi's other works, I still keep it at a nine and eagerly anticipate future projects from the writer.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nWatching Suisei no Gargantia is like watching someone who is completely incompetent play a good video game for an extended period of time. Is there anything more aggravating? They ignore obvious powerups right in front of their face, they never know what attack to use at what time, and they have absolutely no idea where they are going. As much as you desperately would like to take the reigns or at least guide them in the right direction, you simply can\u2019t. This process is universally frustrating and cringe-worthy because you know that if this person were only playing correctly, you would be ableto see the gameplay in all its glory. Instead, you end up sitting through hours of moronic lollygagging that goes utterly nowhere. To make a long story short, Gargantia is a comparably pointless and meandering ordeal despite the obvious potential for a heartwarming, meaningful, and even thought-provoking story that it at one point seemed destined to eventually arrive at.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: In the distant future, The Human Galactic Alliance has been constantly fighting for its survival against a race of beings called \"Hidiaazu.\" During an intense battle, a soldier named Ledo and his humanoid mecha \u201cChamber\u201d are sent spiraling through time and space. Several months later, Ledo wakes up from his artificially induced hibernation and realizes that he has arrived on planet Earth; the birthplace of humanity. The life he has known as an HGA soldier differs drastically from the culture he now finds here on Earth, as he struggles mightily to adjust to the new environment.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to give Gargantia credit for anything, I\u2019d praise the fact that\u2019s it\u2019s ambitious. It simultaneously aspires to be a thriller, a slice of life, a romance, a commentary on morality, and a mecha-action. Unfortunately, its own ambition coupled with some god awful writing resulted in an incomprehensible mess of plot holes, no direction what so ever, and so many irrelevant subplots that it becomes difficult to even comprehend what the show\u2019s primary narrative even is. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to be lured into Gargantia via its bright animation and intriguing first couple of episodes, but every good aspect it ever manages to establish goes to waste simply because it refuses to pick an identity at any point; this anime has NO idea what it wants to be. My first guess was that it was going to be a charming slice of life about a young man discovering what it really means to live, but then it decides to go on an incoherent, pointless, and shock-factor driven tangent that tries to introduce aspects of action, psychology, and suspense without an ounce of the narrative framework required to successfully do so. It\u2019s almost comical when you realize in hindsight how irrelevant and pointless this anime\u2019s little \u201cShyamalan Twist\u201d was to the main storyline. When the aspect of the narrative that\u2019s slated to carry the most emotional weight can be removed entirely without anything being different, something is wrong.  VERY wrong. But, surprisingly, one of the most nonsensical plot twists in anime history isn\u2019t even the biggest issue facing Gargantia\u2019s plot, because that title goes to the entire 2nd half of the anime, which is the most horrible, confused, and plothole laced 6-7 episodes I think I have ever seen. To sum all this up in a single sentence, Gargantia\u2019s plot is absolute garbage. This is far and away the worst thing that writer Gen Urobuchi has ever written or will ever write again, ESPECIALLY when you consider the characters:\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist, Ledo, is the only character in this show. That\u2019s right; you heard me. There are no other characters. LITERALLY everyone else in this show is a plot device. Amy, the female lead and love interest, is as 1-dimmensional as it gets. No personality, no motivations (partially because she barely does anything), no backstory, no nothing. She exists only so we can pretend that Ledo formed a bond with one of these boring sacks at some point. The closest thing this show ever gets to a character (besides Ledo) who exists for purposes other than advancing the plot IS A GODDAMN ROBOT. That\u2019s right; Chamber, Ledo\u2019s robot, is the closest thing to a side character that you are going to get. Notice the emphasis on the word \u201cclose\u201d, since Chamber is still an information-spewing plot device. The laughable way in which the show eventually tries to portray some sort of bond between Ledo and a robot makes the god-awful writing all the more cringe-worthy. Oh, and in case you didn\u2019t guess it already, Ledo is a bad character. They try to convince you at the end that he learned something and went through some kind of change but\u2026 When? It never feels like he\u2019s learning something nor does it ever feel like he\u2019s ever changing. Not to mention that his inconsistent reactions to events around him amplify the show\u2019s glaring plotholes. *Sigh... It\u2019s just really, REALLY bad writing for the complete lack of a better term. Putting it as bluntly as that is the best way I can think to sum it up.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Gargantia is not worth your time and it will only cause you immense disappointment if anything at all. One of my least favorite reviewer-clich\u00e9s is to go on and on about how \u201cThis anime had potential\u201d, because EVERY anime has potential; you aren\u2019t really saying anything with that. In this case, however, I really feel like this anime could have been special. If it had merely picked ONE out of the multiple great ideas it had and focused on it, this might have been one my favorites. Instead, it\u2019s shit. Storytelling is fickle, I suppose.",

            "content": "Terse, trite, and tried to do too much.\r\n*This review contains some spoilers for the show*\r\nSuisei no Gargantia was my anticipated show of the season; written by Urobuchi Gen [the mind behind novel renditions of derivative works such as Madoka Magica (to Faust), Psycho-Pass (to works such as BNW/1984), Saya no Uta (to Lovecraftian works), Kikokugai, and so forth], and animated by a studio adept with handling most subjects [Production I.G.]. I was looking forward to it; his works not only make the audience think, but they\u2019re often crafted intricately \u2014 excelling in both plot, characterization, and ultimately, presentation.\r\nBut the result? A mercurial series effusive withheroism, bad writing, and awkward, fickle characters. If in a work, the plot is meant to complement the character, and the character the plot, then in this aberration, the plot advances the characters forward, without any heed to the intricacies of how a character actually develops.\\n\\n\r\nLedo\u2019s our protagonist; he\u2019s accentuated to be servile to the mechanical acquiescence of militant dogma, and stubborn to the root; throughout the series, he constantly shifts between having the fervor of a Westboro Baptist preacher when it comes to the holistic condemnation of an entire race, and being an average teenager with notice towards morals and emotion. His character wasn\u2019t really given the \u2018right\u2019 treatment; the former half of the series revolved around making him more human \u2014 the series was fairly enjoyable during this period; the developments weren\u2019t shaky, and it seemed reasonable for him to be initially belligerent towards the foreign preaching of \u2018love\u2019, family, and morals. However, at a breaking point, he essentially left his learned insight bereft, and committed an act antithetical to what he was being developed to be. After that, he becomes a clock-reaction of sorts; fickle to change between being that guy driven by visceral emotion, and being that guy driven by the stringent tenets of the military [for example; during the last episode, he was willing to risk his life for the sake of 'love' towards a girl that he never so as much blushed at, while a few episodes previous, he had condemned her kind to be plain, detestable savages].\\n\\n\r\nBut he\u2019s not the only erratic character in the series. The characters that were developed the most consistently and the \u2018best\u2019, were the ones that were linear and simple; Amy, the heroine, remained consistent, and her actions sought no faults in relative reason \u2014 the nascent commander was devoted an entire episode of development, perhaps the simplest, albeit more realistic progression of character development within the series. Then we have the chain of ridiculously dubious characters; we have the pirate, emblematic of pride, greed, and cruelty, turn contrary during the final episodes into becoming an altruistic hero [\"I'll help you if you give me X; helps without mentioning X again]. We have the mechanic, characterized by an ambivalence between avarice, pride, and greed, all the while holding onto apparent, blatant empathy towards his associates. We also have the mecha, austere in judgement, and strict in dogma \u2014 to valiantly sacrifice itself for the sake of inexplicable love.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the science fiction within the series. There\u2019s a dichotomy of science-fiction series; there\u2019s the series that integrate an explanation for every development [an allusion to a real-world theory, or a pragmatic explanation falling within real-world boundaries], and series that hold the term \u2018science-fiction\u2019 nominally. Suisei no Gargantia belongs to the second category. The series doesn\u2019t attempt to explain most of the occurrences; the plot revolves around the protagonist falling through from one location to another \u2014 the series never attempts to explain how or why. The series bases the primary plot off of an enigmatic lifeform by the appellation of \u201cHideauze\u201d, yet its explanations for its origin are incredibly antithetical to how science actually works [We can't even engineer a major modification for genes within the same species, yet Suisei no Gargantia is comfortable with engineering modifications past the phylum ].\\n\\n\r\nYou also can\u2019t forget the structure of the series. The latter half basically bereaves the mood and developments that the former half worked so hard to craft; if the former half were viewed as a standalone, slice of life, and the latter half, individually as an action series, then perhaps, the respective halves would not be so awkward. But when coalesced, you get an erratic amalgamation of dissonant factors devoid of the slightest harmony. Suisei no Gargantia had thirteen episodes to craft a holistic, reasonable story; they spent half of it on slice of life, and the other half, on erratic plot; they attempted to do far too much within a simple one-cour series [most plot-heavy series require a two-cour season]. The former half made use of the tranquil soundtrack that offered vestigial aid to the latter half, while the latter half boasted forgettable tracks, integrated as simple filler music [also have to note its liberal use of flashbacks, without any further attempt to attenuate its ambiguity, or the usages of dei ex machina with its sudden reveals of certain weapons] .\\n\\n\r\nWhile a work isn\u2019t exactly entirely dependent on the obscure laws of presentation, and of reasonable development, it certainly should at its very core, leave the audience entertained. Yet, it\u2019s hard for me to say that for Suisei; his works as noted, are novel renditions of derivative series \u2014 this work, is awfully similar to his most recent work. More than that, like the previous work, was incredibly vocal with making the characters literally express the themes and the ideas of the work. There\u2019s not grace in conveyance when you\u2019re having a protagonist scream his philosophies in an aggravating, 'let this guy die please' way, and it\u2019s made less so when you have the opponent rebut back in an equally vehement manner [\"You're being immature? I will too].\\n\\n\r\nThe flaw with the series had to do with its potential of being able to easily devote thirteen episodes into crafting an affable slice of life, or even thirteen episodes of reasonable science-fiction, to come short with half a season of shaky developments, and another half of retrospective unimportance. When you force down every other genre down on a series, you might get a stride of adventitious enjoyment, but most of the time, simply avoidable frustration.",

            "content": "Suisei no Gargantia is the latest work of the (in)famous Gen Urobuchi, who did Psycho Pass last season (IG) and the more known, Fate/Zero and Madoka Magica.\r\nWhile I did enjoy the latter, Psycho Pass was pretty bad and so had no high expectations of another sci fi with Gen Urobuchi and IG behind it.\r\nThe show is still airing and I will edit some parts later on, but my overall impressions of the show are set and will only tweaked slightly after the end which will come soon.\r\nStory\r\nSuisei no Gargantia (Gargantia) sets in the distant future, humanity has escaped Earth and fights squid like Aliens calledHideauze in space with spaceships and Mechas.\\n\r\nOne of those mecha pilots is Ledo, the protagonist.\\n\r\nAfter a fight with hideauze he gets suck into a wormhole and ends up on earth which has changed dramatically and now is a water planet.\\n\r\nWith his high tech Mecha Chamber he stays at a (for him) primitive ship called Gargantia, learns the culture and language of the people who stayed on earth.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot moves very slowly, shows you the way people live on earth and deal with everyday tasks. Ledo is \"forced\" into learning the habits of Gargantia and forgetting about his soldier life.\\n\r\nThere are various themes addressed in the show, like what is the value of a human life that is not productive for society (eugenics), co existing with the environment and other human beings, the freedom to do what you want and not what you are ordered to.\\n\\n\r\nIt all sounds nice on paper but Gargantia lacks pretty in that regard. The waste time on fanservice, boring side events and after a while you don't really know what the show is even about.\\n\r\nIs it some sort of anti-war piece?\\n\r\nPro environment?\\n\\n\r\nThankfully the plot advances after it is shown that there are Hideauze on earth and Ledo finds his duty to kill them.\\n\r\nThis leads to some drama, because the Gargantians think of the Hideauze as somewhat holy and don't want to kill them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here I need to make a clear cut. Up onto this point the show wasn't bad, just boring, but episode 9 turned over the entire show.\\n\r\nI don't wanna spoil it yet I feel compelled to do so, since it was outright ridiculous what happened.\\n\\n\r\nAll I can say is that it suddenly becomes inconsistent, cliche and stupid at the same time.\\n\r\nIt's typical Gen Urobuchi shock factor and emotion manipulation which turns the Story into a complete mess that is just laughable.\\n\r\nI have no idea what to expect of the ending, but it's really hard to get your head out of that rope.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nAs usual for IG shows and Urobuchi, the characters are the worst part of the show.\\n\r\nThey are lifeless and have weak personalities, feel unnatural and more like plot devices than real people. \\n\r\nThey behave childish and immature and have no sense of consistency. Especially Ledo as it is shown in episode 9, as he does a 180\u00b0 and behaves totally out of character.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also as usual unlikable and you cannot relate to them, people die... you don't care.\\n\r\nSad things happen... you don't care.\\n\\n\r\nI do blame Urobuchi for this, since the other IG show Attack on Titan (even though a shounen) has much more relatable characters, even if they reek of cliche and simpleness.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation\\n\\n\r\nWe get our typical high standards for animation and art that IG delivers. Not outstanding but very solid.\\n\r\nThe action scenes are great, the colors are vibrant and the backgrounds lush.\\n\r\nThe only problem I had were the female character designs.\\n\r\nAll look a bit slutty and their faces put me off. I know they hired a guy who normally draws hentai characters, so no wonder there. But to me they look like slutty K-On! characters.\\n\r\nThe males on the other hand are pretty good looking though.\\n\\n\r\nThe CGI Mecha and special effects don't bother me and are actually quite good especially in the first episode very nice special effects with many different neon colors. Spacy.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe score for Gargantia is surprisingly weak. The opening and endings are bad (if not horrible) and the background music forgettable.\\n\r\nThe voice actors doing an average job, though I give credit for the fantasy language Ledo uses. It's awkward but creative.\\n\r\nThe sound effects have a good impact and are high quality.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Value\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason the show gets hyped again, mostly because Gen Urubuchi is working on it. But if you ask me the shows is even worse than Psycho Pass and that show was pretty bad already.\\n\\n\r\nI mostly forced myself to watch it up until episode 9 which was actually good for the first half until it became laughable to the end and I literally burst out in laughing at times out of sheer ridiculousness.\\n\\n\r\nIt did add to the enjoyment but in a bad way. I cannot take the show serious and I can never take Urobuchi serious again. This show as the nail in the coffin and will close the chapter of Urobuchsi work for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArtstyle +1 (looks pretty nice, lush colors and realistic looks, gives you a nadia of the blue water feeling)\\n\r\nQuality +1 ( Good IG animation)\\n\r\nBackground +1 (beautiful water scenes, nice textures on the ships)\\n\r\nCharacter Designs -1 ( the female character designs ruin it for me)\\n\r\nVisual Effects +1 (decent use of cgi, nice special effects for lasers and so on)\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting 0 (your standard modern voice acting)\\n\r\nOpening and Ending -1 (terrible terrible terrible)\\n\r\nSoundtrack 0 (not mentionable but also not bad)\\n\r\nSound Effects +1 (good use of effects)\\n\\n\r\nStory or Content 3/10\\n\\n\r\nPremise and Setting +1 (as usually good premise for Urobuchi shows)\\n\r\nPacing -1 (fillers, silly slice of life, boring funeral episode)\\n\r\nComplexity 0 (simple stuff that just tries to be more complex than it is)\\n\r\nPlausibility -1 (none, it\u2019s space magic and misunderstood science when ep9 happens)\\n\r\nConclusion 0 (will most likely be not good based on where the story stands now)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 2/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonality -1 (walking, talking plot devices)\\n\r\nBehavior and Chemistry -1 (unrealistic and out of character, forced drama)\\n\r\nDevelopment and Progression 0 (simplistic)\\n\r\nMotivation and Backdrop 0 (almost none)\\n\r\nLikability -1 (no one was likable)\\n\\n\r\nValue & Enjoyment 1,5/10  rounded down to 1/10\\n\\n\r\nValue -0,5\\n\\n\r\nSentimental -0,5 (will forget about this as soon as I can)\\n\r\nHistorical 0 (not as big as an impact as his other work, will be forgotten)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -3\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation +0 nothing spectacular\\n\r\nSound -1 boring soundtrack and terrible OP\\n\r\nStory and Content -1 stupid makes me cringe\\n\r\nCharacters -1 boring again, no relation to them\\n\\n\r\nOverall score 3,8 ~ 4/10 (bad)\\n\\n\r\nSuisei no Gargantia will have some fans who think it is smart. I thought it was not only stupid but also weak in its exposition.\\n\r\nIt was boring to watch and had nothing to offer.\\n\r\nIts messages are not clear and even if they were I do not agree with them.\\n\\n\r\nIt's Urobuchi attempting to do the same trick he did so many times before and fails harder every time.\\n\\n\r\nStop making sci fi shows if you can't explain anything, it will only end up creating plot holes.\\n\r\nFocus on fantasy like Fate/Zero and Madoka, at least there you can explain everything with magic and focus on the character drama or action.",

Well, this is what Gargantia is all about. It gives the impression of being an all-out action mecha anime, but before you realize, it becomes something else. \r\nThe first episode begins, and we are quickly taken into a rather pro-active exposition of the show's world: The humanity is in danger, and we must fight the ultimate battle against some Whale-squid-like creatures that inhabit the outer space called \"Hideazu\"!!. Somehow, the attack plan backfires and our MainCharacter is thrown into a wormhole. But something went wrong, and our character is now stuck in a place where he has no idea about, and his life will change completely.\\n\\n\r\nYou might have guessed, the place where our character arrives, is the Earth itself. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is mostly about our main character's development, but you may find some surprises. The exposition and exploration of its own world and ideas is one of the reasons why this anime is such an amusing and deep experience. There's a point when you'll start thinking and looking deep into yourself as a person and your purposes in life. Ambitions and goals are really important to grow up and find your own freedom.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and Art are simply fantastic, as it holds high production values. Every atmosphere is achieved perfectly and helps a lot to the inmersion.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was rather short for the development it needed, but it never fails to amuse. Pick this up and watch it, dammit!\\n\\n",

            "content": "If I look back on my experience with Suisei no Gargantia, I can feel the chills of the sea and space envelop my body as a whole. \r\nWhat a ride. \r\nSuisei no Gargantia was definitely one of the animes I always looked forward to watching every week when a new episode came out, and I believe it does deserve plenty of recognition for what it has done. \r\nStory: 8\r\nThe premise from the get-go was very promising - humanity has been forced to leave Earth and is driven to the deep reaches of space, developing highly advanced technology to combat strange foes that spell doom forhumanity. I liked it. However, like with any other anime I watch, I was sure not to get my hopes up to high in case the rest of the anime didn't deliver on the set-up. Fortunately, my caution was not necessary since I was well-satisfied with the content that I was gifted. \\n\\n\r\nThe concept of a futuristic human coming down to Earth, not knowing that it was his race's planet of origin, by itself provided numerous elements to the anime. It provided initial humor at his surprise with some discoveries and engaging action as he explored the now barren realms of Earth's body. When Ledo and Chamber run into some of the indigenous people, a spark of conflict then provides the backbone to the rest of the story, breathing forth a tale of cultural conflicts and drama, with a hint of romance. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is what you would expect out of many of the \"generic\" anime you see in modern times. Nothing new is introduced, but usually that's the way I like it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nMusic and voice acting both completed their jobs well. Their existence was noted, but did not dominate the anime with their presence. They managed to stay discreet and not bring too much attention to themselves, just like they should. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nI think this category is what really did it for me. \\n\\n\r\nLedo is a wonderful character to analyze by himself. As the anime progresses, there is a clear change in his character and his way of thinking. The show does a superb job of showing how Ledo struggles and wrestles with the idea that the ways that he was taught up in space may not be acceptable. While he is very powerful and easily overpowers all of the beings on Earth with Chamber, he is not shown to be invincible, which is something I can really appreciate. \\n\\n\r\nChamber also is a very potent presence in the anime and appears to be Ledo's last connection the world he left behind, causing him to be almost half of Ledo's life. Yet even though I held no expectations for him to surprise me as a character, he surprises me in the end and is the cause of one of the last chills to send down my spine for the anime. \\n\\n\r\nNow we have Amy, the heroine of our story. (For clarification, there are hints of romance between her and Ledo in the story, but it definitely does not consume a majority of the anime) For Amy, I have to say she provides nothing extraordinary as a character, but she definitely is not a hindrance to the anime - which is a lot better than other heroines in other anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are very colorful and have their own backstories that are all covered as the story progresses, and I have to say I found myself engaged in all of them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nFor a 13 episode anime, I have to say they did a wondrous job of compacting a relatively deep and engaging story without sacrificing the usual components such as character development, pacing, and purpose. Both thought-provoking and exciting in numerous regards, Suisei no Gargantia is one anime I would love to see more of in the future.",

            "content": "\"We are tied to the ocean. And when we go back to the sea, whether it is to sail or to watch, we are going back from whence we came.\" \r\nThe ocean is a grand, mysterious, and beautiful thing. At times the ocean is calm and soothing; at other times it is chaotic and disastrous. While the ocean can bring us many memorable spectacles and experiences, it can also be seen as tedious and tiresome. \r\nSuisei no Gargantia began with a lot of potential. Boasting action, mecha, sci-fi genres, beautiful animation, a gorgeous ocean scenery, and a strong pilot episode, one can\u2019t help but anticipatewhat this series has in store for its audience. Despite some interesting elements SnG had to offer, the show came short of meeting the standards it had originally set. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of SnG revolves around Ledo, our main character. As a soldier of the Galactic Alliance all Ledo has known since childhood is how to fight against an evolved species of space alien called the Hideauze. When he unintentionally gets sent to Earth due to an unfortunate chain of events and subsequently salvaged by Gargantia, he is bewildered by this sudden new environment. Earth is shrouded in vast amounts of water, capable of life without advanced technology, and full of mystery. He must then learn to adapt to this new place and befriend the people there if he hopes to survive. His struggle to fit in with his new acquaintances felt peaceful, fun, and overall fairly entertaining. It felt like a slice of life. Thematically, SnG does a good job at addressing key issues like faults with human nature, violence, morality, and struggles with self-identity. \\n\\n\r\nWhat SnG really struggles with story-wise is pacing. More than half of the series is Ledo attempting to fit in with the people of Gargantia and make friends; however, the final few episodes try to incorporate a darker atmosphere and falls short on leaving a lasting impression. There are a couple plot twists here and there that are supposed to surprise the audience but, for the most part, felt predictable; there were several instances where I found myself saying, \"I saw that coming.\" They added more Sci-Fi elements around the end, which I found to be somewhat intriguing, and attempted a sort of natural selection type concept. While I appreciate the idea the series tried to incorporate, it felt much too constricted time-wise to be of much enjoyment. If a certain beach equivalent fan service episode had been replaced with a different episode expanding on the story, SnG may have turned out better. \\n\\n\r\nAs I have said before, the Art/Animation of SnG is visually enticing. Production I.G. typically does a great job at making sure their productions look superb and it shows in Suisei no Gargantia. Colors are very vibrant, the scenery is great, and the animation is fluid; I have no qualms here. Transitioning to the sound portion, I say that overall this section was decent. The OP and ED aren't bad, but there's nothing that stands out too much in them. Sound effects and voice acting are also fair. Something I found commendable was how the show tried something fresh with the language barrier between Ledo and the people of Gargantia. \\n\\n\r\nLedo is the protagonist of the series, and like all main characters he expectantly is subjected to the most character development over the span of the series. He\u2019s puts off the vibe of being a quiet, serious guy that takes his job as a soldier very seriously. He struggles to understand the nature of normal social interactions and picks things up along the way while living on Gargantia. The problem I had here is that Ledo is basically the only one who really gets any development. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the most disappointing aspects of SnG is that the rest of the characters besides Ledo are left in the dust in terms of development and depth. While Amy is supposed to be the main female lead, she seems more like a pretty supporting side character whose only goal is to be a cheerleader and moral support for Ledo. Development-wise I\u2019m not really even quite sure how she developed such an attachment to Ledo because it really isn\u2019t shown in much detail. It seems that she simply is attracted to Ledo because he\u2019s the main character and is apparently a good looking fella. Overall she\u2019s a pretty clich\u00e9 female lead. Chamber, though simply a pilot survival A.I., was probably my favorite 'character' of this series; his witty robotic comments and confusion with human rationale on board Gargantia were consistently entertaining. There was one other character that got a bit of development towards the end, but it just so happened to be Pinion, a mechanic of Gargantia, and possibly the most irritating character of the entire series. When I say irritating, I mean filling \u2018the fool\u2019 character trope and more. He is constantly yelling, rude to nearly everyone, exploits people to satiate his own greedy ambitions, and seems to lack intelligent thought. \\n\\n\r\nSuisei no Gargantia embarked on its journey sailing smoothly, but slowly began treading in rocky waters in regards to plot and character quality. The only redeeming factor in the second half of the series is that the ending was surprisingly good; it\u2019s a happy ending for the most part and concludes the series well. The beginning and ending are exceptional but the series will leave you scratching your head wondering what happened in between. I wouldn't recommend anyone to jump on board and put this series in the number one position for 'Plan to Watch', but I also don't think the show warrants anyone to abandon ship.",

            "content": "Epic crazy battle robot? Or maybe a full-suspense atmoshphere?\r\nWell, thats usually appears in every mecha anime, but have you ever feel a mecha anime with heartwarming feeling? I bet not every mecha had that feeling before. I usually avoided mecha anime, I dont have any particular reasons. I always thought every mecha anime is quite generic like you have robot, you used that for battle then WHAM! (put battle scene in here) and voila! Here is a mecha anime. Surprisingly, Suisei no Gargantia is more than that.\r\nSTORY (9/10)\r\nSuisei no Gargantia is not your usual mecha anime, if you\u2019re looking for epicness mecha like Tengen ToppaGurren Lagann then Suisei no Gargantia is not what you\u2019re looking for. SnG (Suisei no Gargantia) takes a setting in post-apocalypse earth, when humanity cant no longer lives in Island because of some circumtances. Humanity now, are living in the ships. The story focussing on Ledo which is a soldier from another planet that being stranded in Gargantia (is the name of the ships). He is trying to lives in this ship and of course, the lives where he was lived before and in this ship are so different and in this anime, we will see how Ledo adapting in this new environment when the technology is more primitive than he comes from.\\n\\n\r\nSnG is more into slice of life aspects. They brings you a heartwarming feeling and more the pacing that they had was rather slow. It was admitable, because this anime is focussing on the details, like how Ledo (The main character) must learned the language in Gargantia (the place he had stranded) or on how people do their life in a big ship called Gargantia. So, prepare to heard so many dialogues. Although it was slow and many dialogue, but i bet you will enjoyed it in every minutes or even seconds. Even the premise of the story sounds simplistic but later in the story, the story will develop into something that will blows off your mind!\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime, the story was quie enjoyable and moreover, there some exciting twists that makes you feel \u201cAaaarghhh!\u201d and at the other time there was some heartwarming scene that makes you said \u201cOoohh....\u201d. Mixing feelings between heartwarming and some epic moments in this anime mix well and thats what makes Suisei no Gargantia is so appealing.\\n\\n\r\nART (10/10)\\n\r\nIf i could said, the art in this anime was the best among the other anime that same airing in Spring 2013 no.. even for the other anime. In this anime, They use colorful color and makeit so artistic. The background was heavenly beautiful. Maybe some of you thought, with ship as the background, does it will make the atmosphere dull and plain? You\u2019re wrong. Thats what i thought at the first time but when i watching this anime, the art makes the ship (Gargantia) looks so beautiful, rich colour, and brings out the cheerful atmospheres. From the art and the background itself i can tell that the atmosphere that the creator wants to make is cheerful one and that mixs well with the story and what i could said is the background is the greatest parts on this anime. Its so memorable and beautiful! Eyegasm!\\n\\n\r\nNot just with the background , the character design is the best too. There was a steampunk and sci-fi feels and more it was realistic. Like many of the girl characters is in brown skin, Well, they live in ship and received sunlight everday, thats quite logic. And what makes me more excited was the most character is unique, i usually side character have similiar design for each characters but its not in Suisei no Gargantia. Every character have their own uniqueness in terms of design like in the clothes or anything like that and not just the human character that was appealing, the mecha design is quite great too. For mecha like Chamber (a mecha that Ledo used), they use 3-D graphic. It makes the mecha looks so cool and moreover, its blended well with the rest of animation. A perfect art if i could said.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (8/10)\\n\r\nFor the songs, i found the opening song and the ending was quite catchy. I love the opening song \u201cKono Sekai \u201c by Minor Chihara , I never skip the OP parts, the song is so easy listening and quite catchy tunes. Its maybe my favorite OP for spring anime beside Shingeki no Kyojin OP. For the ending song, i dont really remember it. It doesnt have anything special.\\n\r\nFor the seiyuu, we have Hisaka Kanemoto for Amy, Kaito Ishikawa as Ledo, Ai Kayano as Saya. Maybe the one that you havent never heard before was Kaito Ishikawa. Well, i am actually surprised that he is a newcomer but the quality of his sound doesnt represent him as \u2018newcomer\u2019, it sounds like he is a pro seiyuu. He is really fits as Ledo, like when Ledo stutter after learning earth language, thats totally remarkable! I think he is doing his job very well. For other seiyuu, i think i dont have to mention all of them since we know their quality. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (9/10)\\n\r\nThe main character of this anime, Ledo is quite cool and attractive guy. He is really fits as the main character of this anime, not just because his looks but also the personality that he have. Gen Urobuchi seems making the character react for every events in most realistic way, like when Ledo stranded in Gargantia, He doesnt feel to comfortable with his new environment because it doesnt match with his stance (weak people doesnt deserve to die). I love the way how the character react to events in logic and realistic way, we can said, there isnt any action that bases from unrealistic thinking but its more about realistic and moreover the development in Ledo is quite remarkable, it was quite logic considering the environtment that he lives now, supporting him. Quite logic, huh?\\n\\n\r\nThe other main character that we should mention is, Amy. Amy is the first person that interact with Ledo, she is quite cheerful and cute person. I think she is my favorite character in this spring anime, I love the pairing within a cool and quiet guy with cheerful girls. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, i love all the characters in Suisei no Gargantia. They all have their own uniqueness and moreover there wasnt any character that being wasted, everyone have their own roles. Its like everyone have their own time to shine.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nWhen people focusses on Shingeki no Kyojin and Hataraku Maou Sama (airing same as Suisei no Gargantia).They forgot to mention one another great anime, its called Suisei no Gargantia. Not many people take their eyes on this anime. It such a waste if i can said. With superb art quality like Makoto Shinkai works (not in terms of realistic art but in artistic way) and heartwarming story, Suisei no Gargantia can take away my attention from SnK and i dont regret it. Dont said just because this is a mecha so you wouldnt watched it, believe me, i dont really like mecha too but this anime was different it was focussing on slice of life aspects. You will regret it if you miss this show!",

            "content": "There\u2019s a certain kind of excellence that I always pursue to discover within an anime - one that doesn\u2019t have categories for scores, but rather, lives by one rationale - the desire to achieve and execute a goal. If I can see such a desire within the production team of said anime, I don\u2019t have to rely on 1-10 scores or categories to judge an anime - I\u2019ll simply know that it will be good, because the people behind it, are passionate souls with a love for what they do.\r\nOf course, I\u2019m not here to rattle on about my definition about a \u201cgood anime\u201d butrather, to tell you my opinions of one that does fit the above descriptor - Suisei no Gargantia.\\n\\n\r\nSo, naturally, I can\u2019t simply give you my requirements for a good anime, and not apply them to Gargantia. The question is, obviously, did I see such passion within Gargantia? Absolutely. In fact, It\u2019s been awhile (three months) since an airing anime caught my attention in the same manner that Gargantia did. As soon as I watched the first episode, Gargantia struck me with potential. And to an extent, that potential was pretty well met.\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time though, it\u2019s kinda hard to just label Gargantia as an anime with a passionate production team, because if I did do that, this review would not only be very short, but very uninteresting. Gargantia, isn\u2019t just an anime with a passionate team, its an anime with an excellent setting, an excellent story, an excellent cast, and excellent art and sound. In almost all aspects, Gargantia is an excellent anime. A very excellent anime indeed.\\n\\n\r\nI can still recall that first episode - that amazing setting and plot, and that creative cliffhanger at the finale of the first episode of Gargantia. If there\u2019s one thing that I\u2019d pick out as my absolute favorite aspect of Gargantia, it would have to be it\u2019s setting and story. The premise is interesting - the remnants of humanity years after the abandonment of earth by the majority of earth\u2019s population. Although Gargantia takes a more relaxed pace in it\u2019s first few episodes exploring Ledo\u2019s daily life following his arrival to the now-water-filled Earth, Gargantia really picks up the pace halfway through it\u2019s season. Now, although it\u2019s refreshing to find an anime like this that isn\u2019t entirely story driven, I\u2019m kinda more partial to Gargantia leaning more towards the story side of the spectrum, and distancing itself from the daily life style that it took in it\u2019s first few episodes. That being said, although only half of Gargantia was focused on it\u2019s main story, those six episodes, were still very well realized. Not only was the climax of the story actually pretty suspenseful, it threw some fairly interesting plot twists along the way that made the storyline much more involving and interesting. Although I could see the argument that Gargantia's plot was somewhat underdeveloped being thrown, I\u2019d have to somewhat disagree. The first half of Gargantia didn\u2019t only prove to illustrate Ledo\u2019s daily life upon Gargantia, it also set a few things in motion that eventually led to the perpetration of what I would refer to as the main story. And even though the latter half, the \u201cmain story\u201d was somewhat packed, I still found the pacing of the entire anime quite good. Gargantia wasn\u2019t rushed, nor was it too slow, and the progression of events was written out quite well.\\n\\n\r\nThis, was well voiced through Gargantia\u2019s well-animated medium. One thing that instantly struck out to me about Gargantia, other than it\u2019s story, was it\u2019s style. The animation style of Gargantia is as per usual of most modern animes, quite good, with fairly fluid battle animations and excellent artwork. However, Gargantia takes it to a slightly higher level, and possesses a uniqueness to it\u2019s animation style that isn\u2019t present in many more recent animes. Not only is such a style unique, but it\u2019s also fitting to Gargantia alone, and compliments the anime as a whole. In my own opinion, that is how \u201cperfect\u201d animation artwork should be done. It shouldn\u2019t just be a sterile way to paint a story with some characters, it should be an entity on it\u2019s own, with it\u2019s own expressive abilities and it\u2019s own message. Gargantia\u2019s animation is a good example of that. The drawing style of Ledo, compared to the style of the rest of the earth inhabitants, is a very good example of this. In this case, it\u2019s the stark difference between the sterile, white-haired, pale skinned Ledo, to the naturally darker, more colorful antics of the inhabitants of Gargantia that really paints a message all in itself. See, that, is animation that adds to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was one place that didn\u2019t shine as bright as the other aspects of Gargantia, it would probably have to be the soundtrack. Although the opening and endings of Gargantia were good, and some could say, better than most, they weren\u2019t anything really special and incredible. Yes, they were good, however, they weren\u2019t as good in quality as the rest of the anime itself. Although the BGM escapes this, it doesn\u2019t do so by much, as such quality is almost expected of an anime in this modern day and time.\\n\\n\r\nTo make up for it\u2019s somewhat lackluster BGM and opening/ending, Gargantia actually has a pretty awesome cast. And it doesn\u2019t end there - the development on said cast, is really quite good for a 13-episode anime. In addition, unlike the story, which was biased more towards the latter half of the anime, the character development is excellent all the way through, only stunted slightly by the fast-paced nature of the latter half. Of course, I really can\u2019t talk about character development without mentioning the alien Ledo, as we can\u2019t really forget about the fact that Ledo is essentially a stranger in a strange, strange land. Not only is he a stranger, he\u2019s also a cut-out soldier with one unquestionable goal in mind, and possesses values that are very far from the values of those on this new, flooded earth. I think the development here, and the conflict, is quite obvious. It\u2019s amazing how much development is made within Ledo\u2019s character alone in just 13 episodes. Even more amazing, is probably the development of the surrounding characters - the members of Gargantia, and most interestingly, Ledo\u2019s machine caliber, Chamber. To be honest, I\u2019m actually partial on the \u201cdevelopment\u201d of Chamber as a character, as it was one of the more random aspects of Gargantia. It was pretty unexpected, and although I praise Gargantia for actually developing Chamber as a character, I know for a fact that I won\u2019t be alone if I decide to go along the path of deciding that it was probably a bad idea. There\u2019s another example of this, however, for the sake of not spoiling Gargantia for those who haven\u2019t watched it, I won\u2019t digress into that.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I will digress into though, is my dissapointment with Gargantia. Hell, don\u2019t read that wrong, I wasn\u2019t disappointed with Gargantia whatsoever as an anime. It was awesome. I was disappointed that there was only 13 episodes. I know I\u2019m not alone when I find myself wanting more, more of Ledo, more of Amy, more of Bellows and more of Pinion, and I know for a fact that I\u2019m probably not (probably) alone when I cry myself to sleep at night digressing over what I\u2019m going to do now that Gargantia\u2019s over. Wait, pretend you didn\u2019t read that last part. That\u2019s personal. In all seriousness though, the one thing that Gargantia needs, is a second season. It has so much promise as a legendary anime, and so much more content and possibilities that it could so easily explore that a second season seems only logical in my opinion. Not only would it be awesome, it would also probably be pretty popular as an anime, and I for one, fully support the creation of a second season, for I know that I\u2019ll see the same amount of passion in it as I did the first season. Because as it stands, the story of Gargantia has only begun. There\u2019s so many more things that I want to know, not only about Ledo, or the history of the Gargantia fleet, but about the history of Earth within the world of Suisei no Gargantia, the fate of the Galactic Alliance and the war, and the development in communication with the Hideauze.\\n\\n\r\nSo please, passionate staff of Gargantia, please, use that creative genius to the greatest extent and bring us more of this incredible anime.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be waiting, Gargantia.",

            "content": "Suisei no Gargantia (Gargantia On The Verdurous Planet) is a 13 episode television series produced by Production IG, and notable for being primarily written by Gen Urobuchi, the mind behind such shows as Madoka Magica and Fate/Zero. Now before I start this review proper, I feel it's important to note that while Urobuchi has a track record of writing very dark shows with many characters dying and falling into despair, Gargantia is a very much different kind of show for him, for while it contains many similar themes to what he has tackled before, the show has an overall much more positive message to it.But more on that later, for now, let's tackle the story.\\n\\n\r\nGargantia focuses on Ledo, a soldier in the Human Galactic Alliance, a coming together of the remnants of humanity in space to combat strange alien like lifeforms known as the \"Hideauze\". This has been Ledo's life since birth, fighting for humanities survival in the cruel confines of space. But when a mission goes wrong, Ledo inadvertently lands on a distant planet, far from the rest of his kind. When he wakes up, he is shocked to find himself on an inhabitable planet, where people live on the ocean in great united sea vessels, with none of the high tech technology Ledo is used to seeing. Even more surprising is that this world is a place that he had only heard of in myths, a place thought to be lost long ago: Earth.\\n\\n\r\nThe stories setup is simple, with a young man winding up in a new environment he's not used to at all, and his attempts to acclimate to the situation. But despite this, the story really shines because of it's solid execution that always leaves you wanting to know more about this world where people live on the open seas. You want to see how their lives are lived, what things have changed, what things have stayed the same. You'll also want to stay for the themes explored, such as what it really means to be a human, and what it really means to be happy and free. And most of all, you'll want to stay for the characters. \\n\\n\r\nGargantia has an amazing cast. Our protagonist, Ledo, is a typical hardcore soldier, who lives his life with a sort of \"My purpose is to kill enemies with no mercy, and nothing else\" sort of attitude about him. And this makes a lot of sense, considering that all he's known was fighting all his life. But on this new world, Ledo will be forced to change his ways and adapt to the much more peaceful, co-existent humans who live there. Over the course of the story, Ledo will constantly have to question his motives, wondering if he should stay true to what he was taught and be a soldier and nothing else, or if he should let his interactions with the humans of Earth change him and make him see that their's more to life. \\n\\n\r\nRounding out the cast, we have Chamber, a flying mech that also serves as a Pilot Interface System that Ledo uses throughout the show. Chamber is a typical AI most of the time, providing factual information and suggestions, while also inadvertently being hilarious. But Chamber is not just a lifeless shell, as he proves as the series goes on by slowly showing more and more advanced thoughts. In addition to Chamber, we have Amy, the first Earth human that Ledo interacts with, and the one who really shows him the ropes of living on their ship, The Gargantia. Then there's Pinion, the excavator who has an obsession with unearthing the treasures of the past, and is determined to have Ledo help him. Finally, there's Ridget, who struggles with trying to take command of the fleet and will need all the help she can get to keep the crew of The Gargantia together. There are many more characters in addition to these, and all of them have their own distinct personalities and quirks.\\n\\n\r\nIn a show with only thirteen episodes, it would be understandable if only a few characters got the spotlight while the others were put on the backburner a bit. But that is not the case here. While it is true that more focus goes onto some characters than others, each one has their chance to shine, and they all have grown in some way by the end. Sadly, the story does take a bit of a hit due to the lack of episodes however, with the ending feeling a bit rushed. Gargantia definitely could have been a 24 episode show, as there was much more that could have been done with the world and characters in that time. But considering they were only working with 13 episodes, the creators did a fantastic job of fitting everything in, even if it did feel a bit rushed at the end.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a production values standpoint, Gargantia is very good. The music is fairly standard fare, fitting the mood but never really standing out. The opening and ending are quite good however, with the next episode preview situated nicely in the actual ending itself.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the animation, there isn't much to complain about. All in all, there isn't a whole lot of action in Gargantia, but even so the animation remains crisp and fluid throughout, using a lot of bright colors and backgrounds that really show off the fleet of The Gargantia nicely. Character designs are all well done, and when the show does hamper down and there IS action, the fine folks at Production IG remind us just how amazing they can be, and provide us with some even better visuals. All in all, the animation of Gargantia in excellent. \\n\\n\r\nSo at the end of the day, Gargantia is a great watch, packed with colorful animation, a well written story, and interesting characters. It may have been a bit better with a longer run time, but I came out of Gargantia very satisfied regardless, and I would recommend this anime to just about anyone.",

            "content": "Suisei no Gargantia is a recent mecha series from Production I.G, which doesn't tell me much since they've been involved in quite a few projects some good and some terrible. There is an ongoing manga adaptation by Mitogawa Wataru. It came out before the actual anime, but the anime was in production long before the manga's release. I have heard virtually nothing about it, so I'm going into this one pretty much blind. I hope it turns out better than the last time I said that. I need something at least tolerable after Cheese Steak Suppository and School Days or I may have to startdrinking and that would just be playing into the cultural stereotype. Let's take a look and find out.\\n\\n\r\nOur story begins with a group of mecha pilots preparing to do battle against crustaceans, in space. You know, this may not be a very scientifically accurate anime. Still, I have to admit that it is kind of an awesome concept. The battle follows our protagonist, Ensign Ledo. Who ends up getting separated from the rest of his team. When he regains consciousness, his AI partner, Chamber, informs him that he's been in artificial hibernation for quite some time and their location is unknown. All they know for certain is that they're surrounded by people they can't understand the language of, who are trying unsuccessfully to take Chamber apart. One of the problems with the story is that it's kind of predictable. You can tell what the basic arc is going to be pretty early on, although some of the techniques they use to get from one point to another are quite surprising, even though genre savvy already told you where the story was going. In short, the overarching plot is obvious, but the specifics can be interesting. Another issue is that they clearly don't understand science. Some of it is excusable, since they are working with a futuristic world with technology far ahead of ours, but there are some points where they bring in concepts that we understand pretty well and they get them wrong. Which can be distracting. A more minor issue is that there's some rather crude and problematic humour in one episode. Since it's limited to that one episode, it's not a huge problem though. That being said, there are plenty of aspects that the anime handles well. The world they build is compelling. They handle the \"Fish out of Water\" element exceedingly well. The ending, though kind of rushed, is well handled overall. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this are great. They react to things like real people would and develop pretty naturally over the course of the series. Their motivations and actions make perfect sense based on their backgrounds. When you find out something about a character's personal history it serves to help you understand why they are the way they are, which indicates that the personal histories were either planned ahead of time or very well thought out. Even the more minor characters have a sense of verisimilitude. The only weakness when it comes to characters are the ultimate antagonists. I won't spoil it, but the explanation behind their actions is pretty flimsy. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this is really good. The action sequences are appropriately chaotic while being easy to follow. The backgrounds can be downright breathtaking, they're so well designed and animated. The character designs are good. The various fauna are really well detailed. I only have one complaint about the art, those of you who read my reviews consistently can probably guess what it is, the Fan-service. There's a belly dancing scene that serves absolutely no purpose and there are some other moments where the angle or the costuming in general, is done for the sole purpose of providing fan-service. It's kind of annoying. And, frankly, the major female characters are too young to be shown in an objectified fashion. In all fairness, most of the costumes do make sense for the scenario. There are just a few cases where they make an exception. \\n\\n\r\nThe vocal cast in this is exceptional. I haven't heard Ishikawa Kaito in anything else, but he gives a really good performance. Kanemoto Hisako and Fujimura Ayumi are also really good. But the best performance has to be from Sugita Tomokazu. He is amazing in this. Certainly at the best I've ever heard him and I've heard him in quite a few roles. Including, but not limited to, Suzumiya Haruhi's Kyon, Chobits' Hideki and Nanoha's Chrono. The music is also really well done and really serves to enhance the action. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 3/10. Rackage is heavily implied to have yuri girl followers, although she does very little with them, and there are some scenes where Amy and her friends get really touchy. Scenes like this, however, are infrequent and ultimately don't amount to much. \\n\\n\r\nIt looks like I won't have to take up drinking after all. Suisei no Gargantia is a good anime. It has some rather substantial flaws, but nothing so bad that it should affect your enjoyment too much. My final rating is a solid 7/10.",

By the time Psycho Pass was conceived, there were cries of predictability.\r\nMany believe that Gargantia was somewhat a failure, and some of them even called it\u201cUrobuchi\u2019s worst to date.\u201d I will assert that Gargantia of the Verdurous Planet was more like a minor success.\\n\\n\r\nOne may argue that Psycho Pass builds upon a very uninspired dystopian theme, a utopian-wannabe surveillance society.  That was so over ten years ago.  Gargantia seemed to head down the same path.  It started out with a rather cliched scenario: child soldier who knows nothing but war, becomes stranded with a peaceful society.  Subsequently cues character development and all sort of cheesy stuffs about war is bad, humanity is cruel and deep stuffs happen.  However, what is unique about Gargantia that made it worked (at first) is the very nice contrasts between the characters and also thanks to the initial superb directing.  Ever pondered why 90% of anime protagonists are third-year high school students?  Because they are shows aimed towards wish-fulfillment for the primary demographic.  In Gargantia, Ledo\u2019s teenage age is fitting in capturing his impressionable innocence.  Amy, the primary supporting protagonist, also belongs in the age group.  She serves as the foil of Ledo.  Her character, in every way, acts like your typical uninspired genki anime girl.  But that is the very beauty of characterization!  Her adowableness serves as the foil for Ledo\u2019s uptight military formality. Amy\u2019s archetype is the way normal teenagers usually act.  It would not have worked anywhere near as well if Ledo was some old coarse-voiced disillusioned old man.  It was a simple touch, not particularly clever, but brilliant regardless!  Urobuchi\u2019s characters are being more than just dull for once?  I am not certain if it is an actual improvement, or if it was because there were other scriptwriters taking the helm each episode.  I will give him the benefit of the doubt.\\n\\n\r\nThe first four episodes were superb, the best part of the series.  I daresay that those were one of the strongest opening episodes I have ever seen and they went a long way in humanizing Ledo as a character.  Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet could have become something greater.  Unfortunately, that did not last.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 5 aired, and the show took a huge dip. It introduced a plethora of issues to the writing, as well as being the worst episode in the show.  A beach episode in a show that so far had been rather solemn and sincere.  This turn of events ruined the tone, pacing and consistency for the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing the turning point, the subsequent episodes consist of more world-building.  I would have been fine if the world-building actually conveys some meaning, but it was inconsequential.  Despite a nice set-up from the first four episodes, there were no real conflicts until episode 8.  I eventually ran out of patience for the show due to its incoherent plot.  Consequently, a lot of fans started to jump ship (sorry).  Even after the big twist, everything was underwhelming and unmemorable.  The conflicts introduced are messy and didn\u2019t really follow through, especially anything that involves the whalesquid/Hadiauze.\\n\\n\r\nThe finale was actually quite decent, but by that point I just didn\u2019t care anymore.\\n\\n\r\nThe most lamentable issues lie in the characters.  Everyone besides Ledo and Chamber eventually suffers from extremely shallow characterization, typical of Urobuchi Gen.  Amy started out great, but became an progressively flatter (yes, her chest too). She just becomes this background character who cries for Ledo every now and then, not the assertive girl who actively befriended him at the start of the series.  After the series\u2019 run, Amy was reduced to a pointless romantic subplot.  Her dynamic with Ledo became stale and stereotypical of anime high school romance.  The antagonists are rather silly.  The inconsistency of their actions were jarring.  They felt somewhat similar to the villains in Sword Art Online.  They were cheesy, shallow, and do not actually seem threatening, just stupid.  There are also good characters that have been left mostly untouched who would have greatly contributed to the story such as Bebel, Dr. Oldham, and Bellows.  Wasted potentials!\\n\\n\r\nLedo\u2019s growth as a character was the most enjoyable part about Gargantia.  I can almost compare his growth to that of Waver from Fate/Zero.  His kindness is pure innocence and self-awareness, rather than a bland self-insert that plagues every other anime nowadays.  He possessed a childish obsession over Amy\u2019s well-being.  He wants to protect her not simply because he is a generic nice person, but because Amy is his first treasured companion.  His love for her was subtle, and non-sensual.  Ledo\u2019s romantic interest in Amy is depicted not as between a man and a woman, but bears more resemblance of a family love.  His conversations with Babel were very nice touches that serve to make the family motif evident.\\n\\n\r\nChamber is my favorite character in the show.  He is the ultimate bro!  Well, probably inferior to Rider, but still a bro!  Throughout the course of 13 episodes, he is always the voice of the reason and at the same time, a snarky sidekick who is comically serious.  Urobuchi has always been terrible at exposition, and his dialogues tend to be on the boring heavy-handed side.  This time around however, Chambro was perfect for info-dumping and conveying the theme to the audience.  Gargantia is seen through Ledo\u2019s and Chambro\u2019s perspectives.  Ledo ponders about his surrounding, and Chambro forms his conjectures about the world.  Everything flows together smoothly and more naturally, as opposed to being obligatory and obviously shoed in.  It is definitely more engaging than listening to pretentious dudes quoting famous literature while preaching about Sibyl.  The best aspect of it all, or maybe rather sad, is that Chambro felt more human than everyone else, bars Ledo.  He was able to develop a certain degree of empathy, sentience and free-will in a much more believable way compared to Yui from SAO.  Through a series of accumulated data, he came to his own conclusion, overcoming the restrictive protocols of the Galactic Alliance.  If everything else sucked about this show, Chamber is extremely well-written to somewhat compensate.\\n\\n\r\nWhy is Gargantia a relative success regardless of its various blunders?  Despite it being a very safe show that take little risks, Urobuchi Gen finally deviates from his standard fare and tries out something different.  That is a healthy mindset to have, something the industry definitely needs more.  Unlike his other works, Gargantia is the most optimistic of all.  Its light-heartedness just ring more true to me as a futuristic slice-of-life than anything else.  In that respect, Gargantia is a pretty respectable slice-of-life.",

            "content": "An epic anime with a tremendous misplaced potential. Produced by studio Production IG, one of the most promising anime-studio there is, plus made by the renowned Gen Urobuchi, who's notable for his works: Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Psycho Pass, and Fate/Zero---well, meet their cousin: Suisei no Gargantia (Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet). The stage is set for one of the most misplaced potential anime there is.\r\nJust by looking at these titles: Madoka Magica, Psycho Pass, and Fate/Zero, the veil of darkness is wrapped on these (in)famous anime, yet Gargantia took the opposite take; it's lighter and less casualty-oriented, among other themes that you would notreally expect from Urobuchi-san.\\n\\n\r\nStill, after finishing the 13-episodes + 2 OVAs, I dare say this anime is on the same level as the other works I've mentioned here, just that it has the \"misplaced potential\" on its stead.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY = 8\\n\r\nAt first, I was certain that the Gundam Series are the only legit mecha-anime that could pull these kind of story themes, wtih Gurren Lagann, and the original Aquarion (the original one, okay~ the \"Evol\" evolved into ecchi) being able to do just as unforgettable. Gargantia also rivaled those titles with its light-to-dark story, mecha-involved 13-episode (+2 OVA).\\n\\n\r\nART = 9\\n\r\nFluid, great anime, something you expect much from Production IG. They made Psycho Pass after all, that anime led me to notice what \"Production IG\" can do. With Gargantia, it met up with my expectations art-wise.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND = 9\\n\r\nA-ok songs, background music, and most notably, the seiyuu cast.\\n\r\nA \"slight error\" by my source (aka. friend) told me that Kanae Itou is the one voicing Amy, but when I first heard her voice, without checking it here in MAL, I straight away know its Ika Musume's seiyuu: Hisako Kanemoto. She did a great job alright. Ishikawa Kaito as the voice of Ledo, I kept it particular and acute that he was able to be convincing in \"breaking\" his Japanese fit for Ledo who has a hard time blending with his language against the people in Gargantia.\\n\r\nTomokazu Sugita as the voice of Chamber: to say Gintoki and Kyon's voice being able to sound like an AI, these talents of these seiyuus deserve a 10 really---the 9 was intended for the other parameters of this category (like the BGM).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER = 10\\n\r\nIf I could rate this as 20, 20 it is. This is an anime that transcend to the usual \"character types\". Here, the character types doesn't necessarily apply being protagonist or antagonist. Urobuchi-san clearly demonstrates what he can do with characterization after making spellbinding anime. I first salute to \"Rinne no Lagrange\" for breaking the usual protagonist/antagonist archetype, and Gargantia did just as good--with less cliche even.\\n\r\nCharacterization here clearly demonstrates the 3D parameters; one that you don't see the \"protagonist\" being the main cast and main seiyuu, but the antagonist also has the same weigh and reason of the protagonists' existence.\\n\r\nWe're talking of out-of-the-book characterization here after all, and not something like Power Rangers where we know exactly who's the protagonist/antagonist the first thing we saw 'em.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT = 9\\n\r\nFrom the story, to characters, it's all enjoyable. Reviews here in MAL states that it has a \"slow\" start, but then again we all know the drill of this by now: Madoka Magica, Gurren Lagann, Kill la Kill, Gundam Seed, Steins;Gate, AnoHana, etc, every epic unforgettable anime there is has a \"s;ow\" start.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL = 9\\n\\n\r\nIF James Cameron has a kind of plot or theme like this, and incorporated it to Avatar, or perhaps made \"Avatar 2\" with this kind of theme---then we might forget he directed and wrote the script for Titanic.\\n\\n\r\nBorrowing the elements of mecha or not, Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet is a solid, ground-breaking anime with three-dimension-characters and nihilistic themes in color rather than in dark---and HENCE the recipe for misplaced potential.\\n\\n\r\nMisplaced Potential--why? Because an anime or a story like this is NOT intended for \"anime fans\". The slow-pacing, the more dramatic, three-dimensional characterization, and themes that conflicts the essence of humanity needs an appreciation that does not NEED to borrow the essence of either \"wicked\" or \"dark\" enough, and does not need to be filled with fight-scenes and effects JUST for anime-fans to appreciate it.\\n\\n\r\nSure, the term \"anime fan\" leaves a bad taste in the mouth; but since 2008 this is what I kept on observing. Why I'll slam this context in this review is all because of my observations. Like take it like this: a deep story with light-elements like Gargantia and you get a MAL rating of 7.78.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, getting a high rating is as easy as enticing anime-fans by simply throwing ecchi anime and various fanservice, and you'll never go wrong to say that the MAL rating received on those kind of ecchi goes a rating of 8 and above.\\n\\n\r\nStill, not every anime-fan is ecchi-hungry and \"needs to be amused\"; there are those who sits intensively on shows like Steins;Gate and PsychoPass. \\n\r\nSo for \"Gargantia on Verdurous Planet\", try to see if you're the kind of fan who watches for the plot, or the kind who watches for the fanservice and being amused; as this is pretty much intended to the former as it holds a promise of a \"misplaced potential\" great anime.",

That's all i was thinking of while i'm watching a 20min episode of an anime without non-reasoning behind it.\r\nEverything was awesome in the first episode but they got the wrongidea to develop the main character. I bet everyone felt the same as i am, The more you watch it, the more you know that the world they live on is just a little **** of some people enjoying the sun with sunscreens and some useless things.\\n\\n\r\nThe story kind of sounds a military anime but its not unfortunately. Some guy was fighting in the space, with his friends to survive (it sounds there going for something upper space, but then) he woke up in earth! in the middle of some fleet called Gargantia (sounds more adventures) and somehow all it matter is to know where he is or how to connect with his friends (and he still done nothing other than playing around).\\n\\n\r\nI really don't feel like making a long review, since i always suck at English grammar.

            "content": "Suisei no Gargantia voyeurs off into something different, from what it originally suggests from the first episode. A vast collection of ideas are collaborated, but bringing together such an abundant amount of concepts in a short frame of time, doesn't do itself justice. Consequently the anime is left unrefined and falls into a continuous decline, squandering its uncharted potential. But in the end, it still remains a decent anime.\r\nIt is apparent that Suisei no Gargantia had alot of potential, from just the first few episodes. Beginning in space, fighting against the alien race, only to be shifted into an opposing world, of conflicting ideals. Thesituation brings out promising character development in which the cast of characters must follow their own ethics. And the first half of the series achieves this extremely well. Ledo, the main protagonist, is constrained to the lifestyle of the Earthlings which can only create a change character. Having previously been living a life of nothing but fighting for the sake of fighting, adapting can only prove difficult to such an unfamiliar habitat. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters do not go under such serious characterization but are given a chance to understand the unknown universe from Ledo. Amy, the female protagonist, is more or less like an accomplice, acting as a catalyst to hasten the change of Ledo's character. She does so by inflicting her own ideals, onto Ledo. Despite Amy meaning to be a main character, her character lacks in many areas, only to make her appear as a guide to Ledo. Similarly, majority of the rest of the cast seems as if they're purpose is to either advance the plot or assist Ledo's change in character. Which is disappointing since it feels like Chamber is the only character achieving more than the other characters. Chamber advances the series, and breaches the limitations of human nature to explore and understand the unknown.\\n\\n\r\nBut suddenly the development becomes passive and Suisei no Gargantia flips upside down and starts declining. The light-hearted atmosphere disperses with the introduction of the main complication. While the storyline remains intact, for the time-being, the characters show minimal development. Secondary characters, do move away from the shadows of Ledo and into the light temporarily, but they lack empathy. In the end the camera is fixated on Ledo and Chamber, from start to end.  \\n\\n\r\nArtistically, it is beautiful from the start. The contrasting worlds are both equally portrayed. The galactic universe is gloomy, dark and vast, showing that the universe is grander than we could grasp. Meanwhile the world of Gargantia is floating on a layer of shimmering water, which only strengthens the feeling of serenity and peacefulness. The environment is greater than the character models, to an extent. Not to say it is lacking, but it's not outstanding. Individual primary characters look well, notably the eyes. The eyes had something about them which really leaped out from the rest of character, which is a rarity. The emotions of the characters can be felt, especially of the primary characters. But the effect dims down towards the end as there was a noticeable drop in quality.  \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack enhances the atmosphere by focusing on the use instrumental pieces. The relaxing music only builds the tranquillity and peace suiting the situation. At the halfway mark there is an abrupt change in styles, which instead aims to build tension and drama. Although it is  satisfying, you can't help but feel disappointed by the change, when becoming accustom to it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's not bad, and it has done a good job of not feeling rushed despite being only 13 episodes in length. This is probably due to a fair bit of the potential storyline being left out, which could of expanded the plot and concepts of humanity. It was disappointing that it didn't reach its capability, but Suisei no Gargantia still has its charms. \\n\\n\r\nI personally see Suisei no Gargantia about the difficulties a character faces to  fit into society, but there a more than one viewpoints.",

            "content": "Well Susei No Gargantia is a 2013 anime created by: Production I.G, and written by Gen Urobuchi. It is the first \u201cHealing\u201d anime written by Gen Urobuchi. This is totally out of his style, and to me is the reason of its Failure as a story.  \r\nSusei No Gargantia is about the adjustment of a solider from space war time, to the easy going life of the remnants of now flooded Earth.  Of which he is at first confused about, but learns to adjust and live with them. It\u2019s a story about a battle a torn man (teenager) moving on with his life.This type of story has been done multiple times, but in anime it has only happened in comedic situations successfully. (I.E:  Gintama (sometimes serious), Full Metal Panic). This is the first anime of this story type that I have seen in not a comedic light. Personally I had very high hopes. I thought Gen could do this very well with a dark story, with PTSD, ghosts of the character\u2019s past coming back to haunt him and the main character learning the true value of peace in this manner. Yet, Gen goes a somewhat carefree route. The main character Ledo tries to get a Job, adjust to life, and he can\u2019t manage to do it. He just looks plain bored. Morales of society, what it means to be happy, and the human condition are presented throughout the story.  Yet, it fails to leave any impression. The Morales tend to be barely audible. Gargantia\u2019s story seems never to leave a lasting impression, and never really makes you think as it should. This coupled with a predictable plot brought down by near ridiculous characters results in a driveled mess of a story.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt is done well. Production I.G always does a \u201cgood\u201d job. Not really much symbolism in the art, a little here and there, but not much. The color pallets used in Gargantia are vibrant and bright. This is trying to show the brightness of this happy life. This couples with interesting designs of ships and weapons results in some good vibrant scenes in terms of art. The one greatest flaw was the mecha design. Which was\u2026 sub-par and does not look as a viable design. It would have been forgivable if they had looked cool. Yet, alas the mecha just looks odd. I see they tried to do something bold, yet as many agree it fell on its face in mecha design.  Overall beside\u2019s this mecha design, Production I.G does a great Job on the art.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8/10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nit was virtually unnoticeable. Very rarely was an Ost good (no Ost choice), but nothing bad. Very safe on sound and OSTs. Weapons though I will say had very satisfying sounds when fired. I enjoyed the Railgun blast sound effect. The Op is standard J pop and same with the Ed, nothing great, nothing bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are where Gargantia is insanely hit or  miss. The general design for guys is typical, but looks really good. On the other hand Every girl under the age of 20 in this show seems to be a loli and has a perma blush with mid drift to boot. Any girls in the 20 to 30\u2019s seem to have allot of \u201cplot\u201d on their chest.  Our main protagonist is a boy named Ledo who was once a solider in a Spartan like utopia in space. Who I might add has less personality than his Mech AI and basically barely changes. That would be bearable if it hadn\u2019t been for Amy and her lolies always after Ledo\u2026 it truly ruined any hope of me taking Gargantia seriously. The hands down greatest Character in Gargantia is Pinion. He is the show\u2019s greatest saving grace. He is a Mechanic who has a tragic past and wants to bring forth the dreams of those who died in his past. Not to spoiler, but he is witty, brash, and lovable, a real Han solo \u2026. Who on top of this is also an engineer.  He bumps up muddled characters from dismal hate to a\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall I didn\u2019t Hate Gragantia\u2026 didn\u2019t like it either.  It had one thing to keep my attention. \u201cWhen will it be Gen Urobuchied?\u201d For you who have watched Gen you know what im saying. When the world turns upside-down for the main characters and everything goes to hell. This never truly happens in Gargantia, it hints and almost looks like it, but lol nope you get nothing. Garagantia I would not recommend to anyone, it really is only worth watching if you want to see what Gen Urobuchi\u2019s \u201chealing\u201d anime looks like (not good in my o- Pinion bad pun is bad). The only enjoyment was hope enjoyment for everything to go to hell, which sadly never came.

If I wanted to watch episodes of people talking for a full episode I would watch Bakemontagari, if you are actually going to watch this crap then go see Bakemontagri instead because this anime basically has pointless conversations and are plain boring. There is no action and the only mecha action lasts less than about 10 minutes of the whole anime i would say.\r\nThe anime starts off as your average Gundam anime with humans fighting for their lives against their swon enemies Hidiaazu. \r\nThe only good things about thisanime would be the 1st episode which is actually interesting, from there everything goes down hill and you will be skipping practically full episodes because nothing interesting happens. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no visible story progression, here's whats happend.\\n\\n\r\nFighting hidiaazu in space, land on earth for whatever reason, become accustomed with the primitive sailors who tell him NOT to kill pirates who would do the same to them. The 3rd or so fighting scene where the main fleet is under attack Ledo is ordered to not harm a single enemy and he doesn't. \\n\\n\r\nThere are multiple boring episodes filled with nothing but Ledo having to do boring stuff for a party, one of the recent episodes is literally 20 minutes of a vice captain crying and what not over her superiors death.\\n\\n\r\nI can't comprehend what's interesting about this anime. The only good thing is the artwork.",

            "content": "I start writing this review with absolutely no idea what score to give to Suisei no Gargantia. By the time I finish writing, I hope I can come to a conclusive result. Here I go.\r\nSuisei no Gargantia (or Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet) is a show that starts with an interesting set up. Using one sentence to summarize, it is the story of Ledo, a soldier from an advanced, war-dehumanized society, who is stranded in the technologically backward world of Earth, where the \"original\" humans live. \r\n- - - Sound - - -\r\nThe sound is not bad, but no aspect of it really stands out.It receives an average score of 7/10.\\n\\n\r\n- - - Art - - -\\n\r\nThe background artwork is quite amazing. The character design is good. When there is mecha action, the animation is satisfying. On the other hand, it is animated in an uninspiring fashion. I found the animation itself boring especially during the first half of the anime.\\n\r\nReceives a score of 8/10.\\n\\n\r\n- - - Story - - -\\n\r\nThe first half of anime essentially depicts how Ledo learns about Earth, dealing with various cultural shocks in a daily basis. The lack of humor, static animation, and cliched characters make it really hard for me to watch through these episodes. Fortunately, there are two good characters during this time period, Ledo and Amy.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of anime improves drastically in my opinion. This is where all the plot twists happen. I won't spoil anything here, but I personally liked the twists. Furthermore, it delves into some moral and philosophical questions. Although I won't be calling them deep by any means, it does not seem overly childish nor seem inappropriate in its context.\\n\\n\r\nLike some other reviewers said, Suisei no Gargantia suffers from a bad case of identity crisis. The themes in first and latter halves of anime are different. The failure in first half (although it is necessary to the plot) prevented it from being a greater work than it is. \\n\\n\r\nThus, even with an excellent ending, it can only receive a score of 7.5/10 from me.\\n\\n\r\n- - - Character - - -\\n\r\nWhile the character cast as a whole really sucks, there are a few characters who really shine. Amy was decently portrayed, even though she could use much more screen time. Pinion transformed from a stereotypical character to a more interesting character by the end of story. Ledo, the protagonist, undoubtedly shows the most growth throughout the story. However, there is one individual that rise above all others and become so mother-fucking bad-ass cool and was as entertaining as hell to watch, that he alone saves the show from being (below) average. \\n\\n\r\nAnd he is not even human?!\\n\\n\r\nYou've guessed it. It's the Ledo's support interface system, Chamber. \\n\\n\r\nWhy, you may ask?\\n\r\nHis off-handed, machine-like analysis of human society is (arguably) the only source of comic relief in the entire anime, and it is actually well done. \\n\\n\r\n**Spoiler Alert**\\n\\n\r\nMoreover,\\n\r\nHe shows just about as much growth (strangely enough for a machine) as Ledo, if not even more. This is symbolically illustrated in the end by his self-less sacrifice, when he willingly defies the first rule of support interface system. Here are his final words:\\n\r\n\"He (Ledo) needs no support. There is no room for more enlightenment. Now, after I eliminate the barriar that blocks his road ahead, my mission will be completed.\\n\r\nGo to Hell. Tin Can!\"\\n\\n\r\nEpic. Just Epic. Chamber will forever go down as one of the coolest machine character in anime ever.\\n\\n\r\nAfter balancing the goods from the bads, Character section receives a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\n- - - Enjoyment - - -\\n\r\nI was able to really enjoy this anime in the last 5 episodes, where the pacing and mood drastically changes. I thoroughly disliked the few episodes in the middle. \\n\r\n7/10.\\n\\n\r\n- - - Overall - - -\\n\r\n7.5/10 would be the most fitting score from me, but if I had to round this number off, it would be 7/10.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Suisei no Gargantia (Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet is too damn long) is a series I wish I\u2019d have picked up during its season. You like mechs? It\u2019s got that. You like skimpily dressed underage girls? It\u2019s got that too. You like the open sea? Well, you're in luck! On the surface I couldn\u2019t seem to find any redeeming qualities about it and I put it down for a couple months. CG in mecha anime is something I\u2019ve grown to hate (having grown up watching mecha anime) and itwas no different this time, but I sort of became desensitized to it so it stopped mattering after 5 or so episodes, but some of you may view it as unforgivable. One amazing thing about the series is its ability to tell such a big story in such a short amount of time, so major props there Gen Urobuchi, you surprised me with another one of your works.\\n\\n\r\nGargantia is far from perfect, but it handles its human (and not so human) characters really well (some of them) and its action is ok (when it\u2019s all CG) and despite the flaws it still manages to be charming. The history and mythos of the story is handled in such a way that you don\u2019t really know everything and you\u2019re learning as you go along, which is nice. You get to experience the discoveries with the people involved. The characters don\u2019t feel like cut and paste clich\u00e9s (despite what I initially thought) and they actually grow as a result of the events in series. Overall it\u2019s an alright watch for 13 episodes. Something to pick up in your spare time if you\u2019re between series.\\n\\n\r\nI will say though, the CG may turn off any of you purists out there. If that\u2019s enough to scare you off it\u2019s not worth it.\\n",

            "content": "Gargantia\u2019s opening fight sequence in space is dazzling - despite lack of investment, as we have only just met our archetypical characters \u2013 unfortunately the animation goes downhill from there and our investment grows only slightly. \r\nOnce we reach Earth a majority of the action is in the water and Gargantia suffers in comparison to the similarly water-based anime, Free!, released in the same year, who\u2019s animation of the water is beautifully realised. The sense of scale is also absent, its bizarre because I\u2019m not quite sure what\u2019s wrong with it, but the depth of the Earth now covered in water, or the magnitude ofbattles between fleets is not felt. In terms of artwork, there are nice touches in the character details, one example being the tanned and slightly sunburned shoulders and cheeks of Amy. \\n\\n\r\nGargantia\u2019s strength is in its concept, but is poorly explored after it is introduced in the first few episodes. In the spirit of great sci-fi, the anime speculates on interesting themes. But the questions raised are immediately answered by an A.I logic-based mecha, Chamber. Our fish out of water, Ledo, doesn\u2019t learn anything, he accepts Chamber\u2019s dictations and deductions. With themes undebated and efficiently dealt with, Gargantia sustains itself on periodically delivered twists, which make for a watchable but ultimately unsatisfying experience.  \\n\\n\r\nThe variety in the ensemble cast makes up for the bland-by-design lead and supports the theme of team-work. The community is celebrated and frequently threatened but presented as a sort of charming, idealistic, \u2018everyone does their bit!\u2019 utopia. \\n\\n\r\nGargantia has a lot to offer in its concept, variety of themes and a genre-combo. Yet these things are only introduced and poorly executed with the show surviving on twists, an ensemble cast and attempts at speculative sci-fi. \\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nInitially I decided not to watch Gargantia because of the score. But after a personal recommendation from another friend, I decided to watch it through; I'm glad I did. I thought the anime was an enjoyable ride with some forgivable flaws and thus, in light of some of the lower review scores this anime got, I felt compelled to give my take on it.\r\nAs a reminder, reviews are meant to guide people's choice, and can be a mixture of personal opinions, biases, preferences as well as critique (i.e. reviews are not always right (including this one), etc). Ill list some personal biasesbelow as an fyi; but regardless if you agree or not; I'm hoping you will consider reading this review in full:\\n\\n\r\n1. I like Gen Urobuchi's works\\n\r\n2. I find detailed, realistic world-building difficult (and thus commendable)\\n\r\n3. I like sci-fi; harder SF when possible\\n\r\n4. Given how hard it is to come up with truly original ideas, I think 'cliche' or 'trope-y' setups are tolerable if they are executed well or have a reasonable amount of twists on the copied formula.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, Ill try my best to be fair. But before we get started, also note that there may be 'potential' spoilers, as this is my first time writing a review. \\n\\n\r\nLets start off on why I believe the show got lower ratings from some reviews:\\n\\n\r\n1. Complex story is too short for 1 cour\\n\r\n2. Characterization and character development was limited to the MC, his sidekick, and one other character. There was a bit of character inconsistency near the end.\\n\r\n3. The majority of sci-fi plot twists were executed near the end, and worked against the story; making it more cliche and predictable.\\n\r\n4. Execution of merging sci-fi slice of life with mecha action is an honorable endeavor, but it was not merged well; the show literally switched genres half way through the series, which could alienate initial viewers who were hoping for one of the two types of shows.\\n\\n\r\nNow some of the good points; and explains of both good and bad points will follow after:\\n\\n\r\n1. I thought the world building was detailed and mostly made sense; the characters' personalities mostly fit the each of their situations; until up to the half of the series and as the series hastened to its end.\\n\\n\r\n2. Sound and art are important too me; but I guess in this aspect, I'm not as picky (as opposed to the story). I also probably lack artistic knowledge and audiophile knowledge. That being said I thought both were ok. The mechs were animated well; and the CG was not terribly distracting. Colors were bright, vibrant and merged well. The ships details were decent and creative, while remaining reasonably grounded in reality or the sci-fi rules/constructs of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, the negative first point can be pretty much used to argue the remaining negative points. Whether Gargantia had to wrap up quickly due to money, politics, or other concerns, it seemed clear to me that the story dramatically sped up during the 2nd half of the series. The grandiose story that Gargantia was trying to achieve, cannot fit within 1 cour in my opinion. Slice of life genres generally have a slower pace, and thus the slice of life 'arc' of the first half consumed too much episode time, while only building up the main characters a certain amount and supporting characters a negligible amount. Additionally, some viewers likely saw settled into the mindset that this would be a slice of life; that became the expectation. \\n\\n\r\nWhen the 2nd arc of the series started, the genre switch was probably too jarring for certain viewers; thus alienating them. Sci-fi action/mecha watchers may have also left the series by this time, thinking it was just a slice of life show. Additionally, by switching to a darker, action mecha setup, a lot of supporting character development had to be 'discarded' imo in order to be able to use the remaining episodes to support/build up/explain the remaining plot twists that would follow. Inconsistencies with certain characters' actions also had to be used to propel the plot at the speed necessary to end the show in 13 episodes. Had the show had more episodes, then there would be more time to develop more characters, and to transition character personalities in a more natural, subtle manner. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Gargantia was OK because it had a decent, done-before sci-fi story with decent plot twists done in a decent manner (albeit a bit predictable). IMO, what prevented it from being amazing was not blending the slice of life and action mecha genres early enough before viewers' expectations of the show hardened and lacking the number of episodes it needed to do realize its story. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "*This is a review of just the first season of Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet (Suisei no Gargantia).\r\nGargantia on the Verdurous Planet (Suisei no Gargantia) was another show that I found while digging around through different genres of anime late last year. When I found this series, I hadn\u2019t heard anything especially good about it so I wasn\u2019t in any rush to watch it. But this summer I found out that it had been dubbed, and, since I didn\u2019t have any particular anime that I was interested watching at the time, I decided to give it a chance. Unfortunately, Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet wasn\u2019tas good as I thought it would be.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place in the far off future when humans have already left Earth. These people joined together to form the Galactic Alliance in order to combat a race known as the Hideauz. During one of their many battles, Ledo, one of the main characters, is sucked into a black hole along with his machine caliber (mecha) Chamber and lands on ship called long abandoned planet of Earth. While still unconscious he is picked up by the salvagers from the Gargantia Fleet. Shortly after he awakes, he meets the other main character, Amy, and their story begins. The main issue with the story is that suffers from a sort of identity crisis. The series can never really decide whether it wants to be an action, sci-fi series, or a romantic, slice of life series. In the beginning the action was only contributing to the story, but by the end it was guiding it. The series doesn\u2019t do a great job of mixing the genres, and it makes the series feel a little off. For example, at the very beginning of the series you are thrown straight into a massive action sequence, followed by a smaller but still fast paced action sequence, and lots of character interaction. The first few episodes work in a similar way. They give some information about the characters, and life on Earth then mix in some short action scenes. There are also a few episodes in the middle where there is little to no action, and a lot of character interaction. And there are also some episodes, near the end that are very action driven. This not only causes the tone of the show to change, it also shifts the tone of the individual episodes, and it just doesn\u2019t feel right. The problem isn\u2019t the action or slice of life elements themselves, because individually they are both well done. It\u2019s the weird mixture of the two that doesn\u2019t work. I really wish that the action took a back seat to slice of life elements because that was when the show was the most interesting. The main characters have literally grown up worlds apart, and they are both slowly learning the way each other\u2019s society\u2019s work. Through character interactions Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet compares and contrasts different philosophies and worldviews, from having to adapt to other societies needs and ideologies, to the value of human life. That was the most unique and interesting thing that happened in the entire story. The story does throw in a major plot twist in the second half that actually surprised me, but it was ruined by one of the most predictable and clich\u00e9 endings I\u2019ve seen in a while. The series would\u2019ve been a lot better if it had focused more on one specific genre. I personally think this would\u2019ve a really good slice of life anime, and it also would\u2019ve been better off, and felt much more consistent, if it was more action focused.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this series is really well done. The characters are well defined and the backgrounds are also well done. The series uses a lot of bright and vibrant colors that help it to feel inviting and warm. The actions scenes are also well animated, and entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet is very well done. The music fits the atmosphere and tone of the scenes that they are used in really well. A lot of the songs that are used feel epic and grand, and would be entertaining to listen to all by themselves. The soundtrack is complimented by a solid opening and ending, that while not amazing, are still both really good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this series are likeable, but nothing special. The only character that gets a good amount of background information and development is Ledo. We get to see how this stoic child soldier adapts from a life run by his commanding officer, to life on Earth. He, as a main character, is given a lot of time on screen to establish his motivations and give his character development. Amy, the other main character in this series, is the only character that is given anywhere near as much time on screen as Ledo. And unfortunately we aren\u2019t given much information about her, and she doesn\u2019t get much development.

            "content": "Gen Urobuchi is a pretty well-known name in the world of anime-lovers at this point due to his writing for shows such as Fate/Zero, Psycho Pass and Madoka Magica, and anyone who has seen multiple of these shows knows that Urobuchi has a distinct set of ideals that seep their way into every story he tells. Namely, Urobuchi is concerned with the value of the good of society compared to the value of the erratic, self-serving individual. Urobuchi places the highest of values on individuality and personal expression, and this is usually very obvious in his stories which often involve Utilitarian antagonists and glorify thenonsensical yet beautiful actions of their protagonists. His ideas are fascinating, and I can especially see their relevance in regards to modern Japanese culture which pushes for conformity and refuses to value those not useful to society. Suisei no Gargantia, or \"Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet\" is a very straightforward reflection of those ideals, making the struggle of a soldier brought up in a utilitarian empire that values results and the efficiency of humanity above all else the centerpiece of its story.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Gargantia isn't at its best when its indulging in its utilitarian debates and sparring its mechas against each other. Where Gargantia succeeds best, even when compared to Urobuchi's other shows, is when it's demonstrating the value of the other side of the equation, the beauty of individualism, the worth of the aspects of life other than results, the dysfunctional charm of a civilization that doesn't operate entirely through logic, instead placing importance on revels and relaxation and experiences and beauty. More than anything Gargantia is a BEAUTIFUL show: the art is astounding, capturing the feeling of a tropical beach at sunset or the life and energy of the open sea with gorgeous, fluid animation, using purples and reds and blues and browns to bring a teeming world to life. The characters move fluidly and glow with energy, and the attention to detail in the civilization of Gargantia is outstanding: everything from the clothing to the buildings to the food works together to create an atmosphere that is absolutely delicious. It's a joy just to look at Gargantia, to listen to its slow, enchanting soundtrack and enjoy the astounding glory and vicariousness of its world.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself isn't necessarily Urobuchi's best. It's not especially original, both in its ideas and execution, and it's rather predictable, but despite its simple nature it's still endearing and is compelling enough just in the way that it's done even if it's not bringing anything that new to the table. Expect some basic utilitarian debates and a conflict that revolves around an individual struggling to discover his own sense of self after having been denied it for so long. Urobuchi's stories are also usually a cut above must of the anime being produced, so despite being one of his more straightforward and simplistic works Gargantia is far from bland or boring. It may not have the convoluted intensity of Fate/Zero or the mystery of Madoka, but it's concise and well-paced and as a whole it feels satisfying. I don't think more episodes would have benefited Gargantia: part of its charm is the brevity of the series, giving you a glance into a world and leaving just enough up to the imagination to allow the viewer to take part in the experience.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the story really suffers, however, is the characterization. Urobuchi is good at crafting the ideas behind characters, but where he oftentimes suffers is in his attempts to bring those characters to life in small and relatable ways. He's pretty much the antithesis to Kyoto Animation, relying on the central core of a character and their motivations to be the driving force behind the audience's investment in them, rather than showing us that they behave like a person. This issue manifests itself in varying degrees in all of his shows, sometimes being virtually non-existant and usually being nothing more than a minor nuisance, but in Gargantia it is BAD. There's no chemistry between any of the characters: banter is virtually non-existent, people talk as if they are having their lines pulled out of a hat of cheesy one-liners, and essential personable moments are scrapped for exposition and plot advancement at every turn. The supporting cast is especially bad, as we never get to understand them much through their motivations and therefore rely almost exclusively on the small hints they drop during conversation in regards to their personalities. When all of these conversations are bland and cliche there's really not much to learn, and aside from skewering emotional investment it can make the show actively difficult to watch at times. The main cast isn't nearly as bad, but they aren't enough to make up for the incredible amount of time spent with characters that seem to have been made with a cookie cutter. It isn't the end of the world: the ideas behind the important characters do carry them and there are a few good moments here and there but overall this is my one big complaint with the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhether or not you want to watch Gargantia is up to you. The most compelling reason I have to recommend it is that it is short and outstandingly gorgeous. It's the show's mellow, oftentimes wordless (thank god) downtime that makes it worth watching, and its the episodes spent just enjoying the beauty of Gargantia that are the most rewarding. It's also a fun, cute story with a solid and endearing conclusion. However, as someone who finds it difficult to watch terrible dialogue I can completely understand anyone choosing to skip this one. I had a good time with it, but this was definitely first and foremost a piece of entertainment, and it didn't always succeed at that.",

I actually did not watch it at first,but my friend recommended it to me and yea, gave it a shot. To my amazement it was amazing.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe series started off with this guy called Ledo, a soldier in the galactic thingy. After they retreated,his commander died, he was late for the travel back, thus drifted off into space. Guess what? It landed on earth! At first look, It is a landless piece of junk.............. but then he met this girl Amy so on and forth.\r\nEpisode 9 had a reportin it,which shows how was earth last time,the evolvers and so on. At first you would not know what is going on but it all makes sense in episode 9.\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters were amazing! Luckily there is no hero-like feel in them or else i will drop the anime....Forget about that. Ledo was a soldier,loves killing..... HOWEVER. After episode 9, It shows that he has feelings!\\n\r\nChamber,Just a typical robot...military robot to be precise. I am not going to talk about all the other characters though.\\n\r\nArt: 9/10:\\n\r\nWhy? They didn't draw the girls well enough...\\n\r\nSound:10/10\\n\r\nI love the Opening and Ending! As well as the OST! \\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10\\n\r\nI enjoy everything about it so far... but the character design of the girls bug me...\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nGood anime with smart twists!",

            "content": "\"One who abandons thought and decision making deviates from the core definition of being human.\" - Chamber\r\nExistentialism is a common topic in media. It's explored to great extent in some deeply philosophical shows, and more shallowly in others. Seldomly, however, does a show experience a massive paradigm shift in tone and with such a revelatory moment as in Gargantia, and make it flow almost effortlessly into the narrative. While that makes Gargantia sound really heavy- it does double duty as a nice little Slice of Life and a twisting drama in terms of narrative.\r\nArtwork and Animation: 8\r\nProduction IG delivers a great looking product in Gargantia.Very vibrantly colored with lots of blues (since it's set on the endless oceans) contrasting well with the rusty reds of the ships, and interesting character designs, with their choice of dress. A lot of the Gargantian dress is very American Indian inspired, while the Galactic Alliance draws influence from sci-fi military wear. \\n\r\nI enjoyed the vibrant setting of Gargantia: as stated above, Gargantia sports a lot of great coloration and some unique setpieces, given that it's set entirely on the ocean. Sea creatures, lighting effects, and the overall post-apocalyptic feel with the rusty, aged looking cobbled together fleet- their technology, with the general look of retro futurism, is also rather cool to see. As with anything Production IG does nowadays, there's the inclusion of 3D CGI, and in Gargantia it does look good. They have improved on their mecha work from Guilty Crown, and I have to say, their movements never drew my ire as most 3D does. \\n\r\nRealistic detail touches like the sky being dense with stars at night are cool to see in use here, since the Earth has no lights on it to pollute the atmosphere.\\n\r\nThe character movements are fluid as ever- IG does excel in making their characters move like real people. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory, Characters: 8, 7\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to say too much, since the late season twist is what solidified this show as a good watch for me, but, I do want to talk about the aforementioned existentialist conflict that's set up in the show. Ledo is but a single worker ant in the spacefaring, far future colony of humanity. Due to reasons that would be spoilertastic to explain, humanity had long before abandoned the Earth to make their way in space, and were eventually able to thrive, but only through an intensely regimented life devoid of any concept we recognize of living. The humans are pressed into military service from a young age, and like lab rats, any with genetic disabilities or illnesses are culled. There is no concept of family or friends, there is no currency system- everyone is rationed their minimum allotted amount of clothing, food, and shelter, and nothing more. The only escape from this laborious existence is after X years of military service, they're allowed to vacation for a month on Avalon: a manmade planet-sized space station that travels through space. \\n\\n\r\nThe Galactic Alliance of humans, far removed from any internal squabbles they may once have had, is run like a fascist/authoritarian dictatorship. Orders are handed down from above and are to be carried out immediately, without question, or the offending soldier would be immediately removed from service, if not killed on the spot. People are merely cogs in a machine, easily interchangeable with another if they fail to perform their duties to the utmost degree.\\n\\n\r\nLedo, who, during a battle with humanity's spacefaring enemy, the Hideauze (pr. He-day-owz) gets separated from his fleet during a strategic withdrawal through a wormhole creator (not unlike the Mass Relays from the Mass Effect series) is launched through time and space, and ends up on a foreign planet, of which there is no record in his Machine Caliber (a humanoid shaped robot with an advanced AI technology known as Chamber inside). \\n\r\nThis planet is known as Earth. \\n\\n\r\nEarth is now completely covered in water for reasons I cannot disclose here, and humanity survives on enormous city-sized fleets of cobbled together ships resurrected from the ocean floor- the largest of these known as Gargantia. The humans aboard this ragtag group of ships live a very communal, easygoing life, starkly juxtaposed to the rigid order and structure of the GA military. \\n\\n\r\nOn Earth, Ledo is met with a mix of awe and suspicion from the denizens of Gargantia, who are loath to allow him into their society, but begrudgingly accept him for the usefulness of his animated mechanized machine. Ledo meets a young girl named Amy, who takes an interest in him, and serves as his guide in this alien environment, and go between for him and the commanders of Gargantia. This sets up the discovery, mutual learning and slice of life moments between Ledo, Amy, and the crew of Gargantia. It's done so that the audience, through the eyes of Ledo, learns much about the history of the Earth, and its now-inhabitants, and at the same time revealing through Ledo what it really means to live a life. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe foreshadowed moment late in the season totally changes the dynamic of the show, from what was a very cute and easygoing Slice of Life to a darkly consequential drama, like an astonishing kick to the head wake up call. I would put this moment in the neighborhood of the twist of Fight Club or The Sixth Sense- a slow buildup to an unsuspecting mindblowing moment. \\n\\n\r\nAnother interesting philosophical point brought up is the dogma of the Alliance, vs the mentality of the Gargantians. Per the Alliance, the weak in society exist solely to support and provide for the strong, who in turn protect the weak in a sort of twisted symbiosis- this is countered in the Gargantian view of a supportive familial type structure, where everyone has something to offer that's not a binary \"weak/strong\" dynamic. One could call this the idea of socialism or even communistic, but those aren't really the purpose behind it. The disparity between the societies presented in the show creates an interesting dynamic that's explored through the conflict- and one that was a lot of fun to watch unfold and unravel. \\n\\n\r\nAs a product of Gen Urobuchi, one would expect twists and turns, but this was definitely one I enjoyed a lot. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nGargantia was a big surprise for me. It started slowly, and it was an interesting concept- the \"alien meets earth\", but with a twist. A nice commentary on the human condition, as well- with the inversely analogous perspectives on the purpose of life from the Gargantians and the Galactic Alliance.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"According to the GA philosophy, happiness is the realization of circumstance in which the individual's service unto the entire group makes the cost benefit ratio most efficient. Therefore, happiness is commensurate with a degree of command stability\" -Striker",

I mean Water World... wait that's not it! I mean Gargantia... yeah! that's the one... \\n\\n\r\nThe story was a roller-coaster and the inhabitants of the setting felt very fleshed out and like they were really part of a living breathing world. The Protagonist Ledo was bland and emotionless, but in a way that his purpose for having such a personality made sense and the subtle changes to his character over time felt relevant and welcome.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals in this show were gorgeous with a shout out to the pseudo tribal culture bringing nostalgia of previously mentioned Final Fantasy X or Monster Hunter to mind reminding me just how easy I am to please with the appropriate levels of asceticism and comfy. The CG was a bit rough but wasn't the worst however it definitely cost the show some points in places.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the shows first half was a comfy tribal ocean cruise and just when you start wondering where this whole ship is sailing plot elements that were scattered throughout each episode come rushing into the last half of the series and things get real serious real fast with some really enjoyable dialogue and action sequences between our protagonist and antagonist. Plot twists abound in this one. Some were predictable while others genuinely surprised me.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end some better timing direction or just MORE of the wonderful world that was provided to me would be the push this show needs to get this into my all time favorite anime range, but what we got simply gives it a slot of \"something very good I'd recommend to anybody.\"\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I have yet to watch the 2 OVA episodes but when I do so will I will probably keep the summary brief or just copy paste this review to it with a disclaimer.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet is a bittersweet show. The world it sets up and the different ideas thrown in are fantastic, but the characters and plot are pretty uninteresting and the anime takes a while before it finally gets to a place where you actually care to watch the story progress. Gargantia is not a bad anime though, just very shallow in depth and lackluster in execution.\r\nLedo is the pilot of a giant robot. He comes from a utopian world in space where he was conscripted to fight against the Hideauze, giant squid creatures that fly around wreaking havoc. During a battle he getssucked into a black hole and taken to what had once been Earth, a planet now completely covered in water that is home to floating cities built on fleets of battleships linked together. The one he ends up on is called Gargantia. He finds himself learning a new language, meeting new people, enjoying new customs, and eventually learning a devastating secret about the Hideauze.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the series is slow, plodding, uninteresting, and just plain boring. It\u2019s pretty enough and I love the idea of the giant fleets of ships being like a floating continent, but its otherwise nothing special. The characters are all boring, even Ledo. There\u2019s a focus on a female protagonist, Amy, who is just\u2026annoying. Her character is nonexistent and all she seems to be good for is wearing very little clothes. In fact, most of the women in this show wear very little clothes. I can understand that it\u2019s hot but the fan service is too bountiful with this harvest. Especially on the festival episode which forces us to watch Amy and her friends dance like gypsies. And this festival comes right after another festival. And then there\u2019s an episode where everyone sits around eating barbecue and gives the female characters an excuse to wear skimpy bikinis.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s the biggest problem with the show is this middle slump of uninspired fan service, boring dialogue, very little character development, and no plot development. A show like this with the very serious tone of the ending could maintain that seriousness throughout and be an especially good anime with an emphasis on perhaps the politics of maintaining the fleet or dealing with more pirates or other fleets of humans. Instead it\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d expect from a lazy show; failed attempts at humor, unneeded and out of place fan service, and nary a reason to exist to be found.\\n\\n\r\nAnd you can argue that these episodes develop the \u201cromance\u201d between Ledo and Amy. But it\u2019s all thinly veiled, generically played out, and uninteresting. As you can probably tell by a lot of my reviews, I want the romance to happen. I love romance in anything because that\u2019s just how I am. It develops characters, it makes the story more relatable, and it leaves you with a good feeling in the end when everything comes out right. But Gargantia\u2019s \u201cromance\u201d is as thin as they come and inconsequential either way. The end plays up Ledo\u2019s devotion to Amy, but it just as well could be the fact he likes Gargantia and the people there just as much as Amy. Even if the ending does show them walking together it really doesn\u2019t establish anything, and even if they kissed it wouldn\u2019t exactly be heartwarming because their characters were never developed enough nor given enough time to gel for it to really work. It\u2019s all forced.\\n\\n\r\nGen the Butcher wrote this so you\u2019d expect a lot more depressing and unhappy philosophy, and you get that toward the end. It does take a mild turn for the worse and a few strange things happen but overall, it\u2019s fairly tame. As I said, toward the end the story picks up and gets good but not because of the characters. It\u2019s all because of the world that is created. Revealing the truth behind the Hideauze, the fact that the people living on the fleets are scavenging stuff from the sea floor to learn more about old humanity, a fleet of people revering a robot as a god. It\u2019s all really compelling ideas that are there but everything else happening plot-wise isn\u2019t exciting. There was never one suspenseful moment in the show because I just didn\u2019t care.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe with a longer series I would have grown to love this show a lot more than I do. With better character development and better plots that gave me a reason to relate to Ledo, a reason to care for the romance with Amy, a reason to want to see Gargantia win its battles, I might have cared more for the series. But as it stands, it\u2019s super shallow with very little in regards to characters, development, or plot. The end has its moments but it ultimately is nothing memorable And I hate to say that because I love the ideas behind the series so much!\\n\\n\r\nBut in the end, it\u2019s just a slightly above average adventure that may not even be worth taking.",

Suisei no Gargantia is more eclectic genre and theme-wise than most mecha anime, adding social and ethnological layers to the setting and interspersing the story with hard sf elements (especially the intellectual evolution of Chamber AI comes to mind as an example). The key features of the series are the \"stranger in a strange land\"element of cultural adaptation, the main character's inner evolution and the theme of utilitarian utopia represented by Gargantia. Therefore, SnG demands some flexibility from the audience it is addressed to.\\n\\n\r\nWonderful music, great pacing and coherent story is what makes this series extraordinary. Some may criticize those few mild fan-service moments in this - rather serious - sf tale, but it just made it more varied and enjoyable in my book.",

And its fine, I have no problem with it, that's his style and he writes masterpieces, like Fate/ Zero, with it. Its just, every-single time I saw something potentially powerful, I thought to myself \"thats the murder weapon.\" And in a way that style is still present, but I am shocked to say thatit was in a much more subtle way.\\n\r\nWithout getting into too many spoilers I will say this is the lighter side of Uro.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a pretty basic \"outsider adapting to society\" plot, with a bit of a mech and pirate twist.\\n\r\nIt did seem at times the author bit off more than he could chew and that everything wouldnt be solved or that so many questions would have been left up in the air my brain would start nagging me while I try to sleep.\\n\r\nI dont like that.\\n\r\nThankfully, there was a pretty dam good wrap-up of what needed to be answer with the right amount of space for a sequel if necessary, though I think its fine the way it ended.\\n\r\nThere really isnt much to say about the animation, it was just beautiful, with  emphasis on how fluid the battle scenes were. I was constantly left with chills after every explosion and even though I did say it was the \"lighter side of Uro,\" thats like saying the lightest whale or the least rabid mongoose, there was plenty of action to get the blood boiling.\\n\r\nThe character development was nice too. You got to see how \"space boy\", as they called him, began adapting to life and how he came to realize the faults of his methodologies.\\n\r\nThe sound was top notch, bar none. I thought the sound track fit the scenarios very well. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of enjoyment, it is something to be enjoyed. The story was unexpectedly light hearted, yet at the same time captivating. The fight scenes from the  beginning phrase that started the conflict to end \"farewell\" statement (those who've seen it know what I mean) are the literal meaning of the word epic. \\n\\n\r\nSome people may not necessarily agree with me at all, but when I talked to other people they said that they would have enjoyed it tons more if they just wouldn't have had that, \"this is written Gen Urobuchi\" mindset.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend it",

            "content": "In my short time watching anime, I've found but one anime with a mech component that amazed me, while keeping all other components in check. The reason being they've never fulfilled my expectations. The stories have been simple and only vaguely interesting. The characters never really had great character development. And the action that every mech is bound to come with never reaches expectations. Now what does Suisei no Gargantia bring to the table other mechs don't? Well allow me to give my opinions on this subject.\r\nLet's start with the story, the basis of any anime. Ledo is a young man who finds himself ina ship fleet, called Gargantia, after falling into a black hole of some sort during a battle against space-squids called the Hideaazu. (And no, this is not a hentai, don't let the artist fool you) After a chain of events triggered by his awakening, Ledo begins to try and understand the societal structure of Gargantia. In this process, the author ignored nothing in detailing how Ledo goes about this. From learning the native language, to getting used to local cuisine, and even to how the inhabitants obtain fresh water, no rock was left unturned.\\n\\n\r\n Now, before you go thinking I'm saying the story is perfect, it's not. Allow me to work backwards first, as that's where a the biggest flaw in the story actually lies. I found that the story lacked in its explaining how people survived on Earth for so long.  In the end, it was said one faction of mankind abandoned the Earth because the sun was about to give out. That said, A) How did people who stayed on Earth survive the sun's destruction, and B) Why is there a sun now? On this one point, they neglect to explain it very well and leave it open to interpretation. Now, back to the beginning of the story. After the first few episodes, the story progresses very slowly in the beginning and makes you wait. A lot. This got on my nerves quite a bit, especially since I know the author's better works and I grew very anxious waiting for the story to actually kick in. Which brings me to the late-story. As I said, I know the author, so I often tried to make predictions of what to expect from the story with friends. However, neither I nor my friends could predict the turn the story took in the latter half of the show. From there, I didn't really know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised and for the first time in a while, I didn't even try to predict what was going to happen in the next episodes. Needless to say, I enjoyed what came next, but it didn't quite cover up that the earlier episodes were more or less unneeded.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto character development. In the beginning, Ledo is a emotionless, unwavering soldier with a giant, futuristic robot that can talk. Yep, this is a mech anime. Ledo usually relies on Amy, a resident of Gargantia who serves as somewhat of a delivery girl, to teach him the ways of the fleet which are almost polar opposites compared to where he lived. Ledo's assimilation is slow and not without blunders, both comical and serious. However, he changes quite considerably from Alliance soldier to Gargantian resident. His mech, Chamber, however, isn't so quick to change. In fact, up until the end of the series, he remains a static character and even hinders Ledo in his assimilation. Notice, I said, \"Up until the end\". The fact that an AI in a show changes at all is interesting, but this was a complete 180 in terms of personality. As for other characters... Meh, not a whole lot to say. For a twelve episode series, the other characters received about as much development as possible.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally the action component. What so great, you may ask. Here's my response. In every other mech anime, aside from a select few, the battles have never met my expectations. It just like watching people fight, except they occasionally have rockets and 12 different machine guns. So what? There isn't really a lot there that humans couldn't do. We can run, we can shoot guns, we can kick, etc. After that, what is there really, in most mech anime, that robots have. Here, in later Suisei, we have flying fighting robots. Okay? So? They have lasers. *Yawn* Alright, here, watch this. The futuristic mechs in Suisei fights are created in ways that I've witnessed in only a few other anime. The art, sound, and animation all flow in perfect harmony to make the battle scenes absolutely amazing. That's something I feel I've seen very few times in mech anime and something that should be a standard for the genre.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to touch on art and sound only briefly because I feel I've addressed them pretty well in just the last paragraph. The art is easily the best aspect of the show and probably the biggest contributor to the amazing battle scenes. Battle scenes aside, character art and scenery a detailed down to the last spec of light reflected off the ocean's surface. Sound, however, would be the least impressive aspect of the show. Don't get me wrong, it's still good. The soundtrack compliments situations nicely, special effects are well done, but there are many other shows that do it a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Suisei no Gargantia is a very good take on a futuristic genre and it's easy to see why it's spoken of highly. I would certainly encourage anyone to watch it, and I myself would watch it again.",

            "content": "It is very easy for young people, teenagers and young adults, to fall into despair. Treading the line between adulthood and childhood can lead to feelings of uselessness, a lack of motivation, insignificance, and an overall questioning of the role one plays in a suddenly larger, colder world. The warm safety of childhood is necessarily left behind, and the comforts of not making important choices fades away to reveal a somewhat terrifying truth: we are all responsible for our own destiny. \r\nSuisei no Gargantia seeks to address some of these problems, and to offer a vision of hope to young people who might feel thatdespair of growing older. And in this, I believe, lies it's greatest strength. It does not protect us from the realities of life: that people die, that sometimes we make the wrong choice, that perhaps our foundations are not correct or are not applicable to our current situation; but at the same time, it does not ask us, the audience, to wallow in a sea of loss.\\n\\n\r\nAt the heart of the show is the main character. Ledo is a child soldier raised in a society that is involved in a war for survival. Some of Ledo's first words are explaining that he has no fear of death, and further that he has no desire for procreation or freedom. His entire existence is defined by his occupation, and his purpose in life is simply to advance the goals of his society. In a great many respects, Ledo represents both the machine and the child. He is a child in that he does not make his own choices,  and does not question the authority and rightness of his \"parents\". He is a machine in that his every action and thought is defined by how it is useful to his people. As much as the mech he pilots, he is just another tool; himself being piloted by the doctrines of his upbringing and the orders of his superiors. \\n\\n\r\nAs Ledo learns to make his own choices and begins defining himself outside of his occupation, we are presented with new themes. And it is in this that we run into what is, in my opinion, Gargantia's greatest flaw. It is not a terrible flaw, but the show suffers slightly from not fully exploring many of the themes that it brings up. It is understandable due to both it's length and it's target audience, but I still believe that there was some room for more involved exploration. However, as I said before, the flaw is minor and does not detract from the show in any meaningful way. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story is basic, but stellar. The characters are interesting, the overall plot intriguing, and the themes and symbolism are mature and well thought out. The pacing and dialogue were both excellent, both used to great effect. And more than anything, the payoffs were there. From the fast-paced beginning to the final scene, the story grabs you and doesn't let go. Some might see the middle of the show as dragging, but when taken as a whole, I believe those more character focused episodes were necessary to develop the relationships of our protagonist and also to give weight to later scenes where the story takes a darker, more brooding tone. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where this anime really shines. I don't know if I can remember seeing such a bright, colorful anime. More than anything, the world looks \"lived in\". Too many science fiction stories have settings that are entirely sterile, where everything is too new, too shiny, too clean. Gargantia is rusty, with heaps of corrugated metal and twisting, winding avenues that run throughout it's length. It would be hard not to say that this show has some of the best artwork I've seen in a long time. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing out of place. The VA's all did a very good job, and the music was fitting. Sound is easy to get right, but when it's wrong, it can ruin everything. Gargantia did it right. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character development was strong, but not perfect. Some of the side characters were slightly unexplored, but overall this was understandable, and no one really comes off as one-dimensional. Ledo and Chamber are both very interesting, very realistic characters; both of them get the 10/10. We feel for them, and most importantly, we can put ourselves in their shoes. I hesitate giving this a 9/10 instead of a perfect score, but feel that though the target audience was younger, there was still some room for more concise, and deeper characterization.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSimply put: the show achieves it's purpose. It is supposed to be a coming-of-age story with an overall sense of healing, and is supposed to evoke a sense of fascination and wonder at the wide world a teenager or young adult will find themselves in. To this, it succeeds wonderfully. Enjoyment is a very personal factor, with no specific metric that can be appealed to, but I feel comfortable in saying that this show will be enjoyed by most who watch it. As long as you keep your expectations where they belong and your mind open, there is nothing that should drive anyone but the most cynical away. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really want to give this the 10/10, and perhaps upon a second viewing I will change my score. As of now, I feel that calling it a masterpiece would be too much though. The show is amazing in so many ways, and definitely has moments where it shines brighter than a lot of more popular, more highly rated shows; but at the end of the day, it has it's flaws. They are minor, and do not necessarily detract anything from the show, and every one of them has justification; but still they exist. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this to anyone and everyone. Watch it. Even if you don't enjoy it as much as I did, you will almost certainly not regret giving it a shot.",

            "content": "I once saw an edited comic picture of Gen Urobochi holding Mami Tomoe's head with a line \"It's time for me to recognize as a healing-type writer!\" and there's a kid on the floor shouting \u201cNo, Gen No!\u201d... Well, considering the works Gen has written before, Saya no Uta, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Fate Zero and Psycho-pass. I guess you can't really blame them if that's their reaction\r\nNow if you are wondering if Gen Urobochi can really write a story like this. \r\nSuisei no Gargantia is the answer to it.\r\nThere's a reason why Gen Urobochi is one the most popular writers right now. It\u2019s becausehe knows all of negative things in this world (well if not, almost all) and that's the very reason why he can write great stories. Now what's the connection of this to healing-type stories? \\n\r\nIt\u2019s because he knows how to correct all of these negative things.\\n\\n\r\nI'm writing this review to make Suisei no Gargantia receive the credits that it should deserved. It got a lot of messages, it got a lot of lessons and I think it\u2019s time for Gen Urobochi to be known as one of the best story writers, not just because of his dark twisted plots but simply because he's great in telling a story.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review and I'll try what I can so I won\u2019t spoil the story as much as possible.\\n\\n\r\nSuisei no Gargantia starts off with space battle between Mechas and space living creatures they called Hideauze. So you'll get this feeling \"What the hell is happening in here?\u201d There's no background what is this war about. You got flying mechas with a lot of lasers, thousands of enemies that look like snails and octopus. Both sides are killing each other with all they have. The script even feels forced just to make the battle make sense. But all of these are part of the grand plot of this anime. You've got Silver Link, Xebec, JC Staff, Studio DEEN, Gainax, and Production I.G. With the biggest companies in anime collaborating in this series, you know what to expect. They'll give you the details of what is happening to the last drop. Vivid colours, detailed information + smooth animation. You can't ask for more. \\n\\n\r\nHad you ever seen how marvelous nature is? Burning sunset dyed with many shades of red, crystal ocean that clearly reflects the surface above it, Auroras dancing in the skies with its brilliants colours.\\n\r\nSuisei no Gargantia represented all of it, right in front of your eyes. Add the ambiance of water then put a background music on it, when the story flows you'll find yourself inside the setting itself to the point you can feel the waves of the ocean as if you're in a ship.\\n\\n\r\nShips? Oceans? Why are those things in here?\\n\r\nAfter that what-the-hell-is-that-war-for, Ledo the male main character our story encountered a problem in entering the portal while they are trying to retreat and because of that he was warped in a completely different place with his Mecha, Machine Caliber K6821, Chamber (remember his name well). And their destination would be, Earth\\n\\n\r\nTo those who we're able to watched Water World, a film from 1995, you'll see many similar things in here. The Earth had become a planet completely submerge in water. The people who remained in this planet now live in ships. Since resources are very limited, they help and support each other. With the biggest one at the center, ships are linked to each other forming a fleet, this is the Gargantia. Ledo and Chamber were saved by the people of this fleet.\\n\\n\r\nSo we got a space kid who knows nothing except war, in a big ship where everyone treats each other as a family. This is where the story starts and it will begin from scratch. The language space people are using is entirely different from the language of the residents of Gargantia. And since they can't understand each other, hostility was the first answer that Ledo found so he can ensure his safety. \\n\r\nIn front of other people you know nothing of, who is showing resistance as well as you do. What is the right thing to do?\\n\r\nIf you have something to protect, and if you want to draw the line so others would respect what is important to you, what are the things that you can do and the things that you can't?\\n\r\nLedo only knows how to follow orders and execute them, at first he can't fit at all with all these new rules. And as he slowly learns their language and adjusts to this new environment, he questions the system of Gargantia because the only conclusion he can draw on how the people lives in this fleet is inefficient. This is one of the best parts of the series as Ledo experiences the things that he wasn't able to when he was in space. And by doing so he discovered something so important within himself that he had lost a long time ago.\\n\r\nWhat it means to be a leader, governing all the people who appointed you in that position. How will you lead them so they can feel safe and keep the group going? There\u2019s a limit to what a single person can do.\\n\r\nAs the story unfolds it will boil down to where it all began. Ledo discovers the very origin of their enemies, the Hideauze. And it\u2019s is far way off to what he thought. The things that he has been doing in space, the reason why he is fighting, the things that he thought are right. Everything came crumbling.\\n\r\nNow that everything has gone wrong, what is he going to do next? Can he still correct the things that he had done? And what will be the price of it if he wants to?\\n\r\nThe answer to all of these. Is in this series. \\n\\n\r\nA grand 10 out of 10 for story no question about it. A lot of things in here can be connected to our society. \\n\r\nMusic, I'll use comparative rating in here by basing the perfect score to the best I know (Kajiura Yuki, and Jun Maeda composed) and I'll give Gargantia 9 for their music. \\n\r\nAnimation, Chamber himself is drawn to the finest detail and the gigantic fleet of Gargantia has a very complex design. Just imagine a birds-eye-view overlooking a town while everything is moving. Suisei no Gargantia offers the best view points as you explore each section of the fleet with all the details on it. What more could you ask for if there\u2019s a battle scene, a perfect 10 for the animation.\\n\r\nCharacters, once again I'll use comparative rating, it\u2019s true that Suisei no Gargantia only has 13 episodes and compared to other anime exceeding hundreds of episodes it got very limited time for character developments but hey don't forget that Gen Urobochi is here. The characters struggles in finding the answer was so much, it\u2019s enough to make their beliefs turn upside down when they found the truth. And once they have this new found answer, they\u2019ll push through and pick a decision, and that decision is the right decision. For the characters of Suisei no Gargantia, 9 out of 10.\\n\r\nEnjoyment, from Ledo's broken Nihongo, Chamber's all reasonable insulting comebacks, the peaceful days they spent in Gargantia, to the point that they might lose everything they have. Suisei no Gargantia will make you fully appreciate how great things would be if we are all just working together because it will show you how bad it could get if we are not. I'll rate it 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'll give 10 for Suisei no Gargantia. My first impression about the 1st half of episode 1 completely changes when I repeated it. I was trembling and nearly cried because now I know the reason why they are fighting. From creating something you knew nothing of, support that you receive while you are trying to build it and when you finally find something precious that you can protect, someone will trample it and this someone is a person similar who you used to be. The Legend of this Verdurous Planet is one of the best stories that I know.\\n\\n\r\nThe series was aired in Japan from April 17 to June 30, 2013.\\n\r\nFor those who wasn't able to watch it yet. You don\u2019t want to miss this series. I'm suggesting you follow the 3 episodes rule for the first three episodes, after that you can stop at any episode but once you got to episode 9, finish watching it up to the end. I'm highly recommending the translation works of UTW-Vivid.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading and I'll try to write a review for the OVA of Suisei no Gargantia next time.\\n\r\nI hope you'll enjoy the series~!",

My first impression was that the deep space animation of the battles with the mechas was inferior to that of Knights Of Sidonia which was quite similar but also superior to this anime. After seeing the opening scenes I felt that I would give up after 1 maybe 2 episodes but after Ledo finds himself on earth the show  picks up! I was quite a fan of the animation and liked the designs of the character and Chamber who I thought looked very cool. Thestory develops as it goes along giving the reasons for the existence of the hidiaazu's which leads to Ledo questioning his reasons for being a soldier. I do admit there were some parts where the story was infact quite weak such as how Ledo does nothing for half the show but sit there and sulk about having nothing to do (also how Striker acts on its own to fight Ledo and Chamber? I wasn't a fan of that) Also I wanted Ledo and Amy to kiss! To my dismay they did not. Overall a good anime to enjoy when you have nothing else to do during the holidays. (Ledo is also a cutie)",

            "content": "Urobuchi Gen is without doubt an author that is known. That of course isn't for no reason. His preference to kill characters you like and let everyone go through incredible pain is spread quite wide by now. With Madoka Magika and Fate/Zero being his two best known works, that sure doesn't help him to get rid of this reputation. And along comes Suisei no Gargantia. A Mecha Anime written by the Urobucher himself.\r\nStory: The story is set in the far future, when mankind left earth due to climatic circumstances, that lead to the earth being completely covered with ice. Now humankind is battling flowerlike creaturescalled Hideauze in space, using mechas to extinct them. In one battle the young soldier Ledo gets sucked into a wormhole and gets to a planet completely covered with water, where people live on huge fleets, not knowing of others living in space and seeming to be pretty much left behind in techonology.\\n\r\nThe story itself is mostly about Ledo adapting to the way people live on the world that he now is in. This certainly is not a Urobuchi like show. While I did enjoy the story of it, it was not what I expected and it felt like everyone was just waiting for the dark plot twist to happen. The twist came and he was as good as expected but it didn't go into the dark direction after that either. This being said, it still is not a bad story, just surprising.\\n\r\nIn total the story stayed pretty long at the basic concept of adapting to a new life style, but when the pacing got faster, it got pretty good, but nothing mind blowing! The ending also wasn't quite satisfying as it was and it could've been executed better!\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The chararcters are the things the show is mostly based on. With the plot moving forward really slow in the beginning, the characters are what carries the show on and that's what they do pretty good. Even later on when the show decides to speed up a lot, the characters still have a major role in bringing the plot forward. The characters are all rather lieable and almost none of the important onesd remain without depht. The only problem I have with this is that the love story we have in here feels a bit rushed. While I do like both characeters involved, it did feel kind of rushed.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: Production I.G. didn't leave us unsatisfied again! The animation of Gargantia was incredible! Everything was fluent (my favourite scene animationwise was the dancing scene :3) and the colors were pretty. The characters being designed by a hentai artist looked gorgeous!\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The Soundtrack of Gargantia was pretty much decent. It mostly fit the scenes quite well and I don't have anything to complain, but it wasn't anything superb. The voice acting was ok as well, but still nothing too special.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Even though most parts of this show were only Ledo adapting to a new lifestyle, the characters were what made it interesting. I found myself really enjoying this even though I was surpriserd to see this kind of story being handled by Urobuchi Gen.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I think Gargantia is a show that can be liked by many, since it is something that has a lot of parts in it, ranging from Slice of Life on the fleet, to action filled battle scenes to some dramatic and darker moments. I like this but it isn't anything outstanding and while being handled quite well, it still has flaws!\\n\r\nAll in all a 8/10",

            "content": "First of all, I am not a mecha lover. I find gundam or other mecha anime make no sense at all. Why? Because there are no way that a low level human civilization would use some robot manually controlled by human from the inside of the robot to fly around and destroy things. It is inefficient in more than one reason. From the limitation of earth's metal chemical structure, the gravity issue, and the energy consumption. It's pretty much mechanical fantasy with non sense concept of logic. I can't seem to think that it is cool just because it looks badass. For me, if it'scalled as mecha anime, it should be scientifically make sense. \\n\\n\r\nBUT THIS ANIME! This is what a anime with non remote controlled mecha should be. It is about a whole new level of human civilization far beyond the humanity as we know. A humanity that have already reached the edge of the galaxy millions of light years away from earth. The civilization of humanity in this anime also follow the scientific law of human civilization. It totally make sense if they have the materials and the technology to make man manned robots with humanoid interface. And they have the real reason for making such dreadful weapon.\\n\r\nThey also have a VERY interesting concept of modern earth and how they will become.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the plot of the story, I find it pretty well done because I've pretty much fall in love to the concept of the anime. Human civilization nearing their final level. They have the society concept of humanity that live in outer space, they have the digital concept of human-like artificial intelligent, they have the technology concept of gravity field generator, the worm hole portal trigger, the energy concept, even the modern earth concept that pretty much cover the whole background of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is what a science pursuer like me have always wanted.\\n\r\nSo, if you are by any chance a scientific person and have a dream that someday there will be an anime who obey the law of human civilization level, you should watch this. I give this anime 10/10 because of that.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as a bonus review after I've watched all of the episodes, I find a huge opportunity this anime have to expand it's story. May it be the story of the earth, the galactic civilization, or the past story of high civilization story of humanity on earth before the froze state.\\n\r\nAnd for the ending, I give a solid 10/10 score for this show. and the best anime of spring 2013 IMO.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 10/10\\n\r\nThis kind of story is not very good, but not bad at all. It has a very interesting basic concept of it and pretty good plots to cover it. But seeing how our culture of anime nowadays went and how otaku nowadays are not really as sensible as the past culture, I think this kind of show won't fit very well with most audience. *taking DAL into consideration.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8/10\\n\r\nI'd give 9.5/10, but... There are some bad animations and defects while the show progresses. But overall, it's still Very Good.\\n\\n\r\nSounds : 7/10\\n\r\nNot very catchy. And the OP/ED is not really makes me want to always listening to is. But It's good anyway.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 9/10\\n\r\nGreat. Just great. I love it when our protagonist is not a stupid weakling that's overly dependent on the others yet trying so hard to save the others (Itsuka F***ing Shidou for example). And the other characters, I also love it when the leaders are responsible and making sense all the time. They are not perfect... but still, Great!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\r\nI f***ing enjoy this show. Why? SENSES!! Something that some of this season's anime doesn't have. It doesn't mean all of the anime have to make sense. But at least when the story needs it, just put some sense into it! Even Hataraku Maou Sama doesn't need any sense in it, but it includes some sense anyway. Just as Keima said, when you like something, you want to finish them at slower rate than the others. Yup. This is the reason why I finish this last. This is so good I enjoy it so much and it takes me more time than the others to re-play each episode before going to the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10/10\\n\r\nA Masterpiece. I am waiting for another season or another concept of story based on this anime's universe.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

            "content": "This anime seemed like it had a pretty good story line to it. Mankind living in a utopia in space was pretty cool enough to me - but finding out that there's another world of humankind that's on Earth? That's something else. I had high hopes for this one, but it wasn't as great as I was expecting.\r\nI wish there were more character developments throughout the anime. It seemed to me that Ledo, an outcast, who was trying to fit in, just kept trying to do that. It wasn't until something really happened that the humans on the earth (or at least Ledo himself) discoveredwhat really happened in the past and revealed why humans lived in two different places. The plot didn't really start moving until towards the last couple of episodes - and everything sort of just happened and came together. There was so much to question that was left unanswered and it frustrated me. \\n\\n\r\nThere was so much that could have happened with how the story was, but it just never progressed. I wasn't really impressed with it.",

            "content": "Gargantia is the Anime I didn't know I wanted to see.  I put it that way in part because, other than that, it's not actually easily to define what it is.  The show starts out with a battle between mecha-driving humans and the damn dirty aliens that have hunted them across the stars.  Sounds familiar, right?  But it takes only a cursory look at the pitch for the series to know that's not the story we're getting.  Ledo, a survivor of the opening space battle is, along with his big robot Chamber, stranded on a distant planet, among a strangepeople, and has to learn to adapt to their ways and lifestyle, which is worlds different (pun intended) from his own.\\n\\n\r\nSo this is a Slice of Life story against a science fiction backdrop, right?  Well, that's not quite correct either.  There's still a main plot to Gargantia, and enough action and mystery throughout it's running time that it can't really be defined as \u201cSlice of Life\u201d.  All the same, its sedate pace and deep consideration of its ideas leave it difficult to call an \u201cadventure\u201d while its overall optimistic bent and high concept science fiction mean that you can't exactly refer to it as a \u201cdrama\u201d without some sort of asterisk either.\\n\\n\r\nIn a lot of ways, Gargantia resembles nothing more than the best of exploratory Speculative Fiction in the western canon, the Scifi/Fantasy tales that are deeply concerned with their world and their characters, and which give you a window onto interesting events taking place in a time or universe deeply removed from our own.  This is the sort of work that's been done in novels like A Fire Upon the Deep (Vernor Vinge) or A Wizard of Earthsea (Ursula K. LeGuin), but attempts to do the same in a visual medium such as television or cinema, where there is a component of time necessitating a particular pace to the story, are quite rare.  Successful attempts are even rarer \u2013 there has yet to be a faithful adaptation of Earthsea, to my knowledge no one has ever attempted to adapt an entry in the Zones of Thought series and, because of the sprawling nature of most of these stories, original versions in visual mediums are harder to find than a habitable planet in the cosmos: while stories like this can be some of my favorites, they don't tend to go over well when you have to have proper beats every however many minutes to keep the work going, their vision of alien settings would make for a prohibitive live-action budget, and it's hard enough to see something original produced in visual media in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nAlong comes Gargantia.\\n\\n\r\nGargantia has the elements of those deep exploration pieces I mentioned earlier.  It has a solid story, but it takes its time with that, so you can really soak in the setting and the ideas.  The show knows better than to rush forward, while still having enough movement to continue to be engaging, rather than turning into a schoolhouse lecture on a fictional universe.  I think a big part of the genius of pulling this off is that it is a fish-out-of-water (no pun intended this time) story, putting a character from one setting alien to the viewers into another setting alien to the viewers, and learning about them both by how the character in question clashes with his new environment, and reacts to the stress of being somewhere he doesn't fit in.\\n\\n\r\nThe ideas in Gargantia are very strong, and would be enough to carry a novel like the ones I listed earlier.  They're also treated with a real maturity that doesn't shy away from the complexities of the issues and how they fit into the universe.  Ledo comes from a heavily militarized, essentially fascist society, and at the start of the story has known no other life than that of a soldier.  As such, he reacts to dangers in a military manner, analyzing foes and determining how to best eliminate threats and complete objectives with full use of force.  This doesn't give with the people he's among down on Gargantia, who are often frightened of or horrified by the massive collateral damage Ledo and Chamber can wreak, both in obvious senses and in less obvious repercussions for using full force.  But where a less intelligent show might just present this issue as Ledo learning a hackneyed \u201cViolence is Bad\u201d message, the presentation in Gargantia is more nuanced.  True, killing every single pirate you come across with the cunning use of well-placed death ray lasers isn't a good solution, but neither is total pacifism expected in the face of armed enemies.  Instead of learning a black and white moral that's easy to spout but hard to apply to realistic situations, Ledo learns more about the value of balance and moderation, weighing the needs of \u201cthe mission\u201d against the needs of a broader perspective on inter-human relations.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, it would have been terribly easy to present Ledo's home culture as simply \u201cbad\u201d, \u201cwrong\u201d, or \u201cevil\u201d... but I think that's territory the show intelligently avoids.  The bitter harshness of Ledo's background came from a situation that necessitated it, and the philosophies and social systems that are applicable where he finds himself would almost assuredly be just as ruinous if forcibly imported to the spacefaring humanity from whence he came just as the social structure and general practices of his home culture wouldn't be appropiate for Gargantia.  Certainly, there's more sympathy for the natives Ledo finds himself among, but at the same time the show doesn't try to force the idea that they'd always be right in every situation.  And, because of that, both cultures feel more realized and possible rather than like straw men for a \u201cgood (or bad) ideology on paper\u201d.  There are deeper examples, but talking about them would start to enter spoiler-land, and will thus be left off.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, there's an interesting narrowness of focus here.  Most of the characters are actually kind of thinly sketched.  We don't need a lot out of characters like Amy, Bellows, or Bevel, and so the show doesn't waste a lot of time making them too much more than what they are: windows onto their world, and into their culture.  Amy does at least get a few good moments, and Pinion actually sustains some good material later in the show, but by in large, this story is all about two characters: Ledo and Chamber.  Ledo, in how he (as a relatively changeable human) reacts to his changed environment, so we can learn more about him as, to an extent, he starts to discover person-hood for himself when divorced from an unyielding need to serve a particular role.  Chamber... Chamber is one of the best Robot or AI characters I've seen. And I don't limit that to \u201cin anime\u201d  Why?  Because he is both a robot and a character.  Chamber absolutely does have a personality, and thoughts of his own.  He can be interacted with basically like a person, and there's a depth and weight to his existence that's something a lot more than a thousands of years removed descendant of Clippy.  All the same, he's also a robot.  Which is to say, he's a non-human intellect predicated on rules of coding, and so he sees the world in a subtly but vastly different way than a human character would, leading him to approach problems or scenarios at angles that make perfect sense when you turn things around and try to think like him, but that don't reflect the same senses and priorities that a human would have.  Credit where it's due, that's pretty amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is also very smart about handling its science fiction, and treats it with more reality than you'd expect out of anything featuring piloted big robots for fighting beings that themselves use biological superstructures.  For instance, in the first episodes there's a language barrier, and it isn't immediately hand-waved away, but is actually used to show the passage of time and the process of Ledo learning more about the people he finds himself among, as he is initially nearly unable to communicate withouth Chamber's help.  Care is taken to make elements that are deep scifi or downright fantastic in their actual nature seem plausible, even natural.  You accept some of the bizarre premises that the show gives you because it takes them entirely seriously.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, importantly for my ability to enjoy the show, it takes its ideas totally seriously without losing a sense of fun.  There's a lot of lighter material in the show, colorful visuals and peaceful or even amusing times that you can just enjoy: the elements that might see Gargantia labeled as at least partially Slice of Life.  It doesn't try to be dark or intense where serious darkness or intensity isn't needed or warranted, allowing you to soak up more of the setting and experience because you want to be engrossed in it, rather than wanting to keep it at arm's reach.  This is supported by the show's overall look.  While it can be visually dark as needed, it's overall very bright and colorful, potentially even oversaturated.  This means, when the scene turns to something gray or eerie, you really feel it, because it's contrasted against the overall visual wonder of the piece.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the only element I don't remember being particularly notable is the sound.  I don't have any problem with it, but I've largely forgotten the OP and ED, and the voice actors are... competent.  They sell their lines well enough, which can't be easy in the scenes depicting the language barrier where they have to say what to the best of my knowledge is untranslated gibberish, but make you understand what they probably mean by their tone and inflection.  This can be helped if they were always given the translations of their lines, but it's still a mark of skill to pull it off.  But at the same time, none of the performances except oddly enough what we hear out of robots is really impressive or memorable in its own right.  Everybody does their job fine, it's just not something that really sticks with you, and I don't know how much of selling Chamber is down to his voice, rather than the writing.\\n\\n\r\nSCORE BREAKDOWN\\n\r\nStory: 10 (Counting World-building here)\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nTotal: 8.8 (9)\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: Gargantia is a real rarity, not just in Anime but in visual media in general.  If you're at all a fan of science fiction, it's worth checking out.  And even if you're not a big sci-fi buff, everything is paced well enough and given sufficient weight that I feel like it would work without a need to appreciate the speculative nature of the fiction \u2013 the fiction is good enough.  Do yourself a favor and give this one a watch.",

You want to watch them achieve, grow, learn, and get along with each other. I personally like that ideological clash between Red (who spent all his life fighting dangerous space squids) and the people on Earth (who spend all their lives at the side of holy squids).

Crap like Infinite Stratos focused too much on being a \"harem animu with a useless self-insert male lead\" and messed up instantly. This show, on the other hand, had some brains behind it and knew what it was doing.\\n\\n\r\nMy hope is that it'll get a proper boat ride towards a US localization; English dubbing and all.

            "content": "Alright let's get to it. Gargantia as I called it, is far from the best series this season or this year and the only real reason anyone says it's such is mainly because of the ending. Give a series a great ending and all of a sudden that makes up for the rest. It's impossible for me to think that way. Gargantia certainly had a great beginning and a great ending but the bridge in between the two cliffs was pretty damn shaky. If anything the series was only good during it's first two episodes and it's last three episodes, everything in between those episodescan be summed up as \"meh.\" The story of a soldier stuck on a foreign planet, attempting to coexist with the natives makes for an interesting premise.\\n\\n\r\nNo doubt, this series had a lot of potential but it went downhill after the beginning but managed to make its way back up near the end. Suisei no Gargantia focuses on two major pieces, Ledo attempting to integrate into Gargantia society and the raging war between the Hideauze and the Galactic Alliance, whose battle originated on Earth. At first one would think we would actually see a lot going on between the Avalon (Galactic Alliance HQ) and the Hideauze but actually, they seem to be nothing more than set up or backdrop in how Ledo was shaped as a character and how he will integrate into the Gargantian lifestyle. So we can say that the Hideauze add to story but are not the most important piece to this series, what's important is how everyone will come together in a hippy-dippy friendship at the end. That's pretty much what this show is all about, getting involved with new people and forming friendships even with your former enemies.\\n\\n\r\nThis show doesn't really deliver on character development and most of them make a lot of stupid decisions that just doesn't make sense and sometimes seem counter productive. Besides the first two episodes and the last three, Gargantia is pretty much filled with half naked, belly dancing girls in which one of them, the female lead Amy is infatuated with the main character Ledo. The series isn't short on fan service but it doesn't really throw it in your face (well except for the belly dancing and beach party episodes). Worst of all, Amy isn't really of much importance despite being the female lead and she could easily be forgotten but every episode, we're given a small reminder that she exist. The characters are incredible hypocrites for no apparent reason what so ever. In the beginning, they're worried about killing other people even if those people were attempting to kill them but in the last episode, the Gargantia is seen killing hundreds of people like it was an extermination. Ledo kills the Hideauze without a second thought but when he learns the truth, he all of sudden is shocked about what he has done but when you think about it, you wonder why does it even matter what the Hideauze truly are? \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this show isn't completely dead, the action is worth watching and Ledo's moments of inner conflict are interesting to see but the overall story seems to have taken an arrow to the knee. I recommend watching it as it seems a lot of people have taken great joy in watching this series but I am left unsatisfied with how things played out. I like the beginning and the ending but not much of what was in between. Most of the time, the shear shock value is what kept me watching which isn't a good thing btw.",

            "content": "Suisei no Gargantia, at first I assumed that this was going to be another common, standard anime that focuses on just nonstop battle of giant robots and snail aliens in space. To my surprise this proved to be the opposite. \r\nStory:6\r\nArt:10\r\nSound:10\r\nCharacter:7\r\nEnjoyment:7\r\nOverall:7\r\nStory: The story of Suisei no Gargantia, even though it wasn't what I initially expected of a space giant robot themed anime, the story was still \"Fair\" at best due to it's lack of originality. The story lacked this because of how easy it was to predict the events that would occur based on the common plot line it follows. The beginning has its ownarc and then the story progresses into a more slice of life, romance, themed anime. With the time spent on the character development of Ledo (the main character), who is forced to adapt to a society that is completely different than the one he grew up in. During this lapse of a main plot goal, the story focuses on Ledo's reintegration into a new society while bringing up the problems Ledo has with his past. When the story begins to move again, as I said before, the outcomes were very predictable, but that doesn't mean the Anime was bad. The way the producers went about bringing the resolution was a little different. The ending wasn't amazing, but it left a somewhat satisfied feeling. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: I've never had to complain about the art and sound of an anime before, and the art in Suisei no Gargantia, being from the year 2013, was very good. The flow of the pictures whether during action or the slice of life moments, was exceptional. That's the main thing I look for in the Art, the quality of the drawings, and the flow the pictures have. The fan service that was included was put in there nicely. It didn't have a major role, but was  like a mint on your pillow. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was beautiful. The OP and ED were very nicely done, and the OST during the anime accompanied the mood of the moment well. To very few anime that I watch can I say, \"I need to download this\" and Suisei no Gargantia has a few tracks that I do want to put into my phone so I can listen later. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The character development was mainly focused on the two dramatic characters of Chamber and Ledo. While Chamber's development surprised me a little bit because not only was Ledo was affected by the kindness and different atmosphere of Gargantia's population, but Chamber, an artificial intelligence, was as well. Ledo's personality change was mainly seen in his goals. As he went through a lack of purpose without the military and the Hideauze to fight, he found another meaning for life, and reasons to protect a society that is different from the one he knew. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this series mainly because of the characters, the plot didn't interest me too much. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like anime such as, Asu no Yoichi, Hataraku Maou-Sama!, Oreigaru, or Princess Lover! they all have that kind of feeling of when the main character is suddenly thrust into a new society that forces them to adapt and change for the better. Although comedy wasn't a main focus in SNG, one can certainly find it through the interactions between the main characters and the society. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading,\\n\r\n-Nebarto\\n\\n",

            "content": "Gargantia is a sort of social sci-fi/ action series focusing on our male lead Ledo trying to integrate himself with the Earth fleet of Gargantia in a post-apocalyptic future after Ledo finds himself isolated from the militaristic space fleet he had been raised with to battle a seemingly alien threat. A good chunk of the series is focused around Ledo slowly mellowing out of the militaristic mentality he had been brought up on with the Galactic Empire as he comes to understand social concepts such as individual worth, understanding of others and moral ramifications in terms of how the instilled mentality he was brought upon would affect others. He does slowly change throughout the course of the series as he understands more of the language on Earth and begins understanding proper social interaction beyond the militarized mentality he had been brought up on, especially as these changes become tested in later episodes when confronted with some shocking realities over the supposed war he was fighting with the aliens.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond Ledo's character development, Gargantia also offers a surprising amount of world building and character exploration for a 13-episode series. The series explores the differing factions and governing structures existing within the world of its series that explore positive and negative social structures that exist among the factions and established governments seen throughout the series. In addition, a number of other side characters have their fleshing out and roles to fulfill as some have their own issues they are trying to overcome or serve to aid Ledo in dealing with integrating with the Gargantia fleet. The OVA bonus episodes released after the TV anime's run add some expansion on aspects to plot and characters within the series such as some back story on Ridget and how Ledo's commanding officer established the cult-like society seen in the second half of Gargantia. The only issues I have with the series as a whole are some subpar attempts at comedy during the anime's first half.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, Gargantia was easily one of 2013's better animated titles with large amounts of visual detail put into the designs of characters, scenery and mecha designs. CG animation is used rather frequently throughout the series in the rendering of mecha, the ships and the endless waters traveled by the crew of the Gargantia. The CG animation used for these is nicely rendered, but does stick out like a sore thumb compared to the regular animation. The series is nicely animated with fluid movement throughout its run with a variety of movement conveyed such as flying via gliders, swimming and aerial fighting as seen during the final battle in the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Gargantia was a solid sci-fi/ action title that delved into Ledo's social integration with the Gargantia fleet and a surprising amount of focus on world building and side characters within its fairly short run time. This is a title definitely worth a look if you are looking for a sci-fi title that is a bit out of the ordinary with what it has to offer up.",

            "content": "Okay, this is my first review so please bear with me...\r\nSo Suisei no Gargantia (SnG) was an interesting find. I found it while randomly surfing google for a mecha anime to watch because I was in the mood for giant robots. I found SnG and decided it might be interesting to watch.\r\nAt 2am I started it, and I was up till 5 watching this show. The beginning of the show hooked me instantly because I have a thing for shows where the main character is thrown into an unfamiliar setting. I will say that the first three to four episodes were good. They showed promisefor a great show, however the thrill of the beginning felt as though it died off as the show progressed. Don't get me wrong I still enjoyed the show as it went along, but the original wow factor it gave me sort of waned off. The ending could have been a little different, but I still enjoyed it regardless. \\n\r\nTechnically wise, things could have been done better.  I felt the art work could have been cleaner. There were times I looked in the background and I was asking myself why that characters had a weird face. Character wise, I felt they were underdeveloped. I mean the OVA and Specials gave a little more depth, but considering it was only a 13 episode show, I guess character depth was not a major concern. Don't get me wrong, I felt Ledo was a decently developed dude, but people like Amy fell flat for me. I thought Pinion had more depth than she did. Sound was decent, I honestly didn't notice an amazing soundtrack or special sounds.\\n\r\nOverall though, I did enjoy the show. I like stories like this where the main character is thrown into unfamiliar territory. My favorite part of the story was the fact they sort of show Ledo's progression into acclimating with society. He starts off knowing none of the language, but as the show progresses he moves onto broken sentences, and then ends on full conversations. All in all, I think it's an enjoyable show that you would probably like.",

            "content": "While the term \"more is better\" is usually true, the statement is subjective at best.  I never like an ending and all too often I want more of something I enjoy and I also want a perfect happy ending.  That being said, I'm also an adult who understands that this does not always equal to good story telling.  \r\nSuisei no Gargantia is a story that tries to juggle many things in a very short episode span.  I find far too often that people judge anime that is shorter than 24 episodes far too harsh.  I would have loved to seethis anime last longer to hash out the characters more and enjoy more time with them, but I accept what I'm given and try my best to judge it accordingly.  All of that being said, on to the review.\\n\\n\r\nGargantia on the Verdurous Planet is like the game series Star Ocean decided to have a baby with the 1995  Kevin Costner film Waterworld and have it babysat by Gurren Lagann.  The main character is from a star faring super advanced society currently in a war against an \"alien\" race.  He finds himself stranded on a post ice-age water covered Earth that has a technology primitive to his own standards.  What follows for the first half of the series is a slice of life tale of learning to adapt to the world he is now apart of.  The second half is a lot more thought provoking and true to form has conflict that spurs a great deal of action and self evaluation.  \\n\\n\r\nMany say that this anime does not identify itself well while others say it tries at too many things.  I beg to differ because, guess what, life is complex.  This story does a wonderful job at hitting on so many points that people need to pay attention to.\\n\\n\r\n- The main character hits home on the struggles of how a soldier tries to adjust to civilian life and how  to overcome what it means to have purpose in a world where their skill set is not needed.\\n\\n\r\n- Bevel's character reminds us that everyone has purpose and value and that their role in society is no less important than anyone else.\\n\\n\r\n-Pinion shows us how futile the need for revenge is.  \\n\\n\r\nAs a total sum of its parts, the main story pushes topics like codependency, prejudice, self-betterment, and overall love for fellow man.  This last topic in particular is mentioned several times over the course of the series and is something we all should strive to achieve.  Our lives are made better by the pursuit of helping our fellow human beings. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, go in with an open mind and you will find yourself wondering why this anime is in the 1k list of anime.  Enjoy!",

            "content": "***This is a somewhat spoiler free review***\r\nSuisei no Gargantia starts out guns blazing with its interesting premise and superb animation but soon falls on its feet before it even gets to third base.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nOut of all the shows this season (maybe aside from Attack on Titan which I dropped in order to follow the manga instead), Suisei no Gargantia had in my honest opinion the best start. The story starts out with Ledo heading into battle against a threat to humanity. In the aftermaths of the battle though, Ledo is transported to a strange world. Little did he know that he is where humanity started;planet Earth.\\n\\n\r\nThe show pulled out ahead compared to the rest with its interesting premise and beautiful animation but when the show hit its midway point, I had started to notice that my anticipation for each new episode was starting to drop. Don\u2019t get me wrong the show overall is pretty enjoyable; it\u2019s just for some reason the studio just decided to turn the \u201cinteresting\u201d factor down for a lengthy couple of episodes. During this boring phase, Ledo was trying to adjust to the life style on the ship compared to what he was used to in the army/whatever. In this time though, we had a bunch of unneeded fanservice flashed into our faces and a bunch of uninteresting squabble between characters that didn\u2019t prove to be worth a damn. The show tries to make the relationship between Amy and Ledo important to the overall flow but what really happens is we learn that Amy (and her friends) are pole dancing mailmen (err women) and that Ledo wants a private showing. The affection Amy had for Ledo just did not translate well for me as I didn\u2019t really care what happened between them even when the show ended.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s worse is when the show finally starts to get back on its feet, it ends. While the final arc\u2019s episodes were extremely interesting to watch due to the nature of the society Ledo finds himself in, the show simply rushes through it. The conflict within the new society sparks way too soon and all the character build up is wasted due to a rush to the final conflict. While the ending is very good, it feels like it could of crescendo even more.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise for the plot was extremely interesting and fresh but fresh can only get you so far if you have a boring second act.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8.2/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty dang good in this 2013 anime. Lighting effects, color selection, and overall animation quality (especially during the fight scenes) was done very well. Character models are another story; in most instances they look great however during some scenes proportions really get out of whack and to be honest the quality just doesn\u2019t seem equal throughout every episode. When watching the show I could very easily point out the certain points in episodes where the quality just seems to drop off randomly.\\n\\n\r\nThere are however without a doubt some really beautiful scenes within this anime. In one of the earlier episodes, there is a moment when the fleet is sailing across the many light bug thingies in the ocean. The lighting effects and overall quality of the animation during this scene completely blew me away. It\u2019s just a shame the quality drops off in later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile the orchestral arrangements are very much welcome in my book, they really did not bring any punch when needed. The score (soundtrack) was very nice but I just found that it did not amplify what was being visually presented. The voice actors did a pretty good job as well but like with the score I just didn\u2019t feel \u201cwowed\u201d by their performance. Not bad but not great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the anime really fell on its face. With such an interesting premise and great sparks of animation, I was so ready to fall in love with the characters and be driven into a great story. This does not happen as each character is as deep as a glass of water. I simply did not care at all for any of the characters in this show because they just did not give me any reason to do so. Both Amy and Bellows come off as lifeless characters that just happen to throw their err features out there whenever needed. The other mailwomen are uninteresting and boring and while Pinion was at first an interesting character, he soon loses any affection after what he does to get the small fleet in danger in the later part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThere just was no reason to like any character in this show. The elder doctor and Amy\u2019s brother were nice additions but their role was so small that they could not possibly add anything to the overall spectrum of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show as a whole barely passes for what I would call an \u201cok\u201d anime. While it had such an amazing introduction and short but satisfying ending, it was completely destroyed by its structural pillars. Characters are the life blood for any show/movie and you cannot expect it to thrive if the viewer doesn\u2019t give a f#$@ about who is on the screen. All I can say is if you end up liking the characters early on then stick with the show. Just understand that while there is a build up to the end, it is short lived. While this is by no means a disappointment on the scale of Sword Art Online, Suisei no Gargantia really let me down.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

            "content": "What is worse, a show that aims high and fail or a show that doesn\u2019t and succeed. Personally, I think the latter is more acceptable. I feel this way since a show doesn\u2019t aim high doesn\u2019t give me false expectations. Shows that do aim high, but fail to deliver just leave me angry and frustrated, such in the case with Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet. \r\nThe first episode set up something that could've been genuinely interesting. It yet another fish of water story, this time it\u2019s in the distant future with a mecha pilot from the Galactic Alliance named Ledo, gets stranded on a floatingboat city called Gargantia ( thus the title name ) on a water covered earth and have to learn to get along with the indigenous population. \\n\\n\r\nWhile this is far from an original idea, it leaves itself open to many different ideas and concepts to explore. But sadly it squandered any potential it had in favor favor of fanservice, filler, shock factor, and deus ex machinas.\\n\\n\r\nThe point where I knew this anime was going suck really hard was when Amy asked Ledo help deal with some pirates to later to condemn him for killing the pirates. Amy is all like \u201c you shouldn\u2019t kill people\u201d for no real reason. First off, it\u2019s Amy\u2019s fault that she never specifies what she wanted Ledo to do. Ledo clearly explained before hand that he is warmonger society and that he was raised specifically for war. What did she expect Ledo to do if she never elaborate on what she want? And this \u201c we value all life \u201c BS is completely contradicted because in the very same episode, the people of Gargantia who were attacked by pirates were using machine guns to kill pirates.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t stop there. In the next episode, the higher ups of Gargantia ask Ledo to help fend off the main pirate fleet, but not to kill any of the pirates. Then the people of Gargantia proceed \u2026\u2026\u2026... to kill the pirates. Seriously, this one of the most backward society ever. Why would they let Ledo pacify the pirates? It\u2019s not like they are holding some moral high ground since they hold no qualms shooting at the pirates. And it would only benefit them if they had Ledo pacify the pirates since his mecha is the strongest thing on the planet. The only reason they do this is just because the plot said so. And if this isn\u2019t a sign of bad writing, I don\u2019t know what is.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the show proceeds to go up it own ass. It really tries to convince its viewers that is moving and emotional, but it just comes off as manipulative and soulless. In the last third, the show does a 180 tonal shift and throws out a bunch of Shyamalan twist just make the viewer go \u201c OMG, I TOTALLY DIDN\u2019T SEE THAT COMING!!\u201d I was burying my face in my hands because I couldn\u2019t give a fuck. The show done nothing to make me care about the characters. And it doesn\u2019t help the fact that the twists are totally clique and can be seen coming from a mile away. Hell, they even use \u201c it was human all along\u201d twist that is used in almost everything. \\n\\n\r\nAnd as if it couldn\u2019t get any worse, the show throws in evil counterparts for the main characters. Now there\u2019s an EVIL Ledo, an EVIL Chamber, and an EVIL Gargantia. Then stuff happens, someone shoots a nuke at the evil Gargantia, Chamber pulls a deux ex machina out of his databanks, and the show just seemingly ends with almost nothing resolved. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I have nothing much to say about them. Other than Ledo, everyone seems to either serve as a plot devices or set pieces. The only other \u201ccharacter\u201d might actually be Ledo\u2019s mech Chamber. Yeah, out of the dozen or so characters, there are only two that might actually be considered \u201ccharacters\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nIf you couldn\u2019t tell before, I don\u2019t recommend this anime. If you want an anime with an interesting world or a soothing atmosphere go watch Haibane Renmei or Shinsekai Yori. If you want a good sci fi story that handles multiple themes go watch Ergo Proxy, Lain, or Zegapain. Seriously, just avoid this show at all costs.",

            "content": "You dont have to worry about if this anime is pretty enough for you.It is.\r\n THE ANIMATION! 4/5\r\n I -am indeed shallow enough that I have a mental prettyness scale and abuse it relentlessly, it's true  there's no denying it - but it would be criminal to ignore the stunning visuals in this show!\r\nThe only part of animation I didn't like was the character design.The features, posture, clothing none of it was likable for me.\r\n The backgrounds were the best part, the water and night scenes were especially nice.I often find it hard to follow an anime when the darkness engulfs everything, Gargantia managesto present the night scenes with noteworthy clarity.\\n\\n\r\nThe movements and visual effects were good , I found Chamber's movements were especially fluid and was a little disappointed that didn't carry on to the rest of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS 2.5/5 \\n\\n\r\n Seeing how even though I enjoyed the show (for the most part) I must admit the characters kind of sucked.  \\n\\n\r\nLedo, our trusty protagonist falls to earth with a very serious, assertive military mind set.He is\\n\r\na particularly gung-ho individual in terms of killing off an entire race of mysterious alien creatures \"Hideauze\", and has very little social skills. However,vigilant he is often distant and odd in the midst of other people.He has trouble communicating with the humans on Gargantia who speak an Earthen language,further alienating him.The residents of Gargantia are a naturally free-spirited and care free bunch,a harsh  contrastto Ledo's serious and relatively strict behavior, he often has trouble understanding their feelings and way of life\\n\r\n.\\n\r\nThroughout the first half he slowly adapts to life on the ship Gargantia. He was for the most part and okay character,but seeing as to how the entire plot revolves around him,he was a little underwhelming and entirely predictable. Also I found him very similar to Eureka  from Eureka 7  .The similarities were hard to look past and I found it hard to think of this as an original story with so many similarities.\\n\\n\r\nChamber,an artificial intelligence created to aid Ledo,was probably my favorite character.\\n\r\nHe was much more productive than his pilot that's for damn sure.\\n\\n\r\nApart from them the rest of the characters fell into a clump of shells.I found nothing original about any of them and none seemed to have any distinctive personality that felt natural consistently.\\n\r\nAmy was perhaps the one exception though she didn't really go past her love fro her brother and bubbly nature.\\n\r\nThere were almost no developments in this matter.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTHE PLOT 3/5\\n\\n\r\nI wonder when they were roughing out the plot for this how they went about it.\\n\r\nI believe it went something like this\\n\r\nPART ONE- Ledo will stop being such a hard-ass and make friends.\\n\r\nPART TWO-Total chaos and  random drama shall take over everything thus completely ruing our eazy-breazy plot thus far.\\n\r\n Like what?\\n\r\n The plot was pulled into two completely different directions and while some may have thought 'oh what a pleasant surprise' others were mostly baffled.\\n\r\nI enjoyed the first have very much.I found it refreshing and even if not flawless  it was enjoyable. PART ONE 4/5\\n\r\nAfter that things got way out of hand and frankly very out of character for everyone. The last half alone was also not 'bad' on its own.If the story had carried out a single theme from beginning till end it would have been great! Where things went wrong was when they couldn't stick with one concept and tried to throw in the second.\\n\r\nPART TWO-2/5\\n\\n\r\nTHE SOUNDTRACK 3/5\\n\r\n- was passable and voice acting was average.The sound effects were actually well timed ,dare I say 'good'. Along with that was some un-noteworthy background music leaving me with a 3/5.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nI did enjoy the first half very much and found it very refreshing.Through  the entirety of the show there is minimal character development and later on it has trouble keeping consistency,both in the plot and character personality.\\n\r\nIf you don't an out of the blue urn-around and don't mind walking into a predictable character then you would enjoy this much more than I did.\\n",

He realizes he\u2019ll have to adapt to his new life on planet Earth doing different kind of jobs to discover one day the origin of the Hidiaazu.\r\nThis anime has an interesting plot to show how much Humanity haschanged into a warrior race, and now this mentality can affect a person in different circumstances, for example, working with not so advanced technology and the way to survive in extremely conditions on a ship. And to discover the existence of friendship something lost in the future of Ledo. Surprisingly is to know the origins of the Hidiaazu, who they really are. \\n\\n\r\nI felt disappointed in the design of the mechas when are used to see some incredible designs in so many animes, however, Chamber is very friendly and always ready to serve Ledo and anyone who needs help. \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime it\u2019s entertaining and original.",

What stands out to me most is that by the end, though there is lots of conflict, I was left feeling like there wasn't really a villain. Which in this case was a good thing, because it meant all the characters and their motives were understandable enough to see why they were fighting and not find their reasoning irrational. \r\nIn fact, there was a lot I liked about this show. I think it handles the whole 'stranger in a strangeland' plot point in one of the best, most realistic ways I've ever seen, even having the voice actors speak gibberish to highlight the language barrier. I liked how much depth they put into exploring this foreign society, how Ledo doesn't understand even their most simple customs and values. \\n\\n\r\nThis show's biggest flaw is simply that it doesn't really stand out much among the masses. There were some moments I really liked but nothing I really loved and got caught up in. And though this is a perfectly likable show that holds up just fine with each rewatching, not having anything to make it really rise above does make the difference.",

            "content": "SUISEI NO GARGANTIA ANIME REVIEW\r\nWarning: Spoiler Alert!\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\r\nPLOT: 10/10\r\nI love the genre of this series. Except that it is a mecha anime, it is also a sci-fi one. An anime that is not only narrating the present situation, however, also is foretelling or showing a possible future state of a human. If it is kinda exaggerated, let us say it shows how human will possibly strive to live in the future.\r\nThis story of this series focuses on a soldier boy which only learned how to fight. Without knowing the really reason for it. It revolves around this guy who make an escape and incidentally foundhimself on earth. Basically, we will found the beginning of the series where Ledo, which is the protagonist, along with Chamber, who is his machine, fight in the outerspace. Upon living on earth, they will learn a lot of things, humanity, caring for one another, how to live whatever the circumstances is, that killing people just because they are weak is not an option. As the story goes, the belief of Ledo will be challenge, a secret will be revealed and the need to choose from what you know is right and what you feel is right will take place. The people around him will strive to live, that are are differeny decision a human can take. Some will not go the way others believed in. That's how life it, literally.\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9/10\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Ledo, is strong. Well, it varies on the one who will watch this anime. It can be that the robot, Chamber, is the one who's strong, physically. However, Ledo is also strong? Independent in a way? And also kinda cute. Yes, he also decides something unappropriate. He also sometimes follow the rage of his heart. But that is what makes him a human. The decision a person makes, even if it contradicts the beliefs all his life, is hard. But he did. He made his mind rational to think correctly on what to do. The robot Chamber is also humane. Though he is a robot, you will never feel like it.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9/10\\n\r\nIt's a great anime. If you're one of those people who also have interest in science or technology or cultural improvement and the like. You might wanna take this one into consideration. This anime has also a piece of comedy. A tragedy, for me. It's mind blowing? If you can appreciate it. You will come to think of \"What if?\" Or \"Is it possible?\" Or \"I wonder\".\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\r\nI don't really have an interest on this part. Yes, I've been listening to opening and ending songs, OST and the like. It's because I love the rhythm. I love the voice. Though the voice actor and actresses, I don't really focuses into. I'm sorry for that. The voices of the character is fine for me. Same with the songs.\\n\r\nENDING: 9/10\\n\r\nTHIS, I HATE! I expected it but I don't want to watch it. I have a feeling that it will be coming, but nooo. I can't accept it. The ending is the best way to end the series, I think? I have no idea if there is a season 2 for this one. But I think, the ending answers all of the loopholes, as well as the scenario suited for the anime. Though, I am still against that one thing. Don't mind my rant. Hahaha.",

            "content": "Very rarely do I give a perfect score to anything but this series most definitely deserves these honors.  It has been a while since I have seen an anime series that was as well done as this one.  I am of course perfectly aware that this series comes from the manga on which it is based, but here I think that they probably did one of the best jobs I've ever seen as far as bringing it to life via animation.\r\nThe story is of course incredible.  While it is short I truly enjoyed ever episode.  It kept me interested and entertainedwhile telling a very compelling story.  The story is of course one where the main character must discover himself and his purpose in a world in which he knows nothing about, but soon finds out more than he ever thought possible.  This is a story of discovery and re-birth for our main character.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is movie quality or better.  Very rarely do you see this quality of animation and art in a TV anime.  I was to say the least drawn in by the quality of the art and the animation.  You can definitely tell that a lot of time and effort was put into bringing this series to life.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is just as good as the animation.  Movie quality or better.\\n\\n\r\nOur main character Ledo has a lot of growing to do over 13 episodes and the story comes around that growth quite well.  Ledo is thrust into a world that he can not understand let alone comprehend.  Ledo is a soldier and always has been.  So when he finds himself in a strange world where those qualities aren't necessarily needed and are most times frowned upon he has to grow beyond his \"purpose\" and find a his place in his new home.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed this anime.  I really wish there was more to the story as I really fell in love with this story and it's characters.  But with that aside I don't feel let down by the way it ended.  It was a good ending and an appropriate one for the story.  I am currently re-watching the series.",

It did start out well, but then it started to become too volatile and flexible and therefore, it also leaned closer to the boring side. One of the best aspects of this anime was the plot twist at the end which changed my views of the entire anime, but sadly this anime lacked consistency and failed at keeping the viewers on the brink of enjoyment. Boring it can be at times, this show does do some things well and some rather not.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10: Story: The story of Suisei no Gargantia, is of a space giant robot themed anime, it begins in the distant future in the far reaches of the galaxy. The Human Galactic Alliance has been constantly fighting for its survival against a grotesque race of beings known as the \"Hidiaazu.\" In an intense battle, the young lieutenant Ledo and his humanoid mobile weapon Chamber are swallowed up into a distortion of time and space. Ledo realizes after a certain period of hibernation that he has arrived on Earth, the planet on the lost frontier. On this planet that was completely flooded by the seas, people live in fleets of giant ships, salvaging relics from the seas' depths in order to survive. Ledo arrives on the fleet 'Gargantia'. With no knowledge of the planet's history or culture, he is forced to live alongside Amy, a 15-year-old girl who serves as a messenger. To Ledo, surviving, adapting and coping with the Japanese language and in Gargantia will be a struggle, until things get bad.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8: Nice art in battle scenes, but ok.\\n\r\nSound 7: None of the sound tracks were really memorable, the opening was good tho!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7: Has some.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7: Like i said 10 times before, its good at the start then falls off, but catches a bit back with its plot twist.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8: PLOT TWIST, i lied, this isnt the best anime of 2013. \\n\\n\\n",

The tear-jerking moments, the action and the comedy had all came together to create a beautiful piece of art.\r\nArt 8/10: TO BE PRECISE, the first episode's art was way off the charts and was quite possibly 10/10. However since the landing on Earth, the art slowly started to become more generic and casual, which i would give 7/10 at themost.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: The music, although complimented the scenes and moments very well, wasn't enough to be anything above and beyond on its own, which is the reason why i'm awarding it with a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: There were many developed characters and all of their roles were important in order to progress the story, you don't see that in many anime these days, as many of them literally have two main characters with the rest being expendable/uninteresting/boring. The way Chamber's \"artificial intelligence\" was slowly turning into humane emotions and empathy as the show progressed really made me doubt if he was really an AI when he made so many actions that contradicts his very system as a \"Pilot Support Enlightenment Interface System\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: Although the story was amazing and the other aspects were at the very least decent if not very good, the pace of the anime sometimes felt inconsistent, either rushed or went a little too slowly. (only reason its not 10/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: Definitely worth a watch, its one of my favorite animes and i feel like it should deserves more attention than it gets.\\n",

            "content": "Suisei no Gargantia by Gen Urobuchi, as a fan of Gen Urobuchi's anime series such as Fate/Zero and Madoka, this review is really hard for me to write without a strong bias towards it. \r\nThis is a anime released in 2013 that have a strong and innovative storyline, beautiful artwork and soundtrack and well-developed character design all together (basically an awesome anime). And with one of my favourite anime studio, Production I.G. behind the reins, this anime nailed itself in the top of my list of highly anticipated anime in 2013.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nAfter watching the series, I can't help but to compare the script with otherGen Urobuchi's series such as F/Z, and I was slightly disappointed (may be 0.5%) of the scriptwriting. It is overall a very well written script, with great insight into Gargantia, the flotilla state sailing on a planet with ocean only! But it lacks a small drop of Urobuchi's cinematic and serious moments in his script, such as the ending of F/Z that depicts of the devastation of various characters, and SoG lacks some of it (but I still enjoyed it immensely). The story is mainly describing the daily lives with life-changing events that I would not spoil, but it also details the two very different lives of Gargantia and Galaxy Alliance (I made that up as I watched it in Japanese), and the representation of the two are projected in the two main characters, Amy and Redo. The story sparks when the two radically different ideals clashed together; they had heated arguments in trying to convince each other, but they also tried to understand and accept them. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough people might think the story is quite dull in the first few episodes, but the team constantly brings new surprising elements into the world, energizing the atmosphere with a breath of fresh air, and to keep us entertained throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\\n\r\nRating for artworks in anime differs between every audience of the series; some people love it, some people won't enjoy the style of the artwork. In my opinion, I absolutely enjoy the artwork of SoG. The beautiful variation of bright colours of the giant flotilla is just pure amazing, and placed on the beautiful background of the blue ocean displays the ships in a lively and exciting way. \\n\\n\r\nThe design team definitely caught the idea of \"Exciting yet peaceful lifestyle\" perfectly in the series, detailing every moment of Gargantia's residents lifestyle with near-photograph quality, and innovative machineries reminding us that they are on a tight-decked ship. The contrast of various districts in the cabins also creates a more interesting environment, and to describe the story of the characters in a refined method.\\n\\n\r\nThe underwater artwork are also done in a realistic view, detailing underwater ruins describing of another civilisation (SPOILERS), and even though there aren't as many colours as the flotillas, but the ever-changing environment drew so much of my attention, admiring the beautiful micro-orgasms floating in the ocean sparkling in its unique way. And with deep sea salvaging as the prominent occupation of Gargantia, there are good amount of scenes underwater that would satisfy all of us.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also some elements of combat, and although they are all well-developed gundam style combat scenes, but there is only one thing that I would complain. THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH! :D there should be a couple more scenes detailing on how awesome Chamber fires its megapower awesomeness at the enemies, frightening the souls out of them (quite literally)!\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks are done very nicely to dress the anime, suitable yet not dominating over the other elements. The calm soundtrack detailing the ocean waves and cries from the seagulls, to the intense and rough soundtrack in combat scenes that would make your blood rush in excitement. I only gave it an 8 because I compared it to other anime series with even better soundtracks (Angels Beat, F/Z. This is my preference, don't rage on me :D)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\\n\r\nVery good development of the characters, with detailed back story for most of the characters, and it helps understand the personality and found out the reason behind their actions. The anime design team certainly made a strong effort in creating the characters suitable in the world with lots of ships and water. \\n\\n\r\nRedo and Amy, the two major characters in the series, are very well described as the two radical ends of the horizon, with Redo as a soldier and Amy as a postwoman for Gargantia. The two of them had radically different ways of living; Redo lives as a loyal soldier, with orders being the creed that determines all his actions, while Amy values living in its best. In time Redo was influenced by Gargantia and eventually started to understand life, and the process is never dull to watch. Amy served as the saving rope for Redo in the series, reaching out for him when he is alone in the planet without his comrades (except the robot), and supporting him during his weakest moments. The classic 'boy meets girl' moment is displayed and it doesn't bore us at all.\\n\\n\r\nAnother major character of this anime that I should definitely mention is the 'Machine Caliber' robot that crashed into the planet along with the pilot Redo, Chamber. He is one of the prominent characters that lightens the mood of the series while instilling serious ideals, a feature in many of Urobuchi's scripts. Chamber serves as companion, friend, teacher, comrade and moderator of Redo, teaching him of many things Redo never learnt, with the classic mechanical tone of an A.I., it also surprised many of the residents in Gargantia because of its advanced technology in destruction, but also in creation and harmony, creating the image of an \"Angel\" in the hearts of the primitive citizens (in space-faring civilization's view). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSuisei no Gargantia is a very enjoyable anime in 2013, the well-written storyline matched with art and sound kept us entertained, and the intense moments took us in and we could feel it as if we are in the anime itself. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I absolutely enjoyed Suisei no Gargantia and definitely would call it as one of the best in the 2010s series. I would recommend it greatly to any Gen Urobuchi's fan, and also any newcomers to the series. The exciting adventure of Redo and Chamber along with the peaceful and symbolic Gargantia would definitely make many people watch this over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nVery looking forward to any future projects of SoG\\n\\n\r\n:D",

            "content": "Gargantia On The Verdurous Planet is an unforgettable anime series that provided for me a very bittersweet viewing experience. Sweet because I thoroughly enjoyed every last bit of it, bitter because there wasn't more to it than 1 season. Gargantia is essentially all of my favorite anime concepts rolled into one. Giant robots, vivid worlds, outer space, artificial intelligence, age-old wars, alternative species and a somewhat realistic fantasy view at the future. The main character Ledo is used to convey the always relevant story of a soldier who finally stops to question the very reason that he is fighting. He is a surprisingly complex characterthat undergoes a very beautiful progression throughout the story that is sure to awaken a strong sense of humanitarianism in all those who watch (or at least it did for me). The natives of Gargantia and the way that their everyday lives were put together is one of the most accurate and fluid interpretations of a post-futuristic world that I have seen in a film or television series thus far. This wouldn't be an accurate review if I didn't address the bad in this series, but I would be a liar if I said that I was at odds with anything except the length of this series. However, even the short-lived length of the series does provide a positive, as it doesn't  allow for any room to ruin a near-perfectly told and crafted story and makes the series very accessible without having to sit through hours of episodes in order to play catch-up. Gargantia is one of my favorite short series of all-time, and I would recommend it to any anime fan eager to explore a vast world with an impressive blend of fantasy and realism.",

            "content": "I unintentionally marathoned this anime in a day. \r\nStory: It's true there are some plot points that could have used more fleshing out. The anime is 13 episodes long and could have benefited from a few more episodes in order to build out the world in less of a rush. However, the whole thing is very solid and deeply interesting. I didn't even realize I'd managed to watch the whole thing in the day, because it was the anime equivalent to reading a page turning book. It's well paced, with characters you care about and want to see succeed and a bit of a twistthat even if you see coming will still prove interesting. The story also does an excellent job of raising moral questions and concepts without necessarily forcing their final answer down your throat.\\n\\n\r\nArt: This anime is just really pretty to look at. I became interested in it after seeing it in an amv, because the style really intrigued me. For me the art style is everything since anime is a visual medium and this one just really is pretty.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I tend to only notice sound if it's bad, so the fact that I didn't notice is a very good sign. Also I really enjoyed both the opening and closing themes, which for most series I tend to skip one of the other. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The protagonist, Ledo, is among my favorite characters currently. You learn a lot about the world he comes from by the way he acts allowing for an impressive level of world building when we spend 12 of the 13 episodes on Earth and not where he came from. The character on Earth are all interesting, with clear motivation. I think a few of them could have been more fully fleshed out, but those who are in the foreground dealing with Ledo are all very interesting and are more than enough for the story the creator's set out to tell. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really loved this series. I'm pretty sure I'm going to end up watching it again at some point as it was very well done and there's some things I think will become more clear with a second viewing (which is a very good thing in my book).\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would very highly recommend this anime.",

The story is very unique: ad-mist an interstellar battle a young human soldier in a mecha suit is accidentally transported while retreating from battle to what was thought to be the lost civilization of Earth.  The plot follows the boy as he tries to cope with the more carefree lifestyle of the ship-city Gargantia.  Most of the conflict from this show derives from cultural misunderstandings, which is interesting to watch and unfold.  The information and the mystery unfold in a very paced way.  The viewer isn't constantly thrown so much information.Gargantia is able to calmly reveal aspects of the story in bits and pieces.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said nothing really pops from this show.  The action is there, light humor is there, the characters are there, but they don't necessarily bring that \"wow\" factor.  These weren't bad, but they weren't great just right smack down the middle.  If you're looking for the \"WOW\" anime of the season personally I don't think it's this one, but I would definitely recommend it.",

In this case I grade it very mediocre. \r\nCharacter - I liked the main characters Ledo andAmy, I thought they were very good and believable although the character deelopment between Ledo and Amy felt a bit rushed. My faviourite character has to be Chamber, the name of the AI within Ledo's mecha, Chamber had a good amount of character development and even makes a tear-jerker decision at the end which I felt was a perfect way to show off his character development. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Is a pretty enjoyable watch and the first couple of episodes do a good job of making you want to watch more. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - A good anime, as previously mentioned OP and insert music is not really memorable. Some might not be too keen on character designs but I hope they stick with it because a good watch.",

The initial battle scene drew me in, there was so much detail and it was clear who the enemies were. You sided with the protagonist(Ledo, 16, male) automatically given that the hideauze were so nasty looking. \r\nNext, he lands on earth, whoa, big surprise there. He ends up making a few mistakes, but they are forgivable since hes got this bad ass machine that can make up forhis wrong doings.\\n\r\nAlthough this anime doesn't go in depth into Ledo's (main protagonist) adaption to earth (psychologically) it still shows us as viewers, that there are still human emotions like greed, happiness, violence. Humans are still at each others throats and also work together after the earth turns to sea. There is still humanity around the world, and different opinions bring forth different actions. (i.e episode 13)\\n\r\nArt (10):\\n\r\nThe eyes....\\n\r\nThe eyes drew me in, the detail was spectacular, but if you think the eyes were amazing, look at the background. The rust, the skies, the ocean were very detailed and i've only seen a few animes with such detail.\\n\r\nSound (8):\\n\r\nGreat sound, like many other animes.\\n\r\nCharacter (7):\\n\r\nLedo was a great character, exactly expected of the lead male protagonist.\\n\r\nChamber had such a deep and logical understanding of humans. Whilst watching the anime, I thought that Chamber could \"persuade\" Ledo to destroy the humans, but nope that doesn't happen. \\n\r\nAmy was pretty simple, shes got some nice assets, I would consider her more of a side character since all she does is send mail and hope that Ledo doesn't die? Shes not very useful. I guess she helps Ledo become more human?  \\n\r\nOverall (8):\\n\r\nArt was beautiful thats always a plus in any anime. Story had the potential to turn around, but it didn't. Definitely didn't take a really bad turn though. Could have been longer, more detail would have been better. I wouldn't rewatch this, but I am glad I did watch this. \\n\\n\\n",

My roommate and I re-arranged our set up so we could watch tv in bed, enabling us to start watching anime together (As I was a newbie and he was introducing me to some of the greats) We went through a good few anime, and then one day this thing popped up on the recommended shows in my Netflix queue. Looked new enough, so we figured, \"eh, why not?\" And that's how I came to see Gargantiaas a hidden gem anime, one we just happened to stumble upon.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThe premise starts off interesting enough, with the concept of people interacting from different cultures takes a few interesting turns. What truly makes the story is the end though, and the revelations that come with it. Truly the best part of this anime is it's resolution.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe art is indicative of what I like to call the \"modern\" anime style, which is pretty, flashy, and atmospheric when it needs to be. (Which I'm personally fine with, I find the progression of the art of anime has continually gotten more aesthetically pleasing)\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe general audio quality is acceptable, but in terms of voice acting, I felt every character spoke with the adequate amount of emotion for the situation. (I found Chamber sound felt very right, which can be a hit or a miss with AI voices)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nLedo and Chamber make this show hands down. Their interactions with each other and the other members of the cast are so interesting and thought provoking. Guilt, duty, contemplation, and worry all have their place in the main character's development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nIt was very enjoyable to watch, making me happy, sad, and scared throughout, not to mention emotional at the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nThis was a very pleasurable anime, I am truly glad I found this anime, and feel it is underrated in the community. If your still reading this, then please, try it out! You won't be disappointed.",

            "content": "This is my first review, but I do not intend to fluff this up at all. This series is flat up entertaining. It is not your typical mecha/teen anime. The writer involved in  Psycho Pass, Fate/Zero, and Phantom - Requiem for a Phantom wrote this in collaboration with the writer from Code Geass. The animation is fairly high budget and looks great. There is very little fan service and that is a plus for me. Is it the greatest story ever told? No, but its pretty dang good. Is it the best characters orart ever? No, but its pretty dang good. That's probably the best way I can describe this anime, pretty dang good.\\n\\n\r\n           In my humble opinion, it should be ranked an 8 on MyAnimeList, however, we had a lot of great competing anime in 2014 and this title is not extremely well known - yet. This is the underdog anime of 2014. If you watch all 12 episodes of this anime including the ending OVA and you \"don't like it\", I don't think I will have much faith in humanity anymore. This series has something for everyone. In short, I am happy I found this one and liked it enough to purchase the blu ray.",

            "content": "Forewarning. This review is quite freeflowing. I do try to cover generic topics such as story, characters, visuals, audio and so on, but these will not be very structured. Gotta leave some work for the readers as well, eh ;). Oh and it does contain some mild spoilers. You have been warned.\r\nLet me start by saying - Suisei no Gargantia or Gargantia of the Verdurous Planet is a good show. It's a solid, 13-episode rollercoaster of action, suspense, comedy and emotions. It has a good start, a satisfying (albeit anticlimactic) ending and an entertaining middle bit to boot.\r\nThe story follows a young officer caught inthe middle of a seemingly never-ending war between the Galactic Alliance of Humanity and the Hideauze (hideously original naming, I know). Our hero, Ledo, serves in the Galactic Alliance, fighting on the frontlines in an operation that is humanity\u2019s biggest and probably last effort to end the war once and for all. Unfortunately the attack fails; the Alliance tries to retreat and in all the hassle Ledo gets left behind. He ends up stranded on a primitive planet covered by oceans. He\u2019s found by some divers from a massive floating fleet (more like a city) of Gargantia, and he soon discovers that the planet he\u2019s stranded on is actually the original birthplace of humanity, the Earth, thought to be inhabitable.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was interesting. A bit predictable at times, but still enjoyable. Some others would argue that the middle drags for too long; looking at other reviewers, that seems to be one of the most common criticisms offered. But I don\u2019t really think so. I do agree that at times the show was a tad slow and too slice-of-lifey (e.g. the bit where they \u201ccelebrated\u201d the calm), but I would argue that even these bits were fundamentally important not only for character development but for world-building as well. For character development to be believable, the audience as well as the actual characters arguably need a slower paced moment like that to process their thoughts, emotions, relationships \u2013 and then develop based on these (inner) conversations.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, I found them to be pretty okay overall. The main character Ledo starts off very one-dimensional but luckily he's the one who develops the most during the course of the series. At first he's this ruthless killing machine, who just mindlessly follows orders and is even eager to sacrifice himself for his cause. Gradually, upon spending time stranded on Earth and learning the ways of this new world unspoilt by war he starts to change. The development is predictable but it's still well fleshed-out. \\n\\n\r\nChamber, or the Artificial Pilot Guidance System, is the story's main companion character. His logical analyses help Ledo a great deal, and their relationship is fun to follow. By the end of the show Chamber even develops a human-like side to himself! Voiced by the wonderfully talented Tomokazu Sugita, Chamber was for me personally the best bit of the series. \\n\\n\r\nAlongside the two main characters we had a mixed cast of others as well. There\u2019s the female lead, Amy; her bed-ridden little brother, Bevel; the goofy mechanic, Pinion; the treasure hunter Bellows; the fleet officer Ridget amongst others. To me, all of them were relatively likable, even though they didn\u2019t get too much development. Their interaction was fun to follow, and you really got this family-like feel of belonging and acceptance from all of the crew on Gargantia; it was nice. Even the minor (filler) characters weren\u2019t annoying. That's rare! Like for example Amy's friends, the other two kitegirls. They were surprisingly alright.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion the only character that\u2019s not so well delivered is the show\u2019s main antagonist, colonel slash emissary of God, Kugel. He feels very superficial (and fair enough, there is a reason for this, but I won\u2019t spoil that) and right-out flat as a villain, probably because he was abruptly introduced so late in the anime. It\u2019s a shame, since I think his character has a lot of promise. I hope they would have fleshed him out more, but oh well. He does his job as being the bad guy, and the audience gets a nice, although anticlimactic good vs. evil face-off.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that annoyed me was the language. How on earth (pardon the pun) was Ledo able to became fluent in Japanese so quickly? Same thing could be asked about the bad army guy as well. Pretty unrealistic for people with no need or prior knowledge of learning a language to adapt to it so quickly. I would have been delighted if instead of the calm bit, they would have held Japanese lessons for Ledo and Chamber or something. :D I think that filler moments in shows like these have so much potential, because the setting and the world seem so rich, so why the fuck not draw upon them a bit and be creative? We don\u2019t need a beach episode in every single anime there is. Jesus.\\n\\n\r\nTL:DR. An enjoyable sci-fi anime with a coherent story, pretty likable cast of characters and an interesting setting. One of the better \u201cshinsekai\u201d anime I\u2019ve seen. Would recommend. 8/10.\\n",

I liked how the explained why his super robot was far superior to the local mecha. Plenty of cute girls, a slice of life story involving mecha. Then comes the second half of this series and it couldn't be any more predictable. The second Ledo pulls a gun on a steamed squid, you know the whale squid are Hedeauce. The second the offer to leave Gargantia you know Ledo is going to leave too. The second his commander shows up you know he's evil anda duel must ensue. These are not spoilers these are easily predictable facts. The show inevitably goes in these directions. BUT it's beautifully done, and seven episodes of different with very likable characters, even Chamber is likable. But the second half is stretches a very predictable story. Bonus points for not having to invent a reason for the swimsuit episode.\\n",

            "content": "There's great things that keep the series afloat where otherwise, in my opinion it should've sank.\r\nForemost, the characters lack depth and originality becoming borderline cliche- ranking as side-girlfriend, the soldier boy, the pirate queen, and so on. They live in their archetypes and it consequently makes none of them memorable. I see it also as a consequence for including too many characters, and instead of making greater central characters and good supporting characters, all characters instead suffer for lacking depth. Lastly in terms of plot, this comes across as a little version of Macross; packing mechs, man vs. alien-bugs, and  deep space/tech concepts. \r\nConverseto the points above, the beautiful character design and world makes for great eye candy. Most obvious is the colorful tropic fashion that is reminiscent of Gypsy designs mixed with tribal accents. It makes for excellent character individuality and in a more conceptual theme -  a contrast against the dark synthetic uniform design of the main character. The ships and cultural attention granted to the sea makes for a fantastic world to place the characters within. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a fun watch, but it isn't a masterpiece. If the character and plot issue was addressed to be a bit less... flimsy - i would love to see another season that would explore this world.",

Since I am a person who enjoys not looking at synopsi when watching a show, I decided to give the show an episode or two. \r\nWhen I began watching the show, I was HOOKED. Amazing plot line, interesting conflict, and the main character had very interesting characterization. However, with watching episode 5, I was disgusted, and remained so until roughly episodes 7/8.\r\nSee, the thing that got me hooked was the maincharacter's alienation from the humans that surround him. Though with episodes 5-8, the main character experiences \"what it is truly like to be human\", which the anime displays as being a glutton at a festival and watching belly dancers at a bar. It was sickening to watch these already sexualized female character become tools to the plot line. To make it worse, the main character is forced into a romantic relationship with the lead female, resulting in a half-assed subplot that allows for \"motivation\" for the lead during the final episode. \\n\\n\r\nBut the ending of the show deals with some existential questioning of what is means to be human, which salvages the show from the grinder is was put in mid-season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is alright. The only good character in the show is the main character, and the females are all a joke, but the plot was intriguing enough to keep me from trashing the show after the fifth episode.",

            "content": "Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet is an interesting anime. I don't always like mecha anime, but Gargantia is a little bit different. \r\nstory: though the story was a little predictable, the overall story arc was well thought out. I'm sure many will disagree with this assessment, so let me explain. At first glance, it might seem like there is a huge mood whiplash between the first and second halves of the story. Certainly, the mood of the first half is much more lighthearted. But if you look at it thematically, the first half of the story is a mirror to the second half; it foreshadowswhat is to come. The first half serves to educate Ledo and Chambers, demonstrating that a) their notions about the purpose of existing might be incorrect and b) educating them on how to live in a new environment. The first half creates an emotional bond between Ledo and the people of Gargantia. Without that bond, what happens in the second half wouldn't have had as much meaning. I won't write any spoilers, but essentially the first half is essential for informing the decisions made in the second half.  Other than the actual plot, I think this show does an excellent job creating an interesting, unique futuristic society on Gargantia. There isn't a lot of drawn-out exposition; it's explained subtly through character interactions and the environment.\\n\\n\r\ncharacters: it is easy to think that the only characters with any real depth in this anime are Ledo and Chambers, but it is also a misguided notion. Without a doubt, the \"alien\" and his robot do undergo the most growth and development in this story, but that is to be expected; this is THEIR story, after all. It's ABOUT them coming to a new planet and having all their notions about duty, humanity, and life challenged. Moreover, there are only 13 episodes, so there really isn't time for every single character to go through a full character arc. Think about it this way: characters exposed to the biggest challenges are the ones that will change the most. Life doesn't change that much for anyone except for Ledo and Chambers, so it makes sense that those two have the most development. Furthermore, Amy as a female lead is representative of the ideals and mindset of the people of Gargantia. She is symbolic of the society she was raised in. Amy is carefree, helpful, and accepting. She might not stand out as a particularly unique character, but that doesn't mean she's just another two-dimensional character. She has a strong will and desire to help all her friends, including Ledo. She tries the hardest to understand him and in turn help *him* understand her world. Her character has a subtle strength rarely seen in media.  As for some of the other minor characters, we don't get much of a backstory for them, but it's not really needed. This isn't one of those \"everyone gather around the hero\" stories; each character has their own life and goals the dictate how they interact with the main characters. Pinion isn't  really bad or good. He's motivated by his own interests. We learn enough about him to understand why he's willing to risk so much to go to the whalesquid nest, especially because it seems to contradict what most people in his society believe about the whalesquid. While initially distrustful of Ledo, Pinion comes to see that Ledo can help accomplish what was once only a dream. His behavior towards Ledo changes once he realizes this. \\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts: Apparently, Suisei no Gargantia is not a show that suits everyone's tastes. If you're willing to reflect on it a bit, it certainly does have a deeper message about coexistence, humanity, and the meaningless follies of war. It probably won't change your life or tell you anything you haven't heard before. What it does do is provide a lens to view our own society by making the familiar strange and the strange familiar. It's an interesting series and short enough that you won't feel you've wasted your time.",

This is a great mecha show with a very human touch to it.\r\nI really enjoyed the positive messages in this show, which really boils down to independence and enjoying life. Sure, these messages can be cliched, but I think cliches exist for a reason. The way these messages are presented (especially in the first half of the series) is very well-done, and I couldn't help but find this show to be quite touching. The later part of the series also gets really intense, and by the last episode I found myself so embroiled inthe story that I was shouting at my TV set! The one complaint I have about the series is that the ending did seem a bit rushed, but I think that is just the nature of a 13-episode series. Overall, the show was just a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the animation is freakin' gorgeous! I watched this streaming through Crunchyroll on my xbox, and the art looked so sharp, crisp, and vibrant. I love the use of the bright colors. Oh, and I found the ending theme to be particularly catchy too.\\n\\n\r\nI'd like to note that the first half of the first episode presents itself as some pretty ordinary mecha. I urge you to complete the first episode before deciding to drop this series. This portion of the episode used a lot of nonsensical sci-fi jargon, and was pretty much just fancy explosions and mecha fighting. There is a purpose to why the series starts off this way, and it is to establish where our protagonist is coming from. Again, I strongly advise anyone giving this show a try to complete the first episode, and then decide whether or not to keep watching from there.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has become one of my favorites. Highly recommended!",

If you're looking to reflect it may be an anime for you. If you like Eva I would recommend watching this.\r\nWhat I liked: Art style was superb. Rich colors and character design brought this world to life. Good story setting and decent progression. Characters develop and have life and emotion in their animation and voice. Voice actors are top notch in the original. OST is bright during downtime and suspenseful during action shots.\r\nWhat I didn't like: CGI models being used.It really took me out of the anime when a shot was pure CGI. It's a small complaint and honestly the only fault visually.\\n\\n\r\nIt's unfortunate that it wasn't picked up for another season.\\n\\n\r\nI give this an 8.5 out of 10.",

            "content": "Out of the anime this season I found this anime to be one of the best that kept my interest and kept me coming back.  \r\nThis is a story built upon a young man who is strict in his morals and code of ethics.  He happens to land on a planet that's made of water where there are connected boats and people working together for a common goal.  He doesn't understand the world at all, but slowly starts to gain connections.  This is an anime that shows a character finding where he belongs, and what he truly believes in and Ifeel that's what makes this story so powerful.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the animation is fantastic.  The way they created the art was like you were living in a fantasy that had come to life.  Beautifully done, with nice colors.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime each played some role.  I enjoy anime that actually have characters that play a role and maintain that role through out the anime.  This anime had memorable characters that took the show to the next level.  Each shared some level of their existence offering the viewers a glimpse of what connected them to the story and what pulled the story together.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this anime didn't waver through one episode.  I stayed interested through out the entirety of the anime, which may not seem like very long due to the length of the anime, but sometimes when you see so much things seem mundane and similar.  I cheered for relationships to form, and mysteries to be solved, all while hoping for a spectacular ending.  I will say that I really did like this anime and my enjoyment level remained even after the anime had finished.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime for me was aesthetically appealing.  It was not only beautifully done, it was something I looked forward to every week.",

            "content": "You looking for a legit mecha anime? Wrong place to be then.\r\nJust kidding, Suisei no Gargantia is an anime not only mecha, but love and comedy and a the funky stuffs. NO\r\nSuisei no Gargantia is where...well synopsis explains it well enough for new comers so let get into review. This anime requires somewhat a understanding; I'm not saying it's hard to understand like as if the time line is jumping from 1970s to 1700s, then to 1800s and back to 1900s like Bac**no!! The character set up is quite something so lets jump right into it\r\nCharacter explanation\r\nLedo: Main character of the story. While returning tothe ship after \"the mission\" fails, Ledo was thrown into other space (or possible galaxy), and shipwrecks into Gargantia, Earth. Ledo, not being able to communicate (different language) with the people Gargantia, abducts Amy and runs, buying time for his machine caliber, Chamber, to analyze where this place is and the language these people were speaking. He finds out that this place is Earth, and with the current situation (abduction and weapon possession), Ledo is held captive by the Gargantia. Later when the \"Pirates\" attacked the crew of Gargantia, Ledo and Chamber exterminated the pirates, and then protected Gargantia from the future revenge attack by the Pirates, which ultimately made him gain trust to the people of Gargantia. Even while Ledo is living Gargantia, he only thinks about returning to Galactic Alliance and exterminate Hideauze. Ledo is just a pure solider like; he talks like a solider, doesn't know anything about living in leisure or relaxing. He is very stubborn and fixated when it comes to enemy (pirates, Hideauze, etc.). Ledo can't think gray; he only answers in black or white.\\n\\n\r\nAmy: Main heroine of the story. She works as a postal deliverer in Gargantia. She is the first person that has come in contact with Ledo(during the abduction). She is not hostile but rather amicable towards Ledo, even though she was abducted and pointed gun by him. Amy tries her best to change Ledo's thought that there can't be coexistence between Humanity and Hideauze. Amy's personality is very cheerful, friendly, and warm hearted, but also emotional (not in a hysteric way).\\n\\n\r\nChamber: Machine Caliber of Ledo. the Robot that you have been waiting for. Chamber becomes quite useful; until Ledo was capable of speaking Gargantian Language, Chamber acted as the translator for Ledo and Gargantia. With its overwhelming over-technology it possesses, Chamber helps Gargantia by moving supply cargos, catching massive amount of fish at once, and most importantly, the protection of people of Gargantia. Chamber is an AI (Automative Intelligence), so it can act by itself however with the permission of Ledo.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many other supporting characters in this anime, which I can't possibly say every single one of them since it will the a complete spoiler from then. For this anime, however, understanding of not only the main characters, but the supporting characters is needed to enjoy this anime to it's full potential. Gargantia itself features quite a colorful, vivid background and absolutely fantastic drawings for starry skies. For opening theme, Chihara Minori(sama) sung \"Kono Sekai wa Bokura o Matte Itta\", which is just...great.\\n\\n\r\nWhoever watching or planning to watch Suisei no Gargantia must know one thing: Robot related anime can be this peaceful and soothing to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSo If you are looking for something with a new taste, Suisei no Gargantia should be listed as one of your choices.\\n",

            "content": "I've never been into mecha and stuff alike, When I was a kid I was always afraid of metalheads talking like human, I don't know why. Maybe its because when I was a kid I was a lot feminine than most of the guys? Oh. Don't get me wrong, I don't swing that way(if you know what I mean). So I decided to give Suisei No Gargantia a try, and it didn't disappoint me. Here's why.\r\nStory : 9\r\nEarth is suffering from a new ice age, making it inhabitable for humans. So humans were forced to find another planet. And Galactic Alliance was formed to findsuitable planets for human to live in. Basically the show is about the Galactic Alliance trying to defeat Hideauze, alien life forms that threatens humankind. And that's where our main guy comes. Leto, a second lieutenant at Galactic Alliance fought against the Hideauze. They're mission was to annihilate Hideauze's lair. But they failed, and were forced to retreat. Leto and his Machine Caliber(Gundam-like robot)  Chamber were attacked and was forced to crash on an uknown planet. The uknown planet turns out to be Earth. And he crashed on Gargantia. Gargantia a big ship on earth consisting of many ships that are linked to together. Basically its a big fleet. Its an alliance of humans on earth against pirates. And that's basically what the story is about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt : 10\\n\r\nThe art is amazing. Given that the series is pretty new. And we rarely see crappy art nowadays. Every little bit of detail is drawn impressively. Action scenes were really awesome, backgrounds were perfectly drawn. The art on Gargantia is topnotch. No bad thing can be say on Gargantia's art.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 9\\n\r\nCharacters on Gargantia were quite many, and most of them have their own unique traits that compliments other characters. We have our main protag known as Leto, a bishounen in every way you look at him. A soldier who doesn't have any emotions. And his trusty metalhead pal Machine Caliber K6821 or simply Chamber, an AI that supports its pilot in every way it can. And of course, we should have our moe moe girl protag character! Her name is Amy. Amy is your energetic and optimistic girl who really compliments what Leto lacks. She helps Leto in various ways regarding on how to live on Gargantia. Characters were drawn pretty impressive too. Even supporting characters were drawn good. They can be easily identified with just a glance.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic : 8\\n\r\nNo music worth mentioning. Well this ain't K-ON! or Tari-Tari, so don't expect a lot of music. It has 1 opening theme which is good, and 1 ending theme that's quite good too. Its pretty short to have its opening theme and ending theme. So I guess they didn't bother putting a lot of tracks in it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement : 10\\n\r\nI enjoyed it a LOT! I don't know why, maybe because I haven't watched a lot of mecha series before. But anyway, I enjoyed Gargantia a lot, they seem to balance action scenes and giving fanservice. I didn't quite expect the fanservice though, I thought it was focused on a lot of actions. But Gargantia kept it minimal, so I enjoyed it. Who would wanna watch breasts, pantyshots and cleavage? Me! But overall, Gargantia provided me an awesome series I've been longing to watch once in a while.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9\\n\r\nHonestly, at first I thought this series would turn out like your average kiddy mecha series. But damn, I missed badly. Its good, since they seem to balance action scenes a lot, and giving a little bit of fanservice once in a while is good. It is more than your average 13-year-old shounen animes out there, it has a deep story behind it. I love the way they put conspiracy on it! And tragic moments on certain scenes were really amazing. I thought I smelled romance on Gargantia, but then again I was wrong. I guess if they make another season, romance would kinda bloom on Gargantia? Well anyway, the series is reaaaaaal good. It shows how humans can be ambitious and try to break their limits even if its comitting a taboo. For me it was worth every second I've watched it. Hopefully, you too who read this will enjoy it as I did.\\n",

The fact that they can be so totally clueless as to completely misunderstand Gatantia is just proof that the American education system has become pathetic.\r\nGargantia has a pretty standard action/adventure plot. It's about a young soldier from a futuristic civilization that is engaged in an apocalyptic war with alien creatures, who findshimself marooned on a water planet whose inhabitants travel in large communal fleets, fishing and salvaging technology from their pre-flood civilization. (The fleet is the \"Gargantia\" of the title.) It's not long before he discovered that the planet is Earth\u2014the long-lost birthplace of his civilization. That's the plot, but by the end you realize that what it is really about is about is what it means to be human\u2014as an individual, as a society, and as a species. It's a brilliant and beautifully animated true science fiction story. It foes that through a masterful combination of story, plot, and characterization that is enhanced by the beautiful art.",

After seeing the discussion about Gen Urobuchi doing this anime:\r\n    [QUOTE=BigBoss0327;88719]People are going to die in this anime?!?\r\n    I thought it was a happy-go-lucky anime that teaches valuables lessons like the importance of human life and family and stuff...[/QUOTE]\r\n    A rather interesting quote of myself while I was watching the series, little did I know that this is basically the whole reason ofthe anime! This is an anime about the meaning of life. Nonetheless, it was magnificently excecuted if I do say so myself, in fact, you could even say it was executed too well. By that, I mean that this anime was on the level of a MOVIE! Not sure if I was the only one who saw it that way, but this could have easily have been a 5-star anime movie. Something about the art, the plot, the characters.. everything! It was so... movie-like y'know what I mean?? Anyways, the point being that this is high-quality stuff we're dealing with here~ I remember when I saw the 1st episode when it aired I was totally blown away and got a tear in my eye, reminiscing that anime has come a long way to the point where we get quality like this. Well, I can't say much without spoiling, but if you read the summary above, you'll get a pretty accurate idea of this anime is all about ;D\\n\\n\\n\r\n    Characters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n    The characters in Suisei no Gargantia were very impressive IMO. The things about them that stood out to me the most were that they had feelings, and great voice actors~ Even the side/un-important characters had great famous/popular seiyuu! Though the only important ones were Ledo on Chamber through my percepective..\\n\r\n    At the beginnign they introduced many of them, but it was pretty apparent that they disappear and become unimportant to the point where you wonder if there was a reason to introducing them at all. Take Amy for example (the female lead), it's weird and I'm not sure I've seen this in an anime before but the whole time it just felt like she was just \"there\" but she didn't need to be, almost as if they were forcing her character presense. Some sort of twisted and weird fanservice? No matter, it is but a trifling matter that simply irritated me. Also the other girl Bellows, she's introduced in the anime as if she's important or something but in the end even Amy's friend Melty becomes more impactful than her XD It's even arguable that the pirate queen \"Rukkage\" is even more important than her! My point in this rant being that, Bellows and Amy were sort of \"hyped\" in the anime but never really did anything and felt forced IMO. The good stuff though was that Ledo, Chamber and Pinion were excellent in every way.\\n\\n\\n\r\n    Music: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n    Opening/Ending + OST were all very well-done, nothing felt weird or misplaced and like I said earlier.. I'm talking movie-quality. That's the one point I really have to emphasize about this anime. I find it difficult to even call this an anime. It's a movie. I mean, just look at these videos!!? Totally movie-style. Reminds me of one of them Ghibli movies.\\n\\n\r\n    [video=youtube;wSyJgxo3jSE]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSyJgxo3jSE[/video]\\n\\n\r\n    [video=youtube;FAxHH4ofQMw]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAxHH4ofQMw[/video]\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n    Art: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n    All I have to repeat here is... Movie-like-quality. The blu-ray release of this will certainly be impressive~\\n\\n\r\n    Overall Enjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n    Going with MAL ratings, I'll have to give this anime an 8 (Very Good). I have a feeling that it won't be very memorable for me in the future, however if this was a movie, (like a 2/3/4 hour movie) I'd say hands down that it's one of the best I've ever seen. I admit that there were a couple times were I had no clue what was going to happen and that the anime could have taken many different course - but overall I'm pleased with what they did and it was the expected end result.\\n\\n\\n\r\n    FINAL RATE: 45/50\\n\\n\r\n    I loved many anime that the Spring '13 lineup had to offer, though I'd have to say Suisei no Gargantia is one of the more forgettable ones out of the bunch. At the end of the day though, Gargantia is a great watch, packed with colorful animation, a well written story, and interesting characters. It might have been a bit better as a movie, but I came out of Gargantia very satisfied regardless.\\n\\n\\n\r\n    Recommendations:\\n\\n\r\n    - Eureka Seven -\\n\r\n    Out of everything, Suisei no Gargantia reminded me most of this. Setting aside difference between one another and learning about the wonders of life. If you're interested why not check out my review?~\\n\\n\r\n    - Mobile Suit Gundam 00 -\\n\r\n    Following blind orders, being in the future, meaningless fighting amoung ourselves, and the order of power through a type of \"feudalism\". Both these anime are immensely similar in those ways. Find out more about Gundam 00 here.",

            "content": "Before I get into it, I just want to say that I think this show has to be one of my favorite anime I have ever seen. My review of the show will explain why.\r\nStory: When it comes to plot, it does remind me a lot of Ender's Game, but I think the anime does so much better than Ender's Game. Without spoiling too much, I appreciate the story taking place in the stranger's point of view after he's been brainwashed. I have a feeling the idea has been done before, but what I found in comparison to other dystopian anime is that that despitethe dark beginning that foreshadows a very dark ending, the foreign world has brought a very bright light, and the first half of the show was like a breath of fresh air. Also, the transitions between the two halves of the anime works very well, and everything seems to connect. Even after we learn the truth about Ledo's purpose, everything seems to have fallen into place. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: There are a lot of shounen styled anime in this world, but as far as this anime goes, everything is downright beautiful! For something that's a mecha anime, I like how it combines with the interesting battleships as living quarters type setting. The characters are very good looking, and the water seems very real, which is something I never really said about an anime before. I've even got squeamish in the later episodes because the gore was realistic (not human gore, but it's a new type). For a 2013 anime, everything seems like it's new and it's been used for the first time. It's like I'm watching a new version of Gundum, but it's not Gundum in the slightest. (If I spelled that anime wrong, I completely apologize). It's nothing amazing, but it's definitely better than anything I've seen before. For that, I'd rate this part a 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Both opening and ending are absolutely beautiful. I can't stop listening to both of them. Also, the scores inside each episode is very interesting to listen to. Nothing is out of place or anything. It reflects the emotions of the characters very well. And when something gets intense, it shares the same feel without breaking the moment. And if I can say anything about the English dub (because that's what I watched), nothing feels out of place.  The voice actors definitely know how to act as their characters, and there was no voice that I found annoying. Another interesting element is that no matter what version you watch, the languages created for both societies is a new type (like Star Wars cultures or something). There are a lot of things to praise about this section. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Character development is everywhere in this series, especially Ledo. I've seen denser main protagonists from these types of anime before, but Ledo is definitely a new type of character. This is a boy who is internally fighting between what he was taught and what he learned on his own. Ever since meeting the people of Gargantia, he's learn to make friends instead of comrades in battle. He's learned to make peace, but there will always be his past that haunts him. That's what a human being is, and I appreciate that. (I don't want to spoil the rest). Even Chamber has his own character. I mean, he's no Baymax, but it has its struggles between what he was programmed to do and what Ledo wants it to do for the sake of what is right. Another character I want to mention is Amy, Ledo's guide in Gargantia. She's the opposite of your damsel in distress. She is the one person who stands up for Ledo, even if he does make the greatest of mistakes, and she sees the good of all people, and sees what harm the enemies can do if everyone doesn't stand up. The other side characters are very interesting to watch. They have reasons behind what they do, and they definitely make memorable characters from this show. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: In reality, I suppose it depends on the person. However, I'm a person who doesn't really watch mecha anime because I always thought they were the same show, just changing characters' appearances around. However, this show is different. You get a protagonist that's really intelligent and actually learns his lesson. The side characters have backstories and purposes far greater than just being on screen for a couple of minutes. You actually get to know everything and you want to know what the next episode has. I would definitely say 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Well, I've pretty much said what I want. Rounding up the results, it's still a 10/10.",

            "content": "So, Urobuchi has been working with Production I.G. in 2012 with the first project being \u201cPsycho-Pass\u201d and the success of that show got a second season coming soon but with this show and getting a first glance at that and you see it\u2019s not something you expect from him but then again, Madoka Magica was something we didn\u2019t expect to be good and look at that. The same can be said for Fate/Zero but can it happen again with this show? I guess I have to find out.\r\nIn the distant future, mankind has taken to the stars and formed the Galactic Alliance of Humankind (\u4eba\u985e\u9280\u6cb3\u540c\u76dfJinrui Ginga D\u014dmei?). The Alliance is engaged in a perpetual war with a tentacled alien species known as the Hideauze (\u30d2\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30fc\u30ba Hidi\u0101zu?). 16-year-old Ensign Ledo is a soldier in the Galactic Alliance, piloting a Machine Caliber (\u30de\u30b7\u30f3\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc Mashin Kyarib\u0101?), an AI-automated, humanoid-shaped battle suit, which he refers to as 'Chamber'. After a failed attempt by the Alliance forces to destroy an enemy super-weapon, Ledo is knocked into a wormhole and loses consciousness. When he awakens, he learns from Chamber that he has been in cryo-stasis for 6 months while his wounds were healing. Ledo learns that he and Chamber have been 'found' by a rag-tag band of 'primitive' human scavengers. Ledo quickly discovers that he is on board a massive fleet of ships on an ocean-covered planet. Chamber tells him that local star charts reveal the planet is Earth, the birthplace of humanity, a place that members of the Alliance were only familiar with from stories and believed was a myth.\\n\\n\r\nWell, for one thing, the show is actually more tame and light-hearted compared to his earlier works and this is something that I would never picture being written by the same guy who made the magical girl genre wet itself and no, it is not a bad thing that Urobuchi went into a different mode than the usual stuff he\u2019s known for. There is some dark elements into the story but nothing high caliber of Fate/Zero or Madoka Magica. It is more like a sci-fi \u201cfish out of water\u201d tale; a character looks at a world which is more primitive than the one he\u2019s used to and feels more human once he interacts with the people surrounding it and as it goes, it was handled pretty well in planning and execution although it could use a little more in character development and speaking of that\u2026\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe main character Ledo is your basic stoic but strong lead with no knowledge of the planet Earth so you could expect him to not be like the other residents on the ship. Amy, the character that Ledo did kidnap when he was confused about the planet and possibly one of the reasons Ledo fights to protect Gargantia, is quite relevant into Ledo\u2019s development as a character as well as her to an extent as how they bond throughout and also leading to a close relationship between the two whenever they have alone screen time together. As for the other characters, some few get some development like Amy\u2019s two messenger friends Melty and Saaya; Ridget, the high rank officer; Pinion, head repairmen and Bellows, leader of the excavation team but since this is a 13-episode series, most of them are overshadowed to the plot and learning a little bit about them wouldn\u2019t be as bad.\\n\\n\r\nProduction I.G. did a gorgeous job on the animation as this is a very colorful and vibrant looking anime, as in, something I never expect from the likes of Urobuchi and the action scenes with Ledo and Chamber are pretty top-notch and visually stunning. Some character designs, especially on the female characters, do seem kind of moe-like and also Ledo does look very bishonen, which I just suddenly realized now.\\n\\n\r\nThe musical effort was decent in their share. The opening theme Kono Sekai wa Bokura o Matte Ita (\u3053\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u306f\u50d5\u3089\u3092\u5f85\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f?, \"This World Has Been Waiting For Us\") by Minori Chihara did took me time to warm up to it but after listening to it a few times, I actually like listening to it with it being a calm yet adventurous sound, which does sound right for the series and the ending song to Kimi no Message (\u7a7a\u3068\u30ad\u30df\u306e\u30e1\u30c3\u30bb\u30fc\u30b8?, \"Sky and Your Message\") by ChouCho is very serene and soothing, which is a good way to end each episode. So\u2026\u2026\u2026I would say something about the dub\u2026..there isn\u2019t one\u2026.well, not yet of course. The acting in Japanese is fine, although I can\u2019t really tell as much but it was a serviceable performance although some female voices were a bit too high-pitched for my taste.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: This is an Urobuchi show set with a lighter and tamer tone while not straying away from his usual style in some episodes but manages to make it interesting with how he takes it through. While not as grandiose or extraordinary as his other shows he\u2019s written, this one is worth the watch for the story alone.",

            "content": "I usually don't watch seasonal shows that often and for the most part wait until a show finishes airing so I can marathon it. However, I decided to give the Spring season a shot and being a sci-fi fan, Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet looked very interesting to me. On with the review!\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story revolves around a young boy named Ledo who is partnered with an AI robot named Chamber, capable of communicating with the pilot and for combat in space. However, all of that changes when they suddenly arrive on Earth and Ledo has to learn how to adapt to his new environment.What's really interesting is that Ledo spoke a different language before meeting the people who live on the Gargantia ship. He had to use Chamber to communicate with them so they could understand them, at least until he learned their language, which makes the whole situation more realistic. \\n\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\r\nIt's no surprise that the animation is top notch, especially from Production I.G. Everything looks so beautiful from space, the water, the lighting, the environment, which makes it seem more crisp to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe music is solid with the tracks matching up well with the scenes shown throughout the course of the show. While I don't speak Japanese, the sub for the show is good and I can tell the seiyuus sound like their giving a good performance.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nFor the most part, the characters serve their roles well and some of them get some good development. Ledo in particular as he starts off as a silent pilot who's only interested in fighting his enemy, but the more he learns about his new home, the more he adjusts to life on Earth and grows attached to the people he's gotten to know.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nThe series for the most part is pretty solid. It starts off great, but then has a couple of filler episodes in the middle tends to slow the pacing down. However, the ending surprised me as it resolves the problems leading up to it, leaving a satisfying ending. Although, it takes a few episodes in order to get to that point which makes you wonder if the wait will be worth it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nOverall Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet has good character development from the main cast and a setting with circumstances that makes it seem more realistic. It has some flaws, but what's good is really good. If your interested in watching it you can check it out for free on Crunchyroll. Well that's it for now. Hope you enjoyed reading my review, you guys take care.",

            "content": "Since there have been so many reviews of Madoka by now, and we've all become familiar with Gen Urobuchi, I figured I might as well write a review for one of his post-Madoka efforts.\r\nEnough previous reviewers have pointed out the sundry flaws in the narrative, which, yes, was written by several different writers while Madoka and Psycho Pass were largely written by him alone. The rather disjointed middle (including the \"beach\" party) and lead-up to the end reflect this. Some Madoka-haters have used this as \"proof\" that Gen is a bad writer, and fans have claimed he was trying too hard to subvert our nihilisticimpression of him.\\n\\n\r\nBut all that aside, I think he was at least trying there, as were Kazuo Murata (Gargantia's co-creator) and the animation staff. The artwork is gorgeous; you won't see a prettier ocean. The protagonists, though not well-developed (except for Ledo and Chamber) are at least sympathetic and likeable. Even the big plot twist, though somewhat shoehorned in and contrived, raises some thought-provoking questions about humanity, biology, and our fate in the far-distant future, when climatic conditions on Earth may shift beyond anything we've ever experienced.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Gargantia can be summed up as, \"At least they tried. And they didn't do SO bad.\"",

            "content": "Suisei no Gargantia is one of my all-time favorite anime.\r\nI have given it a 10/10 on all aspects but this isn't exaggerating at all how much I enjoyed it. I really can't think of anything that could have been done better.\r\nStory: After arriving on earth, the MC has to overcome the language barrier as well as the many societal and cultural differences that exist between him and the people who find him. I found it entertaining to see the \"normality\" of us humans through the eyes of someone from outer space. (And I thought making friends was hard for ME.)\r\nArt: I think the art isvery well done and the concept of the world is amazing. I love the designs of the characters and outifts. The expressions are easy to read and the animation didn't strike me as lazy at any point. The setting is depicted in an unconfusing way, and the water in particular is breathtakingly beautiful. I can even forgive all the fanservice they inserted because the art and animation is so enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I normally download the soundtracks of animes I like, but I know it's especially good when listening to them again I want to cry. Maybe not everyone is as affected by this as I am. Still, excellent soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Sometimes in manga/anime I come across that one person who just annoys me so much that it sort of ruins it, even though the plot is good. Thankfully this wasn't so for this series. I liked the way all of the characters were portrayed, and none were too black and white. The main character is not perfect and the love interest is an unassuming and practical girl. (Though I should add the romance level is pretty low, which scores more points in my book.)\\n\\n\r\nI am definitely glad I found this anime and decided to give it a try, it was definitely worth it. If you are unsure, it should become clear whether you'll like it or not from just the first episode. I was completely intrigued by it and was not disappointed as I continued to watch.\\n\\n\r\n10/10. For what my opinion is worth, this is a series you won't regret giving a shot.",

            "content": "**I wrote the first part of this after watching the first episode to give a sense of how this series comes across to those well versed in the mecha genre and the rest of the review is written after watching episode 10**\r\n*Also note, I tried to avoid explicit spoilers writing this (all explicit plot spoilers are in footnotes), but there still are some in it because it wouldn't be possible to write a detailed review without talking about some major plot points. The TL;DR version of my opinions on this series so far is: Don't bother watching this yet if you've seen/read a lot ofsci-fi. I say yet because it may get better. If you're new to the scifi/mecha genre, this is probably a great show to jump in on since it introduces a lot of standard sci-fi fare in an easy to digest manner.\\n\\n\r\nBreakdown:\\n\\n\r\nExtremely stereotypical scifi/mecha anime with main characters so archetypal that I was able to determine their personalities after the first episode, except 1. Only 10 episodes so far, so it may be too early to judge, but there has been only very little character development. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is nothing special if you have seen any decent mecha anime (especially if you have seen Eureka 7). There has been 1 (maybe 2) major plot twist(s) so far and I called out both of them by the second episode because they were so painfully obvious. \\n\\n\r\nArt and sound are great, but not exceptional. Colors are vibrant, but sometimes too vibrant. Music in the show is pretty average, nothing amazing/wowing/beautiful as of yet.\\n\\n\\n\r\n>First Episode Impressions\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode starts off as archetypal and cliche as a sci-fi/space/mecha show can begin. The background is introduced and the human alliance is proudly declared as humanity's last hope against the alien menace. Despite the pomp and circumstance of this message, a more sinister undertone is revealed soon after (spoiler 1). \\n\\n\r\nAfter this introduction ends, the main character is introduced and their mission is about to begin (spoiler 2). The main character is the archetypal stoic, duty-bound soldier. As the army of mecha and spaceships head into battle, the show cuts away to the title screen of the first episode (spoiler 3). The battle rages on and whatever the result is, it is entirely inconsequential, as explained in spoiler 3. \\n\\n\r\nThrough whatever scifi mechanism as explained in the show, our protagonist's mecha ends up in a hangar somewhere after the events of the battle and the mecha is being investigated by the people in the hangar, who are obviously completely oblivious to what it is as they seem to be much more primitive (spoiler 4). Several new characters are introduced here and within minutes I am certain of their personalities: \\n\\n\r\n* The younger girl with the brown hair is the carefree, happy-go-lucky love interest who will be torn between trying to understand the protagonist and protecting her friends and family.\\n\r\n*The blonde guy is the gun-ho guy who thinks he can do anything with just their primitive technology and willpower and he has no use for the fancy pants technology. Protagonist will have to learn to cope with doing things by hand in this primitive society and will eventually prove himself to blonde guy.\\n\r\n*The older girl with red hair is the gun-ho female character who will teach our protagonist about the ways of their people. Probably will have some sort of love relationship with the blonde guy.\\n\r\n*Girl in glasses is some sort of duty and honor bound commander who initially distrusts the protagonist, but once he helps them out will reluctantly accept him.\\n\\n\r\nA chase scene ensues and when that is over, it is revealed that we are now on a planet and the primitive society here has no space faring capabilities, meaning there will be a lot of time for the protagonist to grow on this planet as the story develops (spoiler 5). The first episode then ends\\n\\n\r\n>End First Episode Impressions\\n\\n\r\nEven though I felt this show was going to be extremely formulaic and predictable, I decided to give it a chance and watched all the remaining episodes that had been released at the time (Episode 10) and below are my final cumulative thoughts on the show (heavy spoilers)\\n\\n\r\n>Overall Opinion\\n\\n\r\nSo I was right about the protagonist going native and so far it seems my prediction for the supporting cast of characters was dead on with the exception of Pinion (the blonde guy). The First plot twist prediction was also pretty much dead on now that it's pretty much confirmed the aliens are/were actually humans and it's going to be the job of our protagonist to somehow broker a peace between the two sides of the war, perhaps with help of the whalesquids.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the pirates were introduced and then destroyed in episode 2, I predicted that there would probably be some kind of \"pirate king\" who was actually also a soldier from the Galactic Alliance, ruling the pirates through the use of high tech weapons/mechas. I predicted that the interaction between the protagonist and this other GA soldier will most likely be antagonistic. This other soldier may be corrupted and trying to become the ruler of Earth or perhaps he is trying to exploit the primitive Earth natives and return to space and the protagonist will oppose him on philosophical grounds. By the end of episode 10, we find out Commander Kulge's mecha is indeed on Earth, but whether the man is here is another question. I will assume he is on Earth (why else would what seems to be a primitive cult project the silhouette of a mecha into the clouds other than to try and attract the attention of other stranded GA soldiers?). I assume Kulge also arrived on Earth via wormhole/tear in space-time like our protagonist, but it is very likely that he arrived much, much earlier than our protagonist (decades earlier) since they did not travel through the rip in spacetime in tandem and minutes/seconds of separation when entering the rip may result in much longer time differences when exiting. How Kulge and his cult will interact with our protagonist is hard to say, but since it seems like the two had a close relationship in the GA, it will probably be friendly and Kulge (who probably also knows the truth about the aliens) may serve as a mentor to our protagonist. However, it is very possible that Kulge has turned evil or perhaps he became so disillusioned with the GA that he now wants to fight for the aliens/evolvers. The writers have a great opportunity to make this series more interesting by making how this relationship develops completely unpredictable and that's what I'm hoping for and why I'm still watching this show.\\n\\n\r\n*****SPOILERS FOOTNOTES BELOW ******\\n\\n\r\n(spoiler 1): the narration is actually recurring brainwashing propaganda forced into the soldiers' minds during sleep.\\n\\n\r\n(spoiler 2): the soldiers are told that this missions is a do or die mission - that either they succeed in destroying their target or else all of humanity is doomed. Such finality in the VERY FIRST EPISODE of an anime leaves very few choices for what will happen, either they succeed and the rest of the anime is about the soldiers continuing with their missions as they face challenges, OR they fail and the show is about the protagonist fighting for survival against an impossible enemy, OR something happens during the mission that fundamentally changes the setting/storyline currently laid out.\\n\\n\r\n(spoiler 3): \"Castaway\". Immediately this makes it clear that what happens in this \"do or die mission\" is inconsequential. The protagonist has been introduced and \"castaway\" will most likely refer to him. He becomes a castaway soldier and the anime will follow him and not the Alliance he fights for. The only question now is to where/whom will he be castaway to? The alien enemies? An unknown third neutral party like space pirates/cowboys?\\n\\n\r\n(spoiler 4): So now we find out that none of my guesses in spoiler 3 were correct and the protagonist has actually be stranded on some primitive planet and that should immediately bring to mind stories/plots a la Dances with Wolves or The Last Samurai or Avatar. The protagonist is going to go native as a result of either spending a lot of time with the primitives or some as of yet unseen plot point.\\n\\n\r\n(spoiler 5): My guess is that a substantial part (50% or more) of this show will take place on Earth and so, assuming that is true, I asked myself \"What significance does the long lost planet of Earth play in this story?\" Drawing upon my previous experiences with scifi (such as Eureka Seven and the \"Foundation\" series of novels by Asimov), I suspect there will be a plot twist involving some sort of \"origin story\" between Earth, humanity, and the aliens. Perhaps we are all descended from the aliens, perhaps the aliens are/were part of Earth, perhaps humanity's fate is somehow tied with the aliens'. I'm not 100% sure of the reason, but I predict that after his time on Earth, the protagonist will realize we must not kill the aliens, but rather coexist peacefully with them.",

            "content": "The series starts out with a intergalactic war going on with squid like looking creatures and robots reminiscent of Neon Genesis.  Stuff goes wrong and the main character wakes up in an unknown area called earth.  Things are slowly revealed throughout the episodes.  I gave it an overall 7, but that might be rating it a bit high.  \r\nStory(7/10): The story was interesting the storytelling follows the summer, fall, winter, spring type of storytelling archetype.  The story continues in a summer-type feeling all the way till episode 7.  In which the main character learns about the society of theGargantia which is a ship in which people are living on and the world seems to be covered in water.  He has to adjust and learn customs and a culture that greatly differed from his life in space, where the greater good was the most important and people spent most of the their time fighting.  At episode 7 you experience \"fall\" in which the character \"falls\" not literally but metaphorically, his world is rocked by learning about the true nature of himself and his basic existence are put into question.  Finally \"winter\" where the story seems rather bleak and it seems the character has turned his back on what he has learned since coming to earth.  Spring comes, well I think you get the picture, as spring is the time of rebirth/regrowing.\\n\r\nOverall, I personally love this type of way of storytelling, it is easy to follow.  I gave it a 7/10 since it felt familar, as far as the idea and main question of the series of \"what is a human? what is living? What is humanity? I do not believe the story approached these questions in a new way, but it was entertaining.  A main crticism is, 6 episodes were dedicated to summer, which is fine but it dragged on, if this anime had not been finished and I could watch the next episode I would have dropped this during the season and watched it after airing.  Episode 7-13 the pace picks up.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (7/10) There was some gorgeous things in the anime.  A lot of the scenery was gorgeous.  I felt the characters were drawn buy a number of different people.  For instance the 3 young girls and the brother are all drawn in bishoujo/bishounen way.  While the other characters are pretty as well, the roundish faces with big eyes are not as prevalent.  I likes the flying scenes in which they fly on these personal flying contraptions.  The mecha fights weren't very new, as they have all been done before in better ways.\\n\\n\r\nSound:(5/10) Well I can't say I listened to the opening or closing except the first episode.  I did not like them, maybe they fit the anime but I did not like them, so I rated it low.  Nothing outstanding in the general sound or soundtrack.  I thought the voice actors were good and picked out well for their parts.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(6/10): Well other than the main character and his robot AI, I can not say I really loved any characters.  The fact remains all the characters except for them are static characters that do not change in the anime.  While it puts focus of the main characters, there seemed to be a lot of extras that just filled up space (and a lot of useless characters being introduced).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (8/10): while I felt the main question of what is human? What is living? What makes us different than others? Are questions that addressed in a lot of anime, it still does not make me tired of seeing it.  Even if it is a rehashing of old ideas mixed with some new ones, in a different setting.  I love sci-fi and fantasy.  The other stuff (barely there swim suits, beach episode, the death of the old fleet commander) well, what can I say I realize that the anime was not made solely for me (lol).\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7: I feel like it is a little high, but meh I feel like it would be a little sad for it to be a 6 or a 5.  Since I place most points in enjoyment overall, at the end of the day as long as I watched it all the way through it means I liked it a bit.",

            "content": "I'm not the biggest fan of science fiction nor mecha anime and hence I wasn't too keen on watching it in the first place. However, this was based on my first impression when I looked at the cover art. I decided to watch it solely based on the art which I assumed was going to be very good. \r\nIt was indeed. I was pleased to discover that not only was the art pleasing, the plot had me hooked instantly ! Each of the first few episodes raised unanswered questions at the end. The first episode is easily one of the best I've seen in awhile. The characters, especially the main ones, develop and progress at a fair pacing and this, I assume, retained its viewers initially. However, the anime fails to keep this consistency throughout its course and I could almost predict the plot for the following episode as I moved onto the latter half of the anime. I carried on solely because I was curious to see how the characters further developed and the art style which brings me to some aspects that redeem this anime's worth. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style of this anime was very pleasing. The anime showed the contrast between two habitats on earth through excellent use of colour tones, lights and sound. Character development was also very good. As circumstances changed, it was interesting to see how the characters' views changed accordingly. A very strong and relevant moral question is raised and I, as a viewer, kept comparing what I would do with what the protagonist does. This itself made the anime very engaging right towards the end of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I would undoubtedly recommend this anime to anyone who is in the same boat as I was when I was about to watch it. Suisei no Gargantia offers more reasons in favour of watching it than otherwise.",

            "content": "Setting:\r\nSuisei no Gargantia is set in a futuristic world where humanity survives in space, locked in an all-out war with an alien species called the Hidiazu, deadly squid-like aliens.  Without a home planet of their own, and as the war has become increasingly more desperate, civilization has transformed into a militaristic society that eschews personal luxuries in favor of utmost efficiency, naming itself the Galactic Alliance of Humankind.  \"Liabilities,\" such as disabled persons, are euthanized; human reproduction is allowed only under government permission; families are separated at birth and contact never reestablished; and support of an organized military hierarchy given utmost emphasis.Total efficiency and removal of elements of lifestyle deemed unnecessary for basic human survival is a common theme in this series.\\n\\n\r\nWhen one of the interstellar soldiers, our main character Ledo, crashes through a wormhole to land on Earth, this ideal of absolute efficiency becomes called into question.  With Ledo stranded in a foreign world with no apparent quick prospect of returning home, he is forced to come to terms with the current residents of Earth, who live a lifestyle completely opposite to that of the Galactic Alliance of Humankind.  They strain themselves only as much as they need to survive and spend the rest of their time doing whatever pastime they find most enjoyable; none of their day is under organized supervision.  They function in large communities of interlocked naval ships, as this futuristic Earth has become a planet completely covered in Ocean.  The citizens of this world have no knowledge of their space brethren or any extent of their own history, and this lost knowledge has resulted in a technology very primitive in comparison to the Galactic Alliance's.  (It's more in line with our technology as we know it today, albeit their world is still completely different than our own--there are no cars, for example, because they live on the ocean).\\n\\n\r\nMy Opinion:\\n\\n\r\nFor the viewer, we are presented two contrasting lifestyles, developed through the perspective of the main character as he tries to find value in an inefficient lifestyle while simultaneously learning to critique his own upbringing.  Because Ledo is a newcomer into society, the transition of explaining the world feels very natural, as we viewers are able to discover this futuristic Earth along with Ledo.  Although a common theme is this debate between the merits of absolute efficiency or enjoying the pleasures of an impractical lifestyle, don't get your hopes up for a deep philosophical journey.  The anime's focus feels more about telling a story rather than hammering home a meaningful lesson.\\n\\n\r\nIt's first few episodes foreshadow a darker side to the anime, but much of the early episodes are spent on this story-telling, and the anime feels very much like a slice-of-life, where not much happens except for dialogue to present the characters. Despite this, the anime changes pace in the second half, and we are left only really having established strong development with the main character.   I felt the merits in the anime were the interesting setting and story, and I had little connection to anyone besides the main character.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story unfolds, we begin to explore the nature of the conflict with the Hidiazu and reasons for the Galactic Alliance's existence.  This provokes some thoughtful questions for the viewer about our own course of action with developing technologies today or in the near-future.  Unfortunately, this development stops short of providing some sort of didactic or thoughtful  message for the viewer, which left me feeling a little disappointed.  It almost felt like the anime ran out of time to be able to go further into this aspect.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the \"feel\" of the anime was a little divided to me, which I touched upon in the last two paragraphs.  The first half of the anime has a very slice-of-life feel, and character development takes place at the expense of plot development.  The second half of the anime delves into plot development, but it rotates in new characters at the same time--so the character development from before is largely no longer relevant!  Admittedly, this may have still worked out fine had the anime been longer than 13 episodes, but when supporting characters are only becoming apparent or relevant halfway through 13 episodes, it's hard to find time to really build any cohesion between the character cast.  Ultimately, this division of styles felt mismanaged to me.  It's like the pacing was set for a 26 episode anime, as so many aspects feel quite underdeveloped after 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary: Suisei no Gargantia has an interesting story, changes its genre rapidly from slice-of-life to very serious and has ambiguous character development.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a good judge for art, so I won't put my opinion here.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\\n\r\nThe music had a nice track.  The broad nature of the anime meant that it had the opportunity to show its versatility for a variety of situations, from frustrated tears of friendship, to epic battles, anguish over a sad past and embarking on an adventure.  I felt its implementation was rather obtuse, namely in that it was a little over dramatic for whatever scene it was trying to portray.  Still, building a scene is more than just music, so it's not fair to place all of the fault on the music for that.  I felt the music by itself was enjoyable and appropriate.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nSuisei no Gargantia as some moments of highs that feel very good.  It opens some interesting questions through its refreshing and unique plot.  Besides this strong backstory, there's not a whole lot to talk about.  Its presentation and pacing weren't very conducive to a 13-episode anime.  It stops short of really exploring the potential for a meaningful message; at the same time, it also suffers from underdeveloped characters.  It felt like the anime couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a meaningful, deep anime or if it wanted to go with slice-of-life, so it gave a half-job of both.  If you like both styles of anime, then you may enjoy Suisei no Gargantia very much; otherwise, be prepared to find half of the episodes boring.  From a more optimistic perspective, if you've got nothing better to do with your time, you are likely to find half of the episodes quite entertaining.  \\n\\n\r\nI think this is an anime that would stand to benefit very much from a second season, so it could have more time to explore the huge space for potential it has, which could go a long way to shoring up the all-too-brief development it's presented over 13 episodes.",
