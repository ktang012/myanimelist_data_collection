            "content": "Oh, Zankyou no Terror... How much did I praise you during the early few episodes, but how could I know that you will turn out how you did. Zankyou no Terror (Terror in Resonance or Terror in Tokyo in English) was one of my most anticipated titles of the season and I am sure I was not alone. The show also gained a bit of a hype because of the famous Shinichiro Watanabe (Samurai Champloo, Cowboy Bebop), who I am in all honesty no big fan of, but okay, let's get this review started. Just make sure that I will NOT be able to hideall possible spoilers, so just read this review if you have already finished the show or dropped it and don\u2019t consider picking it up again! Or if you just don\u2019t care about spoilers...\\n\\n\r\nThe plot, or rather the premise, was what caught my attention and interest at first. \u201cAn anime about terrorism?\u201d Sounds thrilling alright, but sadly it turned out to be quite a train wreck with lose plot and lackluster characters in the long run. Basically the show is about two special kids, who build bombs and make them explode, but with no people around so nobody gets hurt. That\u2019s a weird characteristic for two young blooded terrorists, but there are reasons for this, obviously. And they announce their terrorist attacks on YouTube and ask the police riddles, so they may or may not stop the bomb from going off. That\u2019s what I was thought to be quite interesting and I was hoping for there to be a message behind the bombings and some deeper meaning and connections, but sadly that wasn\u2019t so.  Either I didn\u2019t get them, or the riddles were just there to make the show appear smart. The show generally shows its story from two perspectives, from the bomber\u2019s, naming themselves \u201cSphinx\u201d, and the police\u2019s perspective. What I found somewhat disappointing that there was no real tension during the moments when the investigations took place and the investigation process went waaaay too easy. I mean the main detective, Shibazaki, seemingly knows all of Greek mythology (that\u2019s what the riddles are mostly based on) and at one point he clears a riddle because he watches his fat friend play a video game. It reminded me of some cheap Hollywood movie in which the protagonist finds out some very important clue due to something a kid spouts. I\u2019m sure you know what I am talking about.\\n\\n\r\nHow the story played out felt a bit cheap in general. I mean Shibazaki (together with \"Five\" in the middle part of the anime) was the only one driving the plot along thanks to his super knowledge and his daughter who knows a lot about bombs and nukes. Also in the end he meets a few men who willingly agree to just tell him everything he wants to know in fullest detail, just because.\\n\\n\r\nAnother point when the show took a huge nosedive in my opinion, was when a former \u201cfriend\u201d of the main characters \u201cNine\u201d and \u201cTwelve\u201d was introduced as their nemesis, called \u201cFive\u201d. Five was basically the point on when I almost gave up on the show. She seemed just like a psychotic woman who had to stop Sphinx because the US said so. And to do this she went overboard multiple times, resulting in countless casualties, damages and wounded innocents along the way, for a ridiculous, nonsensical and compleely unjustified reason and motivation if you ask me. And she also did pointless and silly riddles with bombings, which the main characters now had to solve and disarm\u2026 While the character of Five was not complete useless, I do agree that she shouldn\u2019t have been there. They should have spent more time on the \"important characters\" and explore those more. Speaking of which.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole cast of characters was so lackluster, with barely any real explained motivations or fleshed out ones among them, the only decent one being the detective Shibazaki. He was the only one advancing the plot, but even this with the most trivial and convenient ways possible, like I told you before. I mean his relative and one friend gave away the location of the bomb in the last episode, oh my, how convenient indeed. It was so cheap I had to face palm. A lot of answers to the already mentioned riddles by Shibazaki where really sudden and there was never a clear train of thought to follow either him or the actual main protagonists, which was a shame. This could have been a great cat and mouse game like in Death Note, but it was not. There isn\u2019t much to talk about the two male main characters to be honest. Nine was the rather cold and distant guy, while Twelve was the funky and hyperactive one. They have flashbacks to their past every now and then, when the plot feels like it, and that\u2019s about it. We literally learn everything there is to them in the first two episodes, with their motivations being revealed in the very last episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe last character I want to mention is Lisa, Sphinx\u2019 female sidekick. She has a highly clingy mother and got bullied in school, that\u2019s where she first met Nine and Twelve, which was the most convenient and cheapest way to introduce her, because for whatever reason Sphinx joined a local school in episode 1, but where never ever seen there again, which makes it pointless and the yet again really, really cheap. Her relation with her mother seemed like an important plot point in the beginning, but was quickly abandoned and never talked about again, which is quie a shame. The only things she then really did where trying to cook for Sphinx, but messing up, helping them out a few times, but messing up, staying at home, but messing up and so on. She also gets kidnapped a few times to drive the plot along, but contributed nothing important or meaningful to the story whatsoever. As you can see, the writing is not really strong with this one. Sadly this doesn\u2019t change in the later episodes as well and even the conclusion was everything else than satisfying and quite anticlimactic. They basically shoved everything we already assumed down our throat in the most forced way possible, though at least it is complete and not inconclusive. That\u2019s a plus.\\n\\n\r\nBut thankfully the show is good in two aspects; visuals and sound. The animation was really good for the most part and especially in the first episode gorgeous. The explosions were fluent, the attention to detail on backgrounds and characters remarkable and the use of lighting and shadows impressive too. But sadly the anime has a few quality drops during its duration of 11 episodes and often likes to use 3DCG to animate even two background characters, which is really cheap and effortless if you ask me. Characters tend to lose a lot of detail once they move away from the screen too. Nothing new, but when the show does want to look good, it certainly does. The other thing I want to mention is the soundtrack by the famous Yoko Kanno (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Cowboy Bebop, Jin-Roh), which was done very well and especially during the show\u2019s high points in the last couple of episodes, the soundtrack really stood out. One particular scene being one scene in a Ferris Wheel, which was in all honesty my favorite moment of the show. The voice acting was solid, but no performance really stood out or caught my ear.\\n\\n\r\nBut even with all these flaws, Zankyou no Terror was one of my most anticipated shows each week during the summer 2014 season. The whole thrill of how things can turn out, what will happen next, really thrilled and captivated me, only to be let down again and again\u2026\\n\\n\r\nOkay, let\u2019s get to the verdict.\\n\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror was such a huge letdown for me in multiple aspects. This begins at the flow of the story, tons of unanswered questions and thin writing, the flat and weak characters and the unsatisfying, yet complete, conclusion of the show\u2019s plot. Zankyou no Terror could have been a great comment on terrorism and a huge controversial thing to talk and discuss about, but sadly it turned out to be a cheap and forgettable popcorn flick with fancy visuals and good music. Don\u2019t worry, Sphinx. I will remember you. I will remember you for being in a show with the first good English I heard in a long time and in my biggest disappointment of summer 2014.

            "content": "I'll start this review by saying I started watching this show with no prior knowledge about the writers and the premise, so I had no idea what to expect. What I found was a mature and compelling story that kept me entertained throughout the season.\r\nEven in such an amazing season, it managed to shine through as the anime that defined the summer of 2014. Even compared against such great shows as Gekkan shoujo, Tokyo Ghoul, RE:Hamatora and Aldnoah;Zero, Zankyou no Terror stood on top.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThere are many stories that focus on anti-heroes and terrorism, yet none have come close to the level of maturity foundin ZnT. This shows succeeded in areas that other shows such as Death Note faltered. You will find no edgy character development here; no shonen-esque elements. This is the kind of show that you could quite happily show to any non-anime orientated friends with confidence that they won't leave mid-way through, or that you will have to justify why so-and-so is making unnecessary fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of ZnT perfectly fits the tone of the show. There are many still-life scenes in ZnT, and each one perfectly captures the essence of Tokyo. After seeing Tokyo rendered in both Tokyo Ghoul and Tokyo ESP, the realistic  calming images in ZnT were a breath of fresh air. \\n\\n\r\nThe character design also mirrors the art style: realistic enough to provide a sense of severity, yet different enough to give the show an underlying artistic element.\\n\\n\r\nDespite some background characters lacking detail in some parts, this is expected for the first release of an airing show and does no detract from the overall excellence. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are very few shows in which I decide to buy the OST, and even fewer in which I will continue to listen to the songs many weeks later. These songs bear a strong resemblance to 'songs from a cold country' which is a phrase that will become clear if you watch ZnT. In short: the sound is beautiful, elegant and very melancholic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\\n\r\nBoth 9 and 12 have starkly contrasting personalities: 9 being blunt and mature with 12 being childish and playful. Lisa describers them as having'a smile like the sun and eyes like ice'. However it goes far deeper than that. Underneath 9's calm exterior lies indescribable grief, and under 12's smile lies a form of severity to match 12s.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point many watchers would criticise Lisa fir being 'bland' or simply a plot device. However it is impossible to imagine the show without her. Not only does she create a contrast, with her troubles with her mother against 9 and 12 orphan statues, she shows a great deal of development over the show's progression.\\n\\n\r\nFinally I will touch on the characters in the police force, and how ZnT manages to capture adults in such an appropriate way. The police are neither shown as mindless soldiers, nor as clumsy un-organised oafs, and although the duo play along with them, the police are never antagonised. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFrom episode 1 I was hooked. No other show kept my interest like ZnT. Now that it is over I feel as if I have gained something from the experience\\n\\n\r\nTo summarise, Zankyou no Terror showed a level of maturity and elegance I never expected from anime, and it is my hope that other shows in the future will learn from ZnT. \\n",

            "content": "Zankyou No Terror is not a show about terrorism. \r\nBefore you roll your eyes and point your finger at the obvious \u201cTerror\u201d emblazoned in the title, I am serious on this one. While the topic is addressed at times, the crime thriller genre is merely a tool the show wields to sculpt out its socio-political commentary on Japan. If you are expecting a deep-seated exploration of the subject of terrorism, this show will not satisfy you. So please chuck those expectations into the trash and enjoy the show for what it is. Zankyou No Terror tells an engaging tale of generational conflicts, post-war nationalism, isolationfrom modern society and the hopeful rebellious spirit of youths.\\n\\n\r\nThe story kicks off in a grounded, realistic setting of present day Tokyo. 2 teenage terrorists, who go by the names of Nine and Twelve blow up the Tokyo Metropolitan Government building, and in the process accidentally involves a girl called Lisa Mishima. Flashbacks reveal Nine and Twelve to have escaped from a mysterious institution when they were children, hence cloaking their motivations in mystery. From then on, the show continues its crime procedural routine that lasts for a few episodes: Nine and Twelve would plant a bomb, release a video on Youtube under the name \u2018Sphinx\u2019 and challenge the police to solve a given riddle before the next bomb explodes. All the riddles are based on the Greek tragedy Oedipus Rex, and interesting choice that gives the audience parallels to think about- especially the idea of patricide and sacrifice in the pursuit of truth. We also get introduced to Shibazaki, a detective who gets caught up in the cat and mouse game against Sphinx. He is a character whoe has been casted out from society just like Sphinx and Lisa. These first few episodes are thematically condensed and provide solid insights into modern society.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Zankyou No Terror are not complex, after all, the show is more thematically-focused as compared to being character-focused. Zankyou No Terror is not condoning the main characters\u2019 acts of violence, rather, it wants the viewers to reflect about why they were forced into committing those acts.  The show does succeed in evoking the emotional depths of its main terrorist duo and Lisa: the need to escape from the clutches of modern society, the youthful drive to challenge the world that rejected them, the yearning for human connection. This would not have been possible without the brilliant aesthetics and production, which are definitely the show\u2019s strongest point. The polished direction is among the best in recent memory, taking the viewing experience to a cinematic level at times. The show efficiently manipulates camera angles and colour palettes to heighten atmosphere, while the lighting frames the scenes purposefully, stirring up a sense of alienation. Yoko Kanno absolutely delivers when it comes to the Icelandic-inspired soundtrack- the music is a blend of acoustic and electronic that sets the mood perfectly, constantly evoking the melancholy felt by the characters. It brought in the pathos needed to execute the best moments of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOf course the show is not without its faults, which mostly lie in the script. The show takes a generic popcorn thriller route at times, and when you have a show that is rooted in realism (even referencing Tor and virtual currency), many events ended up requiring suspension of disbelief, which might put off some viewers. This fault appeared with the introduction of the show\u2019s antagonist, Five, an agent deployed by the U.S government. The intervention of the US highlighted the problematic relationship between Japan and U.S., but Five came off too cartoonish. As a childhood friend of Nine and Twelve from the mysterious institution, her abnormal upbringing might have been the reason for her hugely childish behavior, but she often went overboard with her dramatic theatrics. The setup of her plans were ridiculous and Hollywoodesque, which led to silly contrived scenarios that clashed with the tone of the show. When her arc came to a close, she was cast in a more humanized and sympathetic light, but her character did more harm than good to the show. Thankfully, the show picked up again afterwards, where it made an interesting choice in joining the narrative with the ongoing issue of Japan\u2019s rising nationalism.  \\n\\n\r\nIn spite of its shaky narrative, Zankyou No Terror is a show that presented relevant themes and concluded with an emotional ending. The show does not fully dig into its themes or answer the questions raised, but it articulates its reflections on society well and its best scenes are truly memorable and affecting. It is an ambitious and passionate production with plenty of substance to appreciate. \\n",

            "content": "In a season filled with giant robots, teenage dramas and supernatural violence, Zankyou no Terror stands out from the usual crowd with its focus on the rarely explored subject matter of terrorism.  Shinichir\u014d Watanabe, renowned director of Cowboy Bebop,  Samurai Champloo, and Kids on the Slope, once again teams up with Yoko Kanno and the newly formed Studio MAPPA to delivers one of the highlights of the summer season 2014.  \r\nZankyou no Terror or Terror in Resonance, opens up with two mysterious male teenagers named Nine and Twelve, carrying out a heist at a nuclear fuel reprocessing facility and ends up stealinga device that contains plutonium. Six months later, in the sweltering heat of summer, both of them, call themselves Sphinx, commit a series of terrorist attacks on Tokyo under and caught up in their schemes, is a teenage girl named Mishima. Through a series of circumstances, she willingly becomes an accomplice in their plans to pull the trigger on the world. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nHaving spent their entire lives together, I felt that Nine and Twelve are two sides of the same coin with the same intentive goals in mind but exhibiting different mannerism as they go about their terrorism business. Nine is your emotionally distant teenager in glasses and approaches the work of Sphinx in a business-like manner. The Ying to Nine's Yang, Twelve more like a playful cat than anything else by the way he plays with a grenade as if it was a ball and prefers to drive a motorcycle when speeding his way through traffic.  Both of them are extremely  intelligent and  physically capable and they soon make short work of anyone sent to apprehend them.  The catch is that, while their acts of terrorism causes an enormous amount of damage, they are setup in such a manner that no fatal causalities occur. It is to the testament to Watanabe's skill that viewers can relate to characters like Nine/Twelve instead of the psychopathic monsters that the mainstream media often demonize terrorists as. \\n\\n\r\nCompletely opposite to the our males in every way possible is a female highschooler named Lisa Mishima. She comes across Twelve during their demolition of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building and given a choice between dying or becoming a member of Sphinx, she chooses the latter. Casted out by society due to her broken family and being the constant target of bullying by her classmates, Lisa garners a fair bit of compassion from me. While I was sympathetic to her situation in the earlier episodes, as the series went on, my patience began to wear thin at just how inept this depressed teenage girl is at everything. It would be too much for me to expect that she would turn into a goddess of terrorism but a little more usefulness out of her would have gone a long way into fostering that emotional connection with the audience.  I do admit, realistically speaking, for a bumbling depressed schoolgirl to be involved with such large-scale destruction, Lisa plays that role to a T.\\n\\n\r\nHot on the heels of Sphinx is Shibazaki, a former ace detective who comes back to active duty as he  successfully decrypts the various riddles. He certainly doesn't fall short in the characterization department  as I perfectly understood his motivations when comes to stopping Nine/Twelve. Being an old grizzled man filled with experience, he has the demeanor  of a mature adult who is very committed to the idea of justice. At the same time, he does have these nonchalant moments that make him feel like a real investigative veteran accustomed to the norms of the world. \\n\\n\r\n Even though Lisa did get a little on my nerves, I did genuinely  enjoyed all the characters and their journey throughout the show for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nFor the most part. \\n\\n\r\nFive\\n\\n\r\nOf course, even though the next major character is a bit of a spoiler, I cannot ignore the effect that Five had on the show when she is introduced partway through the story. Being the primary antagonist by working against Sphinx and subjugating the Japanese law enforcement agencies, she is, by far the weakest part of Zankyou no Terror. Clad in a sailor school uniform, she brings an wildly overbearing presence into the story with her antics and games. The first of two issues that I have with her is that she seemed too omnipotent when facing off with the already formidable Sphinx and damages much of the grounded realism that the show sets itself up as. Second,  I could dismisses her bat-shit crazy actions if her character had an interesting motivation and background but Zankyou no Terror drops the ball in that aspect leaving only hints of what might have been a fantastic villain. It's not that I wish that Five didn't exist but I want to see her character be rewritten in a way that was more restrained and  fleshes out her story. That being said, she was anything but dull and was at least entertaining, even when her actions didn't jive with the core plot. \\n\\n\r\nVisuals and Sound\\n\\n\r\nAccompanying our band of teenage terrorist on their quest for vengeance is the stellar soundtrack by anime legend, Yoko Kanno. Having worked on Cowboy Bebop, Ghost in the Shell: SAC and Macross Frontier fame, she produces a sound that is insidious, subversive and unsettling for the viewers. With haunting guitar riffs, subtle electronic beats and jazzy undertones coupled with the occasional outburst of sound during action scenes, Yoko Kanno skillfully tailored her composition to suit the gritty tense atmosphere of Zankyou no Terror. \\n\\n\r\nStudio MAPPA has done an absolutely breathtaking job when it comes to the animation quality and comes close to what is expected of an anime movie instead of an ordinary TV production. One of the first things that viewers will notice are the muted colors and attention to detail that is intended to sets up modern-day Tokyo to be as realistic as possible. Backgrounds are expertly detailed from the reflective sheen on vehicles in traffic to the cluttered mess of a former detective's office to a Ferris wheel glowing in the rainy night sky as it carries its passengers on a ride. When it comes to 3D CGI, which is often a tricky thing to balance out in anime, it done to support the various angles and scene composition to gives Zankyou no Terror its cinematic quality. Although Studio MAPPA is still a newcomer in the industry, it has demonstrated it has the talent and potential to become a powerhouse within anime. \\n\\n\r\nThemes\\n\\n\r\nAside from the very pretty explosions,  Zankyou no Terror has pretty of depth to draw from with its ideas of a increasingly modernized society and its pitfalls while alluring to ancient mythology. By incorporating fancy pieces of technology like Twitter, YouTube and virtual currency as well , it makes the viewers think about the fragility of our current reality. Although, it doesn't provide any answers, Watanabe's work is certainly more than capable of generating an immense amount of discussion as to what it all means for the characters and our current world.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion \\n\\n\r\nFrom the very beginning, I knew that Zankyou no Terror was going to be one of the very top shows from the summer season and maybe even earn a very rare 10/10 score from me. The question was whether it would be able to maintain the standard set out by the initial episode and the answer teeter somewhere between an 8 and 9. Lisa and Five certainly didn't do the show any favors as they could have as they represented the polar opposites of either being useless or completely all-powerful and insane. If Lisa would have been a little more capable and Five was toned down while given a complete back story, I would be incline to award higher marks overall. Other than those two flawed characters, every other aspect of Zankyou no Terror, from the distinct soundtrack by Yoko Kanno to the cinematic visual direction of Watanabe and his take on the touchy subject of  terrorism mixed in with a little conspiracy, is certainly not lacking in quality nor relevancy. \\n\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "If you had a tough childhood, blow up an atomic bomb.\r\nZankyou no Terror is an original psychological thriller show. It is a different take on terrorism, and received massive hype during its airing for supposedly \"thrilling\" and \"realistic\" execution. However, what's the anime really about? A couple of kids running around bombing stuff to solve their problems.\r\nPlot:\r\nA video on the internet regarding a mysterious group called \"Sphynx\" gets the attention of Japan after unknown people destroy a Tokyo Government building. Nine and Twelve, children with number codenames and the masterminds behind the terrorism act, begin their game of riddles where the result of failure isa bomb detonation, while leaving subtle messages behind the bombings.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is seemingly very intriguing and unique at first, with the audience starting to wonder what's this all about and what's the point behind it. Sadly, that ends with the premise. Nothing really important happens from the main plot in this show. It's summed up very easily - a bunch of kids are playing a riddle game in hopes for someone to come and solve their problems, all of this with a bomb twist. The way they wanted to make this all happen is incredibly stupid and unlogical, and it just becomes obvious that explosions exist for the sake of explosions.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no real depth or a message this anime wants to translate: everything is just extremely shallow. We get no idea as to why the main characters wanted to approach the situation this exact way, or how the hell did they manage to do it. It is praised as being \"very innovative - exploring the society's problems in a unique way\", and dear god that's just so wrong. Despite the popular belief, and that the anime thinks it has that, there's actually no terrorism in this show. \"Terror\" as a word means \"to frighten\". \"Terrorism\" - acts that are intended to create fear, are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal or for demands. None of these things apply to the show, sans the last one which is so subtly hinted that it is impossible to derive it in such a way without relying on massive amount of plot conveniences. (which this anime uses for god knows how many times). Fear doesn't exist in the show, because there's no global perspective - it feels like the bombings are just an everyday thing and nobody cares much that their lives are constantly in danger. So what do we get? A useless plot element. It is just suprising why the characters don't do the first logical thing possible and instead create an extremely unlikely plan that is almost sure to not work (but because of plot convieniences, that becomes possible) and has the exact same result in the end.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of the show suffer from being one-dimensional and uncharacterized. The main protagonists, Nine and Twelve, have their own personality traits (Twelve being sweet and easy-going, Nine being serious and determined), but that's about it. Their backdrop is hinted to be something extremely horrible, but it is never elaborated in the show. Instead, the fragments of their backstory just randomly inserted, and it is impossible to actually guess the scale of importance of the events in their past until much later in the anime, when it comes off as very disappointing and underwhelming reveal. The main problem with the protagonists, though, are that they just don't fit to be terrorists. The show attempts to please the casual viewers by making the main characters a pair of teenagers that are super smart, but it forgets to also give enough of a motive for them to start doing what they're doing this exact way and not just going to the police and tell them what the hell happened in their past.\\n\\n\r\nThe pair is joined by Lisa, who receives a lot of attention early on, but nothing happens with her character. She joins the duo simply to be a plot device and to drive the conflict of Five and the protagonists the way the anime wants to it to go. She has her own personal problems, but they're not focused on, and she just comes off as a dull character with a clumsy trait. She receives no reasonable development and apart from one scene, extremely irrelevant to the story, so it's really sad to see the potential and the focus shown to her early on being wasted.\\n\\n\r\nNext on we have the antagonist Five. Okay, she is an extremely stupidly written character. Her motives are contradicting, she gets the same cliched antagonist traits and actually is irrelevant to the end result. I personally have no idea why she was needed in the anime, most of the logical inaccuracies happen around her, and she is a fresh air of \"generic\" in a rather unique anime. The anime just wasn't fit to include a character like her, and that can be witnessed in her last scene in the show which was probably the stupidiest thing I've ever seen in anime this year.\\n\\n\r\nThe best character of the show is Shibazaki, and he's a friggin plot device. That's how sad it is. He is the \"plot convienience\" Sphynx was searching for to fulfill their insanely unlogical and impossible plan. Shibazaki gets some character development, has some sort of a character backstory that is somewhat believable and reflects on his current character quite well, but he gets pushed into a side role after Five is introduced. His personal drama wasn't elaborated much, but he was the only character on which \"the rule of cool\" worked. It was much more enjoyable and believable to watch him solve the riddles than witnessing Sphynx presenting them (why so serious?)\\n\\n\r\nThe side cast doesn't really exist in this show. Everything revolves around 4 (5 with Shibazaki's sidekick) characters in a story that actually has the entire population of Tokyo in direct influence. All other characters are just plot devices that are there to assume a certain position and for the anime to have realism in this aspect, but they are completely irrelevant. And since the next segment is going to talk about how there's no realism in this show at all, the above point becomes moot.\\n\\n\r\nWriting:\\n\\n\r\nAnd here we go. The most pretentious anime of the year. Let's start off with the impossibilities. It is IMPOSSIBLE to have no casualties after you destroy such a massive building. 9/11 had around 300 people killed on ground level, excluding the firefighters which is another 300. Total number of injured people was 7000. Here, we have no casualties even though the entire evacuated group happened to be next to the building when it exploded, and a mere 50 injuries. That's just so bullshit and immediately kills any immersion. You have a girl jumping from the 4th floor on the ground and she doesn't even get her legs broken, let alone a scratch or bruise? Are you seriously telling me two teenagers stole a friggin atomic bomb from a mass security nuclear facility? And are you seriously telling me the government took 0 actions to find out more about that and locate the stolen bomb before the attacks started happening? And it's just the first episode, guys. There's atleast dozen occurences of straight up impossible and illogical bullshit in every episode. It slows down between the second and the fourth episode, and that's where I thought the anime could actually be good but shit hits the fan again when Five is introduced and we witness the greatest chess game ever - using airport terminals.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the riddles, the whole method is stupid and over the top. The duo needed the exact guy who was willing to research them this exact way, and they found a guy not only willing to do that but who was also a part of an incident which involved someone affiliated with their problem - what are the odds! We are never shown how they plant their bombs or how they manage to create them - everything already seems to be completed and in place and then we just need to wait for a boom. The pair are terrorists, but it was cringe-worthy watching them go nuts over a bomb which couldn't be defused, and that they could be labeled as murderers. The fact is that if this anime followed any string of proper logic, they would already be murderers at the very first bombing.\\n\\n\r\nThe thriller part is done very, very weakly. The whole thriller is that the audience doesn't know what the characters know but don't reveal because TENSION! That's not thrilling to watch, that's just f*cking frustrating. Their whole story is very predictable, it is very obvious that something happened in their childhood and they wanted revenge but there wasn't enough motive to start blowing stuff up, as the scale of events in their childhood wasn't so bad or shocking, and they were probably too young to understand all that. We have no information on what happened inbetween their childhood and the present events, and the duo talks like the Rising Hope Academy thing happened yesterday, when in reality anyone would most likely forget it over time (and sure as hell wouldn't start blowing up the city). The anime tries to make everything complex and mature and deep but everything comes out so messy that even a 10 year old child could write a more fluent script than this.\\n\\n\r\nThere is just way too much to talk about in this section, but I need to keep this short enough and not to spoil anything. The anime is not clever, it is pretentious. It tries to be something that it's not, and tries to be something that it fails to be. Since the show relies solely on being \"logical\" and \"thrilling\", if there are no other elements to get hooked to, you simply cannot enjoy this show because it's not \"logical\" and \"thrilling\". The only thing that is positive and worth mentioning is that there's no fanservice in this show. The comedy is very very little but it doesn't fit, but because there's almost none of it that's not a problem.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nCredit will be given where credit is due. Animation looks salad in this one, especially the explosions. The character designs are okay, although Five looks like a clown for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I would like to talk about more is the soundtrack. Yoko Kanno nails one yet again. It is the best soundtrack of the year, with amazing piano arrangements and dramatical music fitting perfectly with the atmosphere. Standalone songs, such as \"Hanna\", are just amazing to listen. Overall, soundtrack is the only thing I really enjoyed in this show, and I have no complaints and arguments against it. The sound is also well made, the explosions sound realistically, especially in the last episode. The only complaint I have in the sound department is the awful Engrish and subpar voice acting in general, although Shunsuke Sakuya did a good job voicing Shibazaki.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening to the show is beautifully animated with decent music, but strangely enough, it doesn't fit with the anime at all. What is overlooked is the ending to the anime, which is simply animated but has some beautiful music and I ended up enjoying it way more than the opening.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\\n\r\nZankyou No Terror is the definition of a pretentious anime, and a victim of the Code Geass R2 syndrome. It is overhyped because it is \"different\" in execution and the themes. Mind if I tell you, that being \"unique\" is not automatically being \"good\"? It has an amazing soundtrack, but I suggest just buying the OST album instead of watching this, if it's just for the music. Overall, a disapponting watch, but if you want something pretentiously clever you could check this out.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 3.9/10",

            "content": "**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**\r\nFrom the ensemble of Watanabe and Yoko Kanno who brought us Cowboy Bebop, comes together once again to bring us a work that has quickly garnered attention from the anime community, Zankyou No Terror. It's easy to see why ZnT will catch the eye of the masses. And it's even understandable why, to some degree, it receives such positive praise. In a time where the anime community is saturated with school rom coms, run of the mill fanservice moe blobs and bishounen \"self insert\" plot armored protagonists, ZnT certainly has a refreshing change of pace. It brings a concept to the tablethat allows a much needed  breather from the monotonous mass produced clones. However a good concept is only good if executed well. And this is where the line is drawn between those that offer immense praise and others who don't take things at face value. \\n\r\nYou see ZnT is a notorious example of an anime using the 'Bait-and-switch' method to draw an audience in. It 'baits' you in by offering a premise involving terrorism and  then 'switches' to a show that provides social criticism of it's government. Because of this concept, ZnT is given a mirage of bloated self importance. Although you'll be hard-pressed to freely share actual criticism of it's missteps since this show has given rise to a rabid fanbase that will chew your heard off for uttering a single word of disagreement.\\n\r\nWithout question ZnT can be credited with great presentation and production values but that's all superficial qualities and doesn't inherently equate it to actual quality. With everything that ZnT had going for it, it seem to have forgotten the key elements that separates a solid show from one that HAD the potential to be a solid show.\\n\r\nToday we'll break apart the categories of Story, Characters, Art, & Sound to point out where this show with unrepresented potential went wrong.\\n\\n\r\nFirst lets get the obvious areas in which it excels out of the way\\n\r\n[Art/Animation & Sound: 9.5/10 & 9/10]\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation for ZnT was top-tier in almost all aspects. Every scene was gorgeous from beginning to end, with great attention to detail and proper use of shading and lighting in every frame. The  fluid aesthetics breathed life into every scene and helped to make the choreographed actions displayed to have weight behind it. This was further heightened by the creator's mastery of cinematography. From the unique camera angles, to the unorthodox shot compositions, to the camera panning, everything gave off a cinematic look. This made immersion almost instantaneous. It's a firm grip on presentation that's worthy of admiration and praise.\\n\r\nThe color palettes were also used to optimum affect with a clear understanding of color placement and color theory. They were changed in accordance to the mood the show was trying to convey. To the bleached acid washed look of a hot summer day, to a dark shrouded room that gave a sense of isolation. Every color choice and shading felt intentional and properly utilized. The character designs weren't all unique but for the most part they were a cut above the rest. They served their purpose in establishing the traits of the individuals even before we hear them talk. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nLike the animation, the sound was no exception, being the best soundtrack I've heard in ages. But that's to be expected when the talented Yoko Kanno is the one behind it. The tracks came in various forms, most predominantly ambient and melancholic vocals. Every scene was accompanied with an impressive score, that shared great chemistry with the accompanying actions showed. It also have the honor of being the among the few soundtracks I've been compelled to download right off the bat. Standout tracks being \"hanna\" , \"von\" , \"is\", \"walt\" and many more. It's a great stand alone listen and one I've revisited several times.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNOW, time to address the issues that many turn a blind eye too.\\n\r\n[Characters & Story: 2/10 & 3/10]\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThese characters aren't even treated as actual people. More like a range of archetypes and plot devices. They simply slap on a grim backstory and act like that's enough to be called \"characters\"\\n\\n\r\nTo quickly run them down you have:\\n\\n\r\n9 = your intellectual \"according to plan\" stone faced archetype \\n\r\n12 = your innocent turn \"sadistic psycho\" at a drop of a hat archetype\\n\r\nShibazaki = the veteran detective guy. You know, the guy you find in every single cop/mystery show in media's existence\\n\r\n5 = the 1 note psychotic bitch archetype\\n\r\nand Finally Lisa, the \"can't do anything right\" girl.\\n\\n\r\n9 & 12 despite being our MCs have nothing outside of a sad backstory and archetype throughout the shows run, and with that said there's very little worth mentioning about them. They simply exists to commit the terrorist acts from which we will discuss soon.\\n\r\n5, Shibazaki and Lisa  were your plot devices. 5 serving no true purpose as an antagonist other than being evil for the sake of being evil, was just thrown in to foil 9 & 12's plans. Her quirky out of place characteristic destroys all the real world aspects the show crafted by being as bombastic and over the top as possible. And the biggest sin of her as a character is that she added absolutely nothing to the shows overall story. This in turn makes the middle portion involving her feel like filler. I dare you to rewatch the anime after completion and skip the scenes with her involvement and prove me wrong. A show given a short 11 episode runtime and half of it was essentially unnecessary. \\n\r\nLisa serves no purpose outside of being the punching bag/sympathy token character that always fuck shit up. She was also a huge missed opportunity for actual development from the rest of the stagnant cast. Shibazaki being the only character that felt... well, like a character, was given less screentime so Lisa can continue to go around being a damsel in distress.  By dumbing everyone down, Shibazaki is made to be a genius detective, while the rest of cops are made out to be bumbling buffoons.\\n\r\nAlso the show is guilty of treating the US government as a 1 dimensional Saturday morning cartoon type of villainous group, which doesn't help with immersion. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nNow it's not a bad thing that ZnT strayed from it's initial premise, many other shows have done it before. But when the concept is stripped bare-bones what's really left is a tail of kids that perform drastic measures in order to get noticed. Despite the show's down to earth setting it asks the viewer to suspend their disbelief to think that their acts of terrorism don't affect anyone. When does blowing up a building, that possibly provided hundreds of jobs, not be considered a harmful act? Because they made sure it was vacant? These actions are played out with a cinematic flare but the actual ramifications of said actions are never even brought up. Not to mention the thousands of lives that may have possibly depended on that source of income from working in those targeted facilities.  When do we as viewers decide that a couple of kids false sense of conviction is not illogical. Or when do we question the incompetent way the entire populace of Japan and the police are treated. For a show that is trying to be \"down to earth\" how can it excuse a country that's ranked #1 in education in the world, but can't figure out such mediocre riddles that's broadcast for all to see it. \\n\r\nBut you don't have to take my word for it--> http://worldtop20.org/the-worlds-best-20-education-systems-rankings-third-quarter-report\\n\\n\r\nIt's ok not to mirror real world expectations but when a show is trying to be as close to the real world as possible it needs to uphold a certain degree of believability . If ZnT was trying to present itself as actual fiction then this wouldn't be a problem. But direct commentary and social criticism of one's real world government needs to be handled with better finesse. \"Japan's inferiority complex towards the US\" was treated so lopsidedly that its questionable how it even made it past the rough draft for a final script.\\n\\n\r\nNow the 2nd half of the story is suppose to be the mystery behind 9 & 12's origins and the purpose behind their actions. I don't know about you but a mystery is suppose to keep you guessing and finding clues. But when everything, and I do mean everything, is shown to us in the form of visual exposition within the 1st few episodes then what's the point of continuing to present it as a mystery. Not much of a \"mystery\" at all but the show continues to drag us along to an inevitable conclusion that you've already seen coming. Now the purpose for their actions can be to open the eyes of the Japanese populace or it can be said they wanted to shed light on the government's actions. But when it comes to it all the speculations are simply that, speculations. It's a rather ambiguous ending that shows neither consequences nor the effect of their actions. In other words their actions lacked any substance. Speculations are fine but that's simply inserting answers which the show never said was there. We'd like to think that's what it means but with no solid answer to the madness nothing is given merit. Even up to the very end it needed external knowledge from the viewer for the show to stand on it's own.  That's the epitome of lazy storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nIn short ZnT relied too heavily on presentation but lack actual substance.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe 1st few episodes of ZnT were exceptional but it quickly became a blundering mess. An easy to swallow treat for the visual/audible senses but a brain rot with half-assed characters & story. In other words it's an anime without a soul. As a cinematic experience it gets top marks but for a show that had such high ambitions it fell short. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nIn a day and age where otaku pandering and excessive fan service  is the norm, a show like Zankyou no Terror has stuck out for not following conventions. If you're simply looking for a beautifully crafted show then this is for you. But if you want substance with your presentation then this  might not be up to par.",

            "content": "The concept of terrorism is a rather scary and ambiguous one in today's society. Terrorism comes in all sorts of ways; cyber hacking to bombing buildings to mass murdering people. Zankyou no Terror's terrorism was a bit different though. Zankyou no Terror's hype came not only from the fact that Shinichiro Watanabe directed it, but also because of it's new, intriguing terrorism plot. Although I'm not particularly a fan of so-called \"deep\" anime, I gave Zankyou no Terror a try and due to my lack of psychological thinking, I got rather confused on many parts that seemed to not make sense. Nonetheless, it was anenjoyable anime overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about 2 teenage boys, and one teenage girl. The two boys, Touji Hisami and Arata Kokonone also known as Sphinx #9, and Sphinx #12, are the 2 terrorists. They call themselves, \"Sphinx\" and they send riddle question videos to the government, always giving the government a hint to where they planted a bomb. But for some reason, it seems as though Touji and Arata want the government to find the bomb, they have no desire to actually cause an explosion, but rather just a \"terror\". Meanwhile, the main character girl, Lisa gets tangled up in all of Sphinx's plans and ends up making a decision to join them as an accomplice. On the police's side, there's an ex-detective named Kenjiro Shibazaki who is the only one who can answer Sphinx's riddles, and as the plot progresses he seems to develop an understanding of what and who \"Sphinx\" is. Then... there's a female American government operative, \"Five\" who has some kind of connection to Sphinx's past, and is devoted to catching Sphinx and reuniting herself with Arata Kokonoe. And so the anime's entire plot will become a 3-way psychological cat-mouse game between the japanese police, the American operatives and Sphinx. Questions such as \"Where will they go from there? What is \"Sphinx\"? What are Sphinx's motifs? Who exactly are the \"bad-guys\" in the anime? What is \"right\"? all arise throughout.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot will start off a bit slow, but once it gets going, it is rather interesting. I thought the plot was rather realistic with some unrealism here and there (^o^). The realism comes from the theme: corrupt in society today. But how they achieve that theme was quite unrealistic to me... Somehow a psychopathic psycho like Five became the head of the American Governments Operations in Japan which leaves me dumbfounded; there's no way in reality a psycho like that would become a leader, even with all the corruption. There's even more no way that Sphinx could plant all those bombs without being caught. And EVEN more no way that Lisa, an innocent girl would just join Sphinx and not feel worried/scared at all and not tell anybody about them. If I was Lisa, I'd be scared out of my mind! Despite it's questionable problems, I enjoyed watching the anime every week. The beginning of the anime starts off with a bam, as Touji and Arata were being the terrorists they are, and bombing a place. I honestly think this anime tried a little bit too much to be \"deep\". All the riddles were said to be \"symbolic\" by many \"deep\" thinking viewers, but the riddles were plain riddles derived from Greek Mythology. There really was no life lesson, or deep motif behind them, unless I missed something. The anime was kind of confusing to me. Without spoiling too much, one example of complete confusion was towards the middle of the anime when Sphinx and Five were facing off at an airport. Every move that Five made, and every move that Sphinx made were symbolized by a chess move, which made absolutely no sense. It's like, if Touji went to the bathroom to change into a cops cloth, then that'd be considered \"Bishop B-6\", and if Five sent 5 guards to the bathroom, then that's \"Queen to C-2\", like it made absolutely no sense; there was no correlation. With that said, there were good moments throughout the anime as well, such as the ending which left me happy in it's on way; leaving me in tears. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters was where I had some problems. I liked Sphinx, Arata and Touji; they were the bright spots in the anime. They were developed to the fullest; we learn of their past, their motif, their character, and most importantly their destined goal/fate. If you want to be a terrorist, then follow the footsteps of Arata and Touji, not any other psychopathic monster. Now, the problems started with Lisa, then went on to Five, and when the anime ended I also had some problems with Kenjiro the Japanese Detective's character. As I mentioned before, Lisa shows absolutely no sense of fear when she becomes part of a terrorist group. Some people argue that it's because she has nothing to lose; she gets bullied, she basically has no family since her mother is Coo-Coo and father abandoned her, and she has absolutely nothing in life to look forward to. But, that doesn't take away the fact that Lisa randomly joins Sphinx without hesitation, like really?... But then to add on to that, Lisa's character at first seems like someone you can remorse for, but that's not the case. Quickly Lisa's character develops into a joke. Lisa helps Sphinx do absolutely nothing except make Arata and Touji less lonely. It bothered me how the anime made Lisa seem useless while making the males seem genius and perfect. As for Five, she was just plain annoying and her entire reason for trying to capture Sphinx was pathetic. I won't spoil it, but it really was dumb. And her methods to try and catch Sphinx were cray-cray! It's like she's a government representing villain terrorist, and Arata and Touji are the heroic justice league. Kenjiro's character started with lots of potential, but then the story started to solely focus upon Arata, Touji, Lisa, and Five, leaving Kenjiro's character to rot in the dust until the end of the anime. A waste of a great character at it's finest. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was great. Certainly a different type of art then the usual art. But, it fit in very nicely with the anime's overall mood; it portrayed the realism of terrorism. The darkness/grayness of the art in the anime was nice. I felt like the character's appearances were perfect to their personality. Lisa looks like the typical clumsy girl, Touji looks like the typical open yet mysterious boy, Arata looks like the scar-filled hero, Five looks like the psychopath that she is, and Detective Kenjiro looks like a smart, lazy, mature, and in the end, heroic man himself. As for the music, it wasn't superb, but it was decent. The opening sounded mysterious which was nice, and I liked the animations of the opening too. The opening really portrayed the anime well. There were no other great soundtracks, but none of them were bad, and they did fit in rather nicely with the entire \"terrorism\" concept. The voicing of the characters fit in nicely with each character, especially Lisa, so I praise them for that.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest problem with the anime is honestly not the anime itself, but all the people that call it \"genius\" simply because it's psychological, and about terrorism, hence leading it to be a \"masterpiece\". All the so-called symbolism is something that I personally didn't see in the anime, and if I missed something then feel free to message me explaining all the so-called \"deep-symbolism\". Also, the anime over-exaggerates it's theme of \"corruption\". I do hear about and understand the corruption of the government, but the government itself isn't a terrorist organization, and there are no terrorists in reality that are exactly honorable and heroic. And with that being said, this anime is certainly an anime that I'd recommend to people that enjoy psychological thrillers but also to anyone that wants to watch an anime that will make their brains think. Despite my confusion in some parts of the anime, the parts that I did understand, I enjoyed. The plot was interesting, art was perfect for the anime, sound was good, characters had some problems but were still decent thanks to the 2 mysterious anti-heroic main characters, and all in all it was rather enjoyable. Thanks for reading!",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nZankyou no Terror has easily been one of the most well received anime of the season, and understandably so. It has amazing presentation, unique and memorable music, and it\u2019s directed by motherfucking Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, etc.). After a fantastic first episode filled with intrigue and mystery, the worldwide anime community waited with bated breath to see what this show had in store. So\u2026 While some people were able to continue to enjoy the show from beginning to end, watching the rest of this anime for me was more comparable to staring, frozen at the sight of a terrible accident that killshundreds of people. It\u2019s fucking horrible and gets worse and worse with each passing second\u2026 but you can\u2019t look away. From the worst antagonist in recent memory to poor character development and a plot the goes downhill fast, this anime can only be described as a shame. Looking at what this anime could have been and comparing it to what it ended up being, it\u2019s nothing but a damn shame.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: Two teenagers, who go by the codename \u201cSphinx\u201d, have managed to steal plutonium from a high tech facility. They then go on a spree of terrorism, bombing building after building as the police department scrambles to diffuse the bombs and apprehend the perpetrators. Sphinx\u2019s reasons for doing this are unclear, even to the auidance.\\n\\n\r\nQuite honestly, I think that Zankyou no Terror has perfectly defined the term \u201cdragging it out\u201d. Many people scratched their heads when they realized that the show was only 11 episodes long, but in hindsight, it didn\u2019t even need to be THAT long. The true downfall of the anime is that it\u2019s story and characters are very, very shallow, despite the occasional intrigue they are able to illicit. While the plot starts strong as it presents a relatively believable, realistic setting, the show soon begins a downward spiral into complete, nonsensical absurdity. For instance, the show loses all of its subtlety and starts trying WAY too hard to be an \u201cintelligent\u201d show, thanks to laughable plot points such as \u201cairport chess\u201d (playing a life-size game of chess with an airport as the board -_-). Some of these are so bad that they manage to create plot holes. This spiral is perpetuated by the introduction of a certain character that we\u2019ll get to later. \\n\\n\r\nThe train wreck is culminated in the disaster that was the finale of the show, which was incredibly rushed, anticlimactic, unsatisfying, and really just shockingly bad (that\u2019s right, I could write an entire essay on why that ending sucked, and yet everyone seemed to enjoy it). I think the biggest reason behind this failure is the fact that none of the mysteries have satisfactory answers behind them, or at least not any that are even remotely satisfying. The big revelation of the show is supposed to be the backstory of the characters, particularly their motivations, and quite frankly, it\u2019s all just so damn predictable. The names of the main characters (\u201cNine\u201d and \u201cTwelve\u201d) coupled with the OP are all you need to see to guess to the character\u2019s pasts (or at least the basic gist of it). Once you do that, its just a matter of figuring out their motivations, which are STUPID! It\u2019s not that the motivations themselves are terrible, it\u2019s that they render the entire storyline completely pointless because there are MILLIONS of other, better ways they could have gone about reaching their goals, but stealing plutonium and bombing shit was the idea they decided to go with? Whatever. In short, the plot absolutely crumbles. It\u2019s bad.\\n\\n\r\nIf the plot isn\u2019t where ZnT went wrong, then it was definitely in its characters. Our protagonists, Nine and Twelve, are shallow. We never learn anything substantial about the way they think or who they are. Sure, we learn their backstories, but that doesn\u2019t tell us anything about who they are as individuals. They seemed so promising and unique at first, but they ended up being boring, unspectacular, and not memorable at all. Lisa, the third wheel of the show, has no purpose. Why does she even exist? She is used as a misogynistic plot device in ONE episode, and then does nothing ever again. Even in the finale, when she finally had an opportunity to show that she affected the story or that the story affected her in SOME way, it just doesn\u2019t happen. The ending gets rushed through. So disappointing. Then there\u2019s Five: THE WORST ANIME ANTAGONIST IS RECENT MEMORY. FUCK FIVE. Everything good that the show had going for it gets wrecked or begins its downward spiral once this character showed up. Here\u2019s why: The show used to be morally grey; there were no clear good guys or bad guys because we didn\u2019t know why Sphinx was doing this. Then Five comes along, who is overly maniacal, blatantly evil, and stupidly exaggerated. This wrecks the notion of grey morality and makes it more black and white than a bad shounen would. The show used to have realism; many connections were made to real life, modern places and things that made the show believable. Then Five comes along, begins a game of airport chess (-_-), speaks the WORST engrish I\u2019ve ever heard in my entire life, and successfully manages to manipulate a major government organization at the age of about 17. Makes sense. I could go on, but I think you get the point. This cast of characters is very, very bad, particularly Five. The only character that is even remotely passable is Shibazaki, but he is relatively shallow as well.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Zankyou no Terror has reminded us all about a sad reality: shows that start well do not always end well. In fact, sometimes, they crash and burn. This would be an example of an anime that crashed and burned. I know the first few episodes are really good and really interesting, I know the animation is a fantastic complement to the show, and I know that music is incredible, but none of that can fix the shitstorm of a shallow, incompetent plot and uninteresting characters. Is it a bad anime? No. Is it worth watching? Meh, maybe. It\u2019s just overwhelmingly underwhelming, if that makes sense.",

            "content": "Terror in Resonance focuses on a duo of teen terrorists responsible for a string of bombings throughout Tokyo that have the police baffled over who the culprits are. Mostly focused on our young male leads Nine and Twelve, Terror in Resonance involves the duo using the codename Sphinx to give riddles out to the police in a challenge to have them figure out the location of their bombs before they detonate, leading detective Kenjiro Shibazaki to be involved in the case as only he has the wits and intellect among the police force to connect the dots on the actions and motives involving the bombingswith Sphinx. As the series progresses, a girl around Nine and Twelve's age named Lisa becomes entangled in their plans, more about their dark past is revealed and someone from their past arrives in Japan to attempt sabotaging their efforts.\\n\\n\r\nOn paper, the premise of Terror in Resonance seems like a typical one for a suspense title as elements to its storytelling such as the bombers playing a cat and mouse game with police, the so-called villains not being as evil as you think and government secrets are nothing new within anime. However, the somewhat realistic and dark mood that the series gives off in the exploration of Nine and Twelve's bombings give it something of a chilling feel as the events can hit close to home with American anime viewers of the series, especially in light of the events of the September 11 terrorist attacks.\\n\\n\r\nThe first four episodes are focused around Nine and Twelve's cat and mouse game with the police trying to figure out the whereabouts of their planted bombs via the video riddles that our two leads supply them. The episodes help to establish the characters of the duo and Shibazaki, as we learn of their backgrounds and what issues they are implied to have with their national government. Not to mention the suspense of seeing if either side will prevail in their goal in each episode is genuinely thrilling. Later episodes introduce us to a past acquaintance of Sphinx in the form of Five, accompanied by American agents, who complicates things for Sphinx as she is just as smart and crafty as the duo when she exploits their modus operandi to her advantage by turning the tables on them by playing her own cat and mouse games with the duo for the second third of the series. The final third of the series reveals everything going on with Sphinx, Five and the government secrets connected to them; as well as what plans Sphinx had with the plutonium they had stolen prior to the start of the series that build up to a rather bittersweet, yet satisfying, ending. For the most part, Terror in Resonance is effective at making use of the story elements it is rehashing by applying a more darker and realistic edge them and creating genuine suspense and intrigue out of what you think is going to happen next in the series.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I praise the show of its execution of its plot, it does carry some issues that hurt its quality to an extent involving some among its cast. Lisa's character is mostly worthless in the series as she mostly exists as a damsel-in-distress for Twelve to rescue and has no real relevance to the major events that take place throughout the series, which lead me to question why she exists in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nFive's character is a bit of a double-edged sword for her role in the series. While her presence in the series helps to create a solid adversary against Sphinx, the psychotic and childish fits she gives in to at points in the series do usually make it hard to take her as a serious threat and there are clear lapses in logic from the agents accompanying her as they don't try stopping her destructive and life-threatening actions. Unlike Nine and Twelve, Five doesn't get enough dimension and background to her character to make her sympathetic, especially when later episodes attempt to do so despite the earlier acts she shown where she had no regard for the lives she would put at risk in her cat and mouse game.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation-wise, Terror in Resonance is easily one of the best TV titles this year in what it implements for its visuals and soundtrack. The visuals make use of subdued color tones and plenty of detail for designing its lifelike, vast settings and have character designs that don't have the conventional anime style of rainbow-color hair and big eyes, having bodily features drawn as believably as possible. The animation is easily among the best I've seen for the year for a TV anime thus far, with plenty of onscreen fluid movement that shows people and vehicles moving naturally without degradation of animated detail or noticeable animation shortcuts. Highlights to the animation in the series include groups of people moving about in the streets of Tokyo, the collateral damage resulting from bomb attacks and the impressive looking events that take place in the finale of the series.\\n\\n\r\nFor the show's music, Yoko Kanno lends her music composure talents to the series creating tense and haunting dramatic pieces that are excellent fits to the dark and chilling mood regularly portrayed throughout Terror in Resonance's run. The opening and closing songs to the series (Trigger and Dare Ka, Umi o) are easily the best lyrical tracks for an anime series that I've heard for the year thus far as they are fitting for the mood of the series and immediately stick out to those viewing it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Terror in Resonance makes for a solid 11-episode run of suspense, mystery and intrigue concerning Sphinx's bombings and their origins, making effective use of rehashed story elements through giving them a more darker and realistic edge. It has its shortcomings with some elements to its storytelling and characterization, but it was still a thrilling watch for me to check out throughout its 11-episode run.",

            "content": "What do we think of when we hear the word \u2018terrorism\u2019? The first thought coming to mind would destruction and death. Terrorism isn\u2019t anything new though for the past few decades. A monumental event that took place on September 11, 2001 really stroke the foundation of this word. Taking a step back though, terrorism has always been around whether it involves domestic terrorism, bio-terrorism, or even cyber terrorism. Where does Zankyou no Terror fit into all this? Well, it all begins with an event that the world witnessed which has now become a global pandemonium.\r\nZankyou no Terror (Terror in Tokyo or Terror in Resonance) isa 1-cour show produced by studio MAPPA. The series is an original anime meaning there\u2019s no source material based off of the work. At the same time, it\u2019s noticeable that the show is directed by Shinichiro Watanabe while also reuniting with music producer Yoko Kanno. That alone should evoke some interest for this series. Taking by the standard, the show can be mind indulging. The setting takes place in Tokyo where an event dubbed as terrorism catches the attention of the world. There\u2019s no direct evidence to the true masterminds besides a video uploaded on the Internet. Going by the name of \u201cSphinx\u201d, viewers learn that the culprits are actually two teenage boys with a goal in mind and an ambition that strikes fear.\\n\\n\r\nAs a psychological thriller, the first episode wastes little time to establish the presence of the main characters. We meet Touji Hisami and Arata Kokonone who also seems to play the role of anti-heroes. However, they are better known by their designated numbers \u201c9\u201d and \u201c12\u201d respectively for unknown reasons. The series blasts off literally as they go through the plan to steal plutonium from a power plant. About half a year later, a government building is bombed as the duo creates fear and confusion in Tokyo. There\u2019s one problem though. A young girl named Lisa accidentally gets herself caught in the middle of this affair. Faced with a choice between life or death, she chooses to join them as an accomplice. From here, the show becomes a dangerous cat-and-mouse game or so it seems to be. I have to admit though, this series can quickly become confusing at first. A lot of events happen in the first few episodes where the viewers might not truly understand what\u2019s going on. What exactly is Sphinx? Why are they doing this? What do they want? These common questions pop up instantly as there\u2019s little clues to provide their purpose. However, the show undergoes phases to flesh out these answers with cryptic clues. \\n\\n\r\nAs cryptic as the show seems to be, there are a lot of references, influences, and allusions to cultural and literature. The clues that Sphinx provides to the public often alludes to famous works such as Oedipus Rex. At the same time, there\u2019s also something else noticeable about the two as their plan seemingly involves the engineering of recognition. Sure, they strike fear with what they are doing but their plans results in no death. There has been a few close calls but causalities aren\u2019t a result of what they are seemingly after. That strikes the curiosity of what they really want or if they really are the so-called villains the public makes them out to be. There is a big bad of the show though. We don\u2019t know much about her except her name as \u201cFive\u201d. It\u2019s hard to say how we can feel about the character as she treats the hunt for Nine and Twelfth as a game. Her twisted psyche implies that she came from the same place where Nine and Twelfth did when she was little as seen in various flashbacks. What makes her stand out more is the fact that she solely aims to accomplish a mission while playing with her opponents. It\u2019s also implied that she cares little for the lives of those involved as seen in one particular episode when she gets Lisa caught in a death trap. The relationship Five has with is perhaps most prominent during her conversation with Nine. She treats him as an opponent in her game and hopes to win by putting him in situations where lives really are at stake.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Nine, he also shares some interesting relationships with others. The most prominent is with Twelfth, his friend and accomplice. In a way, we may even see the duo as brothers because of their close bond. But over time throughout the show, there\u2019s a slow yet evident progress that seems to drive them a bit apart. This is seen by their contrasting personalities. Nine is a serious character with stoic expression and man of few words. On the other hand, Twelfth has more of a childish persona who often cracks jokes and make best of what they are doing. The relationship that Twelfth develops with Lisa is also fleshed out throughout the show after he saves her numerous times. In a way, Lisa is similar to Twelfth as both are lonely and tends to cause trouble around them. During one particular scene in the series, she pops a curious question to Twelfth asking him if he is planning to destroy the world. The response suggests that they don\u2019t really care about anything anymore but to do what they want. It\u2019s at this point in the show that viewers may realize the interpersonal relationships characters develop by their common interest. Unlike most series, they are ambiguous and can be interpreted in different ways. For another instance, Nine\u2019s connection with a detective named Kenjiro Shibazaki leads them both into a world of twists. Here, we enter a realm where the hunters may be the hunted but with understanding that comes from jeopardizing others to achieve goals.\\n\\n\r\nThe show can be interpreted in a detective-esque series as well although it lacks the forefront of storytelling by a first person point of view. With the cat-and-mouse game in place, we get several scenarios where detective Shibazaki comes close to catching Sphinx in particular Nine. At one interesting point, the two even work together because of a common goal. However, the way the suspense is delivered can be a mixed bag. The clues sometimes feels a bit simplistic, predictable (through foreshadowing), and sometimes even repetitive. Furthermore, we don\u2019t know much about the characters\u2019 backgrounds. We can only scratch on the surface to see what type of person they have become. Compared to their past, it\u2019s really hard to characterize them on an individual scale. However, there\u2019s decent suspense when it comes to conspiracy regarding VON (as shown in the beginning of the show). The mechanics behind the conspiracy is explained without confusing the audience and offers thorough guidance. As such, the show is aware of what it has been doing to transit each episode with its structure and delivering a well-crafted story. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s too intelligent as some bits are ambiguous such as Lisa/Twelfth\u2019s relationship. It\u2019s hard to say the significance of their relationship but ultimately is on track of the show\u2019s execution. \\n\\n\r\nAs a character coming into this new world, Lisa can also be quite a character for debate. We know that she isn\u2019t a popular girl, terrible at cooking, and in general a clumsy character who is often not sure of her place in this world. Her family background is most left in the dark but through several scenes, it\u2019s easy to see that it isn\u2019t exactly bright. The only character she is closed to is Twelfth. It\u2019s hard to say they are friends but rather as close acquaintances. Later on, it\u2019s easy to realize how much Twelfth dedicates himself to Lisa; a sharp contrast to when he threatened her life after becoming an acquaintance in the beginning. It\u2019s also implied that there\u2019s more to meet than the eye from where she came to the world as a child which sparks interest. However, her character can be somewhat controversial. Throughout the show, she also plays a bit of the \u2018damsel in distress\u2019 especially after the introduction of Five. I wouldn\u2019t call her a terrible character but some of her roles are underwhelming. Perhaps the show is trying to send a message of what someone\u2019s life feels like when they enter a completely different world. In this case, Lisa would be the normal character entering the Nine and Twelfth\u2019s abnormal world. She\u2019s not entirely useless either considering some of her actions did influence certain outcomes. However, she isn\u2019t the sharpest tool in a shed either.\\n\\n\r\nEven prior to the first episode, preview videos show that the anime has great potential on technical fronts. When it comes to visuals, this series deserves praise as it illustrates the realism of terrorism. Destruction such as a government building and aircraft highlights fear and tension. The spectacular artwork depicts the consequences of that with great precession. The characters\u2019 designs also have a feeling that makes you think they are outsiders. Nine and Twelfth and designed with simple characteristics to make them look normal. Five on the other hand has the look of a mischievous woman; a trait that fits her role accurately considering her hacking skills. Finally, there\u2019s Lisa and Shibazaki who are designed to look very human. In retrospect, MAPPA studio aced their production qualities with a bang. And even saying that figuratively, the short yet memorable moments of those explosions captures the world\u2019s attention.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack also plays a prominent role thanks to the talented Yoko Kanno. Her music score delivers the message of a solemn tune with deadly accuracy when it comes to depict a theme of isolation. The slow pacing of the soundtrack has a meaningful purpose with it\u2019s trying to portray. In particular, several scenes creates a brooding atmosphere that matches perfectly with the OST. The jazz tunes also commands attention to achieve its desired effect especially during climatic scenes. Finally, both the OP and ED songs creates the thriller-like vibe to give what the audience expects \u2013 a convincing tale of mind games.\\n\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror\u2019s premise and delivery ultimately prevails in the end despite some of its predictable plot points and pacing. What began as a terrorist plot transpires into mind games and relationship building that develops naturally. The show seizes opportunities to make the best of what it has and although it doesn\u2019t always deliver masterfully, it\u2019s well intentioned for its efforts. Characters have diverse range of personalities and motivations to create tension. If you\u2019re looking for an anime with impressive visuals and soundtrack as well, then you\u2019ll be in for a nice treat. In the end, Shinichiro\u2019s talents are realized once again in this show. For a thriller, this show definitely requires attention and patience. And in the end, it\u2019s worth every minute. \\n",

            "content": "Terror in Resonance is a fine anime in terms of directing and tension. It\u2019s not hard to see how it excited thousands of viewers into calling it anime of the year back when the first episode aired. That still doesn't make up for its undeniably amateurishly handled script when it comes to mystery stories. Personally, I didn't need to wait for the show to be over before I knew it wasn\u2019t as good as they were hyping it to be. The cracks were obvious since the very pilot and kept getting bigger with each new episode. The reason why everybody else didn\u2019t want to admitto that is because the director was Watanabe of Cowboy Bebop fame. There is no way for Watanabe to mess up, even if anything else he made besides Bebop was average. Well, damn, he did, what a shock. So for those of you who are in constant denial while hugging your huge anime pillows.\\n\r\nAllow me to give you some basic pointers, for as to why this anime was basically a waste of my time and why I regret watching it so much. \\n\r\n-The plot is basically, plot less:\\n\r\nIt starts out with a very intriguing idea about how two teenagers plan to create chaos in Japan by exploding a Government building, and then send out riddles for the police to solve in order to stop the bombs that they plant. Each time, the riddle is engrossed with a message. \\n\r\nHowever,\\n\r\nI could already predict what the rest of the show will be about after episode 3. I mean, really, it was obvious what the terrorists wanted to do thereafter. A good mystery story is revealing itself slowly, constantly keeping you interested to find out more. This anime didn\u2019t do that. It overused its already lazy exposition gimmicks to the point it revealed all the major plot points in its first quarter. All there was left was an almost fatalistic procedure because it became that predictable. And the only reason it took 11 episodes to play out exactly as I predicted was only because they wasted half the show running after Lisa or Five, characters whose role was to derail the plot and waste time.\\n\r\n-Everyone seems to act like a retard except that one cop.\\n\r\n-There doesn't seem to be real *terror* in the show.\\n\r\nTerrorism and human experiments, Ooooh! what a thrill!\\n\r\nI expect people crouching, crying and going insane. Thinking how it's going to be the end of the world, as the atomic bomb is going to explode.\\n\r\nLol, no.\\n\r\n-It seems like a very, very bad anime remake of V for vendetta but without the good dialogues, plot and characterization.\\n\r\n-The only reason I watched the whole show was because of the fantastic sound and animation, and that's it.\\n\r\n-Why is five even there? \\n\r\nThe story is disrupted when this psychotic bitch, five enters the scene. Where she doesn't capture nine and twelve, but chooses to play a game with them. Which btw is completely fine because the Americans are Muppets being controlled by her and choose to ignore every thing until one them points a gun at her and says that enough is enough. At which point, five kills him and then finally come face to face with nine. You would think that she wanted to say or do something interesting when she finally meets the man she has been chasing this whole time? RIGHT? RIGHT?\\n\r\nNooooooo, she just tells him that it was all a game and kills herself.\\n\r\nWait, what.\\n\r\nYes, EXACTLY.\\n\r\n- Does anybody even know about the experiments in the end? were the guilty parties even punished? We don't know. All we know that a bunch of buildings were bombed and two teenagers were killed. And most of the anime was spent rescuing a stupid bimbo called Lisa.\\n\r\n-This is not how real detectives do stuff they know how to do basic research and are not complete idiots who don't even know how to use wikipedia, furthermore when you look at a nuclear explosion, you don't hold hands and pretend as if they are fire works. Because there is a thing called radio-activity. And EMP pulses are enough to kill anyone who has a pacer in his heart or is in life support in hospitals, thus contradicting the attempt to not kill anyone.\\n\r\n- There is no political statement behind the bombings because the two terrorists do not reveal them until the show is over. They don\u2019t even have demands for not going forward with the bombings; a thing which no terrorist ever does. If there is a statement, there is no reason not to reveal it right away; something which of course they didn't because that way the show would end in 2 episodes.\\n\r\n- Where is the so called awakening of the population that I was promised in the synopsis of the show? Because all I remember is yawing through out the show and waiting for it to show the greatness it promised.\\n\r\n-Over all points:\\n\r\nStory:3/10\\n\r\nArt:9/10\\n\r\nSound:9/10\\n\r\nCharacter:3/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment:4/10\\n",

            "content": "Zankyou no Terror pricked up the ears of many anime fans when it was announced to be an original anime directed by Shinichiro Watanabe. Since Watanabe had previously directed widely acclaimed shows such as Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, and Kids on the Slope, Zankyou no Terror was naturally expected to be Watanabe\u2019s next big work. Couple that with the fact that Yoko Kanno, another big name in the anime industry, handled the soundtrack composition, and the show instantly became a fan favorite coming into the season. So then the question has to be asked: \u201cDoes Zankyou no Terror live up to its hype?\u201d \r\nMy answerwould have to be, \u201cnot really.\u201d In short, Zankyou no Terror is worthy of its praise for its impressive visuals and a phenomenal soundtrack, but those alone are not enough to cover up the lack of character development and the slightly problematic story.\\n\\n\r\nStory & Exposition\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror is about two mysterious teenagers, Nine and Twelve, who plan a series of terrorist bombings in Tokyo under the alias of \u201cSphinx.\u201d Much like the Sphinx from Greek Mythology, Nine and Twelve give out a riddle to the public before detonating each bomb. An ex-detective named Kenjiro Shibazaki is the only one in the Japanese police force that figures out the answers to the riddles, and he vows to bring \u201cSphinx\u201d to justice. Shibazaki, however, eventually realizes that Nine and Twelve have ulterior motives behind their terrorist bombings and figures out a disturbing truth. But before Shibazaki can process the truth, the Sphinx bombings come to a sudden stop as the FBI, led by an old friend of Nine and Twelve, intervenes and starts a wild cat-and-mouse chase to capture \u201cSphinx.\u201d A three-way battle between the Japanese police force, \u201cSphinx,\u201d and the FBI unfolds as they all try to carry out their own purposes. \\n\\n\r\nSince you are sort of thrown into the middle of this whole situation, watching Zankyou no Terror initially feels like playing a videogame without in-game tutorials: You have to learn everything there is to know about the anime as it goes on. The show will leave you plenty of hints throughout the series through flashbacks, cinematographic details, and dialogue, but in the end it is up to you to analyze those hints and figure out what is going on. Since most anime rely on \u201cinfo dumps\u201d to spoon-feed background information to the audience, Zankyou no Terror really stood out in the beginning for its engaging style of exposition. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with this style of exposition, however, is that there is a limit as to how much the show can tell the viewers without directly telling them. The more information the show holds from the audience, the harder it will be to explain everything towards the end. Unfortunately, this was the case for Zankyou no Terror, so even if the show tried to explain everything towards the end, it answered only the bare essentials of the questions raised by the show. Zankyou no Terror should have struck a balance between what they should tell the audience and what they should hold from the audience, but they decided to hold too much from the audience and paid the price of glossing over several questions that needed to be addressed. Although the show wraps up its story relatively well, there was a sense of incompleteness that left me dissatisfied in the end.\\n\\n\r\nStyle Over Substance?\\n\r\nWhen it comes to Watanabe, it\u2019s hard not to talk about his style. Without a doubt, Zankyou no Terror is Watanabe\u2019s directing at its finest, especially in terms of cinematography: Watanabe uses a lot of low-key lighting in order to convey a sense of despair and isolation, or in other cases a sense of mystery and suspense; he uses different camera panning techniques to give scenes 3D depth that makes them look dynamic; and of course, his love for the visual spectacle resulted in some of the most beautifully animated scenes to be seen in anime history. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Zankyou no Terror is the typical case of a show that emphasizes \"style over substance,\" in which the captivating style overwhelms the comparatively weak substance. There definitely was a deeper message and a darker story behind Zankyou no Terror, but the show just didn't do a good job of conveying that message and story. Most of the story\u2019s shortcomings and shallowness can be blamed on the length of the show, because a 1-cour was not enough to tell the story that Zankyou no Terror was trying to tell. The writers could definitely have planned it better, but what started out as a seemingly profound show about exploring the mindset of terrorists and discussing the corruption and degradation of a Japanese nation quickly became a blockbuster action thriller filled with clich\u00e9s and empty characters. The writers tried too hard to combine a dark social commentary with action thriller sequences that the show ended up as a confused mishmash that lost the original focus of the story. Zankyou no Terror should have focused more on being either a dark human drama or a pulse-pounding suspense drama, but not both.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters & Developments\\n\r\nWith the story trying to be two things at once and Watanabe focusing too much on his own style, the weakest aspect of Zankyou no Terror would undoubtedly be its characters. There just is not much to say about the characters because viewers never get an in-depth look into each character. At one point, viewers have to accept the fact that some characters are just plot devices in order for the story to meet a certain end. The characters definitely had the potential to drive the story in a better direction, but the characters are instead sacrificed in order for the story to finish strong. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, it is not like the characters get no development at all. The show actually makes subtle attempts to try and develop its characters, and so if the viewers are willing to invest themselves enough to the show, they will indeed be able to find redeeming qualities within the characters. However, for most viewers the characters do not get developed enough for them to care. And without the emotional connection between the viewers and the characters, viewers cannot look beyond the dull and stereotypical personas to find the characters likable or relatable. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a real shame considering that the characters were actually interesting. Looking at it strictly from the characters\u2019 perspectives, the story revolves around five social outcasts who each want to make something of their aimless lives and do something right for themselves. Seeing each of them struggle in his or her own way to carry out individual goals is actually both heartbreaking and heartwarming to watch. However, the show, again, never capitalizes on the emotional development of these characters, and thus the inner conflicts of the protagonists become largely overlooked. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Realism\\n\r\nA rather unique aspect about this show is its sense of realism. Since the setting is in an alternative version of modern Japan, it is difficult for viewers to suspend their disbelief because the show makes everything seem so realistic and believable. For example, it is clear that the writers did their research in terms of how bombs are made, how hackers invade the system, and how the police would react to terrorist attacks. Not only that, the show throws in all these real life references, like YouTube videos, Puzzles & Dragons, Twitter tweets, and Bitcoins to further emphasize the show\u2019s realism.\\n\\n\r\nThe realism can be seen in the character designs as well. For example, the show contains a lot of close-ups on the characters\u2019 faces, so the facial features are detailed and well proportioned. The characters as a whole are given normal human appearances, but are still distinct from one another because of their facial and bodily features. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the animation, the show stomps its competition by a long shot. Although there was a quality drop towards the end of the show, the animation overall was smooth, detailed, and beautifully done. Briefly mentioned above, Watanabe\u2019s choices in cinematography is really what made the animation stand out even more and resulted in visually stunning scenes that are hard to come by in anime.\\n\\n\r\nKanno & Soundtrack\\n\r\nUsually, the soundtrack is my least favorite part to review because there are only so many ways of saying that the soundtrack \u201cenhances the mood or atmosphere of certain scenes in the anime.\u201d I mean, which soundtrack doesn\u2019t? Zankyou no Terror\u2019s soundtrack, however, gives me something to write about. For one thing, the soundtrack is categorically indie, filled with several experimental songs that combine electronic, classical, and ambient sounds together with (or without) vocals in Japanese, English, or Icelandic. Yoko Kanno shows off her musical prowess once more and proves that she is not afraid to experiment with different styles of music in order to make a soundtrack appropriate for Zankyou no Terror. The soundtrack, therefore, is terrific. What makes it more than just an excellent soundtrack, however, is that it becomes better when complemented by the anime. Partly due to the cinematic quality of Zankyou no Terror, every scene in which a song is playing in the background looks and feels like a music video. In other words, the emotions evoked from the scenes mesh beautifully with the melody of the songs, thus making Zankyou no Terror\u2019s soundtrack an essential part in enjoying this anime to its fullest.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict\\n\r\nWatch Zankyou no Terror at your own risk. The realistic art and the remarkable music are enough to blow you away, but the problematic story and dull characters will reasonably disappoint you. Watch this show as you would any other show by lowering your expectations, and only then will you find that Zankyou no Terror is one of the better ones, especially among original anime, to come out in awhile.\\n\\n\r\n*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nMusic: 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n(Edit: I decided to weigh the \"story and character\" more (60%) and \"art, music, and enjoyment\" less (40%).

            "content": "And thus, what is easily one of the most politically charged anime in recent memory has come to a close. People are primarily attracted to it for its value as a piece of visual entertainment, but is that all there is to works such as this? \r\nThus in my determination to explicate on the matter as thoroughly as possible, I would like to present to you with my POFITs on the anime Zankyou no Terror, or as it is in English, 'Terror in Resonance'.\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nTo begin with, allow me to present my case for what is most definitely the primary objective behind this particular anime's conception.\r\nForone, this anime, though it utilizes plot elements from a multitude of genres in fiction such as the thriller, psychological and police procedural genres, it is in reality much more akin in spirit to that of satires (albeit a very dry and analytical one utilizing extensive irony, analogy and juxtaposition), social commentaries and political fiction.\\n\\n\r\nThe heavy usage of highly subtle and somewhat in-your-face symbolism that are intimately connected to events that had occurred outside of fiction, in addition to explicit references to key events in real world history is indicative of the overall direction that this anime is taking, and on what themes, ideas and messages that it attempts to convey to the general public.\\n\\n\r\nAnd because of that, whoever was in charge of conceiving such ideas and putting them onto the screen is personally expounding his or her views within the permissible scope of free speech. Which in this case, revolves around the increasingly dangerous and alarming resurgence of Japanese ultra-nationalism, as well as the current ongoing debate regarding the proposed amendments to Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution. Other subtle critiques against the current state of Japanese societal affairs include, but are not limited to the increasing political apathy among the Japanese, as well as the increasingly alarming state of interpersonal relationships within the Japanese population.\\n\\n\r\nNow, were those symbols and references used to maximum effect? Yes and no, as their placement and timing is at times too subtle or multi-layered that it tends to make the audience lose track of or interest in them amid the very fast, though expertly paced plot sequences; no scene drags, and no scene ever feels too fast. \\n\\n\r\nAs to the actual plot itself, it is relatively straightforward and very dense though halfway on, the plot takes on a rather chaotic turn as new plot elements and characters are introduced, though only momentarily before returning to a somewhat more stable state of affairs before the climax. The 'lull' so to speak. But is all of this 'completely original'? Not really, and at times not exactly necessary either. Especially in regards to the themes, a far more elaborate and metaphorical take on the plot would greatly lessen the impact of the message itself.\\n\\n\r\n{EDIT}\\n\\n\r\nA note on the script-writing pertaining to the story as a whole, I have made re-assessments in regards to certain plot points and thematic concepts, and I have concluded that they were unsatisfactorily handled, i.e., that they were either stretching the limits of believability or simply not explored thoroughly enough, in that ideas were merely referenced rather than expounded upon via a variety of means to properly convey the sheer gravity and scale of the series' themes. \\n\\n\r\nIndeed, perhaps one of the key expectations that numerous people have when they think of the show, is that it possesses a certain 'je ne sais quoi', a certain 'revolutionary seriousness' or 'zeitgeist quality' to it which demands that it be taken very seriously, whereby the very fact that it possesses this very element signifies a 'do or die' expectation from the audience. Thus, notwithstanding the slightest inconsistency in logic, or it not being bold, challenging or transgressive enough, the show's very nature, now weighed down by the 'just not quite there yet' execution in its thoroughness, is probably the biggest reason why despairing disappointment, is all too prevalent.\\n\\n\r\nStory Rating: 7\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nWhen I speak of the artistic qualities of the anime, I would like to say that this is easily one of the best animated animes in recent years. There are few still shots, and whatever still shots there are are expertly crafted to represent as close as possible to the essence of what it means to be in Japan during summer. One particular still shot that stood out, especially to me as I've experienced being in Japan before, is the still shot that depicts a school hallway in the summer daytime. Absolutely stunning and near realistic, reminds me very much of my own experience.\\n\\n\r\nNo scene feels lifeless, and no scene is in lacking of much needed detail. The extensive use of cinematographic elements in this anime adds value to certain scenes by heightening their suggested emotional or physical impact. The 3D animation used in this anime in relation to certain objects as well as background extras are impeccable, and blend extremely well with the 2D drawings. Particle effects, lighting effects, the fluid movements of objects and people, the extreme attention to all these elements can be summarized in one word: meticulous. The same goes for the symbolism and references as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt Rating: 10\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound-based elements in the anime, the characters are well-voiced, lending credibility to the emotions displayed on screen. Miscellaneous sound effects such as gun shots, explosions, object movement, footsteps and the like are very well done and do not sound in any way cut and paste. \\n\\n\r\nThere has been debate in regards to the depiction of the English language used in some scenes, and overall, I would like to say that it is rather adequate though still underwhelming. One secondary character and one side character in particular are noted for their bad English pronunciation as well as their surprisingly good English pronunciation respectively in accordance to their characterization.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the background music and soundtrack, they are excellent. The soundtrack has enough variety and flair to facilitate the overall mood and tone of their respective scenes. If I can remember correctly, there are set piano pieces to set a tone of calm, set guitar riffs to heighten tension as well as a myriad of songs used throughout to provide symbolic meaning, which are mostly in English or even Icelandic. \\n\\n\r\nA little trivia is that all pieces used in the soundtrack are natively composed in Iceland to provide a degree of authenticity to some of the sounds, and that the anime itself also makes references to Icelandic music when pertaining to one main character's musical tastes.\\n\\n\r\nSound Rating: 8\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nAlright, characters..... Unfortunately, I would have to make certain comments in regards to the characterization of characters in this anime. For the most part, the characters are simple, rather 'tropey' characters. In fact, at certain points throughout the anime, one would see that the characterization of the main characters, as well as some secondary characters are a bit lacking and leaves one questioning as to whether they have much or any purpose within the overall plot, and one would also question as to whether the utilization of such characters or their assigned characteristics is even effective in advancing the plot or in helping to ease the conceptualization of the themes.\\n\\n\r\nThat said however, despite the characters embodying very specific 'Jungian archetypes' so to speak, they still do receive further development in their overall personalities, it's just that due to the very short runtime of the series, their identities are simply not developed to their fullest potential.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Rating: 6\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nStrictly speaking, the visual entertainment medium, in fact, all entertainment are primarily created for profit-seeking enterprises as well as entertainment and artistic merit and prestige. Sometimes however, works such as this emerge that immediately warrants not an evaluation of whether one was able to derive 'pleasure' from it, but whether one was able to appreciate and ponder on its messages, themes and whether its artistic elements helped one come closer to a better understanding of them, or of life itself. At times, the best fiction, and even the best works of art and music aren't for enjoyment's sake but are attempts at better conceptualizing and clarifying what is known as 'worldly truth' depending on their scope of exploration.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for that, this show does it relatively rather well.\\n\\n\r\nAppreciation Rating: 8 \\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would like to conclude my review on the anime Zankyou no Terror by offering both a 'Recommended Viewing' and 'Socially Important' approval seals to it despite areas of unsatisfactory development, in addition to providing total aggregate scores of:\\n\\n\r\n[9 For Personal Rating]\\n\\n\r\nAnd\\n\\n\r\n[8 For Critical Rating]\\n\\n\r\nI bid all of you farewell, till next time then.\\n\\n\r\n{NISHIZAWA APPROVED}\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\n(P.S. If you happen to want some music recommendations since this anime makes active use of music composed in Iceland, then I would like to point you to the Icelandic artists Bjork and Sigur Ros. And yeah, Sigur Ros's first album is titled Von as well)",

Lately, the beginning of the 21st Century has cropped up numerous terrorist acts across the globe. So, what better way of showcasing these horrific acts of violence then to make an anime where the terrorists are the protagonists? With Cowboy Bebop director Shinchiro Watanabe at the helm of production in Terror in Resonance, this was sure to be a fiery sensation like many of his previous works. Yet, in spite of the hype, it turns out to be aprime example of how not every show with a talented director will be a marvelous project.\\n\\n\r\nSaying this is an abject failure, however, would be stretching it too far. It can be construed as a pretty good thriller in comparison to most recent anime thrillers that have come out. What Watanabe clearly knows what to do in his direction is to create a tone that is impending to the viewer. Whether it's comical like in his earlier works, or serious like in Kids on the Slope and Terror in Resonance. With the latter, we feel an intense, unsettling atmosphere directed by the three protagonists that we're following. Cold and calculated, they know how to create chaos in a just society and we can feel that anguish and thought process quite clearly and with great direction.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is one that speaks with radiance and greatness, accomplished once again by the always talented Yoko Kanno. Blending various styles of electronic music composition and dark string instruments, Kanno helps add so much layered atmosphere to the show. This and Watanabe's dark direction create a nice mixer that feels very cohesive to the structure of the environments we see in many scenes throughout Terror in Resonance.\\n\\n\r\nNot often do you see artwork on character designs to look more human than in typical anime. Terror in Resonance's artwork consists of beautifully drawn backgrounds with a nice coat of colors that give a dreary focal point to the setting. Washed out colors that have dark blue overtones are paved, even in scenes where there is daylight. Sometimes, in a small nit pick I'll admit, the darkness can be a little bit too much, to the point where it is difficult to see. Especially in the scenes where we visit the apartment rooms and there is hardly any light and I can barely see the characters in front of the camera's view.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Terror in Resonance marvels in is technicality. Other than those aspects, Terror in Resonance is lackluster in the aspects of story and character development. For starters, the vast majority of the characters in the show feel very vapid in terms of their characterization and personality. The only exception is Lisa Mishma because of her internal struggles that feel very genuine and relatable in her anxieties and psychological issues. Outside of her character, the two people she brought herself into, named Nine and Twelve, aren't as strong as her. Nine especially is inexcusably dull from what his goals are to begin with, which I'll get to later on, and his overall arc. Twelve is at least a little bit more enthralling because of his charming charisma, but considering how the show wants to be a dark psychological thriller, it feels a little out of place in some areas.\\n\\n\r\nBesides our three main leads, other characters come off as just decent, but nothing more memorable than that. Though I will say, Five is definitely a contender for villain of 2014 because of how they successfully make her into a big considerable threat. The police terrorism division head, Kenjirou Shibazaki, is a nice throwback to old-school crime detectives who are the main driving force in stopping the opposition. Although they aren't the very least bit memorable from the lack of any special identity, other than the fact that they are just there to stop the protagonists' bombings.\\n\\n\r\nNow we get to the story portion of the critique. This can easily be summed in a few main crutches that make it good: Lack of a coherent structure and poor development. All of this can pointed to the backstory of Nine, Twelve, and Five, which feels absolutely uninspired. Yes, it's your typical \"kids escape from a facility of a brainwashed government facility and go their separate ways\" plot. That isn't to say that it can't ever be done well, but with Terror in Resonance, it was lacking a special pull for me to even be interested in this type of plot again. Uninspired is the perfect word to describe the plot, with Watanabe on board on a project like this, you'd expect something more ambitious than this.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, was this a great thrill ride despite all that is said about the plot issues? Absolutely. The tension I get whenever the police are trying to find the bombs that Nine and Twelve put out in the city are some of the most intense sequences I've experienced yet. Again, with Watanabe's great direction, the atmosphere definitely helps make this work tremendously. With that and Kanno's extravagant music makes for a perfect amalgamation with all these elements neatly wrapped into a triumph for a suspenseful thriller.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some aspects that disappointed me to some regard, considering this is Watanabe's first directed show in nearly five years. That aside, I can still see this as worthwhile to watch. This will most likely be his least popular work, considering how Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo are typically looked at by everyone. But trying to best out his other works would be an impossible feat to take over; probably even for Watanabe himself.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B-",

            "content": "\"Zankyou no Terror\" is a terrifying thriller that will resonate with your soul.\r\nI don't know what expectations I had for this anime, but it sure exceeded any thoughts about it swirling around in my mind.\r\n\"Zankyou no Terror\" is a story about two odd teenage boys, Nine and Twelve.  As terrorists, they go by the name of \"Sphinx,\" uploading videos to tell where the next attack will be. The police are powerless to stop these children -- who shouldn't even exist -- from pulling the trigger on this world.\r\nThe three main voice actors of this series open the audience to a whole new world ofdesperation, solitude, and hope. Ishikawa, Kaito plays the brilliant, but shut off Nine, a genius hacker and brilliant mastermind (also played Harutora [Tokyo Ravens]). Ishikawa takes Nine's sadistic, yet kind and insecure personality and molds a new voice for this character. The voice is deep and silky like velvet, but hides a certain weakness under the dark tones. Likewise, Saito, Soma takes Twelve's character and does his own this with it, bringing the street smart, energetic boy to life (also played Tatsumi [Akame ga Kill!]). It reminds one of a dark and twisted Nagisa (Free!!), but holds more depth than that. The boys' accomplice, Mishima, Lisa, was voiced by Tanezaki, Atsumi who did a wonderful portrayal of a young, lonely girl with deep insecurities (also played Natsume, Asako [Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun]). She has a sweet, timid voice that makes this otherwise unappealing girl quite charming.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was definitely my favorite this season. I'm constantly on the lookout for a good psychological thriller. I was not left down. It all started with the opening song that just screamed 'love me!' And as ordered, I fell in love. Not only did it seem to have a good base for a great storyline, but it was intriguing from just the art alone. This is the first time I had ever seen such detailed, and realistic animation -- the first time characters actually looked Japanese. And it just gets better. The music was truly the best of this season. There is a segment in the anime where Nine has a nightmare, and I say others should take notes, because that is how a nightmare should look and sound.  It was a chaotic dream sequence with vague images telling a background story, accompanied by eerie music that further accentuated the dream-like state(lolol - OST).  Dreams are chaotic, and most have no one speaking -- there may be mouthing, but no words come out. However, even though you cannot hear the words, you know what the other person is saying. And that is how a nightmare should go. Another part I felt was executed correctly was the pacing. I don't think any pacing was a bit off in this anime the transitions were smooth, Twelve's and Nine's motives were slowly unveiled, and there were no characters introduced last minute. There was only one thing that bothered me: a character named Five. She was severely detrimental to the boys' plans. And maybe this is me hating on the character, but I felt that her existence affected the anime greatly, in a slightly negative way. But it happened, and now that it's over, I am not complaining. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a constant message being played throughout \"Zankyou no Terror\"; Von. It is of Icelandic origin, and most of the OSTs are sung in this language, making them sound like a piece of Bj\u00f6rk's. The constant message of 'Von' means 'Hope.' Twelve and Nine are trying to remind themselves --and others -- of hope. I feel that all the subliminal messages in this anime are very deep; enough to make one cry.\\n\\n\r\nNow this anime, like all psychological thrillers, is for the discerning of mind. There are a lot of mental games, and if you enjoy figuring those out and playing along, you will enjoy this anime. For those who like animes with a deeper meaning, this one is also for you. However, if you are the type to like fluffy shoujo stories, I suggest you give this a chance, but you might not like it. All I can say is that this is the first time I've ever truly been satisfied with an anime that only ran for eleven episodes. It was a short ride, but a memorable one.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\r\nFrom the beginning, the base plot was perfectly mapped out with a pretty accurate summary of what the show might be like. As the story continued more characters were introduced -- all with the purpose of helping the storyline. Even having been annoyed by one (Five), she was not detrimental to the plot in the long run.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nWhile it may look rather plain, the artwork is really THE best ALL season. The characters actually look Japanese, not to mention very realistic. So much detail went into the characters from their waving hair to the subtle qualities in their eyes, to each expression and mannerism. \\n\\n\r\nMusic - 10\\n\r\nLike the art, the music had to be the best of the season. I don't give many tens for music, but this anime deserved it. First it was the opening that gripped me by the shoulders, invoking the emotions of suspense, yearning, and fear. All the OSTs were beautiful were a melodic tune that captured the thrilling and mysterious essence of the show. And to close it off was the ending; a surreal piece that excited me, but was very bloodthirsty, if not a bit desperate.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nThe character establishment was perfect. Twelve and Nine are introduced in the most uncanny way, as well as Lisa. Lisa's past and disappointing present are given in the first episode, and clarified upon throughout the series. Then the show moves onto the boys' pasts, taking a slight detour for detective Shibazaki who is working on the 'Sphinx' case. Then Five appears, making me question the show for a bit, but my worries were resolved in a wonderful, if not in a heartbreaking fashion. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\n\"Zankyou no Terror\" started with no place on my 'hype list,' and ended with the top slot. I love this show a lot, and am probably not going to find another like it for a long time. But that's fine. It is finding these gems that make watching anime so worth my while. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9.6\\n\r\nOverall, I very much enjoyed this anime with only one moment of doubt (a first for me!). It has all the elements I need in a perfect story; fitting music, subliminal messages, well rounded characters, great art, and an intriguing storyline. I am confident enough to say that this anime deserves only scores above eight, and it is well worth the watch.",

            "content": "Yet another over-hyped anime that started off the season and just like Attack on Titan, it became a train-wreck as well. Let me make this perfectly clear from the very beginning: this show is all style and no substance. Whatever deep sociopolitical message is ingrained here is hardly ever explored; the show would rather focus on fancy explosions and cool-sounding themes that don't even matter in the end. With that out of the way, I'll start the review.\r\nStory (25%) - 3/10\r\nMy reason for giving it such a low score is the fact that the riddles feel so pointless. And this is a big deal sinceabout 8 of the episodes focus on them. I keep asking myself: what was the point of those riddles?; why didn't they use the bomb from episode 1?; why didn't they reveal their motive for the bombings from the very beginning?; why didn't anyone go blind after staring at a nuclear explosion? So many questions.... And of course, all the fanboys are over-thinking the show to death with all their BS about how the show is such a deep social commentary on Japan, despite the fact that the show barely spared an episode to mention all that, instead focusing on pointless explosions and riddles. I can do it too, you know:\\n\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror is actually a show about how Japan refuses to learn from its past mistakes, just like how ZnT refuses to learn from the mistakes of Death Note and Code Geass. How? By adding another one-dimensional, white-haired antagonist to ruin the show and MORE BULLS*** CHESS.\\n\\n\r\nArt (20%) - 8/10\\n\r\nDefinitely some of the most realistic looking backgrounds and effects I've seen in anime. The directing is superb, better than most action flicks, and the explosions aren't cartoony. The animation is spectacular and it felt almost like a live-action movie at times. The character designs are what prevent a 10. As I was watching the show, the two main leads kinda reminded me of the characters in Free! The designs just don't seem very original and they don't stand out from other anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound (20%) - 8/10\\n\r\nNot as good as Bebop's soundtrack but still excellent. The OP however, didn't leave much of an impact. Not much else to say, definitely some of Yoko Kanno's best work.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (25%) - 3/10\\n\r\nNone of the characters in the show are relatable, making it hard to identify with any of them. Nine and Twelve really aren't interesting as characters; after their backstories were revealed, I felt sorry for them but also found them rather dull. Lisa was even more useless than Sakura from Naruto (if that's possible) and Five wasn't interesting in the least bit. Shibazaki was interesting and he was certainly the most humane character but he doesn't get much screen time or development and he is reduced to nothing but a plot device in the end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10%) - 7/10\\n\r\nIt may be a bad show but it has great art and sound. If you're only in it for the explosions and to be given infodumps by random people about the oh so interesting plot instead of being given something to think about, then you'll enjoy this. But don't expect a good thriller anime, this show is pretentious and has no message to offer that it doesn't outright tell you.",

            "content": "\"I started watching this really good anime; it's about terrorists.\" my cousin told me the one day. I was a bit startled by her statement and didn't expect that I'd like 'Zankyou no Terror' this much! *updated*\r\nSTORY (8/10): Knowing that this anime would be about terrorists, I was quite skeptical about what the plot would be like. I figured it would mainly be based on crazy action scenes and undeveloped characters but, boy, was I wrong! It turned out being completely different than I expected, and in a good way. The anime always had me guessing. Rather than pouring all of this overwhelming information ontoyou, it reveals things little by little, making the audience think about it and come up with theories about the characters' goals. I was not bored at all and was immediately pulled in from the moment I started watching! \\n\\n\\n\r\nART (8/10): 'Terror in Resonance' has some astounding art that really caught my eye and was a big factor in keeping my attention. It had a very clean-cut, yet elegant style. I love, love, LOVE the dramatic colors, lighting, and effects that were used, as well. It really helped set the mood for each scene and the show as a whole. From the delicately outlined animation, to the vivid city streets at night, the visuals never ceased to amaze me.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (10/10): Okay, so when my cousin showed me a small scene from the anime before I started watching it, I was struck by the music right away! I don't know how many times I've told her how much I love the music from this anime. The music is by Yoko Kanno, one of my favorite composers who also did the music in 'Wolf's Rain', 'Cowboy Bebop', and more. The soundtrack includes the help from musicians from different parts of the world, which shows that a lot of work was put into it. All of the different vocals are soft and calm, to match with the instrumentals. The opening is one of my favorites mostly because of the music. Aside from the soundtrack, the voice acting was spectacular. Each of the characters' voices were very mellow and pleasing to the ear. The emotion in their voices were very believable!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (9/10): This is one of the things I was worried about before watching this show. I was afraid that the characters would be underdeveloped and that it would be mostly focused on the action, but each episode seemed to develop the characters very well and made me really care about them. Before starting each episode I was excited to know more about them and see what would happen to them. The fact that they are terrorists made me wonder if I would be on their side, but the way that they were portrayed made me want to know more about them and hope for a happy ending for them. Anyway, the characters are realistic, understandable, and play a big part in the uniqueness of the anime. Most people wouldn't think to view it from their side of the story.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (9/10): Because it was so entertaining, creative, and very well put together, I give the enjoyment a 9/10. Some parts were a little confusing before it revealed things, but it was never too much to handle. When a new episode would come out, my cousin and I would be really excited, but also scared, because we didn't know what would happen to the characters. It's an emotional roller coaster, but an enjoyable one!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (10/10): 'Zankyou no Terror' is very different from most animes in which it focuses on a point-of-view that most would not think to see. I like it when you can see from a non-cliche perspective that questions views of society. The anime definitely exceeded my expectations and is probably one of the best that I've seen in a while. I enjoyed every minute of it and I loved the characters. It was artistically done by very talented people and a talented director. To me, this anime was a masterpiece. If you like a unique way of story-telling and a mind-capturing plot, then this is a must-see. However, if you are sensitive about things such as bombings and terrorism, you might not want to watch this. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants something new.",

The plot is something original, the pacing is steady. It will keep you on the edge of your seat every episode. The ending wraps up the show perfectly and will leave you hanging for a while.\r\nArt: 9\r\nThe character design is simple but notugly, although i wish there were more details. But the animation is buttery smooth, backgrounds have a realistic feel to them, making you more immersed in the anime. The quality is also consistent.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nWhile a lot of people like the OP of this anime, i don't. My tastes in music is pretty different from other people. But the ED is good. Background music is spectacular and adds tension in serious situations, and makes you feel sad in some.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThe characters of ZnK is good. Exepct from Lisa, which is your generic \"damsel in distress\", We got Nine and Twelve, a team of two person with interesting personality and mysterious motives. Five is also introduced later in the series, and her personality is interesting and likeable. But the star of the show is Shibazaki, a cop, who gets a lot of character development throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nZnK always keeps me at the edge of my seat every episode, and keep me waiting for the next. Watching it is like watching a movie splitted into 11 parts. I almost cried in the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an anime that's unique and different, or has good plot, animation. watch Zankyou no Terror. It's totally worth your time.",

            "content": "This is a spoiler free review.\r\nZankyou No Terror has a very intriguing idea which first drove me to watch this. The idea of the main characters being terrorists really appealed to me, as it is something that hasn\u2019t really been touched on at all. I decided then to give this anime a go and for the first 4 episodes I was not disappointed.\r\nThe Artwork and Sound are good without being amazing I thought, although the use of English language in this anime is terrible. The opening episodes have us seeing how the terrorists are committing these crimes. They leave riddles to the police to tryand find bombs that they have placed, making the first half of this anime a cat and mouse game. Up to this point I was very happy with this anime and was very interested to see where it would take me, from episode 4 new characters are introduced and there is a plot twist that certainly dimmed my enjoyment.\\n\r\nThe plot twist turns the characters around and the anime drops its terrorism theme until the last episode, which disappointed me greatly. A female (or actually two) character is introduced and focused on heavily in the last half of the anime, these bring in romantic elements. I really didn\u2019t like the switch since I hadn\u2019t seen enough development of the characters for me to believe in the second half of the story. The character development is really bad in this anime, the pacing is bad too. I didn\u2019t like the depth of the characters either, the main female probably had the most of this but her character was really bland for me. The main reason why I couldn\u2019t accept the last half was due to the fact that I couldn\u2019t empathise with the characters because things were moving too fast and not being explained enough. I got why the characters were doing what they were doing, but these were shown in small flashbacks and never expanded on, I got it but I wasn\u2019t convinced.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10- pacing is bad and character development is minimal. Plot twists are uninspiring\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10- Nothing bad, Nothing amazing\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10- horrible use of English language loses the points here(why do they never get a Seiyuu that can actually speak English?)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 5/10- Main characters are interesting but have no depth.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10- First half is great. Second half is very disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nI decided to give this a 5/10 because it has a good premise and is a solid anime, but I was disappointed since I thought it could have been a lot better with an interesting theme. If you are watching this for the terrorism theme then I\u2019d say you will be disappointed, however, if you\u2019re looking to fill your time with something this could satisfy you.",

            "content": "Oh, Zankyou no Terror... How much did I praise you during the early few episodes, but how could I know that you will turn out how you did. Zankyou no Terror (Terror in Resonance or Terror in Tokyo in English) was one of my most anticipated titles of the season and I am sure I was not alone. The show also gained a bit of a hype because of the famous Shinichiro Watanabe (Samurai Champloo, Cowboy Bebop), who I am in all honesty no big fan of, but okay, let's get this review started. Just make sure that I will NOT be able to hideall possible spoilers, so just read this review if you have already finished the show or dropped it and don\u2019t consider picking it up again! Or if you just don\u2019t care about spoilers...\\n\\n\r\nThe plot, or rather the premise, was what caught my attention and interest at first. \u201cAn anime about terrorism?\u201d Sounds thrilling alright, but sadly it turned out to be quite a train wreck with lose plot and lackluster characters in the long run. Basically the show is about two special kids, who build bombs and make them explode, but with no people around so nobody gets hurt. That\u2019s a weird characteristic for two young blooded terrorists, but there are reasons for this, obviously. And they announce their terrorist attacks on YouTube and ask the police riddles, so they may or may not stop the bomb from going off. That\u2019s what I was thought to be quite interesting and I was hoping for there to be a message behind the bombings and some deeper meaning and connections, but sadly that wasn\u2019t so.  Either I didn\u2019t get them, or the riddles were just there to make the show appear smart. The show generally shows its story from two perspectives, from the bomber\u2019s, naming themselves \u201cSphinx\u201d, and the police\u2019s perspective. What I found somewhat disappointing that there was no real tension during the moments when the investigations took place and the investigation process went waaaay too easy. I mean the main detective, Shibazaki, seemingly knows all of Greek mythology (that\u2019s what the riddles are mostly based on) and at one point he clears a riddle because he watches his fat friend play a video game. It reminded me of some cheap Hollywood movie in which the protagonist finds out some very important clue due to something a kid spouts. I\u2019m sure you know what I am talking about.\\n\\n\r\nHow the story played out felt a bit cheap in general. I mean Shibazaki (together with \"Five\" in the middle part of the anime) was the only one driving the plot along thanks to his super knowledge and his daughter who knows a lot about bombs and nukes. Also in the end he meets a few men who willingly agree to just tell him everything he wants to know in fullest detail, just because.\\n\\n\r\nAnother point when the show took a huge nosedive in my opinion, was when a former \u201cfriend\u201d of the main characters \u201cNine\u201d and \u201cTwelve\u201d was introduced as their nemesis, called \u201cFive\u201d. Five was basically the point on when I almost gave up on the show. She seemed just like a psychotic woman who had to stop Sphinx because the US said so. And to do this she went overboard multiple times, resulting in countless casualties, damages and wounded innocents along the way, for a ridiculous, nonsensical and compleely unjustified reason and motivation if you ask me. And she also did pointless and silly riddles with bombings, which the main characters now had to solve and disarm\u2026 While the character of Five was not complete useless, I do agree that she shouldn\u2019t have been there. They should have spent more time on the \"important characters\" and explore those more. Speaking of which.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole cast of characters was so lackluster, with barely any real explained motivations or fleshed out ones among them, the only decent one being the detective Shibazaki. He was the only one advancing the plot, but even this with the most trivial and convenient ways possible, like I told you before. I mean his relative and one friend gave away the location of the bomb in the last episode, oh my, how convenient indeed. It was so cheap I had to face palm. A lot of answers to the already mentioned riddles by Shibazaki where really sudden and there was never a clear train of thought to follow either him or the actual main protagonists, which was a shame. This could have been a great cat and mouse game like in Death Note, but it was not. There isn\u2019t much to talk about the two male main characters to be honest. Nine was the rather cold and distant guy, while Twelve was the funky and hyperactive one. They have flashbacks to their past every now and then, when the plot feels like it, and that\u2019s about it. We literally learn everything there is to them in the first two episodes, with their motivations being revealed in the very last episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe last character I want to mention is Lisa, Sphinx\u2019 female sidekick. She has a highly clingy mother and got bullied in school, that\u2019s where she first met Nine and Twelve, which was the most convenient and cheapest way to introduce her, because for whatever reason Sphinx joined a local school in episode 1, but where never ever seen there again, which makes it pointless and the yet again really, really cheap. Her relation with her mother seemed like an important plot point in the beginning, but was quickly abandoned and never talked about again, which is quie a shame. The only things she then really did where trying to cook for Sphinx, but messing up, helping them out a few times, but messing up, staying at home, but messing up and so on. She also gets kidnapped a few times to drive the plot along, but contributed nothing important or meaningful to the story whatsoever. As you can see, the writing is not really strong with this one. Sadly this doesn\u2019t change in the later episodes as well and even the conclusion was everything else than satisfying and quite anticlimactic. They basically shoved everything we already assumed down our throat in the most forced way possible, though at least it is complete and not inconclusive. That\u2019s a plus.\\n\\n\r\nBut thankfully the show is good in two aspects; visuals and sound. The animation was really good for the most part and especially in the first episode gorgeous. The explosions were fluent, the attention to detail on backgrounds and characters remarkable and the use of lighting and shadows impressive too. But sadly the anime has a few quality drops during its duration of 11 episodes and often likes to use 3DCG to animate even two background characters, which is really cheap and effortless if you ask me. Characters tend to lose a lot of detail once they move away from the screen too. Nothing new, but when the show does want to look good, it certainly does. The other thing I want to mention is the soundtrack by the famous Yoko Kanno (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Cowboy Bebop, Jin-Roh), which was done very well and especially during the show\u2019s high points in the last couple of episodes, the soundtrack really stood out. One particular scene being one scene in a Ferris Wheel, which was in all honesty my favorite moment of the show. The voice acting was solid, but no performance really stood out or caught my ear.\\n\\n\r\nBut even with all these flaws, Zankyou no Terror was one of my most anticipated shows each week during the summer 2014 season. The whole thrill of how things can turn out, what will happen next, really thrilled and captivated me, only to be let down again and again\u2026\\n\\n\r\nOkay, let\u2019s get to the verdict.\\n\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror was such a huge letdown for me in multiple aspects. This begins at the flow of the story, tons of unanswered questions and thin writing, the flat and weak characters and the unsatisfying, yet complete, conclusion of the show\u2019s plot. Zankyou no Terror could have been a great comment on terrorism and a huge controversial thing to talk and discuss about, but sadly it turned out to be a cheap and forgettable popcorn flick with fancy visuals and good music. Don\u2019t worry, Sphinx. I will remember you. I will remember you for being in a show with the first good English I heard in a long time and in my biggest disappointment of summer 2014.

            "content": "I'll start this review by saying I started watching this show with no prior knowledge about the writers and the premise, so I had no idea what to expect. What I found was a mature and compelling story that kept me entertained throughout the season.\r\nEven in such an amazing season, it managed to shine through as the anime that defined the summer of 2014. Even compared against such great shows as Gekkan shoujo, Tokyo Ghoul, RE:Hamatora and Aldnoah;Zero, Zankyou no Terror stood on top.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThere are many stories that focus on anti-heroes and terrorism, yet none have come close to the level of maturity foundin ZnT. This shows succeeded in areas that other shows such as Death Note faltered. You will find no edgy character development here; no shonen-esque elements. This is the kind of show that you could quite happily show to any non-anime orientated friends with confidence that they won't leave mid-way through, or that you will have to justify why so-and-so is making unnecessary fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of ZnT perfectly fits the tone of the show. There are many still-life scenes in ZnT, and each one perfectly captures the essence of Tokyo. After seeing Tokyo rendered in both Tokyo Ghoul and Tokyo ESP, the realistic  calming images in ZnT were a breath of fresh air. \\n\\n\r\nThe character design also mirrors the art style: realistic enough to provide a sense of severity, yet different enough to give the show an underlying artistic element.\\n\\n\r\nDespite some background characters lacking detail in some parts, this is expected for the first release of an airing show and does no detract from the overall excellence. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are very few shows in which I decide to buy the OST, and even fewer in which I will continue to listen to the songs many weeks later. These songs bear a strong resemblance to 'songs from a cold country' which is a phrase that will become clear if you watch ZnT. In short: the sound is beautiful, elegant and very melancholic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\\n\r\nBoth 9 and 12 have starkly contrasting personalities: 9 being blunt and mature with 12 being childish and playful. Lisa describers them as having'a smile like the sun and eyes like ice'. However it goes far deeper than that. Underneath 9's calm exterior lies indescribable grief, and under 12's smile lies a form of severity to match 12s.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point many watchers would criticise Lisa fir being 'bland' or simply a plot device. However it is impossible to imagine the show without her. Not only does she create a contrast, with her troubles with her mother against 9 and 12 orphan statues, she shows a great deal of development over the show's progression.\\n\\n\r\nFinally I will touch on the characters in the police force, and how ZnT manages to capture adults in such an appropriate way. The police are neither shown as mindless soldiers, nor as clumsy un-organised oafs, and although the duo play along with them, the police are never antagonised. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFrom episode 1 I was hooked. No other show kept my interest like ZnT. Now that it is over I feel as if I have gained something from the experience\\n\\n\r\nTo summarise, Zankyou no Terror showed a level of maturity and elegance I never expected from anime, and it is my hope that other shows in the future will learn from ZnT. \\n",

            "content": "Zankyou No Terror is not a show about terrorism. \r\nBefore you roll your eyes and point your finger at the obvious \u201cTerror\u201d emblazoned in the title, I am serious on this one. While the topic is addressed at times, the crime thriller genre is merely a tool the show wields to sculpt out its socio-political commentary on Japan. If you are expecting a deep-seated exploration of the subject of terrorism, this show will not satisfy you. So please chuck those expectations into the trash and enjoy the show for what it is. Zankyou No Terror tells an engaging tale of generational conflicts, post-war nationalism, isolationfrom modern society and the hopeful rebellious spirit of youths.\\n\\n\r\nThe story kicks off in a grounded, realistic setting of present day Tokyo. 2 teenage terrorists, who go by the names of Nine and Twelve blow up the Tokyo Metropolitan Government building, and in the process accidentally involves a girl called Lisa Mishima. Flashbacks reveal Nine and Twelve to have escaped from a mysterious institution when they were children, hence cloaking their motivations in mystery. From then on, the show continues its crime procedural routine that lasts for a few episodes: Nine and Twelve would plant a bomb, release a video on Youtube under the name \u2018Sphinx\u2019 and challenge the police to solve a given riddle before the next bomb explodes. All the riddles are based on the Greek tragedy Oedipus Rex, and interesting choice that gives the audience parallels to think about- especially the idea of patricide and sacrifice in the pursuit of truth. We also get introduced to Shibazaki, a detective who gets caught up in the cat and mouse game against Sphinx. He is a character whoe has been casted out from society just like Sphinx and Lisa. These first few episodes are thematically condensed and provide solid insights into modern society.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Zankyou No Terror are not complex, after all, the show is more thematically-focused as compared to being character-focused. Zankyou No Terror is not condoning the main characters\u2019 acts of violence, rather, it wants the viewers to reflect about why they were forced into committing those acts.  The show does succeed in evoking the emotional depths of its main terrorist duo and Lisa: the need to escape from the clutches of modern society, the youthful drive to challenge the world that rejected them, the yearning for human connection. This would not have been possible without the brilliant aesthetics and production, which are definitely the show\u2019s strongest point. The polished direction is among the best in recent memory, taking the viewing experience to a cinematic level at times. The show efficiently manipulates camera angles and colour palettes to heighten atmosphere, while the lighting frames the scenes purposefully, stirring up a sense of alienation. Yoko Kanno absolutely delivers when it comes to the Icelandic-inspired soundtrack- the music is a blend of acoustic and electronic that sets the mood perfectly, constantly evoking the melancholy felt by the characters. It brought in the pathos needed to execute the best moments of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOf course the show is not without its faults, which mostly lie in the script. The show takes a generic popcorn thriller route at times, and when you have a show that is rooted in realism (even referencing Tor and virtual currency), many events ended up requiring suspension of disbelief, which might put off some viewers. This fault appeared with the introduction of the show\u2019s antagonist, Five, an agent deployed by the U.S government. The intervention of the US highlighted the problematic relationship between Japan and U.S., but Five came off too cartoonish. As a childhood friend of Nine and Twelve from the mysterious institution, her abnormal upbringing might have been the reason for her hugely childish behavior, but she often went overboard with her dramatic theatrics. The setup of her plans were ridiculous and Hollywoodesque, which led to silly contrived scenarios that clashed with the tone of the show. When her arc came to a close, she was cast in a more humanized and sympathetic light, but her character did more harm than good to the show. Thankfully, the show picked up again afterwards, where it made an interesting choice in joining the narrative with the ongoing issue of Japan\u2019s rising nationalism.  \\n\\n\r\nIn spite of its shaky narrative, Zankyou No Terror is a show that presented relevant themes and concluded with an emotional ending. The show does not fully dig into its themes or answer the questions raised, but it articulates its reflections on society well and its best scenes are truly memorable and affecting. It is an ambitious and passionate production with plenty of substance to appreciate. \\n",

            "content": "In a season filled with giant robots, teenage dramas and supernatural violence, Zankyou no Terror stands out from the usual crowd with its focus on the rarely explored subject matter of terrorism.  Shinichir\u014d Watanabe, renowned director of Cowboy Bebop,  Samurai Champloo, and Kids on the Slope, once again teams up with Yoko Kanno and the newly formed Studio MAPPA to delivers one of the highlights of the summer season 2014.  \r\nZankyou no Terror or Terror in Resonance, opens up with two mysterious male teenagers named Nine and Twelve, carrying out a heist at a nuclear fuel reprocessing facility and ends up stealinga device that contains plutonium. Six months later, in the sweltering heat of summer, both of them, call themselves Sphinx, commit a series of terrorist attacks on Tokyo under and caught up in their schemes, is a teenage girl named Mishima. Through a series of circumstances, she willingly becomes an accomplice in their plans to pull the trigger on the world. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nHaving spent their entire lives together, I felt that Nine and Twelve are two sides of the same coin with the same intentive goals in mind but exhibiting different mannerism as they go about their terrorism business. Nine is your emotionally distant teenager in glasses and approaches the work of Sphinx in a business-like manner. The Ying to Nine's Yang, Twelve more like a playful cat than anything else by the way he plays with a grenade as if it was a ball and prefers to drive a motorcycle when speeding his way through traffic.  Both of them are extremely  intelligent and  physically capable and they soon make short work of anyone sent to apprehend them.  The catch is that, while their acts of terrorism causes an enormous amount of damage, they are setup in such a manner that no fatal causalities occur. It is to the testament to Watanabe's skill that viewers can relate to characters like Nine/Twelve instead of the psychopathic monsters that the mainstream media often demonize terrorists as. \\n\\n\r\nCompletely opposite to the our males in every way possible is a female highschooler named Lisa Mishima. She comes across Twelve during their demolition of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building and given a choice between dying or becoming a member of Sphinx, she chooses the latter. Casted out by society due to her broken family and being the constant target of bullying by her classmates, Lisa garners a fair bit of compassion from me. While I was sympathetic to her situation in the earlier episodes, as the series went on, my patience began to wear thin at just how inept this depressed teenage girl is at everything. It would be too much for me to expect that she would turn into a goddess of terrorism but a little more usefulness out of her would have gone a long way into fostering that emotional connection with the audience.  I do admit, realistically speaking, for a bumbling depressed schoolgirl to be involved with such large-scale destruction, Lisa plays that role to a T.\\n\\n\r\nHot on the heels of Sphinx is Shibazaki, a former ace detective who comes back to active duty as he  successfully decrypts the various riddles. He certainly doesn't fall short in the characterization department  as I perfectly understood his motivations when comes to stopping Nine/Twelve. Being an old grizzled man filled with experience, he has the demeanor  of a mature adult who is very committed to the idea of justice. At the same time, he does have these nonchalant moments that make him feel like a real investigative veteran accustomed to the norms of the world. \\n\\n\r\n Even though Lisa did get a little on my nerves, I did genuinely  enjoyed all the characters and their journey throughout the show for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nFor the most part. \\n\\n\r\nFive\\n\\n\r\nOf course, even though the next major character is a bit of a spoiler, I cannot ignore the effect that Five had on the show when she is introduced partway through the story. Being the primary antagonist by working against Sphinx and subjugating the Japanese law enforcement agencies, she is, by far the weakest part of Zankyou no Terror. Clad in a sailor school uniform, she brings an wildly overbearing presence into the story with her antics and games. The first of two issues that I have with her is that she seemed too omnipotent when facing off with the already formidable Sphinx and damages much of the grounded realism that the show sets itself up as. Second,  I could dismisses her bat-shit crazy actions if her character had an interesting motivation and background but Zankyou no Terror drops the ball in that aspect leaving only hints of what might have been a fantastic villain. It's not that I wish that Five didn't exist but I want to see her character be rewritten in a way that was more restrained and  fleshes out her story. That being said, she was anything but dull and was at least entertaining, even when her actions didn't jive with the core plot. \\n\\n\r\nVisuals and Sound\\n\\n\r\nAccompanying our band of teenage terrorist on their quest for vengeance is the stellar soundtrack by anime legend, Yoko Kanno. Having worked on Cowboy Bebop, Ghost in the Shell: SAC and Macross Frontier fame, she produces a sound that is insidious, subversive and unsettling for the viewers. With haunting guitar riffs, subtle electronic beats and jazzy undertones coupled with the occasional outburst of sound during action scenes, Yoko Kanno skillfully tailored her composition to suit the gritty tense atmosphere of Zankyou no Terror. \\n\\n\r\nStudio MAPPA has done an absolutely breathtaking job when it comes to the animation quality and comes close to what is expected of an anime movie instead of an ordinary TV production. One of the first things that viewers will notice are the muted colors and attention to detail that is intended to sets up modern-day Tokyo to be as realistic as possible. Backgrounds are expertly detailed from the reflective sheen on vehicles in traffic to the cluttered mess of a former detective's office to a Ferris wheel glowing in the rainy night sky as it carries its passengers on a ride. When it comes to 3D CGI, which is often a tricky thing to balance out in anime, it done to support the various angles and scene composition to gives Zankyou no Terror its cinematic quality. Although Studio MAPPA is still a newcomer in the industry, it has demonstrated it has the talent and potential to become a powerhouse within anime. \\n\\n\r\nThemes\\n\\n\r\nAside from the very pretty explosions,  Zankyou no Terror has pretty of depth to draw from with its ideas of a increasingly modernized society and its pitfalls while alluring to ancient mythology. By incorporating fancy pieces of technology like Twitter, YouTube and virtual currency as well , it makes the viewers think about the fragility of our current reality. Although, it doesn't provide any answers, Watanabe's work is certainly more than capable of generating an immense amount of discussion as to what it all means for the characters and our current world.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion \\n\\n\r\nFrom the very beginning, I knew that Zankyou no Terror was going to be one of the very top shows from the summer season and maybe even earn a very rare 10/10 score from me. The question was whether it would be able to maintain the standard set out by the initial episode and the answer teeter somewhere between an 8 and 9. Lisa and Five certainly didn't do the show any favors as they could have as they represented the polar opposites of either being useless or completely all-powerful and insane. If Lisa would have been a little more capable and Five was toned down while given a complete back story, I would be incline to award higher marks overall. Other than those two flawed characters, every other aspect of Zankyou no Terror, from the distinct soundtrack by Yoko Kanno to the cinematic visual direction of Watanabe and his take on the touchy subject of  terrorism mixed in with a little conspiracy, is certainly not lacking in quality nor relevancy. \\n\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "If you had a tough childhood, blow up an atomic bomb.\r\nZankyou no Terror is an original psychological thriller show. It is a different take on terrorism, and received massive hype during its airing for supposedly \"thrilling\" and \"realistic\" execution. However, what's the anime really about? A couple of kids running around bombing stuff to solve their problems.\r\nPlot:\r\nA video on the internet regarding a mysterious group called \"Sphynx\" gets the attention of Japan after unknown people destroy a Tokyo Government building. Nine and Twelve, children with number codenames and the masterminds behind the terrorism act, begin their game of riddles where the result of failure isa bomb detonation, while leaving subtle messages behind the bombings.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is seemingly very intriguing and unique at first, with the audience starting to wonder what's this all about and what's the point behind it. Sadly, that ends with the premise. Nothing really important happens from the main plot in this show. It's summed up very easily - a bunch of kids are playing a riddle game in hopes for someone to come and solve their problems, all of this with a bomb twist. The way they wanted to make this all happen is incredibly stupid and unlogical, and it just becomes obvious that explosions exist for the sake of explosions.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no real depth or a message this anime wants to translate: everything is just extremely shallow. We get no idea as to why the main characters wanted to approach the situation this exact way, or how the hell did they manage to do it. It is praised as being \"very innovative - exploring the society's problems in a unique way\", and dear god that's just so wrong. Despite the popular belief, and that the anime thinks it has that, there's actually no terrorism in this show. \"Terror\" as a word means \"to frighten\". \"Terrorism\" - acts that are intended to create fear, are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal or for demands. None of these things apply to the show, sans the last one which is so subtly hinted that it is impossible to derive it in such a way without relying on massive amount of plot conveniences. (which this anime uses for god knows how many times). Fear doesn't exist in the show, because there's no global perspective - it feels like the bombings are just an everyday thing and nobody cares much that their lives are constantly in danger. So what do we get? A useless plot element. It is just suprising why the characters don't do the first logical thing possible and instead create an extremely unlikely plan that is almost sure to not work (but because of plot convieniences, that becomes possible) and has the exact same result in the end.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of the show suffer from being one-dimensional and uncharacterized. The main protagonists, Nine and Twelve, have their own personality traits (Twelve being sweet and easy-going, Nine being serious and determined), but that's about it. Their backdrop is hinted to be something extremely horrible, but it is never elaborated in the show. Instead, the fragments of their backstory just randomly inserted, and it is impossible to actually guess the scale of importance of the events in their past until much later in the anime, when it comes off as very disappointing and underwhelming reveal. The main problem with the protagonists, though, are that they just don't fit to be terrorists. The show attempts to please the casual viewers by making the main characters a pair of teenagers that are super smart, but it forgets to also give enough of a motive for them to start doing what they're doing this exact way and not just going to the police and tell them what the hell happened in their past.\\n\\n\r\nThe pair is joined by Lisa, who receives a lot of attention early on, but nothing happens with her character. She joins the duo simply to be a plot device and to drive the conflict of Five and the protagonists the way the anime wants to it to go. She has her own personal problems, but they're not focused on, and she just comes off as a dull character with a clumsy trait. She receives no reasonable development and apart from one scene, extremely irrelevant to the story, so it's really sad to see the potential and the focus shown to her early on being wasted.\\n\\n\r\nNext on we have the antagonist Five. Okay, she is an extremely stupidly written character. Her motives are contradicting, she gets the same cliched antagonist traits and actually is irrelevant to the end result. I personally have no idea why she was needed in the anime, most of the logical inaccuracies happen around her, and she is a fresh air of \"generic\" in a rather unique anime. The anime just wasn't fit to include a character like her, and that can be witnessed in her last scene in the show which was probably the stupidiest thing I've ever seen in anime this year.\\n\\n\r\nThe best character of the show is Shibazaki, and he's a friggin plot device. That's how sad it is. He is the \"plot convienience\" Sphynx was searching for to fulfill their insanely unlogical and impossible plan. Shibazaki gets some character development, has some sort of a character backstory that is somewhat believable and reflects on his current character quite well, but he gets pushed into a side role after Five is introduced. His personal drama wasn't elaborated much, but he was the only character on which \"the rule of cool\" worked. It was much more enjoyable and believable to watch him solve the riddles than witnessing Sphynx presenting them (why so serious?)\\n\\n\r\nThe side cast doesn't really exist in this show. Everything revolves around 4 (5 with Shibazaki's sidekick) characters in a story that actually has the entire population of Tokyo in direct influence. All other characters are just plot devices that are there to assume a certain position and for the anime to have realism in this aspect, but they are completely irrelevant. And since the next segment is going to talk about how there's no realism in this show at all, the above point becomes moot.\\n\\n\r\nWriting:\\n\\n\r\nAnd here we go. The most pretentious anime of the year. Let's start off with the impossibilities. It is IMPOSSIBLE to have no casualties after you destroy such a massive building. 9/11 had around 300 people killed on ground level, excluding the firefighters which is another 300. Total number of injured people was 7000. Here, we have no casualties even though the entire evacuated group happened to be next to the building when it exploded, and a mere 50 injuries. That's just so bullshit and immediately kills any immersion. You have a girl jumping from the 4th floor on the ground and she doesn't even get her legs broken, let alone a scratch or bruise? Are you seriously telling me two teenagers stole a friggin atomic bomb from a mass security nuclear facility? And are you seriously telling me the government took 0 actions to find out more about that and locate the stolen bomb before the attacks started happening? And it's just the first episode, guys. There's atleast dozen occurences of straight up impossible and illogical bullshit in every episode. It slows down between the second and the fourth episode, and that's where I thought the anime could actually be good but shit hits the fan again when Five is introduced and we witness the greatest chess game ever - using airport terminals.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the riddles, the whole method is stupid and over the top. The duo needed the exact guy who was willing to research them this exact way, and they found a guy not only willing to do that but who was also a part of an incident which involved someone affiliated with their problem - what are the odds! We are never shown how they plant their bombs or how they manage to create them - everything already seems to be completed and in place and then we just need to wait for a boom. The pair are terrorists, but it was cringe-worthy watching them go nuts over a bomb which couldn't be defused, and that they could be labeled as murderers. The fact is that if this anime followed any string of proper logic, they would already be murderers at the very first bombing.\\n\\n\r\nThe thriller part is done very, very weakly. The whole thriller is that the audience doesn't know what the characters know but don't reveal because TENSION! That's not thrilling to watch, that's just f*cking frustrating. Their whole story is very predictable, it is very obvious that something happened in their childhood and they wanted revenge but there wasn't enough motive to start blowing stuff up, as the scale of events in their childhood wasn't so bad or shocking, and they were probably too young to understand all that. We have no information on what happened inbetween their childhood and the present events, and the duo talks like the Rising Hope Academy thing happened yesterday, when in reality anyone would most likely forget it over time (and sure as hell wouldn't start blowing up the city). The anime tries to make everything complex and mature and deep but everything comes out so messy that even a 10 year old child could write a more fluent script than this.\\n\\n\r\nThere is just way too much to talk about in this section, but I need to keep this short enough and not to spoil anything. The anime is not clever, it is pretentious. It tries to be something that it's not, and tries to be something that it fails to be. Since the show relies solely on being \"logical\" and \"thrilling\", if there are no other elements to get hooked to, you simply cannot enjoy this show because it's not \"logical\" and \"thrilling\". The only thing that is positive and worth mentioning is that there's no fanservice in this show. The comedy is very very little but it doesn't fit, but because there's almost none of it that's not a problem.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nCredit will be given where credit is due. Animation looks salad in this one, especially the explosions. The character designs are okay, although Five looks like a clown for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I would like to talk about more is the soundtrack. Yoko Kanno nails one yet again. It is the best soundtrack of the year, with amazing piano arrangements and dramatical music fitting perfectly with the atmosphere. Standalone songs, such as \"Hanna\", are just amazing to listen. Overall, soundtrack is the only thing I really enjoyed in this show, and I have no complaints and arguments against it. The sound is also well made, the explosions sound realistically, especially in the last episode. The only complaint I have in the sound department is the awful Engrish and subpar voice acting in general, although Shunsuke Sakuya did a good job voicing Shibazaki.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening to the show is beautifully animated with decent music, but strangely enough, it doesn't fit with the anime at all. What is overlooked is the ending to the anime, which is simply animated but has some beautiful music and I ended up enjoying it way more than the opening.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\\n\r\nZankyou No Terror is the definition of a pretentious anime, and a victim of the Code Geass R2 syndrome. It is overhyped because it is \"different\" in execution and the themes. Mind if I tell you, that being \"unique\" is not automatically being \"good\"? It has an amazing soundtrack, but I suggest just buying the OST album instead of watching this, if it's just for the music. Overall, a disapponting watch, but if you want something pretentiously clever you could check this out.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 3.9/10",

            "content": "**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**\r\nFrom the ensemble of Watanabe and Yoko Kanno who brought us Cowboy Bebop, comes together once again to bring us a work that has quickly garnered attention from the anime community, Zankyou No Terror. It's easy to see why ZnT will catch the eye of the masses. And it's even understandable why, to some degree, it receives such positive praise. In a time where the anime community is saturated with school rom coms, run of the mill fanservice moe blobs and bishounen \"self insert\" plot armored protagonists, ZnT certainly has a refreshing change of pace. It brings a concept to the tablethat allows a much needed  breather from the monotonous mass produced clones. However a good concept is only good if executed well. And this is where the line is drawn between those that offer immense praise and others who don't take things at face value. \\n\r\nYou see ZnT is a notorious example of an anime using the 'Bait-and-switch' method to draw an audience in. It 'baits' you in by offering a premise involving terrorism and  then 'switches' to a show that provides social criticism of it's government. Because of this concept, ZnT is given a mirage of bloated self importance. Although you'll be hard-pressed to freely share actual criticism of it's missteps since this show has given rise to a rabid fanbase that will chew your heard off for uttering a single word of disagreement.\\n\r\nWithout question ZnT can be credited with great presentation and production values but that's all superficial qualities and doesn't inherently equate it to actual quality. With everything that ZnT had going for it, it seem to have forgotten the key elements that separates a solid show from one that HAD the potential to be a solid show.\\n\r\nToday we'll break apart the categories of Story, Characters, Art, & Sound to point out where this show with unrepresented potential went wrong.\\n\\n\r\nFirst lets get the obvious areas in which it excels out of the way\\n\r\n[Art/Animation & Sound: 9.5/10 & 9/10]\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation for ZnT was top-tier in almost all aspects. Every scene was gorgeous from beginning to end, with great attention to detail and proper use of shading and lighting in every frame. The  fluid aesthetics breathed life into every scene and helped to make the choreographed actions displayed to have weight behind it. This was further heightened by the creator's mastery of cinematography. From the unique camera angles, to the unorthodox shot compositions, to the camera panning, everything gave off a cinematic look. This made immersion almost instantaneous. It's a firm grip on presentation that's worthy of admiration and praise.\\n\r\nThe color palettes were also used to optimum affect with a clear understanding of color placement and color theory. They were changed in accordance to the mood the show was trying to convey. To the bleached acid washed look of a hot summer day, to a dark shrouded room that gave a sense of isolation. Every color choice and shading felt intentional and properly utilized. The character designs weren't all unique but for the most part they were a cut above the rest. They served their purpose in establishing the traits of the individuals even before we hear them talk. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nLike the animation, the sound was no exception, being the best soundtrack I've heard in ages. But that's to be expected when the talented Yoko Kanno is the one behind it. The tracks came in various forms, most predominantly ambient and melancholic vocals. Every scene was accompanied with an impressive score, that shared great chemistry with the accompanying actions showed. It also have the honor of being the among the few soundtracks I've been compelled to download right off the bat. Standout tracks being \"hanna\" , \"von\" , \"is\", \"walt\" and many more. It's a great stand alone listen and one I've revisited several times.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNOW, time to address the issues that many turn a blind eye too.\\n\r\n[Characters & Story: 2/10 & 3/10]\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThese characters aren't even treated as actual people. More like a range of archetypes and plot devices. They simply slap on a grim backstory and act like that's enough to be called \"characters\"\\n\\n\r\nTo quickly run them down you have:\\n\\n\r\n9 = your intellectual \"according to plan\" stone faced archetype \\n\r\n12 = your innocent turn \"sadistic psycho\" at a drop of a hat archetype\\n\r\nShibazaki = the veteran detective guy. You know, the guy you find in every single cop/mystery show in media's existence\\n\r\n5 = the 1 note psychotic bitch archetype\\n\r\nand Finally Lisa, the \"can't do anything right\" girl.\\n\\n\r\n9 & 12 despite being our MCs have nothing outside of a sad backstory and archetype throughout the shows run, and with that said there's very little worth mentioning about them. They simply exists to commit the terrorist acts from which we will discuss soon.\\n\r\n5, Shibazaki and Lisa  were your plot devices. 5 serving no true purpose as an antagonist other than being evil for the sake of being evil, was just thrown in to foil 9 & 12's plans. Her quirky out of place characteristic destroys all the real world aspects the show crafted by being as bombastic and over the top as possible. And the biggest sin of her as a character is that she added absolutely nothing to the shows overall story. This in turn makes the middle portion involving her feel like filler. I dare you to rewatch the anime after completion and skip the scenes with her involvement and prove me wrong. A show given a short 11 episode runtime and half of it was essentially unnecessary. \\n\r\nLisa serves no purpose outside of being the punching bag/sympathy token character that always fuck shit up. She was also a huge missed opportunity for actual development from the rest of the stagnant cast. Shibazaki being the only character that felt... well, like a character, was given less screentime so Lisa can continue to go around being a damsel in distress.  By dumbing everyone down, Shibazaki is made to be a genius detective, while the rest of cops are made out to be bumbling buffoons.\\n\r\nAlso the show is guilty of treating the US government as a 1 dimensional Saturday morning cartoon type of villainous group, which doesn't help with immersion. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nNow it's not a bad thing that ZnT strayed from it's initial premise, many other shows have done it before. But when the concept is stripped bare-bones what's really left is a tail of kids that perform drastic measures in order to get noticed. Despite the show's down to earth setting it asks the viewer to suspend their disbelief to think that their acts of terrorism don't affect anyone. When does blowing up a building, that possibly provided hundreds of jobs, not be considered a harmful act? Because they made sure it was vacant? These actions are played out with a cinematic flare but the actual ramifications of said actions are never even brought up. Not to mention the thousands of lives that may have possibly depended on that source of income from working in those targeted facilities.  When do we as viewers decide that a couple of kids false sense of conviction is not illogical. Or when do we question the incompetent way the entire populace of Japan and the police are treated. For a show that is trying to be \"down to earth\" how can it excuse a country that's ranked #1 in education in the world, but can't figure out such mediocre riddles that's broadcast for all to see it. \\n\r\nBut you don't have to take my word for it--> http://worldtop20.org/the-worlds-best-20-education-systems-rankings-third-quarter-report\\n\\n\r\nIt's ok not to mirror real world expectations but when a show is trying to be as close to the real world as possible it needs to uphold a certain degree of believability . If ZnT was trying to present itself as actual fiction then this wouldn't be a problem. But direct commentary and social criticism of one's real world government needs to be handled with better finesse. \"Japan's inferiority complex towards the US\" was treated so lopsidedly that its questionable how it even made it past the rough draft for a final script.\\n\\n\r\nNow the 2nd half of the story is suppose to be the mystery behind 9 & 12's origins and the purpose behind their actions. I don't know about you but a mystery is suppose to keep you guessing and finding clues. But when everything, and I do mean everything, is shown to us in the form of visual exposition within the 1st few episodes then what's the point of continuing to present it as a mystery. Not much of a \"mystery\" at all but the show continues to drag us along to an inevitable conclusion that you've already seen coming. Now the purpose for their actions can be to open the eyes of the Japanese populace or it can be said they wanted to shed light on the government's actions. But when it comes to it all the speculations are simply that, speculations. It's a rather ambiguous ending that shows neither consequences nor the effect of their actions. In other words their actions lacked any substance. Speculations are fine but that's simply inserting answers which the show never said was there. We'd like to think that's what it means but with no solid answer to the madness nothing is given merit. Even up to the very end it needed external knowledge from the viewer for the show to stand on it's own.  That's the epitome of lazy storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nIn short ZnT relied too heavily on presentation but lack actual substance.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe 1st few episodes of ZnT were exceptional but it quickly became a blundering mess. An easy to swallow treat for the visual/audible senses but a brain rot with half-assed characters & story. In other words it's an anime without a soul. As a cinematic experience it gets top marks but for a show that had such high ambitions it fell short. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nIn a day and age where otaku pandering and excessive fan service  is the norm, a show like Zankyou no Terror has stuck out for not following conventions. If you're simply looking for a beautifully crafted show then this is for you. But if you want substance with your presentation then this  might not be up to par.",

            "content": "The concept of terrorism is a rather scary and ambiguous one in today's society. Terrorism comes in all sorts of ways; cyber hacking to bombing buildings to mass murdering people. Zankyou no Terror's terrorism was a bit different though. Zankyou no Terror's hype came not only from the fact that Shinichiro Watanabe directed it, but also because of it's new, intriguing terrorism plot. Although I'm not particularly a fan of so-called \"deep\" anime, I gave Zankyou no Terror a try and due to my lack of psychological thinking, I got rather confused on many parts that seemed to not make sense. Nonetheless, it was anenjoyable anime overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about 2 teenage boys, and one teenage girl. The two boys, Touji Hisami and Arata Kokonone also known as Sphinx #9, and Sphinx #12, are the 2 terrorists. They call themselves, \"Sphinx\" and they send riddle question videos to the government, always giving the government a hint to where they planted a bomb. But for some reason, it seems as though Touji and Arata want the government to find the bomb, they have no desire to actually cause an explosion, but rather just a \"terror\". Meanwhile, the main character girl, Lisa gets tangled up in all of Sphinx's plans and ends up making a decision to join them as an accomplice. On the police's side, there's an ex-detective named Kenjiro Shibazaki who is the only one who can answer Sphinx's riddles, and as the plot progresses he seems to develop an understanding of what and who \"Sphinx\" is. Then... there's a female American government operative, \"Five\" who has some kind of connection to Sphinx's past, and is devoted to catching Sphinx and reuniting herself with Arata Kokonoe. And so the anime's entire plot will become a 3-way psychological cat-mouse game between the japanese police, the American operatives and Sphinx. Questions such as \"Where will they go from there? What is \"Sphinx\"? What are Sphinx's motifs? Who exactly are the \"bad-guys\" in the anime? What is \"right\"? all arise throughout.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot will start off a bit slow, but once it gets going, it is rather interesting. I thought the plot was rather realistic with some unrealism here and there (^o^). The realism comes from the theme: corrupt in society today. But how they achieve that theme was quite unrealistic to me... Somehow a psychopathic psycho like Five became the head of the American Governments Operations in Japan which leaves me dumbfounded; there's no way in reality a psycho like that would become a leader, even with all the corruption. There's even more no way that Sphinx could plant all those bombs without being caught. And EVEN more no way that Lisa, an innocent girl would just join Sphinx and not feel worried/scared at all and not tell anybody about them. If I was Lisa, I'd be scared out of my mind! Despite it's questionable problems, I enjoyed watching the anime every week. The beginning of the anime starts off with a bam, as Touji and Arata were being the terrorists they are, and bombing a place. I honestly think this anime tried a little bit too much to be \"deep\". All the riddles were said to be \"symbolic\" by many \"deep\" thinking viewers, but the riddles were plain riddles derived from Greek Mythology. There really was no life lesson, or deep motif behind them, unless I missed something. The anime was kind of confusing to me. Without spoiling too much, one example of complete confusion was towards the middle of the anime when Sphinx and Five were facing off at an airport. Every move that Five made, and every move that Sphinx made were symbolized by a chess move, which made absolutely no sense. It's like, if Touji went to the bathroom to change into a cops cloth, then that'd be considered \"Bishop B-6\", and if Five sent 5 guards to the bathroom, then that's \"Queen to C-2\", like it made absolutely no sense; there was no correlation. With that said, there were good moments throughout the anime as well, such as the ending which left me happy in it's on way; leaving me in tears. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters was where I had some problems. I liked Sphinx, Arata and Touji; they were the bright spots in the anime. They were developed to the fullest; we learn of their past, their motif, their character, and most importantly their destined goal/fate. If you want to be a terrorist, then follow the footsteps of Arata and Touji, not any other psychopathic monster. Now, the problems started with Lisa, then went on to Five, and when the anime ended I also had some problems with Kenjiro the Japanese Detective's character. As I mentioned before, Lisa shows absolutely no sense of fear when she becomes part of a terrorist group. Some people argue that it's because she has nothing to lose; she gets bullied, she basically has no family since her mother is Coo-Coo and father abandoned her, and she has absolutely nothing in life to look forward to. But, that doesn't take away the fact that Lisa randomly joins Sphinx without hesitation, like really?... But then to add on to that, Lisa's character at first seems like someone you can remorse for, but that's not the case. Quickly Lisa's character develops into a joke. Lisa helps Sphinx do absolutely nothing except make Arata and Touji less lonely. It bothered me how the anime made Lisa seem useless while making the males seem genius and perfect. As for Five, she was just plain annoying and her entire reason for trying to capture Sphinx was pathetic. I won't spoil it, but it really was dumb. And her methods to try and catch Sphinx were cray-cray! It's like she's a government representing villain terrorist, and Arata and Touji are the heroic justice league. Kenjiro's character started with lots of potential, but then the story started to solely focus upon Arata, Touji, Lisa, and Five, leaving Kenjiro's character to rot in the dust until the end of the anime. A waste of a great character at it's finest. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was great. Certainly a different type of art then the usual art. But, it fit in very nicely with the anime's overall mood; it portrayed the realism of terrorism. The darkness/grayness of the art in the anime was nice. I felt like the character's appearances were perfect to their personality. Lisa looks like the typical clumsy girl, Touji looks like the typical open yet mysterious boy, Arata looks like the scar-filled hero, Five looks like the psychopath that she is, and Detective Kenjiro looks like a smart, lazy, mature, and in the end, heroic man himself. As for the music, it wasn't superb, but it was decent. The opening sounded mysterious which was nice, and I liked the animations of the opening too. The opening really portrayed the anime well. There were no other great soundtracks, but none of them were bad, and they did fit in rather nicely with the entire \"terrorism\" concept. The voicing of the characters fit in nicely with each character, especially Lisa, so I praise them for that.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest problem with the anime is honestly not the anime itself, but all the people that call it \"genius\" simply because it's psychological, and about terrorism, hence leading it to be a \"masterpiece\". All the so-called symbolism is something that I personally didn't see in the anime, and if I missed something then feel free to message me explaining all the so-called \"deep-symbolism\". Also, the anime over-exaggerates it's theme of \"corruption\". I do hear about and understand the corruption of the government, but the government itself isn't a terrorist organization, and there are no terrorists in reality that are exactly honorable and heroic. And with that being said, this anime is certainly an anime that I'd recommend to people that enjoy psychological thrillers but also to anyone that wants to watch an anime that will make their brains think. Despite my confusion in some parts of the anime, the parts that I did understand, I enjoyed. The plot was interesting, art was perfect for the anime, sound was good, characters had some problems but were still decent thanks to the 2 mysterious anti-heroic main characters, and all in all it was rather enjoyable. Thanks for reading!",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nZankyou no Terror has easily been one of the most well received anime of the season, and understandably so. It has amazing presentation, unique and memorable music, and it\u2019s directed by motherfucking Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, etc.). After a fantastic first episode filled with intrigue and mystery, the worldwide anime community waited with bated breath to see what this show had in store. So\u2026 While some people were able to continue to enjoy the show from beginning to end, watching the rest of this anime for me was more comparable to staring, frozen at the sight of a terrible accident that killshundreds of people. It\u2019s fucking horrible and gets worse and worse with each passing second\u2026 but you can\u2019t look away. From the worst antagonist in recent memory to poor character development and a plot the goes downhill fast, this anime can only be described as a shame. Looking at what this anime could have been and comparing it to what it ended up being, it\u2019s nothing but a damn shame.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: Two teenagers, who go by the codename \u201cSphinx\u201d, have managed to steal plutonium from a high tech facility. They then go on a spree of terrorism, bombing building after building as the police department scrambles to diffuse the bombs and apprehend the perpetrators. Sphinx\u2019s reasons for doing this are unclear, even to the auidance.\\n\\n\r\nQuite honestly, I think that Zankyou no Terror has perfectly defined the term \u201cdragging it out\u201d. Many people scratched their heads when they realized that the show was only 11 episodes long, but in hindsight, it didn\u2019t even need to be THAT long. The true downfall of the anime is that it\u2019s story and characters are very, very shallow, despite the occasional intrigue they are able to illicit. While the plot starts strong as it presents a relatively believable, realistic setting, the show soon begins a downward spiral into complete, nonsensical absurdity. For instance, the show loses all of its subtlety and starts trying WAY too hard to be an \u201cintelligent\u201d show, thanks to laughable plot points such as \u201cairport chess\u201d (playing a life-size game of chess with an airport as the board -_-). Some of these are so bad that they manage to create plot holes. This spiral is perpetuated by the introduction of a certain character that we\u2019ll get to later. \\n\\n\r\nThe train wreck is culminated in the disaster that was the finale of the show, which was incredibly rushed, anticlimactic, unsatisfying, and really just shockingly bad (that\u2019s right, I could write an entire essay on why that ending sucked, and yet everyone seemed to enjoy it). I think the biggest reason behind this failure is the fact that none of the mysteries have satisfactory answers behind them, or at least not any that are even remotely satisfying. The big revelation of the show is supposed to be the backstory of the characters, particularly their motivations, and quite frankly, it\u2019s all just so damn predictable. The names of the main characters (\u201cNine\u201d and \u201cTwelve\u201d) coupled with the OP are all you need to see to guess to the character\u2019s pasts (or at least the basic gist of it). Once you do that, its just a matter of figuring out their motivations, which are STUPID! It\u2019s not that the motivations themselves are terrible, it\u2019s that they render the entire storyline completely pointless because there are MILLIONS of other, better ways they could have gone about reaching their goals, but stealing plutonium and bombing shit was the idea they decided to go with? Whatever. In short, the plot absolutely crumbles. It\u2019s bad.\\n\\n\r\nIf the plot isn\u2019t where ZnT went wrong, then it was definitely in its characters. Our protagonists, Nine and Twelve, are shallow. We never learn anything substantial about the way they think or who they are. Sure, we learn their backstories, but that doesn\u2019t tell us anything about who they are as individuals. They seemed so promising and unique at first, but they ended up being boring, unspectacular, and not memorable at all. Lisa, the third wheel of the show, has no purpose. Why does she even exist? She is used as a misogynistic plot device in ONE episode, and then does nothing ever again. Even in the finale, when she finally had an opportunity to show that she affected the story or that the story affected her in SOME way, it just doesn\u2019t happen. The ending gets rushed through. So disappointing. Then there\u2019s Five: THE WORST ANIME ANTAGONIST IS RECENT MEMORY. FUCK FIVE. Everything good that the show had going for it gets wrecked or begins its downward spiral once this character showed up. Here\u2019s why: The show used to be morally grey; there were no clear good guys or bad guys because we didn\u2019t know why Sphinx was doing this. Then Five comes along, who is overly maniacal, blatantly evil, and stupidly exaggerated. This wrecks the notion of grey morality and makes it more black and white than a bad shounen would. The show used to have realism; many connections were made to real life, modern places and things that made the show believable. Then Five comes along, begins a game of airport chess (-_-), speaks the WORST engrish I\u2019ve ever heard in my entire life, and successfully manages to manipulate a major government organization at the age of about 17. Makes sense. I could go on, but I think you get the point. This cast of characters is very, very bad, particularly Five. The only character that is even remotely passable is Shibazaki, but he is relatively shallow as well.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Zankyou no Terror has reminded us all about a sad reality: shows that start well do not always end well. In fact, sometimes, they crash and burn. This would be an example of an anime that crashed and burned. I know the first few episodes are really good and really interesting, I know the animation is a fantastic complement to the show, and I know that music is incredible, but none of that can fix the shitstorm of a shallow, incompetent plot and uninteresting characters. Is it a bad anime? No. Is it worth watching? Meh, maybe. It\u2019s just overwhelmingly underwhelming, if that makes sense.",

            "content": "Terror in Resonance focuses on a duo of teen terrorists responsible for a string of bombings throughout Tokyo that have the police baffled over who the culprits are. Mostly focused on our young male leads Nine and Twelve, Terror in Resonance involves the duo using the codename Sphinx to give riddles out to the police in a challenge to have them figure out the location of their bombs before they detonate, leading detective Kenjiro Shibazaki to be involved in the case as only he has the wits and intellect among the police force to connect the dots on the actions and motives involving the bombingswith Sphinx. As the series progresses, a girl around Nine and Twelve's age named Lisa becomes entangled in their plans, more about their dark past is revealed and someone from their past arrives in Japan to attempt sabotaging their efforts.\\n\\n\r\nOn paper, the premise of Terror in Resonance seems like a typical one for a suspense title as elements to its storytelling such as the bombers playing a cat and mouse game with police, the so-called villains not being as evil as you think and government secrets are nothing new within anime. However, the somewhat realistic and dark mood that the series gives off in the exploration of Nine and Twelve's bombings give it something of a chilling feel as the events can hit close to home with American anime viewers of the series, especially in light of the events of the September 11 terrorist attacks.\\n\\n\r\nThe first four episodes are focused around Nine and Twelve's cat and mouse game with the police trying to figure out the whereabouts of their planted bombs via the video riddles that our two leads supply them. The episodes help to establish the characters of the duo and Shibazaki, as we learn of their backgrounds and what issues they are implied to have with their national government. Not to mention the suspense of seeing if either side will prevail in their goal in each episode is genuinely thrilling. Later episodes introduce us to a past acquaintance of Sphinx in the form of Five, accompanied by American agents, who complicates things for Sphinx as she is just as smart and crafty as the duo when she exploits their modus operandi to her advantage by turning the tables on them by playing her own cat and mouse games with the duo for the second third of the series. The final third of the series reveals everything going on with Sphinx, Five and the government secrets connected to them; as well as what plans Sphinx had with the plutonium they had stolen prior to the start of the series that build up to a rather bittersweet, yet satisfying, ending. For the most part, Terror in Resonance is effective at making use of the story elements it is rehashing by applying a more darker and realistic edge them and creating genuine suspense and intrigue out of what you think is going to happen next in the series.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I praise the show of its execution of its plot, it does carry some issues that hurt its quality to an extent involving some among its cast. Lisa's character is mostly worthless in the series as she mostly exists as a damsel-in-distress for Twelve to rescue and has no real relevance to the major events that take place throughout the series, which lead me to question why she exists in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nFive's character is a bit of a double-edged sword for her role in the series. While her presence in the series helps to create a solid adversary against Sphinx, the psychotic and childish fits she gives in to at points in the series do usually make it hard to take her as a serious threat and there are clear lapses in logic from the agents accompanying her as they don't try stopping her destructive and life-threatening actions. Unlike Nine and Twelve, Five doesn't get enough dimension and background to her character to make her sympathetic, especially when later episodes attempt to do so despite the earlier acts she shown where she had no regard for the lives she would put at risk in her cat and mouse game.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation-wise, Terror in Resonance is easily one of the best TV titles this year in what it implements for its visuals and soundtrack. The visuals make use of subdued color tones and plenty of detail for designing its lifelike, vast settings and have character designs that don't have the conventional anime style of rainbow-color hair and big eyes, having bodily features drawn as believably as possible. The animation is easily among the best I've seen for the year for a TV anime thus far, with plenty of onscreen fluid movement that shows people and vehicles moving naturally without degradation of animated detail or noticeable animation shortcuts. Highlights to the animation in the series include groups of people moving about in the streets of Tokyo, the collateral damage resulting from bomb attacks and the impressive looking events that take place in the finale of the series.\\n\\n\r\nFor the show's music, Yoko Kanno lends her music composure talents to the series creating tense and haunting dramatic pieces that are excellent fits to the dark and chilling mood regularly portrayed throughout Terror in Resonance's run. The opening and closing songs to the series (Trigger and Dare Ka, Umi o) are easily the best lyrical tracks for an anime series that I've heard for the year thus far as they are fitting for the mood of the series and immediately stick out to those viewing it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Terror in Resonance makes for a solid 11-episode run of suspense, mystery and intrigue concerning Sphinx's bombings and their origins, making effective use of rehashed story elements through giving them a more darker and realistic edge. It has its shortcomings with some elements to its storytelling and characterization, but it was still a thrilling watch for me to check out throughout its 11-episode run.",

            "content": "What do we think of when we hear the word \u2018terrorism\u2019? The first thought coming to mind would destruction and death. Terrorism isn\u2019t anything new though for the past few decades. A monumental event that took place on September 11, 2001 really stroke the foundation of this word. Taking a step back though, terrorism has always been around whether it involves domestic terrorism, bio-terrorism, or even cyber terrorism. Where does Zankyou no Terror fit into all this? Well, it all begins with an event that the world witnessed which has now become a global pandemonium.\r\nZankyou no Terror (Terror in Tokyo or Terror in Resonance) isa 1-cour show produced by studio MAPPA. The series is an original anime meaning there\u2019s no source material based off of the work. At the same time, it\u2019s noticeable that the show is directed by Shinichiro Watanabe while also reuniting with music producer Yoko Kanno. That alone should evoke some interest for this series. Taking by the standard, the show can be mind indulging. The setting takes place in Tokyo where an event dubbed as terrorism catches the attention of the world. There\u2019s no direct evidence to the true masterminds besides a video uploaded on the Internet. Going by the name of \u201cSphinx\u201d, viewers learn that the culprits are actually two teenage boys with a goal in mind and an ambition that strikes fear.\\n\\n\r\nAs a psychological thriller, the first episode wastes little time to establish the presence of the main characters. We meet Touji Hisami and Arata Kokonone who also seems to play the role of anti-heroes. However, they are better known by their designated numbers \u201c9\u201d and \u201c12\u201d respectively for unknown reasons. The series blasts off literally as they go through the plan to steal plutonium from a power plant. About half a year later, a government building is bombed as the duo creates fear and confusion in Tokyo. There\u2019s one problem though. A young girl named Lisa accidentally gets herself caught in the middle of this affair. Faced with a choice between life or death, she chooses to join them as an accomplice. From here, the show becomes a dangerous cat-and-mouse game or so it seems to be. I have to admit though, this series can quickly become confusing at first. A lot of events happen in the first few episodes where the viewers might not truly understand what\u2019s going on. What exactly is Sphinx? Why are they doing this? What do they want? These common questions pop up instantly as there\u2019s little clues to provide their purpose. However, the show undergoes phases to flesh out these answers with cryptic clues. \\n\\n\r\nAs cryptic as the show seems to be, there are a lot of references, influences, and allusions to cultural and literature. The clues that Sphinx provides to the public often alludes to famous works such as Oedipus Rex. At the same time, there\u2019s also something else noticeable about the two as their plan seemingly involves the engineering of recognition. Sure, they strike fear with what they are doing but their plans results in no death. There has been a few close calls but causalities aren\u2019t a result of what they are seemingly after. That strikes the curiosity of what they really want or if they really are the so-called villains the public makes them out to be. There is a big bad of the show though. We don\u2019t know much about her except her name as \u201cFive\u201d. It\u2019s hard to say how we can feel about the character as she treats the hunt for Nine and Twelfth as a game. Her twisted psyche implies that she came from the same place where Nine and Twelfth did when she was little as seen in various flashbacks. What makes her stand out more is the fact that she solely aims to accomplish a mission while playing with her opponents. It\u2019s also implied that she cares little for the lives of those involved as seen in one particular episode when she gets Lisa caught in a death trap. The relationship Five has with is perhaps most prominent during her conversation with Nine. She treats him as an opponent in her game and hopes to win by putting him in situations where lives really are at stake.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Nine, he also shares some interesting relationships with others. The most prominent is with Twelfth, his friend and accomplice. In a way, we may even see the duo as brothers because of their close bond. But over time throughout the show, there\u2019s a slow yet evident progress that seems to drive them a bit apart. This is seen by their contrasting personalities. Nine is a serious character with stoic expression and man of few words. On the other hand, Twelfth has more of a childish persona who often cracks jokes and make best of what they are doing. The relationship that Twelfth develops with Lisa is also fleshed out throughout the show after he saves her numerous times. In a way, Lisa is similar to Twelfth as both are lonely and tends to cause trouble around them. During one particular scene in the series, she pops a curious question to Twelfth asking him if he is planning to destroy the world. The response suggests that they don\u2019t really care about anything anymore but to do what they want. It\u2019s at this point in the show that viewers may realize the interpersonal relationships characters develop by their common interest. Unlike most series, they are ambiguous and can be interpreted in different ways. For another instance, Nine\u2019s connection with a detective named Kenjiro Shibazaki leads them both into a world of twists. Here, we enter a realm where the hunters may be the hunted but with understanding that comes from jeopardizing others to achieve goals.\\n\\n\r\nThe show can be interpreted in a detective-esque series as well although it lacks the forefront of storytelling by a first person point of view. With the cat-and-mouse game in place, we get several scenarios where detective Shibazaki comes close to catching Sphinx in particular Nine. At one interesting point, the two even work together because of a common goal. However, the way the suspense is delivered can be a mixed bag. The clues sometimes feels a bit simplistic, predictable (through foreshadowing), and sometimes even repetitive. Furthermore, we don\u2019t know much about the characters\u2019 backgrounds. We can only scratch on the surface to see what type of person they have become. Compared to their past, it\u2019s really hard to characterize them on an individual scale. However, there\u2019s decent suspense when it comes to conspiracy regarding VON (as shown in the beginning of the show). The mechanics behind the conspiracy is explained without confusing the audience and offers thorough guidance. As such, the show is aware of what it has been doing to transit each episode with its structure and delivering a well-crafted story. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s too intelligent as some bits are ambiguous such as Lisa/Twelfth\u2019s relationship. It\u2019s hard to say the significance of their relationship but ultimately is on track of the show\u2019s execution. \\n\\n\r\nAs a character coming into this new world, Lisa can also be quite a character for debate. We know that she isn\u2019t a popular girl, terrible at cooking, and in general a clumsy character who is often not sure of her place in this world. Her family background is most left in the dark but through several scenes, it\u2019s easy to see that it isn\u2019t exactly bright. The only character she is closed to is Twelfth. It\u2019s hard to say they are friends but rather as close acquaintances. Later on, it\u2019s easy to realize how much Twelfth dedicates himself to Lisa; a sharp contrast to when he threatened her life after becoming an acquaintance in the beginning. It\u2019s also implied that there\u2019s more to meet than the eye from where she came to the world as a child which sparks interest. However, her character can be somewhat controversial. Throughout the show, she also plays a bit of the \u2018damsel in distress\u2019 especially after the introduction of Five. I wouldn\u2019t call her a terrible character but some of her roles are underwhelming. Perhaps the show is trying to send a message of what someone\u2019s life feels like when they enter a completely different world. In this case, Lisa would be the normal character entering the Nine and Twelfth\u2019s abnormal world. She\u2019s not entirely useless either considering some of her actions did influence certain outcomes. However, she isn\u2019t the sharpest tool in a shed either.\\n\\n\r\nEven prior to the first episode, preview videos show that the anime has great potential on technical fronts. When it comes to visuals, this series deserves praise as it illustrates the realism of terrorism. Destruction such as a government building and aircraft highlights fear and tension. The spectacular artwork depicts the consequences of that with great precession. The characters\u2019 designs also have a feeling that makes you think they are outsiders. Nine and Twelfth and designed with simple characteristics to make them look normal. Five on the other hand has the look of a mischievous woman; a trait that fits her role accurately considering her hacking skills. Finally, there\u2019s Lisa and Shibazaki who are designed to look very human. In retrospect, MAPPA studio aced their production qualities with a bang. And even saying that figuratively, the short yet memorable moments of those explosions captures the world\u2019s attention.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack also plays a prominent role thanks to the talented Yoko Kanno. Her music score delivers the message of a solemn tune with deadly accuracy when it comes to depict a theme of isolation. The slow pacing of the soundtrack has a meaningful purpose with it\u2019s trying to portray. In particular, several scenes creates a brooding atmosphere that matches perfectly with the OST. The jazz tunes also commands attention to achieve its desired effect especially during climatic scenes. Finally, both the OP and ED songs creates the thriller-like vibe to give what the audience expects \u2013 a convincing tale of mind games.\\n\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror\u2019s premise and delivery ultimately prevails in the end despite some of its predictable plot points and pacing. What began as a terrorist plot transpires into mind games and relationship building that develops naturally. The show seizes opportunities to make the best of what it has and although it doesn\u2019t always deliver masterfully, it\u2019s well intentioned for its efforts. Characters have diverse range of personalities and motivations to create tension. If you\u2019re looking for an anime with impressive visuals and soundtrack as well, then you\u2019ll be in for a nice treat. In the end, Shinichiro\u2019s talents are realized once again in this show. For a thriller, this show definitely requires attention and patience. And in the end, it\u2019s worth every minute. \\n",

            "content": "Terror in Resonance is a fine anime in terms of directing and tension. It\u2019s not hard to see how it excited thousands of viewers into calling it anime of the year back when the first episode aired. That still doesn't make up for its undeniably amateurishly handled script when it comes to mystery stories. Personally, I didn't need to wait for the show to be over before I knew it wasn\u2019t as good as they were hyping it to be. The cracks were obvious since the very pilot and kept getting bigger with each new episode. The reason why everybody else didn\u2019t want to admitto that is because the director was Watanabe of Cowboy Bebop fame. There is no way for Watanabe to mess up, even if anything else he made besides Bebop was average. Well, damn, he did, what a shock. So for those of you who are in constant denial while hugging your huge anime pillows.\\n\r\nAllow me to give you some basic pointers, for as to why this anime was basically a waste of my time and why I regret watching it so much. \\n\r\n-The plot is basically, plot less:\\n\r\nIt starts out with a very intriguing idea about how two teenagers plan to create chaos in Japan by exploding a Government building, and then send out riddles for the police to solve in order to stop the bombs that they plant. Each time, the riddle is engrossed with a message. \\n\r\nHowever,\\n\r\nI could already predict what the rest of the show will be about after episode 3. I mean, really, it was obvious what the terrorists wanted to do thereafter. A good mystery story is revealing itself slowly, constantly keeping you interested to find out more. This anime didn\u2019t do that. It overused its already lazy exposition gimmicks to the point it revealed all the major plot points in its first quarter. All there was left was an almost fatalistic procedure because it became that predictable. And the only reason it took 11 episodes to play out exactly as I predicted was only because they wasted half the show running after Lisa or Five, characters whose role was to derail the plot and waste time.\\n\r\n-Everyone seems to act like a retard except that one cop.\\n\r\n-There doesn't seem to be real *terror* in the show.\\n\r\nTerrorism and human experiments, Ooooh! what a thrill!\\n\r\nI expect people crouching, crying and going insane. Thinking how it's going to be the end of the world, as the atomic bomb is going to explode.\\n\r\nLol, no.\\n\r\n-It seems like a very, very bad anime remake of V for vendetta but without the good dialogues, plot and characterization.\\n\r\n-The only reason I watched the whole show was because of the fantastic sound and animation, and that's it.\\n\r\n-Why is five even there? \\n\r\nThe story is disrupted when this psychotic bitch, five enters the scene. Where she doesn't capture nine and twelve, but chooses to play a game with them. Which btw is completely fine because the Americans are Muppets being controlled by her and choose to ignore every thing until one them points a gun at her and says that enough is enough. At which point, five kills him and then finally come face to face with nine. You would think that she wanted to say or do something interesting when she finally meets the man she has been chasing this whole time? RIGHT? RIGHT?\\n\r\nNooooooo, she just tells him that it was all a game and kills herself.\\n\r\nWait, what.\\n\r\nYes, EXACTLY.\\n\r\n- Does anybody even know about the experiments in the end? were the guilty parties even punished? We don't know. All we know that a bunch of buildings were bombed and two teenagers were killed. And most of the anime was spent rescuing a stupid bimbo called Lisa.\\n\r\n-This is not how real detectives do stuff they know how to do basic research and are not complete idiots who don't even know how to use wikipedia, furthermore when you look at a nuclear explosion, you don't hold hands and pretend as if they are fire works. Because there is a thing called radio-activity. And EMP pulses are enough to kill anyone who has a pacer in his heart or is in life support in hospitals, thus contradicting the attempt to not kill anyone.\\n\r\n- There is no political statement behind the bombings because the two terrorists do not reveal them until the show is over. They don\u2019t even have demands for not going forward with the bombings; a thing which no terrorist ever does. If there is a statement, there is no reason not to reveal it right away; something which of course they didn't because that way the show would end in 2 episodes.\\n\r\n- Where is the so called awakening of the population that I was promised in the synopsis of the show? Because all I remember is yawing through out the show and waiting for it to show the greatness it promised.\\n\r\n-Over all points:\\n\r\nStory:3/10\\n\r\nArt:9/10\\n\r\nSound:9/10\\n\r\nCharacter:3/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment:4/10\\n",

            "content": "Zankyou no Terror pricked up the ears of many anime fans when it was announced to be an original anime directed by Shinichiro Watanabe. Since Watanabe had previously directed widely acclaimed shows such as Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, and Kids on the Slope, Zankyou no Terror was naturally expected to be Watanabe\u2019s next big work. Couple that with the fact that Yoko Kanno, another big name in the anime industry, handled the soundtrack composition, and the show instantly became a fan favorite coming into the season. So then the question has to be asked: \u201cDoes Zankyou no Terror live up to its hype?\u201d \r\nMy answerwould have to be, \u201cnot really.\u201d In short, Zankyou no Terror is worthy of its praise for its impressive visuals and a phenomenal soundtrack, but those alone are not enough to cover up the lack of character development and the slightly problematic story.\\n\\n\r\nStory & Exposition\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror is about two mysterious teenagers, Nine and Twelve, who plan a series of terrorist bombings in Tokyo under the alias of \u201cSphinx.\u201d Much like the Sphinx from Greek Mythology, Nine and Twelve give out a riddle to the public before detonating each bomb. An ex-detective named Kenjiro Shibazaki is the only one in the Japanese police force that figures out the answers to the riddles, and he vows to bring \u201cSphinx\u201d to justice. Shibazaki, however, eventually realizes that Nine and Twelve have ulterior motives behind their terrorist bombings and figures out a disturbing truth. But before Shibazaki can process the truth, the Sphinx bombings come to a sudden stop as the FBI, led by an old friend of Nine and Twelve, intervenes and starts a wild cat-and-mouse chase to capture \u201cSphinx.\u201d A three-way battle between the Japanese police force, \u201cSphinx,\u201d and the FBI unfolds as they all try to carry out their own purposes. \\n\\n\r\nSince you are sort of thrown into the middle of this whole situation, watching Zankyou no Terror initially feels like playing a videogame without in-game tutorials: You have to learn everything there is to know about the anime as it goes on. The show will leave you plenty of hints throughout the series through flashbacks, cinematographic details, and dialogue, but in the end it is up to you to analyze those hints and figure out what is going on. Since most anime rely on \u201cinfo dumps\u201d to spoon-feed background information to the audience, Zankyou no Terror really stood out in the beginning for its engaging style of exposition. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with this style of exposition, however, is that there is a limit as to how much the show can tell the viewers without directly telling them. The more information the show holds from the audience, the harder it will be to explain everything towards the end. Unfortunately, this was the case for Zankyou no Terror, so even if the show tried to explain everything towards the end, it answered only the bare essentials of the questions raised by the show. Zankyou no Terror should have struck a balance between what they should tell the audience and what they should hold from the audience, but they decided to hold too much from the audience and paid the price of glossing over several questions that needed to be addressed. Although the show wraps up its story relatively well, there was a sense of incompleteness that left me dissatisfied in the end.\\n\\n\r\nStyle Over Substance?\\n\r\nWhen it comes to Watanabe, it\u2019s hard not to talk about his style. Without a doubt, Zankyou no Terror is Watanabe\u2019s directing at its finest, especially in terms of cinematography: Watanabe uses a lot of low-key lighting in order to convey a sense of despair and isolation, or in other cases a sense of mystery and suspense; he uses different camera panning techniques to give scenes 3D depth that makes them look dynamic; and of course, his love for the visual spectacle resulted in some of the most beautifully animated scenes to be seen in anime history. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Zankyou no Terror is the typical case of a show that emphasizes \"style over substance,\" in which the captivating style overwhelms the comparatively weak substance. There definitely was a deeper message and a darker story behind Zankyou no Terror, but the show just didn't do a good job of conveying that message and story. Most of the story\u2019s shortcomings and shallowness can be blamed on the length of the show, because a 1-cour was not enough to tell the story that Zankyou no Terror was trying to tell. The writers could definitely have planned it better, but what started out as a seemingly profound show about exploring the mindset of terrorists and discussing the corruption and degradation of a Japanese nation quickly became a blockbuster action thriller filled with clich\u00e9s and empty characters. The writers tried too hard to combine a dark social commentary with action thriller sequences that the show ended up as a confused mishmash that lost the original focus of the story. Zankyou no Terror should have focused more on being either a dark human drama or a pulse-pounding suspense drama, but not both.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters & Developments\\n\r\nWith the story trying to be two things at once and Watanabe focusing too much on his own style, the weakest aspect of Zankyou no Terror would undoubtedly be its characters. There just is not much to say about the characters because viewers never get an in-depth look into each character. At one point, viewers have to accept the fact that some characters are just plot devices in order for the story to meet a certain end. The characters definitely had the potential to drive the story in a better direction, but the characters are instead sacrificed in order for the story to finish strong. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, it is not like the characters get no development at all. The show actually makes subtle attempts to try and develop its characters, and so if the viewers are willing to invest themselves enough to the show, they will indeed be able to find redeeming qualities within the characters. However, for most viewers the characters do not get developed enough for them to care. And without the emotional connection between the viewers and the characters, viewers cannot look beyond the dull and stereotypical personas to find the characters likable or relatable. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a real shame considering that the characters were actually interesting. Looking at it strictly from the characters\u2019 perspectives, the story revolves around five social outcasts who each want to make something of their aimless lives and do something right for themselves. Seeing each of them struggle in his or her own way to carry out individual goals is actually both heartbreaking and heartwarming to watch. However, the show, again, never capitalizes on the emotional development of these characters, and thus the inner conflicts of the protagonists become largely overlooked. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Realism\\n\r\nA rather unique aspect about this show is its sense of realism. Since the setting is in an alternative version of modern Japan, it is difficult for viewers to suspend their disbelief because the show makes everything seem so realistic and believable. For example, it is clear that the writers did their research in terms of how bombs are made, how hackers invade the system, and how the police would react to terrorist attacks. Not only that, the show throws in all these real life references, like YouTube videos, Puzzles & Dragons, Twitter tweets, and Bitcoins to further emphasize the show\u2019s realism.\\n\\n\r\nThe realism can be seen in the character designs as well. For example, the show contains a lot of close-ups on the characters\u2019 faces, so the facial features are detailed and well proportioned. The characters as a whole are given normal human appearances, but are still distinct from one another because of their facial and bodily features. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the animation, the show stomps its competition by a long shot. Although there was a quality drop towards the end of the show, the animation overall was smooth, detailed, and beautifully done. Briefly mentioned above, Watanabe\u2019s choices in cinematography is really what made the animation stand out even more and resulted in visually stunning scenes that are hard to come by in anime.\\n\\n\r\nKanno & Soundtrack\\n\r\nUsually, the soundtrack is my least favorite part to review because there are only so many ways of saying that the soundtrack \u201cenhances the mood or atmosphere of certain scenes in the anime.\u201d I mean, which soundtrack doesn\u2019t? Zankyou no Terror\u2019s soundtrack, however, gives me something to write about. For one thing, the soundtrack is categorically indie, filled with several experimental songs that combine electronic, classical, and ambient sounds together with (or without) vocals in Japanese, English, or Icelandic. Yoko Kanno shows off her musical prowess once more and proves that she is not afraid to experiment with different styles of music in order to make a soundtrack appropriate for Zankyou no Terror. The soundtrack, therefore, is terrific. What makes it more than just an excellent soundtrack, however, is that it becomes better when complemented by the anime. Partly due to the cinematic quality of Zankyou no Terror, every scene in which a song is playing in the background looks and feels like a music video. In other words, the emotions evoked from the scenes mesh beautifully with the melody of the songs, thus making Zankyou no Terror\u2019s soundtrack an essential part in enjoying this anime to its fullest.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict\\n\r\nWatch Zankyou no Terror at your own risk. The realistic art and the remarkable music are enough to blow you away, but the problematic story and dull characters will reasonably disappoint you. Watch this show as you would any other show by lowering your expectations, and only then will you find that Zankyou no Terror is one of the better ones, especially among original anime, to come out in awhile.\\n\\n\r\n*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nMusic: 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n*^*^*^*^*^*^*^*^\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n(Edit: I decided to weigh the \"story and character\" more (60%) and \"art, music, and enjoyment\" less (40%).

            "content": "And thus, what is easily one of the most politically charged anime in recent memory has come to a close. People are primarily attracted to it for its value as a piece of visual entertainment, but is that all there is to works such as this? \r\nThus in my determination to explicate on the matter as thoroughly as possible, I would like to present to you with my POFITs on the anime Zankyou no Terror, or as it is in English, 'Terror in Resonance'.\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nTo begin with, allow me to present my case for what is most definitely the primary objective behind this particular anime's conception.\r\nForone, this anime, though it utilizes plot elements from a multitude of genres in fiction such as the thriller, psychological and police procedural genres, it is in reality much more akin in spirit to that of satires (albeit a very dry and analytical one utilizing extensive irony, analogy and juxtaposition), social commentaries and political fiction.\\n\\n\r\nThe heavy usage of highly subtle and somewhat in-your-face symbolism that are intimately connected to events that had occurred outside of fiction, in addition to explicit references to key events in real world history is indicative of the overall direction that this anime is taking, and on what themes, ideas and messages that it attempts to convey to the general public.\\n\\n\r\nAnd because of that, whoever was in charge of conceiving such ideas and putting them onto the screen is personally expounding his or her views within the permissible scope of free speech. Which in this case, revolves around the increasingly dangerous and alarming resurgence of Japanese ultra-nationalism, as well as the current ongoing debate regarding the proposed amendments to Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution. Other subtle critiques against the current state of Japanese societal affairs include, but are not limited to the increasing political apathy among the Japanese, as well as the increasingly alarming state of interpersonal relationships within the Japanese population.\\n\\n\r\nNow, were those symbols and references used to maximum effect? Yes and no, as their placement and timing is at times too subtle or multi-layered that it tends to make the audience lose track of or interest in them amid the very fast, though expertly paced plot sequences; no scene drags, and no scene ever feels too fast. \\n\\n\r\nAs to the actual plot itself, it is relatively straightforward and very dense though halfway on, the plot takes on a rather chaotic turn as new plot elements and characters are introduced, though only momentarily before returning to a somewhat more stable state of affairs before the climax. The 'lull' so to speak. But is all of this 'completely original'? Not really, and at times not exactly necessary either. Especially in regards to the themes, a far more elaborate and metaphorical take on the plot would greatly lessen the impact of the message itself.\\n\\n\r\n{EDIT}\\n\\n\r\nA note on the script-writing pertaining to the story as a whole, I have made re-assessments in regards to certain plot points and thematic concepts, and I have concluded that they were unsatisfactorily handled, i.e., that they were either stretching the limits of believability or simply not explored thoroughly enough, in that ideas were merely referenced rather than expounded upon via a variety of means to properly convey the sheer gravity and scale of the series' themes. \\n\\n\r\nIndeed, perhaps one of the key expectations that numerous people have when they think of the show, is that it possesses a certain 'je ne sais quoi', a certain 'revolutionary seriousness' or 'zeitgeist quality' to it which demands that it be taken very seriously, whereby the very fact that it possesses this very element signifies a 'do or die' expectation from the audience. Thus, notwithstanding the slightest inconsistency in logic, or it not being bold, challenging or transgressive enough, the show's very nature, now weighed down by the 'just not quite there yet' execution in its thoroughness, is probably the biggest reason why despairing disappointment, is all too prevalent.\\n\\n\r\nStory Rating: 7\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nWhen I speak of the artistic qualities of the anime, I would like to say that this is easily one of the best animated animes in recent years. There are few still shots, and whatever still shots there are are expertly crafted to represent as close as possible to the essence of what it means to be in Japan during summer. One particular still shot that stood out, especially to me as I've experienced being in Japan before, is the still shot that depicts a school hallway in the summer daytime. Absolutely stunning and near realistic, reminds me very much of my own experience.\\n\\n\r\nNo scene feels lifeless, and no scene is in lacking of much needed detail. The extensive use of cinematographic elements in this anime adds value to certain scenes by heightening their suggested emotional or physical impact. The 3D animation used in this anime in relation to certain objects as well as background extras are impeccable, and blend extremely well with the 2D drawings. Particle effects, lighting effects, the fluid movements of objects and people, the extreme attention to all these elements can be summarized in one word: meticulous. The same goes for the symbolism and references as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt Rating: 10\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound-based elements in the anime, the characters are well-voiced, lending credibility to the emotions displayed on screen. Miscellaneous sound effects such as gun shots, explosions, object movement, footsteps and the like are very well done and do not sound in any way cut and paste. \\n\\n\r\nThere has been debate in regards to the depiction of the English language used in some scenes, and overall, I would like to say that it is rather adequate though still underwhelming. One secondary character and one side character in particular are noted for their bad English pronunciation as well as their surprisingly good English pronunciation respectively in accordance to their characterization.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the background music and soundtrack, they are excellent. The soundtrack has enough variety and flair to facilitate the overall mood and tone of their respective scenes. If I can remember correctly, there are set piano pieces to set a tone of calm, set guitar riffs to heighten tension as well as a myriad of songs used throughout to provide symbolic meaning, which are mostly in English or even Icelandic. \\n\\n\r\nA little trivia is that all pieces used in the soundtrack are natively composed in Iceland to provide a degree of authenticity to some of the sounds, and that the anime itself also makes references to Icelandic music when pertaining to one main character's musical tastes.\\n\\n\r\nSound Rating: 8\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nAlright, characters..... Unfortunately, I would have to make certain comments in regards to the characterization of characters in this anime. For the most part, the characters are simple, rather 'tropey' characters. In fact, at certain points throughout the anime, one would see that the characterization of the main characters, as well as some secondary characters are a bit lacking and leaves one questioning as to whether they have much or any purpose within the overall plot, and one would also question as to whether the utilization of such characters or their assigned characteristics is even effective in advancing the plot or in helping to ease the conceptualization of the themes.\\n\\n\r\nThat said however, despite the characters embodying very specific 'Jungian archetypes' so to speak, they still do receive further development in their overall personalities, it's just that due to the very short runtime of the series, their identities are simply not developed to their fullest potential.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Rating: 6\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nStrictly speaking, the visual entertainment medium, in fact, all entertainment are primarily created for profit-seeking enterprises as well as entertainment and artistic merit and prestige. Sometimes however, works such as this emerge that immediately warrants not an evaluation of whether one was able to derive 'pleasure' from it, but whether one was able to appreciate and ponder on its messages, themes and whether its artistic elements helped one come closer to a better understanding of them, or of life itself. At times, the best fiction, and even the best works of art and music aren't for enjoyment's sake but are attempts at better conceptualizing and clarifying what is known as 'worldly truth' depending on their scope of exploration.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for that, this show does it relatively rather well.\\n\\n\r\nAppreciation Rating: 8 \\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would like to conclude my review on the anime Zankyou no Terror by offering both a 'Recommended Viewing' and 'Socially Important' approval seals to it despite areas of unsatisfactory development, in addition to providing total aggregate scores of:\\n\\n\r\n[9 For Personal Rating]\\n\\n\r\nAnd\\n\\n\r\n[8 For Critical Rating]\\n\\n\r\nI bid all of you farewell, till next time then.\\n\\n\r\n{NISHIZAWA APPROVED}\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\n(P.S. If you happen to want some music recommendations since this anime makes active use of music composed in Iceland, then I would like to point you to the Icelandic artists Bjork and Sigur Ros. And yeah, Sigur Ros's first album is titled Von as well)",

            "content": "Feelings of wanting to destroy society and all of its riches in order to reconstruct to their own ideologies have been the forefront of terrorist actions. Lately, the beginning of the 21st Century has cropped up numerous terrorist acts across the globe. So, what better way of showcasing these horrific acts of violence then to make an anime where the terrorists are the protagonists? With Cowboy Bebop director Shinchiro Watanabe at the helm of production in Terror in Resonance, this was sure to be a fiery sensation like many of his previous works. Yet, in spite of the hype, it turns out to be aprime example of how not every show with a talented director will be a marvelous project.\\n\\n\r\nSaying this is an abject failure, however, would be stretching it too far. It can be construed as a pretty good thriller in comparison to most recent anime thrillers that have come out. What Watanabe clearly knows what to do in his direction is to create a tone that is impending to the viewer. Whether it's comical like in his earlier works, or serious like in Kids on the Slope and Terror in Resonance. With the latter, we feel an intense, unsettling atmosphere directed by the three protagonists that we're following. Cold and calculated, they know how to create chaos in a just society and we can feel that anguish and thought process quite clearly and with great direction.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is one that speaks with radiance and greatness, accomplished once again by the always talented Yoko Kanno. Blending various styles of electronic music composition and dark string instruments, Kanno helps add so much layered atmosphere to the show. This and Watanabe's dark direction create a nice mixer that feels very cohesive to the structure of the environments we see in many scenes throughout Terror in Resonance.\\n\\n\r\nNot often do you see artwork on character designs to look more human than in typical anime. Terror in Resonance's artwork consists of beautifully drawn backgrounds with a nice coat of colors that give a dreary focal point to the setting. Washed out colors that have dark blue overtones are paved, even in scenes where there is daylight. Sometimes, in a small nit pick I'll admit, the darkness can be a little bit too much, to the point where it is difficult to see. Especially in the scenes where we visit the apartment rooms and there is hardly any light and I can barely see the characters in front of the camera's view.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Terror in Resonance marvels in is technicality. Other than those aspects, Terror in Resonance is lackluster in the aspects of story and character development. For starters, the vast majority of the characters in the show feel very vapid in terms of their characterization and personality. The only exception is Lisa Mishma because of her internal struggles that feel very genuine and relatable in her anxieties and psychological issues. Outside of her character, the two people she brought herself into, named Nine and Twelve, aren't as strong as her. Nine especially is inexcusably dull from what his goals are to begin with, which I'll get to later on, and his overall arc. Twelve is at least a little bit more enthralling because of his charming charisma, but considering how the show wants to be a dark psychological thriller, it feels a little out of place in some areas.\\n\\n\r\nBesides our three main leads, other characters come off as just decent, but nothing more memorable than that. Though I will say, Five is definitely a contender for villain of 2014 because of how they successfully make her into a big considerable threat. The police terrorism division head, Kenjirou Shibazaki, is a nice throwback to old-school crime detectives who are the main driving force in stopping the opposition. Although they aren't the very least bit memorable from the lack of any special identity, other than the fact that they are just there to stop the protagonists' bombings.\\n\\n\r\nNow we get to the story portion of the critique. This can easily be summed in a few main crutches that make it good: Lack of a coherent structure and poor development. All of this can pointed to the backstory of Nine, Twelve, and Five, which feels absolutely uninspired. Yes, it's your typical \"kids escape from a facility of a brainwashed government facility and go their separate ways\" plot. That isn't to say that it can't ever be done well, but with Terror in Resonance, it was lacking a special pull for me to even be interested in this type of plot again. Uninspired is the perfect word to describe the plot, with Watanabe on board on a project like this, you'd expect something more ambitious than this.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, was this a great thrill ride despite all that is said about the plot issues? Absolutely. The tension I get whenever the police are trying to find the bombs that Nine and Twelve put out in the city are some of the most intense sequences I've experienced yet. Again, with Watanabe's great direction, the atmosphere definitely helps make this work tremendously. With that and Kanno's extravagant music makes for a perfect amalgamation with all these elements neatly wrapped into a triumph for a suspenseful thriller.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some aspects that disappointed me to some regard, considering this is Watanabe's first directed show in nearly five years. That aside, I can still see this as worthwhile to watch. This will most likely be his least popular work, considering how Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo are typically looked at by everyone. But trying to best out his other works would be an impossible feat to take over; probably even for Watanabe himself.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B-",

            "content": "\"Zankyou no Terror\" is a terrifying thriller that will resonate with your soul.\r\nI don't know what expectations I had for this anime, but it sure exceeded any thoughts about it swirling around in my mind.\r\n\"Zankyou no Terror\" is a story about two odd teenage boys, Nine and Twelve.  As terrorists, they go by the name of \"Sphinx,\" uploading videos to tell where the next attack will be. The police are powerless to stop these children -- who shouldn't even exist -- from pulling the trigger on this world.\r\nThe three main voice actors of this series open the audience to a whole new world ofdesperation, solitude, and hope. Ishikawa, Kaito plays the brilliant, but shut off Nine, a genius hacker and brilliant mastermind (also played Harutora [Tokyo Ravens]). Ishikawa takes Nine's sadistic, yet kind and insecure personality and molds a new voice for this character. The voice is deep and silky like velvet, but hides a certain weakness under the dark tones. Likewise, Saito, Soma takes Twelve's character and does his own this with it, bringing the street smart, energetic boy to life (also played Tatsumi [Akame ga Kill!]). It reminds one of a dark and twisted Nagisa (Free!!), but holds more depth than that. The boys' accomplice, Mishima, Lisa, was voiced by Tanezaki, Atsumi who did a wonderful portrayal of a young, lonely girl with deep insecurities (also played Natsume, Asako [Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun]). She has a sweet, timid voice that makes this otherwise unappealing girl quite charming.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was definitely my favorite this season. I'm constantly on the lookout for a good psychological thriller. I was not left down. It all started with the opening song that just screamed 'love me!' And as ordered, I fell in love. Not only did it seem to have a good base for a great storyline, but it was intriguing from just the art alone. This is the first time I had ever seen such detailed, and realistic animation -- the first time characters actually looked Japanese. And it just gets better. The music was truly the best of this season. There is a segment in the anime where Nine has a nightmare, and I say others should take notes, because that is how a nightmare should look and sound.  It was a chaotic dream sequence with vague images telling a background story, accompanied by eerie music that further accentuated the dream-like state(lolol - OST).  Dreams are chaotic, and most have no one speaking -- there may be mouthing, but no words come out. However, even though you cannot hear the words, you know what the other person is saying. And that is how a nightmare should go. Another part I felt was executed correctly was the pacing. I don't think any pacing was a bit off in this anime the transitions were smooth, Twelve's and Nine's motives were slowly unveiled, and there were no characters introduced last minute. There was only one thing that bothered me: a character named Five. She was severely detrimental to the boys' plans. And maybe this is me hating on the character, but I felt that her existence affected the anime greatly, in a slightly negative way. But it happened, and now that it's over, I am not complaining. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a constant message being played throughout \"Zankyou no Terror\"; Von. It is of Icelandic origin, and most of the OSTs are sung in this language, making them sound like a piece of Bj\u00f6rk's. The constant message of 'Von' means 'Hope.' Twelve and Nine are trying to remind themselves --and others -- of hope. I feel that all the subliminal messages in this anime are very deep; enough to make one cry.\\n\\n\r\nNow this anime, like all psychological thrillers, is for the discerning of mind. There are a lot of mental games, and if you enjoy figuring those out and playing along, you will enjoy this anime. For those who like animes with a deeper meaning, this one is also for you. However, if you are the type to like fluffy shoujo stories, I suggest you give this a chance, but you might not like it. All I can say is that this is the first time I've ever truly been satisfied with an anime that only ran for eleven episodes. It was a short ride, but a memorable one.\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\r\nFrom the beginning, the base plot was perfectly mapped out with a pretty accurate summary of what the show might be like. As the story continued more characters were introduced -- all with the purpose of helping the storyline. Even having been annoyed by one (Five), she was not detrimental to the plot in the long run.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nWhile it may look rather plain, the artwork is really THE best ALL season. The characters actually look Japanese, not to mention very realistic. So much detail went into the characters from their waving hair to the subtle qualities in their eyes, to each expression and mannerism. \\n\\n\r\nMusic - 10\\n\r\nLike the art, the music had to be the best of the season. I don't give many tens for music, but this anime deserved it. First it was the opening that gripped me by the shoulders, invoking the emotions of suspense, yearning, and fear. All the OSTs were beautiful were a melodic tune that captured the thrilling and mysterious essence of the show. And to close it off was the ending; a surreal piece that excited me, but was very bloodthirsty, if not a bit desperate.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nThe character establishment was perfect. Twelve and Nine are introduced in the most uncanny way, as well as Lisa. Lisa's past and disappointing present are given in the first episode, and clarified upon throughout the series. Then the show moves onto the boys' pasts, taking a slight detour for detective Shibazaki who is working on the 'Sphinx' case. Then Five appears, making me question the show for a bit, but my worries were resolved in a wonderful, if not in a heartbreaking fashion. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\n\"Zankyou no Terror\" started with no place on my 'hype list,' and ended with the top slot. I love this show a lot, and am probably not going to find another like it for a long time. But that's fine. It is finding these gems that make watching anime so worth my while. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9.6\\n\r\nOverall, I very much enjoyed this anime with only one moment of doubt (a first for me!). It has all the elements I need in a perfect story; fitting music, subliminal messages, well rounded characters, great art, and an intriguing storyline. I am confident enough to say that this anime deserves only scores above eight, and it is well worth the watch.",

            "content": "Yet another over-hyped anime that started off the season and just like Attack on Titan, it became a train-wreck as well. Let me make this perfectly clear from the very beginning: this show is all style and no substance. Whatever deep sociopolitical message is ingrained here is hardly ever explored; the show would rather focus on fancy explosions and cool-sounding themes that don't even matter in the end. With that out of the way, I'll start the review.\r\nStory (25%) - 3/10\r\nMy reason for giving it such a low score is the fact that the riddles feel so pointless. And this is a big deal sinceabout 8 of the episodes focus on them. I keep asking myself: what was the point of those riddles?; why didn't they use the bomb from episode 1?; why didn't they reveal their motive for the bombings from the very beginning?; why didn't anyone go blind after staring at a nuclear explosion? So many questions.... And of course, all the fanboys are over-thinking the show to death with all their BS about how the show is such a deep social commentary on Japan, despite the fact that the show barely spared an episode to mention all that, instead focusing on pointless explosions and riddles. I can do it too, you know:\\n\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror is actually a show about how Japan refuses to learn from its past mistakes, just like how ZnT refuses to learn from the mistakes of Death Note and Code Geass. How? By adding another one-dimensional, white-haired antagonist to ruin the show and MORE BULLS*** CHESS.\\n\\n\r\nArt (20%) - 8/10\\n\r\nDefinitely some of the most realistic looking backgrounds and effects I've seen in anime. The directing is superb, better than most action flicks, and the explosions aren't cartoony. The animation is spectacular and it felt almost like a live-action movie at times. The character designs are what prevent a 10. As I was watching the show, the two main leads kinda reminded me of the characters in Free! The designs just don't seem very original and they don't stand out from other anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound (20%) - 8/10\\n\r\nNot as good as Bebop's soundtrack but still excellent. The OP however, didn't leave much of an impact. Not much else to say, definitely some of Yoko Kanno's best work.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (25%) - 3/10\\n\r\nNone of the characters in the show are relatable, making it hard to identify with any of them. Nine and Twelve really aren't interesting as characters; after their backstories were revealed, I felt sorry for them but also found them rather dull. Lisa was even more useless than Sakura from Naruto (if that's possible) and Five wasn't interesting in the least bit. Shibazaki was interesting and he was certainly the most humane character but he doesn't get much screen time or development and he is reduced to nothing but a plot device in the end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10%) - 7/10\\n\r\nIt may be a bad show but it has great art and sound. If you're only in it for the explosions and to be given infodumps by random people about the oh so interesting plot instead of being given something to think about, then you'll enjoy this. But don't expect a good thriller anime, this show is pretentious and has no message to offer that it doesn't outright tell you.",

            "content": "\"I started watching this really good anime; it's about terrorists.\" my cousin told me the one day. I was a bit startled by her statement and didn't expect that I'd like 'Zankyou no Terror' this much! *updated*\r\nSTORY (8/10): Knowing that this anime would be about terrorists, I was quite skeptical about what the plot would be like. I figured it would mainly be based on crazy action scenes and undeveloped characters but, boy, was I wrong! It turned out being completely different than I expected, and in a good way. The anime always had me guessing. Rather than pouring all of this overwhelming information ontoyou, it reveals things little by little, making the audience think about it and come up with theories about the characters' goals. I was not bored at all and was immediately pulled in from the moment I started watching! \\n\\n\\n\r\nART (8/10): 'Terror in Resonance' has some astounding art that really caught my eye and was a big factor in keeping my attention. It had a very clean-cut, yet elegant style. I love, love, LOVE the dramatic colors, lighting, and effects that were used, as well. It really helped set the mood for each scene and the show as a whole. From the delicately outlined animation, to the vivid city streets at night, the visuals never ceased to amaze me.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (10/10): Okay, so when my cousin showed me a small scene from the anime before I started watching it, I was struck by the music right away! I don't know how many times I've told her how much I love the music from this anime. The music is by Yoko Kanno, one of my favorite composers who also did the music in 'Wolf's Rain', 'Cowboy Bebop', and more. The soundtrack includes the help from musicians from different parts of the world, which shows that a lot of work was put into it. All of the different vocals are soft and calm, to match with the instrumentals. The opening is one of my favorites mostly because of the music. Aside from the soundtrack, the voice acting was spectacular. Each of the characters' voices were very mellow and pleasing to the ear. The emotion in their voices were very believable!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (9/10): This is one of the things I was worried about before watching this show. I was afraid that the characters would be underdeveloped and that it would be mostly focused on the action, but each episode seemed to develop the characters very well and made me really care about them. Before starting each episode I was excited to know more about them and see what would happen to them. The fact that they are terrorists made me wonder if I would be on their side, but the way that they were portrayed made me want to know more about them and hope for a happy ending for them. Anyway, the characters are realistic, understandable, and play a big part in the uniqueness of the anime. Most people wouldn't think to view it from their side of the story.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (9/10): Because it was so entertaining, creative, and very well put together, I give the enjoyment a 9/10. Some parts were a little confusing before it revealed things, but it was never too much to handle. When a new episode would come out, my cousin and I would be really excited, but also scared, because we didn't know what would happen to the characters. It's an emotional roller coaster, but an enjoyable one!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (10/10): 'Zankyou no Terror' is very different from most animes in which it focuses on a point-of-view that most would not think to see. I like it when you can see from a non-cliche perspective that questions views of society. The anime definitely exceeded my expectations and is probably one of the best that I've seen in a while. I enjoyed every minute of it and I loved the characters. It was artistically done by very talented people and a talented director. To me, this anime was a masterpiece. If you like a unique way of story-telling and a mind-capturing plot, then this is a must-see. However, if you are sensitive about things such as bombings and terrorism, you might not want to watch this. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants something new.",

The quality is also consistent.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nWhile a lot of people like the OP of this anime, i don't. My tastes in music is pretty different from other people. But the ED is good. Background music is spectacular and adds tension in serious situations, and makes you feel sad in some.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThe characters of ZnK is good. Exepct from Lisa, which is your generic \"damsel in distress\", We got Nine and Twelve, a team of two person with interesting personality and mysterious motives. Five is also introduced later in the series, and her personality is interesting and likeable. But the star of the show is Shibazaki, a cop, who gets a lot of character development throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nZnK always keeps me at the edge of my seat every episode, and keep me waiting for the next. Watching it is like watching a movie splitted into 11 parts. I almost cried in the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an anime that's unique and different, or has good plot, animation. watch Zankyou no Terror. It's totally worth your time.",

            "content": "This is a spoiler free review.\r\nZankyou No Terror has a very intriguing idea which first drove me to watch this. The idea of the main characters being terrorists really appealed to me, as it is something that hasn\u2019t really been touched on at all. I decided then to give this anime a go and for the first 4 episodes I was not disappointed.\r\nThe Artwork and Sound are good without being amazing I thought, although the use of English language in this anime is terrible. The opening episodes have us seeing how the terrorists are committing these crimes. They leave riddles to the police to tryand find bombs that they have placed, making the first half of this anime a cat and mouse game. Up to this point I was very happy with this anime and was very interested to see where it would take me, from episode 4 new characters are introduced and there is a plot twist that certainly dimmed my enjoyment.\\n\r\nThe plot twist turns the characters around and the anime drops its terrorism theme until the last episode, which disappointed me greatly. A female (or actually two) character is introduced and focused on heavily in the last half of the anime, these bring in romantic elements. I really didn\u2019t like the switch since I hadn\u2019t seen enough development of the characters for me to believe in the second half of the story. The character development is really bad in this anime, the pacing is bad too. I didn\u2019t like the depth of the characters either, the main female probably had the most of this but her character was really bland for me. The main reason why I couldn\u2019t accept the last half was due to the fact that I couldn\u2019t empathise with the characters because things were moving too fast and not being explained enough. I got why the characters were doing what they were doing, but these were shown in small flashbacks and never expanded on, I got it but I wasn\u2019t convinced.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10- pacing is bad and character development is minimal. Plot twists are uninspiring\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10- Nothing bad, Nothing amazing\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10- horrible use of English language loses the points here(why do they never get a Seiyuu that can actually speak English?)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 5/10- Main characters are interesting but have no depth.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10- First half is great. Second half is very disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nI decided to give this a 5/10 because it has a good premise and is a solid anime, but I was disappointed since I thought it could have been a lot better with an interesting theme. If you are watching this for the terrorism theme then I\u2019d say you will be disappointed, however, if you\u2019re looking to fill your time with something this could satisfy you.",

            "content": "First review so be easy.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is beautifully melancholic. Hear me out. Two boys who have obviously suffered a great deal of hardship, bring forth riddles and destruction. Why? Well you'll find out. However you know right off the bat that they're not exactly bad people. From the first episode you notice that everything was planned so that nobody dies. What could this mean for the characters and their motives? \r\nThe conclusion- although bitter- felt right and ended the show on a realistic note. Just a warning, if you're looking for a sunshine and rainbows kind of story, this is probably going to break you.\r\nArt:\r\nTheart style was nice and i really don't have any complaints other than the fact that some scenes were quite dark, but that's really just a nit-pick.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nThis music is so fantastic and beautiful, if nothing else, watch the show for the music. You're doing yourself a disservice if you don't at least listen to the music. Honestly trying to explain how great this soundtrack is, is like trying to fit the sky into a bottle. You just can't do it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe show is only 11 episodes long, so it's not surprising that we don't get a great deal of development. \\n\\n\r\nNine is quite mature and cold like ice. He's the leader of the two, and is generally portrayed as mildly bitter. The way he conducts himself is calm and calculated. His intelligence is definitely not something to laugh at.\\n\\n\r\nTwelve on the other hand is quite cheeky and mischievous. Although he acts as a polar opposite to nine, don't assume he's not as cunning and intelligent. Twelve is also more willing to \"befriend\" people.\\n\\n\r\nLastly Lisa. Gee all i can really say is poor baby. She's bullied, has an over-protective mother and the show doesn't seem to want to give her a break. She's pretty much tired and done with the world.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI loved it, end of story. These days, too many shows give heinous endings and plot twists, just for the sake of a \"happy ending\". I loved the characters, the music and animation. The emotion and tones were realistic and show that in reality, sometimes you don't always win.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a good story, this should definitely satisfy. From clever riddles to astounding music, this show is a definite source of food for thought.",

            "content": "When I saw that Shinihiro Watanabe was attached to this project, my expectations for this series were that it would contain a fair amount of substance, and a narrative that contains some complex but intriguing characters. And obviously it goes without saying that the series must have a impressive soundtrack, and I found that, for the most part, this series lived up to my expectations.\r\nThis anime tells the story of the terrorist organization known as Sphinx, and its two young members Nine and Twelve who make Tokyo their own personal game of dominoes through the use of explosives. Right away the series is shrouded inmystery as little is revealed about the two main characters and their motives, and they prove themselves as being more than worthy opponents for the police. They manage to \"recruit\" a new member the klutzy Lisa who is desperate to escape from her troubled home life and the bullies that surround her at school. The story manages to suck you in with its stylized action and the large amount of unanswered questions, but unfortunately some of the more pressing or engaging questions remain unanswered after all is said is done. Perhaps what is most interesting about the series is the fact as the series grows and the motives of the main characters comes to light, it becomes harder to pin who is the terrorist and has harmed society in their situation. Rather it seems more appropriate to say that the series offers a lesson on how much you sacrifice in order to re-cement yourself, or to find answers. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters of the series lack names, but still are interesting to watch as the viewer slowly learns more about them and their past. Both of them are quite smart, but 12 is much more childish and fun loving than his bespectacled counterpart. 9 is much more serious and is clearly the adult of the pair. The characters themselves stay rather static, but the real treat is being to interpret their actions as you gain more insight into the past of Sphinx as they send their message out one building at a time. Lisa is their tag along, and she starts off the series pretty depressing, but as she grows closer to Sphinx in 12 it offers more about both their characters and her moe element adds some funny and lighthearted moments to the series, but for the most part she just manages to get in everyone's way. Shibazaki is the former ace detective that becomes the polices' only answer to Sphinx, which is a tad it cliche, but Shibazaki is an interesting character to watch who has a strongly ingrained moral compass. Here is where  some cliche moments from a mystery film come to light, such as finding the answer to a puzzle to by having the fat funny guy inadvertently solve it. However the puzzles are still engaging, most of which are taken from classic Greek or Roman mythology/history for all the history geeks out there. Lastly their is the main antagonist of sorts 5, who acts very much like a comic book villain for my tastes, but honestly is still fun to watch even feels a tad stale and goes out with more of a fizzle.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art of this series is also incredibly well done, and also brings to mind the same style used in Psycho-Pass, at one point I thought I was watching psycho pass after staring at the pasty white skin of the characters for so long. The music is also fantastic and is able to heighten the feel of both emotional and action scenes. Also the scenes depicted in the series was under great scrutiny, as it appears there was a clear vision when planning out the scenes and certain shots. All in all the series offers some great entertainment and a compelling mystery despite its short run time, and I commend the creators for tackling such a controversial topic with such a superb piece of art.\\n",

            "content": "Before I start, let's take a look at the current score(s) of this show and what it achieved here on MAL:\r\nOver 75% of the viewers gave it a score of 8 or higher and it's currently ranked #186 in total.\r\nBut are such scores actually the proper scores for this show? Let's break it down:\r\nStory and its flaws mixed with a bit of rationality:\r\nWhile it did indeed have its moments, it failed horribly on quite some levels (for example, the motorbike scene was 10/10 material but that was, unfortunate as it is, probably the best scene this show has to offer). \r\nThe premise:\r\nTwo boys who areabout as old as teenage boys commit terror acts in Tokyo. \\n\r\nWhile this sounds interesting in theory, it was executed so poorly that it was cringeworthy at times. \\n\r\nIt wasn't even proper terrorism. It was simply two teenage boys trying to catch attention by blowing things up. They didn't ask for anything. They didn't do anything.\\n\r\nThey had the technology to hack into the computers of the police yet in the end didn't do anything with that. The show tries to come off as mature and mystical with smart protagonists yet they blow up everything just because \"they want attention\". Which kind of does make sense in the long-run seeing how they are orphans but the way they approached this was simply stupid. They had a nuke, blowing it up over the ocean would have been enough.\\n\r\nIt was way too predictable to be a mystery. \\n\r\nIt also had, as previously mentioned, no consistent theme.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nToo immature and irrational at times to be taken seriously. Had its moments but lacked in overall performance.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThey completely lacked any sort of appeal a character should have. \\n\r\nThey weren't given enough depth to be taken serious either. \\n\r\nLisa was basically a plot device to screw the protagonists over and make life harder for them. She had no kind of impact on the story apart from being the \"damsel in distress which has to be saved by the proud knight in bright armor (twelve).\"\\n\r\nFive was a one-dimensional character who was simply kind of a psychopath. Her actions, \"I want to kill you all\" - \"Oh wait, I don't\" - \"Nevermind, I will try to kill you\" - \"Nevermind, I love you\" didn't have any sense of consistency. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, incompetent police and there's only one officer who can save the day. \\n\r\nGENERIC AND BORING. Because you do know that only he can solve the riddles, you know that there won't be anyone if he suddenly were to quit his job who could stop the \"terrorists\".\\n\\n\r\nProbably the weakest aspect of the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nSound was fantastic and fit the show in a perfect way. The fact that, however, the art was so realistic whilst actually showing a cartoon world (not as in \"animated\" but as in \"nobody can die in this show either way unless we planned it\". Example: They created an EMP while claiming they never wanted to hurt anyone and only wanted to be remembered due to having been on their own for their whole lives. Yet they did not even consider what could possibly happen to those who use electronic devices to sustain themselves (e.g. heart rythm-helper and/or similar things.)). Otherwise it looked good and helped give off the atmosphere rather well for most of the part. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nOverall Zankyou no Terror is a solid 5-6/10 which suffered from flaws which could have been avoided if given enough time. It's quite a shame to see potential with budget being wasted once more. \\n\\n\r\nComing back to the first sentence: It does NOT deserve this high ranking MAL is giving it if you take it with a grain of salt instead of believing everything the industry tells you. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I was frankly disappointed with the untapped potential that could really make Zankyou no Terror a masterpiece. However, it took the route of a mystery/thriller and forgot to add a solid script, ruining much of its promise.\r\nWhen I first saw this show, I never fell for hype behind this. Yeah I know...  as a self-recluse introvert, I live in a cave and I don\u2019t follow anime on a seasonal basis, but a friend recommended this to me after a long hiatus. I later found out about the director being Shinichiro Watanabe, the same one who made the classic Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo and thefairly popular Kids on the Slope. Still, I wasn\u2019t excited for it, but I certainly thought it was cool. \\n\\n\r\n** Take this review with a heavy grain of salt when you don\u2019t mind the negativity or want to see why some don\u2019t like it. I do have some mild spoilers, but most of the time, the facts deal with the premise. I will notify if it really goes into a heavy spoiler.  **\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory- 4/10\\n\\n\r\n*Mild Spoilers*\\n\r\nVarious buildings and infrastructure were destroyed by a pair of teenagers named Nine and Twelve. Their motives are yet unclear as they broadcast themselves as terrorists under the alias as Sphinx 1 & 2. Giving out riddles for each of their targets, they provoke the police as the gifted detective, Shibazaki Kenjirou, trails on them. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the two have a mysteriously troubled past and have brought a timid yet bullied high school girl name Lisa Mishima as their accomplice. \\n\\n\r\nIn an 11 episode series, I probably wouldn\u2019t expect much of a plot as the first part of the series was rather formulaic. Our high school students plant a bomb, post a video about a mythological riddle on what appeared to be Youtube and Shibazaki gains a eureka moment to solve each passing puzzle. However, each riddle lacked relevance towards advancing the plot and further expounding the mysteries of the two characters. In another case, Oedipus Rex addresses a deeper meaning, but that was only towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the concept of destroying buildings without any casualties appears impractical, requiring a large suspension of disbelief- while technically, casualties also account the injured. Even if there are no deaths, people would lose jobs and the reparation costs would indirectly affect the citizen\u2019s personal lives. It doesn\u2019t have the realistic repercussions as it would appear to have and it makes a much more drastic event such as 9/11 seem watered-down and even harder to compare, aside from seeing an iconic tower get blown up. \\n\\n\r\n9/11 is a sensitive and a complicated topic to discuss, filled with various motives and conflicting emotional reactions towards that event. People of different backgrounds have, to some extent, (whether ambiguously right or wrong) justifications for their beliefs. But I don\u2019t see those same gray areas in ZnT. Now back on track. Nine and Twelve could have simply blown up abandoned buildings and it wouldn\u2019t make much of a difference. Casualties and property damage would be even less likely (since no one\u2019s there) and to a lesser extent, the attention would still be drawn out by the media. \\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the series appeared to throw out the realism with this anime as Five was ridiculously added. There were questionable actions when the FBI could have restrained her. Worst off, the story could have easily progressed without her. However, I\u2019ll give credit when credit is due as ZnT ties most loose ends, but it pushes back most of its answers instead of giving a consistently sound structure overall. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-4/10\\n\\n\r\nWithin the main cast of the high school adolescents of Nine, Twelve, Five, and Lisa Mishima as well as detective Shibazaki Kenjirou, it seemed a bit flat. Their characterization is done by the bare bones and their character development seems shaky.\\n\\n\r\nTwelve is the brown haired jokester and serves as a foil to the more reserved Nine. However, outside their massive intelligence for software hacking, name memorizing, and grenade chucking, it\u2019s somewhat difficult for me to describe the main characters (in a more negative fashion.)  Their motives for terrorism have been pushed aside until the end when it was fairly simple, to begin with. Their past was flimsily expounded when it should have been used to really explain their current behaviors and beliefs. In addition, they lack interactions with other people (besides Lisa) that normally would shine their personalities from different perspectives and asserting its flaws and strengths. However, one may say that they lack in interactions as a part of who they are, but that maybe a crucial mistake when their cat-and-mouse chase with Shibazaki felt disjointed and rather alienated, even when their screen time are close to each other. I mean within the entire half of the series, there was not a direct confrontation between them and it was mostly behind the recorded (or live) electronic screen. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless, possibly the most interesting character in the story would be Shibazaki. He provides a clear motive, based on a troubled past, to apprehend both Nine and Twelve. His habit of smoking helped compliment his overall personality and ambition. Though a minor detail, when he lights a cigarette in the no smoking zone of the police station, it suggests his ideals to follow a sense justice, not the formal law (you can see that applicable in the latter half). His background brought more historical relevance and topics that could be discussed further. Unfortunately, the progress has been stymied due to the monotonous riddles and Five. \\n\\n\r\nFive may have been the most apparent \u201cnail in the coffin\u201d when it comes to ZnT. Her outlandish behavior requires a large amount of suspension of disbelief and it felt unnecessary to have her as part of the cast. I can say the same for the rest of the police who appeared fairly one dimensional. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Lisa could have been a better-utilized character, but the plot served her to be a klutz and a damsel in distress. It is a shame the over protective mother could have been an interesting avenue for some sort of development, but it is never presented properly. \\n\\n\r\n[SPOILERS]\\n\r\nHypothetically, Lisa\u2019s father could have been a victim of terrorism. Her mother could have seen the news on what happened in the first episode (she never actually saw nor mentioned it) and this would give a better justification to be so overprotective and paranoid instead of a one-sided appeal that would weaken the strength of the analogy about the Japanese government's Prime minister  and its surge of nationalism. \\n\\n\r\nLisa could have developed a distrust for Nine and Twelve based on her mother\u2019s accusations, and yet also become conflicted to have the only people sensibly accept her be a pair of terrorists. Two sound sides would have its complexity and fair reasoning to develop her character as she slowly opens up to the two guys, learning that they haven\u2019t committed any casualties and also bear that same experience of being ostracized. \\n\r\n[END SPOILER]\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, this anime is gorgeous. \\n\\n\r\nI have no qualms about this aspect and I can fully agree even to the fanatics of this show. The animation directing was fast-paced with slick animation presented on highly attentive detail for its art. The choreography was aesthetically well-done and body language projected differently from each character. There were various executed moments that studio MAPPA visually showed without being explicitly telling. I will praise it for that.\\n\r\nThe color pallet and art style are different from your conventional anime, often utilizing more somber colors and realistic drawings. It is certainly highly budgeted, and for the most part, it is very consistent with its quality. There some goofs inevitably here and there, but I can't deduct points.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the biggest downside to the art style would be that everything else doesn\u2019t compliment to this kind of style. The outlandish events of the anime polarize the seemingly human presentation, making it more like a cinematic Hollywood spectacle with less sentimental value to it. Some may like it, but I personally don\u2019t.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound\u2019s quality is parallel to the art. The opening, \u201cTrigger,\u201d sounds weirdly syncopated and doesn\u2019t cleanly fall to people\u2019s expectations that normally be within the beat. The same can be said with the some of the OST composed by Yoko Kanno. However, for the most part, they are fitting and of high quality for this anime. The main issues for sound for me were the jarring English voice acting for Five (however, the character itself was more questionable.) Fortunately, the dubbing amends that minor quibble.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 4/10\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is where my review follows more into an ugly subjective rant.\\n\\n\r\nI came with the wrong mindset with this anime. I was expecting more realism on the aspects of terrorism, not some 11 episode thriller. It lacked the bite in dealing with terrorism, as the motives and target of the two characters should have been explicitly stated from the start to make me care more about the characters (especially when they are on a controversial position as terrorists.)\\n\\n\r\n[SPOILERS]\\n\r\nThere were many plot holes and illogical actions that really requires a large suspension of disbelief.   \\n\\n\r\nFor example, the police normally do not solve literary mythology, but rather they should track down physical evidence and forensics. They should not follow the clues guided by the perpetrators, (to the point of making them incompetent) for the sake of making Nine and Twelve seem highly intelligent. Also video analysis from the aliases named Sphinx 1 & 2 should have identified the so-called terrorist to be fairly young and pale skinned; one with brown hair and the other with black hair. I mean they don\u2019t even bother to cloak themselves. It is even to the point to make a safe assumption that they are high school students. The police could have done a background check on their alias as high school students and find the hidden bomb from the school locker. While I\u2019m bringing this up, the point of being in high school for our protagonists was largely forgotten besides going to the Tokyo Metropolitan Governmental Office, reeling in Lisa (from the beginning) and stuffing the prototype bomb in the locker (near the end.) \\n\\n\r\nThere were problems that there wasn\u2019t enough time to build character development in a series with only 11 episodes, but it exacerbated with that mystery because this show had numerous filler moments. Many of the episodic riddles could easily have been truncated and the events of Five seem shaky to even consider it as part of the plot. It really beat around the bush when it really didn\u2019t have enough time for it. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the point and theme of the story would possibly be the disconnection from the society. Those who are disconnected, they may share that common ground of separation and project their far cry towards the general norm with the hope that it will reach. However, the story lacks to address the majority who are connected with society. ZnT does not present that other side, in order to emphasize the stark contrast in the character\u2019s isolation or at least give more meaning to it. Because of this, it really felt one sided and one noted.\\n\r\n[END SPOILERS]\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall- mid 6/10 (Fair)\\n\\n\r\nIts major shortcomings would simply be its presentation and focus. It's difficult to support a political statement going into the grey areas of polemic concern when a large part dealt with a thriller route. Well, thought-out characters struggle to have depth when a mystery covers them more often than not, while some of the most beautiful directed scenes in a TV series loses its value when character and plot are on the weaker end.   \\n\\n\r\nI do see some well executed moments on its lesser details and recommend it to those who prefer a highly fast paced crime-thriller. It certainly takes a step forward by presenting maturity and becomes a breath of fresh air in the anime medium that often features silly high school students riddled with goofy stereotypes (even though it doesn't hurt to like those anime.) \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, it does take a step back when it comes to dealing with the responsibilities of that maturity. It really disappoints me above everything else to see the wasted potential of fine directing and an intriguing topic when minor tweaks can greatly improve the glaring flaws. I will not recommend it to those who prefer a more concrete plot with character development and for those who would rather see terrorism be addressed more properly.\\n\\n",

            "content": "After watching Zankyou no Terror, the best way to describe it is, an awesome idea gone horribly wrong. \"The idea was there, but the execution.... not so.\"\r\nTL;DR\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nArt: 6/10\r\nSound: 3/10\r\nCharacter: 5/10\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\r\nOverall: 5/10\r\nGood points:\r\n+ Exciting, suspenseful throughout\r\n+ Smart and cool main protagonists\r\n+ Good beginning arc\r\nBad points:\r\n- Poor character growth\r\n- Lousy and annoying antagonists (stop codeswitching between English and Japanese damnit!)\r\n- Lack of character depth\r\n- Lack of any coherent plot whatsoever\r\n- Horrible and unsatisfying resolution\r\n- Poor OP and ED themes\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nFor an 11-episode anime, you can't expect any plot deeper than a swimming pool (if you catch my drift), and that's exactly what this plot islike. At the beginning it seems to have some very deep and obscure meaning to it, and in the end, you jump straight into the pool and realize you are only waist-deep. It seems deep initially, but you can hardly even swim, you can only splash around like Magikarp.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall plot itself was okay, but none of it made much sense whatsoever. Two kids committing huge acts of terrorism, posting videos of when every bomb will go off and giving a riddle as to the location of the bomb (somewhere in Tokyo). It starts off exciting, that I can give 3 points for, and the suspense and excitement continues throughout the anime. But unfortunately, that's the only thing that this anime offers in terms of plot - suspense, lots of suspense, and excitement. There is some literary appreciation in the discourse of Oedipus, Greek Mythology and other riddle-associated things,  but other than that the anime lacks a WHOLE lot of depth. The main motive behind Nine and Twelve's actions seems too small and insignificant for them to be committing so much time and effort to blow things up (and to come up with all those riddles too). They could have easily exposed the truth of their origins via other more humane methods (such as getting evidence - since they are so smart anyway).\\n\\n\r\nThe next bad point is the coherence of the plot. Okay, so their goal is to \"send a message\" to Japan and they target all the areas that are related to the organization which kept them as test subjects. But wait a minute, all of this is literally JUST to make a police officer follow clues to find a similarity between all these targets? The government building, a train, a random building next to a shrine and an airport - all of these owned by some important person in the organisation. I mean, it's just about much easier if you just wrote down the name of the organization at every place you bomb, and you would send a much clearer message - to EVERYONE.\\n\\n\r\nNext, they want to send a message by detonating bombs everywhere, but there's a catch - they vow not to kill a single person? Okay, so you can make everyone evacuate a building, but can you really ensure not a single person is killed when rubble collapses? There are so many scenes in the anime where you see vehicles ENGULFED by the explosion, people running away from falling rubble, INCHES from being crushed. Even on the first attack, they literally had HALF A MIND to KILL LISA who was still in the building! If they were really all that \"righteous\" and \"moral\" in nature, why didn't twelve just get LISA to escape in the FIRST PLACE? Nine and Twelve even had the guts to discuss about the merits and demerits of having her alive.\\n\\n\r\nAnd not forgetting the whole atomic bomb sequence at the end. Okay, so it only caused an EMP wave that's supposed to be harmless and not kill anyone, but wait, there are many people in hospitals all round Tokyo on LIFE SUPPORT! Whoops, just killed them. It's fine, I'm sure they would have opted for euthanasia anyway! And sure you've landed all aircraft in the region, but what about ships? They are basically stranded at sea and the people there face death by starvation. Oh yes, and not to mention all the people at home who are going to DIE OF COLD in the middle of the night because all the thermostats aren't working anymore. Great job guys. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, another key incoherent part is where you start seeing the US Military/FBI/ISA involvement in all of this. They send their top FBI agent, who somehow HAPPENS to be Five. She just so HAPPENS to be in the FBI after she was taken away from the Athena Project? Sounds pretty unlikely, for a Japanese girl to so quickly rise up ranks in the FBI even if she was prodigy. She shouldn't even be working in a government agency because of her foreign origin.\\n\\n\r\nNot only that, but almost every US involvement scene is ridiculous and full of bullshit. Five and Clarence repeatedly, and I mean repeatedly, enjoy code switching between English and Japanese while TALKING TO EACH OTHER. It's perfectly normal that the switch when they talk to other people, but when they address each other, it's completely UNNATURAL for ANYONE to use both languages simultaneously and without any peculiar reason, other than the fact that the animators like trying their hand at getting the voice actors speak English... uughh!\\n\\n\r\nNext, the US was developing a prototype atomic bomb within Japan. Okay, so HOW did Nine and Twelve know that it was there in the first place? This was never explained. Just because they are really smart doesn't mean they know EVERYTHING?! So now the US wants to intervene after this atomic bomb was stolen. WAIT A SEC, then why didn't they intervene immediately AFTER the bomb was stolen? Why ONLY intervene when this series of terrorist attacks starts happening?\\n\\n\r\nHow does the US FBI even get exclusive rights and authority to boss around ALL OF TOKYO's police and security branches in the first place? WHO in his right mind would allow any of this foreign intervention to happen, especially in such a xenophobic place like Japan? Why does the Japanese government not do anything at all whatsoever about US involvement, clearly causing more and more explosions than the terrorists even did? This anime just fails on the logic side on so many levels.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's more, about Five's plan. Wait a minute, what exactly was Five's plan? Killing Nine? Capturing Nine? Oh wait, I remember, it was about getting the stolen bomb. She really went the round about way of killing her own partner and became obsessed with Nine, playing games with him instead of ever working towards capturing him and locating the bomb.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the final resolution? Completely bullshit. Random US helicopters fly into Japan airspace without so much as a license, and shoots two innocent civilians down without any backlash from the government, the police and so on. Complete and utter shitty ending. The anime basically spat into my face and said \"Screw this plot.\"\\n\\n\r\nOh yes, and I forgot about how cliched this whole anime is. Young orphans made test subjects in some secret facility for a secret project, hmm I wonder where I've seen something similar to this before. Oh and wait, they are called by their numbers. I don't suppose one of them would be called number four would you?\\n\\n\r\nLiterally, the only thing good about this plot is that it is exciting and suspenseful, nothing else makes any sense what soever, and you cannot take this anime seriously. I give it 3 points for excitement, 0 points for coherence and 0 points for depth.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art for this anime is pretty okay. It has good action scenes, but I felt that many scenes were too unnecessarily dark and it was difficult to see what was going on. Another thing is that there were instances where the camera was shaky in some of the scenes (one with a jet plane shaking off), I'm not sure if that was intentional, but it caused me a bit of dizziness.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nBackground sounds were good only when there was any action taking place. The OP theme was mediocre, while the ED theme was just bad, plain bad. The background music at the ferris wheel was also very unhelpful and did not suit the theme at all. I'm not sure why they went for the romantic feel, when it was clearly supposed to be a tense/suspenseful moment. The voice actor for Five really should not have tried English. It really wasn't understandable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters were sadly, very underdeveloped. We know abit about their backstory, but not much. How they came from a facility that drugged young kids and made them child prodigies was about all we got about them. Lisa is another quite unknown character. She shows some character growth - changing from a very useless, pathetic girl to a slightly stronger, but still quite pathetic girl. But we know nothing about her past or about why she was even being bullied at school in the first place?\\n\\n\r\nWe know that Lisa comes from a broken family but why is it really that she is constantly avoiding her mom? Why is it that she throws her bento set away in a toilet? Why is it that she wants to come home but at the same time doesn't want to come home? What made home so unhomely to her? I know her mum seems crazy in the anime, but at least tell us what the whole problem is rather than just blame it on the \"Dad leaves and Mum can't take this world anymore, and takes out her problems on her daughter\". Coz this wasn't even mentioned anywhere in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the antagonists, Five and Clarence, have even less backstory to them. Five, we know, came from the same facility, but all that we know is that she was the \"sole survivor\" of the lot. We don't really know why she didn't manage to escape when Twelve and Nine both did. She wants vengeance on Nine just because she couldn't win him in chess? Or at any other game? Cmon, stop being a childish nuisance in this anime. The US intervention completely ruined this anime and made it so complicated, that the characters themselves don't know how to react in any of those situations.\\n\\n\r\nTwelve and Nine do show some signs of growth, but very little. Twelve stays the way he is - cheerful and silly, whilst Nine stays serious, moody and cool.\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting character, Shibasaki, knows nothing about atomic bombs but knows a lot about Oedipus Rex and the story behind it. He is a badass cop who stops at nothing to solve the crimes that come his way, and he has a pretty loyal gang of people around him (who literally just met him in the anime, now that doesn't make much sense). He goes on to defy his superiors for justice and saves many innocent lives because of his virtues. But he has a dark backstory too, and was demoted because of a suicide of a person he knew, which he insisted was not a suicide, but vowed to get down to the bottom of it. Luckily for us, he gets his answer somewhere to the end of an anime with a rather unprecedented twist, which was more convenient than surprising.\\n\\n\r\nThe character cast is interesting, but not varied enough, and many characters were one-sided in nature. The character development and growth was also much lacking in this anime. 3 points for having 3 rather interesting characters. 1 point for character growth and 1 point for trying to provide some semblance of a backstory. I'm trying to be generous here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI can't say that I didn't enjoy this anime at all. But this horrible plot completely destroyed my expectations when I watched it. The touching scenes were not touching at all, and I literally laughed my ass off when I saw Twelve and Nine operating this crane thing next to a runaway airplane. I was surprised that this anime was not made a comedy, because it probably could have had higher ratings if it had more comic element inside.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the anime is quite good though, there were no points where I felt completely bored out. I was just completely dumbfounded at how stupid the plot could get and how convenient it was for the characters to be there at the right time, and somehow have the right equipment for the job. Still, at least it was enjoyable enough in terms of the suspense and actions scenes to keep watching, even though I knew this anime would end badly. Really badly.\\n\\n\r\nConcluding comments:\\n\r\nThis anime should only be watched if you literally have no other anime to watch. Just killing time, basically. It offers little plot depth, little development and growth, and is waaay less revolutionary than the author thinks it is. It's also highly overrated, I feel, on this website.",

            "content": "Zankyou no Terror, otherwise known as Terror in Resonance, is an anime with a much different focus than that of other shows. This is a show which is based around the theme of terrorism but it\u2019s not only the fact that this theme is seemingly different than that of others that makes it stand out, but it\u2019s the execution that really makes the show seem like a piece of art.  The visuals, the sounds, the characters, there just seems to be a lot of attention to detail. \r\nThe show itself spans 11 episodes and aired towards the later stages of the summer of 2014.Shinichir\u014d Watanabe, who has in the past done much loved shows such as Cowboy Bebop, worked together with Yoko Kano and Studio Mappa, to produce something that can only really be called a piece of art.\\n\\n\r\nBefore we delve into the details and what makes this short anime show really quite different, a short synopsis would be in order.  Zankyou no Terror\u2019s story revolves around two mysterious teens, who don\u2019t actually have real names but are instead referred to as Nine and Twelve. During the opening of the show, these two are shown to break into a high-security (clearly not) nuclear facility where thy steal plutonium. Then, half a year later, these same people call themselves \u201cSphinx\u201d and carry out a series of terrorist activities around Tokyo, which mainly involves blowing stuff up. One girl, Mishima, is caught up in their antics and as one thing leads to another, she eventually \u201cjoins\u201d Sphinx, although quite willingly so. From here on the story is focused upon the cat and mouse chase between the police force and Sphinx, although the story is not without its own twists. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show all seem to have some sort of substantial backstory and Zankyou no Terror seems to have got the balancing more or less right, from the number of characters to the amount of depth each has. Nine and Twelve are interesting in the fact that they are both quite intelligent and quick thinkers, often seeing through problems in a matter of seconds. However these teens also have their distinct differences. Nine is seemingly the more serious of the two, he wears spectacles and has that typical cold look in his eyes you\u2019d expect from characters of his type. He seems like the more technical and smarter of the pair as well and prefers to sit by his desk and control things from the background. Twelve is more flamboyant and prefers to get out and about on his motorbike, often getting his hands dirty doing all the nitty-gritty work. He is certainly the more cheerful of the two and seems to be most at ease when tossing around grenades or smoke bombs. Mishima on the other hand, is a slightly frustrating character, although the bullying she has had to deal with and her parents\u2019 divorce make her actions understandable. She is very timid and shy, however the way her life has unfolded and the situations she has had to face, mean that in the end she decides to join Sphinx, mostly due to her search of another life-albeit perhaps not her best life choice. The fact she is a little bit indecisive and can\u2019t quite seem to place herself as either one of good or bad, can get a little bit annoying at times, but once again, is understandable. Initially she wasn\u2019t a character I was particularly fond off, despite feeling sorry for her. Although by the end, I had come to terms with her mannerisms and found she had grown as a character, which was pleasant. \\n\\n\r\nThere are other characters of note in this show too. The detective who always seems to be keeping pace with the antics of Sphinx is Shibazaki. He is a man who is dedicated to his role as a detective, however he is also extremely smart and can see through or at piece together various pieces of the puzzle. His perception and attitude made him a character who was personally appealing to me and certainly never provided a dull moment. There is also one other major character who is introduced later on in the show, however this may constitute of spoilers and hence they will not get much of a mention. However, that said, this character is probably the least well fleshed out of all the characters and their mannerisms aren\u2019t wholly understandable and don\u2019t contribute a whole lot to the overarching plot- they seem more like a character forced in for a twist. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the plot of this how is what is gripping. The fact is that Nine and Twelve, who some may find likeable, are still terrorists and are causing damage to society, of course someone needs to stop them. However their antics never actually ever kill anyone and hence their aims are not always clear. This mystery over what their actual aim was, kept me interested. I didn\u2019t particularly dislike the two of them and as the show went on, they actually grew on me. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, their actions aren\u2019t the sort that can really be justified but as you slowly realise where the show is headed, your perceptions start to change. Their past is a key to the way they behave, they both are often shown to have visions and nightmares from the past. Upon analysis, if their aim isn\u2019t actually to kill anyone, then what is it? This question will keep you gripped until the end, which has a series of twists and turns which you have to go through to get there. \\n\\n\r\nThe whole show was extremely beautiful and visually pleasing. There were some scenes that you would have thought came out of a high-budget animation movie. The colours and the way they were blended in the realistic reconstruction of Tokyo meant you could look around during scenes and pick up various little details here and there. The explosions, the people, the constructions, most things down to the finer details, everything just looked stunning and I would say hats off to the producer for making the show look this good. The music was also perfectly moulded in with the show, the electronic sounds, the low grumblings, the sound effects, they all helped to set the mood for each scene and complemented the way the story was being told. Even the OPs and EDs were quite good in my opinion, albeit a little unsettling due to the fact they tried to bring out the main theme in the show- of mystery and fear. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show was a pleasing tale to witness. The bad guys weren\u2019t immediately marked out as wholly bad and sometimes you found yourself pondering over questions about what is really good and bad? Can they really justify their actions? (That applied to most characters, not just Nine and Twelve). While the story is not perfect, it\u2019s quite hard to be entirely on point with such a genre anyway, by the end of it you will feel like you have witnessed something quite different- and that\u2019s in a good way. In the end, it\u2019s not just the plot or the characters, but the visuals too, which add to the experience and you will feel as if this wasn\u2019t just a brief 11-episodes, but a piece of art with minor imperfections here and there. It certainly promises to be a good, thought-provoking watch. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8.7\\n\\n\r\n(If you like this show or want recommendations, then the best show to watch after this would certainly be Death Note, as both have that element of cat and mouse, the deep underlying mystery and questions on morality. Both are engrossing from start to end, however Death Note is a much longer show at 37 episodes.)\\n\\n\r\nTukky 12 \\n\r\n=)\\n",

Fortunately, she\u2019s not always on the forefront of the plot. There\u2019s always something else to focus on, but she adds nothing to the story. Her Engrish is great though.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, there\u2019s another girl who you\u2019re led to believe is important, but she never amounts to anything either. I thought she was going to be an audience proxy for us to learn about the two kids. They even call her an \u201caccomplice\u201d to blackmail her into keeping quiet. But her story goes nowhere. Thankfully she isn\u2019t a huge focus.\\n\\n\r\nAside from those major character issues, the rest of the show is really enjoyable. It has the best first episode I\u2019ve probably ever seen. I\u2019m a sucker for when anime has real world details. They use Macs to hack (because every terrorist is a expert hacker), they use BitCoin and TOR to hide their internet transactions, and you see people\u2019s reactions Twitter. The soundtrack is fitting with some touching scenes. The animation is fantastic. The plot is always moving forward and really builds up near the end.  Still a strong recommendation because at the very least it's an above average thriller, fast-paced enough to ignore the flaws, only 11 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nFuck Da Police/10",

            "content": "Zankyou no Terror is a show which is praised by many. Mostly for its premise and the themes of teenagers blowing up buildings instead of peeking on girls. It\u2019s definitely not your everyday anime and even for me it has been a pleasant surprise as I started watching it, with high expectations that is, after having read that top staff is working on the show. I couldn\u2019t wait until I finally got to watch the show, and now, one season later: Was this show really that good? In short: No. But let me explain why, before you downvote my review, if you haven\u2019t already byjust looking at the score I gave Zankyou No Terror.\\n\\n\r\nStorywise the best part Zankyou No Terror had to offer was its premise. Two teenagers called Nine and Twelve go on a spree of committing acts of terror in an alternate version of Japan. \u201cNot bad\u201d, I thought as I added this show to my Plan To Watch list and the introduction episode delivered great action and directing and lots of things already created questions. I hoped for a nice resolution and kept watching, mainly blinded by the gorgeous visuals, but the first couple of episodes in I noticed something odd. Where is the actual terror? Sure, blowing up a few buildings isn\u2019t a nice thing to do. People spent time and effort creating them and some teenagers destroy them?\\n\\n\r\nIsn\u2019t this rather a larger scaled act of vandalism since it\u2019s never mentioned or implied that people actually got killed in the process? Neither does the population actually seem terrified. There even are fans of the \u201cterrorists\u201d, despite them revealing any sort of political message to the general public. So probably just some edgy teenagers who think it\u2019d be cool to support people destroying buildings in the city, because who knows why. \\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s the first time I really started to question this series and its writing. The second time would be the riddles. Superficially they seem smart and well thought through, but digging a little deeper than merely scratching the surface, they\u2019re actually kind of dumb and if you consider the outcome and the actual motives on Nine and Twelve, they are mere filler and should not be there in the first place as they do nothing but dragging out the plot and to keep the, pretty dumb, police busy.\\n\\n\r\nAround the middle a new character called Five is introduced who is cooperating with the Americans and their motives are pretty vague, as well as how they can act above the local police forces. The whole appearance of this character killed pretty much all the hopes I had for Zankyou No Terror to become an actually interesting cat and mouse-game between officer Shibazaki and the \u201cterrorists\u201d calling themselves Sphinx. Instead it resulted in some sort of hate triangle between the three parties and most of the stuff which happened in relation with the new character had nothing to do with the actual outcome anyway.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to plot holes and plot conveniences Zankyou No Terror does not disappoint in being a disappointment there either. Without wanting to spoil too much, where did Sphinx get intel about a nuclear bomb being developed on Japanese soil? Why even commit those acts of vandalism? The justification makes no sense. There would have been tons of other ways to get across what they intended. Why promote Zankyou No Terror as a show about terror when it\u2019s not? How was it important that Sphinx move to a school? They have been there like two times. The only reason they did was to introduce the cast to Lisa, a new charac- ehm plot device. Seriously. There\u2019s no other way I could explain that Sphinx went to school. There\u2019s so much I expected and so little I got. Speaking of Lisa, let\u2019s move on to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nLadies first, we have Lisa.  A walking dumbo and plot device. She is being bullied at school and doesn\u2019t have it easy at home. Supposedly a tragic character she just ends up being an obstacle for Nine and Twelve, as her psyche is not explored at all. Does she like being a bad girl? Does she not know what she wants in the first place? She was just walking around, crying and getting kidnapped. She and Twelve had some kind of romance going on which also felt kind of forced considering the situation they are put in.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Twelve. More of a chaotic guy and Nine\u2019s comrade. They both share a mysterious past which mainly gets explored in flashbacks and like the very last episodes. Not much to say about either because they both don\u2019t develop at all. Five is also one of those with the same past as Nine and Twelve and they all are super smart and seemingly flawless. The reason as to why keep the past of Sphinx a secret is also baffling to me as well as the occurrence of flashbacks. It felt as if the writers just cast some die and randomly decided the intervals of them having flashbacks to justify small doses of exposition. The most intriguing character to me was officier Shibazaki, but that doesn\u2019t mean that much in the show that is Zankyou No Terror and its cast. Really disappointed me there, Zankyou No Terror.\\n\\n\r\nWhere I did not get disappointed though were in the category of visuals and sound design as well as the splendid directing of Shinchiro Watanabe. The backgrounds and lightning and effects were gorgeous and I had a blast just looking at the detailed art work. The rain and water also looked great and I barely have any criticism about how Zankyou No Terror was presented superficially. The soundtrack by Yoko Kanno was just as expected brilliant, as well as the Opening and Ending themes. A thing which kind of put me off though was the Engrish in some of the songs and the dialogues. \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy Zankyou No Terror though? Kind of. It felt like an action flick you can just enjoy without overthinking it too much. Is there worse shows with around 11 episodes you could watch? Definitely. I can see the appeal this show has and I kinda appreciate its effort but in the end Zankyou No Terror is not a show worth calling \u201canime of the season\u201d or \u201canime of the year\u201d. I don\u2019t even think anyone will remember it in the near future. That popularity does not equal the quality of a show is obvious and I\u2019m not saying it is horrible. Wasted potential and a definite disappointment are quite more fitting though.\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nTerrorism is a difficult subject to talk about. There are a lot of factors in play that normal civilians don't understand. Besides these behind-the-scenes secrets, there are ulterior motives, dangerous decisions, and mass suffering. On top of all this, terrorism is universally associated with evil. However, Zankyou no Terror attempts to break this axiom by presenting a thrilling story that is just not properly executed.\r\nSTORY\r\nZankyou no Terror starts off seemingly typical, with our two leads, Nine and Twelve, transferring into a new school. However, what they begin to do is anything but ordinary.\r\nZnT is a thriller. As such,the story and journey are paramount to how well the show is perceived. Early on, Nine and Twelve's motives are shrouded in mystery and intrigue. There's a wonderful dynamic at play between them and the veteran detective Shibizaki that is commonly seen in many thriller shows. But what ZnT does different is that it portrays the Nine and Twelve as anti-heroes. You know what they are doing is wrong, but you know what they intend to accomplish is right. Most of the thrills come not from the actual terrorist acts themselves but rather in the way that Shibizaki attempts to figure out what Nine and Twelve have planned.\\n\\n\r\nShibizaki's epiphanies may come from fellow detectives or historical insight, but this is something that the show does nice as well. The riddles and connections that Nine and Twelve create are mostly factual. Meaning, the characters are not just making things up to move the story along. There is a line that connects the dots between their various acts. Shibizaki begins to realize this, in typical thriller fashion, but that is part of the fun, learning alongside him.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with the factual basis for their riddles, I found the explanations behind their terrorist acts to be nicely done as well. The show presents proper ideas and realism behind the things Nine and Twelve do, such as using TOR for online purchases or chemistry analysis on the type of bomb they used on a building. By being this realistic, the show makes itself even more \"relatable.\" Or in other words, what they do could happen in real life.\\n\\n\r\nThe show maintains this high quality for the first half or so. However, it begins to lose its sense of realism with the introduction of a new character, called Five. Her actions and general power deviate the show from being this back and forth between Nine/Twelve and Shibizaki to all three of them going up against Five. This change in perspective shifts the focus away from Nine and Twelve achieving their goals towards this conflict with Five.\\n\\n\r\nIt isn't until the end of the series that the focus shifts back to what it originally was all about. The ending itself is both bittersweet and slightly underwhelming. The former comes from what actually happens in the shows final moments. I found it to fit narratively; I don't think it could have gone any other way. The latter is a problem that stems from Five's introduction and conflict. The shift in focus causes a shift in character importance as well. Since the show began to focus less on Nine and Twelve, the ending doesn't have as much of an impact on me as it should have.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nFrankly speaking, Zankyou no Terror's art and animation is spot on.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style heavily reminds me of a movie. The way everything is drawn, from the characters to the environments, seemed to look as if they were done by multiple studios, not just one. The show does a nice job of making you feel as if the characters are living within a city, with its bustling people, hard-at-work police stations, and detailed buildings.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to its movie-like qualities, this is one of the first shows to make me feel as if it had camera choreography heavily looked at. A lot of the shots are either taken at interesting angles or are done in unique ways. One of the most prominent examples is when Lisa is running down the stairs in the building. The \"camera\" follows her from the front as she makes here way down. It gives not only a sense of urgency but also this great sense of creativity. The show does this a lot throughout the series, giving us beautiful shots, and I thank them for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are also nice. They remind me a lot of Samurai Champloo with their detailed looks and fluid movements. And while Five may not be the best character, her design as well is nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror is somewhat split down the middle when it comes to how good and bad its characters really are.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the good. Nine and Twelve, as mentioned previously, are not truly bad guys, but are instead \"anti-heroes.\" They aren't looking to kill but rather send a message. They have an interesting background that is explored slightly but in terms of actual characterization there isn't much to be had. Again, for a thriller, the characters don't necessarily have to be complex. So I think the show did a nice job of making us at least understand where they are coming from. While we may not deeply and truly care for them, as a viewer, I want to see them succeed.\\n\\n\r\nThe strongest character is by far Shibizaki. Acting as the \"smart\" detective, he knows that what the boys and the Americans are doing isn't what it fully seems from a first glance. He has his own problems that he deals with on a personal level, and is never afraid to ask others for help. That's the sign of a good detective; gathering intel from any and all sources. His fight against (and with) Nine/Twelve was interesting and provided him with his own sense of fulfillment.\\n\\n\r\nOn the weak side, we'll start with Five. Part of her problem was the way in which she acted. In the same vein as Nine and Twelve, we weren't really sure as to why she was doing the things she was doing. Was it some sort of revenge? Was she being controlled by somebody else? While the mystery behind Nine/Twelve drives the narrative, her background seemed to put on the brakes. Beyond her general mystique, her overwhelming sense of power, which I briefly mentioned, suspends belief too much in comparison to the rest of the show. She has mass control over cameras and can seemingly blow up anything she wishes. While she is warned periodically throughout the series, it never feels as if she doesn't have complete control over the situation. In hindsight, her character was probably an unnecessary addition that distracted the audience too much from the story the show was trying to tell.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I would argue that it is not Five but Lisa who is the weakest character in the show. While she initially may seem to be undergoing change by interacting with Nine and Twelve, she was used simply as a plot device for the majority of the second half. We don't learn much about her other than her oppressive feelings both at home and at school. I would have liked to have seen her grow out of her shy shell but she was never really given such an opportunity. By the end, she was just a cute girl caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is quite good. It has a whimsical nature about it that makes you feel as if you are floating on clouds. Its sense of mysteriousness also fits well with the backgrounds surrounding Five, Nine, and Twelve. The ED is very good. I am a big fan of melancholy, depressing, or dark pieces (my favorite being PMMM's ED). The ED helps to convey Lisa's sense of oppressiveness previously stated and her wish to break free or fly away from her current predicament.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack is nicely done. It has tense pieces and beautiful ones that go nicely with the situations at hand.\\n\\n\r\nFor voice acting, Shunsuke Sakuya's performance of Shibizaki was well done. His voice fit the character very nicely.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror is special because of its take on terrorism. Not many people would have the balls to use it as a vessel for good. But the show does just that.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best parts from the show is its great use of symbolism. A memorable scene from the show is Lisa and Twelves escape on his motorcycle, demonstrating their escape not only from society but from the worries that trouble them so. Another pertinent example is the ferris wheel scene and everything it represents. There is also Nine and Twelves final act which allows Lisa to finally start over from scratch, or more simply it is \"the end of one chapter and the beginning of the next.\" (credit to my friend /u/shibbitydobop, a reddit user, for this example and quote!)\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the show is beautiful. The story telling, the music, and the art all come together to create this unique package that was destined to go down as an anime classic. But while Zankyou no Terror didn't reach that level, it is still a must watch for those who enjoy the medium.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, starts strong, dips for a bit, and ends okay\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, movie-like with great \"camera work\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Nine, Twelve, and Shibizaki are good but Five and Lisa are bad\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, fantastic OP, ED, and soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, interesting concept with deeper meanings\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "//wipes tears away after episode 11// This is truly a beautiful anime. And probably one of the best this season.\r\nNow I normally give input on every category like for the story, art, sound, etc. but this review will be a lil different. I'm just going to point out all the great things in Zankyou no Terror.\r\nAt first glance this anime seems general and nothing too special. A lot of people compare this to Death Note. And after finishing it, and while I can still cling to the idea that it's similar, this anime is completely different in a lot of aspects. :)\r\nThe plot for thisstory is slow paced in parts, but it really builds up the suspension and overall impact that this anime makes. People say it's boring because it's just about two guys, Twelve & Nine blowing up buildings. But in reality, that small concept is more complicated than first anticipated. This story keeps you guessing and you never know what's going to happen in the next episode. I looked forward to this every week and now I'm a lil sad it's over. But trust me, this is something you don't find everyday; it's an anime you discover every couple of years. \\n\\n\r\nAside from being terrorists, you realize what kind of people Nine & Twelve really are. As well as Lisa, the regular girl who got caught up in this affair on accident. You realize the true intentions of the motives behind each bombing. The true realization in the very end, in episode 11, where everything falls into place, is something beautiful. Don't be discouraged by just the surface of this anime, Zankyou no Terror has so much more to offer.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound for this anime is another stunning aspect. I haven't seen such great sound from an anime in a long time. The opening & ending are truly beautiful. It tells the story of the anime. It's like a glimpse into the plot; it's soothing. And OSTs are truly something. There's Icelandic words in some of the songs played in this anime. Like the OST \"Von.\" Why you may ask?\\n\\n\r\nBecause after all \"V-O-N means Hope.\"\\n\\n\r\nI truly enjoyed this anime. It really deserves to be noticed even more so. I haven't found something this beautiful in a very long time. Very few animes can make me smile, cringe, scream, and sob this much. The relationships and bonds between Lisa, Twelve, Nine, and Five share are truly the utter highlight of this anime. The ending will fill you with so many emotions. Whether it's sadness or happiness, I recommend this to anyone",

            "content": "Zankyou no Terror expects to be taken very seriously. It desperately wants every single moment to feel extraordinarily heavy. Thanks to the use of dim colors, a melancholic soundtrack, and the resounding lack of energy from any of the cast, it's obvious that the director is trying to play your emotions like a symphony. There's really no problem with this, but where it essentially screws up is in the execution of all of this seriousness. ZnT is so obsessed with moving the plot forward that it puts little to no thought into making sense of anything that happens. There's a scene where the detective, Kenjirou,is absolutely baffled about where this group of terrorists might be, and while he was speaking to one of his co-workers, this co-worker was glued to some mobile game, and that game gave Kenjirou the exact clue he needed in order to figure out where these terrorists would be. It's troubling to think that our detective found something out solely based on his friend playing that specific part of that game at that exact time. That's an insanely laughable coincidence. If this guy wasn't playing whatever he was playing, the show would have turned out much differently and perhaps it wouldn't have continued at all. Zankyou no Terror does this a lot throughout the story, and it makes it so damn hard to take seriously. They want you to respect Kenjirou's detective skills, yet it almost always relies on coincidence. It's sorta similar to how House M.D. cures his patients by accidentally figuring things out throughout the mini-arcs of the episodes. He's not actually smart, the writer just wants him to appear smart in front of people who don't care enough to think about it. The same can be said for Zankyou no Terror. Kenjirou was never smart, he just figures things out by coincidence to get the story over with quicker.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest complaint here is that there was absolutely no attempt to create a realistic and intelligent detective. Instead, the show was too focused on being a thriller that doesn't care about how the terrorists get found, as long as they get found and the story carried on.\\n\\n\r\n\"Oh, Sherlock, what do we say about coincidence?\"\\n\\n\r\n\"The universe is rarely so lazy.\"\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nDevelopment and Synergy\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of how the characters come to be, the two mains (Nine and Twelve) have very interesting, although vague backstories. The ambiguity added a certain charm to it, but unfortunately this charm is hard to fully realize when you get to know them, and slowly realize that they aren't very likable. The show spends almost no time developing the characters because it's so focused on moving forward with the plot. There are scenes where you see romance occur which is likely an attempt to humanize them, but the romance feels too forced to even count as \"development\". At most, the creators give us brief hints at their backstory, but that never tells us about them. Instead, it simply shows us where they come from and what happened to them to make them get here. Zankyou no Terror's eleven episodes go by so quick that it has almost no time to take a rest and develop these characters. You could argue that doing so might've screwed with the pacing, but there have been many films that have introduced us to five or six characters at once, never stopped the action, and by the end, had us falling in love with the cast.\\n\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror may give us a backstory to these characters, but the characters themselves are never fully fleshed out and it feels like their personalities aren't important to the actual objective of the show. It's understandable that the anime was going for a more plot focused narrative rather than being character driven, but a more obvious attempt to flesh out the two mains would have been admirable.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nTwelve and Lisa\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the romance, it creates for some of the most visually and aurally stunning scenes in the series and arguably in all of anime. However, there's no need to call it anything more than \"visually and aurally stunning\" as the more you dig, the worse it gets. The romance is about as forced as you would expect from a series with seriously underdeveloped characters. Twelve and Lisa seem to have this \"unbreakable\" bond even though he had threatened to kill her only a couple of episodes before they started working together and not much was done to develop their relationship in the time between that. Their romance goes as far as a collection of beautiful looking scenes with an absolutely incredible soundtrack accompanying it. It never felt like there was a true connection between the two and it seemed like they loved each other just for the sake of loving each other. It's easy to understand why someone like Lisa would fall madly in love with Twelve, but for why Twelve would fall in love with Lisa? It seems ridiculous. Lisa was lonely and desperately looking for someone to share her moments with, so her falling in love with a dangerous guy who does bad things to everyone except for her makes sense. However, Twelve never seemed like the kind of character interested in that sort of thing and even if he was, it was never shown to us. Because of this, Lisa feels less like a substantial character and more like she was made with the sole purpose of humanizing Twelve, and it was a huge waste of potential for her development.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nHard to Hate\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror may have many problems, but, it's difficult to dislike the series. In fact, Zankyou no Terror is a very successfully engaging thriller. Every second keeps you at the edge of your seat, and a majority of the scenes are beautifully illustrated and gorgeously orchestrated. It's easy to see why so many got obsessed with the show. When immersed into what you see, you sometimes have trouble acknowledging flaws. You could say that the show is a success specifically based on how much it engages the viewer, but that's an extremely biased way of looking at it. In other words, if it entertains you, you'll like it. If not, you won't like it. Besides from the entertainment aspect, there isn't much to take from it. This is one of the reasons why it's easy to have mixed feelings about Zankyou no Terror. Although it was enjoyable, it was a gigantic mess. However, if you look at it as nothing more than a simple thriller (even though it tries to be much much more), you might have a hell of a time.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nInteresting Story\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nThe plot to Zankyou no Terror is eccentric and occasionally ridiculous, but the overall theme is admirable. The story starts out simple but slowly gets more and more complex and once you've reached the end, you feel like you've finished off with the complete opposite of what you started with. This isn't a bad thing, as the ending to Zankyou no Terror is pretty compelling.\\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling anything, the plot is possibly one of the best parts of the show, however, this is only because the story works in unison with the action. It's safe to say this show would be even worse if the elements of suspense were removed or altered since they can't really exist without each other. However, relying your show entirely on suspense isn't a good thing. Having more things to admire this show for would have been preferred, but unfortunately, all it gives us is an anime that's beautiful on the surface.\\n\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror also uses excessive amounts of symbolism through illustration and it's rather interesting. Sometimes it feels a bit pretentious, but in most cases it makes the narrative moderately more compelling.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"villain\" of the series also felt underwhelming. It seemed like she should have had more impact on the story than she actually did. Sure, she caused trouble for the main characters a whole lot, but it never feels like anything important actually came out of her. She clearly meant something to Twelve and Nine, but she never meant anything to the viewers and that's easily associated with her poor development.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nPerception\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror was never trying to develop its characters or make any type of sense. It attempts to be symbolic and meaningful, but in essence, it knows for a fact that it is a quick, heart-pumping action thriller. This is part of the reason why it's so easy to enjoy. It's similar to watching something like John Wick, it has moments where it does try to be more than it actually is, but in reality, it's just an insane \"rule of cool\" action movie.\\n\\n\r\nDoes this take away from the experience? No, not entirely. In fact, only after finishing Zankyou no Terror did all of its flaws manage to find its way through my thick skull. Once you finish, you'll find an abundance of problems, but while watching, you have so much fun that you won't care enough to acknowledge the flaws. That isn't me trying to debase fans of the show or anything, I experienced the exact same phenomenon.\\n\\n\r\nThat's why it is one of the few shows where people (including myself) have trouble determining if it should be judged on how good it is, or how entertaining it is. Occasionally, the feeling of \"I enjoyed that show a lot\" hits me, but then sometimes the feeling of \"that show was pretty shitty\" hits me. How to determine a balance between the two? I have no fucking clue.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nVerdict\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Zankyou no Terror has a lot of flaws, it's easy to admire. It's an anime full of mindless thrills, but when the thrills aren't happening, it's pretty underwhelming. For the most part, character development is awful and looking at it from a standpoint that is logically sound, it's a mess. However, the show is too compelling to disdain. Watching Zankyou no Terror keeps you at the edge of your seat for a majority of the time and it's unfortunate that the qualities of a good anime couldn't mix with the already present qualities of an extremely thrilling anime. Watch Zankyou no Terror for the thrills and only the thrills, don't go in expecting anything more than heart-pumping action.",

            "content": "When Zankyou no Terror, also known as Terror in Resonance, first came out and right after finishing it's run during the Summer Season of 2014, it was a show that had a lot of buzz for \u201cAnime of the Year\u201d. It\u2019s easy to see why, since it\u2019s a show directed by Shinichir\u014d Watanabe (a critic favorite, most known for his work on a little show called Cowboy Bebop) and the soundtrack was composed by Yoko Kanno (whose noteworthy compositions are too numerous to count). With this all-star crew working on the show, many people were already locking this into the top spot from this yearand after an explosive first episode they seemed to be vindicated. Finally! Something extremely original and totally different than 99% of anime we get these days! This has got to be the best anime this year right?\\n\\n\r\nWell\u2026kind of? Because when you look at the technical side of this show, it\u2019s absolutely fantastic. Watanabe and Kanno absolutely knocked it out of the park with this anime, combining a gorgeous, super realistic and distinct art style alongside a brilliant score to create the best made anime of the year. It was great to see an art style that was able to make each and every character unique without having to rely upon outlandish costumes or physics-defying hair to make everyone look original. The animation was absolutely breath-taking as well, with everything looking absolutely stunning: from simple backgrounds to the numerous explosions and chase scenes throughout the show. Moving onto the sound of the show, it\u2019s absolutely incredible and the OST is one I consider to be some of Kanno's best work. There\u2019s not a single track that\u2019s not good or better and the music is placed perfectly throughout the show to intensify whatever mood that particular scene is trying to invoke in the viewer. The opening is absolute perfect fit for the show, and is a good song to boot, and the ending is really great as well. Hell, even the voice acting is spectacular, and with the exception of this girl (who\u2019s the root of most of the show\u2019s problems) Terror in Resonance has the best English I\u2019ve ever heard from a Japanese cast. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem\u2019s creep up whenever we dive into the show\u2019s script. As you could probably gather from the anime\u2019s title, this is a show about terrorism. Story-wise, it\u2019s an incredibly solid show, and it does a great job of getting you hooked early on with a couple of amazing first episodes that makes you intriguing to discover the mystery that shrouds our two teenage terrorists. It also establishes the show as extremely mature and has a very serious tone throughout the story that meshes perfectly with anime\u2019s super-realism style. You honestly feel like this could happen in our world since Terror in Resonance does a great job of making sure that its character\u2019s master plans and schemes are logical, simple, and realistic. It was really cool to see a couple of Chessmasters at work that could actually exist in our world, not reliant upon supernatural powers in order to make their convoluted schemes actually work.   \\n\\n\r\nHowever, near the half-way point, a new primary antagonist is introduced and this is where the story is knocked off course to \u201cAmazing Plot Station\u201d. From this point onward the situations the characters are put in and the plans of our Antagonist begin to feel more and more unbelievable, with plot conveniences being thrown around like confetti at a New Year\u2019s Eve party. At times it was tough to watch the show in the later half as you just became increasingly frustrated with everyone\u2019s incompetence and questioning how Five is allowed to get away with what she\u2019s doing (especially since it\u2019s later revealed that her handler could have stopped her at any time and didn\u2019t because\u2026we need a plot somehow right?). \\n\\n\r\nAnd now we arrive at the weakest aspect of this show, its uninspired cast. Coming from the crew that brought us some of the most colorful and well-developed characters of all-time within the cast of Cowboy Bebop, it was extremely disappointing to see how bland and one-dimensional all the characters in Zankyou no Terror ended up being. After 11 episodes, pretty much every single character of importance can be summarized as: \u201cA Genius Who Doesn\u2019t Play By The Rules!\u201d the Cold, Distant Edition (Nine), the Perky Version, the Psychotic One, and the Grumpy Grandpa. Not to mention that one of our \u201cmain\u201d characters is the epitome of fail and literally doesn\u2019t affect the plot except for one point in the entire show. Terror in Resonance was so concerned with keeping a shroud of mystery over our two main characters-Nine and Twelve-that the writers\u2019 never gave us time to get to know them beyond their actions and actually emotionally invest in them as characters. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a shame too, since this could have easily been fixed by having Nine or Twelve tell their backstory and/or motivation to Lisa-our tagalong female lead-and by extension us the audience. It would have allowed us to easily associate this tragic past with our two leads, causing us to sympathize with them and feel more attached to both characters. Instead, this information is revealed to us by a third party who has no real connection to our protagonist to yet another third-party who\u2019s been trying to catch Nine and Twelve the entire show. Giving us our main character\u2019s backstory in this round-about way makes it much harder to associate it with or feel anything for Nine and Twelve because of it. It\u2019s the difference between actually watching someone\u2019s house burn down right before your eyes and simply hearing a house burned down. With the latter, it\u2019s just something you hear about, shrug and then forget about. Sure you feel a little bad for those people, but you feel a whole lot worse if you actually see it happen for yourself.    \\n\\n\r\nA lack of character motivation is the primary downfall for pretty much everyone in this show. Nine and Twelve\u2019s full logic and motivation isn\u2019t completely explained until literally two minutes before the ending credits of Episode 11. Five, our primary antagonist, motivation is left entirely in the dark except that she\u2019s apparently obsessed with Nine because of wouldn\u2019t you like to know. Lisa\u2019s just there because she has nothing better to do and the detective character\u2019s motivation is based on a flimsy-ly handled Politic Corruption sub-plot and because he thinks nuclear weapons are bad *slow sarcastic clap video*. Because none of the character\u2019s motivations are properly established this led to them all feeling less like characters and more like plot devices solely there to move the story from Point A to B.  \\n\\n\r\nDespite these fairly significant flaws though, I was never once bored while watching Terror in Resonance. The mature and serious tone of the show was a refreshing change of pace from what you usually get from anime, what with all the fanservice and otaku fetishes you usually find today. Plus, the story rebounds from a subpar middle with an excellent climax and appropriate, satisfying conclusion to the story. So while the story and characters weren\u2019t quite good enough to keep up with the show\u2019s presentation and be worthy of \u201cBest Anime of 2014\u201d, it still ended up being a really good anime that\u2019s a great watch for any fan of the \u201cPsychological Thriller\u201d genre.",

            "content": "*Updated after completing the anime)\r\nBest anime of this summer?You got it horribly wrong. (judge this review after watching at least 7 episodes)\r\nI am a HARDCORE detective/mystery genre fan that is why I had very high expectations of this show when I started it but it was a downhill slope starting from episode one. I am not the type of person that likes to write entirely UNCONVENTIONAL reviews but my mind forced me on this one Some people might be bragging about its ORIGINALITY but guess what?*Spoiler*Ever heard of the anime \"MONSTER\"?The characters background is entirely COPIED from that masterpiece anime. I wanted to wait tillthe show is complete before writing this review but I could not hold myself back anymore.\\n\r\nOverwhelming positive reviews of ZnT are only because of hasty people judging it by first two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nStory 3/10\\n\r\n*Spoilers*\\n\r\nTwo teenagers( with mysterious background) attempting terrorist attacks while preventing casualties and a smart-ass detective trying to stop them. Actually I have NO problem with it whatsoever. The use of Greek mythology as puzzles is a little awkward but one can live with it because it is done cleverly. It even focuses on small details of those terrorist attacks. Which should make it an above average anime. So what is wrong with the story then? The problem is that this show presents itself as a serious and REAL crime/detective anime. Then all of a sudden a foreign teenage GIRL '5' appears and sits on the arses of the whole police department of Japan, lets bombs blast (and even makes police plant the bombs *facepalm* ) in public places just in order to catch two wanna-be terrorists. On the top of that starts playing chess with the terrorists on the Airport screens and no one gives a f***, no the absurdness is not over, she plants bomb in a passenger plane and tries to hit it on the airport,risking lives of hundreds, just to kill 2 to 3 terrorists and the Japanese authorities are sleeping? Is this a goddamned REAL CRIME DETECTIVE show? Moreover so when she herself orders to \"dont shoot\" the terrorist('9') like 3 minutes ago!! Poor writing must not be ignored in such genres.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nThe art was pretty suitable for a serious and realistic show and was most of the time OUTSTANDING. Although the anime itself turned out to be mediocre but the art was clearly meant to give ZnT a realistic touch.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are pretty decent, the BGM is usually drum music which is unconventional but certainly pleasant to the ears.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nAs already mentioned, the background story of 9 and 12 is literally pulled out of 'Monster' anime, but even then the show reveals this story so late in the show when it does not really matter anymore. 12 is a happy go lucky kind of character and remains the same throughout the show while 9 is your usual serious badass protagonist with a soft corner in his heart somewhere. The girl Lisa has a screwed up Mom who is over-obsessed with her daughter. Lisa herself is a cliche character who cannot do anything and is extremely fragile and emotionally unstable, her purpose and reason is yet to be explored, maybe a hostage/handicap character. The famed antagonist '5' which I've been taking about for quite a long time(who is an old 'pal' of our protagonists) is also completely unexplored, but she wants some kind of revenge on the main characters, due to her hot-air-ballon-ego at the expense of whole Japanese citizens, her personality can be summed up in one word i.e. bitch.*Spoiler-ends*\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nZnT started rather brightly, but a lot of flaws in its \"REALISTIC\" story which is flushed down the gutter after 5 episodes, negligible character development till late in the anime makes it a mediocre anime as it progresses.\\n\r\nBeing a huge fan of crime, terrorist and detective shows, it is safe to say that ZnT had a lot of potential but it is utterly wasted when the show deviates from reality, a bit of deviation is digestible(Detective Conan), but when such an anime completely ignores reality just to heat up the rivalry between protagonists and antagonist...... it ends up choking the mystery fans like us.\\n\r\nThough judging it by the eye of an ordinary viewer, the anime is above average(that is,if you ignore all the bullshit and plot holes).",

            "content": "Back in the summer of 2014 a controversial advert for an anime based on terrorism. My initial thoughts were that this could be a very good anime if portrayed well. Others thought the topic was more taboo especially with the terror attacks that have occurred in America to say the least.  However Terror in Resonance does a great job of portraying the lives of two teenage terrorists. \r\nStory: \r\nThe story follows two terrorists Nine and Twelve who have just transferred into high school presumably to avoid suspicion. On their way to school the two run into Lisa Mishima who is being bullied. Shortly afterdiscovering that Nine and Twelve are terrorists she decides to leave her broken down home and joins the group known as \u2018Sphinx\u2019\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few things in this show that I wouldn\u2019t have initially thought. Sphinx\u2019s reluctance to kill innocent civilians seems abnormal for terrorists. The thought process behind Nine and Twelve\u2019s goals are to establish a message without the use of killing. Something which I thought was executed very well. Without the presence of death and destruction you would have thought it would be a drab show. However I think it\u2019s the beautiful method of portraying their anger, pain and sadness which really captivated me. \\n\\n\r\nThe way Sphinx are constantly avoiding capture or seem to be one step ahead was also very intriguing, this lead to comparisons from fans to the likes of death note, which is understandable to say the least. The innovation, the thought process and the effort put into their work was very well done.  It was the rivalry between Sphinx and Kurahashi which lead to the main comparison as he was tasked with solving the riddles that Sphinx threw at the police agencies.\\n\r\nI did feel that the use of Lisa was unnecessary. She was more of a plot device for Twelve\u2019s character more than an actual character. Whilst she did have her uses and moments overall her character would not have been missed. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nTerror in Resonance has few characters but they are very well executed.\\n\r\nFirst I\u2019ll start with nine. Nine is effectively the leader of Sphinx. He uses his brilliant mind to execute that use of explosives and methods of planting them. He doesn\u2019t care much for Lisa and is very goal driven. This leads to less development for him as a character as I don\u2019t see him change to any substantial degree. His relationship with five was very personal as they battle wits and ultimately nine comes out on top. \\n\\n\r\nTwelve is the more outgoing and energetic member of Sphinx. He is very good with engineering and operating vehicles. His relationship with Lisa seems to be the change in his development. Though he is childish at heart being with Lisa gives him a sense of responsibility which we don\u2019t see from the start. I thought both Twelve and Lisa would be a cute couple; however I\u2019m glad the series never implied an intimate relationship between the two as I felt it would have disrupted the story. \\n\\n\r\nLisa Mishima is your typical high school girl who is a social outcast and is consistently bullied. Her life at home isn\u2019t great either as her deranged mother drives Lisa to a breaking point. Her character changes drastically after being with twelve and nine. Once shy, timid and being treated like dirt, she now becomes a more positive girl even if her cooking isn\u2019t to standard. \\n\r\nOther mentionable characters include the detective Kurahashi who by the end of the show came to see the light of Sphinx\u2019s ideas. Five is the other mention as she was just\u2026 well pointless. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThe art was well done. From the scenes such as the motorcycle with twelve and Lisa to nine watching the nuclear bomb darken Japan. It was really beautiful. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nWow\u2026 There are few soundtracks that I\u2019ve listened to without the anime, but Terror in Resonance will probably take the grail. The stand out tracks for me includes Von and Bless. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: \\n\r\nTerror in Resonance is a beautifully portrayed anime about the life of two terrorists. Though controversial in name, the anime puts any doubt I had out of the window. Though this series has a few flawed characters is doesn\u2019t detract from the overall story. I challenge any other anime studios to make one as good as this on the controversial topic! \\n\\n\r\nOverall I give Terror in Resonance an 8.4/10 \\n\\n\r\nAlternate recommendations include the critically acclaimed Death note with its similarly cunning characters and Elfen lied with its dark nature and tragic backstory. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading guys, Have a nice day! \\n",

            "content": "This is my first review on here, so please forgive any mistakes and such I might make.\r\nI'll do my best to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but be wary of some minor ones before reading this review.\r\nI originally started watching Zankyou no Terror because I saw it in the recommended section for a few other series that I like and after reading the synopsis and seeing a few images from the show, I thought it looked pretty promising. It also seemed to get good reviews, not just from anime fans, but on mainstream film and tv sites too. While I don't think Zankyouno Terror is particularly bad, I also don't think it deserves the amount of praise it seems to have gotten. This is due to the fact that despite an interesting premise, intriguing plot set up, and a really beautiful soundtrack, I feel it ultimately fails to deliver any lasting emotional impact for reasons I will now go into.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the premise of Zankyou no Terror seems to be quite an original one. I haven't seen any other anime series that are explicitely about terrorism and while I am sure that there are others out there, I can see why this premise would attract people to it. A story centred contemporary domestic terrorism has the potential to make for controversial and challenging viewing. The opening episodes also suggest that this is going to be the case, and that this is a show that will touch on a number of social issues (such as child abuse, mental illness, social exclusion, goverment corruption, etc). However, after the series concluded, the viewer is left with no clear messages or arguments concerning these issues, which is disappointing to say the least. The story seems more concerned with setting up the mystery behind the two main characters' (9 and 12's) motives and having the detective character (Shibazaki) solve it. While this has the potential to be exciting, and for the first few episodes, it does deliver in terms of tension and does the whole cat-and-mouse pursuit quite well, I feel the story ultimately could have been more ambitious in trying to give the viewer something to think about. 4/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art and animation for this show is overall very good. In particular, there is a beautiful scene in the final episode that takes place on a ferris wheel, with Tokyo lit up at night in the background. Watching only this scene, with the pretty animation and emotional music choice, it would be easy to see why this anime seems to be considered so highly.\\n\r\nThe character designs of the mains are also quite good, and while 5 looks a bit out of place amongst the others (who dress themselves in a more mainstream fashion), this fits her personality and makes her seem suitably eccentric and different from the other characters.\\n\r\nHowever, while the animation is well done, it didn't strike me as being particularly creative. Apart from the scene I mentioned previously, there aren't many that stand out visually. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nFor me, the strongest point of Zankyou no Terror was unquestionably the soundtrack. In particular the end theme ('Dare ka, Umi wo') and 'Von' stood out and I found myself listening to them outside of watching the show.\\n\r\nWhile I felt the occasional use of English dialogue in the show didn't really work, overall I liked the choice of voice actors and I thought their performances were well suited to their characters. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAs an anime with only 11 episodes, it makes sense that the series has a relatively small cast of main characters. I didn't feel overly attached to these characters, however, I also don't think they were particularly badly conceived. My main issue with them is that out of their respective storylines, the narrative only puts a large amount of focus on 9 and 12's, and to a lesser extent, Shibazaki's. While this would be okay in some stories, as these two are the main characters, it makes other character storylines seems undervalued and a bit pointless. For example, Lisa has a storyline and issues of her own that is opened up to the viewer over the course of the first few episodes. However, these are neglected in favour of the two cat-and-mouse chases that feature in the series. Perhaps, in a longer series, more attention and closure could be given to the other characters, but I feel this series puts to much emphasis on its two leads, at the cost of properly seeing through the narratives of Lisa and 5.\\n\r\nWhile most attention is given to 9 and 12, in terms of character building anyway, aspects of their personalities are left hanging as well. To give an example that isn't particularly spoiler-y, 12 mentions to Lisa early in the series that he has synesthesia and that this is one of the reasons as to why he finds her interesting to be around, since her voice is a very pleasant colour to him. This is (to my recollection) the last and only direct mention of this aspect of him, which feels rather like a lost opportunity considering the medium Zankyou no Terror takes place in and that characters with synesthesia seem to be very rare in popular culture. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAs I said in my opening, I didn't actively dislike this series. At only 11 episodes, it was fairly watchable and it's not a series I regret seeing. If nothing else, it introduced me to some nice music and it did have a strong opening and an interesting premise.\\n\r\nHowever, I wouldn't recommend it to others because of the flaws I have mentioned in my review. I also don't see myself rewatching it. I feel like for a show that had a lot of potential, it fails to deliver and this can be disappointing when watching the plot draw to a close. The ending was underwhelming and I didn't find it particularly emotionally effective, due to weaknesses in the story and pacing up to that point, and a lack of any strong message throughout. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIf you like anime that have modern and aesthetically polished animation, cat-and-mouse type storylines, and memorable music, then you may like Zankyou no Terror. On the other hand, if you are looking for an anime that is emotionally deep and politically relevant and intellectually challenging, then Zankyou no Terror is probably not for you. 6/10",

            "content": "TL;DR Not for those who are affected by terrorism in any way\r\nWatching Terror in Resonance is a bit like reliving the horrible event that happened in NYC.  Sure, many movies and pop culture has reference to that tragic day, but nothing quite resemble what Terror in Resonance did, at least in its first act.\r\nMIXED - Story\r\nIn essence, Terror in Resonance is a detective story.  But instead of watching a lone wolf detective trying to bust his balls chasing criminals who are always one step ahead, we are treated with a cat-and-mouse chase.  We know who the culprits are early on and weknow what they are up to.  But we don't know why they are the way they are and why they did the things they did.  This is where the anime gets interesting.\\n\\n\r\nTerrorism is such a sensitive topic in our real world society right now, yet the creators of this anime is not afraid to bring it to the forefront of our minds.  This is not for those who still think they are affected by any form of terrorism in any way, shape or form, be it 9/11, Charlie Hebdo or Boko Haram.  It is graphical, even though no deaths are involved, at least none that has been reported (but that does not mean it's victimless).  It's a bit like the IRA back in the last century when the police was warned before the bombs went off.\\n\\n\r\nIn Terror in Resonance, the terrorists (two teenagers who called themselves Sphinx) forewarn the authority by the way of a video uploaded to the internet.  They give out a puzzle about the location of the explosive device and leave the cops to figure out where.  The first terrorist act that they performed is very much akin to the 9/11 tragedy.  The settings might be different, but the impact is just the same.  There were no casualties, but one of the towers of the government building in the Shinjuku district was destroyed.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses, the terrorists put their crafts in places that cause mayhem.  However, there is a conflict of interest here.  On one hand, their goal is to disrupt daily lives by blowing things up, but on the other, they actually do not want to cause fatality.  Sure, you can disrupt lives without killing, but why threaten to blow up something in a crowded area when you are not actually planning to go through it, knowing that the end result have a high probability of causing death?\\n\\n\r\nOn the other end is the cops who, despite mobilising a huge amount of resources, seems to be helpless.  In come Shibazaki, a demoted cop who happens to be really good at investigating these sort of things.  He is the driver who solve the riddles being raised by the terrorists.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole series gives off this \"Ghost In The Shell\" vibe about it.  It is dark, sinister and mysterious.  However, it doesn't provoke any deep thinking in the same way GITS might.  In the end, it is a story about how the cops chase down a bunch of teenagers who happen to know a lot of stuff about blowing things up.\\n\\n\r\nGOOD - Characters\\n\\n\r\nFor every good crime thriller, there must have some well thought-out characters who support the script.  Luckily, Terror in Resonance offers a bunch of different, if not all interesting, group of individuals.\\n\\n\r\nNine is the mastermind of the entire terror operation.  He is calculated, calm and logical.  Twelve forms the second half of their little terror outfit.  He is playful, daring and lot more cheerful than his counterpart.  The third member to join them inadvertently is Lisa Mishima, a klutzy girl who runs away from her troubled mother and the bullies from school.  She ends up staying with the Sphinx pair and is the source of some light hearted moment in an otherwise dark anime.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other side of the fence is Shibazaki, the lone cop who actually cares about the motive behind all the terrorist attacks in a time when the rest of the police force only care about how to stop the terrorists.  He is later joined by a hot headed partner who initially rejects the Shibazaki way, but eventually comes around.  Sadly, this pair sounds too much like a cliche pair of Hollywood cops.\\n\\n\r\nGetting in the middle of it all is Five, a super intelligent girl from the FBI who seems to be somehow related to Nine and Twelve.  Sadly, she proves to be the weakest link in the series with her outlandish personality and a somewhat ridiculously childish plot to stop the terror by, wait for it, causing more terror.\\n\\n\r\nThere is not much character development in the show, but luckily the show is not character driven.\\n\\n\r\nMIXED - Graphics\\n\\n\r\nThe attention to details is nothing short of perfection.  From the computer screen (which looks remarkably like Windows / Mac) to the explosion, everything is in its place.  The character design fits the character in question.  The cheerful Twelve wears outgoing casual weekend wear while Nine is more conservative in is choice of clothing.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the art style is not to everyone's taste.  The creators use hard solid lines, everyone seems to be suffering from vitamin D deficiency.  They are all so pale and lack skin tone.  You can hardly find any soft colour in the series and everything is dark and heavy.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the graphics in Terror is more of a personal taste than anything.  Some might be put off by the lack of warm colour, while others would praise the aesthetic approach that the creators took.\\n\\n\r\nBAD - OP/ED\\n\\n\r\nI will probably burn in hell for this.  But I, for one, did not like the OP and ED of Terror in Resonance.  I cannot pinpoint the one thing that I didn't like about it, but the songs sound rough and unrefined.  I know that some viewers would love it.  The one exception is the final slow melody that is vastly different from the other songs.\\n\\n\r\nPlease feel free to disagree.\\n\\n\r\nGOOD - Music / Sound\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM to the anime is much better.  The music is cheerful relative to the artistic direction that Terror has taken.  It's much more soothing than the OP/ED.  The sound is also well done.  Explosions, helicopters, trains, gun shots, everything mixes well with the environment.  It really feels as if you were there.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nTerror in Resonance is an anime that provoke.  Whether it's the artistic style, the theme or the plot, it would make some viewers uncomfortable.  That said, the series is by no mean more sinister than your average crime thriller.  You might not feel for the two teenagers.  After all, they are committing a crime, regardless of motive.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is intense and interesting to watch.  Characters are, in the majority of cases, an ensemble that support each other to tell a story.  Art and sound are areas up for debate.  There are some rough edges, but in the overall scheme of things, Terror in Resonance is enjoyable to watch.",

            "content": "This is my first review on MAL, so please be easy one me ;)\r\n**This may contain some spoilers...\r\nStory: 10\r\nZnT has a highly original plot, standing out from the clinches filling the anime world these days. Why, well, it's about terrorist for screaming out loud! And not just terror in the name! Pretty dark, yes. Quite satirical, too. It might not strike you as unique at first. But don't let the poster (whatever you call it) fool you that this is yet another high school filler-filled show.\r\nThis is about teen terrorists who blend in a high school during the day and secretly plant terror attacks againstthe evil govt, but their lives at school are rarely mentioned in this show. If you are, like me, no-nonsense filler-hater, you will definitely love it! \\n\\n\r\nThe characters' backgrounds are even more interesting. The terrorists have their (psychological and ulterior) motives. Even the unlucky girl has an unfortunate dysfunctional family life. You will learn to understand (and maybe sympathise with) 'these' terrorists a little if not a lot.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of revealing all the information at once, the plot slowly and gracefully unfolds. Giving pieces of jigsaw and hints little by little, putting you on the edge of your seat. I even fell for some of their red herrings! I love how every incident and minute thing would connect in the end!\\n\\n\r\nThe tactics and science in this show is incredibly realistic and relatively sophisticated, but not too complicated for laymen like me to understand (cough*mahou*cough*koukou*cough*) \\n\\n\r\nEven though there are only 11 episodes, this show manages to pull off with out too many plot holes and end beautifully unlike most 10-something-episode shows these day.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I think the CG is top-notch. I am pleased with how characters look! Not to OOT but not too plain (with the exception of Lisa).\\n\\n\r\nThey also have this summer theme background. The vast blue sky and summer sun. It is visually stunning. Breathtaking. Powerfully beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThe scenery has even the most minute details. I remember a cop's house scene was filled with child's toys in vivid details!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and background music are undoubtedly great, suspenseful and corresponding with the mood of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED suits the story well though personally I didn't find them that catchy or memorable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nI adore both Nine and Twelve. And I don't usually like more than one character! They have no superpower, but superhuman brain power. Strangely, they manage to keep me glued to the desktop all day. Oh, and, that Twelve's psychotic smile! I even like the investigator and Five!\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I find quite illogical is how rapidly and drastically Twelve changes because of Lisa. But it's true that he shows some interests (and care?) in her since very early on. Would that be counted as a problem with character development?  \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis is definitely masterpiece anime. Educational, suspenseful and worthwhile spending your time. Definitely not a run-of-the-mill crap.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I am not a fan of shows with no supernatural/ special powers, but I still enjoy this one very much and would definitely recommend it!\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nOriginal and great anime! Fantastic art and sound. Enjoyable plot and characters. Highly recommended for those who like no-nonsense, unique and critical shows. Well, even if you like fillers or a bit of spice-of-life, it's still worth watching!",

            "content": "Over the past eleven years of my short time on Earth, I have been watching anime. Sometimes it's something I haven't seen before. And other times it is something I have watched countless times. And when I watch all of these countless series and films, I think about how similar they all are. From the characters, to the sounds, the story, the setting, and the eb & flow. Not once have I ever considered an anime to be a perfect 10/10. I am no professional anime reviewer, I'm merely a fan who watches anime for their deep messages and personal enjoyment. But Zankyou no Terrorhas left me in a state of complete catharsis.\\n\\n\r\nAs I sat in my chair following the end of the shows eleven episode run, I was speechless. I was left thinking and thinking. I told myself \"It can't be over. Not yet...\" But it was over, and all I could do was sit there and ponder the very clear message that this series had left me with. As a writer, I was deeply moved by this short story. And while the odds of a continuation are next to zero... no... it is zero. And as much as I would love for there to be more, I can't in good conscience say that there has to be. Left as it is, Zankyou no Terror(Terror in Resonance) is a masterpiece. Perhaps not everyone views it quite like I do. In fact if they are reading this review, they're probably laughing their asses off, possibly pointing out where the series had flaws. But those flaws, to me, are quite insignificant.\\n\\n\r\nOver the course of the series I fell in love with the characters, I cared for them, and when it was all said and done, I wanted to shed a tear for them. They were far more than skin deep. The show constantly reminded me that these kids have a past that no one should want to have. They've been through hell and back and it is that hell that has made them into the people we see in this series. They develop, not as characters, but as people. This journey was conveyed through beautiful artwork and a soundtrack the likes of which I have never heard. The dialogue, while perhaps not flawless, was nonetheless understandable and did not detract one bit from the story. The voice acting on the other hand, particularly the American characters, could quite frankly use a LOT of work. But that is to be expected of people whose first language is not English. \\n\\n\r\nThe world of Zankyou no Terror is identical to our own, and the art style emphasizes this realism. And it is because of this realism that the story of Zankyou no Terror becomes far more personal. Our world is far from perfect, and there are things that our governments do that they would be condemned for if it weren't for the utmost secrecy and corruption. Times have indeed changed. Those who would once be called heroes, are now labeled terrorists for standing up against their corrupt government. And the public is none the wiser because the government told them they were terrorists. And so what do the terrorists do? They make you listen. And they give you... VON\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one emotion that Zankyou no Terror keeps hidden under its belt, it would be loneliness and the desire to be needed, the desire to be heard, and the desire to feel alive. It takes no more than a single person, man or woman, child or adult, to instigate an era of change. To create a better future for those that succeed us. To ensure that the mistakes of the past are never repeated. All it takes is a single person who wants people to remember... that they lived.\\n",

            "content": "Terror in Resonance:\r\nMINDSET:\r\nExplosions, derpy faces, amazing animation and overly hyped. Its devoid of realism and don't think outside the box...\r\nREVIEW:\r\nAccording to Collins dictionary terrorism is:\r\nThe systematic use of violence and intimidation to achieve political ends.\r\nBy using this evidence, do I remember any casualties from innocent civilians? No. Even if You may think that there were at least some deaths during the show, they never had the courtesy to at least show some death sequences or just anyone dying as if everyone was plot armoured, and when we do gotten to do the point when people are dying, it felt cheap as if the writers nevernoticed they should even have casualties.\\n\\n\r\nSo even the show that centres around \u201cTerrorism\u201d looks and centres more around just blowing sh*t up. It was obvious right from the get go that the two protagonists needed to launch a nuclear bomb at Tokyo, Consequently, right at the first few minutes of the Anime, we see them successfully stealing plutonium without getting caught and instead of even planning to create a nuclear bomb but all what they did was screw around with the police with riddles and demolishing a couple of skyscrapers without even killing anyone!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter motives are just way too value or feels like it happened for no reason at all. Like why are these people terrorists in the first place? Seriously, You cannot really link up why and how this whole terrorism thing even started! Their were characters who barely get any fleshing out and feel like backdrop. Like the police force who seem to have an important role to the plot yet the show has never really felt that these supporting roles have a larger meaning or have good character exploration for us to even care! The side cast was completely forgettable as one guy only speaks English in the most Asian way possible and who even cares about such people or anyone in that matter?\\n\\n\r\nPlot device characters are surprisingly everywhere in the Anime, but even if the role was there and the character is grasped well, how can we care? No one ever develops as if we were to show our sympathy at the end. Token girl of the two terrorists was unnecessary, she doesn\u2019t have a role to the plot, she doesn\u2019t even help out the characters emotionally or physically and we never even knew why she's so emo in the first place, since all what she does is look sad! Overall, the cast was an absolute train wreck.\\n\\n\r\nSure before the unholy revival of the 5th episode it did felt like a good show with how it handles the story. Of course society mass panicked from the extreme vandalism, the police was actually doing something. Though the riddles that the terrorists set up were just plain silly like trying to figure out some cryptic Greek myth to find some number that will lead the police force to enemy HQ  felt more hip and cool like a beta version of Death Note. Yes, characters were still terrible at that time, but it seem to contain more self-awareness any ways.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the show attempts to create some epic revelation twist as a pathetic attempt to blow everyone\u2019s mind, it feels more like stuff being made up along the spot rather than something that feels organic. In this one moment when we reveal the master mind whose behind through most of the weird causes in the show we instead found that it was just one of the detectives friend who committed suicide... Yeah, epic revelation guys I sure had an asthma attack after that one...\\n\\n\r\nAt this fifth episode we see the show completely collapsing  into itself when he reveal a psycho chick whose only personality is just to be a Yandere, but also: We some of the most asian and most downright cheesiest and the most unmoralistic use of \u201cEngrish\u201d in  a damn while! I know these people are meant to be American and this Asian Psycho has to speak English for them to understand, but its still a thousand times better just to leave all of those scenes in just Japanese; I can't help but to utterly face palm and feel ear raped every time I hear it! \\n\\n\r\nThough that is not the biggest of my issues, its when the show decided to hit the mind blow fest, and throw in a bunch of random details of the story that don't add up to anything, and even if it does somehow make sense, it still felt cheap or more importantly some random sh*t where supposed to care about, but ends up being pretentious. As if it was so cheap for the reason why psycho chick was psycho was because she was drugged in school. Can't I ever be more uncaring for such a plot device?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, for something that is meant to be some intense mystery thriller, its horrible, since we don't care about the characters and too many of them feeling like a plot device or just there for absolutely f**k all. The show is classified as \u201cGOOD\u201d until you pass episode 5, and I did enjoy it for what its worth in a certain extent. Consequently, the show ends up not being bad, but another mediocrity because of that factor alone.\\n\\n\r\nSince I never cared about the show, fans were trying to speak at how this show has a \u201cPolitical Message\u201d yes, even if its excactly true on whatever the show tries to conceptualise, like how making a school for uber smart people so they can farm their genes that will save the needless problems in Japanese society, was presented  too subtlety! Yes they somehow vaguely explained it, but even if it was obvious, the reasons just don't really feel natural, and is more of a pretentious arse pull! And even if the message was handled well enough for us to get it, I still cant help but to not care, due to badly directed characters and story.\\n\\n\r\nMAPPA is one of those Animation companies that don't really make the best kind of Animation, well its either mediocre or above average, and they did Animated Hajime No Ippo for whatever that fighting show is worth. Any ways, it was very clear that MAPPA allowed there Animators some fun and creative freedom while still dumping cash bags of savings to make some of the most consistent and well made backgrounds. There is this feeling when there\u2019s a lack of CGI, which is always a plus side and despite of them using a lot of greys, it does make a nift contradiction with some bright colours thrown in whenever someone is outside. The character designs still range to pretty good, or just plain cheap! Like one of the police men having massive eyes and how he's part of the supporting cast. However, most of them give this feeling to synchronize with the whole themes of the show regardless if it was presented badly. How the camera just moves a bit from time to time for no apparent reason is a nice touch, and there were moments like the Ferris Wheel scene when I just want to feel at least some emotion just because it was choreographed so well. Clearly, there has been a lot of thought put into this.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST has a strange vibe to it feeling rather unfitting for this kind of show, but it somehow blends well with the whole terrorist thing with crazy visuals. They do use mainstream instruments like the guitar and piano to an extent, but my main issue is that its just too ambitous for me to gladly listen to on a structured basis. It is an OST that feels very odd, it gives You this bizarre, yet somewhat emotional impact. It is clearly one of those OST's that You need to listen by Yourself to get the gist of what people say about it. The OP, does fit in well with the OST, and sure it doesn\u2019t get me excited, but the visual choreography is just a creative use for us to get into a weird mood. The ED is skip worthy, but it is very calm if You'd like to listen to it.\\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nIts always going to be the Animation of how people will remember such an over hyped mediocrity. Its always going to be the damn budget that I will forever remember on how aesthetically  pleasing it was. Even if everyone says that its good, I believe it won't be long until more and more people will cough up to downgrade the overall score...\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\n2.5/10 \u2013 The characters have nothing but to fill a one or two dimensional personality, and some of them are complete plot devices or just there or no reason.\\n\r\n4/10 \u2013 Its cool just to see the it until episode 5, when the story being on of the redeeming factors collapses into itself.\\n\r\n8.5/10 \u2013 A great mix of very creative choreography and a crazy budget that stays consistent.\\n\r\n7/10 \u2013 The music is refreshing from the common OST, but its a bit too bizarre for me.\\n\r\nFINALE: 5.5/10 \u2013 Its a lousy piece of sh*t if it wasn\u2019t for the budget.",

            "content": "(Warning: Spoilers)\r\nZankyou no terror is the perfect example of a train wreck. Every episode of this show got worse and worse and the writing was completely terrible with bland characters and no sense of development in terms of the narrative or world building.\r\nWhile the anime is very well directed featuring amazing artwork, animation and a great musical score that does a decent job at immersing you into its world, what is the point if the script is terrible? Its a shame too, since the first couple of episodes were generally interesting but never developed anything past that point and everything felt rushed. The main premiseof the show caught my attention, be it as it was about terrorism, an idea not really presented too much in anime and certainly stands out as an idea than your typical cute girls doing cute things shows, but many people gave the show a high score based solely on the premise rather than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nAnother reason for that was because of the highly influential director working on this anime too. He does a good job at directing the material he was given, and if this show does have something going for it, it probably was Watanabe Shinichiro's involvement. However, no good amount of great directing can save an ultimately broken narrative. \\n\\n\r\nThe main two characters are both boring, dull and lack any kind of development. They both come across pretentious and stupid, both in their actions and in their goal as well, which they keep so god damn vague. Their actions and reasons for it just seemed too silly.  The whole thing felt like two children playing a game, sending riddles to the police and what not instead of any actual terrorism. There is no political statement behind the attacks and most of the people seem more so confused about the attacks rather than scared.\\n\\n\r\nThe riddles themselves seemed far too easy since they were all based on all ready existing myths and the such, but no one could figure them out aside from one detective. Even if this were the case, why not ask the population of Japan for help, or better yet the world, since the videos were uploaded onto YouTube. In this case, the riddles would be a breeze and they would be solved easily. Hell, people in the comments and such would be trying to figure it out themselves so it feels kind of unrealistic how the riddles keep throwing everyone off. The way the main cop comes to the discovery of the riddle is by dumb luck, and makes the entire show feel like a Saturday morning kid's cartoon. There is tones of lazy information dumping as if the audience is retared and can't interpret anything for ourselves, and most characters pull ideas from their asses.\\n\\n\r\nHalf way through the series they introduce a new villain who is called \"Five\" and god, it's been so long since I have seen such a badly written and pointless character. Every scene she was involved in felt like filler and none of it was ever interesting. She keeps on remarking about how she wishes to beat 9 but when she is able too, she kills herself instead. Why? Fuck knows. This character is given a terrible motivation which is never explained to us ever and never expanded on either. We waste so much on this character, which could of been used to flesh out the rest of the cast, but nope.\\n\\n\r\nLisa was simply a fucking plot device. Every action she took was just to advance the plot in the most laziest way possible. Her actions and decisions were stupid and dumb, making her feel less like a character and more so a cheap way to push the story forward whenever it was necessary. Her motivation to act as a terrorist were weak, the subplot with her being bullied and her mother becoming obsessed with her are never developed at all and the anime expects us to buy into the relationship between her and 12 but since both characters are boring, why should I give a fuck?\\n\\n\r\nThe only slightly interesting character was the main detective, but even then, he is nothing to write home about. I understand that both 12 and 9 are emotionally destroyed and that's why their characters act the way they do but they never do anything with these themes and ideas. Their motives are revealed to us far too late for the audience to care or to get invested in and their backstories are so boring and generic, I didn't care at all. You need to do more with your characters to get the audience to sympathise with them than a simple tragic backstory. They need to be appealing in some way. Lisa is given some characterisation in the fact that she can't cook, but this trait is so common in characters that it feels uninteresting. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending was the most cheap and bullshit thing I have ever seen. We are presented with a three minute slide show of the three characters having fun together, playing and enjoying their friendship to try to make you feel something for these characters and pull at the heart strings before 12 is shot dead. What cheap, lazy writing. The fact that they try to make you feel something at the very end for these three characters they've barely spent developing and then relying on shock factor felt so lazy.\\n\\n\r\nThere were a few things I really did enjoy about the show however. Some of the scenes did a great job at conveying how the characters were feeling through the music and animation and these scenes (particularly the one with Lisa and 12 on the motorcycle) was great. Some of the animation could look pretty great too but that ultimatily means nothing if the script is so bad.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Zankoyu no terror was a disappointment. As someone who never watched it while it was airing and having people hail it as \"the greatest show ever\" for the past two years, Zankyou no terror felt boring and dull. Now, if you liked this anime, that's fine. I really don't care, more power to you. I just felt it was bad. Really bad.\\n\r\n(Please don't kill me)",

            "content": "When i heard about this anime, i said to myself : Wow an anime about terrorism .. it must be great ! \r\nFirstly i was thinking about a population (Japan of course) being attacked by terrorists and we would see them experiencing it.. experiencing an terrorist attack. Well sorry but this anime isn\u00b4t about it. \r\nI really got disappointed with this show, somehow, with terrorism, they managed to pull off some clich\u00eas .. seriously .. There are things in this anime that seem a big waste of time.. \r\nStory: 7/10. The initial concept was fine. A nice idea actually.. but then .. well then thingshad to get worst. It starts doing some questionable things to the plot. One of them is how they manage to get in some places .. i would love to tell you but i won\u00b4t otherwise i would be spoiling, but the plot isn\u00b4t explained properly, a lot of questions were left without an answer plus some \"fails\" on the plot only makes it worst. \\n\\n\r\nThey decided to do a whole thing with only 12 eps and it went wrong. Basically this anime is about a group of \"terrorists\" (who watched the anime will understand the quotation marks) who starts to attack Japan. After an attack, that group meets a girl who had serious troubles with her life.. \\n\\n\r\nDespite of those problems that i talked about, this anime is still engaging and fun to watch. There are some moments that can put you on the edge of your sit and that is really an important thing. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10. The art is fine. Both the background and the character design are fine. Nothing really outstanding but still good enough. The pallet used is really interesting one. They made a mix between dark and bright colours which gave some sort of beauty to the anime overall. If there is a problem with the art, is the character design. They are good, but not great. The characters look flat. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10. The opening is nice but i couldn\u00b4t enjoy it. I skipped every single episode. Maybe is my personal taste but i really felt that this opening is not a big thing. The tracks used are fine. Nothing memorable or epic, just fine. I think that they don\u00b4t add anything to the anime, they are just there to fill in. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10. The biggest problem was the decision making. Is not rare seeing a questionable choice here. I always asked myself : Why is she/he doing it? Would she/he really behave like that before such situation? I guess not .. it seemed not natural. \\n\\n\r\nThe develop is weak. We can\u00b4t see much of them. Basically we only know their motives and what they wanted to do. I can\u00b4t describe you the characters because i just don\u00b4t know them. They are not original. Nothing new here, everything that I saw here I had already seen it elsewhere but better. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10. Like i said, despite all of those problems, Zankyou no Terros is still a engaging anime. Personally i loved the end, really heart touching. Meanwhile, the middle episodes were boring at some point. I didn\u00b4t like them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10. I reccomend this anime. Even though it has nothing new to show, the ending is good so I think it worth it's time.",

Now let's start with the individual ratings.\r\nStory: Rebelling against a system and fighting for your rights is quite the common theme in a lot of anime, nothing new on that and a lot of anime have done justice to it, Zankyou no terror does the same. Wonderful take on the Governmental system of not only Japanbut also to a lot of systems from different parts of the world. The story gradually starts off with an act of terrorism, then turns out that it was done for the purpose of attention, for the reason of seeking salvation, now isn't that a good execution! The flow of the story is really nice, short and precise. All in all wonderful presentation so 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The character designs are well done, the animation is of superb quality and the effects are excellently done. So 8/10 again.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: Another great album from Yoko Kanno, it's just so beautiful. The soundtracks ooze with serenity and peacefulness, except few tracks which were having a hip feeling to them which are quite nice too. So a solid 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The character development of all the main and supporting characters flow at a smooth gradual phase, but could've been a bit more dynamic, there were a few dull moments but altogether the interaction between them is shown well. So, 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I loved it. 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.2.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Well then shit son this anime is just for you. \r\nCharacters: Characters are well developed, you learn their back story, why they're doing what they're doing, and how they evolve over time.  For an 11 episode anime, this probably is a top tier example of how to introduce your characters.\r\nArt: Looks good. Feels good. Mashes together well with every scene. Top-notch animation.\r\nSound: One of the better examples of great soundtracks for an anime. It uses orchestrated music, music from actual musicians, all with different flavors. Instead of those poorly edited MIDIsoundtracks you normally get, most of the music within the show is actually pretty standalone and sets the mood nicely within the show.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Makes sense. Is realistic and it can apply to everybody so there is no \"THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE THIS\" shenanigans like most fiction oriented shows. Every character has their own motive, story, and reasons for their actions which all mashes up into a beautiful orgy of well directed plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Good shit. I loved the ending, but out of all the really well organized shots, and really no missteps with direction, I felt a little unsatisfied with it. The ending was fine, but it just missed a certain impact which would have left a better taste in my mouth.",

Zankyou no Terror revolves around the post events of a failed experiment that gathered intellectually gifted orphans from all around the Japan to make a medicine that would excel human brain further. With clever plot design and extraordinary voice acting, this anime is bound to grip you tight. It is one of the anime which will keep kicking you back to your seat either with its mixof cheeky and smart characters or mind blowing scenes. Compile all that with a good amount of thought provoking canon puzzles and blasts; you get a great anime.\\n\\n\r\nI will not be exaggerating if I say characters from Zankyou no Terror are some of the most interesting ones not only from this season but maybe a past few. Two young smart rebels, Nine and Twelve, who happen to come across a rather airhead and slow-wit girl Lisa. I can't help but point out to her character she is just adorable, and I don't say that a lot. And of course no character list is complete without that one antagonist we all hate, Five, I wouldn't spoil much but damn it is fairly rare to come across an antagonist like her. \\n\\n\r\nAll that with a great mix of original soundtrack and beautifully drawn art. You'll not feel the passage of time when you watch this anime. \\n\\n\r\n-HIGHLY RECOMMENDED-\\n\\n\r\nPros : \\n\r\n+ Clever thought provoking plot\\n\r\n+ Bombs Bombs Bombs! \\n\r\n+ Smart side-characters, smarter antagonist, smartest MCs\\n\r\n+ That ending.\\n\\n\r\nCons : \\n\r\n - A lot of scenes feel rushed \\n\r\n - That ending...",

            "content": "The anime has many positives and shortcomings, and I'll list a few (impossible to list all without spoiling the anime) in this short and spoiler free review.\r\nFirst off, the things that I loved:\r\n1. The soundtrack. Surprisingly beautiful.\r\n2. The fact that his anime did not feel to go the ecchi, teenage rom-com or yaoi way (the most popular categories these days). Instead, it took head on a very serious topic.\r\n3. Consistency. I mean, barring the plotholes, the anime was fairly consistent in its theme.\r\n4. The time when 9 disarms a bomb. The music simply added to the beauty of the scene.\r\n5. The pacing of the show,which picked up in the last 4 episodes. Had quite a few minor and major twists as well.\\n\r\n6. The ending. Sad, but beautiful. It made me up my score from 7 to 8.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe things that I didn't like:\\n\r\n1. 2 dimensional characters. All of them fit into a stereotypical character type. ALL of them.\\n\r\n2. Lisa. Why is she even in the anime? Her only job is to sob, cry, doubt herself, be a weakling, mutter sorry, be a hurdle and be completely useless. I don't see why the animators felt the need to add such a stupid character in this series. She was nothing more than a plot device and easily replaceable by someone more likeable.\\n\r\n3. Why Lisa thinks it's okay to spend time with terrorists. WHAT girl in her right mind would think that?\\n\r\n4. Why does the main detective have such an extensive knowledge of Greek mythology?\\n\r\n5. How the F was 5 allowed to go ahead with her very, very dangerous plan at the airport terminal?\\n\r\n6. The flashbacks - too little, too late. \\n\r\n7. 5's arc. I don't think anybody understood why she did what she did in the end.\\n\r\n8. Why did the boys have to resort to such *extreme* measures to do what they did?\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, though, this is a good anime to watch, provided you accept it has flaws. And to be honest, which anime doesn't?",

            "content": "From the very beginning, I thought that this anime was going to have one or two cool aspects in it and that would be it. A friend of mine even recommended this anime several times but I still didn't bother to watch it. Then I saw a certain review, pretty positive one actually, that stated that this would be a great candidate for best anime of the year. After seeing some footage I became interested in the anime and of course, gave it a watch.\r\nGoddamn was I missing on something. Now I don't think that Zankyou No Terror is a masterpiece but it certainly issomething every anime enthusiast who would like something deep and highly entertaining, should watch. \\n\r\nBeginning with the story, I think is a really interesting one, with all the terrorism stuff and even some aspects that reminded me of Death Note, my all time favorite anime. The ending is something really special, I didn't see it coming and it was pretty heartwarming. \\n\r\nLet's talk about the characters here, starting with the protagonists, Nine and Twelve, which are actually the terrorists themselves. I didn't expect them to be so enjoyable. Now, I didn't found them to be the badass dudes that I though they were going to be, they are pretty badass but the human aspects of them were the ones I didn't expect from these two to be so enjoyable. So yeah, really good main leads.\\n\r\nThere's this female character, named Lisa, which I didn't hate or anything but I didn't like her that much either. She's just\u2026 there the whole time. She could've been handled better. Another cool character here is this member of the police named Shibazaki, he is really damn smart and a lot of fun seeing him deduce sh*t. Overall, I found the characters really enjoyable and I liked every single one of them. Well, except a certain female character (not Lisa)\u2026\\n\r\nI found the music really damn good, I wouldn't categorize it as memorable but it is really good at setting the tone for the scenes and all that. Though I'm not a fan of the opening song, I can say that the rest of the soundtrack is really good. The voice acting I found to be pretty good as well. Nothing else to say here.\\n\r\nThe animation. Oh God the animation. The phrase fitting here is: \"top notch\". I mean, this looks like a motion picture! It was really impressive and of course, a lot of fun. The designs themselves, well\u2026 The environments look excellent, and the explosions and those kind of effects too. The character design\u2026 well is this kind of realistic design that I have to get used to but I'm sure that's just me.\\n\r\nOverall, Zankyou No Terror is a pretty awesome anime with a lot of cool and deep stuff. The characters were great, the story was good, the animation was awesome,... you should definitely give it a try. \\n",

The quality of the animation easily trounces most every anime MOVIE, and among anime themselves it's hard to think of anything that even compares. \r\nThe premise is likely to be the second - a thrillingly new idea in an age where such things are worth more than gold. Two teen-age terrorists, known only as Nine and Twelve, are the centre of this present-era Tokyo tale; the story quickly enchants as it tells of their insidious plots. The back-story of our two anti-heroes does, sadly, leave something tobe improved upon; one reaches the end of the anime without fully understanding just why Nine and Twelve are perpetuating this crime. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this, Zankyou no Terror is absolutely phenomenal - anyone who enjoys a darker plot with excellent pacing will love this anime.",

            "content": "Honestly, this is another anime that does so well in the first few episodes, then disregards everything, turning in to something entirely different.\r\nI'm going to keep this review short to avoid spoilers, not that there are many.\r\nFrankly, the entire anime bar episodes 1 and 2 is just poor, the fact that the only character that isn't one dimensional or a plot device is a background character is just poor.\r\n It leaves the other characters as obvious anime cliche's, from generic cold serious glasses guy to happy go lucky has no idea about social interaction teen. They're either bland and boring or so over the topthat it destroys the 'realism' in the anime, this for me is one of the biggest problems, such a fresh and good idea for a story to be paired with such unrealistic cookie cutter characters. There is no one to connect with, to feel for, to even like!\\n\\n\r\nOf course it's not just the characters that let the anime down, almost everything involved let's the anime down. \\n\\n\r\nEDIT:\\n\r\nTurns out I was wrong about the motives, they are revealed and wow...whilst the motive isn't particularily bad it's the fact that the motive is dependent on another character, if he wasn't involved then it never would've been found.\\n\r\nI feel they could've done a lot better with this, leaving references for the society would've done but instead it's done in a ridiculous way. I'd like to write a lot more about the motives but it's hard without spoiling anything\\n\\n\r\nThe more it tries to do, the messier it gets and soon enough, you're not even watching an anime about Terrorism.\\n\r\nThis is only made worse by sub-plots that are set up and never resolved or even seen again, they begin and...they begin, nothing more to them aside from unanswered questions.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some good points though! The music is all round decent, there's nothing particularily catchy or memorable but it helps to set the mood and does a far better job of it than the characters do.\\n\r\nThe art style is fantastic as well, whilst the personalities and types of characters are dreadful their actual designs are very realistic, and characters actually change clothes as well! The world they're in is highly detailed as well, from the roads and parks to the government buildings, it's all done well and looks real.\\n\\n\r\n I feel 'Zankyou No Terror' has tried to do too much, the best way to summarize it is 'Jack of all trades, master of none'. Everything in the anime is a huge contrast of something else, real world with a real problem coupled with over the top and unrealistic characters. An interesting premise with downright awful story telling unfinished sub-plots. Attempts to portray and battle real world issues are met with no resolve, climax or reasoning.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, it could've been good but much like the society and government it attempts to portray, you go a little deeper and realise how bad it is.",

            "content": "In a word, ZnT was disappointing. There was a lot of hype surrounding it, but it fell very short of my expectations. I did like the sound and art, but ZnT did not have either developed characters or a developed story. \r\nZnT had an interesting concept, but it's not novel. It's basically a newer and far less thrilling version of Urasawa Naoki's \"Monster\" (which, by the way, is excellent). ZnT is about mysterious teenagers with 'evil' plans for the rest of the world and the super-smart, fallen-from-grace adult who is trying to catch them. It could have been an excellent story, but the anime isunfortunately so riddled with cliches and 'surprising twists' that it lacks any real suspense. ZnT also only has 11 episodes, which may not seem like a lot, but each season of \"Free!\" only had 13 and each still managed to have a solid plot independent of the other.\\n\\n\r\nThese characters are incredibly superficial. You are introduced to one facet of their personality and never get to see more than that. I could probably forgive that for Nine and Twelve, because they, as the main characters, are given more screen time, but absolutely not for Five, and Lisa, to a lesser extent. Five was a completely useless character. To me, she added absolutely nothing to the overall plot and only served to extend the series to 11 episodes - without her, this anime could easily have been like 6 episodes. I didn't see her final plot twist coming, and not in a good way - I was so disappointed with her exit because she could have been a good supplement to the existing characters, but instead, she appeared and disappeared and nothing about the story changed. At all. I also would have liked to see more from and about Lisa (personal favourite, because she's the most 'human' to me). Shibazaki was decent, but he was like a more cliched version of Tenma (from Monster). Also, I refuse to believe that the police are as incompetent/arrogant/stubborn as they are portrayed to be. Really, you're going to keep ignoring this genius detective, multiple times, even though he's clearly proven himself to be very intelligent about these things? Yeah, no.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, ZnT is just very flat. There is nothing extraordinary about it; indeed, there are many, far superior manga and anime of the same genre. There are too many cliches, too many 'plot twists', too many dimensionless characters... That said, it's not awful. I think it could be the prototype, if you will, of a longer series that expands on the plot and characters, which could end up being interesting. So, if you're looking to kill a bit of time (each episode ~25 min) and don't particularly care about watching something amazing, then you'd probably enjoy this.",

For one, I picked up this anime and completed it within a couple of hours. \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe plot was captivating from beginning to end, with absolutely no filler or gray areas. I want to say more, but I'm not sure I should. All I will say is that if your into the \"Psychological Game-play\" genre, this is definitely worth a watch. Also, as I've noticed others have mentioned, this really isn't all about terrorism. But I'm sure you'll discover that for yourself when the time comes. \r\nArt: 10/10\r\nThe artwork was phenomenal. Therewere little to no areas that I could point out where the art was lazy, and the intentional  use of dark shading and pale colors for the characters was well played. Only specific scenes and objects (the sky, for example) were given vivid colorization, and with an underlying purpose. Additionally, it uses those gradients that animators love so much to throw in nowadays (usually into shoujo/comedy anime) but again, only in very specific situations, like in the characters irises, which I found interesting.\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI'm listening right now to the OST.  It's really nice, and the animation in the ending that goes with the ending song is just...sugoi. My favorite part about the soundtrack, though, is that when songs with lyrics are used, they aren't only Japanese--they're English and WAIT FOR IT--Icelandic! Which also ties into the plot (just made a revelation). This just keeps getting better and better.\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nOkay, to be honest, I didn't really pick up on this until reading other reviews, but the certain characters really aren't developed much at all. The reason why this didn't occur to me/why I don't care, is because it really wasn't relevant AT ALL to the story. \\n\r\nSOME SPOILERS, KINDA:\\n\r\nThe only characters whose backgrounds really mattered were Lisa (minimally), Twelve, Nine, and Five, and they were explained to an extent that made sense--at first, you know hardly anything about them, but that was how much the world knew about them. Their pasts were meant to be concealed. The only character that could have used more of a backstory was Shibazaki. They started to say things about his past, and just sort of dropped it.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nNo explanation. See above for details. (I mean, honestly, I enjoyed it to the extent that a series like this should be enjoyed, which is why I give it a 10/10)\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n10/10. Despite the tiny character development flaw, I found this to be so enjoyable and well made.",

I like her, she left me thinking Why? But if you really think about it her actions are not confusing.\\n\r\nLisa - A shy, oppressed girl. She doesn't exist until a few episodes in- Yes, I know she's in the 1st episode. It feels like she's just chucked in the batch to simply give problems to the real main characters- 9 & 12.\\n\\n\r\nRate: 7",

            "content": "This was an ambitious show and it tottered a little, but I enjoyed it. I promise, there's a reason why the protagonists are blowing stuff up. \r\nStory: \r\n- This is the struggle of young people who want to leave a bang on the world. I find such sentiments to be somewhat relatable, like something fished out of a half-lucid dream. The presentation of this message however, is a bit too melodramatic for me. The story feels immature, and I can almost feel the heartbeat of a young writer behind it (ie, is like me and hasn't experienced or reflected too much on the world). Ithink the story does a decent job considering how it is not an adaptation of a novel, light novel, or manga of previous renown. \\n\r\n- I didn't find the story very engaging; there are other shows that had me hooked from the first episode. I actually struggled to finish this show, and luckily it sped up a little around the 7th episode (or maybe that was just me. At some point I started to fast forward a few seconds at a time past the slower scenes). \\n\r\n- There was youthful struggle and political struggle; trials of friendship, trust, and morals. There were also many cultural references (or they're questionably implemented plot devices if you think too much about it). Like I said, ambitious, and it actually does an OK job of it. It definitely could have been less straightforward.\\n\r\n- Note: I'm a US kid speaking on a show targeting Japanese audiences, but I would say that US intervention is again being used as a major plot device. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n- Backgrounds and props were mostly amazing! Bright, vivid, extremely detailed. No cardboard sets to be found here, nope nope. That said, there are sometimes rather awkward transitions; I've seen better. The animation of the characters is not nearly at the same caliber as the set, and there are goofy moments here and there, but this is all to be expected from a show. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n- Ok some weird backstory: Personally I took up a recommendation, watched the first episode, took a break, found the soundtrack, ended up listening to it often, and then forced myself to finish the show. I have no regrets watching Zankyou no Terror; the use of music in the plot helped me to better appreciate the soundtrack.\\n\r\n- The point is, the soundtrack is nice ambiance as a standalone and is even more beautiful sitting in the laurels of a minimal plot and luscious images. For me, it held the show together and was crucial in making it palatable. The ending theme is definitely in my list of favorites. There's a conspicuous lack of the usual suspects in jrock and progrock; unusual for a thriller blow-stuff-up type show but it added to its deeper appeal. \\n\r\n- Note: it's unfair to be a native English speaker judging a show aimed at Japanese audiences, but I think there was pretentious overuse of heavily accented and choppy English, totaling to entire minutes of the show. (the only kudos goes to Clarence)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n- I wish the show did more to have us feel empathy for 9 and 12 through their history and upbringing. Where's the terror that gives birth to these little terrors? The show ends and does its job in tying up loose ends of motivations and such, but I still struggled to feel for why these crazy kids did what they did. \\n\r\n- And then there was a particularly questionable seeming character design cough five. She's a necessary plot twist, and plot twist again, but she was a bit of a prop (and an outrageously dressed one at that). \\n\r\n- And there's also someone who seemed to be totally out of the loop for the majority of the show cough cough Lisa. (idk, the moe factor doesn't really in here, aka, a 1 cours that has a lot to do and not a lot of time to do it)\\n\r\n- There's been better and there's been worse, though I would say that overall this show does a good job for the time it has to branch its characters. \\n\r\n- I was disappointed in the how the show addressed barriers between the younger and older generations, it's such a universal problem and the show suggested such a rift. I was also expecting more due to 9 and 12's lack of parent figures, and the in-depth and time consuming references to the stories of Oedipus.\\n\r\n- I've been watching enough anime to not really care (and American media villifies other cultures all the time), but the Big Baddie USA is again, a barely developed and conveniently placed set of characters and motivations.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\n- This show did make me cry, but I'm a bit of a crybaby anyhow so this isn't the \"stamp of tearworthy\" for all.\\n\r\n- Again, the show strikes a memory of passionately/manically/half-lucidly desiring to make an impact on the world. You know, like after waking up from a nap and finding that you're crying with the fading recollection of an existential confrontation in dreamland. I will be brooding over the show for a bit (and I'll think of the story and think about it some more when I listen to the soundtrack).\\n\r\n- Fact: I marathoned episodes 6-11. \\n\r\n- but I don't think this is has much rewatch value, and anyhow, the story already has faded/abridged itself into a long music video in my head. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI felt enough to write home about it seems, since I rarely write reviews.\\n\r\nArt and sound definitely a strong point of this show. This means that this is something to watch with the usual advice of ignorance is bliss: don't read too much into the meanings and feasibility of things if you want to simply enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nI really wish there could have been more character development (or more efficient of such), because I'm left with a strong desire to love the characters but not enough experiences with them to do so. But if it made me feel this way, it seems to be be a success for the 1 cours.",

            "content": "I was very excited at the prospect of a terrorism-themed show, considering how taboo and controversial a topic it is. However, while \"ZnT\" may have been fun to watch, it certainly didn't deliver on all aspects.\r\nThe Art and Sound are, honestly, the best thing about this show. The visuals, especially in the first episode, are stunning, and it's apparent there's a very large budget. The OST by Yoko Kanno is wonderful. OP is nice, ED is alright.\r\nCharacters are one of the two biggest problems with this show. THEY LACK BACKING AND DEVELOPMENT... While you can somewhat feel attached to them, due to us not totallyknowing WHY they are doing what they're doing (and then giving a shitty, under-developed reason as to why at the end -- but that's a story problem) certainly bogs down the steam. ...and then we have Five and Lisa: utterly simple (and/or useless) characters that are rather 2-dimensional. It's a shame the female characters are the ones that hurt the series the most... Only the detective seemed to really develop or get anything out of this entire story.\\n\\n\r\nSetting was your usual Japan... except under attack (and somewhat fleshed out).\\n\\n\r\nEpisodic value was good. I was excited to come back and see the show every week, but the episodes (especially the middle ones) had some pretty big holes that were never closed. Pacing was awkward near the middle as well. All this content backed into only 11 episodes... it really shows that they left stuff out that was important.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was a HUGE mess. While these actions are cool and daring, we never really learn of ANY [REALLY GOOD] reason they are being taken. I understand the premise that the writers were going for, but the lack of development on Nine and Twelve's backstory really made the ending reveal have a minimal impact. I want there to be MORE.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, \"Zankyou no Terror\" could have been a LOT better if there were more episodes in which they could flesh out full and complete character backstory and story development. It was fun to watch, but really wasn't that wonderful.",

            "content": "Story: \r\nThe story of ZnT is quite a serious one, with terrorists and all that. When you first start watching, you expect some sensitiveness toward the topic...well, you won't get it. ZnT starts off mysterious and right into the action and then slowly unravels all the secrets and mysteries. \r\nI really liked the background story and they managed, even though some parts are complicated, to keep it short, compact and entertaining with just the right balance between action and talking.\r\nArt: \r\nMaybe it didn't deserve the full 10 points...there were some parts which weren't drawn that good, but this is a score with priority to mylikes. I really like this kind of art so it's 10 points for me.\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are detailed enough and the characters are drawn well too. What I noticed: ZnT is an anime where the characters actually do change their everyday clothes...:D\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSoundtracks are always about what you like and dislike...I wasn't a big fan of the opening and ending, but that may just be me. The music and sounds during the anime were great though because it is not your usual Japanese songs or just some background sounds. They play with different songs and with this give different feelings to the anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nHere I can just congratulate. The staff of ZnT really managed to make you feel for the characters in just 11 episodes which in my opinion is quite amazing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching but I do have to say, this anime is probably not the right thing for everyone. Still I recommend it :D Also I didn't like some of the events in the story, so I just give it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\n10 points because it's not that often that I'm so mesmerized by an anime. ZnT isn't the typical anime and shows some new topics or perspectives. It also gives you interesting characters and enough action to not fall asleep, ever. \\n\\n\r\nI really recommend watching. If you like it after 2 to 3 episodes then it is something for you :D",

            "content": "Zankyou no terror is an anime that mixes thriller and drama. After looking at the reviews here and after seeing the design of it, I decided to give it a try. \r\nIt was a good anime. I think it had a great potential which was unfortunately hardly availed. It could have been a great anime, however it lacks of something.\r\nOn the positive side there is the enjoyable design. Each character has its own characteristics and not a single one looks like another one. Each character has a special aura that corresponds to their personality. Even better, the animation is really fluent. \r\nOn another plan, thedark atmosphere that englobes the anime from beginning to end suits the story really well and nothing is out of place in that sense. \\n\r\nOn the negative side, the story was good but wasn't profound enough. It isn't detailed enough. It seems that we are just rushing from one action to another with little phases of sentimentalism and reflection. \\n\r\nTo begin with I think that this anime should have been much longer and could at least have had 5 more episodes. It would have given more time to analyse and maybe better explanations on some things. In fact after seeing the whole thing I was quite disappointed since I waited for something much more deeper with such a story line. It now just looks like an empty story. The effects are great but the story and the characters lack of deepness. At the end there is no real message and the story in itself is really messy and we keep loosing track. There is no real direction which can be really confusing. There is no focus on anything and at some points second characters seem to be as important as main characters. \\n\r\nFinally, I was really disappointed by the end because it underscored its lack of real meaning. It didn't reach my expectatives and didn't give me the \"more\" I was hoping for. \\n\r\nHowever, I must say that I enjoyed watching this anime. For me it is a fair anime that is good if you don't have anything else to see and is actually really entertaining. \\n\\n\\n\r\n(My english might not be perfect, sorry for that)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Terror in Resonance was a short but thrilling ride that managed to tell a complete story in just 11 episodes. In fact, it almost tried to do too much, as I liked the way the show was going in the first four episodes more than I liked the middle section, but for sure this is a modern, fresh, original anime you should absolutely take a peek at.\r\nArt-\r\nModern and gorgeous, period. Great animation, smooth, colorful and vibrant and doesn't look dated at all. It looks like something that could come out tomorrow even though it's five years old as of this writing. The character designs ofthe two leads were actually kind of ordinary and didn't overly stand out to me- and perhaps that was done purposely- but other characters such as Five and Shibazaki stood out as being a bit more unique in their visual design.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the leads felt, again, just kind of ordinary. There wasn't anything wrong with it at all, but it never stood out either. In fact, I don't know that anyone had a voice performance that really blew me away, but I want to clarify that does not mean that anyone had a poor performance either- they didn't. The voice acting was simply good and fine but nothing beyond that.\\n\\n\r\nThe music felt like a weak point of the show for me. It simply didn't stand out at all. Very average and forgettable opening and closing songs and no background songs- even in the plethora of tense and emotional moments this anime offers up- really stood out to me and hit me in the gut the way a great soundtrack should. The sound aspect of this show, while never terrible, felt very ordinary for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter/Story-\\n\\n\r\nIn a world where every anime concept and cliche has been done, redone and redone again Terror in Resonance brings something unique to the table and that is refreshing and lovely. For the first several episodes it was a true thriller and really had me on the edge of my seat. I was getting serious Death Note vibes from these episodes, in the best way, and was thoroughly enjoying the cat and mouse game between the evil entity and the highly intelligent detective who knows better than everyone else, not too dissimilar from the classic Kira vs L battle.\\n\\n\r\nI wish they'd stayed with this, honestly, and I didn't particularly care for where they took it instead. The character Five, while uniquely designed, complex and kind of badass- simply felt unnecessary and sometimes highly convenient. There isn't actually anything wrong with her as a character at all- it was just a trying to do too much/too many cooks in the kitchen kind of situation. A lot of her backstory and how she ties into the present situation really, really stretches plausibility/believability even more so than the show, which definitely requires you to suspend your disbelief to a certain degree, already does on its own.\\n\\n\r\nThe character Lisa, while I feel she added more than nothing to the show, was also arguably convenient and unnecessary. My wife really hated this character as she's simply really dumb and there were definitely times when it felt like she was in the anime for the sole purpose of messing with the leads or giving them someone to save. I think she was intended to add emotional depth, and maybe near the end she did a little tiny bit, but the execution here could have been better and she probably could have been at least a little bit, despite her circumstances, less helpless and pathetic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nThe first four episodes were excellent and thrilling and had me really into the show. I don't love the middle section for a number of reasons, specifically, it got away from what it was doing when it simply didn't need to (if it ain't broke don't fix it), it became a lot more convenient and less believable and as a whole it just felt tough to take seriously, but then it finishes fairly strong, though not as good as the beginning, and somewhat redeems itself. There were definitely a few moments littered throughout the show where things worked in a way I have a hard time understanding or believing, but other than those annoyances it was a largely positive experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nI concluded this series with a far more positive than negative impression. With its very short running length of just 11 episodes- which is quite easy to bang out in just a night or two- I'd definitely say give it a watch if you're a fan of the genre. The ending was satisfying and had emotional depth to it and overall it's a very good show worthy of your time.\\n\\n\r\n+Fresh, original premise\\n\r\n+Very modern looking and feeling\\n\r\n+Visually beautiful\\n\r\n+Emotional depth\\n\r\n+Thrilling/suspenseful moments\\n\\n\r\n-Forgettable soundtrack\\n\r\n-Large stretches of plausibility/believability\\n\r\n-Conveniences\\n\r\n-Tried to do too much/unnecessary characters\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- 8\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 8",

            "content": "Zankyou no Terror is easily a contender for best anime of 2014, hands down. Just finishing the show and looking back over it I do not regret watching this whatsoever.\r\nStory:\r\nThis was directed by the person who wrote the script and directed Cowboy Bebop. COWBOY BEBOP. To be expected the story was fantastic. Terrorism is a very touchy subject and is often avoided in a story. Zankyou no Terror however, does not care. It puts the threat right in your face, and shows you the reality and devastation a terrorist attack has. Following the story of Nine and Twelve and they attempt to achieve their unknowngoal while leaving clues behind about their past. For originality and going beyond the regular standard of stories 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nStudio MAPPA has utterly exceeded my expectations with the art and animation. The art was beautiful, giving off a very realistic color pallet, adding to the realism and realization that this could happen in real life, maybe just not to this extent. Animation was very fluid and helped make scenes 10 times more intense than they should have been. The dark colors used throughout add to the ambiance of the show and set the mood of suspense and mystery. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe music was done by Yoko Kanno, who also did music for Cowboy Bebop. The background music was absolutely amazing. Every song perfectly set the mood for scenes and fit in perfectly. The opening and ending were amazing and really gave you a taste of how this show was gonna be. Honestly, this was to be expected of Kanno, and of boy did she deliver. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOther shows, take note of how to develop characters in 11 episodes. The characters in this show were not forgettable to the slightest and you would constantly be cheering for both sides. Nine and Twelve are 2 teens who are also the Terrorist duo known as Sphinx, and create great moments of suspense. Being terrorists you'd expect them to be all bad, but in reality, they aren't. Shibizaki is a detective who is on the case of trying to catch Sphinx, and is very, VERY, intelligent. He is the one able to decipher Nine and Twelve's riddles. The interaction between both sides creates a great mystery. And finally, the most hated character of the show, Lisa. TO be honest, I think character is a amazingly developed character. Annoying does not mean bad, and that is the case for her. Being a hostage/accomplice of Nine and Twelve, she makes decisions in a very realistic way for her situation. Irrationally. In her mind there is always the over-looming though that she could be killed at any moment by Nine and Twelve if she does something they don't like, and that leads her to make these bad decisions. She has nowhere to go and must try not to get herself killed. Being a normal citizen put into a situation like hers ruins her rational psychological state. Sure some people consider her a plot device, but she clearly has her place as a good character. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nBy now you should tell that I absolutely adored this anime. It's been quite a while since a psychological thriller mystery like this came out and it sure feels amazing to have one again. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nPlease, do yourself a favor and watch this as soon as possible, because this a just amazing. Even if you're not a huge fan of the psychological, mystery, or thriller genre, give this one a try. You will not be disappointed. Sure the show may not be absolutely perfect, but no anime is really. It's close enough to a 10 for me to give it one. If you want to nitpick at the show then be my guest, but if you don't you should extremely enjoy it.  \\n\\n\r\nIf there any grammatical errors, I apologize, my English is not perfect.",

            "content": "\u201cNeither of us was needed by anyone before. I\u2019m glad I met you.\u201d\r\nTwo boys named Nine and Twelve are complete opposites; one has a warm smile and the other has a cold gaze. Zankyou no Terror is about the boys' acts of terrorism. Along the way, they meet Lisa Mishima, a girl who is bullied by her peers and lives with a paranoid mother. The plot is intriguing because the audience has to ask themselves: Why? For two boys around the age of seventeen, terrorism is no silly matter. As the story unravels, the viewers find out about their ultimate goal as well as theirpasts that led them to their unyielding decision.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall animation of the anime is not typical and is far from the norm of a slice-of-life. The depiction of the characters leans toward a more realistic interpretation and are not those \"big-eyed, colorful hair\" art. The colors are not vibrant but rather a dark, ominous tone, fitting for a psychological, thriller type anime such as ZnT.\\n\\n\r\nThe music choice was nothing particularly outstanding but it certainly did fill its roll. I still get chills down my spine whenever a flashback plays with the electric guitar riffs. With actual songs, I found it interesting that this anime chose multiple with English lyrics, not something you hear in your typical anime. Something that bugged me, however, was that the characters who spoke in English were all good except for one minor, slightly major (?), character named Five - although, it did give me a few chuckles here and there.\\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonists, Nine and Twelve, are well-developed. The audience may find it difficult to relate to them but it is easy to sympathize with them. They are practically foils of each other; also, despite the difficult road that lies ahead of them, they are as close as can be. Lisa, no matter how much trouble she causes, moves the plot forward. However, Lisa does constantly seem like a nuissance and does not seem to do anything but be a paperweight to the Nine and Twelve duo. Next we have Detective Shibazaki, a central key to the story. Through his clever and shrewd critical thinking, he is able to play the terrorists' game. He goes as far as opposing orders to accomplish what he believes is truly righteous. As for Five, I have many questions about this character. Because of her unique personality (and odd English pronunciation) she was eccentric and sometimes just plain creepy. There were many things that were not clearly explained about Five and that left me feeling a bit disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nI can't say I am completely satisfied with the ending, but it was definitely wrapped up nicely. This show is rated R and I can understand it. The central theme of this anime is serious and should be handled with maturity. I Hope this review has cleared your thoughts on this anime and if you intend to dive into this journey, I wish you: Von voyage!",

            "content": "Zankyou No Terror was hyped to be one of the most unique anime this season. It has a unique premise and famous names attached to it. During the first five episodes, I was hyped so much that I thought to myself \"This is the feeling watching Bebop tier anime while its airing\". \r\nBut 5 episodes in, my this expectations was crushed. What could be a classic anime became a trainwreck And by the time I was ended, I realized that this was one of the most wasted potentials in any media that I saw.\r\nArt/Animation: 10\r\nThe art is astounding. Zankyou tries to be different from yourtypical anime. The art is not \"cute\" and \"bright\" but gives the sense of \"seriousness\" and being \"gloomy\". Mappa's animation in this show is film quality. Even the CGI looks so good. \\n\\n\r\nSound and Direction: 10\\n\\n\r\nYoko Kanno and Watanabe is in charge of this. And you know its good. The music is memorable and the application of these music on these scenes (First episode, flashback scenes, the bike and ferris wheel scenes) were amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe technical aspects are god tier right? Nothing could go wrong right? However, the \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\\n\r\nThis sections are related in reviewing Zankyou. Why? The story did not permit for character development. Yes the scenes, soundtrack, animation is great. But what you get is only eye candy and eargasms. Yes, the themes of Militarization, Illegal Government- Sanctioned Experiments, Misplaced Nationalism and the Coming of Age of troubled (Very troubled) teenagers as was touched. But I felt I was watching a soul less series, without any characters I could cheer on or story to become interested to. \\n\\n\r\nNine and Twelve: They seemed so interesting during the early episodes, building a sense of mystery around them as they build up the \"Sphinx\", their public persona as a terrorist duo. However, as the story continues, we nothing about their motivations and we couldn't even sympathize with their morally ambiguous actions. \\n\\n\r\nLiza: MOE BAIT? She really does nothing to the story, except FUCK THINGS UP. Does she humanize Nine and Five? No. As they reveal nothing to her about their origins nor motivations. Twelve just relates to her as she is a social outcast while Nine sees her as a baggage holding Twelve back.\\n\\n\r\nFive: Is Five even a character? She's seems just a plot device to make someone equal to the protags. Her actions seems poorly justified and unrealistic, breaking the realistic vibes the series attempted hardly during the earlier episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe only character that I could relate with is SHIBAZAKI. Shibazaki is your detective who was demoted for being too brilliant. This gives him motivation during the whole story to try to uncover the root cause and the motivations of the protags. He wants to prove to himself and others that the things he did before the story was right. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story and characterization were shit, I really enjoyed the series. Zankyou was a breathe of fresh air- it was different and promising. I was excited for every Thursday in anticipation for each episode. Without any original manga or light novel, discussing it with friends or in the internet speculating the next episodes or the characters motivation was enjoyable for me. I really really want to import the OST and Volume 1, as I really enjoyed out the hell of it and was the most played songs in my playlist and the early episodes as god tier episodes \\n\\n\r\nWhen I watched Rail Wars this seasons, I knew its a low budget anime and set my expectations low. Glasslip was my disappointment of this season as it made really no sense coming from a respectable animation studio. \\n\\n\r\nBut Zankyou is different. Its frustrating to watch how an anime that could easily be a timeless classic with its animation, soundtrack, direction and art , rate 10/10 and became the Cowboy Bebop our generation coming from the same people (Watanabe and Kanno) became a wasted potential. They could have made it at least 20 episodes for more room of character development or a good anime film removing unnecessary subplots summarizing Eps 1-4 and 10-11 and Zankyou could have been a timeless classic.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I started to watch this anime at the age when i sometimes think that I am too old for animes since I dropped a good amount of animes recently. But no, I was wrong. Zankyou no Terror is a complete masterpiece for people who like a bit of thriller and a bit of mysteries. Personally I would put this anime at Psycho Pass level.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe anime's story is great and consistent. *Minor spoiler: To those who complained, the first part about school where the duo attended is only the mean for Sphinx to mix in the visit at the government tower for the first (orsecond if you count the one at the prologue) incident to happen. The theme of children locked in an institution later on go revenge may not be that new, but the terror part is very creative and should get credit for that. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nNo complain here. The art is not mind blowingly great, but it is perfect. I love how most eps are covered in a mildly dark theme (or disturbingly bright) that gives viewers some uneasiness. I would give art a 9 but seeing how much lofi MVs on youtube using scenes from this anime, it deserves a 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe sound is actually what I like the most about this anime. OP and ED are good, but the songs in between the anime are great. Music in Zankyou no Terror mostly gives viewers a melancholy vibe. But for the one of the only shooting scene in the anime, the music and the shooting sound (as well as the art) are so great it feels like watching a hollywood movie.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nFor an anime that is plot heavy and lasts only 11 eps, characters in Zankyou no Terror are quite decent. Nine and Twelve are well executed with Nine acts as the leader and the head of the duo, cool, calm and collected but still able to act if the situation requires him to. The two act just like what we should expect from where they came from, Nine as the motionless, inhuman, brain-like part and Twelve as the heart part, love, has fun, makes joke,.... that sometimes the brain, or Nine couldnt control. If there is something I dont like about the casts, it's about the girls. Five actions were quite questionable, that in the end her motive missed me. I also found Lisa quite annoying since she mostly contributed to the story by got caught and created a mess for the duo.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: it's been quite a while since I enjoyed a mystery anime this much, I think about more than a years ago when I watched Shinsekai Yori. Definitely a 10/10\\n\\n",

They go to school like nothing is happening to help, camouflage I guess or just enjoy some school life. They have already done planning and robbing. They go in person for their plan and be like pro criminals, they have done like coded message to show they want justice for what happened to them. The protagonists were in like a concentration camp, but theywere there because they are super smart and there was also one more that escaped, but not really worth talking about (didn't really like her...... was it girl hmmm).  Anyways there is some romantic type thing going on with one other supporting girl and main pro-tag. This type of anime I really, but towards the end it just wasn't really going how I liked. The ending kinda sucked (for me). Copter came out of nowhere. I thought there was going to be an ending I liked, but I guess justice was deserved.\\n\r\nSociety has a cruel way of how things are done and there is just some places where money and power is just too much for the innocent.  One last note the Protagonists are the actual \"heroes\" in their own way, but trying to get justice because life is screwed up. Also they are criminals in a way, even though they don't actually kill anyone. I still liked this anime and what the pro-tags were doing.\\n\r\nThey didn't deserve all what was done to them.\\n\\n\r\nShort ver. Hey you like Terroristic type of things and anime here it is in one pack of just 11 episodes.\\n\r\nYou like how money and power is just overwhelming and strong and can f***k kids up. \\n\r\nAlso do you like a mystery typish anime well, investigating type of work.\\n\r\nDetective against criminals, almost got away with it, here it is.",

At the start, it nearly perfectly executed its background and exposition, revolving around a mystery-past theme commonly found in many anime. I think this anime really could have been near Death Note's level and it had the potential to, but it just failed everything. Everything episode 3 and beyond was a fail. The rival was a force character introduction with repetitive events that had no meaning. As the series continued it was plain boring repetition, and the series had no goal in mind. Then there is the most useless character in the series, Mishima Lisa. I think you should dropit and not be tricked by the first two episodes but it really is your choice on whether you want to be disappointed in the end...",

            "content": "*sighs deeply*\r\nWords can barely describe how much I enjoyed this anime. I went into watching this glorious show without knowing much about it other than fact it was about 2 teenage boys who acted as terrorists. But just knowing that alone was enough to interest me, but little did I know I was in for a bigger ride than I had expected. \r\nStory: 8.5+/10\r\nA very good plot line, I must admit. It was sophisticated, one that got you thinking and wondering about why things played out the way they did throughout the entire series, right until the end. This was probably a really big experiencefor me because I thoroughly enjoy animes that cause you to think and backtrack sometimes, it keeps the watching experience much more enjoyable and much less boring. Examples of such are Steins Gate, Psycho-Pass, and FMA, but I'll save those for another time. Branching back to ZnT, I cant tell you how intrigued I was by every little detail and niche that kept popping up as the story progressed, while still coinciding wonderfully with the overall plot line of the story. Honestly, for anyone who is looking for a well thought out story with great supporting details, accompanied by astonishing mysteries, this is a show well worth considering. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Visuals: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nTwo letters. H. D. It was a struggle trying to find all the downloadable episodes in such high quality, but the painstaking labor of finally finding all of them was extremely worth it. Watching it on my HD plasma screen... well... everything looked so damn beautiful, especially the explosions, those lovely, luminescent explosions. But not only that, the art style of the show was also very nice, not particularly unique per-say, but it had a style that fat quite nicely with the show. Actually, I believe I instantly fell in love with the visuals of this anime during the very first episode, as they were escaping from the plutonium facility. A very nice use of semi-3D animation in my honest opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n*cranks up the stereo*\\n\r\nLovely, LOVELY, soundtrack. My word, is it even legal to have such beautiful music in an anime about terrorism (loosely speaking)? I mean, I thought the visuals were great, but this is just ridiculous. As I was watching the anime, I found myself paying alittle more attention to the music playing than what was actually going on in the show, no lie. Each one had beautiful mix of bittersweet feelings to it, which was great because the anime itself was the most bittersweet masterpiece I have seen in ages. My favorite track, though, was definitely \"Walt\". Beauty. At its finest. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEach and every main character was exceptionally portrayed throughout the series, and I enjoyed watching every scene that had them in it. None of them were useless to the story or had unsatisfying back stories, they were all equipped with great personalities and usefulness. So basically, I fell in love with the cast, simple as that.\\n\\n\r\nNine\\n\r\nThe cool and sophisticated hacker mastermind behind it all. His character personality was alittle on the generic side, but that little detailed failed to undermine how well thought out his overall character really was. He had a heart that was usually hidden behind his heavily serious demeanor, which proved to be an exceptional character trait that gradually showed it's true colors thought out the series, especially towards the end. Sadly, he suffered from panic attacks and increasingly worsening headaches that only proved fatally detrimental later on, but even with that, he stayed true to his goal until the end.\\n\\n\r\nTwelve\\n\r\nThe ecstatic, mysterious little optimist in charge of constructing the bombs and carrying out other duties Nine wasn't able to. An extremely lovable character that complimented nicely with Nine's bitter attitude. I'll admit, however, he had the most fluctuating personality out of all the characters, but it was probably because he had a heart even bigger than Nine's, hence why he sincerely fell for Lisa, even when he knew doing so would prove extremely problematic for both of them (and Nine), in the end. He also had a very interesting symptom called synesthesia, which allows a person to see colors in sound, according to the anime (there's a much more complicated definition to it).\\n\\n\r\nLisa\\n\r\nThe shy and rather quiet girl who suffered from both domestic and social problems. She was honest, and also had a very big heart for those she cared about, and there was never a time in the series I disliked this character. I found her very important to the story, especially in regards to the unintentional relationship she gradually developed with Twelve. Yes, she was weak in many areas Nine and Twelve excelled in, but being with the two began to influence her exponentially in a positive way that allowed her to become a good character (we can thank Twelve for this). Yes, she was also the damsel in distress a few times, but damn, she played the part so well, honestly. It fueled alittle more needed material into the story, which I didn't find bad at all. And that fact that she was mature enough to admit she may have screwed up rather big a few times, only made me credit her more as a character. In many cases, distressed damsels become very irritating for me when it comes to shows, but in this one, it was a different story.\\n\\n\r\nShibazaki\\n\r\nThe badass detective. This guy... he deserved some kind of medal for his services, not the bullsh*t the higher ups gave him, but that's besides the point. The intelligence of this man was exceptional, mainly because he was able to crack  Sphinx's riddles so acutely, grabbing and processing the little details many of his other co-workers failed to even notice. Like all the other cast members did, he had heart of gold. I understand that at the start of the series, he was strictly hell-bent on bringing down Sphinx, but when he starting seeing the full picture of what Nine and Twelve's motives really were, he began to calm down, even as far as telling one of the army men who was ready to strike them down aerially not to shoot the two boys, thinking it was more sane to put them through a trial. Basically, the man knew his sh*t, which is why he was such an enjoyable character to see in action while watching the show. Not only that, his past was just as chilling and interesting as the other main characters of the show.  \\n\\n\r\nFive\\n\r\nThe sadistic little demon child with rad looking hair. I don't exactly know why, but I liked her addition to the story. An extremely vague character at first, as you ventured through the show, her personality and character development really begins to grow on you. I'll admit, I wasn't too keen on as to why she was so concerned with defeating Nine, and still isn't completely sure, but whatever the case might've been, I was genuinely intrigued with her actions during the last couple episodes. It was quite surprising, and I enjoyed every minute of it. And not only that, she managed to come extremely close to destroying everything Sphinx was meant to accomplish, a very worthy opponent to the story, I'd have to conclude. Additionally, I found it interesting that she also shared similar symptoms to Nine.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSafe to say, I enjoyed every minute of this wonderfully rendered show. It got me thinking about so much I had never known before. I've always been a fan of Greek mythology and ancient gods, so watching this anime was also loads of fun. Every time it was time for the detective agency (mainly Shibazaki) to start cracking the riddles, it was like getting ready to begin an ancient mythology class, it was just that intriguing to me, especially since some of the things they talked about I had no knowledge about prior to watching the series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5+ (It wasn't perfect, but it was damn well good enough)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was very good. Much better and emotionally nerve-wrecking than I had ever imagined, which only made me love it more. Everything that went into this anime, from the story to the knowledge it provided, highly including everything that came in between, was amazing and brilliantly played out in a way that would draw anyone looking for a sophisticated, one of a kind AND well executed show. Oh, and keep in mind, no fillers. I've witnessed short anime series who actually had the audacity to squeeze in a filler. Never a good thing. Which is why this one is just precious in every way imaginable. Zankyou no Terror is a must, really. If your looking for an anime with some serious finesse, this is the one to watch, you won't regret it, and if you do, well... lets hope you don't.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*I apologize for any typos/grammatical errors by the way*",

            "content": "Zankyou no Terror is a toboggan ride that whisks you into its world immediately, with every minute of its 11-episode run speeding you down its intricate plot until you, completely satisfied and yet still yearning for more, reach its end. Though it\u2019s an anime, it has none of the characteristics which turn away casual viewers of the genre\u2014no fanservice, no awkward situations involving siblings, no overly forced comedy relief. It\u2019s a show that takes itself seriously throughout its entire run, and doesn\u2019t suffer for it. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys shows with a gripping plot, a phenomenal soundtrack, and a cast ofwell-written and dynamic characters. Oh, and I forgot to mention: the art is excellent in both direction and execution. It\u2019s easier to explain if you just watch the anime.\\n\\n\r\n\tLet\u2019s begin with the plot. To pare it down to its most basic form, Zankyou no Terror is an action drama that focuses mainly on two young terrorists from Japan. The premise itself is quite novel, though the anti-hero protagonist has been done in other popular shows like Death Note. As the first episode finishes, you\u2019re left with numerous questions regarding who the two teens are and why they\u2019re blowing up building. And after each successive episode, the director Shinichiro Watanabe leaves you with more questions. When the show ends, it\u2019s a very satisfying ending. It makes sense, and yet you\u2019re still clamoring for more. At least, I was. So yes, the plot is VERY interesting, though I don\u2019t wish to spoil it for anyone who may watch.\\n\\n\r\n\tAs for the soundtrack, I\u2019ll say this: not only does it have incredible production quality, but it also fits the atmosphere of the show EXTREMELY well. This is especially true for the tracks that play during emotional scenes. The OST as a whole has an unreal feel to it that mirrors the world that Watanabe builds. Though the show is ostensibly set in present day Japan, the main characters and their actions make the events that unfold seem impossible in our world. The OST fits this scenario extremely well.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe characters, oh, the characters. The show has a relatively small cast, and I admire this choice because it allowed Watanabe to develop each character well with only 11 episodes. Nine, or Sphinx Number 1, is very serious about what they (Nine and Twelve) set out to do. His precision and cautiousness balance out Twelve\u2019s (Sphinx Number Two) carefree playfulness, and the dynamic between the two is beautiful to see. The two grow as they accomplish their mission, though in subtle ways. Lisa Mishima is more of a flat character, being clumsy until the very end, but she doesn\u2019t get annoying often. Now, the main detective who is on the Sphinx case, Shibazaki, is a veritable badass. Just search up a picture of him and admire that facial hair. Aesthetics aside, Shibazaki is the epitome of the hard-eyed detective who puts his life and salary on the line to pursue the truth. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe art is beautiful. Enough said there. Well, not really. Character designs are wonderful. Settings fit the atmosphere. Everything is very solid.\\n\\n\r\n\tI would give the show a 10/10, because it\u2019s a complete package that fits into 11 episodes. It\u2019s a relatively short watch, but is extremely worthwhile. \\n\\n",

The damn thing is so attractive to the senses and in general much more solid than the average series that is not something I could just ignore, then I never really imagined the mediocrity that came after.\r\nThe plot revolves around two young terrorists that go in a rampage so they can expose some secret plansmade by the usual suspects, plans that involved some degree of human experimentation and secrecy juicy enough to feed the needy. After that the series focuses in the intrigue behind the terrorist attacks made by the group, and the police efforts to catch them.\\n\\n\r\nYou might except some interesting back-story and some intense development to the characters, after all the secrecy seems to have some dark history, so why not?\u2026 well you are left stranded as there\u2019s no solid or interesting character or story development whatsoever, not of their origin story, their relationship as survivors and avengers, their motives which seem to be so important to them, etc. you name it, this series is as arid as your favorite desert (not the wet ones).\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s the main issue with this one, it\u2019s full of potential yet lacking so much in the content department. It seems they thought the whole terrorist attack thing would stretch far enough to fill the whole series\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t, the whole thing just feels incomplete as not even the apparent star of the series, this being the \u201cdetectivesque\u201d story that fills most of the chapters, is overly scripted and unexciting as the plot itself lowers the tension behind them via its less than intense characters.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on, as to wonder why there is not more development between the protagonists and the enemy featured later, why aren\u2019t more back stories to characters such as Lisa which supposedly play a contrasting role to the protagonists (you are left in the let\u2019s assume this thing as the obvious stereotypical answer), how far does the secrecy goes so we can feel the intensity and urgency of the plot, an a long etc. which is not worth the time\u2026 since the thing already ended along with every chance of this being something more.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, good idea, good visual quality, a definitive letdown\u2026 it didn\u2019t particularly pique my interest, as I said, but it\u2019s worth the warning. \\n",

            "content": "[THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER-FREE]\r\nAfter watching the last episode of Zankyou no Terror two days ago, I think I can finally come to a suitable conclusion for my mixed-up thoughts. Let's see if I can organize them into a coherent review, ahah. \r\nStory: 5/10 \r\nI enjoyed the first couple of episodes, I really did. The story seemed interesting enough, and everything was so cleverly done (seriously, I felt like a dumbass pretty much the entire time T_T) that it was hard to NOT get hooked. I mean, terrorists! In Tokyo! With explosions! \r\nI think I got my hopes up too high, though.\r\nAfter episode 8, with stilllittle to no explanations, I was beginning to wonder how everything would end up because there were only three more episodes left to reveal Nine's and Twelve's pasts, as well as their reasons for wanting to leave bombs that didn't actually hurt anyone all over the city. And my fears were right. I felt that their reasons, while touching (my heart is already in a fragile state thanks to Tokyo Ghoul), were a little bit too petty for my liking, and I found it hard to believe that the two of them would go through SO MUCH trouble just because of THAT. (< being purposely vague because spoilers suck.) \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, ZnT had a pretty mediocre story that didn't live up to the suspense it had built up from the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nSo maybe I was a little unrealistic in my expectations for character development. Nine and Twelve were interesting for me in the beginning, but they quickly became boring after Ep. 8. I don't know, I wanted more from Nine (I have a soft spot for him... he's kind of hot, okay), though I did sort of like his smart-silence personality. And Twelve... WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CREEPY BABY? He had SO much potential in being a crazy but lovable psycho, but nope, after meeting Lisa he became Mr. Sweetie Hero. \\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to Lisa. Frankly, Lisa was a disappointment. I wanted more character development in her, because she remained pretty much the same throughout the entire anime: dull, one-dimensional, and weak. Look, I *don't* have a thing against weak characters -- but I want them to be properly done so that I can sympathize with them. For Lisa, apart from giving us a brief background of her family, that was pretty much it. I don't see what was so charming about her, or why Twelve risked his long-standing friendship with Nine for her in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not to say that I hate the Twelve + Lisa ship, because I don't. I just feel that Lisa could have been crafted into a much more interesting character, even if she was weak, and maybe then it might have better justified Twelve's actions in Ep. 8. \\n\\n\r\nAs for Five... talk about a drama queen. She was another character I found super badass when she first appeared (that hairdo, though), but after what she did in Ep. 10? I'm just-- I can't understand it. I can't understand why a girl with such a brilliant mind would choose to do that because it doesn't fit in with her character at all. \\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nI seem to be the black sheep here, though, so maybe I'm being a little too picky with an anime that's only 11 episodes long. Still, I do think that Zankyou no Terror could have been a lot better done if some things hadn't happened. *cough* Anyway, I still did enjoy myself while watching this, so my overall score is 7/10. I'm just crying for the lost potential. \\n\\n\r\nBut, uh, on the bright side, at least the music is beautiful? YOKO KANNO, EVERYONE. Go search up \"Walt\" and prepare to have your mind blown.",

Literally more than the bad guys at this point.\r\nI just want to punch her weak ass in the face, she is so annoying and only vaguely useful once or twice. I mean, I don't think she ever thought a single thing through through out the entire process, and honestly while I understand her relevance to the plot and the story, and her position as foil and her character as written basically to help withthe character development of the boys and to bare witness to their story, but I don't understand why she is there.\\n\\n\r\nLike, why is she included, why was the story made to fit her in it, why was she made important. There seem to be people who watched this show and didn't mind her, but to me she was so consistently stupid, it was like watching \"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time\" all over again. \\n\\n\r\nLike, I realize she was a bullied, depressed, shrinking violet who was only just alive enough inside to not be suicidal, but there was never one part in the show where I feel like she actually realized the situation she was in. And not in a, \"I don't want to think about my situation\" way, but in a \"I'm too stupid and have no common sense\" way. God, she is definitely the kind of person who would get pulled into a cult.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry for bitching like this, but she was honestly ruining the show for me the entire time. And it wasn't cute or even that much of a comedic relief. It was just super annoying.\\n\\n\r\nGood show, awesome art and cinematography, all characters were at least servicable, but her, (and maybe that overly enthusiastic and emotional police officer character that every anime seems to need,). I can't enjoy shows completely if I can't enjoy the characters, so she almost single-handedly brought it down for me every time we focused on her. Honestly, she was just a damsel constantly in distressed who continuously made everything worse. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, none of this was really her fault, and 12 was the one who made contact, and she was desperate for contact, which was why she never turned it down. Still. It made it seem like it was her story, like we were seeing it through her eyes for the purpose of her development which is a common method of story telling, but I didn't like her enough to care that she \"grew\" as a person.\\n\\n\r\nSo, so, so stupid all of the time and always realizing things too late.\\n\\n\r\nUgh.",

The second reason why I can't it's because it's predictable. From the moment it starts you know how it will end, after all morality will always prevail against evil... Right?. So why did I rate \"Story\" with a 10? Well, because even though you know how it will end the journeymight surprise you, and the \"journey\" in this story is superb.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful, the way the scenarios are presented are breathtaking. Enough said.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound would be one of the \"problems\". Don't misunderstand me the end \"mix\" of sounds it's amazing, the music, the ambient sounds etc are really great, but in my opinion -and not just in this anime- when an American, European (etc, etc) appears in the anime let an American or European speak or the -lets call it- magic of the character vanishes away and the character becomes something that you can't \"believe\". Yes I know that this isn't an American production but trying a little harder doesn't hurt.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, it's probably the best of this anime. Some might look useless but most of the time some of those \"useless\" character are important for they're \"triggers\" for the main ones. Ex. Lissa.\\n\\n\r\nFor a closure this anime was enjoyable, every episode leaves you hanging and guessing what's going to happen next -even though you already know how this will end-.",

            "content": "~ ~ Story 7/10 ~ ~\r\nThe story sucks you in from the very first stunningly animated heist scene and it stays fast-paced from there. It slows down only for us to get a little glimpse of the characters but not for long because the mystery behind Sphinx is what's driving the show. While I have to admit that there's an arc (about 3-4 episodes long) that felt kind of pointless in the grand scheme of things, the clever puzzles that are solved in each episode contribute to a heart-wrenching overarching tale of vengeance (or not, depending on how you see it). The grand payoff inthe end isn't as grand as I hoped it would be but it does leave you with much moral-questioning.\\n\\n\r\n~ ~ Characters 7/10 ~ ~\\n\\n\r\nNine and Twelve were really interesting even though I knew next to nothing about them. Their interactions, the easygoing casualness of Twelve and the ice-cold rationalizing of Nine, balanced each other out. Lisa, the awkward highschooler with a troubled family background, paled in comparison because although her confusion was relatable, she didn't matter to the plot aside from being the occasional damsel in distress. On the other side of the table, the character of Five was like Lisa's more crafty and badass counterpart aka she also seems pretty useless too if you think of her role in the whole context of the story. Her reluctant rival/ally, Detective Shibazaki, was a brilliant character with an understandable backstory but he was by no means the most memorable anime detective.\\n\\n\r\n~ ~ Art 10/10 ~ ~\\n\\n\r\nIt's realistic, fluid and has beautiful camera angling. The colors change according to the mood but overall it sticks to the realism (except for Five who has silver hair and purple eyes for no flipping reason).\\n\\n\r\n~ ~ Sound 10/10 ~ ~\\n\\n\r\nYoko Kanno bless your soul, just bless you to heaven and beyond. Everything from the gorgeous opening sequence to that serene motorcycle scene (\"Is feat. POP ETC\") to the unique Icelandic song (\"Von feat. Arn\u00f3r Dan\") was perfect at conveying all the feels.\\n\\n\r\n~ ~ Enjoyment 7/10 ~ ~\\n\\n\r\nFull of suspense in some moments, peace in others, WTFery in some scenes and \"what's the point of all this?\" in others. \\n\\n\r\n~ ~ Overall 8/10 ~ ~\\n\r\nA must-watch for anyone who's thirsting for strategic mindgames, likable morally ambiguous characters, and elegantly animated action sequences.",

            "content": "As an anime fan, at some point in the past or the future, we must explain an anime to a fellow otaku. Be it the religious symbolism behind Evangelion, or what makes Clannad one of the saddest anime ever, or why is Sword Art Online such a crowd splitter. But there are those few shows that can\u2019t be explained so easily in full. Zankyou no Terror is one of these shows, a psychological masterpiece that deals with a topic hardly seen in anime, terrorism.\r\nIf you aren\u2019t prepared going into this series, your brain will get thrown around the inside of your skull like a pinball,while you try to figure out who are the bad guys, and why they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re doing. Throw in governmental secrets and conspiracies, ancient mythology, modern society, the weakness of reality, and you got yourself a deadly mix. No worries though, everything gets explained in the end. And holy cow, the ride there is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\n(Before I say anything, I\u2019d just like to point out, the director of this anime is Shinichiro Watanabe, yes, the same man who engineered the classic masterpiece, Cowboy Bebop. That said, moving on!)\\n\r\nTokyo has just been hit by a terrorist attack and as the nation tries to look for the criminals, they come to light themselves. Through an internet video site they reveal themselves to the public; two masked teenagers that call themselves Sphinx. Their real names? \\n\r\nNine and Twelve.\\n\r\nThe  meaning behind their names is explained in the series. \\n\r\nThey are hell bent on wreaking havoc on Tokyo, destroy buildings and blow up trains, yet the puzzling thing behind their schemes is that they never kill anyone.\\n\r\nEver. \\n\r\nWhy would they plan everything so perfectly, give difficult riddles to the police to solve, blow up something yet not kill a single person? And so, we see acts of terrorism through the eyes of these two boys, and an innocent girl, thrown into this mess against her own will.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nTo start off with the main duo, Nine is a cool, collective and very intelligent boy, and from the outside, looks like a typical student genius. In the anime he is seen as the mastermind of Sphinx's operations. Almost a mirror image of Nine, Twelve is a loud and cheerful individual who helps Nine carry out his acts of terror. His cheerful attitude may be a bit off sometimes, like when he's throwing around a grenade like a tennis ball, or when he's on his motorbike flying past traffic down a highway. Together the two are a very interesting pair. From the outset, you may not know how to feel towards them. Are they good? Are they the bad guys? And because of the fact that they never kill, as viewers, we are drawn into the anime, trying to find out more and more about these two. \\n\r\nThe previously mentioned girl, Lisa Mishima, is a very shy and reserved character who is a frequent victim of bullying. To add to that, she has a mother who is insanely overprotective, to a dangerous level, so it's clear that she will find it extremely difficult to cope with the fact that she has no choice but to be an accomplice to terrorists. Even just her presence alone is enough to add a really dark tone to the show. Her clumsiness and inability to deal with dangerous situations makes this anime appear more dismal and sombre than it really is, and it makes the show even better. Yeah that's one of the parts that are hard to explain. Watch the anime and you'll see what I'm on about... \\n\r\nLastly, from the initial characters, we have Shibazeki. Shibazeki is an older police detective who has been thrown out from Investigations to Archives, due to an old case that went wrong. He is brought back because he's the only person who can solve Sphinx's riddles, and because he's the best detective that the police has. If you take Shibazeki, and mix him in with the rest, you may get a feeling of a similarity to Death Note in there somewhere. There is one more character that is important, however that is a big spoiler. \\n\\n\r\nANIMATION & SOUND\\n\r\nThe animation was done by a studio called MAPPA, a studio I've never heard of. \\n\r\nI'll just say it the way it is, the animation is beautiful. Looking from the outside in, it doesn't look like much, but the animation greatly adds to the show, much more than any average anime would. The anime uses vivid colours, but it is dark at the same time, does that make sense? The show was made in 2014, and some scenes from it look like real life photographs. I mean, the detail used in some scenes is just spectacular. Also the art styles used for the characters are quite unique. For some reason, whenever I see Mishima's eyes, I think of Kurisu from Steins;Gate.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack....\\n\r\nUm...okay. Two words. \\n\r\nYoko. Kanno. \\n\r\nThat is all. Yoko Kanno is one of the best composers for anime of all time. Known mostly for the epic soundtracks from Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell : SAC, she yet again uses her talent to create one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. A mix of musical genres, with some excellent piano tracks, but where the soundtrack shines the most (and I mean, SHINES) are the vocal tracks. The most notable track in my opinion is the Icelandic song called \"Von\", sung by An\u00f3r Dan. This six minute wonder is just beautiful, a soft repeated motif on piano, with a gentle vocal and flowing orchestral strings...it's just, wow. \\n\r\nThe opening is also worth a mention. \"Trigger\" by Yuuki Ozaki (the guy who sang the Anohana opening) is as amazing as the rest of the soundtrack. In terms of visuals, I cannot describe it. It reminds me of the Steins Gate opening....with its shaking images and use of filters....\\n\\n\r\nFINAL EVALUATION\\n\r\nWow.... What an anime. Like I said, the only way to understand what kind of anime this is, is to go and watch it.\\n\r\nI find it difficult to believe that all of this fit into ELEVEN EPISODES. I know, right?!?! The only anime I've seen that had a short amount of episodes and worked so well was Anohana. \\n\r\nZankyou no Terror has so many unique elements to it, it has dealt with topics that are hardly touched in anime. It broke itself off the chain of typical animes, and oh boy, did it work well!\\n\r\n10/10 \\n\r\nA masterpiece.\\n\r\nI Really was surprised to see how well it was made. I watched the whole thing from start to finish in about six hours, and enjoyed every minute of it.\\n\r\nWhy SHOULD you watch Zankyou no Terror? \\n\r\n- gripping story\\n\r\n- unique story elements \\n\r\n- excellent characters \\n\r\n- amazing animation \\n\r\n- oh the soundtrack.... \\n\r\n- VERY interesting approach to the topic.\\n\r\nWhy should you NOT watch Zankyou no Terror? \\n\r\n- it is not a relaxation anime\\n\r\n- you may not like the characters\\n\r\n~thobiazz~\\n",

            "content": "I'm going to be honest, I was really excited for Zankyou No Terror. You have my favorite director, Shinichiro Watanabe, teaming back up with my favorite composer, Yoko Kanno, to produce an anime with studio Mappa. Cowboy Bebop and Kids On The Slope are two of my absolute favorite series. It would be sacrilege for me not be excited especially with the trailer they showed off before it aired, but the important question is, did it live up to my expectations. Well, yes and no. Let me explain\r\nStory\r\nIt's not often that you see for a thriller anime this grounded in reality like. There's no superpowers, magical girls, demons or shinigami. Zankyou No Terror manages to be unique and engaging without trying to get ridiculous like a lot of other series tend to do. It also doesn't treat the audience like a bunch of kids. Just because it's about terrorism doesn't mean that it's nothing but explosions and military style gunfights but it does have a couple of action scenes, it's a thriller after all. This series is pretty much all about mind games and it pulls it off very well but it has it's fair share of issues. There are a few plot points that happen after a new antagonist is introduced in the latter half of the series that just felt... dumb. To avoid spoilers, I won't actually talk about them to avoid spoilers but you'll know them when you see them. There's also the issue of the ending. Don't get me wrong, the ending itself wasn't actually bad but it's presentation felt a bit rushed. It's like 3/4 into the last episode, the producers just said \"oh wait, this is the last episode\" and then sent a frenzy of plot points your way and it all feels anti-climatic. To restate myself, the ending isn't actually bad, it's just the presentation. It could of really benefited from another episode.\\n\\n\r\nDispite a few short comings, Zankyou No Terror had a very solid and well presented story. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nMappa did a fantastic job with the series. The animation reaches Five Centimeters Per Second level of quality on multiple occasions. It's incredibly crisp, detailed and consistent. The incredibly detailed animation  is also accompanied by some gorgeous lighting and great cinematography that showcases everything at creative and interesting angles. All this is also accompanied by some good character designs. Everybody actually looks realistic. You don't see the regular anime designs with big eyes and outrageous hair. I really like the designs.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Zankyou No Terror is absolutely stunning.  10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nYoko Kanno is the composer. Need I say more? She brings her A game here and it's some of her best work yet. Each composition fits the mood perfectly. The voice acting carries this same level of polish. Despite there being no english dub, the voice acting here is incredible. The actors really know how to potray the characters\\n\\n\r\nJust like the animation, the sound is executed flawlessly. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters are easily the most disappointing aspect of Zankyou No Terror. They never get any real development and the little they do get just feels pointless. The main character, Nine, is just soooooo boring. Twelve is a lot more interesting and actually gets developed but it's just so they can shove a pseudo romance thing where it's really not needed. Lisa is easily the worst of the bunch. She's a useless klutz. That's the beginning and end of her character and despite a lot happening to her in the series, she never develops. There's only one character I can say I actually like and that's Shibuzaki. He actually has an interesting back story, good development and expresses genuine emotion.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are so mediocre with only one exception. They're easily the worst part of the show 6/10\\n\\n\r\nVerdict\\n\r\nZankyou No Terror might suffer a few pacing and character issues but this is still a very well done show that you shouldn't miss. 9/10",

To be fair, I enjoyed the art and the music of the show. The opening is quite moving. We endeavour to learn more about Nine and Twelve and are handed out an explanation for their actions and the anime promptly ends two episodes later. Another season would have helped the characters be more fleshed out and make us more sympathetic towards them. The riddles make the anime seem moreprofound, though the reasons they're posed is once again unclear. Five is simply a terrible character with no motives but an intellectual competitor and the chess game she orchestrates in the airport was perplexing. The worst part was the answer to which all of the audience awaits: Why become a terrorist? To gain attention. To shed light on a morbid facility for orphans of which there were three survivors. There are a thousand less reckless ways of doing so. I did like Shibazaki, though he's your standard detective character. Overall, I enjoyed watching the show, though several aspects of it were disappointing. A dose of clarity and rationale would have done wonders. But there you go.",

            "content": "This anime is NOT about terrorism. Believe it or not it has nothing to do with it actually. Maybe you are thinking: ''WTF is she crazy? The title? The whole anime series? Why it doesn't have to do with terrorism? '' \r\nI personally am over 18 and don't look or judge things just from the appearance . I tend to look deeper and think of the darkest meanings. So, enough with this let's get to the point. The point in this anime was to sensitize people about life, human rights and feelings such as love, loneliness etc. \r\nStory: 10/10 \r\nIt's a 10 because I haven'tseen a cleverest way to transform the ''wave'' of different feelings the author wanted to pass in a better way. Moreover, I haven't watched a similar anime to Zankyou no terror so I find the idea unique and artistic. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 \\n\r\nHopefully a well done anime with the greatness of art too. I think no one disagrees about how beautiful it was. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 \\n\r\nOf course , Zankyou no terror had, has and will have one of the best music synthesia I've heard. Music ''pops'' in right times and it's well written and performed. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nIt's a 9 because we didn't really learn about the kids there, I'm almost satisfied with the main characters . I wanted some more information about ''Five'' tho. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10\\n\r\nI can't describe how hyped I was in the whole anime. I was captured by it's beauty and went with the flow until the end. I was amazed that once more I was thinking while was watching an anime and I didn't plainly watch it.I hope people that dropped it will change their mind and reconsider. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 \\n\r\nI think I'm clear about my opinion from the previous rates. This anime I guess is made for smart audience so probably many of the people who watched it thought that there were just children that were playing around making bombs and stuff. I don't want to underestimate people out there but I think that Zankyou no terror has to be watched by a mature and smart people in order to be appreciated eventually. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for your time. ^^",

            "content": "Zankyou no Terror, or Terror's Echo as I like to call it in English, is an action thriller anime about two young men and the terrorist acts they commit in Tokyo. Their names are Nine and Twelve, both names being numbers since they are never given proper names at any point in the show's run. Terror's Echo primarily focuses on them and what they wish to achieve through their acts of terrorism, although their intentions aren't entirely known until a bit later on. Other characters featured throughout the series are Mishima Lisa, a high school girl who is constantly bulliedby her peers and coddled by her overbearing mother. Kenjiro Shibazaki, a detective who is quickly caught up in the riddling schemes of Nine and Twelve. And lastly Five, an American FBI agent who appears later in the series and is somehow connected to Nine and Twelve. \\n\\n\r\nThe main cast gets the most character development here, which is good given the series rather short length of 11 episodes. Some may be disappointed that it doesn't continue longer, but I believe it has just the right number of episodes so as to not overstay its welcome. The pacing is quick and tight, and the blend of action, character development, and story are perfect all the way up to the final episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals and audio are no slouches either. The animation is fantastic throughout, with good animation during the action sequences and fantastic art when things are a bit calmer. Even minor characters with little screen time are drawn incredibly well, and you'll never feel taken aback by side characters who look overly generic. The music is composed by Yoko Kanno, perhaps best known for creating the soundtrack to Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex. Her work is truly excellent here as well, giving the series a very modern feeling soundtrack that manages to be exciting, somber, and haunting all within the span of a single episode. The opening and ending theme also deserve praise, boasting beautiful animation and featuring excellent music to accompany them. I never once felt like skipping the opening or ending because of how good they are, and it really helps set the tone for each episode both going in and finishing it.\\n\\n\r\n     If you're looking for a good thriller series with interesting themes and excellent writing, Terror's Echo may just be what you're looking for. It may be a bit heavy for some, but it is incredibly rewarding and highly entertaining, and as such gets my highest recommendation. Watch it, you won't regret it.",

It's also about a girl who just randomly happens to join the group. This anime has this code geass/death note feeling going on the geniuses vs police thing. The story started out really great, followed up by AMAZING art, kickass soundtrack and well made characters.I really thought this anime would end up being a masterpiece but it sadly fell a little short towards the ending. It felt slightly rushed and i felt like they left out a lot of potential. In the end it's still a very good show, with some LEGENDARY scenes, the bike scene.. goose bumps *w*. You should check this out if you like psychological thrillers like deathnote. \\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8",

The story tells us about a sudden attack from 'Terrorists' who called them self Sphinx . These Sphinx always give riddle to the police which i kind of like the idea .

            "content": "If society talks about \u201cterrorism\u201d it\u2019s a rather unpleasant subject. Terrorism is defined as an attitude and behavior, which aims to achieve (political, religious or ideological) goals by creating fear/terror. This can be done through bombing buildings or cyber hacking and often targets people who have nothing to do with it: civilians. But is the (from Watanabe Shinichiro directed) \u201cZankyou no Terror\u201d the same?\r\nStory: \u201cZankyou no Terror\u201d or \u201cTerror in Resonance\u201d is about two young boys called Nine and Twelve who are determined to carry out their mysterious plan to wake up the society they live in. To achieve that goal, they are not afraidto use bombs (while still trying not to hurt anyone). However in their first bombing, a shy girl named Mishima Lisa -who already knew these boys as Arata Kokonoe and Touji Hisami from school- sees them after they planted the bomb. Twelve now gives her a decision: Either she dies, or she joins them as an accomplice and never has the chance to turn back. \\n\\n\r\nThen we have the other side of the coin: The police force. They obviously try to catch those terrorist, because they are a great threat to Tokyo or even to entire Japan. Nine and Twelve actually legitimately give them hints through difficult riddles they broadcast via live streams. In those live streams they call themselves Sphinx #1 and Sphinx #2 which is a reference to their mythology based enigmas.\\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoy this story idea and that it slowly builds on itself with every episode. But at first it doesn\u2019t really feel like it\u2019s going anywhere\u2026 Still, the perspective of both the side of the police and the side of the terrorists is great. 8.5/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Zankyou no Terror likes to play with a warm-cold theme. You can hear that in the opening and even Mishima Lisa herself says in the first episode: \u201cThat was a smile like the sun on a hot summer day with eyes like ice\u201c referencing both Twelve and Nine. These two are decent characters, for reasons I will explain soon. But sadly, almost (if not every) other character is the huge weak part of the Anime.\\n\\n\r\nNine: Nine or Arata Kokonoe is the mind of Sphinx. He is a calm and composed character who is very clever. He seems to see Twelve as his brother but dislikes the uselessness of Mishima Lisa. However, it looks like he just doesn\u2019t want her to get involved and thus hurt. He is restrained, definitely smart and extremely good at computing and hacking. He was in the same Institution as Twelve and Five and has a post-traumatic stress disorder because of it. Memories or nightmares about the facility and/or Five give him panic attacks - mainly because he feels guilty about not being able to save Five.\\n\\n\r\nTwelve: Twelve or Touji Hisami is the heart of Sphinx. He is a playful and energetic character who likes to mess around sometimes. Twelve likes to be around other people, but until he met Mishima it was mainly Nine he could be with. Even though he acts very friendly, you can see his violent sides in the beginning. That, however, doesn\u2019t seem to continue on in the later story progression. Twelve is extraordinarily good at remembering things and has a sickness called \u201csynesthesia\u201d. This makes him able to see sound as colors.\\n\\n\r\nMishima Lisa: She is an introverted, quiet and clumsy young girl who first meets Nine and Twelve while getting bullied in school. Mishima also has home problems and thus nobody to talk to. For that she despises the world. Even though Mishima is afraid of Sphinx in the beginning, she soon understands that this will maybe give her a wanted change in life. Twelve is actually threatening her life and says, that if she makes one mistake he will kill her (which is actually against Sphinx\u2019s resolve). Sadly Mishima does nothing but making mistakes and gets away with it. Her entire character seems pretty unnecessary and is only there to give the duo accompany. Further, Twelve describes her voice as a rare pale yellow. \\n\\n\r\nShibazaki Kenjirou: Shibazaki, the Japanese detective started out as an interesting character who was the only one able to understand and solve Sphinx\u2019s riddles. He seems fairly lazy but when confronted with danger he quickly switches to a smart minded und well experienced detective with a great sense of justice. We learn something about his past and that he is afraid of Sphinx planting the Plutonium Bomb. Even though it kind of annoyed me that nobody else was able to solve the riddles (except for that always-eating archive guy, who unknowingly helped) I think that Shibazaki had great potential until Five showed up and let him stand in the dust. He was always there but absolutely powerless against anyone else. This brings us to the next Problem:\\n\\n\r\nFive: Five is a psychotic and sadistic girl that was in the same facility as Nine and Twelve. She has no problem killing everything and everyone to catch Sphinx for pathetic playing reasons. I found it very unrealistic that she had no problem getting on top of the Japanese Government and do all the stuff she wanted \u2013unwatched by any high-up\u2019s. She often speaks Engrish when working, which makes sense because she works for America, but it still was pretty weird. I have no problem with Engrish in Anime; however I can definitely see people being extremely annoyed by it. \\n\\n\r\nI think that Zanykou no Terror\u2019s characters were fairly acceptable but not great in a whole. On the other side, every character had absolutely fitting voice actors (But I don't count the voice actors into \"Characters\"). 6.5/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: The art in Zankyou no Terror is very fitting and the realism of the Animation pretty much resembles the realism of terrorism. The character designs were right on and portrayed every personality well. The dark and greyish colors also did an impressive job of setting the mood. 10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound/OST: The opening \u201cTrigger\u201d by Galileo Galilei was absolutely amazing. It didn\u2019t really make you particularly happy or sad, it was just kind of neutral; which I think fits the Anime well. The mood Watanabe wants you to be in will be delivered through the Anime itself. It had fitting text and (like I said somewhere above) even the warm-cold theme in it. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST was created by Kanno Yoko who has worked with Watanabe before. The songs were extremely right on! Every tune was very beautifully composed and made scenes way better than they would\u2019ve been without. It was truly impressive work.\\n\\n\r\nAs the OST, the ending \u201cDare ka, Umi wo\u201d was also done by Kanno Yoko and sung by Aimer. On the contrary to the opening, this was rather on the sad side and concluded every episode very well. It sounds kind of elegant and unique.\\n\\n\r\nThis magnificent Sound definitely gets 10/10 from me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler free thoughts about the last episode: The mystery box finally opened. Every last piece is now in place and the show can begin - or rather, end. I\u2019ve read a ton of hate for this ending but I actually like it. While I had some doubt about this Anime in the middle I think it definitely concluded in a pleasant way. The complete episode was written very well, but it almost seems that the episodes 2-10 were only fillers to get to this epic end.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall thoughts and score: Overall I think that Zankyou no Terror should definitely be an Anime on your list. It has beautiful art, unique music, an interesting plot but lacks a bit in characters (-development) and story progression. Altogether it is genuinely enjoyable!

            "content": "It's not very often I walk into an anime having no prior knowledge about it and actually enjoying it. Now I am a person with simple tastes considering HoTD is a guilty pleasure of mine, but Zankyou no Terror despite it's small problems is one of the best animes the season had to offer. To put it in a short and simple way, go watch this show. \r\nNow here is an actual review. \r\nStory/Characters: The story in this is never perfectly explained. All I'm going to tell you is that there are two characters, Nine and Twelve, who want to destroy Tokyo and some othermajor characters that include Shibazaki and Lisa. I won't mention any other characters to prevent spoilers. I personally believe that Zankyou no Terrors character development it one of the weakest aspects of the show. Some may disagree but I felt as though characters like Lisa were introduced and never used and never deepened. Although you get to see characters like Lisa grow in situations it never feels natural. It somewhat feels forced all the way throughout the end. But one thing that this show does very well is definitely character interaction. The conversations between Twelve and Lisa are fun and enjoyable while conflicts involving Shibazaki are intense and very well written. There are also some very amazingly well written sequences one involving a Ferris wheel which was one of the best scenes in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is absolutely stunning. It's up to par with most anime movie animations. The art uses very contrasting colors in my opinion. Sometimes there will be a lot of light and then it will switch back to a darker color palette, but it all feels natural making the art flow throughout the entire show.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: This is one of the few anime's where I have actually purchased the soundtrack and listened through to the very end. I rarely ever do this and that definitely says something about the soundtrack. Not to mention the God-given anime music composer Yoko Kanno worked on this. So of course the music is phenomenal. \\n\\n\r\nNow the enjoyment factor of this show is going to vary person to person because for some people this show will feel slow and uninteresting which I gathered from asking many people who also watched the show. For some people this show is going to be very interesting and suspenseful which it was for me. I was never bored and I always wanted to see what happened next. This is an amazing show. But for some of you, there is a possibility that this show is going to be very boring and annoying. I can't say this for myself but I can speak for the people who have seen the show and have disliked it. Overall I say you should at least check it out and give it the 3 episode rule.",

I came into it knowing it share the creator with Cowboy Bebop and for this reason I was very exited, although at the end it was a very different experience of what I was expecting. \r\nThe presentation of the show is great. The looks are amazing, it has a beautiful animation that combines perfectly with the realistic art style that make the show feel more serious, and the amount of scenes that include wind movement make it feelrelaxing, contrasting with the really stressful situation that the characters are living. It might as well be one of the most cinematic animes ever, with great \u201ccinematography\u201d and melodic tracks that string along perfectly with the plot.\\n\r\nThe characters end up being very superficial, specially the females that just \u201cexist\u201d, this is the major let down of the show. \\n\r\nThe strong part of the plot is the mystery that the show creates, and the way the characters resolve difficult situations with wits. This makes for a great thriller with a plot about terrorism that is original and interesting. \\n",

            "content": "Since this is a review for those wishing to see it or not, this will be Spoiler-Free\r\nAh, Zankyou No Terror, how I loved you from Episode one to the very last episode and adore this show to no end. Was much fun for this season.\r\nHowever, this is a review and I will grade it from the average Anime watcher's perspective and detach myself from it. Despite my first Review, feel free to criticize me.\r\nMy review in a nutshell: \r\nAll in All, Terror in Resonance is an aesthetically pleasing show from the art, the animation, the way the camera shots are lined up and crafted combinedwith an interesting take on terrorism. However, certain aspects of the characters and the writing having major flaws will detract from how much you may enjoy the show and how far your suspension of disbelief will go.   \\n\\n\r\nLong Review: I do my ratings based off of five categories. \\n\\n\r\nDirection(Cinematography): 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you wish to find my rating for the plot, go down, this is something that needs to be discussed.\\n\\n\r\nWatanabe is at it again. You know when watching an Anime, you may find the bland or usual camera shot occupying the screen. Or never trying to break the norm. However, when you see shows like Bebop or Samurai Champloo, you notice special detail are placed in each shot for the characters and how every single shot leads to the next seamlessly and never feeling forced at all.\\n\\n\r\nAnother example as to why this got a ten is as a director, you choose the camera shots and HOW you tell a story. I'll get to the actual story in a moment but the matter of how Watanabe worked with the script and managed to make every shot count in eleven episodes was great work. I can't imagine someone else directing this anime and doing the kind of work he's done. \\n\\n\r\nOne key part to remember, Watanabe makes sure that not every scene needs to have an explosion and understand that these characters have life and their own special moments. Those who love directing and camera work would adore what techniques Watanabe did and when you see the story rating I gave, you'll understand exactly why. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10: \\n\\n\r\nNormally, sound is something that's considered an afterthought, never putting much emphasis on it. The original Sailor Moon played the opening theme but changed the composition in the episode and played it over and over again tot he point of redudancy. Or Code Geass having such a low variety of music to play during scenes.Sometimes when a good song plays up, it is EMPHASIZED HIGHLY and detracts from the scene. Normally they get rated lower since it doesn't add anything. \\n\\n\r\nSo why is this a ten? Cause of one person.\\n\\n\r\nYoko Kanno.\\n\\n\r\nOriginally when I heard the music, I was perplexed and didn't understand the very message. When I spent time to dedicate the body of work and listen for what it is, it put a smile on my face and brought me to a surreal atmosphere where I may sit down and play the album. From the first track starting with a heavily ridden guitar riff to a bass in the background providing this eerie mood, you sense dread. The next track, Von, plays and gives this frail, emotionally moving piece to the heart. The whole album sounds greatly pieced together but what about in context to the anime?\\n\\n\r\nAh, there's the fun in it. Watanabe and Kanno worked together on Bebop and Kids on the Slope, bringing Anime fans to rejoice at new music composed by her. In this anime, every musical piece is there for the viewer to notice and be astounded at the way it compliments the scene. Never does the music overpower the viewer or explicitly say, THIS IS SAD, CRY! Or what a happy mood. Each scene when placed with music matches the tension, atmosphere and feeling that very scene was meant to represent. There's no better way to explain this than watching the show and knowing how every scene plays out with the song there to add to the magic. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was consistent and the sound effects were top notch for what it is. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nI haven't seen something so graphically pleasing to the eyes since Garden of Words and this is an anime, not a movie. An eleven episode anime holding its quality from day one to the end without dropping deserves a praise. The characters are drawn properly and special detail went into the facial expressions. One thing as an artist that's hard, is to replicate human emotions or be sure the emotion can be felt. I would always know how a character would feel from their small nuance or body actions. \\n\\n\r\nThen this show show us gorgeously crafted scenes of buildings falling down or a very touching scene in Episode four that also got recognition from fans and critics for being breathtaking. The Art is what I would expect for a show in 2014 and not something I feel anime studios try to short change directors and give them a 2007 budget. \\n\\n\r\nSo Aesthetically it is beautiful and well crafted from an artist point of view. However, I got two more ratings to give.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10- Despite my love for the characters, I must detach myself from the show and see how they are. We have Sphinx, two males who create this group. Nine and Twelve. Then you have a female protagonist named Lisa Mishima and a detective called Shibazaki. I can describe each character in one sentence. \\n\\n\r\nNine: The intelligent, determined terrorist. \\n\\n\r\nTwelve: An aloof, care free male who seems far more intrigued at his surroundings than the actual plan his partner in crime is.\\n\\n\r\nLisa Mishima: The shy, depressed school girl who gets tangled up in the mess.\\n\\n\r\nShibazaki: An ace detective who was placed in Archives only to be brought back onto this case regarding terrorism.\\n\\n\r\nThe rating is low in part to how this show creates these characters and you don't see much character progression or development from them. \\n\\n\r\nAT ALL!\\n\\n\r\nEven then, it's minimal.\\n\\n\r\nWithout development, one would argue that they are one dimensional and I would agree. They don't vary much from episode one to episode eleven, they stay the same. Another character comes into the mix later on and when you expect progress, it doesn't. \\n\\n\r\nThere might be moments you ask yourself why this is happening or this is out of character for them. While one may see things differently, as a regular viewer, one would be outright annoyed by the changes of events and the writings. Oh, and speaking of the writing.\\n\\n\r\nWriting(Plot): 5/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, the reason why the cinematography gets a praise here, was how damn elegant on HOW Watanabe TOLD the story. One may create a story about them walking up a flight of stairs but the PRESENTATION of it can captivate you. The way the director tells the story saves this from becoming a very bland and uninspiring show. Hence, if another director came to do this story, it would flop tremendously.\\n\\n\r\nThat is the reason why I didn't mix the two together, it has to be separated.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself has a clear message, a theme to everyone and specifically for Japan. Let's say this, the plot was evident but the way it is executed, handled and crafted to the viewer.....is wonderful. That does not excuse the fact that it is still a very sub par plot. \\n\\n\r\nOne needs to pay full attention to every bit of their surroundings or they might fall behind. Another problem can be the fact that this anime doesn't Spoon feed you information. That's fine. \\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, I see others asking very trivial questions that are explained but no one was paying much attention. This is a fast paced directive anime. Combine this with a short eleven episodes and one thing will suffer. The plot, or the writing. \\n\\n\r\nThis show had 4, no not two not three... FOUR writers working on it. There'll be discrepancies on actions or details. Combine with some plot holes to why doesn't this happen or this happen. Why is this person acting nice all of a sudden, why did they blow up this area?\\n\\n\r\nI might sound childish but you'll find some flaws and when you hit episode five and seven, your suspension of belief will be tested to the brink. This show has answers but one must peak and observe carefully but when one's trying to just watch the show for what it is without paying much attention, these details slip and take the viewer out of the experience. Combine this with suspension of belief getting tested and head scratching moments like, really, couldn't they have done this instead, brings this to such a lower score. \\n\\n\r\nAdding these points up, \\n\r\n10\\n\r\n10\\n\r\n10\\n\r\n5\\n\r\n5 =\\n\r\n40/50\\n\\n\r\nAn Eight.\\n\\n\r\nThis Anime owned potential to be one of the best all time and owned great ambition. It suffered in time and gets demoted to an eight. If every Anime can strive to be like this show with ideas or the quality of its direction, I'll be a happy man and be worth watching Anime far more often. For now, it suffers from the script and it will show after episode four. \\n\\n\r\nThis score can also be subtracted by 1-3 judging by the characters and writing. I still stand that the direction, sound and art is worthy of a ten and makes me think we're in 2014. The writing and characters are the downfall and will affect each and every viewer differently. \\n\\n\r\nWho this show IS MEANT for: Those wishing for a thriller or suspense in their hobbies. A Political theme running about. Those who loves to think deeply and find meanings in every scene by the director. Those who likes outside sources....cinematography analysis, plot analysis, shot analysis\\n\\n\r\nWho's this show's NOT MEANT for: Nitpickers, short suspension of belief, those who despise terrorism. Those with very short attention spans or not paying closely to the scene. Those looking for a fun time. There's fun to be had but the show's color instantly brings a sense of dread and morbid atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the end of the review, hoped you had fun reading this. Till another show pops up.\\n\\n\r\nBang!",

            "content": "Zankyou no Terror, known in English as Terror in Resonance, was one of the most popular anime of the summer 2014 anime season. Many even went so far as to call it the best anime of this year. While this 11 episode anime series has many good points, is it really that outstanding? \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nZankyou no Terror is about two teenage boys, Nine and Twelve, who are the two members of a terrorist organization called Sphinx. The city of what seems to be present-day Tokyo becomes the victim of a terrorist attack caused by none other than Sphinx. At this time, a girl named LisaMishima becomes their accomplice in exchange for her life. Sphinx begins to make and post puzzling YouTube-like videos, announcing information through riddles about how to prevent the bomb going off, where it is located, etc. However, these riddles require a lot of intellect to solve. A detective named Shibazaki Kenjirou is apparently the only person in the entirety of japan who can solve these riddles. As the show progresses, the motives of each individual character are revealed and attempts to answer many questions that, in a lot of anime like this, are left unanswered.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall plot of ZNT is extremely creative and rather surprising. I, personally, have never seen another anime focusing solely on Terrorism. The first half of the series, while somewhat repetitive, got me very excited for each episode and left me wanting more with each week.  However, after about the midway point, it began to randomly throw plot twists at you in the form of slightly boring information dumps. Despite this, it never fails keeps you interested all the way through. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSince the first episode, it was evident how high the animation budget was. There is not one moment that I remember when the art and animation looked less than fantastic. The character designs made each person memorable. The art and animation might have been one of best parts about this show.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST, composed by Yoko Kanno, was stunning. Each and every song was beautiful and perfectly matched the overall tone of the show. Tracks such as \"Von\", \"Walt\", and \"Is\" we're some of my favorites. Both the opening and ending were both visually and audibly amazing. The voice acting was very good as well, showing emotion in all of the scenes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the part in which the show falls kind of flat. The two protagonists, Nine and Twelve, each had their own flaws. Nine, to me, felt underdeveloped throughout the majority of the series. He mostly seemed to remain a stoic lump without ever changing much until the end, where most of his development felt rushed and forced. I do have to give him props, though, because he stayed mostly consistent the whole way through.\\n\\n\r\nTwelve had the opposite problem. Although he was developed, he was not consistent. At the beginning of the anime he seemed rather playful (in a somewhat creepy way) and had obvious hints toward possible insanity. But later, at around the fourth or fifth episode, he became less of an insane teenaged terrorist and more of the knight in shining armor who always came to save Lisa while riding on a white stallion (or in his case, a motorcycle.) After his entire characterization changes, his new self is the one that is developed properly.\\n\\n\r\nLisa was basically a huge danger magnet. Everywhere she went, she seemed to get into some kind of trouble. Not that that was necessarily a bad thing. You could see her slowly become braver as the anime progressed. She was by far one of my favorites in the series. \\n\\n\r\nAfter the main three, there are two more side characters worth mentioning. Shibazaki, while smart and interesting, felt underdeveloped and rather stereotypical as a detective. But my main problem with the characters is Five. I won't go too much into her character, because that would be leading into huge spoiler territory, but let me just say that I found her unnecessary to the entire plot. In the end, she didn't even make a difference in anything. She was probably the worst character in the ZNT.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite everything, I still enjoyed every second of the show and would defiantly watch it again.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.83/10 (rounded up to 9)\\n\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror, while flawed, is surely not a show to look over! I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys psychological and thriller anime. \\n",

            "content": "Being a Watanabe project, and his first since Sakamichi no Apollon, Zankyou no Terror was always going to fall victim to the \"hype train\". However, now that months have past since the series has finished airing, it's now possible to review this anime series without having the over-reactions and other influences that hype trains entail. \r\nThe first few episodes of this series are executed well. The first episode focuses on the two young terrorists as they carry out a terrorist attack on an office building. This episode is fast paced, well directed, intense and sets the bar high for the series. The next episode detailsthe aftermath of the terrorist attack, before the next terrorist attack happens, this time with a riddle involved for the police to solve. Again, like the pilot, the second episode is just as intense. But one odd thing is mentioned; the idea that the terrorist attack in the first episode didn't kill anyone. While at the time this wasn't a major issue, it was the first moment where it seemed the show could be flawed.\\n\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror continues over the next two episodes in a similar vein to the previous two, but then episode five comes along. Here, they decide to throw a spanner in the works; a new antagonist is introduced. Having a new antagonist isn't always a bad thing, however in this case there isn't much time to develop another character and the new antagonist is almost cartoonishly evil (there's a minor explanation of her personality later on, but it isn't enough to excuse her antics). This ruins the grounded feel the anime had over the previous episodes.\\n\\n\r\nNow with a new antagonist, Zankyou no Terror spends the next few episodes focused on the random antics of the antagonist instead of exploring the themes and characters introduced in the first few episodes. When these antics are finished, it's already the last episode of the show. Hence, this is the situation that's left when the series concludes (without spoilers):\\n\\n\r\n- The main duo never get developed past being savants with a bad past\\n\r\n- Lisa is completely insignificant to the plot\\n\r\n- The second antagonist's actions didn't affect the overall plot, nor did they help convey any message \\n\r\n- Shibazaki is the same as he was in the beginning of the series\\n\r\n- The terrorist attacks are portrayed as harmless when clearly many people would have been affected\\n\r\n- Any commentary on issues such as the lasting effects of nuclear bombings, USA's influence on Japan and general government corruption are rushed through, leaving no impact on anyone watching.\\n\\n\r\nBut there are still some positives to Zankyou no Terror that lasted for longer than the first four episodes of the show; the cinematography, animation quality and soundtrack. The most notable is the music, done by Yoko Kanno (known for Cowboy Bebop as well as many other anime). The soundtrack is perhaps one of the best I have ever heard; enhancing every scene and aspect of the show and is good enough to listen to over and over as a stand alone album. As for the animation quality, everything is fluid and of a high production value from beginning to end. It is clear that great care was taken for the technical aspects of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was ever an anime that would be described as \"wasted potential\", Zankyou no Terror is it. With everything going well for the first third of the series, it's disappointing to see things fall apart as they did. Since two thirds of the show are fairly frustrating to watch, I can't recommend Zankyou no Terror to anyone. However, if you are set on watching the show, it won't be the worst experience ever as there are far worse shows out there. Sadly, there may not be another anime focused on terrorism for a long time.",

            "content": "\"Remember us. Remember that we lived.\" \r\nZankyou no Terror is the one anime that upset me just as much as Clannad and Clannad: after story did. I'm not quite sure how or why it hit me so hard in the gut, but it did. \r\nTwelve was the easily lovable character of the show; bubbly, cute but also scary. Nine was like he was wearing a mask even when he wasn't making riddles for the public. However, as the episodes went on, you could really see the pain in not just Nine but Twelve too. \r\nLisa was a lovely part of Zankyou no Terror, I think.A lot of people didn't like her but she added to the story in a way which caused Twelve and Nine to grow as characters. We saw a different side to them. Twelve insisting he wouldn't get too involved and Nine seeing just that happen right in front of him. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I wasn't too keen on was how it ended (and I think a lot of people will agree with me on that one). I feel it could've ended a little differently, but maybe that's just me being a sad little fangirl who refuses to accept what happened. \\n\\n\r\nI also want to talk about the music. I've never heard anything more beautiful than the soundtracks for Zenkyou no Terror, which made the story even more harsh on our emotions. It fit perfectly with the atmosphere and the setting of the anime and I'm deeply impressed. \\n\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror is an anime about seeking. It isn't about terrorism. The journey and hardships that come with trying to find hope (VON in Icelandic) is what makes this anime so special to me. \\n\\n\r\n\"It's a pale yellow. Your voice.\"\\n",

            "content": "Zankyou no Terror was one of those anime that everyone seemed to have an eye on when it was previewed. Not only was it an anime original (which we don't get too many of these days), but it also was directed by Shinichiro Watanabe and looked visually stunning. \r\nPersonally, the thing that piqued my interest was the simple concept of terrorism being a main focal point, which doesn't get looked at too often since the threat is very real in several places of the world. Not only was terrorism a main point, but it was the protagonists of the story carrying out the acts. Interestingenough. With that in mind, the question being thought going in to this anime was \"What would it do with this concept?\".\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAs stated above and in the synopsis, the series protagonists calling themselves \"Sphinx\" carry out acts of terrorism without harming anyone in an attempt to accomplish something that gets explained later on. The first couple episodes of Zankyou no Terror were gripping, leaving the viewer wanting to watch more. It seemed like a great idea, having Sphinx lay out a riddle for the people of Tokyo to either solve or suffer the consequences while using Greek mythology to explain more about Sphinx themselves.\\n\\n\r\nIt's worth to note that the antagonist of the first couple episodes is a recently reinstated detective named Shibazaki. He's the only one who seems to understand Sphinx's riddles, but it works. He's the counter to Sphinx. Someone of equal intelligence who isn't afraid to disobey orders for the greater good. Unfortunately, Zankyou no Terror does something wrong with this and the series begins to go downhill with the introduction of a new antagonist. More on that later...\\n\\n\r\nAnother subtle problem I had with the anime story was the ending. In one of the final scenes, I feel like everything was happening a little too conveniently. As in, this happened RIGHT as this happened, RIGHT as this happened and it drew away from the mood the scene was trying to set.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror is visually stunning for the most part. Every scene in the anime is very well animated and there are few uses of still shots, which lots of anime use as a kind of \"get out of jail free\" card. The art style is able to blend well the bright, vibrant colours of summer, with the rather cold, and realistic colours of the characters. This helps improve the overall feeling and emotion present in almost any given scene. Also, the animation of the snowmobile scene in the very first episode was spectacular and noteworthy in it's own right.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST of this anime was composed by Yoko Kanno, so that basically speaks for itself. It is absolutely beautiful, and the choice of music used for each scene is spot on. The music drives home the tone and emotion of the scene it is used in and left me waiting for the official release of the soundtrack for an immediate download.\\n\\n\r\nOther than background music, the generic sounds were well done. Explosions, gunshots, and the like were not overly jarring and same goes for the other sounds. Not much more to say about that.\\n\\n\r\nI would have rated the sound category higher, but there was one more thing to look in to. That would be voice acting. Everyone who has seen the show knows where I'm going with this, so I'll just say the usage of English in some of the scenes was not entirely necessary and took away some of the immersion from the show. Can't blame the actors for that, it was just a poor choice to use it in general when it could have been avoided.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of ZnT were for the most part not too, too out of the ordinary. We have Sphinx #1, better known as Nine. The tall, dark, and mysterious young man who puts the current objective before any other aspect of life. He refuses to get close to others as they may just get in the way, with the exception of his partner, Sphinx #2, Twelve. Twelve is the opposite of Nine in the sense that he is a lot more easy going. He wanders around and cracks jokes, while still taking the current operation seriously.\\n\\n\r\nOther than Sphinx, there is the character Lisa, an introverted high school girl with an extremely over protective mother, causing a ton of stress on her. She eventually gets involved with Sphinx due to a \"Become an accomplice or die\" situation. Nothing out of the ordinary with Lisa's character, although it can be said that she probably goes through the most character development throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, my main gripe with this show. The characters Shibazaki, and Five. Shibazaki as I said earlier is a detective who got so obsessed with his last case that he was demoted into the archives department. Throughout the first couple episodes he is asked to come back and work on the Sphinx case. You can see his intrigue in them, his desire to stop them, to learn about them. You can see him getting re-obsessed. We already knew how much he could get into a case and how far he was willing to go to solve it. Just as I felt Shibazaki was about to repeat his past mistakes, he gets put on the back burner for a new, boring antagonist, Five.\\n\\n\r\nFive is a bland character, who's only motive for anything whatsoever is getting back at Nine for something in the past. Revenge. Because revenge is original. Five steps in and engages in \"intellectual\" battles with Sphinx to try and stop them. And by \"intellectual\" I mean chess, because chess is apparently a suitable showcasing of a challenge between intellects which in the modern day is bordering on the cliche. However, Five is willing to go to any lengths to get her way. Whether that is becoming a threat to innocent civilians or not. \\n\\n\r\nWhile she is doing this, Shibazaki is used for the sole purpose of exposing the mysteries of Sphinx's origins. A total waste of potential.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of the problems I had with this show, the pros outweigh the cons. I still found myself anticipating the next episodes arrival, and had a good time watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror was a very good show, but shy of being \"great\". The beginning was extremely strong, and the ending was satisfactory, but the lackluster middle section and the waste of potential character development brought down my opinion of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Zankyou no Terror is definitely worth the watch, and I give it a high recommendation to those wondering if they should watch it and those leaning towards not watching it.",

            "content": "*Spoiler Warning* (also this is something I typed a while ago just after I finished the show so it\u2019s a little old but still was my honest opinion) I just finished Zankyou no Terror. It was a journey to say the least, I saw no flaws in the characters and I am holding back tears as I type this. It is a bittersweet ending that I partially saw coming but didn\u2019t want it to happen. After 5 died I had suspicions that it was possible that the drugs had shortened their lives as well as the other children\u2019s. I noticed a definite tone shift inthe show after 5s airport thing. I noticed that the music became more somber, especially after she fell ill during the ferris wheel part.  The tone shifts as you realize that they were dying the whole time and wanted to tell the world exactly what happened to them, they didn\u2019t want to hurt anyone, they just wanted their story to be out there and them just saying it wouldn't get it out there. They needed people to wonder who exactly sphinx was and why they did what they did, thus when the information finally came out they I could spread to the world, so that they knew of the atrocities that this organization had committed. It is something that is honorable; however I don\u2019t blame the scientists for what they did. There are many medicines that we have made through human testing. Though it is horrible it is a something necessary for scientific exploration. Da Vinci dug up dead bodies in order to survey their organs and bones; this was atrocious at the time and was considered a huge crime. However now we do autopsies after every death. Sacrifices to your humanity are made when you want to experiment for the betterment of society. The logic that the show uses with Japan being weak is unfounded. Japan controls technology, and other industries. Though it is not as massively successful as China. What this reminds me of most is the things that were done to the Spartans in the Halo novels. Spartan ones were all either disfigured or dead after the experiments, but the information gained after them fueled the Spartan 2 project which saw a 50-50 success rate when it was completed, though they were conducted under less than savory terms. Children were abducted at 5 due to their gifted abilities and were taken to a boot camp where they trained until they were teens, at which point they were modified with technology and performed as super soldiers, later gaining armor. After this the Spartan 3s came along which were more successful and took less time due to growth hormones. Finally Spartan 4s came along which essentially replaced the normal military due to the success rate. The point of this is that in science sacrifices are made, that is why we test on rats and monkeys before we test on humans to have minimal human sacrifice. There are two sides to everything though, so this show serves to show the other side. All in all this was an amazing anime which gets a 9 out of 10. It isn\u2019t my absolute favorite but it left an impression on me that won\u2019t be leaving anytime soon.",

            "content": "Probably the only anime watched by the NSA, \"Terror in Resonance\" is the type of show that only comes around every few years; the kind that reminds you why you watch anime while everyone else watches balls being kicked down a field, or balls in general. It takes you back to the realization that all anime isn't artistic absurdity, but provides an extreme twist on reality that makes you think, brings you closer to the edge of sanity and maybe even truth. Despite being a thriller about extremism---in fear of a more taboo word that'll get us on a watch-list---Zankyou no Terror manages to bemore profound than it is dire, and far more heartfelt than it is heartless. A complex product, this review focuses on what makes this show stand out.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing two brilliant young zealots calling themselves \"Sphinx\" aiming to blow up Japan, the story is a chain reaction between law enforcement, the public, and outside governments trying to apprehend Sphinx. The first difference between Terror In Resonance and other shows claiming to have \"brilliant\" characters is that these ones seem to actually know things. Before each detonation, Sphinx gives a riddle, a classical mythological or philosophical enigma to be solved in order to reveal the location of the next bomb. Not only is the solving of riddles a potent spark for character development, but it's also a rational process; practically every episode informs the audience of something worldly, and despite the story's bombastic frequency, the show never falls into the trappings of stagnation, unlike the puns being made here.  Instead, a rather methodical beginning turns into a heart-racing second half, which could throw some viewers off. From Law and Order straight to Mission Impossible, Zankyou no Terror might not be consistent, but it is entertaining. Every intelligent development is unexpected. \\n\\n\r\nAlmost everything in Zankyou no Terror is a subversion of its apparent genre. From the team of investigators, featuring the middle-aged Sherlock-figure Shibazaki at the helm, one might assume it's yet another \"catch the villain\" narrative. However, the viewer learns quickly that our bombers, Nine and Twelve, are not the one-note villains that other shows might portray. They're youthful, naive, and their devotion to their mysterious motives are the driving force of the show, not the solving of their riddles. Additionally, Lisa, a civilian girl who gets involved in their plot, further humanizes them and turns an otherwise stony cast into a lively one, just with her innate power of kawaii. Though by no means an interesting character in her own right, her function elevates the show above other thrillers, and forms the most memorable scenes. Admittedly, while it makes sense why she admires Nine and Twelve, the public's sub cultural admiration for Sphix doesn't make any sense whatsoever. It's like clapping for two guys who just urinated in your cheerios just because you hate cereal companies. In the end your cheerios are still soggy, so unless you really hate dry cheerios...you probably shouldn't side with the zealots. It's not a big plot point, but it doesn't make sense.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically, too,  you're looking at a higher-than-average production, where the backgrounds are beautifully rendered and realistic, despite the animation sometimes appearing linear.  The animation sometimes looks too line-y, like it was chiseled and not sanded. It certainly could be a stylistic choice, but it's too inconsistent in the subdued scenes, despite the action moving extremely well. Subdued, in fact, is a fine way to describe the art in general, adding to the realism which is contradicted only in the most powerful of scenes. During these scenes, though, it won't be the crisp visuals that steal the show, it'll be the wonderful soundtrack. Don't skip the opening, for it captures the essence perfectly. Vocal tracks, both English and Japanese, dominate the most iconic scenes which won't be spoiled here. A small double edged sword between artistry and realism follows, in which Engrish creeps its way into your ears. You can't fault it for that because bilingualism is awesome.\\n\\n\r\nWhat one can find in Zankyou No Terror is the kind of anime that used to be. In no other medium would you find an animated show about two young extremists out to haunt a nation, and have that show be all at once heart-pounding as it is subdued, as well as romantically classical in more ways than one. It isn't anime for the sake of being anime, or ridiculous because it's allowed be; it's realistic until it can't be, whereupon it becomes artistic and conveys something. It's mature, exemplifying why anime became popular in the West, and this reviewer can't recommend it heartily enough. \\n\\n\r\nSimilar shows: Death Note, Monster, Cowboy Bebop, Serial Experiments Lain, Texnolyze.\\n",

            "content": "Whether it'd be dealing with school life or a world wide threat (Code Geass, Evangelion, Attack on Titan), the future always seems to lie in the hands of teenagers. In anime, this is understandable for teens are its main demographic. The question is, is the show still able to take itself seriously when its whole premise lies on a serious topic? Terror has been a very real, relevant topic for the past decade. It's still horrifying to recall the first video ISIS released of a man getting his head chopped off. \r\nThe majority of the people divide this series into two parts: Pre-5 and Post-5(you'll understand when you see it) with Pre-5 arc showing great promise while post-5 losing the audience. I had major problems with post-5 arc but I also had problems with pre-5 arc as well. Watanabe clearly aimed to portray a REALISTIC view of a world affected by terror as shown by the characters designed to actually resemble Japanese people and delving into actual international conflicts and actually using two languages to show diplomatic interactions. So taking the subject of terror but treating the issue like a game of chess/ cat & mouse chase with \"pop quizzes\" is problematic and frankly, silly. Again, I hold it accountable for this series only--I didn't have a problem with this in series like Code Geass because that fully embraced the unrealistic aspects of anime but Zankyou no Terror did not. \\n\\n\r\nPost-5 arc: The series fell drastically in terms of story and character development here. First, I never liked Lisa. She didn't change throughout the series and literally contributed nothing to the show except bringing needless danger to the main 2 protagonists. While not resorting to fanservice is admirable, it doesn't automatically warrant a good female character. I was very disappointed with 12 as well. The intro and this one dialogue he said was chilling for he seemed like one of those seemingly calm characters that would go berserk when the time was right. I don't even think I have to mention 5--people will see the problem. The ending was contrived without even being conclusive. As someone whose main criteria is story/character development, it's already hard giving a high score to most anime but this one failed. Overall, it was too stagnant, too random, and too contrived.\\n\\n\r\nthis next sentence is SPOILER: at the end of episode 4, when Lisa ended the episode with, \"are you going to destroy the whole world\" I sat in my chair in awe as it showed SO much potential. Now i know in hindsight that that was the climax of the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was great though. The best one in 2014. Von, saga, lololol, and walt are especially awesome.\\n\\n\r\nIN CONCLUSION, if Watanabe intended to convey something meaningful via Zankyou no Terror, he was way too subtle with it. I read on ANN that the show was a critique on xenophobia and isolationist policy of Japan. I didn't pick up on that at all and I don't think it was because the show was \"too smart.\" I give credit to the show for exploring a rare theme but the execution was poor and that's that.  It's just sad and disappointing.",

            "content": "The plot progression was slow, the writing was sub-par and the characters came off as empty due to poorly plotted character depth. The building up to the climax was slow and tedious, mostly because the key draw of the show was tied to our main cast whom I didn\u2019t really care about and who were hardly developed along the way; which raises a problem for me with TiR (Terror in Resonance): Sacrificing character development while trying to tell a story that is character-driven. In doing so it shot itself in the foot since the message of this show depends on the character depth of thecast. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the journey of TiR it raised a lot of questions to hook us, a great deal of which aren\u2019t answered until the last episode. A lot of these questions deal with our protagonists, Nine and Twelve. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story revolves around Sphinx, an anonymous organization consisting of Nine and Twelve, who are supposed to be these troubled but exceptionally smart teens that want to send a message to the world, and they\u2019re willing to use bombs and threats to do it. They want the world to know about the bad things that happened to them in their past, and that isn\u2019t revealed until the last few episodes. Throughout the series we are clued in that that message has to do with their troubled pasts via flashbacks and brief dialogues between them. \\n\\n\r\nBecause we know so little about any character throughout this series I found it hard to care about any of them. The few clues we have of their lives are mostly visual in nature, or by their interactions with other characters who are equally (if not more) lacking in depth. \\n\\n\r\nNine is pretty much the cold calculative guy, but he\u2019s not as cold as Lelouch (from Code Geass) or Light Yagami (from Death Note). This is ironic because you would think it would take heartless resolve to use bombs in public places to get people\u2019s attention. You undoubtedly risk killing, or at the very least injuring, people in the process. This is supposed to be eased off by the fact that our protagonists are super smart. This, however, leaves the question lingering of whether or not they, being as smart as they are, could\u2019ve found a better alternative.\\n\\n\r\nTwelve is the polar opposite of Nine in how he relates to others; he\u2019s still just as smart though. As a person, he\u2019s fairly happy-go-lucky and care-free. I suppose that\u2019s meant to identify his innocence or underdeveloped character. He doesn\u2019t seem to have any goals of his own; he\u2019s pretty much attached to Nine out of some sense of camaraderie and came off as more of a loyal dog than a friend.  It isn\u2019t until near the end of the show that his desires become clearer.\\n\\n\r\nLisa is pretty much an average girl who gets mixed up with Sphinx because she was stuck between a rock and a hard place (partly because of Twelve, the rest because of personal issues dealing with her home and school environment). She doesn\u2019t fit in in terms of smarts, but she has one thing in common with them; loneliness. She acts as a medium to help flesh out the characters of nine and twelve more concerning their relations with people who aren\u2019t like them.  \\n\\n\r\nFive is a crazy chick from Sphinx\u2019s past who is obsessed with beating Nine in a game of intellect and will do so using any means necessary. She works with the US Government to help put an end to Sphinx. Her purpose seemed to form a contrast between herself and Sphinx in terms of their morality. Apart from that, her character made no sense, resulting in a superficial and meaningless entity. No surprise considering she received zero development throughout the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nShibazaki is the detective working on bringing Sphinx to justice. He acts more as plot tool to help us understand Sphinx more than anything else. \\n\\n\r\nThe climax of the story felt empty. I found myself asking \u201cWhat was the point? Did Sphinx have to go to such extremes just to get that message across? Was it worth it?\u201d and also, \u201cFor being so smart you\u2019d have thought they would find a less risky alternative to meet their goals.\u201d My conclusion is that it wasn\u2019t a reasonable story; some of their actions didn\u2019t match the characterizations they were meant to portray.  That lack of reason from a show that seems to want to emulate reason is what put the nail in the coffin for me.   \\n\\n\r\nI would not recommend this show to anyone who cares about character depth or plot. I wouldn\u2019t even recommend it to someone who doesn\u2019t, simply because the show takes itself seriously. If I recommended it to anyone, it would be as an example of poor execution. \\n",

            "content": "Zankyou no Terror (English title \"Terror in Resonance\") is an 11-episode anime directed by Shinichir\u014d Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop, Space Dandy) that aired during the Summer of 2014. It is a mystery/thriller series with animation done by the studio MAPPA. \r\n  ~Story~\r\n    I think my favorite thing about this series' story and plot is the topics it deals with. It discusses topics not dealt with commonly in anime, such as terrorism and social interactions. While terrorism is a main theme in this particular anime,  it also focuses on how people react in dire situations. However, I do believe there were afew plot holes. The series never truly explores the relationship between Lisa and her mother. While it is hinted on several occasions that her mother is possibly overbearing, it never explains why. Is her mother emotionally or physically abusive? Where is Lisa's father? Overall, I give the story a 9/10. I applaud the unconventional topics it focuses on, but I think a few things should have been explored more. \\n\\n\\n\r\n   ~Art~\\n\r\nThe animation was done by the studio MAPPA (Kids on the Slope) and character designs were done by Kazuto Nakazawa (Samurai Champloo). The animation for this series was very well done. The colors are all very sharp, and the character movements are extremely smooth. The quality of animation is consistent throughout the series, and the backgrounds and scenery are all very detailed and clean. The character designs, while not bad by any means, I feel could have been done a little better. No character's design is bland, but no character has any defining features either. The only thing that really stood out to me was Five's white hair. Overall, I give art an 8/10. Excellent animation, but the character designs could have been more detailed and/or interesting. \\n\\n\\n\r\n ~Sound~\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for this series was composed by Yoko Kanno, who is very well known for doing the soundtracks to animes such as Cowboy Bebop, and frequently collaborates with the director of this series. The soundtrack for this anime is simply incredible. Every single track sounds different and interesting. Each song fits well with the mysterious tone of the series. My personal favorite tracks are \"lolol\", \"von\", and \"fugl\". The voice acting was also very good. The opening and ending are, to put it simply, perfect. They fit extremely well with the series, and are unique and unforgettable. There is no official English dub, but I hope when one is released it does justice to the Japanese voice acting, which is quite good.\\n\r\nOverall, I give sound a 9/10.  Incredible soundtrack and voice acting.\\n\\n\\n\r\n~Character~\\n\r\nThe characters I think were the weakest part of the series. I had a particular problem with the main female character, Lisa. She has little to no character development whatsoever, and her back story is nearly unexplained. Moreover, her motives for her actions and tagging along with Nine and Twelve are only explored on a very small amount. \\n\\n\r\nNine and Twelve are the overall main characters of the series. Although they also had very little character development, their back story was explained and explored upon, which I appreciated. Both are shrouded in mystery that is never fully revealed, but I believe that is what made their characters so interesting. Overall, I give characters a 7/10. Both Nine and Twelve are likable and well-written characters, but the lack of character development and Lisa's weak character are a problem. \\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror is not a series everyone will enjoy. It also explored topics such as riddles and puzzles, which may turn off many people. However, despite these things, I was completely engrossed and mesmerized by this series. Never once while watching it was I bored. If it suits your taste, it is a very compelling show. \\n\\n\r\n~Overall~\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror by no means is a perfect series. Every show has its flaws, whether they are big or small. However, this series as a whole, in my opinion was a masterpiece. Yes, it has problems with character development, but the  unique story and brilliant sountrack make up for it. It is a haunting series which will leave you thinking hours after finishing it.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A POTENTIAL SPOILER IN THE PENULTIMATE (second last) PARAGRAPH.\r\nZankyou no Terror is a good anime. It's not the best Anime in the world, but it doesn't need to be. It might not be full of dramatic and jaw opening scenes like Death Note or investigative action scenes like Psycho-Pass, but it has its own flavor of story telling that may or may not seem clich\u00e9d to you (depending on how much anime you have seen).\r\nThe story is about two friends who are more like brothers. Nine and Twelve are on a mission to reveal to the world the deep, dark secrets thata country's government can contain. While they might be branded as terrorists initially, it is clear to the viewers that they are much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to story, this anime starts off a little slow, and doesn't reveal much until further on. But all of this simply adds to the moment and allows us to form a relationship to the 2 protagonists similar to the one Lisa Mishima develops. This all pays off towards the end (more on that later).\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was pleasant and light on the eyes. Depending on your tastes you might find it a common design. Sounds were good too, though I have heard more catchy jingles.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, while mysterious for the most part, become a little relatable as they start to interact with the various other characters in the anime. While they may not be the most memorable characters (Nine and Twelve fit the category of \"Super-smart kids that are beyond the 'system'\"), they certainly did have their own charms.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the overall score and enjoyment go hand in hand for this anime simply because the finale managed to turn what was a seemingly good anime into a very good anime (in my opinion, of course). The shock plot twist at the very end left a bitter taste in my mouth after what seemed liked an almost happy ending. It was at this moment that we could sympathize with all the other characters who had just now begun to truly understand Nine and Twelve. A plot twist like this, that rattles our core and causes us to shake our heads in disbelief, is what makes the story of Zankyou no Terror one to definitely watch if you have some spare time on your hands.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the plot never became too dull, coupled with the great finale and interesting story is what made this anime an enjoyable one. If you're thinking of checking this out, you won't be disappointed.",

            "content": "A tragic story with both action and mystery, all leading to the unveiling of a dark truth. Despite how many people seem to think, this is truly not all that original of a concept. Of course, originality isn't really necessary for a good anime, so let's see what other aspects this one is lacking in.\r\nThe one issue that seems to destroy the story before it even gets started is that it's trying too hard. I still don't know at what, but the apparent originality of the concept is definitely a part of it. At times it did provide me a fair amount of enjoyment, butI can't honestly say I felt like it was actually trying to entertain me. The humor of the show was extremely weak, a complete afterthought, the action scenes were all filled with an opressive need for dramatic effect.\\n\\n\r\nWhat was all the more apparent for that was that it wished to instill awe in the audience. It wanted to be deep, touching the viewers beyond the mere notion of 'entertainment'. That's not wrong, in fact it's enjoyable for me personally. But that's where it really falls apart; it's not plausible at all, thus failing to be 'deep' in any way at all. The suspension of disbelief is all about circumstance after all. If one wishes to tell a fantastical tale they need only take it into a fantastical setting. However, the setting of this story is the very real world with its very real problems. It is not impossible to tap into these problems for inspiration, but if you actually stage your story in such a completely established setting you need to be able to reflect the nature of that setting in your story. This anime didn't for a moment truly manage that. It hoped to depict tragedy but also hope on a massive scale; without death. Death in our world isn't a mystical thing reserved only for great occasions like the anime depicts it, bizarrely while including the legacy of the destruction in Japan following the second world war.\\n\\n\r\nThe issue of inplausibility goes beyond just the specifics of what happens in the story. It's the greatest blight of the characters of the story. In this of a supposedly the realistic world the characters can almost all be split into two categories of unbelievable. There's the ones that aren't really a part of the story, just filling in there to make it feel alive without having any purpose of their own. But more important are the core characters of the story; people that have one and all experienced tragedy that defines their roles in the story. And yet those tragedies are all just completely out of this world ridiculous or just normal things taken to stupid extents. I wish I could have related to the main characters, I really do, but that would have required a plausible explanation for what happened to them beyond 'humans are bad'.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that partly saves the story for me is Shibazaki; the single believable and relatable character in the story. One with real problems for which he looks real solutions, unlike the rest of the cast. A fine character, but not really great, he kept up the believability of the story long enough for me to enjoy most of it before I started actually thinking. Problem is, I started thinking before the end; which made the conclusion of the series fall completely flat.\\n\\n\r\nThe technical aspects of the show were more successful, though they suffer partly for the same problem as the story, of trying to be more than they are. The art quality was good, and fitting for the story that the show tried to depict, and animation were also very solid. Yet the way it's implemented reeks of attempted artistic signifigance where there was none. As such, the 'dreamy' feel that it attempts ends up simply a weak distortion of reality like the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound quality was overall good as well. The music were perhaps even better than that, but on the other hand the attempted English voice acting broke the immersion on more than one occasion. I'd like to give credit for the fact that the 'engrish' wasn't as terrible as it could be, but I can't ignore the fact that it's also far from how native speakers that they tried to depict actually sound.\\n\\n\r\nThe combination of all these aspects ends up with a completely unmemorable show where it clearly looked to be a dramatic and memorable story. Despite this I can't say I didn't find the show enjoyable to an extent, to start with at least. It was a fair bit of fun as long as I didn't apply any critical thinking to it. In the case of a show that hopes to be intelligent this really isn't praise, but there's at least the fact that the show wasn't memorable for being particularly bad either.\\n\\n\r\n*sigh*\\n\\n\r\nThis is the kind of anime that offered me a decent amount of enjoyment as I watched it, but left me thoroughly unimpressed after the end. It kept up the appearances of intellect, but the more you actually look at it the more it really falls apart. And in the end, even as it clearly doesn't fall in the 'category' of intelligent, it still in fact believes it does. Further it takes itself deadly serious no matter how unbelievable the things it depicts. This is what I'd call pretentious - and I love a lot of stories that many others would call that.",

            "content": "This anime is just.. completely legendary. It brought out some new emotions that I've never felt before. At first, I never was interested in this anime AT ALL, but then I saw some wicked edits of it on Vine and the animation seemed pretty unique so I thought I should try it out. Woah boy, I did NOT expect the emotional train ride I just signed myself up for.\r\nStory: The story really is quite captivating, I could not stop watching each episode and finished this whole series in one sitting. As you can see from the summary of the animation, it is based on thecorruption of the world's government. Though it may seem like a boring subject to base anime on, do not be fooled because as you watch more and more of it, you realize that there is much more that goes on, but I won't spoil it for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Well, the art is just absolutely gorgeous. For an animation, it really made me feel like these things were realistic because of how precise all the character's facial expressions were and how the bombings turned out. It felt like I was watching a true situation being laid out before me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I can only describe it in one word and that is: Indie. The soundtrack consisted of songs that are not popular in today's music industry and consisted of a lot of instruments, especially the acoustics in sentimental scenes. Although it's a new sensation to anime, it does not fail to compliment and enhance the emotion of each scene. But then, oh lordy, THE VOICE ACTORS. Big round of applause to those talented people. Their voices were just perfect, I have no complaint because they were mostly the reason why I cried and felt a rush of new emotions because of the passion they have in making their characters come to life.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Although you do not get into too much background of where they came from, what they do in their current time just completely shapes their character and you get a good feel of how demented some characters' pasts were. None of the characters are the ones that you typically come by, these characters have far more sides to them than come to the eye, and that's what makes them so fascinating and captivating.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: As you can see, I have no complaints whatsoever and although I experienced quite some depressing emotions, I absolutely have not regrets over it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: So the basics of what I'm saying is that YES. I DEFINITEY RECOMMEND YOU TO WATCH THIS. Coming from a person that's been strictly Shoujo for 8 years, that's really a lot as this anime is way out of my league but nevertheless did not fail to make an impression on me. I'd definitely want to watch this over and over and over again.",

            "content": "Zankyou no Terror is one of those rare short series (at only 11 episodes) that clearly conveys its plot and message clearly with little divergence from the main story line and contains a fulfilling ending. I can honestly say there are only a few series less than 15 episodes that have left me as satisfied as this one. Would I call it a masterpiece? No, but there\u2019s a reason why it got such a good reception. It\u2019s well executed and stays within its limits. What I mean by this is that it doesn\u2019t try to develop into some convoluted plot that leaves the story withholes. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nIn a few sentences, Zankyou no Terror follows two terrorists known as Nine and Twelve who release videos to the public containing a riddle, which, if solved, reveals the location of the bomb they planted. Little does everyone know, these terrorists have an ulterior motive that ties their mysterious past to their actions. \\n\\n\r\nThe series is clean in its execution (aside from a few minor issues, which are discussed later), which is as plainly as I can put it. It\u2019s well paced and stays loyal to the main plotline without overdramatizing each character\u2019s past. Where many series struggle is by either over-analyzing each character\u2019s past to the point where it becomes filler or leaving characters in the dark. In my opinion, finding the proper balance is no easy feat and many shows fail in this respect, but Zankyou no Terror did a good job of staying poised by unraveling the protagonists\u2019 pasts steadily during each episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes are a little repetitive and caused the show to lose some of its luster. The terrorists post a video, the police try to decipher it, and then they go on a scavenger hunt for the bomb. However, I didn\u2019t find each subsequent episode more boring than the previous because of this. The tension remains stable until after episode 4 when the main antagonist comes into play and builds all the way to the finale. The last episode is definitely one to remember. It ties everything together nicely and leaves the viewer with something to remember. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the plot wasn\u2019t predictable even during the repetitive episodes. There were always minor twists that caught me off guard. The story was revealed without being too vague or too obvious and it had me gripping my seat with the anticipation of not knowing what would happen next. The story is definitely what viewers will commit to memory after watching. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe cast features a nice variety of characters, but none of them were particularly memorable. I feel that most viewers will remember this series for its plot rather than the characters. However, the show did a great job of creating a cast with personalities that weren\u2019t too overbearing or ridiculous. Each character plays an important role even if it is a subtle one. What I enjoyed most about the characters was their development as the story progressed. Each character had a specific goal or desire in mind that inspired their actions. By the end of the series, each character had matured to some degree, which was reflected by their actions. \\n\\n\r\n*Skip to \u201cArt\u201d if you don\u2019t want character summaries\\n\\n\r\nNine and Twelve are fun to watch. Nine is generally the brains behind each bombing and is incredibly insightful while Twelve is the comic relief and spontaneous character. Although opposite in personality, they fit together perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of intellectual combat between the characters. For the first half, Nine and Twelve primarily face against Shibazaki (secondary antagonist), a gifted investigator over-dedicated to his work and was recently demoted for a previous case. He\u2019s the only one who can decipher their riddles, at first. He plays a vital role in revealing the protagonist\u2019s true intentions behind their attacks. \\n\\n\r\nA sudden change of events occurs with the introduction of the main antagonist and old \u201cfriend\u201d of the protagonists, Five, an American FBI agent. I felt her role was somewhat wasted or, to put it more lightly, anticlimactic. I wouldn\u2019t call her presence overbearing, but her process of thinking is highly erratic and causes quite an interesting twist in the story because she does everything in her power to thwart Nine and Twelve\u2019s plans. Her personal motives (aside from her job) for pursuing the protagonists, specifically Nine, were still somewhat unclear to me by the end of the series. I can\u2019t say anymore without spoiling one of the most climactic parts of the series, but her role in the show could have definitely been better. Even so, she certainly made the show more exciting. \\n\\n\r\nLisa is another side character that is present through most of the show. She plays a \u201csubtle\u201d role and is, to say the least, pretty useless, often getting in the way of Nine and Twelve. However, I didn\u2019t feel that her presence was unnecessary or annoying. Her friendship with the two, mostly Twelve, provides some of the only genuinely happy moments in the series and, although secluded from society in different ways, find common ground because of their alienation. \\n\\n\r\nEven saying this, viewers just starting the show will probably dislike Five and Lisa, but I felt that they added to the show to make it more fulfilling. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThere were some impressive action scenes that were enjoyable to watch, but the animation was nothing outstanding or revolutionary. It\u2019s simply good and suits the characters and story. One thing I thoroughly enjoyed about how the show was animated was that the character\u2019s emotions were somewhat complimented by their environment. When the characters were faced with confusion or despair, the scene was often dark and secluded. Conversely, times of contemplation and happiness were complimented by brighter and livelier scenery. I felt this amplified the emotions of each character and made them more realistic. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe directors compiled a good list of songs. The OT \u201cTrigger\u201d sung by Yuuki Ozaki from Galileo Galilei captures the nature of the show. The OST consisted of a variety of genres that complimented each scene very well, but, overall, nothing to create a lasting impression. \\n\\n\r\n~~~\\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate, this show stands out because of its well executed plot that continues to build tension without faltering or revealing too much, all the way up to the heart-gripping conclusion. The show certainly had its flaws including a somewhat repetitive plot early on and a few underwhelming characters. However, the show says something about human nature and where true terrorism lies. I found it to be a thrilling watch with riddles, bombs, and a pair of ambiguous protagonists for added unpredictability. It\u2019s a pretty straight forward show with no confounding philosophical themes to confuse the viewer. It was one of my personal favorites of the year and I feel that most people will find it worth watching. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend this show for people who like Death Note or Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 because of the similar dark, serious nature in them. \\n\\n\r\nHope this helped!\\n",

            "content": "(This review does not focus on any segment and is more of a reasoning of why I gave ZnT a 5, I do list good points but I mainly point out the bad things, this is still a review and structures like one.)\r\nShinchiro Watanabe has made some goddamn memroble ass series', in the year of 2014, the first one which aired in Winter was Space Dandy, a fun and enjoyable show which got good response from audience, a second season came out in Summer, during summer, this show also was airing, and it got massive amounts of praise, but in reality, it didn't really needall of it, this didn't really feel like Watanabe's works. His other works feel free to do anything, for example, in Cowboy Bebop, the plot and characters were given to us in about 8 episodes and from there on, the story could do what it wants, it could focus on any topic. Here it just feels strict and forced, 11 episodes really isn't enough to spread the story here. Cause of this it makes characters feel less memroble and have less time to develop, now I'm not saying that 11 episodes is way too little for a show, there's amazing shows that are only 11 episodes such as The Tatami Galaxy. The developements needs more time and the plot needs more explaining and the explaining done in this show is rushed and needs to take its time.\\n\\n\r\nNow I sound like i'm saying way too many bad things about this show and sound like I'm just gonna shit all over this show. Well not really, some key points to this show is the music and animation, this is not the only good things about the show but I do want to get it out of the way. The music is general is goddamn beautiful, its OST is filled with vibrant and calm moods, its a OST I'd actually pay money for. The OP is creative and inutitive with its vibrant animation and great concept of its music. The ED is a sad tune to really make you feel sympathy for some of the characters and the one it focuses on. the voice acting is solid and performed well by the characters. I could go on a whole paragrah or two saying how beautiful the music is, but this is a review, not a music analyzation. The animation is well done, everything seems hyper-realistic, people actually drew all this shit! The character designs are drawn well and look realistic as animation forms. This leads to the next good couple of things about this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe realism of this show is a whole 'nother level compared to other anime's worlds, it makes slice of life look like a puppy. Yes you heard me, a thriller's world makes a slice of life's look childish. The world is what you'd expect in modern society, the show even shows you some civillians lives when something happens and their reactions, it really shows you this isn't some place where anything can happen out of nowhere. This just sucks you into the show, even the technology used by the main MCs fr\\n\r\nor bombing and hacking are actual things from the real world such as Apple products, Sony, even out of that. Now I'm only mentioning this to show its realism, not, 'the MCs use Apple, the MCs have shit taste, why aren't they using [insert non-apple thing here]? Take a note of that.\\n\\n\r\nThe only way I was able to watch this show was cause of this world alone, other than that, it seems, meh. There isn't really much else from that. The characters are intriguing at first but as you learn about them, by the last couple of episodes, the only entertainment is the tense scenes, music and beautiful scenery. The world is pretty much how it would act in panic mode which has been done before in anime. So really, the beautiful world just becomes something frail.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the only thing i haven't mentioned, the characters, the glue between Story and Enjoyment. We have Nine and Twelve, Both these are the MCs and are terrorists, the interesting thing about them is that they don't kill anyone when doing their attacks. By the end of this show, even when we know all about their pasts, we still don't know why they don't kill people during their bombings. Now their personalities (no pun intended) are average at best, Nine is smart, brutal and poker face all the time man while Twelve is happy, clumsy and smiling all the time man. Their bond is strong, they both act as if they're brother of sympathy and pain. Later on in about episode 4 or 5, Lisa joins in on 9 and 12. As much as I don't wanna say it, she's more of a plot-device than anything and is goddamn useless to the plot. We don't know shit about her past, she gets bullied for some reason and she runs away from here mom cause she's overprotective, why she runs away? What does her mother really do? Sure we see her call and text her daughter (Lisa) more than usual but we don't know much about her. She has a bond with 12 yet why we need this bond? We don't really know, probably added for fanservice and pointless shipping. What I'm saying in this long paragraph in summary is that these characters have their ups and downs but in reality they feel rushed and leave plotholes.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror has so much potential yet dosen't have enough episodes nor time to space it out. Its a good idea done poorly. I like the idea of the terrorism. I like how smart 9 and 12 are. I like how they plan out their bombs. I like how they trick the police. I love the fuck out of the world, music and animation. This show could have been something amazing, if it had 22 episodes and had more time to flesh out things, this show could be a deep message about terrorism. Do I reccomend this show? Well not really, but as time to waste, go ahead, its only 11 eps and can easily be finished in one sitting. ZnT is good ideas wasted.\\n",

            "content": "Zankyou no Terror, an anime that basis it's story on acts of terrorism caused by two very intelligent individuals, as well as some random girl that was taken as an accomplice.\r\nI first want to start this review off by stating the premise of Zankyou. We are first shown with these two teenagers infiltrating a nuclear facility. This is where we are introduced to the characters personalities. One being ecstatic and carefree, while the other one is calm and collected whilst accomplishing their mission. Through this we can see the establishment of this dichotomy of personality between the two protagonists. This difference usually ends up withinteresting dialogue as well as a good variety to the upcoming moods of the show. Not only that, but it also ends up leading to some problems between the two.\\n\\n\r\nNow that that has been said, I want to talk about the story, or the main plot of this anime. These two individuals, the main protagonists, are refugees from a government funded settlement. Without spoiling anything, I wish to say that throughout the anime, they start to slowly uncover the secrets of this settlement, which in fact leads to the main reason for the actions of the terrorists. Now the terrorists, named Nine and Twelve, commit a series of bombing attacks. The twist here is, before the terrorist attack occurs, these two put themselves out in social media (in this case a parody of youtube) behind a mask (literally and figuratively), to which they are called Sphinx 1 and 2. They then propose a riddle, solving the riddle will allow for information related to the coordinates of the bomb. As the show progresses, the riddle goes from the targeted audience of the main public, to the police. Publicity is something that they require, something that is essential to their overall plan, therefore messages directly towards the police would not suffice, rather they broadcast the video to the general public. The reason being that they chose the police, is because there is someone there that they require in order for the plan to follow through. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters bring forth an interesting variety of emotions. As mentioned previously, we have Nine, the calm and collected of the two, and Twelve, the carefree, ecstatic one. As I've also mentioned this dichotomy is important. Because of Twelves personality, we've come across another character (episode one) who becomes a burden to the two. Note that I said earlier than his personality would bring them trouble, and it sure did. The addition of Lisa was a pain for me, she hurt more than she helped them, but she was a key figure in character development within Twelve. \\n\\n\r\nTo wrap things up i want to say that I truly enjoyed watching this anime. they did a fantastic job with the art, the story was something that easily hooked me, and the sound, the OST really stuck out in those dire situations, rather than just some noise in the background. Overall I would give this a 9/10.\\n",

I now sit here 6 hours later having finished the anime trying to find words that do it justice.\r\nWe all have that one day in our lives that we lived, that felt real and will be remembered, it may not have been a big day such as a wedding but could have been as simple as a day off work or the perfect date. This is exactly what Zankyou no Terror feels like. It doesn't rely on one big shock factor to sealthe deal it paces everything perfectly, leaving you satisfied, not wanting more or less. every element did their part to bring this masterpiece together. While it may not contain a big twist or shock factor it feels like a show that has been shown love and affection by the animators.\\n\\n\r\nEach and every character feels like they are reaching out to the audience, the story feels real and the soundtrack reaches right into your heart. The message is constant throughout and changes as the narrative progresses, leaving you asking \"if you had the chance, could you do it?\".\\n\\n\r\nI was on the edge of my seat the whole time with this anime, it was as though I was a part of it and for once I'm not upset that a journey has come to an end. Rather I feel better having seen it and knowing I can do it justice through recommending it to others. \\n\\n\r\nI don't think there will be an anime that will immerse me as much as this one did.",

            "content": "Terrorism is a very touchy subject. Everyone has their own opinion about the concept as a whole and what should be done about it. Truthfully, terrorism is an awful thing that plagues the world today and is not something that should be taken lightly. But Zankyou no Terror (or Terror in Resonance as some know it) takes the idea behind terrorism and handles it, well, beautifully. The 'terrorists' in the show aren't out to destroy because they can or just because they feel like it, but instead they have a very deep purpose behind their acts of violence...or rather, nonviolence. While the two boys, 9and 12, do destroy property, they plan out their attacks so carefully that no one gets more than a little scrape during the commotion. They manage this by hacking into computers or setting off alarms or even getting the police involved in the case. They want to commit these crimes, but no one needs to get hurt.\\n\\n\r\nNow as for the show itself, it's rather standard. Terrorists make a plot, police try to bring them down, one side stands victorious at the end of the day, repeat. It would get very dull or standard if not for the characters. The characters are truly what make this show (well, them and the opening, \"Trigger\", which is a beautiful song). Characters range from being light-hearted and kind terrorists to a shy, reclusive girl who wants nothing more than to be bolder, and washed-up cop that is striving to take the terrorists down, no matter what the cost. The characters are truly the greatest aspect of this show and without them, it wouldn't be worth the watch.\\n\\n\r\nAs stated, terrorism is a very sensitive subject for many people and that may turn them away from the show. But here's the thing: this show handles such a horrid subject so well that it's almost perfectly done. The creators don't try to make light of the topic and many times even the terrorists know what they're doing is wrong, but it's all they can do in order to fulfill their wishes. There aren't plot holes left at the end of everything and the whole story is wrapped up nicely. In fact, this show may have one of the most emotional endings and it's so perfect for the show, but I won't say more in case I spoil anything. Bottom line is that you shouldn't miss this show.\\n\\n\r\nPositives:\\n\r\n+\"Trigger\" is a beautiful opening\\n\r\n+Characters and character development are near flawless and it really makes the show\\n\r\n+The topic of terrorism is handled perfectly\\n\r\n+You will experience quite a range of emotions from watching this show\\n\r\n+Ending is amazing and fits the show very well\\n\r\n+Animation is very solid the whole way through\\n\r\n+Soundtrack is beautiful and well composed\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\n-Only 12 episodes (though, I'm not sure this is such a bad thing in this case)\\n\r\n-Some characters behave very unrealistically. I'm sorry but when you're a terrorist, you can't afford those kinds of liabilities\\n\r\n-A few aspects of the main story aren't full explained or are not explained well\\n\\n\r\nAs I sit here, I can't think of many negative aspects for this show. Even the ones above are slightly half-assed. Yet, I know it wasn't flawless at all. Perhaps it just didn't sit well with me. But, overall, Zankyou no Terror is a beautiful show that handles a touchy issue very well and is one of the more unique anime experiences I have seen. \\n\r\nAnd that is why Zankyou no Terror AKA Terror in Resonance gets an 8/10",

            "content": "Zankyuu no Terror was undoubtedly one of the highly anticipated anime of the 2014 summer season. Besides other high profile anime like Akame Ga Kill, Aldnoah Zero, Tokyo Ghoul that honestly didn't meet my expectations, Zankyuu no Terror was next on line. From the same directors, Watanabe Shinichiro with Yokko Kanno, that produced Cowboy Bebop, Zankyuu no terror was yet another great anime\r\nStory 9/10\r\nThe story kicks off on a present day of Japan,Tokyo, Tokyo Metropolitan Government building becomes a victim of a terrorist attack led by only 2 genius teenage  student causing the power to shut down temporarily . From this point on,its like seeing Yagami Light and L from DeathNote working together again. The 2 boys refer themselves as Sphinx, Nine and Twelve. During the process of the first \"terrorist attack\" a young girl, Lisa Mishima, was unlucky to be inside the building and found Twelve planting a bomb. Twelve gave her a decision to die or saved by us but has to become an accomplice in the group. As bomb were exploding the building she decides to join them and later was saved by Twelve. After the big incident, they wasn't any fatalities. Fire alarms conveniently starts up and the police were able to safely guide the people inside without any trouble whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation 8.7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt was visually stunning on the get-go. The shading and coloring were made as realistic as possible.The attention detail on the whole city of Tokyo was superbly done as it brings modern like city area. \\n\\n\r\nThe whole animation was absolutely breathtaking. There wasn't any dropped quality on all of the episodes and i highly recommend to watch the show on HD. The animation of the character was fluid and manage to capture actual human movements as possible. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack  9.7/10\\n\\n\r\nAll the beautiful soundtrack, oh my gosh. The soundtrack was so great to the point i often lose track of the show as the soundtrack start playing EACH time. From the series title. Zankyuu No Terror, most audience would expect the soundtrack would be filled with mostly dark and action music genre. But it's not all that\\n\\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GZWhAdqHys\\n\\n\r\nListen to the whole video at least to the whole chorus part. \\n\r\n(Don't worry its SPOILER FREE)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe two main protagonist, Nine and Twelve, has complete opposite of  personality. \\n\\n\r\nNine, the calm and collected personality but also cold eyes as in not a friendly type. He does have a caring heart, being together with Twelve the entire time. His determination on having his plan succeed is shown as he is willing to take risk. Nine skills is shown to be more of a master hacking and planning their next attack. Able to hack the Police Department official list of criminals with ease and giving tricky riddles\\n\\n\r\nTwelve, the cheerful and happy personality. He has one of the most interesting personality as he is more than a just lovable person. Never judge a book by it's cover truly states what he is like deep down. He is shown to handle task other than Nine's task. Prefers to drive at high speed on a traffic and sets up bombs. He is also shown be sneaky as he is able to avoid the security camera vision on complicated angles.\\n\\n\r\nLisa Mishima, the female protagonist who has suffered both domestic and social problems in her life. As the story progress, she starts to form a bond between the two male protagonist that literally saved her problems and also her life. She's also shown to help on the \"terrorist attack\". This shows that she isn't the typical damsel in distress.\\n\\n\r\nShibazaki, the former detective that got his job back because of the terrorist attack. So far out of the whole police department, he is the only one that is able to understands and solve Nine's tricky riddles. This is also due to his past cases connecting to the terrorist attack.\\n\\n\r\nFive, the female genius tactician that focus entirely on defeating Nine. A rival of Nine since at a young age, Five comes back and plans to destroy Nine and Twelve plans. The rivalry between them, i enjoyed every minute of it. Always thinking ahead of their opponent is simply thrilling.\\n\\n\r\nOverall/ Enjoyment - 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you have not noticed yet, I enjoyed every minute of it and would say this i series is as close as masterpiece. It certainly gives the vibe from DeathNote, another masterpiece. The reason why is said is only close to masterpiece is, personally i would like to see a little bit more depth of Nine and Twelve background story. Like how did they end up on the whole project thingy when they were kids. Five should also be given much more in depth of her character, maybe explaining why was she so concerned on defeating Nine,maybe Five had a bad past issue on Nine or simply jealous. who knows \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, this series is truly amazing \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

At one point of time, you feel your heart cry out to the possibilities that could have existed.\r\nThe music adds on beautifully to the feel of the anime.

            "content": "This anime, this anime has be one of my favorites animes this season. The amount of realism is just amazing. Everything looks so real its very hard to describe. They have actually added real things from reality such as I phone 4, the actual YouTube page and just recently Yahoo website.\u00a0\r\nThe main two characters are nine and twelve, both are terrorist plotting against the police in able to achieve something or someone, but unfortunately we have not been confirmed why they are bombing these places because so far the anime has not been shown. The main female protagonist is Lisa, at the beginning it showsthat she is getting bullied shes not eating, her mother constantly messages her about her food and why she is not eating, so I can tell that she is not coping very well in her life, she believes that world should not exist because in her reality she agrees with herself that should just end, Nine is a very complicated character to describe and also not spoil, but he suffers from the past a lot by having dreams unlike Twelve, Twelve is a very interested character because he learns about the world and how people lives hes are very funny and energetic character, but he can be scary sometime, Nine hides himself quite well. Just by watching the first episode the episodes explains every characters one by just by the characters just saying one line of a sentence. There is not a lot of dialog within this anime, this why I think personally it fits well within the environment and the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe ost is just brill, the opening fits well and the ending, and the actual person behind the music is Kanno Yuoko.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime does remind me of Death Note but there is a huge difference between the two. Riddles that the police have to solve in able to stop these bombs.\\n\\n\r\nHope enjoy it................ :D\\n\\n\\n",

Two teenagers stole an atomic bomb & fooled batches of adult cops.\"\r\nBut then thanks to the scriptors that made it looks \"good\".\r\nCharacter.\r\nWas Good. Yet, you still got a crazy megalomania girl, super intelegent & naive boys. But, they really good at managing Shibazaki, Mamiya, & the rest of the supporting role.\r\nEnjoyment & Overall.\r\nIt's been a long time since i enjoyed an anime.

However, while the art is fantastic, the story seriously drops off at the half-way point with the introduction of a certain character. The premise that is revealed later in the show, along with Five, feels quite tacky and really undermined what I thought could have been a really interesting and cool show. Zankyou no Terror has the looks but not much of a personality.\r\nThe show has some decent characters, personally I liked Nine and the dynamic that 9 and 12 had with both the detective and schoolgirl. Overallthough, I felt like Zankyou could have been so much better if it went into a different direction plot-wise that supported its themes better. The things they want to say were left half-done it felt like. Certain other plot elements felt weak and underdeveloped as well(the \u2018game\u2019, for example). I \u2018get\u2019 it, but the manner in which they go about their mission seems pretty ineffective at actually accomplishing their goal\u2026something that turned me off of the series when I was finally done. All in all it felt very\u2026postmodern, if I had to use one word to describe it.",

            "content": "-This review is spoiler free-\r\nStory (10/10) \r\nYes, I know. You're going to start seething in fury. You're going to start rampaging throughout the streets because you think that I'm overrating this anime in every shape and form. Now, this is the part where I completely and utterly disagree with you. This is where I allow you to understand my outlook on this anime and share my opinions. \r\nYes, this story deals with terrorism. However, it is completely on a different scale. The depth of their reason allows our mind to go beyond the boundary. It is almost similar to Tokyo Ghoul. There are two sides,but each side has no \"good\" or \"evil.\" They follow their own path and choose what they seem is right. You could also say that the terrorists are the \"ghouls\" and the police are well... the police. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the way the clues follow through the story is completely outstanding. They even add hints of other interesting facts. They mentioned the story of \"Oedipus.\" A little twist of riddles that make you sit through and think. Completely mind-boggling. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nAhh, what can I say about the art? It's original and unique. The characters are so exquisitely drawn. It's like an eloquent brush of black ink that traces alongside the shades and corners of their skin. It's realistic but imaginative. It's marvelous. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nVery dramatic scenes when it comes down to the voice acting and sounds. The suspenseful music makes you question about the next outcome. That little mint in the corner? Yeah, that's a bomb in disguise. The voice acting is beautifully done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThey are distinct and have individuality. They have their past and secrets, and there's these questions that keep bubbling up inside of you whenever you look at their faces. Remarkable. Absolutely remarkable. Nine and Twelve are complete opposite, but are the complete same. They cannot live without each other. Their puzzles that are side by side, but are not allowed to entwine. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nAt first, it was steady. I kept stalling and multi-tasked throughout the first few moments of the episode. However, when I finally got right down to it - I never regretted the decision. It was a stunning experience. The way the whole idea was formed and created. The way they made the viewers actually VIEW the story - and to make it even better, you get to see both sides. I enjoyed it very much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime may not be for anyone. The ending did make me shed a bit of tears - but I knew it was coming (I kind of spoiled myself. Whoops.) If you have a weak heart, just keep reminding yourself that the story isn't real. However, I enjoyed every ounce of it. Lisa is such an adorable woman. Her heart is set at the right place, and she never fades into darkness. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, this anime is not a very \"fictional\" anime. Its originality and realistic aspects is the thing that drew me in, and made me hooked. Therefore; if you aren't that type that sits down and enjoy psychological situations, and prefer a much more idealistic tone, you may want to lay this one down. However, if you do try it, you won't be disappointed!\\n\\n",

If your looking forward to watching this do not i repeat DO NOT go into this show thinking its gonna be the next DEATH NOTE because it really doesnt deliver if you hold it up like that. So if you are wanting to watch this and enjoy it have no expectations and have no comparisons to death note and your experience might be better than mine was.\\n\\n",

What will keep me watching is the amazing animation and captivating plot.\r\nThe plot is so captivating simply because there\u2019s so little that\u2019s actually revealed in this first episode.  We know that Nine and Twelve are terrorists of some kind based on their actions... but we know little more than that. \r\nZankyou no Terror also has top-notch animation.  There were several times during the episode's that I had to remind myself that I wasn\u2019t watching a live-action show but rather something animated.  A lot of time and energy clearly wentinto animating the scenery, in particular. \\n\\n\r\nOn top of the amazing animation is the excellent soundtrack.  The opening song is what hooked me on the series, but the ending song and the soundtrack are just as good.  The soundtrack is very understated unless you\u2019re listening for it (which I often do), but it definitely highlights the action on screen.\\n\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror has the potential to be the best anime I've seen thus far, and it\u2019s definitely one too remember...",

            "content": "Where do I go from here? I literally found myself trying to think about what to do after finishing this show.\r\nIt's one where after you're done, you just have to sit there and consider what you just watched. Usually, I say, well, that was a good show, onto the next. In this case, I don't know if I should watch anything right now, because I don't think I'll be able to enjoy it as much. For a first time reviewer, I'm not going into depth about each aspect, more vague, so you can enjoy it yourself. It's a show that I'd recommend going into itwith the least you can know.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the STORY, I'd say it was something pretty interesting, it really did keep me interested, without gaps. There were times when I could not wait to find out about different aspects of the characters, or different pieces that I would put together. Put simply, the story was fun to follow along with, and intriguing, not often do you get a show about Terrorism that does it in such a bright way.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say that the ART stood out way too much, it was definitely something I enjoyed, but it wasn't anything as outstanding as the rest of the show. In no way does it hold it back though. The art style was done quite well in certain scenes to bring out more emotion, which was beautifully done.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the SOUND of the show. Yoko Kano's work here was amazing with pieces that could not have fit the scenes better in my opinion. I'm a simple man, with simple tastes, but not only were the intro, and ending songs spectacular, but in certain minimalistic parts of the show, where it's more focused on the emotions being brought out, the sound track only amplifies it... This is an OST I will most likely find myself listening to for a long while. This music is highly in my taste, so of course this could be more swayed towards my personal opinions, but in some parts of this show, I feel like the sound track stood out so highly.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great aspect I liked about the show was that the CHARACTERS were easy to follow in major aspects, but you still did have to do some piecing of the puzzle out. The majority of this, features 5 people who are very memorable in each of their aspects. There are some very obvious troupes that a certain character falls into, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but while in many aspects he feels like a cool or interesting character, you almost feel everything he is going to do coming. Either way, this is a strong point of the show as well, because each character's motives, and development are strongly etched into me after this show. \\n\\n\r\nMoving to ENJOYMENT, I'd say this was a show I can't wait to give a few months, so I can get myself to watch it again. I may have literally just finished watching it, but I can't wait to watch it again. I want to relive those moments where the OST makes me fall in love. There are always shows you wish you could forget and watch all over again, because you know you'll never be able to experience what you have, and for me, this is one of them. I'm hoping the show has good re-watch-ability (which is totally a word). \\n\\n\r\nFinally, I come to the end of my first review, calmed a bit, still trying to consider if I will be able to go back and watch more GTO... The impact this show left on me was enough to really leave an impact, and I may be a simple man with simple tastes, but I'm honestly glad I watched this show, and hope for more shows that can try and combine such a melancholic sound track, and beautiful story, with characters that are enjoyable.",

            "content": "Zankyou no Terror is not so much an anime about terrorism, so if you are looking for an anime completely centered and about terrorism, then I would not personally recommend this Anime. \r\nZankyou no Terror is about 2 people who were put in a test lab and lived out their childhood there. The 2 escaped and lived on together after that becoming very close, almost like brothers. Another character is soon after introduced called Lisa. Her mother became depressed and insane after her husband left her, and went crazy whenever Lisa left the house, because she feels as though she will walk out of herlife too, so she sends text messages constantly to her, and even at home harasses her, saying things like \"please don't leave me like your father\". Anyways, she runs away and stays with the two others.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the Anime we learn more and more about the childhoods of 9 and 12 (the 2 close friends lab names), and get closer to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe Anime has an outstanding story, some of the best art you will ever see in Anime and great characters that you will come to love. However, the voice acting for the Americans was quite poor and came across as stupid at times.\\n\\n\r\nOver all, this is my favorite Anime that I have seen to this day, and I have seen over 50. I highly recommend watching it.",

            "content": "Shinichiro Watanabe is considered by many as the best anime director of all time. With works such as Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Kids on The Slope, and Space Dandy, one might agree that he is. So when Zankyou no Terror was first announced, a lot was really happy and excited for it. Not a big fan of Watanabe myself, I was quiet when the whole thing was happening. At the back of my mind I thought it was going to be the same old episodic stuff again. But once the first episode was released\u2026 *boom*. So, a simple question to find out in this reviewwould be: Does it live to the hype or was it ruined by it? Hopefully, by the end, we can come up with the same answer.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\n\tI\u2019ll be honest, when I first heard about this show; I wasn\u2019t really that much excited about it. Having seen only two shows directed by Shinichiro Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop and Space Dandy), I thought I knew what to expect: \u201can episodic anime with new stand-alone stories every episode\u201d like Bebop and Dandy. Boy, how wrong I was. Though ZnT is a bit episodic (at least during the first episodes), it is not like Bebop and Dandy in storytelling. It doesn\u2019t really follow a weekly \u201cstand-alone\u201d episode formula but a rather interesting story with an overarching plot. It was rather surprising for me because it\u2019s a fresh new thing in which Watanabe\u2019s name was attached to. After the first episode, I was immediately hooked and I continued watching it from then on. Though I would never rank it higher than Bebop because I would get a lot of hate from the old fags (well, I\u2019m one of them), I would say that it is \u201cup there\u201d. For the first show that fully tackles the aspects of terrorism, it surely deserves praise. The closest shows I\u2019ve seen with terrorism aspect in it are Code Geass and Guilty Crown. And terrorism was just like a statement in both series. It was like \u201cthese groups are terrorists.\u201d And that\u2019s about it. \\n\\n\r\nThough the story may not be that fleshed out, I think it is one of the few recent anime that will stand against the test of time and 10 years from now, it will still be talked about just like how Bebop is still being talked about today 17 years after it first aired.\\n\\n\r\n Characters:\\n\\n\r\n\tThe characters are a bit hard for me to talk about. I don\u2019t really know how I feel about them. I like them but I know that they have a lot of problems. Though some of them might be likeable for the most part, they all share a ton of problems that one might just ask why. I refuse to talk about Nine and Twelve because they\u2019re fine (at least for me) so let\u2019s just talk about the 2 obvious ones.\\n\\n\r\n\tFirst is Mishima Lisa. Though Lisa is a dunce, I liked her character. Not because she was a well written character but because she was just fun to watch because of her role/curse. It\u2019s as if her role in the series is to be a disaster magnet. Throughout the series, she has been in dozens of close calls and unfortunate events. It\u2019s as if every day in her life is Friday the 13th (I\u2019m actually writing this on Friday the 13th. What a coincidence). Every time she goes out, something bad happens. Let\u2019s take a little peek at the life of Lisa Mishima, shall we? She was bullied at school, she became an accomplice for terrorists, her mom is so protective that it\u2019s so scary, she almost died every episode since Five showed up, and finally, the guy she kinda likes gets killed in front of her. Seriously, has she ever seen a happy day in her life? I feel so sorry for her\u2026 I seriously do. *muffled laughter*\\n\\n\r\n\tThen we have Near\u2026 Oh, sorry. Wrong series. I meant Five. The one who holds all the \u201cwhy\u201d in the series. Why is she so obsessed with Nine? Why did she team up with the ones who tormented her? Why does she look like a gender-bended Near? Why is she such a fucking bitch? Why is she such an extremist? And most importantly, why did she kill herself when she finally cornered Nine (it\u2019s almost too funny that after she killed herself the first thing we see was Shibazaki saying \u201cwhy\u201d)? \\n\\n\r\nFive: I finally cornered you! I\u2019ve won! I can kill you but that\u2019s not what I should do. I should just kill myself just because lol I want to! *bang*\\n\\n\r\n\tWWWWWWWWWWWWHHHHHHHHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYYY????????!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\n\tThe animation for the series was handled by a fairly new animation company in MAPPA. Though it was the first big-name anime that they put out, it really looked fucking amazing. It really makes me wonder where they pulled the budget to make the amazing things that they did in the series. From the banging explosions to the quiet, tranquil moments, I think it is safe to say that for their first project, MAPPA surely delivered. If I can give out an award for 2014, I\u2019d probably give the \u201cBest New Studio\u201d award to MAPPA rather than to the other new \u201cbig-name\u201d studios like TROYCA and Trigger. If I could produce a new series, I\u2019d gladly give it to MAPPA. Just please don\u2019t involve CG. CG made by MAPPA is just utter shait (Bahamut & Garo).\\n\\n\\n\r\nSounds:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for this series is just heavenly. For a series that is covered by banging explosions throughout, it sure stood out during its quietest moments. Tranquil music plagues (in a good way) the entire series and it was just beautiful. By far, it is the only soundtrack that I have listened from cover to cover. I always tend to skip something when listening to OSTs but this one was different. I listened to every track there is and I was seriously asking for more when it ended. It was that good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIts tranquility mixed with some variations of rock (lolol. It\u2019s not \u201clol lol\u201d it is seriously the title of the music) and techno (veat) is just too good for the ears. These are the type of music that is perfect after a long day at school or at work. When you feel down, just put on your earphones, press play, sit back, relax, and just soak everything in\u2026 it will just cure your heart, take away your fatigue, and make you feel good. \\n\\n\r\n Amazing music like \u201cvon\u201d (Used in the Ferris wheel scene. And is by far my favorite) and \u201cis\u201d (This one was used during the motorcycle scene) were really used well in the series. Though mostly used once, hearing it one time is enough for me to buy the soundtrack. It was so good that I bought it in order to give this section decent information because listening with just the couple of clips in the series might not give it the justice it deserves. If for some weird reason you don\u2019t even consider watching the series, just listen to the music. Composed by the one and only Yoko Kanno, your money will surely be not wasted. Just don\u2019t make the same mistake I did of playing it while driving after work. Fatigue, stress, plus relaxing music. Makes you wanna sleep, doesn\u2019t it?\\n\\n\r\n\tSince I can\u2019t really understand Japanese, I really don\u2019t have that much to say about the dub. Though with an obvious dub by Funimation shortly incoming, it\u2019s probably safe to not point you in watching it in Japanese first if you\u2019re a dub lover, right? I mean come on! It\u2019s a Funimation dub. I rarely see dubs they put out that are below average. Hmmm\u2026 I really wonder if Funimation will pay me for advertising them. lol. But if you are a solid sub fan, then you surely won\u2019t be disappointed. Though I can\u2019t understand what they were saying, I can certainly feel the emotions that the seiyuus wanted to portray. And with that, I say well done.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\\n\r\n\tShinichiro Watanabe along with Yoko Kanno delivers once again. After watching the season 1 of Space Dandy, I felt that these two have lost their magical touch. I will now go down on my knees (and *toot* *toot*) and ask for forgiveness. You two are still the golden combi of the anime industry. I\u2019m sorry if I ever doubted you because of Space Dandy. If you ever decide to make another series, be sure to make it like this one. Though episodic shows aren\u2019t bad, I still prefer a story where characters can grow much better and a plot that I can fully get attached to. That\u2019s all I want. It probably isn\u2019t that much to ask right? *sparkling puppy eyes*\\n\\n\r\n\tAnd with all that said, and after computing some imaginary numbers, I\u2019d gladly give Zankyou no Terror an overall score of 8.73 out of 10. Though not in the masterpiece level, it\u2019s still a very good show with an okay story, fun characters, amazing animation, and heavenly soundtrack. Even if both the story and characters are really not that good, one can still look past that because of the unique premise it presents. Since it\u2019s the only anime that fully tackled the concept of terrorism, it\u2019s hard to find a good comparison to say that it is bad. \\n\\n\r\nAs 2014 was a pretty good year of anime, I\u2019d be proud to say that I consider ZnT as both Anime of The Season (Summer) as well as Anime of The Year. With all the amazing shows that come out last year, it was rather easy picking an obvious winner. Many may not agree with me but I personally believe that it deserves what I gave it. Though not that well received by others, I can vouch that this show deserves all the hype it got\u2026 unlike a certain show about \u201ckilling\u201d which was just decimated by the fanbase in its ass. A bit disappointing towards the end but it\u2019s passable. It\u2019s like I always say: \u201cIt\u2019s not about the destination. It\u2019s about the journey.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAlternate Anime Recommendation:\\n\\n\r\n\tFor alternate anime recommendation why don\u2019t you try Death Note. Both series revolves around a cat-and-mouse stereotype between the protagonists and antagonist\u2026 though it is really hard to determine which is which because both the series\u2019 protagonist are anti-heroes so you\u2019ll either cheer them or hate them. I personally don\u2019t think this is a good recommendation since I believe that 95% of users here on MAL have already seen Death Note\u2026 more than once. But if you\u2019re the other 5% then you will surely thank me for it.\\n\\n\r\n\tIf you\u2019ve already seen Death Note then there\u2019s still Cowboy Bebop. Also made by the one and only Shinichiro Watanabe, you sure as hell know what to expect before even watching the show. Almost made by the same team, you can see some similarities between the two.\\n\\n\r\n\tI\u2019m sorry if I can\u2019t put out a decent recommendation this time since I can\u2019t see much more suitable anime in my list that fits in ZnT\u2019s premise. For a show about terrorism, it sure is hard to find a good recommendation since there\u2019s only few of them. I can always point you to shows I haven\u2019t seen yet but I can\u2019t vouch for its authenticity. As a bonus, here are 2 more. Guilty Crown (a review might come out before the end of the week. I\u2019ve finished 50% of it) and Code Geass. Though both show didn\u2019t focus that much about terrorism like ZnT did, both these show have terrorism aspects to them. A bit similar since almost all of the protagonist are anti-heroes too.\\n\\n\r\n\tAnd that\u2019s it for me. Thanks as always for reading. I might pull out a couple of reviews this week since spring break is coming and I\u2019ll be busy working so look forward to it. Thanks as always and buh-bye!\\n",

The series isn't one of the best out there that has a crime-terrorism-\"anti-hero\"-thriller aspect, but this is definitely something you can check out. I just stumbled upon this anime and had no idea what this is show is about, but I should say that both of the tags indicated in MAL are most accurate. It's a thriller/psychological anime alright.\r\nHonestly speaking though, I feel that Zankyou no Terror has plot-holes all over the place. However, I found the whole experience--the gistof the story, the pacing of scenes, and other aspects--to be quite enjoyable. Characters aren't very unique, but some of them are somewhat likable. The artworks were nicely done, and the sound effects used were also appropriate. I also appreciate the sound tracks (BGM) in this series; they either symbolized something or amplified the current situation.\\n\\n\r\nEither way, if you decide to not watch this anime, I wouldn't say that you'll be missing out on anything great. Still, in my opinion, it's a good anime overall.",

(stupid, clumsy, TOTALLY useless, being kidnapped by bad guys and waiting for heroes to save her, burden for the main characters!,...) I mean why?! why would the writers bring her to this show? she was literally useless\\n\\n\r\nFive! I mean what the fuck xD\\n\r\nwhat was that ending?!!! why would she commit suicide for 9?! SOOOO STUPID, such a shame she was kinda interesting as a character, i thought it would go somewhere but I guess the fuck not!\\n\\n\r\ntwelve\\n\r\nI don't think this idiot had any real reason for being a terrorist and his love with Lisa was so cheap and forced, it was the typical \"love at first sight now I'm gonna sacrifice my life for you even though I don't know your last name yet!\"\\n\\n\r\nNine\\n\r\nwell he was interesting but he didn't develop at all, you know he got wasted in this show, and his face sometimes is full of details and the next shot it's not! (lazyass animators)\\n\\n\r\nif the MCs were sadistic the plot would turn out just fine and more rational but writers intended to make them more human but then MCs didn't have any purpose to keep going\\n\\n\r\nand they simply stole from Monster (eugenics experiment gone wrong!, namelessness)\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nConclusions:\\n\r\ndo you like riddles? do you have plenty of time? have you watched other good anime? are you stupid?\\n\r\nif you answered all with Yes then it's time to watch this anime!",

Even the ending was just right, you'll see if you watch it.\r\nThis anime went to my top 5 as soon as I watched it and it has stayed there since, I can't even really say that there are anime that are currently beating it butthat might be because I watched it not too long ago so it is still shining bright.

            "content": "\u201cZankyou no Terror\u201d is one of the most remarkable animes of this season. It was directed by Sinichirou Watanabe, who is known for animes such as Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo or Sakamichi no Apollon.\r\n.:: Story ::. \r\nThe theme of two young terrorists in Tokyo isn't exactly a well-explored one. The premise of the series was entirely new to me and really fascinating. The first few episodes are really excellent and although the anime isn't quite able to keep up that quality throughout the course of the series it never becomes boring or dull. Although I'm not too fond of the ending, since I'm under theimpression that the only purpose the ending serves is to evoke an emotional reaction from the audience without serving any greater purpose, I still think that the series becomes better towards the ending again.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\n.:: Character ::. \\n\r\nBoth Nine and Twelve have intriguing personalities that complement each other very well. Personally, I believe that their relationship is by far the most interesting one. Finding out about their past and being curious about their future was the main factor why I kept watching. \\n\r\nDetective Kenjirou Shibazaki, who started off as the antagonist of the series, plays an important role and is the essential component that keeps the story going. Unfortunately, I didn't find all characters to be fleshed out that well. While Lisa's storyline is not hindering the development of the story, I find her to be rather bland and boring. Moreover, I believe that she could be substituted for any other generic looking high school girl and it wouldn't make much of a difference.\\n\r\n[Spoiler]\\n\r\nOne of the few problems I have with the series was Five. After her introduction midway through the series the story goes downhill and seemes to be going in circles for a while. Five was supposed to be an opponent worth of Nine and Twelve, both brilliant boys, but turned out to be overly powerful. Although I was interested in her past, only few of the man questions I had were (vaguely) answered at the end. I find it incredibly hard to take a liking to her and I was even relieved when she died, because I hoped the series would be able to pick up where it left before the introduction of Five. \\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\n.:: Art::. \\n\r\nThe anime was produced by MAPPA, which is a relatively new animation studio, but there's no doubt that it has the potential to become one of the big powerhouses for animation in the future. The animation was well-executed and smooth. The animation style was clean-cut without being bland, simple but not ugly, realistic and yet dramatic. I personally would have liked it to be a bit more detailed, but the animation never failed to impress and entertain me nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\n.:: Sound ::. \\n\r\nThe series' music is composed by Yoko Kanno, who has previously composed music for Cowboy Bebop, Ghost in the Shell, Porco Rosso and various other well-known animated series and movies. The soundtrack, and especially the opening theme song \u201cTrigger\u201d, was without doubt one of my personal highlights. The songs are wonderfully tailored to the anime's plot and really refreshing in a way. I bought the soundtrack to \u201cZankyou no Terror\u201d, which I rarely do, and still enjoy listening to it.  \\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\n.:: Enjoyment ::. \\n\r\nI watched the entire anime in one day, so even though it's short I think it's fair to say that the anime is quite enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\n.:: Overall ::. \\n\r\nThe anime was overall very compelling, entertaining and surprisingly mature. Although there were some minor weak points they were overshadowed by the fascinating premise, the beautiful execution and most of all the beautiful music. All in all, I could recommend this series and see it as one of the best new animes of 2014. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 \\n",

            "content": "**SPOILERS**\r\nThis isn't your typical protagonist who is going to save the world and defeat villains with plot-armor and character development. \r\nThis is a blunt, creative, absolutely tragic and beautiful critique of how the US is the world's #1 asshole (I jest - but not really ;__;)\r\n****\r\nLet's be brief. \r\nArt was stunning. Absolutely gorgeous - it's been a while since I've seen anything animated as beautifully and the fluidity of the characters' movements was very nostalgic. \r\nStory had its flaws, but it was incredible. It was dark and straightforward. \r\n\"Music from a cold land\" - Sigur Ros anyone? Enhanced the show. \r\nCharacters - I have somemisgivings on Five and Lisa mostly, but I'll get to that later. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I finished it in one sitting so major love. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10. \\n\\n\\n\r\n****\\n\\n\r\nThoughts:\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe emotions were so cold, and the story was very bleak and being such a short series (only 11 episodes) there were instances when some plots were wrapped up loosely and I never got the closure that I wanted. However, this makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is an earnest attempt at being realistic. There are events in our lives where we will never obtain that closure that we want and desperately need. Life is guessing game and we're always in the dark. Especially regarding questions dealing with society as a whole. Politics, social constructs - so many complexities that would take more than a lifetime to unravel. Various connections and an infinite possibility of outcomes. The lack of closure reflects our uncertainties, and the regret and misgivings attached to that is something that we've learned to cope with. Life goes on. \\n\\n\r\nI personally felt like the writing was a reflection on how society has recovered from WWII. The victims from Japanese war crimes (Unit 731) was touched with the Athena project. The atom bomb was a nod to Hiroshima. US government interventions and their approach at foreign policy was accurately portrayed (US just f**ks everyone over for our benefit). \\n\\n\r\nAlso a nod at the rebellious spirit of youth and the changing generations. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say about Nine and Twelve (love them dearly) besides what drove their actions was that they want people to remember that they lived. Viewers can decide for themselves. I feel like I should address the characters that were hated. \\n\\n\r\nI loved Lisa. I understand the hate she gets because I was personally frustrated with her the majority of the story as well and how she seemed to have little to no character development. \\n\\n\r\nThis makes sense to me in a twisted way. I view Lisa as someone I can relate to. An average girl, dealing with bullies and an emotionally unstable mother. Not to mention I'm a teenager which is already hard enough. Now I'm forced to be an accomplice with terrorists who blew up the government building and are actually geniuses because of human experimentations. Seeing how this show tries to be realistic, how many people mature and grow in such a short time span in a ridiculous setting such as that? Try as I want, I know I couldn't bring myself to blow up an entire airport or follow a plan that I'm not fully knowledgeable of when I couldn't even stand up to the girls bullying me. She's an anchor in the show, something that was constant in a whirlwind of political secrecy and explosions and someone I could relate to - and this show needed that, especially after they introduced Five. \\n\\n\r\nFive was vital. So vital. She was introduced as an antagonist, and I hated her. I hated how dramatic she was; how ruthless she was towards Nine, Twelve, and her perfect English speaking partner. However, when her arc neared the end I realized that I couldn't bring myself to hate her and I have to admit I cried a bit. \\n\\n\r\nShe was necessary show the results of how the experiments affected the children. She had the capabilities of a genius, but in return she was socially impaired. She never fully understood her actions, and everything was a game that continued all those years prior between her and Nine. The competition between those two was her only enjoyment. She was the only one who survived, and the first one shown to die. From that moment on, you knew that the experimented children had a limited time frame. It's what Five, Nine, and Twelve all hinted at. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also explains Savant syndrome where you excel in a certain area, but you also are affected in others. Due to her isolation she ended up like this and this is what the show wanted you to think. Also, when she dies, she chose not to kill Nine, and ended up dying herself which ruins her image as the ruthless villain. She was just a victim. Just like Nine and Twelve, she was used by not only the Japanese government, but the US as well. \\n\\n\r\nWhich leads to the ending of the Japanese government being exposed and everyone deciding that the US was a major prick because of what they did to Twelve. \\n\\n\r\n****\\n\\n\r\nEnding thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nI feel like Twelve had the potential of living a long life. He was the one who knew happiness because of Lisa, the one who knew the feeling of betrayal, love, doubt, and fear that was not directed towards him, but someone else. He knew humanity. Twelve and Nine were so similar, so I feel like Twelve saw himself in Nine since they both suffered together. However, throughout the show you never saw Twelve suffer from the side effects of experimentation which makes me wonder if it weren't for 'Merica.....\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I feel like this show could have been more and could have done more if there were more episodes. A part of me regrets that I couldn't know more. \\n\\n\r\nWhy didn't they talk more about Twelve and Nine's past? Why didn't they show the reactions to their deaths immediately after or the process? \\n\\n\r\nBut that makes sense. \\n\\n\r\nWe unraveled their past along with the detective. Just like reality, we can only know about the bits and pieces. We can never fully realize the extent of their fears and desperation. We won't understand their entire past. We can't see the entire process of something happening. There will never be closure. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there was closure with Twelve and Nine and just that little slice of peace is enough to make me content.\\n\\n\r\nSee You, Sphinx. \\n",

The feeling you get when finally understanding the true motives behind the character(s) makes you want to.. no words.. It's simply just an amazing feeling and you will have a ton of emotions running though your body.\\n\\n\r\nThe graphics and art displayed during the anime was amazing, really nicely done. It had some weak cgi which was barely noticeable, but it was all great! I don't even think that the cgi had a negative effect here since it was so amazingly well made.\\n\r\n~\\n",

            "content": "Okay lets start this. After finishing Zankyou no Terror or Terror in Resonance I spent half an hour thinking. \r\nSome people complained about not so much character development, but I consider that nondevelopment necessary. People who watch Psychological anime should understand that the development which is given is subtle and make you think good. It leaves you to think and find alone the meaning behind everything, not giving you the details, so you shouldn't wait for the ravens to feed you. Zankyou no Terror does exactly that. Gives the start the end and details, everything else is up to whoever watches the anime. Because Terrorin Resonance is pretty damn complex.\\n\r\nStory 9/10 \\n\r\nThe plot was great, you don't see often an anime about terrorists. I might say and it was an excelently put together kind of story. Sometimes it looked like it lacked in an episode and a half... but it got back up at full force. So I don't have any specific complaints about the story.\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nOm my god... the art... it was so accurate and beautiful, it was the perfect picture for this anime . It matched the plot and the characters up to the tiniest detail. So I would call this one of my favorite art style that I've seen.\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nIt was kind the first time I actually kept such a strict measure of the soundtracks. They really were chosen and made specifically for this. The soundtracks and art together alone could get you from feelings of sadness, joy, to melancholy and calmness. They were really abstract and stuck me good. I never actually listened to these kind of perfect match OSTs.\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nFine, they kind of lacked a little of OBVIOUS development. But if you watched week by week all the episodes 3 or 4 times each like I did, you would understand that I can understand their mentality and their way of thinking. The characters are intriguing, mysterious and kind of strange. But they were a breath of fresh air for me. I didn't stumble on anime with these kind of characters in quite a while and they are really interesting characters to watch and try to understand.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nWell, here isn't much to say. Only that it was FANTASTIC. From the first episode you get a rush of excitement that flows through your veins. The first episode was really mad, and from there on, the things get more complicated and hard to understand. But it still was a thrilling unique kind of enjoyment. I think everyone should experience this kind of thrill. It's really different from the one you get while watching Kuroko no Basket or Haikyuu!! or even Death Note. Even if this isn't your type of anime you should at last watch an episode for personal reference and experience.\\n\r\nOverall 10\\n\r\nI give it a ten because they way the story was told, the way the psychological part merged with the rest of the story and with the characters. I think I don't have anything more to say. Only one more thing, when watching this anime pay close attention to details, they say more than you would imagine.",

            "content": "From the director of Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo comes a new story from Watanabe, Shinichiro, \"Terror in Resonance\".  Admittedly I was quite skeptical as to how this show would turn out. From the beginning a lot of questions are raised and a build up from the first episode commences. The story for the most part isn't very original, it has a strange background but nothing unique. If you've seen a lot of shows or anime in general you will understand what I mean by that. It does try to create new ideas into a common theme but it's really nothing fresh. I seenthat somebody compared this to \"Eden of The East\" which would probably be the best comparison. Definitely more emotion than Eden but very similar in many aspects. The pacing is what somewhat disappointed me. A lot more of this story could have been flushed out in the 11 episodes of  Terror in Resonance. The artwork in this show features dark colors and a simple character design. It wasn't visually stunning but I enjoyed it because it fit the tone of the story. The music of Terror was fantastic. Had it not been for this soundtrack composed by Yoko Kanno a lot of emotion would have been lost. The OP and ED are so good that you won't even want to skip them. This show could not have been as good as it was without it. Believe me when I say that the first couple of episodes are not the best but what unfolds is a mystery that  leaves you wanting more. Terror in Resonance may not be the best anime of the season but it certainly is worth the watch. I give it an 8/10",

            "content": "Story: This show's greatest strength is how it unravels the truth behind Nine and Twelve's intentions. We begin with a setting in modern day Tokyo where 2 boys make off with what we know to be a heavily guarded and secured object. You can tell that moments up until revealing the protagonists' mission were paced very well up until the very end. The story writers did a damn good job of setting up each of the events, and making sure that we as the audience knew enough to know what was going on, but not give us the entire explanation just yet. 9/10\r\nArt: It seemsthat ZnT was going for a more realistic approach to its animation, which I found to add more to the story. The colors used and the graphic style paired well with the kind of mood that (I believe) the anime is going for, which is on more of a serious and darker tone. I understand that a psychological thriller probably wouldn't focus a lot on aesthetically pleasing aspects such as the hair color or backgrounds like most animations do. What I enjoyed was their use of feathers to off balance a lot of the psychological aspects of the anime. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: I really like the opening theme and found that it greatly captures the feel of the animation. The lyrics of the song also sets up the mood of the anime quite well. I also really enjoyed the voice acting in the main characters and felt like they were chosen very appropriately. I also look forward to more of Saito Soma's work in a future  with him voicing Twelve and Tatsumi from AgK, who have very different personalities and characteristics, very we'll. I retract a point due to the \"Engrish\" that was spoken throughout the show. I thought that the sloppiness of it took away from the sense of hostility and excitement that the producers want us to feel during intense scenes. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I consider the unveiling of Nine and Twelve's past to part of their character development because it allows us to understand why they have done the things they've done and chose the choices they've made. I also enjoy that Nine and Twelve have made an enemy of themselves in order to unveil who the true enemies are. Talk about a double negative creating a positive. The inclusion of Risa in their affairs didn't particularly draw out to her development, but more so to our protagonists instead. I would have liked to see her character play a stronger role, where she was not in need to always being saved or taken rare of by Twelve. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I very much enjoyed it. The beginning, where clues and riddles were being laid out was a great way to entice the us viewers to keep watching and anticipating for me. The tragic moments highlight how well thought out the plot was, and the final scenes made me feel sad, but at peace at the same time. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Great psychological thriller! I enjoyed how much research and realism that was put into this anime. I think it's pretty daring to put out an anime about terrorism considering all the current events happening lately, damn, Zankyou no Terror carried the task very well. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for something interesting to watch that shoujo and slice of life can't give to their viewers. 8/10",

            "content": "Hey, first review here! Please feel free to give me feedback!\r\nZankyou no Terror is one of my top favorite anime of this summer season, and even if just for the experience, it should be watched.\r\n--Story (8):\r\nThe plotline is refreshingly different from many other anime of the same genre. The concept of terrorism is not necessarily anything new, and the actions taken by our main characters seem to remind most people of Death Note. \r\nThis isn't going to become some kind of comparison essay of ZnT to other anime, but it certainly feels very different in relation to other shows. Even if you can predict theevents that occur throughout, the execution of such events is clever and leaves you satisfied. There was definitely room for more backstory, which is where I had to refrain from giving this section a full 10. Overall, though, the story is great to follow.\\n\\n\r\n--Art (10):\\n\r\nLoved it. The art is very clean and detailed, with cooler tones that give ZnT a feel unique to itself. The explosions from bombs are wonderfully animated, too.\\n\\n\r\n--Sound (9):\\n\r\nZnT has some of the most unique yet beautiful soundtrack music of any show I have ever watched. Mostly the music very poignant and fit the emotion of the scene extremely well.\\n\\n\r\n--Character (7):\\n\r\nIf there were one thing that I would say the anime fell short of doing, it was character development. I didn't find many problems in most of the characters that stayed generally the same, and it was also easy to get attached to almost all of the cast, but at times I still feel a little disappointed in how static they are.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what development existed was usually both forced and rushed, and often I would be confused: I found that there was almost no reason for some of the changes that occurred to certain people. Given that the show is only 11 episodes, I can understand why the writers could not find the time to fit in very crucial development; but they DID change specific characters in ways that almost estranged me. Although not huge, I did feel this was the most prominent flaw in the anime.\\n\\n\r\n--Overall (9):\\n\r\nOverall a very nicely-made anime. Often it could easily manipulate my emotions and bring me to tears, anger, or the occasional laughter. It was a pleasure to watch it over the course of several weeks and I hope many others find it as wonderful as I do!",

            "content": "Zankyou no Terror was an anime  that I had my eye on before it was airing, the plot seemed interesting and the animation looked different. In fact, I admit it - I was a bit hyped up for it. Perhaps those high expectations lead me to disappointment, lead me to feel this emptiness (and not the good kind either.)\r\nZankyou no Terror establishes it's plot earlier on but it's actual execution was (annoyingly) flawed. The audience watches two boys, who calls themselves only by numbers - Twelve and Nine. \r\nWe are represented with no information on them. To us, these are just two good lookingguys with high intellect appearing as terrorists to the public, to the police and to the government. They call themselves the \"Sphinx\" and make a number of violent acts that appear to have the intent to harm. To kill. But as you may guess, things are rarely what they seem. And what is portrayed in the exterior may not completely stand for who those people are.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that the audience is given such little material and substance, we are left grasping on tiny hints they show. There is a shadow of mystery and fog between us, the audience and the characters. Which certainly adds a different kind of thrill, you try your best to somehow humanize these characters. To attach ourselves and make ourselves sympathise. (Which takes a lot of patience - seriously.)\\n\r\nBut we are only given glimpses. Only reflections they want us to see and I think it is up to you to how you wish to react to it. But certainly, for a good portion of this 11 episode show - we are kept in the dark.\\n\\n\r\nBeing in the dark, kept away from the truth and hidden secrets is a prevalent theme throughout the show, everything is complex, everything is tied and twisted into another. Nothing is ever clear, even to the end. Which, in one aspect makes the anime tackle such difficult issues of mistrust and lies in such a refreshing and brilliant route. But this show isn't only about that. Which is why things get blurry and it deliberately pushes us away that we have to make more of an effort to make sense of it all, to connect the dots and to somehow grab all the little pieces to make a full puzzle.\\n\r\nWhich, actually, is what the police try to do when they cross paths with these boys who send different messages and mysteries which they try to solve. Try to understand. But underneath these \"terrorists\" who look like they have way too much time on their hands, there is a tone of plead. Almost as if they are trying to say something, trying to get away from the darkness.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while it may seem Nine and Twelve have this whole game planned in the palm of their hands, someone who also goes by only a number, Five, - screws the whole score board and so begins the game of cat and mouse. \\n\r\nBoth opponents playing a series of witty moves to trip the other one over. It's push and pull. The prey playing with it's food before it goes in for complete destruction.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, you'd think a formidable opponent for these two boys would allow the story to step forward and not on a downward spiral.\\n\r\nOf course, every episode has uncertain feeling of doubt. Of tension. It's suspense to the max. \\n\r\nBut personally, the middle of the show lost its spark and way. Like it got lost and tumbled over.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, hope is not all lost as - slowly but surely, things start to connect and though the veil is not always lifted full way. We get answers and we get motives - a twisted and saddening story of children who are treated as objects before human beings. As numbers before their name.\\n\r\nBut the question... that I think is pretty subjective - is it enough? In my opinion, since the anime did such a good job in isolating the characters both literally and figuratively that it forgot to let us in. To let us feel with them. I loved the characters, but I felt like I could not attach myself to them and like there was no sense of emotional investment. And if anything, was the most disappointing factor of the show.\\n\r\nI'm going to keep an open statement on Lisa's questionable use as it's going to be an ongoing debate for, ever.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I found that in the end, the show relied on telling us it's plot. Lecturing us. No one like's to be spoken at - they like to be spoken to. To be shown things. People want to see actions, not to be told words. Words mean nothing if they do not hold depth by characters we care about.\\n\\n\r\nFor a show I found very promising and different, it was undeveloped and sadly, anti-climatic IF you weigh against it's wasted potential.\\n\\n\r\nIf judged by its own on a stand point of view, you realise that it is an anime jampacked of fantastic components of a \"good\" anime. Diverse and colorful characters, unique plot. It's an enjoyable and timeless thriller that you certainly won't regret watching. \\n\r\nAnd not to mention, probably one of the best animation and OST in a long time.",

            "content": "Zankyou no Terror is tragic. You can TELL what they were trying to do, it just\u2026 didn't work. I think it failed the same way Death Note did: it kept trying to 1-up itself until it went to far. In fact, it has a lot it common with Death Note - from the genre, to the overall story (government vs. criminal), to the fact that we're rooting for the for the ones doing the most harm.\r\n   Five was somewhat pointless. It got to the point where it felt like she was only there to be filler, which is bad for a 12episode anime.\\n\\n\r\n   I even have issues with Lisa. They kept saying she served no purpose - she even admitted it herself - but she never truly finds one. It would have been much better if she had admitted it, then found a purpose within the trio. But she never truly finds one.\\n\\n\r\n   Zankyou no Terror had a lot of potential. But there are so many flaws that it falls on it\u2019s face. Which is tragic, because the first few episodes are astounding and the soundtrack is flawless. \\n\\n\r\n    I would recommend skipping this anime and watching Death Note instead. It did what Zankyou no Terror was trying to do - give you a suspense-filled psychotic thriller that leaves you guessing at every turn.\\n",

            "content": "After hearing lots of great comments of the anime, Zankyou no Terror, I finally had the chance to watch it. However, I was disappointed and realised how much of an overrated show this was. \r\nYou may or may not disagree with this review. \r\nStory: 5/10\r\nZankyou no Terror has a good premise, the first few episodes got me hooked. However, there are many illogical instances. \r\nHow does a bomb that explodes an entire building cause few casualties? How do people not get suspicious of the two students that stopped attending school after their first day? \r\nAlthough this is an anime, I think that it should stillbe logical. The way that the explosions were made were obviously for that 'boom' effect. The investigation were too easy. How the heck does Shibazaki know Greek mythology at the back of his hand? Maybe, if they had played it out and the police took a few wrong turns here and there, the show would have been more interesting. \\n\\n\r\nThe show disappointed me even further, with the introduction of Five, the primary antagonist of the show, which I will write about in the 'Character' section. \\n\\n\r\nI'm glad that in this anime, the policemen are not brainless idiots, compared to Sphinx. Well, there was at least one smart guy. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nColours and tone were appropriate for all scenes of Zankyou no Terror. I like how the rather dark colours reflect the grimness and sense of isolation in the show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack fits the anime. Intense and fast-paced soundtracks increased the tension and this builds up very nicely to the scenes. The slower paced tunes were powerful and had left a great impact on me. Again, possibly the most redeeming factor in the show. Voice acting was on point. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. This was the main reason why I had given the show a poor score. The characters of the show are rather one-dimensional and their goals are not fleshed out in the show. \\n\\n\r\nNine and Twelve were fine personality-wise. The anime had failed to develop their roles and they were reduced to the roles of two boys who commit terrorist acts. I hoped that the anime would develop Nine and Twelve but it did not. \\n\\n\r\nAn example would be Five, the primary antagonist of Zankyou no Terror. Five is a terrible villain and exists to be evil for the sake of being evil. She was another character who was thrown in to foil Nine and Twelve's plans. Five barely serves any purpose and is there to fill in the 'psychotic bitch' role in the story. \\n\\n\r\nAnother character whom I would like to discuss would be Lisa Mishima, a character whom I feel very conflicted over. Lisa Mishima is the love interest of Twelve and the girl who messes everything up. With a sad backstory, one cannot help but feel sorry for Lisa. Her personality is barely developed and she is a rather unnecessary character. \\n\\n\r\nI think that the character who was the least one-dimensional would be Shibazaki. He had some character development but his personality needs more work. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes were promising. The beginning was decent and drew me into the show, which was different among the many shoujo anime that were common in 2014. However, as I continued watching, I enjoyed it less. The lack of character development and the piss-poor characters was what decreased the enjoyment levels. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror was a major disappointment. I would recommend you to watch the first three or so episodes, but after that, things start to go downhill. If you want to watch Zankyou no Terror for the plot and characters like me, you would be greatly disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum up my review, \\n\r\nStrengths: Art (8/10) and Sound (9/10)\\n\r\nWeaknesses: Story (5/10) and Character (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nHope you found my review helpful. Thank you!",

Terror in resonance (in english) is a heart wrenching story about 2 young boys who escape a governmental testing facility, and cause havoc to bring forth a greater message.\r\nThe two main characters are very interesting, both being brilliant but with different personalities (cool and collected vs spontaneous and fun).\r\nThe artwork is very unique done in a slightly more monochromatic fashion to add eeriness to the scenery and the people. The sound was reallywell done, and you really do feel for the characters, while trying to solve riddles and uncover the truth. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want a touching story of people trying to express the world they live in, and shed light on larger problems through explosions, riddles, and inter connectivity, give this show a try.",

            "content": "This is an almost impossible anime to review without spoiling.   But since so many other reviews cover with full spoilers why to avoid it, I'll give it a try.\r\nThe show has a fairly strong first episode that builds up a lot of mystery... but also already starts with a fairly large level of implausability.  While suspense of belief is part of any show... one that tries to deal with such important, dire topics like terrorism and government overreach, you have to have a reason to keep making it more extreme.  By the end of the show, they push this to farextremes with absolutely no purpose.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters remain uninteresting, undeveloped, and keep creating more and more implausible plans for no strong reason.  A villain is introduced half way through the show that acts completely erratically, and does a full about face for no reason so that... we can reach the stories conclusion that it was heading towards without the introduction of said villain in the first place? Really it's a filler arc that runs for a little over half the show's runtime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, really the most important, this show has absolutely no consistent theme.  Terrorism can sometimes be cool and productive, and sometimes bad?  There's really nothing interesting Terror in Resonance is trying to say.  It has strong visuals and music, and an edgy attitude... but at the end of the day they use backstory to justify a bunch of completely bull**** acts of terror, and it has no meaning, allegory, or anything to real life.  It's a lot of spectacle for no reason.\\n\\n\r\nAlso... literally the worst use of english in a show I've ever seen.  Seriously, find a youtube video of it, it is absolutely hilarious.",

            "content": "Anime is a medium in our society that deals with many sensitive topics such as incest, rape and terrorism and there have been cases where the topics are treated with care and understanding and other ones were it is just in there without any proper thought given on the topic. For example, Koe no Katachi handles the theme of bullying with a lot of care by showing what happens from the victim's and the bully's point of view. But, that sometimes works against it, because the victim who is deaf is treated as a person to feel sympathy and no other emotion. This example showsexactly how even serious topics like this can be unintentionally sensationalizing the events around them and create problems with the story and the characters. Thus, treating such issues as a main topic in a show can work for and mostly against it if not treated properly.\\n\\n\r\nIn Zankyou no Terror's case, terrorism is the issue in discussion. From the outside, the show exudes extreme amount of potential since it is directed by Shinichirou Watanabe and the music is by Yoko Kanno, who is undoubtedly the best music composer in anime. Tackling with such a current matter, especially in Europe and Western Asia, can be trully brilliant. Also, the fact that the story is told from the terrorists' side is even more intriguing, since we get a view from what happens from the other side of the spectrum and why. The motive could be something noble or something appalling but it could give further insight in what led them to believe in such extreme ways to make their opinion clear to the people.\\n\\n\r\nInitially, the show starts pretty good. The first three episodes introduce the main cast and the surface of the reason why the terrorists act in a way that there is no casualty. Nonetheless, after 5 comes into the mix and the logic of the show is thrown out of the window, it becomes like a monstrocity created from a failed exepriment. It is exactly like Dorian Grey. He starts being pretty and young as his portrait but towards the end, the portrait turns even more monstruous and ugly. Similarly, ZnT starts strongly with a great first episode and as it reaches its closure, it becomes worse and more nonsensical and hollow. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is the reason why I was initially intrigued by the anime, since it is rare to see anime dealing with this kind of heavy issues. But, the story is like a tablecloth and as time passes, it becomes dirtier and filled with holes that cannot be sown back. A lot of backstory is left untouched and anything about 5, 9 and 12's past is said by infodumping a la Hitchcock but in a more vague and incomplete way. Personally, the last episode was one of the most racist, illogical and terrible final episodes I have seen the past few years. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst thing about the whole show was actually the characters who are damn straight horrendous. The story is partially at fault here because we do not get time to actually care about them or even like some of them. Lisa is the worst above all since she is your typical damsel in distress with the depth of a Michael Bay character and a personality of a rice cake. 5 is 1D psycho bitch. 9 is drier than Atacama Desert and colder than the Arctic. 12 is the most unstable character in existence. He changes character whenever the plot wishes for it.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, in this soulless piece of an anime, the animation and the sound are excellent and where the reason I watched this self-destructing piece of art crumble to its demise. The animation was handled by studio MAPPA, which was a newfound at the time company by the original founder of Madhouse and for their second anime, they passed the test with flying colours. The character designs are really well-done and the atmosphere and setting is also fluid and beautiful. Thanks to Watanabe's expertise in directing, every frame of the show was close to perfection. Especially the OP and ED of the show were both really beautiful and I never skipped them after watching them for the first time. As for the soundtrack, it was done by Yoko Kanno who is truly a genius. This woman has amazed me a lot of times. All tracks from the ost are great and there is a wide variety, but my personal favorites are lolol, birden, is and nc17. The ED is sung by Aimer whom I hold very dearly in my heart since her songs always gives you ear-orgasms, recently ninelie. As for the OP, it is sung by the singer of Galileo Galilei and his voice fits perfectly since there is a slight sadness, eeriness and despair in his voice which fits the anime. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Zankyou no Terror is like a blank canvas decorated with majestic borders that flaunts its concepts in the shallowest and hollowest manner. It is like having a pharmacy shelf in a museum. It may be considered beautiful and highly acclaimed, but it cannot hide its hollow nature.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.72/10\\n\\n\r\nAlternative Recommendations:\\n\r\n-Ghost in the Shell (1995) & SAC: Yoko Kanno does music in SAC and both versions are deep and handle terrorism in a more detailed-oriented manner.\\n\r\n-Psycho Pass S1: Does not reach the level of goodness of GitS but it is still pretty good and the ost kicks ass, especially its endings.",

            "content": "STORY - 8\r\nART - 10\r\nSOUND - 9\r\nCHARACTER - 7\r\nENJOYMENT - 8\r\nBoom! The shockwaves from the explosion resonates thoughts within me, sending thematical fragments such as isolation and societal fear everywhere. Zankyou no Terror is not a show that is all about terrorism. It integrates a branching set of sociopolitical topics handled in a mature yet compelling fasion.\r\nAfter the first episode, the story intrigued me as it followed two unknown boys who picked a fight against Japan. This is not just a story about the acts of terror. Yes, there were society, terror, and panic, all creating a parallel to the bigger issues of our realworld. Combined with the presence of media and this anime enchanced realism which was evidenced by the first few episodes. We get a plot that can be thought as a split, one on a methodical approach that focused on the two opposing forces, with the planning and executing or the solving and responding. The other part was on a deeper level that took place during the establishment of backstories and characters, creating an aura of mystery that surrounded the MCs. However, as the story progressed, a couple of issues started appearing with the introduction of the main antagonist. While she can be entertaining, she was too lackluster, seemingly serving as a contrived plot device barrier that led to the breakdown of the integrated realism. And the terrorist boys along with girl they 'recruited' had a bland motive that were only answered towards the end, and even then, it wasn't fully explained to conclude satisfyingly. But that said, they served well in the story with their personality. Not terrorists just for the sake of terrorizing, they harbored a multilayered personality, having a caring and antagonistic side to them. The police side was handled well, adults shown as people who strived to protect society from danger, using their intelligence and skills as effectively as they could though at times I did find some to be too favorable. I also find the scientific elements to be a nice addition. The interesting riddles informing a handful of Greek mythological trivia on their terrorist name, Sphinx, showed an interesting implication to think about on their actions.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was without a doubt the best part of the anime, with qualities that competed with that of a movie. Overlaying the scenes with the apparent vignette effect darkened the setting, generating a tonal feel in the art. This was a good complement to the sense of mystery enveloping the boys of Sphinx. Movement-wise for the most part, it had a good and fluid animation. Explosions and smokes were full of detail, showing the damaging power, a true essence of fear. Along with the city sceneries, the character designs were realistic, particularly in the diverse facial features of the character. Expressive attitudes were shown in their faces, presenting lots of emotions and thoughts coming out. For a thriller with suspense at its core, the audio slowly built up to the dramatic scenes very effectively. The seiyuus voiced each of their respective characters in a great way. While the terrorists had that almost treatening demeanor in their voice, the members of justice held frustration and anger under their breaths, taking me inside their thoughts during their investigations. Combined all together and the anime had an atmospheric vibe which were only heightened up by the moody background soundtracks that played frequently throughout. Another thing that stood out to me was the opening sequence. It felt mesmerizing and hypnotic, and totally contrasted to the darkness of the story's visual by taking on a brighter color pallete. Definitely a unique one that I've seen so far as it steered away from the tone of a lot of the openings in other anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the narrative goes, it stood rigid until the explosion was dropped, becoming a shaky structure of unbalanced characters and slight forcefulness nearing the end. Though look from far away and the scorching orange-red clouds from the detonation turns into a beautiful mix of visual, with the shockwave boom that fills you with goosebumps. With the issues in mind, Zankyou no Terror still delivered an interesting take on the idea of terrorism, giving you a number of themes and questions to think about from an individual and societal point of view.",

            "content": "this is one of the very few anime which mad me cry. I am a person who rarely cries and masks and hides emotions but Zankyou no Terror especially the ending to this anime which i will not ruin had brought my emotions out too an extreme extent of only of sadness but of questioning and wonder.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nI found the story for zankyou no terror very interesting. The broad and shallow story was about terrorists. Nine and Twelve. However, the story goes much beneath what the eyes can see, it is a complex and very mature story which cannot be easily seen.\r\nIMO Deeper Story: 9/10\r\nWhati believe the story of zankyou no terror is the corruption of power. Nine and Twelve spent a lot of time just to spread news about what had happened which was the corruption of power which can be seen throughout the story with the covering up of the experiment for the children who were taken away from a young age to be cruelly drugged and mentally tortured by words and drugs. This is clearly so illegal but was easily covered up for a along time until somebody attempted to uncover the truth about this experiment. Soon to be uncovered once again by Shibazaki kenjirou.\\n\\n\r\nIMO Secondary Story: The accomplice gathered along their way got involved into the plot of the attempt to reveal the truth of corruption without fully knowing as they were slightly forcefully dragged into their plot which lead to many complexes and stories. I once again believe that doing this and having them as a main character brought light to her slightly different \"traumatic\" experiences from Nine and Twelve both being very serious.\\n\r\nFive also had to deal with the trauma that Nine and Twelve had to deal with but she had to continue after they had escapes leading from a small extent of lack of sense to pure insanity towards Nine created by the mental torture and abuse and the drugs sideaffects.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nthe art which was created fits perfectly into the scenery and the style of the show which was very action-packed but also the very chilling, cold and slightly uneasy show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe music which was added to zankyou no terror was very good added almost another whole layer to this anime which was the side story and irony of their name being VON with what they did being \"terrorists\". The music was also very calming and quiet yet so fast paced and interesting at different scenes with suspense building scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nNine and Twelve were obviously very different characters being polar opposites nine being smart, very cool, calm and collected, twelve being very childish and energetic. They both had their counterparts not being each other to an extent. Nine being Fives with Five being very smart, yet has a very short temper and easily looks down on other which is very different to Nice. Twelve's counterpart being Lisa who was seen to be fairly simple or bland, i believe that she was made to be that way with her up-bring with her being very shy and having a difficult time having no one to talk to, once again being very different to what i believed to be their counterparts.\\n\r\nUnfortunately i believe Five was portrayed on the bad side but her personality was very hard to create which i believe was made to at least a decent extent. which lowered my character rating by a very so little. Other than her all the characters had their down and upsides but they were, IMO very well done.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nWow. that's all i can say, this was an extremely well made and sought through anime which was astonishing in my eyes, however i tend to be a very easy rater for anime. What i thought of the anime is up to you to agree with!",

That show is now my number 1. all around favourite anime of all time.\r\nIt had everything that I want in an anime and it presented every element so well! Down to the last frame of the ending credits, this show was stylised / animated immaculately, had its characters fully developed, kept its plot interesting and fully engaging and the soundtrack was absolutely perfect.\r\nI will preface the rest of this review with the fact that this anime is not the 'pop' anime that appeals to a wide audience... the story, characters, art and sound of Zankyouno Terror are subtle, engaging and very artistic. I wouldn't go as far as to say it was art house, but every aspect of this anime was stylised just how Watanabe intended.\\n\\n\r\nThe themes of this anime, even without the violence are very mature, I would not recommend this to anyone below the age of around 16.\\n\\n\r\nI know some people weren't a big fan of the 11 episode structure and the pacing that it brought. I was a little also skeptical, however, I never found the story rushed or so slow that it was boring. It spanned the perfect amount of time for the story and allowed all of the characters to develop and unfold along with the developments and twists of the plot. I was worried that after I finished the last episode I would long for more, however, the ending was so perfect that I am happy with it being finished.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking specifically about the ending (no spoilers) the final twist that was introduced added another dimension to the story that perfectly wrapped things up. Without the addition of this it would have left what was a very well spanned closed story much too open. I also love the fact that they give a final 'one year later wrap up' tying off ends with the few other main characters from the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was created to perfection by the incredible Yoko Kano! When I first heard that she was creating the soundtrack for ZNT I automatically thought it would be a very up beat 'bebop' style soundtrack, however I found that the the many subtle tacks (such as Lisa's theme) to be very beautiful, as well as still having exciting 'up beat' tracks for the action scenes!\\n\\n\r\nThis music tied in also with the art style. The art in this anime was very refreshing for me, as the integration of the CG and hand drawn elements were so flawless that it felt very reminiscent of classic golden or silver age anime. The details in everything from everyday objects to explosions of buildings were spot on and created a great sense of realism in this anime's world. The bleak, simple colours of the characters contested beautifully against the full saturated colour of the world around them.\\n\\n\r\nThe depth of the story and characters is incredible, with many subtle themes playing out through plot devices such as the constant mind games between the main characters. The main characters of the story are introduced with the audience knowing almost nothing about them. As the story progresses and the plot develops you learn more and more about the main two and grow very attached to them and their background. The use of only minimal characters in the story allowed for each character to be thoroughly developed without the pacing becoming to fast.\\n\\n\r\nWatanabe and Yoko Kano have really outdone themselves with this one... I loved every second of it and will be waiting for a box set with 5.1 and then re watching this again and again and again!\\n\\n\r\n10/10",

And then you stop noticing things, because there isn't much after that. \r\nThe story is good enough, it isn't something we haven't seen before, though it does surprise you from time to time. \r\nThe characters aren't really that unique either. The main protagonists are your clich\u00e9 super smart teens, the main antagonist is a super smart female teen, and there is an above average smart detective, and a not-so-smart girl that is not really useful in any way to the plot because theonly thing she does is get in trouble, forcing the protagonists to save her.\\n\r\nThere isn't much character development (this being an 11 episode anime), besides the protagonists and the detective. Which is a shame.\\n\r\nThe voice acting ( I saw it subbed) is great if you don't count the times they try to speak in english.\\n\r\nThe whole anime gives me a Death Note feel to it, in parts regarding the police work and the whole cat and mouse chase, but it doesn't transmit it as well as Death Note.\\n\r\nOverall I think it is a good enough anime, but what really steals the show is the art and music, not to mention that the last couple of episodes are a bit disapointing and rushed.\\n",

One of the best animes I've ever seen.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe theme terrorism is really delicate and you have to treat it with great care. But Zankyou no Terror managed to do everything right. From the first moment I wanted to know everything, what's happening next and why it is happening. I really love stories who use intelligence and this story is using it perfectly. There were many things which came with great surprise to me. All in all I always wanted to see the next episode immediatley and were extremly impatient to know whats happeningnext.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nIt's nothing extraordinary, but it doesn't need to be, because there are so many other great parts who make up for it. Nevertheless it's pretty to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nOh, how I love the Opening and the Ending Song. It's really special and leaves you with an uneasy felling wich fits perfectly in the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nI believed everything the characters did and say and I'm convinced the real people would do the same thing. I especially liked, that there were no character who just fullfilled a certain purpose. They were all very good characterized without having to use much time for explaining. The story also didn't try to make some characters espacially likeable. I somehow love everyone even though I really hate some of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI allready said everything. I extremly enjoyed every minute and in the moment I'm extremly sad, that it's over.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10",

            "content": "What an incredible show - (it's 2am right now and I've watched the entire thing through from the beginning to end in one full gulp). Just to give a gist of it, Zankyou no Terror is an honestly intriguing and moving story about four teenage boys and girls (Nine, Twelve, Lisa and Five) who struggle to verify their existence in the world.\r\nYet, I do have many conflicting perspectives about the series. For instance, it has used terrorism as a plot device during a time when it has become quite a sensitive topic (in light of ISIS and what they're doing around the world right now).Nevertheless, this show is clearly not about terrorism and is definitely not justifying it either. It really looks at one reason of the many reasons why youth join terrorist groups: to make their mark in history.\\n\\n\r\nBut I cannot forgive one thing in this series, and that lies in its gender ideology. The character of Lisa Mashima is the most frustrating female lead that I have ever encountered in light of all the shoujo manga that I've read in the past 6 years. The constant crying, sobbing and asking \"What should I do?\" to Twelve and Nine is hugely problematic to say the least, and offended me at many points throughout the series as a female. Of course, this series was clearly aimed for men, but with the villain also being a female, and the way that both major female characters are over-sexualized was taking it too far.\\n\\n\r\nThere was also an issue with the depiction of America. The incorporation of English was daring and admirable, I will admit. But the series didn't have to go as far as depicting the United States as the ultimate villains; the finale was also taking things too far in this respect.\\n\\n\r\nThough, I suppose that you could also interpret there to be a parallel storyline, in which Japan tries to reassert its identity throughout the series. The police are constantly battling against the power of the USA offscreen; and you could also see Nine and Twelve as symbols of Japan instead, the city of Tokyo being an alias for 'the outside world'. \\n\\n\r\nNow this is why the series, despite all of its glaring flaws, is still considered to be one of the best I've ever seen. The number of layers of interpretation of this series grows as you reflect and think about it more and more - it's as if each one is like a single soundwave of an echo that keeps going through your head.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it is this echo - this resonance - that's running through my mind at the moment; I'm still buzzing from finishing the last episode of the series. Altogether, it is heavy, powerful and telling; it makes you truly reflect on experiences that have past in a critical manner. I encourage everyone that is willing to go on both an intellectual and emotional journey to engage with these films as soon as you can. Don't be afraid of the title - which is named \"Resonance of Terror\"; it's quite a misnomer actually. Instead, cover the \"of Terror\", because this series will impact you one way or another, and you will be able to hear the echoes of these characters for a long time to come.",

            "content": "I went into this series attracted only by its premise and high scores on various rating platforms. Had I realised that WATANABE Shin'ichir\u014d had directed and KANNO Y\u014dko written the soundtrack, I would probably have gone in with much higher expectations\u2014which probably would have had me a bit more disappointed.  As it is, I loved how the series was presented, in terms of visual and sound design and its thematic elements, but a few major elements did dampen my overall impression.\r\nThis series shines in its first five episodes or so and its ending. Its greatest strength is thematic: and despite the initial premise ofterrorism in an alternative-universe present-day T\u014dky\u014d, the core themes don't seem to be about terrorism at all. In this, I agree wholeheartedly with waluigia's analysis in a previous review. The story is revealed to the viewer primarily from the point of view of the characters 9 and 12; the terrorism they commit is portrayed from the point of view of the post-war Japanese national identity, the scars left by the end of WWII and the American occupation, which gave rise to the project through which and institution in which 9 and 12 were inhumanely raised; this is certainly a novel point of view of modern Japanese society to me, but being disconnected from modern Japanese society, I cannot particularly elaborate on this series's treatment of it. The much more personal themes of these characters' rebellion, both youthful yet mature and serious in nature, and their isolation from society and other people by their background also play a key role in this story, in particular in MISHIMA Lisa's role in the story\u2014both in her own upbringing and isolation from society, very different from the other characters', and in her relationships with 9 and 12.\\n\\n\r\nThe mood and atmosphere of the series were exceptionally crafted. The combination of detailed, emotive characters, the use of contrast in foreground art, with beautiful background vistas, and colour palettes that always fit the mood of a scene made for a stunning visual experience. I am even more impressed at KANNO Y\u014dko's sound design: she has masterfully married musical composition to scenes, to create sensations of relaxation, anxiety, foreboding, fear. I greatly enjoyed the breadth of musical influences, from post-rock and art rock, to Romanticism and Impressionism, to modern Minimalism, choices which were, of course, ever suited to the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire story, and the ending in particular, do not necessarily make the themes and messages passed through those themes evident to the viewer upon first watch. The ending reinforces the idea that their ultimate goal was to send a wake-up call to the entirety of Japanese society, which contradicts certain implications of vengeance against those involved in the project that created 9 and 12 as they are, which I read from earlier exposition. As I think more about it, the more I can harmonise the events of the plot with the thematic message of the series, but I feel as if this series deserves a re-watch and some time to reflect upon it: the interleaving of themes and nuance, I believe, gives this series a strongly literary quality to it, a characteristic that is shared among many of my favourite series.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, there are certain specific elements of the series that detracted significantly from the whole.\\n\\n\r\nDevelopment of character was, overall, subtle but appropriate for 9 and 12. Although they are characterised as archetypes initially, their background and hence their motivations are developed, forming the basis of their well-roundedness, and their changing relationship with each other, with Lisa, and with their mission allows the viewer to see a certain level of character evolution. However, the major failures in characterisation were Lisa and 5. Lisa, I admit, was far more interesting to me than either 9 or 12 at the beginning of the series: although her portrayal as a timid high-schooler who gets inadvertently caught up in events is fairly archetypal in anime, I was expecting her to evolve: on one hand to work through her emotional and social issues, on the other hand act as a foil to 9 and 12 thanks to their both being social outcasts. But that never happened, and she remained an ever-useless puppet to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe other failure, not only in characterisation but in plot, for this series was the antagonist 5. This, I noticed, was a common complaint for the series: the character's past and motivations are not significantly developed, and in her work with the FBI against 9 and 12, she acts childish and petty and takes incredible risks to carry out her plan, apparently with the FBI's full support for the most part. I felt as if I were watching a typical villain genius of the genre, who would stop at nothing to carry out some impossibly convoluted plot against the protagonists. The series failed to suspend my disbelief at that point, contrasting so starkly with the much more realistic earlier episodes. Ultimately, she becomes an emotional hook to the plot at the end of her arc, with little additional explanation of her past or her relationship to 12.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, despite its weak points, the series remained mostly compelling throughout its narrative, bolstered by intriguing and well-presented themes, beautiful art and atmosphere, and exceptional sound design. While the plot and its focus on the antagonist 5 failed to be entirely convincing to me, and perhaps wasted time where other aspects of the narrative could have been more fully explored, the series managed to convey its themes well. It has left me a lot to think about, and perhaps a bit of reading to do on post-WWII Japanese history and the current social and cultural identity.",

            "content": "It really is hard for people to branch out and do something they wish to sometimes. For people who like to escape from the social norm and do what they find meaningful, sometimes society is unforgiving. They get labeled as freaks, undesirables, and even monsters. So you could imagine my surprise when a well respected director, Shinchiro Watanabe, decided branch out and cover a very, very sensitive topic in the anime \u201cZankyou no Terror.\u201d\r\nIn this world, there is one thing that is widely considered one of the worst things a person could ever do, by both the types of social outcasts mentioned prior and \u201cnormal\u201dpeople alike. That thing\u2026 is terrorism. Users on MAL, I bring you my rewritten review of the anime Zankyou no Terror, that instead of exploring terrorism itself and using it as paint, uses it as the paintbrush.\\n\\n\\n\r\n---PLOT---\\n\r\nThere\u2019s something horrible happening to the Kanto region of Japan. Two terrorists that go by the name of Sphinx have been setting off bombs in seemingly random public places, leaving only a vague riddle as a clue to why they are doing such a thing in the videos they post prior to their attack. But, instead of attacking the populace directly and demanding ransom, they make sure there are no casualties in their attacks, and don\u2019t ask for any kind of compensation. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Zankyou no Terror opens with an act of terrorism, and in todays world, covering such a subject in a public television program could almost be considered \u201ctaboo\u201d because of just how many horrible things have happened in recent memory, things so heavily hitting to society that I don\u2019t even need to say what they are, and anybody reading this will already know what I\u2019m talking about. But instead of exploring this kind of terrorism directly, Zankyou no Terror, or as I will call it from now on, Terror in Resonance, leaves its true meaning shrouded in complete ambiguity for almost its entire run.\\n\\n\r\nTerror in Resonance initially begins with a formulaic story; Sphinx, comprised of two young adults that go by the names Nine and Twelve, hide a bomb in a populated area. Immediately after, a riddle that usually involves euphemism of the Greek tragedy Oedipus the King is posted to Youtube, where the police division must solve the riddle and disarm the bomb. Their first attack, with a tremendous amount of planning, miraculously leaves no deaths, and very little injury.\\n\\n\r\nThe series\u2019 appeal is propelled by the viewer\u2019s burning desire to discover Sphinx\u2019s motive. Why would they ever destroy buildings and then bother to save those inside? What could possibly be the reason behind their attacks? \\n\\n\r\nWith the execution of Sphinx\u2019s goal being so \u201chush hush,\u201d it creates a morally undefined atmosphere where you don\u2019t truly know whether to cheer the main characters on or wish for their devious schemes to come to an end. It\u2019s so unclear as to whether they\u2019re actually antagonizing Japan for a good or a bad reason that the anime allows itself to cover such a plethora of topics without ever outlining one specific message. Terror in Resonance explores the feelings of social outcasts and injustice, national pride, and the decisions between right and wrong not always being so clearly understood. In this sense the underlying theme or message of the anime is almost entirely up to the viewer\u2019s perspective, and there is a choice of what you yourself wants to take away from the show, even if the message that was intended is set in stone. \\n\\n\r\nTerror in Resonance succeeds entirely at being the type of story where the whole point is up to interpretation. Its only real problem at accomplishing is the amount of plot devices the anime uses to get its points across. Sheer waves of \u201cconveniences\u201d glare in your face if you actually pay attention. How did Sphinx acquire the resources to actively invade a nuclear testing facility, and steal the one thing kept completely under wraps there? What about their ability to make and detonate explosives? Why does there seem to be only being one competent police officer in the task force? WHY DO THEY NEED TO GO TO HIGHSCHOOL? \\n\r\nIf the anime had bothered to shed light on so many of these questions then the realism of Terror in Resonance would be all the more terrifying, and for what the anime likes to pander through, realism is something that is far more than just necessary. It is what creates the tension in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nAnd not only this, but the plot seems to go off on a tangent as time goes on and loses its believability even more with ridiculous shenanigans and unrealistic police procedurals and legal reprehension.\\n\\n\r\nBut even if the suspension of disbelief for this show is so utterly ridiculous, it is still, after all of these contrivances, able to use terrorism as a ploy for recognizing other social issues really ****ing well. And at that, it is a fantastic metaphor, where instead of having realistic occurrences, has realistic emotion.\\n\r\n---Plot Score: -Great- ---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---CHARACTERS---\\n\r\nIn the world of Terror in Resonance, the minds behind the terrorist group of \u201cSphinx\u201d are two seventeen year old boys, who instead of going by their real names, or even plausible aliases, go by the numbers \u201cNine\u201d and \u201cTwelve.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSphinx\u2019s backstory is quickly alluded to but never fully realized until much later in the anime. Their position of being terrorists comes off as a mixture of being curious and deplorable, and their personalities are the definition of contrast. Twelve is easygoing, and somewhat absent minded. He\u2019s the type of warm, carefree soul who just really doesn\u2019t give a damn, with a smile compared to the sun. Nine is almost the exact opposite of this. He\u2019s easily concerned and never opens up, always keeping to himself. The type of person to become lost in thought, and is unforgiving, with eyes compared to ice. \\n\\n\r\nThe duo shares the same goal but have completely different ways of wanting to go about accomplishing it. They are, for lack of a better explanation, two sides of the same coin. In all honesty it\u2019s a phrase overused to elaborate on the two but it\u2019s absolutely true. This portrayal of a distant, yet brotherly relationship is very well composed, when one considers their past. \\n\\n\r\nOn another positive note, there\u2019s Kenjirou Shibazaki, the detective who stuck his nose into business he shouldn\u2019t have many years ago, and has since been moved to a different position in the police force. His past is one of resent, and his characterization is very solid overall, as he is demonstrated as the type of person who likes to take charge of a situation even if it isn\u2019t really his place, and is a natural born leader with a \u201cno nonsense\u201d attitude. I\u2019d even argue the possibility of him actually being the main character, and not Sphinx, simply because of his amount of screen time. And not only that, he seems to be the only police officer who can do his job.\\n\\n\r\nThese three are the ones who make up the \u201cgood\u201d portion of the cast. But the anime has two other characters that pull the quality of the cast down, one of them being exponentially worse than the other. These two characters are the main antagonist, Five, and the girl who got caught up in Sphinx\u2019s first attack, Lisa Mishima. \\n\\n\r\nLisa\u2019s serves as the \u201cdamsel in distress\u201d character who can\u2019t seem to do anything but get herself into trouble. She grew up in a home where her mother was so protective of her she regularly became hostile, and her father likely left because of it. Her actual personality and history are so relatable for many people and difficult to swallow that she ends up being sprinkled with some fantastic realism. But her whole purpose is just to be one gigantic plot device, and that utilization is an insult to her actual depth. She\u2019s constantly in harms way, and is always having to be saved by Sphinx. I felt like she could have been used in a way that didn\u2019t disrespect her as a person. But despite her shortcomings, the impact she has on Sphinx, especially Twelve, turned into a refreshingly warm interaction, one that made the sympathy that was hung over Sphinx\u2019s head much more genuine. Because of this, I feel she is a fantastic character who was simply used incorrectly. \\n\\n\r\n-Potential Spoiler-\\n\r\nBut one character that just cannot be redeemed is the lead villain, Five. Her schemes were almost entirely unnecessary and undeniably ridiculous. She came in and wrecked episodes six through ten, and is nothing but bland and unappealing, shoehorned in for the purpose of revealing more emotional trauma and backstory of the main characters. If she were to be subtracted from this story, the quality of the cast would ascend greatly, because the story would have been able to go in numerous directions.\\n\r\n-Potential Spoiler Over-\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, the faults of the few do not destroy the entire experience. The other characters, despite Lisa\u2019s poor role, were perfect for the anime.\\n\r\n---Characters Score: -Great- ---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---ANIMATION---\\n\r\nI have never seen an anime produced by Studio MAPPA before, and I have to say, they nailed everything they possibly could have. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is absolutely gorgeous. Explosions are intense, fast movement is outlined by different levels of light and darkness, and objects like metal and glass have some of the most realistic \u201cglares\u201d this side of the Fate franchise.\\n\\n\r\nThe color palette is filled with dull greens and blues and dark hues of gray and black, and some of the characters, like Twelve and Shibazaki, aren\u2019t similar to anything I\u2019ve ever seen before, and incredibly unique in design. Wood furnishings, buildings and fire look great, its like every scene is kissing your eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThere was a scene in episode one where it was all entirely shot from a first person point of view on a snowmobile, and the flurry of snow and speed fluidity was so convincing you could just feel the ice in the wind.\\n\r\n---Animation Score: -Amazing- ---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---SOUNDTRACK---\\n\r\nThere\u2019s nothing better in anime than being treated to A+ animation and a stellar soundtrack, and Terror in Resonance continues to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has some of the most beautiful music that I\u2019ve ever heard. There is not a single bad piece in it, and it has this relaxing, soft sound that occasionally delves into despair or pure eeriness. Not only that, but the ending song, \u201cDare ka, Umi wo,\u201d preformed by Aimer, was really one of the only anime endings I didn\u2019t skip; I sat there, and listened to it every single episode. It was fantastic.\\n\r\n---Soundtrack Score: -Amazing- ---\\n\\n\r\nAFTER REPORT:\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n- Unique and original; surpasses social boundaries of what can be covered in a television program\\n\r\n- Incorporates real world problems into narrative\\n\r\n- A few great characters and beautifully portrayed emotion\\n\r\n- Amazing animation, godly soundtrack\\n\r\n- Interpretable messages \\n\r\n- Genuine mystery; you want to know what the hell is going to happen\\n\r\nMIXED:\\n\r\n- Could be off-putting because of subject matter (Terrorism)\\n\r\nCONS: \\n\r\n- Poor utilization of other characters, sometimes not as fleshed out as they could have been\\n\r\n- Suspension of Disbelief heavily hinders a \u201crealistic\u201d setting\\n\r\n- Formulaic first few episodes (this problem doesn\u2019t really fix itself, as soon as it loses its \u201ccrime of the week\u201d it screws itself with Five\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: -Great-\\n\r\nWith as many problems as this anime has, it doesn\u2019t ever dip down below anything less than great in its performance. Even if it did have its fair share of messy script writing, its messages and mystery overshadow them as much as they possibly can, and sometimes the emotion demonstrated in the show throws the production values in the garbage, and ends up being the most impressive part.\\n\\n\r\nShinchiro Watanabe\u2019s \u201cZankyou no Terror\u201d is actually somewhat of a controversial anime, with many mixed scores. But with all of its Pros and Cons taken into consideration\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\u2026I gratefully award Terror in Resonance with a well-deserved 8/10\\n",

But not all Psychological anime can keep me satisfied.\r\nThis is one of those series that suprises me and many other viewers, again and again.\r\nStory~8/10\r\nWe start our thrilling adventure in Tokyo, a great big city, where everyone can't get attention.\r\nLittle to no backround information about the characters is given in the beginning. We learn about the tragedies that will haunt our three main characters for the rest of their life.\r\nOur three main characters that are bound together by friendship, blood, sweat and desire, are about to tell you their story.\r\nArt~10/10\r\nThe animation in Zankyou no terror is very wellfitting to this anime. My first impression when watching this for the first time was that the creators used some type of gray filter. I'm really thankful for that, the filter is amazing in providing the mysterious and thrilling filled space.\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful, realistic and fits perfectly with everything else in the anime.\\n\r\nBoth opening and ending is well made with a gorgeous artwork.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound~10/10\\n\r\nThe OST for Zankyou no terror is one of the highlights. The music is produced by our beloved Yoko Kanno, Known for making the amazing music for anime like Cowboy Bebop, Porco Rosso, Wolf's rain and much more. Music is something that connects us to the characters that we se on screen. So you haven't felt the connection between the characters and you? Well look no further,  Zankyou no terror shows you how it's done. The show contains a CD with eight teen well produced songs with excellent quality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters~7/10\\n\r\nZankyou no terror has one of the most unexplained characters that i've had the pleasure to watch.\\n\r\nThey are realistic, unique, and convincing.\\n\r\nWe have Nine who is a mastermind in his early twenties that is trying to escape his horrible and inescapable past.\\n\\n\r\nTwelve is a young man that has two sides. A child-like one and an adult one. He treats Nine like a big brother.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Lisa, our most interesting character. Sadly we don't get to know much about her throughout the episodes. She is always in the way and is very often pushed away, at least that is how she describes herself. However she makes a difference and has a big effect on Nine and Twelve.\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment~10/10\\n\r\nIt feels weird to rate ten out of ten here. But Zankyou no terror is probably the best anime of the 2014's Summer season, for me it was the best i had seen in years.\\n\r\nI have seen people complaining about the loose ends and the things that they left out.\\n\r\nWhy not take the show for what it is? Maybe all the mysterious and unanswered questions is what makes it so beautiful.\\n\r\nIt was a great ride.",

It did not spoil gravity of the plot with cheap fan-services and try hard jokes (Unlike some really popular animes *cough* fmab*cough* ). Nothing was out of place.\r\nThe plot was highly intriguing. However, in the end, it feels a little incomplete and did not quite quench my thirst (May be i had my hopes too high, especially after the first few episodes ). It is not a broken storyline, but it does leaves some questions unanswered (mostly about Five's involvement, like how did Five survive and how did she became so powerful in the US intelligence, whatis the real deal with her and Nine ). The conclusion was not as powerful as the beginning. And unexpectedly (,unnecessarily and un-subtly ) snipping off a favorite character seemed more like a frail attempt to shock you into a cathartic ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound really blended in with each other and the story. The music was really moving. And the art was neat was well.\\n\\n\r\nThere is little character development (but its understandable considering the length of the anime and the time-scope of the plot). However the characters were convincingly coherent. I really loved how they were close to life and not the that's-how-they-do-it-in-anime characters. May be the only exception is Five who felt life a textbook anime character (even by the looks). Lisa indeed seemed shoehorned into the plot (as i read in another review above), with a vague backstory to fit her in, but I liked her.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment peaked in the first half and flat lined till the last episode with some spiking at the end. What I like most was how true the art style and anime as a whole stood true to the seriousness of the plot.

            "content": "Ok so I honestly fell in LOVE with this anime (wanting to buy it). I mean there is so much detail with the art direction (Just look at the first episode and you can tell with how they animated the characters when walking to school, and when Lisa is running down the stairs while the building is falling. The blur and effects gives the animation more a live action theatrical look). This is an anime where you have to pay attention to what every character says and does to understand the whole story of whats going on...\r\nLets get started!: \r\nStory: 9\r\nOk I love the overallstory and idea. I mean the characters we are suppose to be rooting for are the \"Bad guys\"-which is a nice little twist. Although they never to kill anyone and even go out of there way to make sure people are out of harms way.\\n\r\nThe problem with the story? There isn't enough episode! This isn't just me being a fan girl wanting more episode for my enjoyment (although that would be nice) but it seems like the anime just scratches at the surface. There are many mysteries and stores left untold...like what was it like in the lab? What was 5 relationship with 9 and 12? Specifically whats 5's relationship to 9? Why didn't 5 leave the lab with them?What was the big deal with the chest game?  Why happened between the years 9 and 12 after they escaped the lab? What happened to Lisa at the end, did she go back to her mother?\\n\r\nWe get little bits and pieces of VERY short flashbacks and dialogue but never go deeper then that. It is like this anime is trying do SO MUCH, which isn't a problem it is the fact that is only has 11 episodes to tell the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art and animation is AMAZING! The Ferris wheel scene and the bike scene are just perfectly done! Nothing else to say (which is why I gave it a 10)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nAgain very well done it is not overdone and adds to the scene (Which I think is very important and why I also gave it a 10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nSadly the characters suffer the same fate as I stated with the story-although it suffers more only giving us basis of the characters personality. I think the two characters that suffered the worst were 5 and Lisa (with the character I found the hardest to understand was 5). You can TELL there is more to the character which is a shame. I mean I would have liked to see Lisa have interest or do something besides being clumsy (like having a hobby or doing something that she is actually good at to develop her character that is buried under all that self conciseness).\\n\r\nIt is even worst for the side characters...where you don't understand some of why they do what they do. I mean the detectives go to a guy who was part of the research lab and he just tells them because....no real reason given besides he is old?\\n\r\nAll I am confused as to why 9 and 12 join the school at the first episode..then never come back to the school (with it being summer break the next day? or something). What?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nEven though this show had a hear wrecking ending I still enjoyed its interesting premise and story. This anime is defiantly one of a kind and almost had me crying (which I can say is a lot more then most anime done for a while-since the ending of Angel Beats). Why do I do this to myself? I don't know..haha but I still enjoyed the anime and can say that this anime has tons of rewatch value.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThis anime is the closest I can say to being perfect (-it is close but no cigar). A bold statement I know but that is my opinion on it. The only problem is the lack of episode to spread out-and allow for more in-depth look at the characters.\\n\r\nI mean I admit I do not like the ending but it's realistic (although I do wish the ending was different). The characters are interesting (despite not being able to go in depth on them), the art along with the music is amazing, and the overall story is intriguing. Posing some very philosophical questions. Is what they are doing right? Should they actually be considered terrorist?\\n\r\nThe overall tone of this anime is dark (if you don't mind that) and as mentioned before I think it has great rewatch value.",

It does not glorify these activities, but considering the material and some blood and violence in places, I would say it should be a 14+. However also considering the storyline itself, I feel like it might be better enjoyed and clearly understood by more mature teens, so maybe a 15+. It also heavily hints at one of the maincharacters having a mental illness: depression. Take your own guesses from that and the official certifications.\\n\\n\r\nRecomendation: Subbed, I believe the voice acting is better and has more emotion, however I have watched the dub all the way through as well and it is pretty good!\\n\\n\r\nGenre: thriller/action/mystery, however it has many quieter and softer moments that are just essential for a good anime, that allow you to get to know the characters some more and just understand so much.\\n\\n\r\nReview: \\n\\n\r\nZankyou No Terror is a beautiful, exciting and engaging anime. While the first couple of episodes may be confusing and perhaps a little off-putting for some as you may feel as if you are watching criminals and understanding none of it, if you follow the general three episode rule (always watch at least three episodes of an anime to give it a chance. If you still aren't even remotely interested, then maybe it isn't for you) some small mysteries are explained and the excitement begins as you are allowed to see some more of what is going on. The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful, one of the best I have ever listened to and it adds so much atmosphere and feeling. It is timed perfectly with pacing and really does so much to match the mood of the scene - and change yours. The animation is realistic (for an anime, as in most everything is well proportioned, the faces and postures are drawn well, the landscape is amazing) and each character has distinct and different facial features and expressions that really say so much about their personality. The development of both the story and characters is very skillfully done and in just thirteen episodes this anime lets you feel like you know the characters. You begin to get a sense of who they are and what they want from episode one, and even the smallest details like how they smile in different situations or little things in their masterfully written and shown backstories just make them seem so much more real. Finally, before I start squealing about how much I love this anime, I'll just end on the fact that I think this anime is a must-see, whether you are a massive fan of anime or not. I think it has an ability to speak deeply to you in some way, no matter who you are, and I honestly believe that through the course of this anime your views and feelings will change from what you felt at the beginning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFUN FACT: \\n\r\nIn an interview with Otaku USA Magazine director Shinichirou Watanabe stated that the music of Icelandic band Sigur R\u00f3s gave him visual images that inspired the series and its soundtrack. He also states that the team went to Iceland to record the music.",

Before watching, I read its plot and to be honest, I really found it interesting so I checked it out immediately. The first few episodes were really good. It kept me wanting to watch more and finish it asap. The whole terrorism stuff got me. Didn't expect it would turn out to be bland. The show could've been something more. I didn't really see that much development on the later episodes? Also, I felt like the female protagonist was rather pointless???? Like she weren't really much of a help? Therewasn't any significance at all. Also, suddenly introducing a friend turn enemy without a properly explained reason turned me off. Well, there were a couple of flashbacks when the show felt like it but that's all it is. There were just a lot of unanswered stuff even though a conclusion was reached. Anyway, this show was such a letdown for me and again, it could've been something more.",

I was replaying moments of the show, especially the ending, over and over in my head. Then the theme song started playing on repeat in my head. I realized, this is something special that's only happened to me with a few other shows. Death Note. Tokyo Ghoul Season 1, Game of Thrones. And Doctor Who. \r\nThe issue of terrorism is an interesting and different premise. But it's presented in a way that is flipped around. Thetwo main characters never actually hurt anybody.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Nine and Twelve are unique. Twelve seems to have this childish optimism at times, whereas Nine just wants to get the jobs done and is set on the mission. \\n\\n\r\nShibuzaki, the detective assigned to the bombings case, is pretty much a basic brooding detective. Until the end. where you can see a little bit more normality in him. Sometimes he solves the riddles a little too quick to be realistic. But overall, he's just okay. \\n\\n\r\nLisa had a really unique backstory set up. She has an abusive, controlling mother, and an eating disorder, which would have been neat to see the show try to explore. But after the third episode. Her character becomes a bland female protagonist that's only around to get kidnapped so that Nine and Twelve can save her. \\n\\n\r\nHowever. I do praise the animators on character design. They're very unique. Lisa has bushy brows and small eyes. (Unique traits that we usually don't see in anime) Twelve has a really friendly smile at almost all times. sometimes you can't even tell what he's actually thinking.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are pretty crisp and realistic.\\n\r\nI adore the ethereal tone that some of the ost carries. \\n\r\nThe theme song is beautiful, stayed with me for days. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this show a 9/10\\n\\n\\n",

The potential it had to be a masterpiece was there though, so overall I would consider it to be an amazing anime that deserves a watch.\r\nThe characters were interesting, and the aspect of mystery made the show so much more interesting. The action scenes looked fluid and the art style is polished. It obviously can't compare to the production value of more recent anime, but I liked how stylistic it was, and I'm sure any anime viewer will be able to appreciate it. Interactions betweencharacters were a little awkward at the start of the show, but once you get to know more of their background, you'll be able to better appreciate why they are the way that they are. It's definitely an anime that is thought-provoking, so if you like that in your media, then you might find something enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nI found Lisa to be rather annoying, since she has the sadly, common victim mindset. This is however, mostly due to the circumstances of her life. The main antagonist's motives are questionable, but considering the background that the main characters share, I don't find it surprising. The main problem that I do have with this anime though is the ending that felt a tad bit rushed. I would have liked to see the story fleshed out more before the conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's an amazing anime that I would recommend to any new anime-watcher, but I wouldn't consider it to be the masterpiece that several others regard it as. Do put it on your plan to watch list though, since it's definitely one that you shouldn't miss.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this review!",

            "content": "Zankyou no Terror is a psychological/mystery thriller that will evoke memories of Death Note in the way that the two main characters \"Twelve\" and \"Nine\" play with the police. The story makes use of many riddles and mysteries to progress the story while also alluding to the past so the viewer can understand the characters' motivation. With that said, there was poor development of \"Five\" (one of the main antagonists) which ultimately felt a little rushed and brought the overall story of the anime down. The anime had excellent music which really brought the story to life and its worth the watch.\r\n{Story} - The storystarted out excellent and I was engrossed in the mystery and psychological aspect from the very first episode. The problem the story ran into was their introduction of \"Five\" as an antagonist who was very poorly developed and really distracted from the main story. We are never given a reason for Five's interference other than she \"is continuing a game from the past\". The story did have a very interesting and complete resolution which saved it from its downward spiral.\\n\\n\r\n{Art} - The art in Zankyou no Terror was nothing special but was certainly not bad. The only time it really stood out was in a moment when Twelve began to talk about his synesthesia (the ability to see sound). Other than that moment, it was pretty average but not bad.\\n\\n\r\n{Sound} - Zankyou no Terror made excellent use of music throughout the anime and the opening and ending pieces were both excellent. I had no complaints about the sound or music and it definitely added to the flavor of the anime.\\n\\n\r\n{Character} - Probably the weakest point of the anime. In an 11 episode anime, its difficult to give any depth to the characters and this really came through with both the two female main characters. Neither felt like there was any character progression and both felt poorly developed. I had originally planned to give the character section a 6/10 score, but ultimately decided to bump it to a 7/10 due to the development of the detective Shibazaki who was developed quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\n{Enjoyment} - While the middle of the anime suffered due to the introduction of Five, the anime was quite enjoyable due to its incredibly fast pace and psychological/mystery aspect. I binge watched all 11 episodes in a row and never got bored (although Five definitely detracted from the show). \\n\\n\r\n{Overall} - Overall I gave Zankyou no Terror a 7/10. The show had excellent potential but suffered from poor character development, poor character motivation and a few plot holes. If the show had been given even one or two more episodes to flesh out the backstory on Five a bit further, it may have saved her entire \"arc\", but the lack of displayed motivation to the viewer really felt unnecessary and dropped this anime from an 8/10.",

Also, I didn't have any particular expectations especially that there are 11 episodes only. Personally, I take series of such length under different criteria.\r\nRight after the last episode I peeked at reviews out of curiosity. What astonished me was the quite repeating complain that Zankyou no Terror isn't exactly about terrorism (as the misleading title suggests). I mean, of course the two main characters weren't real terrorists (who have killing people in theirdefinition) and that's exactly the point. They don't mean to kill any people and to spread so said terror. I just want to point out that I don't consider this to be a disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nBoth main characters, Nine and Twelve, intrigue as their motives for planting bombs aren't specified at the beginning. Same goes to \"the message\" they are trying to tell. We get to know their personalities as well as glimpses on their past which led to their later actions.\\n\r\nSimultaneously, Misa is introduced. She may appear as another helpless girl in trouble but she was wrapped in plot nicely and had her five minutes. Psychologically, I could imagine how she could feel in certain situations and that's why I didn't find her actions annoying at all. Misa was really trying her best. Simply a lost soul in cruel world.\\n\r\nI like how the work of police was shown when it came to dealing with mysterious \"Sphinx\". They weren't simple dummies making shallow decisions. The highlighted character of detective Shirazaki plays his role well. I liked how he challenged Sphinx in their riddles and was trying to follow their way of thinking.\\n\r\nThen a true villian showed up. Five. Honestly, here is when I felt disappointed as her actions seemed chaotic and kind of unreasonable while she was playing the role of \"the bad one\". Although she was meant to have a plan I actually felt she did not (agh and that constant switching between English and Japanese). I didn't understand what her point or real grudge towards Nine and Twelve was in general.\\n\\n\r\nOther thing which bothered me a few times was a bit unbelievable coincidences or mmm convenient incidents which allowed the plot to proceed smoothly. For example I was impressed with quite unprobable vast knowledge of Shirazaki when it comes to mitology. Unfortunately, it's very noticable in certain moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe show, in my eyes, is great when it comes to psychological aspect. Thinking about the main characters, you can immerse into their feelings and perhaps thoughts, too. The atmosphere is always held right so getting involved in what's happening in their hearts and minds is almost inevitable. To be honest this is the real beauty of Zankyou no Terror to me. Although there wasn't much space for character development, I found it satisfying and quite open to interprete. After all, it's 11 episodes. The story itself is bizarre and it may appear pathetic as a whole but I think it's more natural to focus on characters' personal experiences. It makes this series much more enjoyable and beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation itself was absolutely smooth and the way characters are drawn was very detailed. I loved watching this work. Also, the colours of (detailed as well) background were very atmospheric just like the lighting. Same goes to the music. Everything worked perfectly with each other.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend Zankyou no Terror to those who would like something more serious, emotional and with high level aesthetics.",

            "content": "Zankyou no Terror (ZnT) was rather interesting. Admittedly, there were several inconsistencies and needs-for-improvement, but it brought about a different light to the nature of terrorism, politics, and how people are in general. \r\nTo put it loosely, the series revolved around two young terrorists who staged riddles as to where they planted bombs around Tokyo. This usually serves as a hook for an audience, posing the questions: What are the answers? Who are these kids? What is their objective? Will they get caught? As the story progressed, it is revealed that there is more to these casualty-free attacks than just simple nationwide harassment. \r\nMore characterswere gathered along the way: allies, foes, and the like. A problem was that although many of them may have been relevant, there was no substantial information on their backgrounds or reasons for their actions. Several silly loopholes, magic solutions/scapegoats, and confusion were also present. Examples of these are (will be vague to not spoil those who haven't seen ZnT): why is it that no one was really visibly afraid of the terrorism - after 3 explosions, I'd like to think that people wouldn't want to go outside anymore; the investigator magically had the solutions and his daughter just happened to be a physics major; what game settling; why chess; why, 5; why shoot; why... many things! \\n\\n\r\nThere were also infuriating portions in the plot where it seemed to be confused whether it was a psychological thriller or a romance anime. I chose to believe that this was part of character development (or down-velopment, ahem), and that fulfilling mission isn't all there is to how a person lives. Moreover, our lovable terrorists chose a very roundabout way to prove their point. \\n\\n\r\nIt must be mentioned that the art was above-average, satisfying. There was nothing too special nor bad about it. In terms of the music, I have the same opinion. \\n\r\nThe Engrish portions, however, were very upsetting. Seiyuu attempting to speak another language can be appreciated, but not at the cost of intelligibility. There was a vital portion at the end of the show that I completely could not understand, and this added to the disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nWhat proved interesting is what was highlighted during the close-ups of the police team investigating the terrorism. In a government bureaucracy, there is a usual dichotomy of what my conscience tells me vs the orders of the boss. The series takes this a step higher by adding how following this chain of command is affected by relationships on an international scale. Given all these factors, there are sentiments of hyper-nationalism (at whatever cost) from the recent world wars, which actually caused the terrorist movement in the first place. This provides an even more compelling twist.\\n\\n\r\nGenerally, ZnT was rather enjoyable. I may have rated it a little high considering all its loose ends and its lacking backstory. However, I find that the message the plot was trying to convey was unique and deserves special attention. With a little ironing out, it would have been an even greater anime.",

            "content": "**WARNING: THE \"ITS ENDING\" SECTION INCLUDES SPOILERS! IF YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE RUINED FOR YOU, SKIP IT**\r\nThis is my first review so take it easy, no?\r\nThe way I got thrown into the show that is Zankyou no Terror, I was listening to its OST, and it had caught me right away. When I read the small description, I was actually quite interested in what the anime was about, and soon after I started watching it.\r\nAfter finishing the show in one go, I can definitely say that it did have an impact on me to quite an extent.\r\n- FIRST IMPRESSIONS -8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode really did reel me in with a POW! It was wonderful, having been a long while since I haven't seen any anime with such a powerful start. Within the first episode it had some rather interesting dialogue that I will definitely remember. I can guarantee that it made me click onto the next episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- PLOT & STORY -\\n\r\n          7/10\\n\\n\r\nFor an original anime the plot itself wasn't as bad as I've seen people say, it was really refreshing to see something like this, but there were some points where the plot had become somewhat confusing and there were a bit of plot-holes within the story. But on the first go, they kinda blew over my head so it's not as noticeable unless you were to REALLY look at every nook and cranny of the anime. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed it! Overall it had a very strong premise, but the execution of it could've been done a tad better. (Perhaps there's a chance it could've been even better if there were more episodes in order to tell us a lot more information, but I digress.)\\n\\n\r\n- CHARACTERS -\\n\r\n        6/10\\n\\n\r\nI suppose one of the flaws in this anime were some of the characters. Although I really did enjoy them at the start and was hoping for quite the character development, it didn't really progress through the series. I'd say the extent of any character development would be on the last episode with Nine, but even that isn't very much.\\n\\n\r\nNine and Twelve - With Nine being the serious and mature one while Twelve being the exact opposite, I really did enjoy their character. One for the fact that they hint at something very big at first and two for them being polar opposites and yet companions. (It could've been taken into a different direction from what the anime had set up in my opinion) But although I knew their backstory, it didn't exactly tell us how they became this way. They were more like glimpses which doesn't help with development much. And I wanted to wish for a growth or maybe a tear in their bond together, to show what's deeper beneath them besides polar opposites. \\n\\n\r\nLisa Mishima - At first she seemed more like a stereotypical shy type, and I was kind of skeptical to her character and her impact to the show. But at times she is pretty useful, but not useful enough. \\n\r\nFor example: It says the she is a main character, but most of the show focuses more on Sphinx and the Police. She doesn't do anything in particular that impacts the show as much as the others, even when Twelve tries to talk to her. But I wouldn't say she was a BAD character, per say. She actually had some potential with the relationship between her mother and the reason why she had run away in the first place. Looking at her as a whole she was at least a fair character, she just doesn't have much of an impact for me.\\n\\n\r\nShibazaki - He was not a bad character at all, really. To put it simply he was a very clever person who had always been doubted by the police force. I wish they had put more info into his backstory and himself in general since he from the get go, was already interesting from the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nFive - If I were to be honest, she was kind of annoying. What bugs me about her character (and could be classified as a plot-hole) is that she has gotten away with almost everything until someone FINALLY stands up to her after the damage has been done. Yes, she drove the story along but to me she was more like an obstacle than an actual character... She definitely had a lot of potential for developing many others in the show though. Sadly, that didn't happen as much as I'd hoped for.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough not very developed, I did get rather attached to them.\\n\\n\r\n- ART -\\n\r\n  9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who loves to draw, I LOVED the artwork and detail that had been put into the style! The lighting was good, and it really brought me into their world. The character designs were sort of generic, but the style of the characters was something noteworthy in my opinion. Overall, it was quite a breathtaking experience!\\n\\n\r\n- SOUND & MUSIC -\\n\r\n           9/10\\n\\n\r\nFor sound, I'd say the voice actors did a pretty fine job and it impacted me a lot. The music for this anime was on point, and when each track played it definitely fitted in with the rest of the scenes! (I recommend that you listen to all of the soundtrack by itself!)\\n\\n\r\n- ITS ENDING -\\n\r\n       9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs it had built up, I was on my toes the entire time from episode 10 to 11. Finding out more about what \"The Athena Plan\" was and more foreshadowing of what's to come. I knew what was going to happen, but I didn't expect it to happen in such a shocking way. Nine breaks down to the point where he's crying, and I had burst into tears as well. Although it was heartbreaking (I was REAL attached to them, okay?) I really can't see it end any other way. But it did carry a rather deep message and reveals why Sphinx had done this. They wanted to be remembered for what they had gone through, because they were basically property that nobody could care less for. Used and thrown away. And so Shibazaki had granted their wish as they faded away. It had a bittersweet ending, but I was incredibly satisfied with it. \\n\\n\r\n- OVERALL ENJOYMENT + CONCLUSION -\\n\r\n                              8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs an original anime, it definitely is much better than most I've seen! The references to Greek mythology keeps you captivated, it has an interesting concept, fairly good characters, the pacing was excellent, and the sound and art is just fantastic! (It'll bring you right into their world!) \\n\r\nDo I recommend it? I'd say so. But for those of you who are VERY into plot and development, there may not be much for you.",

            "content": "Zankyou no Terror is a good anime.\r\nFirst of all, let's begin with this, so you're not tricked into thinking this is a show about terrorism and the morals around it. Because it isn't. It really isn't anything I expected when going into it.\r\nWhether or not I recommend it, is a bit of a complicated question, but I'll ultimately say no. There are definitely some good - even very good - parts to this story, but I just can't recommend it. Or can I? I mean, fuck, it's difficult, alright?\r\nGoing to deep into what the story is actually about is kind of risking spoilers, but I'lltry a spoiler-free version: Zankyou no Terror is about connectivity. Not just between two people, or about someone who's on the outside of societal norms, but a society. Also, it's about the Japanese climate and generational gaps, in a post-war society (even if the show has a modern setting). It's just a shame there's so much in the way to actually get to that. Well, technically it's always there, but it's just not \"stated\" that that's what it's about. Sure, us viewers have to read into things as they happen, but sometimes it can't help to kinda lead us to what were supposed to get out of it. Eh.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, ZnT centres on a duo of young men, Nine and Twelve, who fashion themselves terrorists with a cause. Nine is the classic silently intelligent bad-ass you often see in anime. Twelve is another stereotype - the hyper individual, with a magnetism that pulls people to him. Initially Twelve seems to have the interesting twist of being a psychotic emotional manipulator, but that quickly goes away to reveal a pretty normal guy, minus the terrorism angle. I won't go too much into the attacks and repercussions themselves, but I will say that the show definitely veers hard away from very serious terrorism stuff - is, I guess, how I'll put it. They call themselves Sphinx 1 and 2, and the series starts with them stealing a nuclear device. After that, they go to record and upload videos with them forecasting bombings, and basically daring the cops to do anything about it. They challenge the police to solve puzzles related to Greek mythology. So, those of us who aren't read up on Sophocles' Oedipus just get to kick back and watch the story unfold.\\n\\n\r\nAmong the police trying to solve Sphinx' riddles is former detective Shibazaki, who got taken off the force in the past for investigating police corruption. He's the series' most interesting character, in that he actually has a fully developed character. He feels like a more mature L Lawliet, without the eccentricity. He knows what man-made disasters can do to a country, and will go far to stop Sphinx' plans.\\n\\n\r\nInto this mess, Lisa Mashima is pulled. She's a schoolgirl that's bullied by the other girls and seems to generally hate life. Her mother seems incredibly  Twelve injects himself into her life, which has huge consequences on both of their lives. There is potential to the Lisa character, for sure. She could have offered another, but still parallel, viewpoint to the Sphinxes', and help to further explore all three characters. That doesn't really happen, though, or at least not soon enough. She plays the damsel in distress and is portrayed as being quite ridiculously useless. Her bad cooking is played for laughs, because anime stereotype. Her arc ends up in a pretty good place before the series crashes and burns at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is excellently animated. Absolutely gorgeous. The music is also a stand-out, behind which is industry veteran Yoko Kanno. One song has guest vocals from the vocalist of one of my favourite bands, Agent Fresco (whom you should definitely check out, yo). The soundtrack does its job superbly well, and adds to some very good scenes.\\n\\n\r\nYou know what? Fuck it, I'll recommend it. If you can bear the really bad (\"the bad\", obviously being relative to what you enjoy from your anime) of this show, there's a story there that kinda deserves to be seen. To quote myself from earlier, because I can, \"It's just a shame there's so much in the way to actually get to that.\" Cut a couple of episodes, especially the parts with the nonsensical and oh-so-uninteresting villain that you can see a mile away after watching the first episode if you've seen a couple of anime series' before (seriously, the villain and its cadre, and its actions and reactions from the local police are fucking terrible ends up being a ridiculously awful addition), and focus on the more personal and cultural story. Hell, it could have worked very well as a longer feature film at like 2 hours or so.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it's a troubled, yet good anime that has something to say , even if its message gets a bit lost in between its sometimes crazy antics. It's not getting a whole-hearted recommendation, but I think it's worth checking out. At the very least, it at least tries to stand out from most other anime released today, and that's worth something.",

How would Five know which piece he meant?\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, after all the crazy things she does (blow up a plane, etc etc.), it takes until the last episode for her command to be relinquished? There's no way the US government would take that long. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the US government, can you even snipe someone through a moving helicopter? And also, if Nine and Twelve wanted to live, they had ample chance to get away from the choppers. \\n\\n\r\nWhich leads me to the part where Twelve dies.

            "content": "Zankyou no Terror \u2013 \u201cAre you going to destroy the world?\u201d Terrorism and extremism are now used almost one in the same as many believe it is only extremists who can be terrorists. That their only goal is pure destruction of society and it doesn\u2019t matter what it takes and many lives it takes. So what happens when terrorists are highly calculating teenagers who will only set off bombs when there is no chance of a causality occurring? \r\nStory: 7\r\nLisa is constantly bullied at school and has an overly obsessive mother, so when one day two new students show up and one of them startstalking with her. Later she goes to mall where she runs into the boy again who gives her a present. After crying herself asleep in the bathroom she awakens to the fire alarms going off. Suddenly she gets a call from that boy, saying that she has two choices.  Either help them bomb the building, or die. \\n\r\nThe developments keep us on the edge of our seats, just as any good thriller should. The riddles given to help the police are interesting, if albeit confusing for those without an extensive knowledge of Greek mythology. The whole story line really cannot be predicted as one would really need to get into the complex minds of Sphinx to figure out what the next plan is. But as Sphinx plays cat and mouse games with the police we start seeing an ongoing theme. That Sphinx will soon either be found out or tell the great secret they are hiding. Unfortunately most of this great build up is almost thrown out the window the moment Five shows up. Gone were the riddles, gone was the development as to why Sphinx was doing all of this. All for the pure reason of showing more explosions are creating more drama. These developments left the real reason for the bombings to only be discovered by a side character. And when the reasons finally did come to light they leave almost no time for a proper explanation of Sphinx\u2019s actions.\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nSphinx, the terrorist duo who has captivated the attention of Tokyo as they await where they will strike next. They escaped from a research laboratory after setting part of it on fire and have since been on the run, all the while holding a strong hatred towards the government and others who worked with the laboratory. Nine is the mastermind behind Sphinx and thinks of the plans and how best to execute them. He is very cold and calculating leaving nothing to chance. Despite being shown as devoid of emotion he cares for Twelve as a brother, but states he would kill Lisa without a second thought if she gets in his way. Twelve is the \u201ccomedian\u201d of the group, surprising really since his job is deliver the bombs that could potentially kill hundreds of people he is very light hearted and constantly making jokes and laughing, much at Nine\u2019s expense. Unfortunately neither really develop into anything other than Twelve falling in love with Lisa. \\n\r\nAfter being recruited as an accomplice Lisa stays with the duo as she too wants to destroy the world. Lisa very much draws those that want the current world to burn to ashes, who are bullied every day, and have a horrible family life, and having no one to turn to. She constantly wants to help, but in the end usually causes the duo to rescue her. She becomes accepted near the end but isn\u2019t till the very end that we see her change.\\n\r\nThe detectives could of a better developed group of characters, but only Shibazaki gets the attention needed to make great character. He quickly starts to understand the riddles given to the police and soon takes the case very personally. Unfortunately as Five is introduced the fighting between him and Sphinx come to an end as he is tasked with finding why they causing all this chaos.\\n\r\nNo terrorism show would be complete without a visit from the Americans. And the moment they get involved it escalates at an insane pace. The taskforce is headed by Five, another child from the laboratory. In order to fulfill a personal grudge she constantly engages in her own outlandish, and deadly, acts of terrorism as she knows fully well that Sphinx will stop her. By far one of the most insane characters I\u2019ve seen. I kept asking myself would the American government actually permit an agent to potentially kill hundreds of people just to settle a grudge? The answer is no. Her character only adds drama and when the show comes to a close, she had no effect whatsoever \\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9\\n\r\nThe art is shockingly good coming from a brand new studio. A lasting characteristic of anime is the big eyes and unrealistic faces. However we are starting to see a trend in creating more realistic characters so that we have a chance to relate to someone who looks like us. So the characters in this anime look very real. The looks add weight as we are more likely to take them seriously when we see the icy stare of Nine or the psychotic smile of Twelve. Apart from amazing characters the whole animation was beautifully smooth giving the explosions and collapses an almost \u201cbeautiful\u201d look. \\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nKanno Yoko once again reminds us just has amazing she is. She took control of every part of the music you hear and she did an absolutely astonishing job. The OP and ED just run chills down your spine as they give a sinister vibe that can\u2019t be matched. The OST is also very amazing with all the songs fitting the whole atmosphere of the anime. The voice actors were also very good, though I do hate how they have to have the worst \u201cEngrish\u201d speakers ever. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nThe whole anime is very original, and since studio MAPPA was able to bring in most of the staff from the legendary Cowboy Bepop, the hype only increased. And I can honestly say they met the standards of that hype. It\u2019s depressing when a hyped show falls short of what it could or should have been, just look at both Sword Art online seasons. I always say that whenever anyone makes anything they always strive for perfection, and Zankyou no Terror was close to touching. Yes they made mistakes here and there, the story could have flowed together more, and the characters could of more development. Yet despite minor fallbacks the show as a whole is something everyone will quickly agree as the best of the season. \u201cRemember us, Remember that we lived\u201d Don\u2019t worry Sphinx, we will remember.\\n\r\nOverall Score: 6.7\\n",

            "content": "Alright, so I want into Zankyou no Terror not really knowing what to expect. With a title like Terror in Residence I was a bit confused as to what the overarching plot and characters. One of my friends told me not to just expect EXPLOSIONS, but I was still curious.\r\nThat's why the show is so great. You go in not knowing what you are expecting and you come out surprised. The show is incredibly well made, with a great plot up until it's final few minutes (the last three minutes killed the ending for me), and the characters are quite complex as well.\r\nThe first thingI'll say about it is the art style. A lot of anime don't try anything different with their art style, and that's what shows like Zankyou no Terror do amazing, they make you pay attention to the art style as well, ensuring that it looks different and catches your eye over the generic anime art. The OST is also quite amazing. The music in the episodes fits perfectly and is amazingly done, and the opening theme is brilliant, alongside an excellent end theme (which are often not done enough justice).\\n\\n\r\nNow lets get to the good part. The characters. All four... I guess you could call them protagonists... have some aspect about them that makes them feel a lot more human than someone like Natsu Dragneel or Naruto whatever his last name is. One of them has difficulty attaching himself to people because of his past and what he is doing now. Another always feels like they have messed up because of some action she took. Another has difficulty letting go of the past.\\n\\n\r\nEach of the main characters are likable, and the antagonist is just that more frustrating. And there is an air of mystery surrounding (most) of the characters, even the antagonist. Each character feels unique in some way.\\n\\n\r\nNow to the one thing that annoyed me. The last few minutes. The best way to describe it would be that, while the group was on a break, Gen Urobuchi snuck into the animation studio and put in some of his sadistic brilliance into the ending. It felt like it came out of nowhere, like it was a last minute decision that had now explanation whatsoever. While it is quite sad, it also left a bitter taste in my mouth from the greatness that was the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I will say about Zankyou no Terror is that, once it gets going, it's hard to stop watching... Which really sucks when you have school and homework... But seriously, I recommend watching it.",

I wanted to see why they were doing it, what was their goal, how did everything tie together. My problem is with how everything was coming together towards the end. It seemed like they just had to have an ending so they pulled that together in an hour.

            "content": "As I type this, I have finished this series less than 30 seconds ago. Though the minute details are still fresh in my mind, I am sure that over time, they will fade. The story, however, will likely remain with me for years to come.\r\nI will start by saying that I waited to watch this show. I watched the first episode shortly after it aired, and though I was interested, I found my attention span waning over time, and did not watch the rest of the series until I began to marathon it a few hours ago. I think it was the best decision Icould have made, because watching this show on a weekly basis would have been incredibly difficult for me. I feel like the impact it made all at once was far greater than what it would have been had I watched weekly, and if possible, I would recommend others to watch the show in a single sitting as well.\\n\\n\r\nNow, on to the actual review, which will be spoiler free.\\n\\n\r\nStory (10):\\n\\n\r\nThis is not a story to be taken lightly, and is certainly not for the faint of heart.  There are many parallels to be drawn to past events, such as September 11th, the bombing of Hiroshima, and many others that can hit very close to home for some. I leave this warning because if you are able to handle the grim nature of this show, you will come out on the other side a changed person from having seen this show. Combining a beautiful dose of both drama and mystery, \"Zankyou no Terror\", or \"Terror in Resonance\" tells the story of two teenaged boys that, by all accounts, don't exist. They go by the names of \u201cNine\u201d and \u201cTwelve\u201d, but more on them later. As we quickly learn, these seemingly innocuous boys are actually a duo of terrorists by the name of \u201cSphyx\u201d. Their first mission, bombing a government building, is successful and they quickly gain notoriety from the media. One of their main goals is to prevent any deaths by their own actions, and their first mission results in no fatalities. Lisa Mishima is drawn in by the two after accidentally seeing their plans in action, and becomes an \u201caccomplice\u201d rather than face certain death. As the story progresses, we watch as Sphynx and the Japanese Police Department, among other groups, fight to carry out what they believe is right, or in some cases, to stop other parties from doing as they wish. The dynamic of the back-and-forth between all parties is a unique concept not often seen well (or done well) in anime. The ability to always stay two steps ahead of other parties while also completing their missions is a fascinating thing, as well as Sphynx\u2019s repeated riddles, giving the viewer the chance to feel as though they are an investigator as well. It is an interesting take on the very realistic issue of terrorism in our world today.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9):\\n\\n\r\nThere are four characters that I will note here (there are other important characters, but as this review is spoiler free, I will not mention them here): Nine, Twelve, Lisa, and Shibazaki. Nine and Twelve, our infamous duo, offer a dynamic not unlike that of ice and fire. Nine sees the world with dark shadows looming around every corner. He is cold and harsh, but is also very caring towards Twelve. In contrast, Twelve often wears a smile and has a demeanor much like that of a child. The two, together, are incredibly smart, with planning, building, hacking, and many other abilities not often seen. Lisa Mishima is a high school girl who meets both Nine and Twelve when they transfer into the same high school. She is an outcast, often bullied and struggling with problems at home. Given a sudden choice of life or death, she decides to become an \u201caccomplice\u201d of Sphynx, and becomes the only person who knows of their plans. Shibazaki is a former detective with the Japanese Police Department. He follows the case closely as it happens, and becomes the one to solve Sphynx\u2019s riddles. He chases the terrorist duo with no regard for his own well-being, and is relentless in his search for answers.\\n\\n\r\nThough all of these characters are strong and well thought out, I almost feel as though there was something missing from many of them. I still have questions about some of the characters that, while not essential to the progression of the story, still remain to nag me. I feel that their personalities could have been further delved into, explored in a deeper capacity. But alas, it did not happen. What I received, however, is far more than I could have asked for in the first place.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound (9/9):\\n\\n\r\nAt first, I was rather put off by the animation style of this show. It was different from anything I had seen in the past, and therefore, quite uncomfortable. However, as I watched, the style quickly grew on me and I began to realize the real beauty within it. It is a hard feeling to describe, but for me, it evoked a sense of danger within me. Something telling me that this show was not going to be easy to stomach. And it was right. This unique style of animation fits the feel of this show perfectly. The sound is quite similar. The opening is quite unsettling, yet mesmerizing at the same time. It never failed to draw me in. There are also many other tracks within the show that are beautiful on their own, and the voice actors certainly deserve praise, but my expertise in sound and animation are both rather limited, so I will spare you of any more of my confusing analogies.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10):\\n\\n\r\nThis show forced me to ask myself this question: What really is enjoyment? At its simplest, it is a feeling of joy evoked by an outside source. But this show did not make me feel joyful. If anything, it made me feel almost depressed. However, the fact that it could create such a feeling within me on its own is quite impressive, and the fact that my eyes were glued to the screen every moment cannot be ignored. This is a strong show, one that will make you feel things you may not have believed an anime could make you feel. Though I did not feel much in the way of joy while watching this show, the many other emotions that swelled within me as I progressed can justify my reasoning for giving this show a 10 for enjoyment.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9.5/10):\\n\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve said before, this show can absolutely not be taken lightly. It is an experience that can change a person, one that makes you question the difference between right and wrong, good and evil. If you are prepared for such a changing journey, albeit short, you will not regret your decision. This show has the ability to move mountains, metaphorically speaking, and is something that those who have seen it will remember it for years to come for its beautifully disturbing and realistic tale.",

            "content": "Lately I have been mostly reading manga, and have been reluctant to go back into the world of moving pictures, but Zankyou no Terror had managed to get me excited about anime once more. Now lets start with the review itself.\r\nZankyou no Terror tells us the tale of two seventeen year olds, who are determined to exact revenge upon Japan, for the horrors they have experienced during their childhoods. They resort to terrorism, blowing up buildings and such in Tokyo.They operate under the name Sphinx as they give out riddles to the police, so they have the option of preventing the accident from happening, ifthey get it right. On one occasion, when they are blowing up a large commercial building they happen to involve a girl, to whom they give the choice to either join their organisation, or die in the explosion. She naturally chooses to live and from there on the story then follows the trio on their quest.\\n\\n\r\nThis has to be one of the best realised story I have seen in a long while, and what is even more impressive is that they manage to pull it off in only eleven episode. The story begins harmlessly enough, with the main character presented as just two runs of the mill terrorists, but the development of the story afterwards, shows us everything, their backstory, motives, and much more. Here we encounter the first problem as some of these explanations come on far to late, and while in the end everything becomes clear, you are left in the dark for most of the anime. Throughout there were many thing that threw me off initially, however everything was brilliantly explained in the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing unfortunately is nowhere near perfect, as the anime seriously looses its pace in the middle when the initial action calms down. Fortunately the pace picks up soon and the the ending episodes are nearly perfectly done. Speaking of the ending, there are a few other anime that manage to conclude as well as this one. There is a logical conclusion following the events of the anime, and while the ending itself is not exactly cheerful, it brings peace to the watcher. Well anyway the story is great, and while there are still flaws, it manages to tell us a compelling tale, that shows us an unique outlook on terrorism, and also handles many more important themes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters could have been one of the highlights of the anime, but unfortunately there are a few problems, that that made me unable to enjoy the anime as much as I would have been able to otherwise. \\n\\n\r\nAs I have mentioned before, the anime is really stingy on information it gives us, so while the story as such is not overmuch impacted by this, it is extremely hard to grow attached to characters, if you are given little to no information on the basis of their actions. This might have been done to invoke some kind of mystery, and on some level it accomplishes that, however the anime is not built upon that, so in the end it comes off more as a distraction, than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nThe other problem comes from the lack of personality of the some of the characters, especially our main terrorist duo Nine and Twelve, as well as their nemesis Five which joins the party in the middle of the series. They even lack normal names, being called only by numbers, which sounds strange, especially in the sub version, as the English words stick out far too much, but at least they manage to pronounce them correctly. Other then the lack of a true name they do come out a bit too artificial, which has to be attributed to their upbringing, even though it still does not make make them any easier to get attached to.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I have finished with my complaints, it is time to give the characters some praise. Lisa our female lead, is absolutely amazingly portrayed. First shown as a lonely high school girly, dealing with a broken up family and constantly being bullied by her classmates, she slowly evolves with the help of Nine and Twelve. I have to say I felt companion toward her and that is more than I can say about the rest of the characters. The thing is she never becomes a full out terrorism god, but becomes more and more confident and useful, without ever becoming unbelievable.\\n\\n\r\nAnother highlight is the police force lead by detective Kenjirou Shibazaki, who is leading the investigation against Sphinx, and who I consider to be the fifth main character. The police managed to actually pose as a serious adversary for our heroes, but at the same time they are not presented as all-knowing, so the conflict comes out as quite balanced. That all changed when Five entered the picture, but I wont go further then saying that her presence becomes overbearing quickly, as I don't want to spoil anything. The supporting cast is great as well, if a bit underdeveloped, but what can one expect to get out of eleven episodes. We got many characters that appeared on screen only for a few minutes, but still managed to get stuck in my memory.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say I\u2019m split on the art, as for the majority of the time it was mediocre at best, but there were moments where the animation really shone. You see the character\u2019s themselves are nothing special visually as well as the backgrounds, however there were points where everything changed, and the anime puts forth some of the most beautiful scenes I have seen in a while. This is all the more pronounced, as these parts are accompanied by some really great music, but more on that in the next paragraph. The anime\u2019s colour palette is a bit subdued, focusing more on greys and blues, but still there are some bright colours thrown into the mix. The action sequences are done well enough, but sometimes the choreography leaves a bit to be desired. Fortunately for an anime such as this there is no fan service at all, as that would distract us from the story and that would be a shame.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime sounds fantastic. No matter how you look at it, the soundtrack is nearly perfect, it might not be able to match up to something like Noir, but it is still downright amazing. The opening track Trigger, by Yuki Ozaki is a fantastic electronic number, featuring some great vocal work backed by some interesting instrumental music. The song manages to provide the perfect mood for the anime that follows it, and the intro animation also fits the music neatly. The ending, while not as good as the intro is also impressive. Dare ka, Umi wo performed by Aimer, the band that made the unbelievable ending for the anime No.6, is a nice relaxing track that helps us reflect on the events of the episode and calms us down. The rest of the soundtrack is mostly mostly instrumental and fits the events onscreen perfectly. Surprisingly there is next to no repetition, and no track overstays its welcome. Now all of these songs are going directly into my iTunes library when I manage to get my hands on them.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it all up, Zankyou no Terror an outstanding anime, that manages to tell us an interesting and unique story. While there are a few points where further improvement would be welcome, such as some of the characters and the animation quality, its positives outweigh the negatives easily. As such, I can wholeheartedly recommend the anime to anyone looking for some quality viewing, only beware as this is not the happiest anime out there. My final score for it would have to be a 9 out of 10 (however I have been thinking of changing the rating system so this rating is not permanent). \\n\r\nI would really like to get some feedback as to improve my further writing efforts, and feel free to check out my slowly growing collection of reviews.",

            "content": "Story: 10/10\r\nYeah,I knew it would be a good Anime because of the influence of Watanabe (one of my favorite Producers and Story writers) but i have to admit i didn't expected it to be that good, it was actually like a masterpiece to me. At the start i was thinking that 11 episodes can't be enough to make a story really good (or they let it finish with a cliffhanger) and i was expecting that i will see something good but only the beginning of it. Then i realized how fast and intense the story goes, one action after another, with not boring scenes, justpure important story scenes which were perfectly balanced, with much drama,action but also sad and deep parts in it and i think that's what made me like this anime so much.\\n\r\nThis Anime reminds me a lot of Death Note which is probably a Masterpiece for almost every Anime lover out there. The fight between people, genius people, showing their dreams and hopes in the things they do (I would like to call it Art) - It all was just like it was in Death Note, one more aspect to say that Zankyou no Terror is probably also a Masterpiece.\\n\r\nI already said i added some influence of my personal enjoyment to the RATING, but i haven't done that without reason - so if you want to understand what i mean, watch the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are some characters i really like in this series, more than 3, and that's really rare for me - i usually like only one character in a anime and support him to the end, but here it was a bit different, good ones or bad ones, it didn't matter to me, i supported both sides because each side had a character with some important background story and can feel with the character trying to understand what he is thinking and why is he doing some things he does in the anime.\\n\r\nThere are also characters which i liked just because of how they act, it was a little crazy kind of acting which was really interesting for me and i really enjoyed to watch them.\\n\r\nAlso Nakazawa Kazuto made a really good job designing the characters, like always!\\n\\n\r\nAnimations: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nTo the beautiful part - The animations had that special art which is much more used in Animated Movies rather than in TV series and this was perfectly fitting with the story, the characters and everything else. The people who made all these animations did a really nice job, the characters and the surroundings are really beautiful and had many different colors which made the \"movie\" style even more movie like.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Opening and Ending theme - it was good, but compared to the anime itself it was far away from being even close to \"that good\"\\n\r\nBut what i really like is the background music, with all that jazz and blues music, with random drum blasts at random moments - just great!\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is one anime i will surely watch again in a few years, and not many anime series get that option to be in my \"plan to watch again\" list.",

            "content": "Zankyou no Terror...I'll give you a quick review of what I thought of this anime!\r\nFirst Impressions: After watching the first episode. I knew that there was a reason why this became my first priority anime to watch before the Summer Animes were aired. The trip only got better throughout the episodes.\r\nStory --------- 23/25 ---------\r\nReally unique story here - we have two young boys that are terrorists - bombing various places in Tokyo, but guess what? They aren't regular terrorists. No, not at all. They not only have a reason for doing this, but they have a unique method of how they do this, and it'sdone in a way where no one gets killed. Or is that so? The story is really deep, and the arc lasts throughout the whole series, which is why this anime doesn't feel too rushed in any ways. It's something unique, and I was very interested in the plot here - being the first anime I found that was announced back in winter 2013 or spring 2014 that I added to my to watch list.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation & Art --------- 14/15 ---------\\n\r\nI love the art in this anime. It's subjective of course, but I feel that the art here is very well done - and it fits the situation of the anime very well too. The animation is smooth, though the art for a large mass of people may be a bit less clear and clumpy. Fortunately, everything that's actually important is well animated! The explosions are pretty, the movements are smooth, and the emotions on people's faces are well shown\\n\\n\r\nSound --------- 19/20 ---------\\n\r\nThe music in this anime is incredible. I've been listening to the soundtrack for a while now after finishing the series, and just...Wow. Some of the music is especially unique, including the disturbing \"lolol,\" a quick-paced \"saga\" (my favorite), a strange sounding, \"ess,\" and some really relaxing songs like the ending used for the last episode, \"bless,\" etc. Another great thing about it is that the names for the tracks are really strange, which fits the atmosphere of the anime and the song itself really well. The opening really caught my attention and subjectively, I love listening to it - though it definitely may not seem like something everyone may love. The ending is similar in a way, but it also gives the impression that the other songs and tracks gave - strangeness, and uniqueness.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters --------- 22/25 ---------\\n\r\nThis is where things get a bit deep. Since the main character list is kept down at a minimum, you actually get to learn a lot more about each particular person. Considering that this was one arc through 11 episodes, we got to know the characters pretty well - those including The boys, the detective, and the girl, and the white haired girl (Avoiding names for now). We got some decent supporting characters as well, those being the people in the government as an example. I thought that the development could have been a bit deeper, but it was really pleasurable to see all the characters grow and change their feelings throughout the anime. It was also interesting to see the connections they would make with each other when they met.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment --------- 15/15 ---------\\n\r\nI had a great time watching this anime. The second I started watching, I knew that this would be a great trip, and I know that you will be feeling that as well. The scenarios were really well done here, and the trivia that you can learn from this anime is very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: I highly recommend this anime to you because of its originality, music, art style, and wonderful characters - and bombs of course!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 93/100",

            "content": "Zankyou no Terror is about a duo of terrorists who are called Sphinx.  They are terrorist and such they blow stuff if their riddles aren\u2019t solved but while watching this show they didn\u2019t even killed anyone.  \r\nYet they are terrorist. And the question here as I watch the anime, why are they doing this? What is there goal?  Let\u2019s take a closer look in this anime.\r\nThe story of this anime is simple. Its about a duo of terrorist who tells riddles but if not solved then KABOOM!!!  Since Watanabe is the director who directed Cowboy Bebop I had high expectations. AndWatanabe didn\u2019t fail me. The execution of the plot of the anime is almost entirely flawless. With the blend of OSTs in the scenes, the story itself becomes more like psychological and thriller. The mood of the story is angry and it ended well according to the mood. But there are many questions raised in the story. What is Sphinx? Why is Lisa so useless? Why Sphinx is doing all this things?  As I watch this anime, I felt the anime is becoming a riddle itself.  \\n\\n\r\nThe most intriguing thing in this anime is the characters. 9 and 12 are well-made characters. They convey emotions and has a big background and development. 9 and 12 form the duo of Sphinx and since they tell riddles, they become the actual embodiment of a Sphinx like in the myth. So if there is a Sphinx then there must be a Oedipus. The Oedipus in this show is none other than Shibazaki, a detective. Shibazaki is my favourite character in this show, he done his role on the show excellently. Lisa is perhaps the most useless character others say but in reality her uselessness makes her complete as a character. Her role and actions in the story as a useless character made a great impact in the closing episodes. Lisa\u2019s uselessness symbolizes Sphinx\u2019s weaknesses because her actions made Sphinx a little vulnerable. Five, in my opinion, is the worst character. Her character has not much background and dimension. Her final acts proved that. But her presence made a great impact in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe OSTs of the show is simply undeniably amazing. Yoko Kanno has surpassed my expectations. OSTs were played in the transcendental peaks of the show which makes me awe.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, ZnK is one of the best this year. Its animation is entirely flawless. The visuals and artwork are amazing. The story makes its use of its gloomy setting. It has realistic character designs (unlike Yu-Gi-OH) The animation among the best, anime has to offer. It has fluid movement even in the background that is not degrading. Its very detailed.\\n\\n\r\nZankyou no Terror is a solid 11-episode anime not perfect but its great. Although the anime has shortcomings but the peaks of the very anime justifies the shortcomings. Watanabe made another awesome anime, not his best work, but its better than most animes with the same genre\\n\r\n8.9/10\\n\r\nComment your opinion about my review ^_^\\n",

            "content": "While not exactly about terrorism, Zankyou no Terror has an artistically brilliantly story line. The calming music clashes with the tense nature of the anime in a beautiful sophisticated way. I actually studied the soundtrack before watching the show, as it came up in a music analysis class i take, so my opinion may be a tad biased. However, it is some of the most poetic piano music you can find in an anime. \r\nThe animation wasn't lacking but was nothing special. The character development sadly was lacking. While the characters were indeed unique, you don't really find out that much about the mainduo. They lack depth and you never truly get a sense of who they are. They also don't really get the chance to grow as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was unique and well-balanced. The plot was well constructed and thought out, including twists when least expected and an appropriate usage of flashbacks. This story is distinct, complex and extremely compelling and was by far the selling point of the anime.",
