            "content": "I am a total ecchi-enthusiast, so keep in mind I might be a little in love with this show when writing my review. \r\nStory: 10\r\nHaha. Most people would probably shrug this show off as \"Are you serious?\" or \"Wow, what perverts\", as the synapsis makes it seem like Yamada is a total slut and that all you'll get is very intense fanservice for 12 episodes. Think KissxSis or Rosario+Vampire-esque. But B Gata H Kei is not purely fanservice, there is actually a very funny story, and when there is fanservice it's not that trashy, are-you-kidding-me kind. A girl who thinks her vagina looks weird andwants 100 sex friends? Sounds good to me. But there is so much more to B Gata H Kei. A girl's quest to have sex filled with hilarious dialogue and outrageous situations. Ecchi comedy at its finest.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good. Yamada and others are well drawn and cute and backgrounds and scenery (like Kanejou's house) can be very pretty. Kosuda definitely fits the generic high school male description, and this is very refreshing in contrast to the majority of \"normal\" anime males with six packs, spikey blonde hair, etc. Boobs can be a bit huge in this show, but it's not disgusting and trashy because of B Gata H Kei's comedic element.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe show has a decent amount of popular seiyuu including Tamura Yukari and Horie Yui as Yamada and Takeshita, respectively, so sound is nice and the voice acting isn't forced and unbelievable or anything. The OP and ED are cute to me, and will probably be cute to you too if you're a Yukarin fan :). The background music isn't made up of mellifluous symphonies or anything TENMON-esque, but it gets the job done and isn't annoying or anything. The random \"B Gata H Kei~\" is cute. ^^\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nYAMADA. I love Yamada so much, she'd get a 10/10 from me. Yamada is so entertaining, and her sorta tsuntsun side, though cliche, can make episodes very funny. The best part about Yamada is that she's daring, as you'll see if you watch the show. And let's face it, it's not often that you have a sex-obsessed female character in anime.\\n\r\nKosuda can also have his awesome moments, though he usually fits the typical high school male role that he's supposed to fit (which is a good thing). Other characters like Takeshita, Kanejou, and Miyano often add to the comedic relief of the show and are valuable aspects to this show's comedy. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: >9000\\n\r\nI wish I could give this show an infinity in enjoyment, because that's what really makes this show a 10/10, the only 10/10 I've ever given, for me. I remember watching every episode of this show and not wanting it to end. This show is hilarious and I enjoyed it to the fullest extent. Today, 6/18/10, I finished the series and I sort of wanted to cry, because there'd be no more of this show to entertain me on a weekly basis. ): The comedy in this show is amazing, though it can still manage to be serious and/or erotic. \\n\\n\r\nB Gata H Kei is an amazing watch if you just want to enjoy yourself and don't mind a little ecchi. If you're an ecchi-enthusiast like I am, I highly recommend this show, as it is probably the best, and seriously the classiest ecchi I've ever seen. I know classy ecchi sounds a little bit strange, but I promise you, this is not a Rosario + Vampire kind of ecchi with panty shots galore, but the fanservice is there where it's supposed to be, the comedy balances it out so it's not gratuitous. \\n\\n\r\nIf you love ecchi and comedy, you'll surely love B Gata H Kei~!",

            "content": "\"At this rate, you'll never get laid!\"\r\nOh my Lord. Where to start with this anime... I was just browsing through My Anime List, just adding new animes to my \"Summer Watch List\", and stumbled upon this. Added it to the list, 2 weeks later, a friend of mine told me that he had watched this and told me he liked it a lot. So, this was the first anime I watched over the entire summer with the exception of Attack on Titan and Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicals. My first impression, \"What the f*ck did I just watch...?\" For those of you who have seen it aswell, you were all thinking the same thing, I know you did. It's one of those romcoms for adults, similar to Seitokai Yakuindomo, only this show focuses on one thing, Sex. Without further ado, let's get this review started, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nB Gata H Kei, has a unique story, if you can actually call it that. It focuses on our main protagonist, Yamada. She's the most beautiful girl at her school, all the guys can't help but fall for her. Her goal is to have 100 Friends with Benefits, or Sex Buddies as she calls it. Strange, huh? 15 years old and the only thing she can think of is sex. For a teenage boy, yes, I can imagine that, but you'd never guess that's all a girl would think about that stuff. Anyways, she wants her first time to be with a cherry boy (AKA a virgin). She happens to find a boy by the name of Kosuda, an obvious cherry boy judging from the way he acts around her. Later, she finds out he goes to her school. And he sits right next to her. Throughout the show, Yamada tries to get Kosuda to have sex with her, however he can be dense at times, and not even know what she's trying to do, and you'd think flashing him would give him some kind of clue... as the story starts progressing, there are other characters that come into the show, giving them something else to present to the audience, so as an overall story, in terms of uniqueness, it's grade A. In terms of having an actual story, it's grade Lucky Star.\\n\\n\r\nB Gata H Kei was brought to you by the studio who produced/co-produced animes such as Aria, DearS, Boys Be..., and Kaleido Star. For their previous animes, the art style is actually fairly well done in my opinion. The characters are pretty casual in terms of uniqueness, but they are drawn with such precision and detail that I really liked it. The only problem I had was all the sparkles around the Kanejou Siblings... what the hell are they, Vampires? What, are they related to the cast of Twilight?\\n\\n\r\nI watched both the English Dub and Sub version of B Gata H Kei. Overall, I prefer the sub. I won't lie, I'm Brittney Karbowski's biggest fan ever. No joke, but she didn't suit the role of Yamada. In my opinion, Yamada is a littttle bit... of a bitch. That is not something Brittney is good at. Actually, she did a really good job as Yamada, but I hated hearing such a beautiful actress play the role of a skank. It was sad. The other voice actors and actresses I had no problems with, I loved Alexis Tipton as Yamada's Sex Deity, and Greg Aryes as Kosuda's Sex Deity, and Cherami Leigh as Miharu. Those were my favorite characters. Everyone in the Japanese Dub did an awesome job though, they matched up to their characters with perfection and professionalism.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not often that the character I hate most in an anime is the main character, I think the only other protagonist I hated was Shinji from Neon Genesis Evangelion... but come on, we all hated him. But I couldn't stand Yamada. I think it was a mixture of her slut-like personality and her overall meanness that made he hate her so much... sure she was pretty in some scenes, but whenever she opened her mouth, I instantly knew something about sex was gonna come out. Kosuda was actually the one person in B Gata H Kei that I could relate to in some way. He's super shy around girls, he doesn't understand them that much, but he's an overall nice guy. I have most of the same problems as him, so I liked him a lot. I knew what he was feeling and stuff. Next are the Deities. Yamada's Deity was hilarious, her comments and scene change lines were all awesome. Kosuda's Deity didn't have many moments in the show, except whenever Kosuda would get a little excited (if you know what I mean). He was more of a censorship then a character... and then we have Miharu, Yamada's best friend. She is somehow able to handle being friends with Yamada, which I don't know how, but she gives advice and can be a good friend a lot of the time. And lastly... Kyoka, or should I say Miss Vampire Queen. She's gorgeous, but she has the same personality as Yamada, only sex isn't the only thing she ever thinks about... also she sparkles 24/7.\\n\\n\r\nI had no idea what I was getting myself into when I started B Gata H Kei, but I can say that it was a fun watch. It had a lot of good humor in it, similar to Seitokai Yakuindomo like I said before, and I enjoyed the crap out of that one. It had romance throughout the entire show, but it was more of a requited love sadly. The ending came a little too sudden, I feel like this could have been a 24 episode anime if they decided to, but overall it was a good anime. I recommend it to those who love echii, but if you hate sexual jokes and innuendos, by all means, don't watch this. If you don't mind that, this is a must watch.",

            "content": "Normally I stay very, VERY clear from ecchi-type anime. I cannot stand harem shit, I can't do the gross sexism and fanservice grossness, and I really don't have the patience to sit through hours upon hours of \"will they? won't they? lol of course not.\" When a good friend of mine recommended it to me I was extremely skeptical, but once I started the first episode I was immediately hooked. \r\nThe main character is practically a carbon copy of myself at 15 - so incredibly interested in having sex, but equally awkward about actually making it happen. I related to her so much, and Ireally believe this is because the author is a (talented) woman; she is really able to get into the hormone-addled mind of a curious but inexperienced teenage girl. I found myself cheering her on from the very beginning and was actually holding my breath when things got interesting. The other characters are cute and just about everyone gets a good amount of actual development, which is not what I was expecting from a show like this. \\n\\n\r\nOther than the premise and characters though, a lot of aspects fell short. The music was forgettable, the animation was pretty standard, etc. The humor was just a bit repetitive, but surprisingly did get a few out-loud laughs from me. The ending was a disappointment, since there was no real \"conclusion\" to speak of - I had to turn to the manga (starting around chapter 260) for closure. \\n\\n\r\nI watched the English dub, and the voice acting was pretty good! Normally I stick pretty exclusively to subs, but having watched parts of this both ways, I can pretty safely say that the jokes translated much better when used with American slang. \\n\\n\r\nYamada and her little sex goddess character really what made this show special, though. I wasn't expecting to connect so much with her or to root for a character every step of the way, so I was very pleasantly surprised to see a female lead who was just as outspoken about sex as I was at her age. Although I may not rewatch this, if any additional content is made, I will be very eager to see it!",

I can't really relate to that since I don't have the luck that Takashi Kosuda has in this series.\r\n   Honestly, only watch this if you have a sense of perversion because the entire thing is literally all about sex, but thats whats nice about it. I would love to enjoy this anime after seeing something heartbreaking like Clannad and its after story.\r\n   The whole I want to have 100 \"partners\"in my lifetime makes you think its a hentai, but in actuality its just a innocent anime about high school kids discovering about sex. I believe every high school kid has dreamed about the day where they finally get to discover another person's body. Don't get me wrong, there are certainly fan service elements in this but I feel that this is a worthy anime for a season 2 or perhaps an OVA.\\n\\n\r\n  This anime is amazingly cheery and fun. You will never get sad since its an optimistic anime filled with jokes, (that aren't outdated) even if half of them have something sex related to it. \\n\\n\r\n What I didn't like about this anime is that how undetailed the supporting characters were and that its censored. I also did not like how short it was (and that it was censored.) I feel that another season is a must for B Gata H Kei but this time with improvements. I want them to go in depth with their story line (and did I mention how it was censored?)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd give this a 7, its not a MUST see but you'd be happy if you did.\\n\\n\r\nPS. ANOTHER SEASON WOULD BE AMAZING. did i mention the censoring?",

            "content": "If there is any show that defines wasted potential, it\u2019s B Gata H Kei. What started as a possible lighthearted gender flipped rendition of School Days ended up a pedestrian school comedy that was only saved by a somewhat fresh sense of humor and constant victimization of the lead and her love interest. \r\nOur story follows Yamada, first name conspicuously absent throughout the whole affair, on her quest to have sex with one hundred males by the end of high school. Everything seems in the bag for her: She\u2019s beautiful, smart; every guy in school wants her. The problem is, she\u2019s too self conscious abouther lady bits to make a move. \\n\\n\r\nSo rather than aiming for somebody with sexual experience, she ends up starting with the lowest rung in class that she can imagine: A random boy she finds in a bookstore who looks as average and virgin-like as possible named Kosuda. And thus starts a series of blunders in a quest to get him to have sex with her, while only paying lip service to her goal stated early on. \\n\\n\r\nHelping her on her way is Yamada\u2019s own Ero-God, a chibi-fied character resembling her in every way that has a swarthy moustache. The problem is, due to Yamada\u2019s impulsive waffling, Ero-God does much more berating than assisting or praising.\\n\\n\r\nOn the way, opposition is offered from Kosuda\u2019s introverted and painfully clumsy childhood friend, and the standard exchange student who wants nothing more than to crush Yamada for besting her in a beauty contest. Romantic hijinks ensue, sex nearly happens more than once, and more than a few bones end up broken as a result of Yamada\u2019s own cluelessness. \\n\\n\r\nFirst, let\u2019s get the good points out of the way. Yamada is the best example of a horny ecchi male lead in a woman\u2019s body. Except rather than taking the Maria Holic route of making her fantasize for half the damn episode, Yamada\u2019s actually proactive enough to seek sex on her own, even if she\u2019s too scared to see it through \u2018til the end. \\n\\n\r\nThat can hardly be faulted against her though, with her endeavoring to screw a hundred guys by the end of her high school career without having even been in a relationship before. The tsundere pretense that she puts up helps to characterize her as somebody who has faith in her attractiveness, but not necessarily her ability to deal with the opposite sex in a lustful way.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I wouldn\u2019t call the comedy exceptionally unique and stellar, it\u2019s well implemented enough to make up for the many faults that plague the series throughout. While Kosuda isn\u2019t anybody with a vibrant personality, he does well in representing sexually frustrated, yet cautious youth. He doesn\u2019t act like he\u2019s above having sex, yet he isn\u2019t fully comfortable with it either, creating a believable sense of awkwardness. Strangely enough, by the end he becomes the most endearing character, putting up with the harmful antics of Yamada much more than would be thought humanly possible.\\n\\n\r\nTogether, the two form the perfect combination: Both have implacable sex drives, no experience in relieving their libidos, and interest in the other that gets muddled amidst the endless moments of miscommunication that occur. It\u2019s surprisingly deep, surprisingly realistic characterization that isn\u2019t common in any media, and that\u2019s a treat in itself. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, even with that praise, I\u2019d hesitate to call this a great, or even a good anime. Picture any sort of environment for your standard dull romantic comedy (Beach, forest, school), and B Gata H Kei goes there. It can be argued that this is subversion, but it stands that Yamada and Kosuda do everything that couples do in these kinds of anime, and many of the same jokes are used, albeit with less focus on the male\u2019s point of view. \\n\\n\r\nEverything that isn\u2019t related to the two main characters is painfully ordinary. The animation is average at best, the soundtrack is mostly the same, and the plot consistently derails itself for the sake of character development. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a bad thing, but it\u2019s all about expectations. I came in expecting a show about a girl who wanted to have sex with a bevy of males by the end of her senior year, not her struggling to woo just one. \\n\\n\r\nIn an unexpected turn of events, a powerful message is brought to light: A satisfying romance can be had without sex early on. The two could only accept each other in a carnal fashion once they were sure that the other would reciprocate in kind, and would give back with feeling. These are two people insecure with themselves, only secure in the knowledge that the other isn\u2019t confident sexually. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end though, it\u2019s only the characters that changed in the school comedy setup, not the actions. The characters went through the motions until the very end, when their feelings were fully realized and ready to be unleashed in a wave of passion. It\u2019s almost frustrating to watch before this, seeing Yamada screw up in her seduction and Kosuda struggle in understanding why she acts like she does.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned missed potential earlier, and B Gata H Kei had it. What could\u2019ve been a decent look into the mind of a sexually aware yet totally clueless girl on a quest to fully realize herself on a primeval level degenerated quickly into what I mentioned above: A typical comedy that\u2019s only saved by the surprisingly interesting and fleshed out, if not terribly original characters.\\n\\n\r\n I understand that this was to appeal to a broader audience, but there\u2019s a demerit if I ever saw one for completely screwing over what could\u2019ve been the intriguing execution of a rare premise.\\n\\n\r\nB Gata H Kei is perfectly fine, and is a hell of a lot more memorable than many similar series out there. Oddly enough, it\u2019s probably one of the more realistic depictions of romance in anime, and just how awkward it really is when communicated improperly. If you can get past the false premise, occasionally boring episode plots and standard\u2026 well, everything else, B Gata H Kei has plenty to offer on a level of greater depth than you\u2019d think. Just don\u2019t expect to be blown away. \\n",

            "content": "There is a sea of ecchi anime with horny and socially awkward male leads. Heck, it is easy to name a dozen from the top of your head, needless to say the ecchi market gets pretty monotonous... But what if a show centered  around a pervert girl instead? Well, that is exactly what B Gata H Kei decides to do. The result is no better than any number of ecchi titles that have the normal pervert male protagonist.\r\nThe show follows Yamada, an extremely attractive and sex obsessed girl, on her quest to get a hundred sex buddies during her time in high school. Theproblem is, despite being obsessed with sex, Yamada is naive when it comes down to the act, and self-continuous because she is a virgin; she is determined to have her first time with a fellow virgin. Enter Takashi Kosuda, an average high school guy, who just so happens to be a virgin. Of course its not going to be easy for Yamada, because Kosuda's a pretty dense fellow... *Sigh* What can be said about this premise; it's pretty dumb. To be fair, it is different (how many other shows can you name that follow a female lead as perverted as Yamada?), but outside of the weird role-reversal, B Gata H Kei does little to distinguish itself from its ecchi brethren.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the plot progresses is typical for this kind of show. Yamada meets Kosuda and does something that sanctimoniously grabs his attention and repels him from her... then it turns out that they are in the same class in school (of course) giving Yamada ample opportunity to seduce/ sexually harass Kotsuda; awkward moments and half-baked attempts to get laid ensue. Really, there is so little to say about the plot execution here, it is just bland, tired, and uninteresting. It doesn't help that the show is by nature, shallow and superficial... there really is no intensive to follow what is happening on screen, it's all sex jokes or some very forced attempts to build a relationship between its two leads.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are a collection of one-off stereotypes, and that's about all. Pretty much every character is doomed to one (or two, if we're lucky) repeating character trait that defines them. Kosuda is a bland and boring as a lead character gets, and spends all his screen time either misinterpreting Yamada's intentions or getting aroused thinking about her. The other characters are just as bad, consisting of Kosuda's childhood friend, who of course has a crush on him; Yamada's much more mature friend, who's only function is to make snark comments; Yamada's rival, who actually wants to lose her virginity to her brother (of course they would include an incest character)... and too many other poorly written characters to even count. Then there is our leading lady Yamada, who isn't a typical female lead, but her character can be summed up in a few of words: she wants to have sex, but is too timid... THAT'S ALL.\\n\\n\r\nTo say that the show has absolutely no redeeming qualities, though, is a lie. Admittedly, the show can be funny. Yamada's sex fantasies aren't always grating and can generate a few laughs every now and then; the same goes for Kosuda's being clueless. There are gags that work, for no other reason than they are silly or awkward. Even with this though, the series comedy can't be completely congratulated because it is used to death; yeah, if you're looking for a variety of humor, you won't find it here, nothing but crass sex jokes and snark comments. The second thing the show has going for it is the sex appeal, and yeah, it manages to that well. The show actually gets away with quite a bit... it is essentially like watching censored porn; while that doesn't sound too appealing, the show pulls it off with some very descriptive dialogue and well placed demon censor bars or other conveniently placed objects. When that's the best thing that can be said about a show, you know your in trouble.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, B Gata H Kei is generally underwhelming. The character designs are generic and forgettable, only appealing if you are in love with anime art style regardless of quality. Allegedly, Yamada is an extremely attractive girl, but honestly she's not better or worse looking than any of the other girls in her school. Backgrounds are stale, with maybe the exception of scenes in love hotels or make-out spots, even then it is nothing to write home about. The only thing that stands out visually are the demon censor bars and barely concealed fan-service. The show is not impressive in the sound department either, if anything it is less memorable. Its not bad but it is the usual pop music that is used all too often in slice-of-life anime. Really, if you don't have voyeuristic tendencies then B Gata H Kei's technical merits will do nothing for you (though it would be odd that you are even watching an ecchi in that case).\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, B Gata H Kei seems like a show that just wants to have fun, but ends up rather repulsive instead. Sure, something like this would never be sophistic or profound, but this hardly passes as cheap entertainment. The characters are as flat and plastic as they come, and the show doesn't even look good. Even if you are simply looking for some raunchy silliness, there are many other ecchi titles that are much more worth your time than this.\\n",

            "content": "I'd like to start off by saying that this show was very unique to me. The main character Yamada reminded me so much of Nana Komatsu from the anime NANA. Hyperactive, sex addict, guy crazy, and has a friend that gives her good advice.\r\nI really liked the energy and excitement of the story, that and the interesting characters are what gave me a \"good\" impression of it. One thing I really did like and really stands out in this show is that it is not completely over the top. Most shows with the genre ecchi, school, and romance really overdo it with the nudity andfan service whenever they can. B.H.K was kind of like screw that nudity and fan service stuff, well give the viewers excitement and drama. The art was pretty decent for it's time, although it's nothing that really stands out. Overall I think this show is very good! and well planned out.",

            "content": "Upon reading the synopsis and seeing \"her dream was to have casual sex with 100 men,\" my mind went blank. I guess my testosterone levels were high at the time because by the time I knew it the whole anime was downloaded on my computer and the first episode was rolling.\r\nB Gata H Kei is a very \"sexually humored\" driven anime, I like it. Although this looks like a fan service anime it wasn't as flashy as say \"Rosario + Vampire\" or \"Ladies vs Butlers\" with up skirt galore every 5 secs. What really made this anime interesting is the different points of view itshows, seeing what each character is thinking really allows you to empathize with the characters and make it even funnier to know what each of them are thinking. The different awkward/extreme/erotic situations Yamada and Kosuda end up in are hilarious. All for the purpose of Yamadas plans to seduce Kosuda. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of the anime suited the anime well. Most of the girls are drawn not to make them perfect but to give them a sense of realism, they all have one of their own special \"features\" (eg big bewbs, slender body, cute face) , however they are not all perfect, which is a beautiful thannggg. Kosuda is presented as your average high school boy and he fits the description very well, hes not a blonde, feminine, perfect bishounen boy but an average looking boy with the build of a MAN.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of the anime was pretty average, the OP and ED weren't anything extraordinary. The voice acting was pretty good, they suited the characters quite well, I especially liked the \"OHOHOHO\" laugh of the rich girl Kanejou, oh Japan and your stereotypes. The random \"B Gata H Kei\" was surprisingly cute and catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is what I liked most about this anime, its hard to find a good horny female lead that actually has a personality. Damn, Yamada was so funny and very daring, she would go to extreme lengths to try to take Kosudas virginity, but somehow always fail. And her interpretation of things, seeing everything in a perverted way for example. Getting an earring as a present and seeing it as a symbol of \"I want to fuck you\" from Kosuda sent me into a state of hysteria of laughter. Kosuda, I really felt his pain when hes gets all confused as to why is this happening to him, man ALL THEM FEELS. I mean its not everyday a hot girl wants to steal your virginity. All through out the anime I was like oh damn if only you knew what she really wanted.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime, it really is a unique romance comedy. I didn't want it to end, but when it did I tried to look for similar anime with no luck. It was like finding a rare gem in the vast ocean, you'll never find another one.\\n\\n\r\nNow I've talked about the humor of this anime to a large extent, but this anime is also very unexpectedly romantic in a way, the intimacy the characters share shows the strong bond between them and really warms your heart to see them interacting. If you enjoy ecchi humor and surprisingly deep romance, I suggest you watch this anime. I don't recommend this to people who hate fan service, and \"dirty humor.\" \\n\\n\r\nBut really who doesn't like sex?",

            "content": "I'll be the first to admit that, somewhere in the back of my head, there's a dirty-minded twelve year old. I'm referring to the part of my brain that silently laughs at sleazy jokes, sexual slurs, and crude double entendres. You could call it immaturity, or just plain stupidity, but there are occasions where I think things of that nature are hilarious, and I'd be willing to bet that many people feel the same way. For various reasons, some good and some bad, some of us suppress the urge to laugh at this type of material\u2014we've found the little guy in our brain, and muzzledhim like a dog. So this type of comedy isn't going to hit the mark for everyone, and I can respect that. But if somewhere in your head that sneaky little bastard is still living, breathing, and laughing when badly written condom commercials come on the television, then you'll probably be able to derive a fair amount of enjoyment from B Gata H Kei.\\n\\n\r\nNormally I'd start a review with a brief description of the show's plot to establish a little context. But in this case, the synopsis offered by MAL is pretty adequate. If you're like me, you'll probably have to read it twice just to make sure your eyes weren't playing tricks on you. Rest assured that your sanity is intact. It really does say \u201cher dream was to have casual sex with 100 men.\u201d So, with that out of the way, let's talk comedy.\\n\\n\r\nIt'd be easy to brush the series off as raunchy and tasteless based on what you've read, and you'd only be half wrong in doing in so; a lot of the comedy in B Gata H Kei consists of jokes about masturbation, condoms, and breasts. Granted, they're presented a little more cleverly than average, and often the jokes work in ways that are wholly unexpected. Many punchlines are reached through a window into the thoughts and fantasies of the characters, and this makes for a welcome mixture of visual and lingual humor that keeps things from getting too stale.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what makes some of the comedy work is the endearing amount of self-awareness that the show seems to possess, and the frequency with which it pokes fun at some of the cliches and cheesier elements of traditional high-school comedies. Sarcastic jabs are made at the overused visual effects in which female characters \u201csparkle\u201d when happy and project a visible black \u201caura\u201d when angry. The same treatment is given to the cliche of having a foreign character appear attractive and classy, with the students frequently chanting \u201cRaised overseas, indeed\u201d in approval of an American-raised classmate. A few of the dimwitted male supporting characters seem to be aware of their own uselessness, and in one scene they comment that they're having fun because they're \u201cgetting more lines than usual.\u201d These elements add a sense of wit and variety to what would otherwise be a show made entirely of shameless sexual humor. Many shows make the fatal mistake of taking themselves too seriously. B Gata H Kei, on the other hand, knows that it's a raunchy romcom, and embraces it.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters appears to have been put together pretty thoughtfully, and most of them add comedic value to the show in one way or another. Yamada herself is a walking joke, a play on the ideal \u201cpure\u201d schoolgirl that is depicted in most high-school shows. Her and the spacy, awkward Kosuda play very well off each other; Yamada projects an outward appearance of confidence and sexuality, but really, she's every bit as bumbling and insecure as her target. Sometimes the show generates humor based on sheer awkwardness as we watch both of them desperately try to figure out the meaning of the gestures made by the other. They both want the same thing, but they're both too thick-headed to do anything but beat around the bush.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the two leads, the supporting roles are also used to good effect. It's a pretty big cast, but a few particular standouts include: Yamada's best friend, Takeshita, who delivers lines in a deadpan manner that's often as funny, if not funnier than, the over-the-top antics of the other characters; Misato, a thin and unattractive female classmate whose sexual frustration and inability to score are the butt of many a joke; Kyoka Kanejou, a rich and beautiful girl who is envious of Yamada and attempts to steal away the clueless Kosuda.\\n\\n\r\nIt might also sound strange to say this, but B Gata H Kei actually does have thematic elements that are worth mentioning. Buried under a mountain of jokes, there's a cute little plot about two teenagers who are growing up just a little too fast, and trying to rush something that shouldn't be rushed. That isn't exactly winning the series any points in the originality department, and I must express a slight disappointment that such an original (and, frankly, just plain weird) idea quickly turns into something so ordinary. But nonetheless, it's nice to see a show where the comedy is formed around storytelling elements. Many comedies completely abandon the concept of \u201cstory\u201d and just try to pour on the laughs, but B Gata H Kei makes no such mistake; most of the comedy is a natural extension of the plot. It's also worth noting that in terms of a \u201crealistic\u201d depiction of the pervasive awkwardness and uncertainty involved in early-teen relationships, B Gata H Kei comes pretty darn close despite the absurdity of its original premises.\\n\\n\r\nIn the sound department, the series checks in at right about average. If you've heard one \u201cmessing around in high school\u201d soundtrack, you've pretty much heard them all. There are upbeat jazz/pop songs meant to accentuate moments of rapid comedic dialogue and cute orchestral tracks for romantic and/or sad moments. The music here isn't a flop, but neither is it particularly memorable. The voice acting, on the other hand, is excellent. The two mains are perfect foils for each other. Yamada's voice is bold and ever-so-slightly masculine, while Kosuda's is generic and submissive. It's easy to see that these voice actors nailed it. Even the supporting cast manages to sound unique.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, B Gata H Kei is, once again, just about average. The character designs are not offensive, but merely as generic as you can get. I'll give them a break on Kosuda, because he's intentionally designed to look as uninteresting as possible, but all of the other characters really do look like they would be pages in a book titled \u201cDrawing High Schoolers on a Budget.\u201d The most frequent setting is the classroom, so there are not a lot of chances to show off the background art, which is reasonably attractive. The animation is mediocre, but whether or not this really matters is a different question, since motion is rarely a part of the comedic styling or plot progression of the series. This is not a great looking show, but the visuals are adequate to get us where we're going.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I'm left with the impression that B Gata H Kei certainly isn't a groundbreaking or incredible series. There are a few missteps and missed opportunities. But if you're looking for something that's lighthearted, cute, funny, and doesn't take itself too seriously, this is a good option\u2014provided you can bear in mind that much of the humor here is shameless and racy, and embrace that fact.",

She finds out he's a classmate and they get closer and far emotionally at the same time but they keep it like a secret and they never show what they feel for each other because Yamada wants Kosuda to make the first step, and Kosuda thinks if he does make the first step he will fu** up the moment and that's a problem to the development of their relationship, they do get closer at the final eps. but it ends in a hope for a 2nd season that will never come.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound\\n\r\nThe art is good, they animated Kosuda to be a generic guy, and the background is very well animated.

            "content": "B Gata H Kei ended up being not quite what I expected.  I would have been perfectly content with the premise as laid out, and yet what I was given was a story sweeter than a lot of other anime set out to create.  The show barely has fanservice beyond the first episode, and when there is nudity at all, it feels like you have trespassed into an intimate moment.  The framing of these scenes becomes deliberately nonsexual, because the point isn't to tease the viewer, but help you empathize with the emotions of protagonist Yamada.\r\nYamada is a type of character Idon't often see allowed to exist in anime.  Reminiscent of Tomoko from Watamote, she is unabashedly an asshole but also deeply vulnerable in a realistic and relatable way.  Her characterization could have been pushed further, there was a lot more room for her to grow, but as it stands, I was happy to once again see a female character portrayed in this type of light.  Adolescence is hard, and I found a lot of common ground with Yamada, even if she simultaneously frustrates me with the way she treats people.  The climactic scene of the series might also be one of my favorites in anime, it is definitely the most well done part of the show.  It felt written and directed full of love and compassion, and was very refreshing after seeing so many characters in so many other series barely get anywhere in their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nI can't really say I disliked all that much about this series, aside from Yamada needing some more character development, and maybe more side character growth as well.  The dub was well localized, so it was funny enough.  I would recommend this series to anyone who likes romance and seeing couples come together- you really shouldn't be disappointed if that is what you're looking for.  As you can see by the other reviews, this show resonated with a lot of people.",

            "content": "Ecchi at its finest.\r\nB Gata H Kei isn't like your typical romance story, or ecchi for that fact. We have a young adolescent, ambitious for sex, otherwise known as the famous Yamada throughout the whole series. The whole story revolves around our heroine attempting to get a rather large amount of \"sex buddies\". Getting there might be quite hard for her, considering she is insecure about the appearance of her vagina. Due to this, she seeks for a male partner, also a virgin, which is where our dear Kosuda comes in.\r\nThese two characters both are two opposites, it isn't mentioned throughout the series, but usviewers could probably determine it. First we've got Yamada, our omniscient sex do-want female. A true beaut amongst her classmates, seeking for intimate relationships. Then there's Kosuda, a young adolescent that endeavors to even understand Yamada.\\n\\n\r\nIn this relationship, Yamada is the dirty one. Makes it more fun, eh? They both deserve a well earned 9.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation for this anime was amazing, though I give it an 8 because I'm not a fan of the big head skinny neck art. It's good, but not exactly my cup of tea. Asides that, everything was made exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was great, as well. The opening and ending are a joy themselves for those who watch the whole episode. The background music played throughout is well fitted, makes the essence more vivid.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy the anime? But of course, the series is far too short to drag, and every episode keeps you wanting more of Yamada. You never know what she has to bring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime a 9.The plot was very original, and it was outstanding.\\n\\n\r\n~A side note, I'm not one who reviews animes a lot, and this is infact my first review. Judgments upon myself.",

            "content": "B Gata H Kei is wrong in all of the right ways. I feel like this kind of series might not attract many girls, but if you are female, it isn't just a show of male fantasy.  I couldn't get enough of it, and found myself wanting more even as the last episode finished. I'm not much a fan of ecchi, but sometimes something will spark my interest and I have to watch it. This series was definitely one of those.\r\nStory: 8. This story is about a high school girl who wants to have sex with one hundred men. That said, a viewer mightthink this series includes a lot of sex when it is mostly about a girl and a guy in high school who want to have sex and have no idea what to do. It's very real to life, and somewhat similar to what I went through in high school. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8. The artwork was good and the facial expressions, hilarious. It didn't have a point where the art lacked like a lot of newer series, and overall, it was pleasant to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7. I give it a seven because, to be honest, some of the voice acting can get a bit on my nerves at times. It's not nearly as bad as some of the series I've seen, but a few of the voices of the minor characters were annoying. It's not a big problem, and the overall sound quality was fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8. The characters were all fairly unique and all of the characters had their own interesting points. The main characters, Yamada and Kosuda were fairly typical teenagers, and I think they're fairly relate-able in this regard.  The minor characters were all interesting as well, and I never felt like the characters were bringing down the story at all. I honestly would very much like spinoffs featuring some of them, because it would be hilarious as well as interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9. I'm a bit of a sadist, so I thoroughly enjoyed watching every installment of Yamada and Kosuda fail at trying to have sex with each other. Personally, I found this series a laugh a minute, and I spent so much time trying not to laugh, especially during the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8. As I said, it's bad in all the right ways. It's distinctly filthy where it needs to be and really shows how awkward talking about sex and having sex for the first time can really be. There's not much I can say without giving spoilers, but from the moment I heard this show's premise, I knew I was going to love it.",

            "content": "This show is a lot more than what it presents to you during it's premiere episode. Sure, it has it's ecchi parts, but I take it more as a more realistic romance than most animes we see. Most romance animes hold kissing as the climax of the entire show, and it is rarely seen that sex or anything beyond that is portrayed. Today we dive into the vulgar, sex-joke filled realm of B Gata H Kei, and see what stood strong and what flopped (lol i dirty).\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nStory: \r\nThe premise is rather simple: Yamada wants to get laid a hundred times but wants to start itoff with a virgin, just like her. The thing is that this premise is completely false to what the show is actually setting off to do. Since Yamada is so inexperienced in sex and all things dirty, she is all but willing to jump in bed with the main male protagonist and resident cherry boy Kosuda. It instead focuses more on the relationship between the two and their various endeavors to get rid of the god-forsaken V-card. Coupled with the fast paced and hilarious(most of the time) comedy, works very well. Let's just say that if you like vulgar, low-brow comedy, you'll get a kick out of this. However,the ending really puts a bad aftertaste in you're mouth. There is so many plot holes that leave you guessing. Absolutely nothing gets accomplished, and this includes the side stories. It's basically a \"Read the Manga\" style ending, which kind of sucks.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIn most cases, I think Yamada would be a character I would outright despise. But since this is an ecchi comedy show, her naivety and overall cowardness brings a lot to the table in terms of comedy. Sure, she can be downright annoying and tsundere at times, but she just fits into the overall theme of the show so well that you can look past a lot of the faults she has. Then we have Kosuda, the similarly shy, but more passive than aggressive love interest. I liked his character mainly because even though Yamada is flirting around this guy like mad, he still has the sense to take it relatively slow, and treat her like more than a walking pair of breasts, which is basically a complete contrast to Yamada. Their relationship is more or less a combination between Japanese and Western romances. There is the lust and want for sex, but then you have the awkwardidity (ya I totally didn't make that word up) to actually do that stuff. It's much more refreshing than anything. Moving on, the supporting cast did what they needed to, but could have had a bit more development in the long run. As weird as it is for me to say this, I want to figure out what the how the weird incest side plot between two characters was going to work out. They added a lot more comedy to the show, and the show already has a lot to begin with. This goes back to the plot hole ending, where a bit more time could've fleshed out the characters to be more likeable in the long run.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nSound and Animation:\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't anything special about these, to be honest. The animation was fair, but their wasn't enough movement to really observe and call it amazing. The art style worked, but felt 2D in places. And of course, the character designs were sexy where they needed to be, but still a little simple. The soundtrack is really quite forgettable, as nothing stood out to me in the slightest. However, I am quite pleased with the voice acting in this particular anime. There were a few missteps in the English dub (Kanajo), as some voices did sound a bit stale, but for the most part, the over-exuberant voices added to the comedy aspect of the show immensely. To end off on a high note, the opening was catchy, and had the best animation in the entire show, so, major plus there. \\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nTo end off, this show is definitely something at least some people would enjoy. The whole show just screams hilarity, whether it be from Yamada's random antics to the deity's spewing of dirty sex jokes. However, the ending was utter crap, and left so many plot holes you could fly a plane through and end up in Japan to yell at the writers about it. Furthermore, although I did like Yamada's character and thought she fit with the show extremely well, I can see how many can see her as a major turn off from her slutty aspect. But lets be honest here, this is an ecchi show, so it's to be expected. The animation and sound are passable, but really are not anything special by any stretch of the imagination.In summary, this show is flawed in many aspects, leaving it with an average score, but for the \"turn you're brain off\" aspect, which in this show is the most important aspect, succeeds with flying colours.  B Gata H Kei is not something to have on the top of you're list, but if you want to turn you're brain off and let you're hormones and funny bone run wild for a while, this is a pretty good recommendation.",

            "content": "This is NOT your typical fan service perverted ecchi.  Indeed, I have never watched an ecchi anime before this one and was drawn to this series because Brittney Karbowski had provided the dubbing.\r\nThe trailer and advertising does not do the show any favours and any anime fan may roll their eyes at such a ridiculous premise of a story.  This would be a mistake.  In reality, this excellent series is a very humourous light-hearted comedy and the true story is that of Yamada's misconception of sex and the 'first-time'.  Her relentless pursuit of the harmless Kosuda as her first partner 'tobreak the seal' sees the development of an unlikely teenage relationship.\\n\\n\r\nYamada is a somewhat typical tsundere character and the English dubbing does her complete justice.  I was so impressed with the humour, I actually read the rest of the manga and was further impressed with the quality of the story after the anime ends.  It certainly whets your appetite and I hope they do a second series.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual nudity in the series is occasional and appropriate to the setting.  It would equally fit in well with a drama or romance anime and, as mentioned, is atypical of an 'ecchi' anime.  I would go so far as to say this really should be reclassified as a romantic-comedy.\\n\\n\r\nDon't be put be off by the idea that this is an 'ecchi' and of the theme of Yamada's goals - the real story is something much more than this and will have you in stitches.",

Well my friends, this anime not only depicts these moments, but takes it to a whole other level. For an ecchi anime to portray such misgivings of youth, well... They did a kick-ass job!\r\nStory - 10:\r\nFirst off, the introduction of the storyline is something that I, nor I think anybody in the real world would ever be able to see; at least in a rational one.  100 sex friends?Well that got my attention.  \\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is original at least to a point: girl wants some; girl finds  guy, girl falls in love, the end.  But of course along the way, she encounters many \"obstacles\".  Don't want to give anymore spoilers.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9:\\n\\n\r\nThe art was crisp and vibrant.  There was no need for any \"real world\" effects here, just crazy scenes with the typical anime emoticons you find in a lot of comedy-style animes.  Although... Some of the girls have disproportionately large ta-ta's for their heights (not too mention age -  though sometimes that happens in real life too).  But hey  an ecchi anime almost always requires those right?i  Boin away!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8:\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are very cutesy, and definitely lively.  It's so fitting for the main character's personality.   It has a moe feel, but you will know that feeling arises after watching at least one episode\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10:\\n\\n\r\nThis is where anime shines the most.  The Main character Yamada isn't your normal school girl, and by \"normal\" I mean that in psychological terms.  She has that tsundere-like feel sometimes, but most of the time, she would do nothing but think about what most guys think about their whole life: sex. That itself is an original; not to mention a shock in our society.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main character Takashi is that of an awkward boy just trying to survive high school, who happens to get the nickname \"cherry boy\" when he meets Yamada for the first time.  By awkward, I mean trip on a peanut awkward.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters we have the un-datable girl, the little spoiled (and kiss x sis-like) princess,  the shy childhood lady friend, and of course the rational friend. An almost complete set\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - >10:\\n\\n\r\nYes, it was that great.  I looked forward to every episode because I know I have to order new lungs because I would laugh so hard.  Not only that, some of the scenarios are what typical teenagers face, which prompted me in flashbacks; these then would cause me to either laugh more, or scream like a little girl.  Yes, it invoked many voices out of me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9.5:\\n\\n\r\nHaving no decimal point system, I will break the law of round out by giving it a 9 on the official board.  The whole series was funny, ecchi, and sometimes even reminded me of some awkward situations. the 0.5 lost was for some of the slow episodes which I really did not expect.\\n\\n\\n\r\nYou want ecchi, it's got plenty, you want high school, they got it also. You want a horny girl, it's got it.  This is one of the most entertaining animes I've watched for 2010.",

            "content": "After reading the many glowing review of B Gata H Kei, I feel like I watched a completely different show. It's a very watchable but very unlikeable anime.\r\nIt begins well enough with Yamada wanting to lose her virginity so she can work toward her highest goal of having 100 fuck buddies. The best person to lose her virginity to, she decides, is Kosuda, another virgin. Yamada makes a few bold actions toward Kosuda but she never follows through or explains herself. Kosuda is not an idiot, he's just completely bewildered by this deranged girl. This is where the series falls apart.\r\nYamada will make advances towardKosuda only to push him away or yell at him. She's the main character and after only a couple of episodes, you're completely against her. After the pair walk home in the rain, you think that she will begin to develop real feelings for Kosuda, but instead she becomes more rude toward him. It doesn't matter that Yamada's actions are due to her being scared of actually having sex; she comes across as an unlikeable lunatic.\\n\\n\r\nEventually a villain of sorts is introduced - the beautiful and popular Kanejou. She plots to find, steal, and dump Yamada's boyfriend. Also introduced is Kosuda's childhood friend - a girl named Mayu who actually likes and wants to be with Kosuda. These are the characters you should be cheering on. Unfortunately, their stories ultimately go nowhere while Yamada and Kosuda build up to a disappointing ending. Yamada almost has a redemption in the last couple of episodes, but it's difficult to see if she really changed or not.",

A loyal friend indeed.\\n\\n\r\nHakuro: Yamada might want to get a HIV check when she's 30 if that happens\\n\\n\r\nWell that WAS her goal. Until she found a suitable prey.\\n\r\nIntroducing the main man of this anime. Takashi Kosuda!. Your normal, average, ordinary 15 year old boy. Being hunted down by the predator Yamada. Like I said, ordinary. Nothing special except his \"cherry status\" (chastity) that Yamada is after.\\n\\n\r\nWhy Yes?\\n\r\nThe \"run-in to the boy you met before in school the next day kind of starting\" with a twist. Well there are classic scenes with underwear showing accidentally. But other than that. Nothing.\\n\\n\r\nI'm done with the characters side. All in all this anime is hilariously funny.\\n\\n\r\nArt: As an aspiring mangaka I have to say the art is pretty cute. And the background and scenery is very detailed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Average. Nothing much but adds a serious funny effect when it comes to the funny parts. LOL\\n\\n\r\nHai~sankyuu for taking your time to read my review. Don't kill me, its my 2nd time and this is for old-times sake since its ending soon. (:\\n\\n",

            "content": "I am a total ecchi-enthusiast, so keep in mind I might be a little in love with this show when writing my review. \r\nStory: 10\r\nHaha. Most people would probably shrug this show off as \"Are you serious?\" or \"Wow, what perverts\", as the synapsis makes it seem like Yamada is a total slut and that all you'll get is very intense fanservice for 12 episodes. Think KissxSis or Rosario+Vampire-esque. But B Gata H Kei is not purely fanservice, there is actually a very funny story, and when there is fanservice it's not that trashy, are-you-kidding-me kind. A girl who thinks her vagina looks weird andwants 100 sex friends? Sounds good to me. But there is so much more to B Gata H Kei. A girl's quest to have sex filled with hilarious dialogue and outrageous situations. Ecchi comedy at its finest.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good. Yamada and others are well drawn and cute and backgrounds and scenery (like Kanejou's house) can be very pretty. Kosuda definitely fits the generic high school male description, and this is very refreshing in contrast to the majority of \"normal\" anime males with six packs, spikey blonde hair, etc. Boobs can be a bit huge in this show, but it's not disgusting and trashy because of B Gata H Kei's comedic element.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe show has a decent amount of popular seiyuu including Tamura Yukari and Horie Yui as Yamada and Takeshita, respectively, so sound is nice and the voice acting isn't forced and unbelievable or anything. The OP and ED are cute to me, and will probably be cute to you too if you're a Yukarin fan :). The background music isn't made up of mellifluous symphonies or anything TENMON-esque, but it gets the job done and isn't annoying or anything. The random \"B Gata H Kei~\" is cute. ^^\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nYAMADA. I love Yamada so much, she'd get a 10/10 from me. Yamada is so entertaining, and her sorta tsuntsun side, though cliche, can make episodes very funny. The best part about Yamada is that she's daring, as you'll see if you watch the show. And let's face it, it's not often that you have a sex-obsessed female character in anime.\\n\r\nKosuda can also have his awesome moments, though he usually fits the typical high school male role that he's supposed to fit (which is a good thing). Other characters like Takeshita, Kanejou, and Miyano often add to the comedic relief of the show and are valuable aspects to this show's comedy. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: >9000\\n\r\nI wish I could give this show an infinity in enjoyment, because that's what really makes this show a 10/10, the only 10/10 I've ever given, for me. I remember watching every episode of this show and not wanting it to end. This show is hilarious and I enjoyed it to the fullest extent. Today, 6/18/10, I finished the series and I sort of wanted to cry, because there'd be no more of this show to entertain me on a weekly basis. ): The comedy in this show is amazing, though it can still manage to be serious and/or erotic. \\n\\n\r\nB Gata H Kei is an amazing watch if you just want to enjoy yourself and don't mind a little ecchi. If you're an ecchi-enthusiast like I am, I highly recommend this show, as it is probably the best, and seriously the classiest ecchi I've ever seen. I know classy ecchi sounds a little bit strange, but I promise you, this is not a Rosario + Vampire kind of ecchi with panty shots galore, but the fanservice is there where it's supposed to be, the comedy balances it out so it's not gratuitous. \\n\\n\r\nIf you love ecchi and comedy, you'll surely love B Gata H Kei~!",

            "content": "\"At this rate, you'll never get laid!\"\r\nOh my Lord. Where to start with this anime... I was just browsing through My Anime List, just adding new animes to my \"Summer Watch List\", and stumbled upon this. Added it to the list, 2 weeks later, a friend of mine told me that he had watched this and told me he liked it a lot. So, this was the first anime I watched over the entire summer with the exception of Attack on Titan and Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicals. My first impression, \"What the f*ck did I just watch...?\" For those of you who have seen it aswell, you were all thinking the same thing, I know you did. It's one of those romcoms for adults, similar to Seitokai Yakuindomo, only this show focuses on one thing, Sex. Without further ado, let's get this review started, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nB Gata H Kei, has a unique story, if you can actually call it that. It focuses on our main protagonist, Yamada. She's the most beautiful girl at her school, all the guys can't help but fall for her. Her goal is to have 100 Friends with Benefits, or Sex Buddies as she calls it. Strange, huh? 15 years old and the only thing she can think of is sex. For a teenage boy, yes, I can imagine that, but you'd never guess that's all a girl would think about that stuff. Anyways, she wants her first time to be with a cherry boy (AKA a virgin). She happens to find a boy by the name of Kosuda, an obvious cherry boy judging from the way he acts around her. Later, she finds out he goes to her school. And he sits right next to her. Throughout the show, Yamada tries to get Kosuda to have sex with her, however he can be dense at times, and not even know what she's trying to do, and you'd think flashing him would give him some kind of clue... as the story starts progressing, there are other characters that come into the show, giving them something else to present to the audience, so as an overall story, in terms of uniqueness, it's grade A. In terms of having an actual story, it's grade Lucky Star.\\n\\n\r\nB Gata H Kei was brought to you by the studio who produced/co-produced animes such as Aria, DearS, Boys Be..., and Kaleido Star. For their previous animes, the art style is actually fairly well done in my opinion. The characters are pretty casual in terms of uniqueness, but they are drawn with such precision and detail that I really liked it. The only problem I had was all the sparkles around the Kanejou Siblings... what the hell are they, Vampires? What, are they related to the cast of Twilight?\\n\\n\r\nI watched both the English Dub and Sub version of B Gata H Kei. Overall, I prefer the sub. I won't lie, I'm Brittney Karbowski's biggest fan ever. No joke, but she didn't suit the role of Yamada. In my opinion, Yamada is a littttle bit... of a bitch. That is not something Brittney is good at. Actually, she did a really good job as Yamada, but I hated hearing such a beautiful actress play the role of a skank. It was sad. The other voice actors and actresses I had no problems with, I loved Alexis Tipton as Yamada's Sex Deity, and Greg Aryes as Kosuda's Sex Deity, and Cherami Leigh as Miharu. Those were my favorite characters. Everyone in the Japanese Dub did an awesome job though, they matched up to their characters with perfection and professionalism.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not often that the character I hate most in an anime is the main character, I think the only other protagonist I hated was Shinji from Neon Genesis Evangelion... but come on, we all hated him. But I couldn't stand Yamada. I think it was a mixture of her slut-like personality and her overall meanness that made he hate her so much... sure she was pretty in some scenes, but whenever she opened her mouth, I instantly knew something about sex was gonna come out. Kosuda was actually the one person in B Gata H Kei that I could relate to in some way. He's super shy around girls, he doesn't understand them that much, but he's an overall nice guy. I have most of the same problems as him, so I liked him a lot. I knew what he was feeling and stuff. Next are the Deities. Yamada's Deity was hilarious, her comments and scene change lines were all awesome. Kosuda's Deity didn't have many moments in the show, except whenever Kosuda would get a little excited (if you know what I mean). He was more of a censorship then a character... and then we have Miharu, Yamada's best friend. She is somehow able to handle being friends with Yamada, which I don't know how, but she gives advice and can be a good friend a lot of the time. And lastly... Kyoka, or should I say Miss Vampire Queen. She's gorgeous, but she has the same personality as Yamada, only sex isn't the only thing she ever thinks about... also she sparkles 24/7.\\n\\n\r\nI had no idea what I was getting myself into when I started B Gata H Kei, but I can say that it was a fun watch. It had a lot of good humor in it, similar to Seitokai Yakuindomo like I said before, and I enjoyed the crap out of that one. It had romance throughout the entire show, but it was more of a requited love sadly. The ending came a little too sudden, I feel like this could have been a 24 episode anime if they decided to, but overall it was a good anime. I recommend it to those who love echii, but if you hate sexual jokes and innuendos, by all means, don't watch this. If you don't mind that, this is a must watch.",

            "content": "Normally I stay very, VERY clear from ecchi-type anime. I cannot stand harem shit, I can't do the gross sexism and fanservice grossness, and I really don't have the patience to sit through hours upon hours of \"will they? won't they? lol of course not.\" When a good friend of mine recommended it to me I was extremely skeptical, but once I started the first episode I was immediately hooked. \r\nThe main character is practically a carbon copy of myself at 15 - so incredibly interested in having sex, but equally awkward about actually making it happen. I related to her so much, and Ireally believe this is because the author is a (talented) woman; she is really able to get into the hormone-addled mind of a curious but inexperienced teenage girl. I found myself cheering her on from the very beginning and was actually holding my breath when things got interesting. The other characters are cute and just about everyone gets a good amount of actual development, which is not what I was expecting from a show like this. \\n\\n\r\nOther than the premise and characters though, a lot of aspects fell short. The music was forgettable, the animation was pretty standard, etc. The humor was just a bit repetitive, but surprisingly did get a few out-loud laughs from me. The ending was a disappointment, since there was no real \"conclusion\" to speak of - I had to turn to the manga (starting around chapter 260) for closure. \\n\\n\r\nI watched the English dub, and the voice acting was pretty good! Normally I stick pretty exclusively to subs, but having watched parts of this both ways, I can pretty safely say that the jokes translated much better when used with American slang. \\n\\n\r\nYamada and her little sex goddess character really what made this show special, though. I wasn't expecting to connect so much with her or to root for a character every step of the way, so I was very pleasantly surprised to see a female lead who was just as outspoken about sex as I was at her age. Although I may not rewatch this, if any additional content is made, I will be very eager to see it!",

I can't really relate to that since I don't have the luck that Takashi Kosuda has in this series.\r\n   Honestly, only watch this if you have a sense of perversion because the entire thing is literally all about sex, but thats whats nice about it. I would love to enjoy this anime after seeing something heartbreaking like Clannad and its after story.\r\n   The whole I want to have 100 \"partners\"in my lifetime makes you think its a hentai, but in actuality its just a innocent anime about high school kids discovering about sex. I believe every high school kid has dreamed about the day where they finally get to discover another person's body. Don't get me wrong, there are certainly fan service elements in this but I feel that this is a worthy anime for a season 2 or perhaps an OVA.\\n\\n\r\n  This anime is amazingly cheery and fun. You will never get sad since its an optimistic anime filled with jokes, (that aren't outdated) even if half of them have something sex related to it. \\n\\n\r\n What I didn't like about this anime is that how undetailed the supporting characters were and that its censored. I also did not like how short it was (and that it was censored.) I feel that another season is a must for B Gata H Kei but this time with improvements. I want them to go in depth with their story line (and did I mention how it was censored?)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd give this a 7, its not a MUST see but you'd be happy if you did.\\n\\n\r\nPS. ANOTHER SEASON WOULD BE AMAZING. did i mention the censoring?",

            "content": "If there is any show that defines wasted potential, it\u2019s B Gata H Kei. What started as a possible lighthearted gender flipped rendition of School Days ended up a pedestrian school comedy that was only saved by a somewhat fresh sense of humor and constant victimization of the lead and her love interest. \r\nOur story follows Yamada, first name conspicuously absent throughout the whole affair, on her quest to have sex with one hundred males by the end of high school. Everything seems in the bag for her: She\u2019s beautiful, smart; every guy in school wants her. The problem is, she\u2019s too self conscious abouther lady bits to make a move. \\n\\n\r\nSo rather than aiming for somebody with sexual experience, she ends up starting with the lowest rung in class that she can imagine: A random boy she finds in a bookstore who looks as average and virgin-like as possible named Kosuda. And thus starts a series of blunders in a quest to get him to have sex with her, while only paying lip service to her goal stated early on. \\n\\n\r\nHelping her on her way is Yamada\u2019s own Ero-God, a chibi-fied character resembling her in every way that has a swarthy moustache. The problem is, due to Yamada\u2019s impulsive waffling, Ero-God does much more berating than assisting or praising.\\n\\n\r\nOn the way, opposition is offered from Kosuda\u2019s introverted and painfully clumsy childhood friend, and the standard exchange student who wants nothing more than to crush Yamada for besting her in a beauty contest. Romantic hijinks ensue, sex nearly happens more than once, and more than a few bones end up broken as a result of Yamada\u2019s own cluelessness. \\n\\n\r\nFirst, let\u2019s get the good points out of the way. Yamada is the best example of a horny ecchi male lead in a woman\u2019s body. Except rather than taking the Maria Holic route of making her fantasize for half the damn episode, Yamada\u2019s actually proactive enough to seek sex on her own, even if she\u2019s too scared to see it through \u2018til the end. \\n\\n\r\nThat can hardly be faulted against her though, with her endeavoring to screw a hundred guys by the end of her high school career without having even been in a relationship before. The tsundere pretense that she puts up helps to characterize her as somebody who has faith in her attractiveness, but not necessarily her ability to deal with the opposite sex in a lustful way.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I wouldn\u2019t call the comedy exceptionally unique and stellar, it\u2019s well implemented enough to make up for the many faults that plague the series throughout. While Kosuda isn\u2019t anybody with a vibrant personality, he does well in representing sexually frustrated, yet cautious youth. He doesn\u2019t act like he\u2019s above having sex, yet he isn\u2019t fully comfortable with it either, creating a believable sense of awkwardness. Strangely enough, by the end he becomes the most endearing character, putting up with the harmful antics of Yamada much more than would be thought humanly possible.\\n\\n\r\nTogether, the two form the perfect combination: Both have implacable sex drives, no experience in relieving their libidos, and interest in the other that gets muddled amidst the endless moments of miscommunication that occur. It\u2019s surprisingly deep, surprisingly realistic characterization that isn\u2019t common in any media, and that\u2019s a treat in itself. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, even with that praise, I\u2019d hesitate to call this a great, or even a good anime. Picture any sort of environment for your standard dull romantic comedy (Beach, forest, school), and B Gata H Kei goes there. It can be argued that this is subversion, but it stands that Yamada and Kosuda do everything that couples do in these kinds of anime, and many of the same jokes are used, albeit with less focus on the male\u2019s point of view. \\n\\n\r\nEverything that isn\u2019t related to the two main characters is painfully ordinary. The animation is average at best, the soundtrack is mostly the same, and the plot consistently derails itself for the sake of character development. I wouldn\u2019t say this is a bad thing, but it\u2019s all about expectations. I came in expecting a show about a girl who wanted to have sex with a bevy of males by the end of her senior year, not her struggling to woo just one. \\n\\n\r\nIn an unexpected turn of events, a powerful message is brought to light: A satisfying romance can be had without sex early on. The two could only accept each other in a carnal fashion once they were sure that the other would reciprocate in kind, and would give back with feeling. These are two people insecure with themselves, only secure in the knowledge that the other isn\u2019t confident sexually. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end though, it\u2019s only the characters that changed in the school comedy setup, not the actions. The characters went through the motions until the very end, when their feelings were fully realized and ready to be unleashed in a wave of passion. It\u2019s almost frustrating to watch before this, seeing Yamada screw up in her seduction and Kosuda struggle in understanding why she acts like she does.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned missed potential earlier, and B Gata H Kei had it. What could\u2019ve been a decent look into the mind of a sexually aware yet totally clueless girl on a quest to fully realize herself on a primeval level degenerated quickly into what I mentioned above: A typical comedy that\u2019s only saved by the surprisingly interesting and fleshed out, if not terribly original characters.\\n\\n\r\n I understand that this was to appeal to a broader audience, but there\u2019s a demerit if I ever saw one for completely screwing over what could\u2019ve been the intriguing execution of a rare premise.\\n\\n\r\nB Gata H Kei is perfectly fine, and is a hell of a lot more memorable than many similar series out there. Oddly enough, it\u2019s probably one of the more realistic depictions of romance in anime, and just how awkward it really is when communicated improperly. If you can get past the false premise, occasionally boring episode plots and standard\u2026 well, everything else, B Gata H Kei has plenty to offer on a level of greater depth than you\u2019d think. Just don\u2019t expect to be blown away. \\n",

            "content": "There is a sea of ecchi anime with horny and socially awkward male leads. Heck, it is easy to name a dozen from the top of your head, needless to say the ecchi market gets pretty monotonous... But what if a show centered  around a pervert girl instead? Well, that is exactly what B Gata H Kei decides to do. The result is no better than any number of ecchi titles that have the normal pervert male protagonist.\r\nThe show follows Yamada, an extremely attractive and sex obsessed girl, on her quest to get a hundred sex buddies during her time in high school. Theproblem is, despite being obsessed with sex, Yamada is naive when it comes down to the act, and self-continuous because she is a virgin; she is determined to have her first time with a fellow virgin. Enter Takashi Kosuda, an average high school guy, who just so happens to be a virgin. Of course its not going to be easy for Yamada, because Kosuda's a pretty dense fellow... *Sigh* What can be said about this premise; it's pretty dumb. To be fair, it is different (how many other shows can you name that follow a female lead as perverted as Yamada?), but outside of the weird role-reversal, B Gata H Kei does little to distinguish itself from its ecchi brethren.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the plot progresses is typical for this kind of show. Yamada meets Kosuda and does something that sanctimoniously grabs his attention and repels him from her... then it turns out that they are in the same class in school (of course) giving Yamada ample opportunity to seduce/ sexually harass Kotsuda; awkward moments and half-baked attempts to get laid ensue. Really, there is so little to say about the plot execution here, it is just bland, tired, and uninteresting. It doesn't help that the show is by nature, shallow and superficial... there really is no intensive to follow what is happening on screen, it's all sex jokes or some very forced attempts to build a relationship between its two leads.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are a collection of one-off stereotypes, and that's about all. Pretty much every character is doomed to one (or two, if we're lucky) repeating character trait that defines them. Kosuda is a bland and boring as a lead character gets, and spends all his screen time either misinterpreting Yamada's intentions or getting aroused thinking about her. The other characters are just as bad, consisting of Kosuda's childhood friend, who of course has a crush on him; Yamada's much more mature friend, who's only function is to make snark comments; Yamada's rival, who actually wants to lose her virginity to her brother (of course they would include an incest character)... and too many other poorly written characters to even count. Then there is our leading lady Yamada, who isn't a typical female lead, but her character can be summed up in a few of words: she wants to have sex, but is too timid... THAT'S ALL.\\n\\n\r\nTo say that the show has absolutely no redeeming qualities, though, is a lie. Admittedly, the show can be funny. Yamada's sex fantasies aren't always grating and can generate a few laughs every now and then; the same goes for Kosuda's being clueless. There are gags that work, for no other reason than they are silly or awkward. Even with this though, the series comedy can't be completely congratulated because it is used to death; yeah, if you're looking for a variety of humor, you won't find it here, nothing but crass sex jokes and snark comments. The second thing the show has going for it is the sex appeal, and yeah, it manages to that well. The show actually gets away with quite a bit... it is essentially like watching censored porn; while that doesn't sound too appealing, the show pulls it off with some very descriptive dialogue and well placed demon censor bars or other conveniently placed objects. When that's the best thing that can be said about a show, you know your in trouble.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, B Gata H Kei is generally underwhelming. The character designs are generic and forgettable, only appealing if you are in love with anime art style regardless of quality. Allegedly, Yamada is an extremely attractive girl, but honestly she's not better or worse looking than any of the other girls in her school. Backgrounds are stale, with maybe the exception of scenes in love hotels or make-out spots, even then it is nothing to write home about. The only thing that stands out visually are the demon censor bars and barely concealed fan-service. The show is not impressive in the sound department either, if anything it is less memorable. Its not bad but it is the usual pop music that is used all too often in slice-of-life anime. Really, if you don't have voyeuristic tendencies then B Gata H Kei's technical merits will do nothing for you (though it would be odd that you are even watching an ecchi in that case).\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, B Gata H Kei seems like a show that just wants to have fun, but ends up rather repulsive instead. Sure, something like this would never be sophistic or profound, but this hardly passes as cheap entertainment. The characters are as flat and plastic as they come, and the show doesn't even look good. Even if you are simply looking for some raunchy silliness, there are many other ecchi titles that are much more worth your time than this.\\n",

Hyperactive, sex addict, guy crazy, and has a friend that gives her good advice.\r\nI really liked the energy and excitement of the story, that and the interesting characters are what gave me a \"good\" impression of it. One thing I really did like and really stands out in this show is that it is not completely over the top. Most shows with the genre ecchi, school, and romance really overdo it with the nudity andfan service whenever they can. B.H.K was kind of like screw that nudity and fan service stuff, well give the viewers excitement and drama. The art was pretty decent for it's time, although it's nothing that really stands out. Overall I think this show is very good! and well planned out.",

            "content": "Upon reading the synopsis and seeing \"her dream was to have casual sex with 100 men,\" my mind went blank. I guess my testosterone levels were high at the time because by the time I knew it the whole anime was downloaded on my computer and the first episode was rolling.\r\nB Gata H Kei is a very \"sexually humored\" driven anime, I like it. Although this looks like a fan service anime it wasn't as flashy as say \"Rosario + Vampire\" or \"Ladies vs Butlers\" with up skirt galore every 5 secs. What really made this anime interesting is the different points of view itshows, seeing what each character is thinking really allows you to empathize with the characters and make it even funnier to know what each of them are thinking. The different awkward/extreme/erotic situations Yamada and Kosuda end up in are hilarious. All for the purpose of Yamadas plans to seduce Kosuda. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of the anime suited the anime well. Most of the girls are drawn not to make them perfect but to give them a sense of realism, they all have one of their own special \"features\" (eg big bewbs, slender body, cute face) , however they are not all perfect, which is a beautiful thannggg. Kosuda is presented as your average high school boy and he fits the description very well, hes not a blonde, feminine, perfect bishounen boy but an average looking boy with the build of a MAN.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of the anime was pretty average, the OP and ED weren't anything extraordinary. The voice acting was pretty good, they suited the characters quite well, I especially liked the \"OHOHOHO\" laugh of the rich girl Kanejou, oh Japan and your stereotypes. The random \"B Gata H Kei\" was surprisingly cute and catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is what I liked most about this anime, its hard to find a good horny female lead that actually has a personality. Damn, Yamada was so funny and very daring, she would go to extreme lengths to try to take Kosudas virginity, but somehow always fail. And her interpretation of things, seeing everything in a perverted way for example. Getting an earring as a present and seeing it as a symbol of \"I want to fuck you\" from Kosuda sent me into a state of hysteria of laughter. Kosuda, I really felt his pain when hes gets all confused as to why is this happening to him, man ALL THEM FEELS. I mean its not everyday a hot girl wants to steal your virginity. All through out the anime I was like oh damn if only you knew what she really wanted.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime, it really is a unique romance comedy. I didn't want it to end, but when it did I tried to look for similar anime with no luck. It was like finding a rare gem in the vast ocean, you'll never find another one.\\n\\n\r\nNow I've talked about the humor of this anime to a large extent, but this anime is also very unexpectedly romantic in a way, the intimacy the characters share shows the strong bond between them and really warms your heart to see them interacting. If you enjoy ecchi humor and surprisingly deep romance, I suggest you watch this anime. I don't recommend this to people who hate fan service, and \"dirty humor.\" \\n\\n\r\nBut really who doesn't like sex?",

            "content": "I'll be the first to admit that, somewhere in the back of my head, there's a dirty-minded twelve year old. I'm referring to the part of my brain that silently laughs at sleazy jokes, sexual slurs, and crude double entendres. You could call it immaturity, or just plain stupidity, but there are occasions where I think things of that nature are hilarious, and I'd be willing to bet that many people feel the same way. For various reasons, some good and some bad, some of us suppress the urge to laugh at this type of material\u2014we've found the little guy in our brain, and muzzledhim like a dog. So this type of comedy isn't going to hit the mark for everyone, and I can respect that. But if somewhere in your head that sneaky little bastard is still living, breathing, and laughing when badly written condom commercials come on the television, then you'll probably be able to derive a fair amount of enjoyment from B Gata H Kei.\\n\\n\r\nNormally I'd start a review with a brief description of the show's plot to establish a little context. But in this case, the synopsis offered by MAL is pretty adequate. If you're like me, you'll probably have to read it twice just to make sure your eyes weren't playing tricks on you. Rest assured that your sanity is intact. It really does say \u201cher dream was to have casual sex with 100 men.\u201d So, with that out of the way, let's talk comedy.\\n\\n\r\nIt'd be easy to brush the series off as raunchy and tasteless based on what you've read, and you'd only be half wrong in doing in so; a lot of the comedy in B Gata H Kei consists of jokes about masturbation, condoms, and breasts. Granted, they're presented a little more cleverly than average, and often the jokes work in ways that are wholly unexpected. Many punchlines are reached through a window into the thoughts and fantasies of the characters, and this makes for a welcome mixture of visual and lingual humor that keeps things from getting too stale.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what makes some of the comedy work is the endearing amount of self-awareness that the show seems to possess, and the frequency with which it pokes fun at some of the cliches and cheesier elements of traditional high-school comedies. Sarcastic jabs are made at the overused visual effects in which female characters \u201csparkle\u201d when happy and project a visible black \u201caura\u201d when angry. The same treatment is given to the cliche of having a foreign character appear attractive and classy, with the students frequently chanting \u201cRaised overseas, indeed\u201d in approval of an American-raised classmate. A few of the dimwitted male supporting characters seem to be aware of their own uselessness, and in one scene they comment that they're having fun because they're \u201cgetting more lines than usual.\u201d These elements add a sense of wit and variety to what would otherwise be a show made entirely of shameless sexual humor. Many shows make the fatal mistake of taking themselves too seriously. B Gata H Kei, on the other hand, knows that it's a raunchy romcom, and embraces it.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters appears to have been put together pretty thoughtfully, and most of them add comedic value to the show in one way or another. Yamada herself is a walking joke, a play on the ideal \u201cpure\u201d schoolgirl that is depicted in most high-school shows. Her and the spacy, awkward Kosuda play very well off each other; Yamada projects an outward appearance of confidence and sexuality, but really, she's every bit as bumbling and insecure as her target. Sometimes the show generates humor based on sheer awkwardness as we watch both of them desperately try to figure out the meaning of the gestures made by the other. They both want the same thing, but they're both too thick-headed to do anything but beat around the bush.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the two leads, the supporting roles are also used to good effect. It's a pretty big cast, but a few particular standouts include: Yamada's best friend, Takeshita, who delivers lines in a deadpan manner that's often as funny, if not funnier than, the over-the-top antics of the other characters; Misato, a thin and unattractive female classmate whose sexual frustration and inability to score are the butt of many a joke; Kyoka Kanejou, a rich and beautiful girl who is envious of Yamada and attempts to steal away the clueless Kosuda.\\n\\n\r\nIt might also sound strange to say this, but B Gata H Kei actually does have thematic elements that are worth mentioning. Buried under a mountain of jokes, there's a cute little plot about two teenagers who are growing up just a little too fast, and trying to rush something that shouldn't be rushed. That isn't exactly winning the series any points in the originality department, and I must express a slight disappointment that such an original (and, frankly, just plain weird) idea quickly turns into something so ordinary. But nonetheless, it's nice to see a show where the comedy is formed around storytelling elements. Many comedies completely abandon the concept of \u201cstory\u201d and just try to pour on the laughs, but B Gata H Kei makes no such mistake; most of the comedy is a natural extension of the plot. It's also worth noting that in terms of a \u201crealistic\u201d depiction of the pervasive awkwardness and uncertainty involved in early-teen relationships, B Gata H Kei comes pretty darn close despite the absurdity of its original premises.\\n\\n\r\nIn the sound department, the series checks in at right about average. If you've heard one \u201cmessing around in high school\u201d soundtrack, you've pretty much heard them all. There are upbeat jazz/pop songs meant to accentuate moments of rapid comedic dialogue and cute orchestral tracks for romantic and/or sad moments. The music here isn't a flop, but neither is it particularly memorable. The voice acting, on the other hand, is excellent. The two mains are perfect foils for each other. Yamada's voice is bold and ever-so-slightly masculine, while Kosuda's is generic and submissive. It's easy to see that these voice actors nailed it. Even the supporting cast manages to sound unique.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, B Gata H Kei is, once again, just about average. The character designs are not offensive, but merely as generic as you can get. I'll give them a break on Kosuda, because he's intentionally designed to look as uninteresting as possible, but all of the other characters really do look like they would be pages in a book titled \u201cDrawing High Schoolers on a Budget.\u201d The most frequent setting is the classroom, so there are not a lot of chances to show off the background art, which is reasonably attractive. The animation is mediocre, but whether or not this really matters is a different question, since motion is rarely a part of the comedic styling or plot progression of the series. This is not a great looking show, but the visuals are adequate to get us where we're going.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I'm left with the impression that B Gata H Kei certainly isn't a groundbreaking or incredible series. There are a few missteps and missed opportunities. But if you're looking for something that's lighthearted, cute, funny, and doesn't take itself too seriously, this is a good option\u2014provided you can bear in mind that much of the humor here is shameless and racy, and embrace that fact.",

            "content": "B Gata H Kei ended up being not quite what I expected.  I would have been perfectly content with the premise as laid out, and yet what I was given was a story sweeter than a lot of other anime set out to create.  The show barely has fanservice beyond the first episode, and when there is nudity at all, it feels like you have trespassed into an intimate moment.  The framing of these scenes becomes deliberately nonsexual, because the point isn't to tease the viewer, but help you empathize with the emotions of protagonist Yamada.\r\nYamada is a type of character Idon't often see allowed to exist in anime.  Reminiscent of Tomoko from Watamote, she is unabashedly an asshole but also deeply vulnerable in a realistic and relatable way.  Her characterization could have been pushed further, there was a lot more room for her to grow, but as it stands, I was happy to once again see a female character portrayed in this type of light.  Adolescence is hard, and I found a lot of common ground with Yamada, even if she simultaneously frustrates me with the way she treats people.  The climactic scene of the series might also be one of my favorites in anime, it is definitely the most well done part of the show.  It felt written and directed full of love and compassion, and was very refreshing after seeing so many characters in so many other series barely get anywhere in their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nI can't really say I disliked all that much about this series, aside from Yamada needing some more character development, and maybe more side character growth as well.  The dub was well localized, so it was funny enough.  I would recommend this series to anyone who likes romance and seeing couples come together- you really shouldn't be disappointed if that is what you're looking for.  As you can see by the other reviews, this show resonated with a lot of people.",

We have a young adolescent, ambitious for sex, otherwise known as the famous Yamada throughout the whole series. The whole story revolves around our heroine attempting to get a rather large amount of \"sex buddies\". Getting there might be quite hard for her, considering she is insecure about the appearance of her vagina. Due to this, she seeks for a male partner, also a virgin, which is where our dear Kosuda comes in.\r\nThese two characters both are two opposites, it isn't mentioned throughout the series, but usviewers could probably determine it. First we've got Yamada, our omniscient sex do-want female. A true beaut amongst her classmates, seeking for intimate relationships. Then there's Kosuda, a young adolescent that endeavors to even understand Yamada.\\n\\n\r\nIn this relationship, Yamada is the dirty one. Makes it more fun, eh? They both deserve a well earned 9.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation for this anime was amazing, though I give it an 8 because I'm not a fan of the big head skinny neck art. It's good, but not exactly my cup of tea. Asides that, everything was made exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was great, as well. The opening and ending are a joy themselves for those who watch the whole episode. The background music played throughout is well fitted, makes the essence more vivid.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy the anime? But of course, the series is far too short to drag, and every episode keeps you wanting more of Yamada. You never know what she has to bring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime a 9.The plot was very original, and it was outstanding.\\n\\n\r\n~A side note, I'm not one who reviews animes a lot, and this is infact my first review.

            "content": "B Gata H Kei is wrong in all of the right ways. I feel like this kind of series might not attract many girls, but if you are female, it isn't just a show of male fantasy.  I couldn't get enough of it, and found myself wanting more even as the last episode finished. I'm not much a fan of ecchi, but sometimes something will spark my interest and I have to watch it. This series was definitely one of those.\r\nStory: 8. This story is about a high school girl who wants to have sex with one hundred men. That said, a viewer mightthink this series includes a lot of sex when it is mostly about a girl and a guy in high school who want to have sex and have no idea what to do. It's very real to life, and somewhat similar to what I went through in high school. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8. The artwork was good and the facial expressions, hilarious. It didn't have a point where the art lacked like a lot of newer series, and overall, it was pleasant to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7. I give it a seven because, to be honest, some of the voice acting can get a bit on my nerves at times. It's not nearly as bad as some of the series I've seen, but a few of the voices of the minor characters were annoying. It's not a big problem, and the overall sound quality was fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8. The characters were all fairly unique and all of the characters had their own interesting points. The main characters, Yamada and Kosuda were fairly typical teenagers, and I think they're fairly relate-able in this regard.  The minor characters were all interesting as well, and I never felt like the characters were bringing down the story at all. I honestly would very much like spinoffs featuring some of them, because it would be hilarious as well as interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9. I'm a bit of a sadist, so I thoroughly enjoyed watching every installment of Yamada and Kosuda fail at trying to have sex with each other. Personally, I found this series a laugh a minute, and I spent so much time trying not to laugh, especially during the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8. As I said, it's bad in all the right ways. It's distinctly filthy where it needs to be and really shows how awkward talking about sex and having sex for the first time can really be. There's not much I can say without giving spoilers, but from the moment I heard this show's premise, I knew I was going to love it.",

            "content": "This show is a lot more than what it presents to you during it's premiere episode. Sure, it has it's ecchi parts, but I take it more as a more realistic romance than most animes we see. Most romance animes hold kissing as the climax of the entire show, and it is rarely seen that sex or anything beyond that is portrayed. Today we dive into the vulgar, sex-joke filled realm of B Gata H Kei, and see what stood strong and what flopped (lol i dirty).\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nStory: \r\nThe premise is rather simple: Yamada wants to get laid a hundred times but wants to start itoff with a virgin, just like her. The thing is that this premise is completely false to what the show is actually setting off to do. Since Yamada is so inexperienced in sex and all things dirty, she is all but willing to jump in bed with the main male protagonist and resident cherry boy Kosuda. It instead focuses more on the relationship between the two and their various endeavors to get rid of the god-forsaken V-card. Coupled with the fast paced and hilarious(most of the time) comedy, works very well. Let's just say that if you like vulgar, low-brow comedy, you'll get a kick out of this. However,the ending really puts a bad aftertaste in you're mouth. There is so many plot holes that leave you guessing. Absolutely nothing gets accomplished, and this includes the side stories. It's basically a \"Read the Manga\" style ending, which kind of sucks.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIn most cases, I think Yamada would be a character I would outright despise. But since this is an ecchi comedy show, her naivety and overall cowardness brings a lot to the table in terms of comedy. Sure, she can be downright annoying and tsundere at times, but she just fits into the overall theme of the show so well that you can look past a lot of the faults she has. Then we have Kosuda, the similarly shy, but more passive than aggressive love interest. I liked his character mainly because even though Yamada is flirting around this guy like mad, he still has the sense to take it relatively slow, and treat her like more than a walking pair of breasts, which is basically a complete contrast to Yamada. Their relationship is more or less a combination between Japanese and Western romances. There is the lust and want for sex, but then you have the awkwardidity (ya I totally didn't make that word up) to actually do that stuff. It's much more refreshing than anything. Moving on, the supporting cast did what they needed to, but could have had a bit more development in the long run. As weird as it is for me to say this, I want to figure out what the how the weird incest side plot between two characters was going to work out. They added a lot more comedy to the show, and the show already has a lot to begin with. This goes back to the plot hole ending, where a bit more time could've fleshed out the characters to be more likeable in the long run.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nSound and Animation:\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't anything special about these, to be honest. The animation was fair, but their wasn't enough movement to really observe and call it amazing. The art style worked, but felt 2D in places. And of course, the character designs were sexy where they needed to be, but still a little simple. The soundtrack is really quite forgettable, as nothing stood out to me in the slightest. However, I am quite pleased with the voice acting in this particular anime. There were a few missteps in the English dub (Kanajo), as some voices did sound a bit stale, but for the most part, the over-exuberant voices added to the comedy aspect of the show immensely. To end off on a high note, the opening was catchy, and had the best animation in the entire show, so, major plus there. \\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nTo end off, this show is definitely something at least some people would enjoy. The whole show just screams hilarity, whether it be from Yamada's random antics to the deity's spewing of dirty sex jokes. However, the ending was utter crap, and left so many plot holes you could fly a plane through and end up in Japan to yell at the writers about it. Furthermore, although I did like Yamada's character and thought she fit with the show extremely well, I can see how many can see her as a major turn off from her slutty aspect. But lets be honest here, this is an ecchi show, so it's to be expected. The animation and sound are passable, but really are not anything special by any stretch of the imagination.In summary, this show is flawed in many aspects, leaving it with an average score, but for the \"turn you're brain off\" aspect, which in this show is the most important aspect, succeeds with flying colours.  B Gata H Kei is not something to have on the top of you're list, but if you want to turn you're brain off and let you're hormones and funny bone run wild for a while, this is a pretty good recommendation.",

            "content": "This is NOT your typical fan service perverted ecchi.  Indeed, I have never watched an ecchi anime before this one and was drawn to this series because Brittney Karbowski had provided the dubbing.\r\nThe trailer and advertising does not do the show any favours and any anime fan may roll their eyes at such a ridiculous premise of a story.  This would be a mistake.  In reality, this excellent series is a very humourous light-hearted comedy and the true story is that of Yamada's misconception of sex and the 'first-time'.  Her relentless pursuit of the harmless Kosuda as her first partner 'tobreak the seal' sees the development of an unlikely teenage relationship.\\n\\n\r\nYamada is a somewhat typical tsundere character and the English dubbing does her complete justice.  I was so impressed with the humour, I actually read the rest of the manga and was further impressed with the quality of the story after the anime ends.  It certainly whets your appetite and I hope they do a second series.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual nudity in the series is occasional and appropriate to the setting.  It would equally fit in well with a drama or romance anime and, as mentioned, is atypical of an 'ecchi' anime.  I would go so far as to say this really should be reclassified as a romantic-comedy.\\n\\n\r\nDon't be put be off by the idea that this is an 'ecchi' and of the theme of Yamada's goals - the real story is something much more than this and will have you in stitches.",

Well my friends, this anime not only depicts these moments, but takes it to a whole other level. For an ecchi anime to portray such misgivings of youth, well... They did a kick-ass job!\r\nStory - 10:\r\nFirst off, the introduction of the storyline is something that I, nor I think anybody in the real world would ever be able to see; at least in a rational one.  100 sex friends?Well that got my attention.  \\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is original at least to a point: girl wants some; girl finds  guy, girl falls in love, the end.  But of course along the way, she encounters many \"obstacles\".  Don't want to give anymore spoilers.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9:\\n\\n\r\nThe art was crisp and vibrant.  There was no need for any \"real world\" effects here, just crazy scenes with the typical anime emoticons you find in a lot of comedy-style animes.  Although... Some of the girls have disproportionately large ta-ta's for their heights (not too mention age -  though sometimes that happens in real life too).  But hey  an ecchi anime almost always requires those right?i  Boin away!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8:\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are very cutesy, and definitely lively.  It's so fitting for the main character's personality.   It has a moe feel, but you will know that feeling arises after watching at least one episode\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10:\\n\\n\r\nThis is where anime shines the most.  The Main character Yamada isn't your normal school girl, and by \"normal\" I mean that in psychological terms.  She has that tsundere-like feel sometimes, but most of the time, she would do nothing but think about what most guys think about their whole life: sex. That itself is an original; not to mention a shock in our society.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main character Takashi is that of an awkward boy just trying to survive high school, who happens to get the nickname \"cherry boy\" when he meets Yamada for the first time.  By awkward, I mean trip on a peanut awkward.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters we have the un-datable girl, the little spoiled (and kiss x sis-like) princess,  the shy childhood lady friend, and of course the rational friend. An almost complete set\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - >10:\\n\\n\r\nYes, it was that great.  I looked forward to every episode because I know I have to order new lungs because I would laugh so hard.  Not only that, some of the scenarios are what typical teenagers face, which prompted me in flashbacks; these then would cause me to either laugh more, or scream like a little girl.  Yes, it invoked many voices out of me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9.5:\\n\\n\r\nHaving no decimal point system, I will break the law of round out by giving it a 9 on the official board.  The whole series was funny, ecchi, and sometimes even reminded me of some awkward situations. the 0.5 lost was for some of the slow episodes which I really did not expect.\\n\\n\\n\r\nYou want ecchi, it's got plenty, you want high school, they got it also. You want a horny girl, it's got it.  This is one of the most entertaining animes I've watched for 2010.",

            "content": "After reading the many glowing review of B Gata H Kei, I feel like I watched a completely different show. It's a very watchable but very unlikeable anime.\r\nIt begins well enough with Yamada wanting to lose her virginity so she can work toward her highest goal of having 100 fuck buddies. The best person to lose her virginity to, she decides, is Kosuda, another virgin. Yamada makes a few bold actions toward Kosuda but she never follows through or explains herself. Kosuda is not an idiot, he's just completely bewildered by this deranged girl. This is where the series falls apart.\r\nYamada will make advances towardKosuda only to push him away or yell at him. She's the main character and after only a couple of episodes, you're completely against her. After the pair walk home in the rain, you think that she will begin to develop real feelings for Kosuda, but instead she becomes more rude toward him. It doesn't matter that Yamada's actions are due to her being scared of actually having sex; she comes across as an unlikeable lunatic.\\n\\n\r\nEventually a villain of sorts is introduced - the beautiful and popular Kanejou. She plots to find, steal, and dump Yamada's boyfriend. Also introduced is Kosuda's childhood friend - a girl named Mayu who actually likes and wants to be with Kosuda. These are the characters you should be cheering on. Unfortunately, their stories ultimately go nowhere while Yamada and Kosuda build up to a disappointing ending. Yamada almost has a redemption in the last couple of episodes, but it's difficult to see if she really changed or not.",

Anyways you think this is your chip-off the old block fanservice, ecchi anime? No and yes.\r\nWhy No?\r\nThe main character of this anime is Yamada, a 15 year old teenager in a questionable heat of things. For one, her priority is nothing but sex in a relationship and wants as many partners as possible. Her best friend, a big-breasted girl, Takeshita, is always looking out for her. Even to the point she is sick and tired of slappingsense in her head. A loyal friend indeed.\\n\\n\r\nHakuro: Yamada might want to get a HIV check when she's 30 if that happens\\n\\n\r\nWell that WAS her goal. Until she found a suitable prey.\\n\r\nIntroducing the main man of this anime. Takashi Kosuda!. Your normal, average, ordinary 15 year old boy. Being hunted down by the predator Yamada. Like I said, ordinary. Nothing special except his \"cherry status\" (chastity) that Yamada is after.\\n\\n\r\nWhy Yes?\\n\r\nThe \"run-in to the boy you met before in school the next day kind of starting\" with a twist. Well there are classic scenes with underwear showing accidentally. But other than that. Nothing.\\n\\n\r\nI'm done with the characters side. All in all this anime is hilariously funny.\\n\\n\r\nArt: As an aspiring mangaka I have to say the art is pretty cute. And the background and scenery is very detailed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Average. Nothing much but adds a serious funny effect when it comes to the funny parts. LOL\\n\\n\r\nHai~sankyuu for taking your time to read my review. Don't kill me, its my 2nd time and this is for old-times sake since its ending soon. (:\\n\\n",

Yet he is so stupid to misjudge the main girl's hornyiness for actual love, how stupid do you have to be to see a girl flashing at you is a sign oflove :L.\\n\\n\r\nThe Main Girl Character Yamada, is a character which basically sums up everything that makes up a popular girl. Only caring about her looks, vain and wants to use that so just so she can literally (fuck guys over) as you would know from the synopsis of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters role in this show is so small, that if they were not there the show would probably still be as bad -.-.\\n\\n\r\nI thought as this is a comedy show, there would be some good jokes to divert the viewers from the rubbish main characters and man was I wrong. The jokes have no build up, there's no reaction in the show from them and to be fair they wouldn't be as they are so damn bland, it makes you fall asleep. \\n\\n\r\nThis show tries to be different by setting it up in the girl's view, although this may sound good, it's executed appallingly, it gave me nothing that made the show good or even at times watchable.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story... simply put there is none at all \\n\\n\r\nArt: Nothing that would catch your eye, but its just there to accommodate the show.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: What music? Apart from the okay OP and ED songs which give you a false indication of what the show is like, there is nothing that makes you go this goes well with the show.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up what I think about this show: Avoid it... just don't watch it, otherwise you'll be watching a show that is straight up annoying and stupid.\\n\\n\r\nComedy shows are my comfort zone, but this has no comedy just a MC who's completely thick and a girl MC who is so vain and who no girl should ever aspire to be ever, if you do then i truly don't know what to say -.-.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has three things that sum it up:\\n\r\nStupid\\n\r\nBland\\n\r\nDull\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy those things, then this is the anime for you \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Relationships can be one of the craziest puzzles of life, and are without a doubt one of the most enjoyable parts of being a teenager. Unless of course, you can\u2019t get a girlfriend and you look really plain and boring. That\u2019s the problem with Takasu Kosuda. He\u2019s average looking and not all that exciting. But somehow he manages to find himself in a weird relationship with one of the hottest girls in his high school, Yamada. The problem is he doesn\u2019t understand that she only wants him to bang him because her whole goal in life is to have one hundred \u201cfuck-buddies\u201d. So essentially, she\u2019sthe biggest slut around and is the main character of this romantic comedy anime, meaning I\u2019m supposed to enjoy watching her trials and errors in getting to shag Kosuda.The problem with this idea is the fact that she is so reprehensible and reminds me of every episode of Dr. Phil showcasing wild, sex crazed teens. But we\u2019ll talk about her in a moment. Right now, let\u2019s touch a little more on the story of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nGuy meets girl. Girl\u2019s a slut. Guy falls for girl, not realizing she\u2019s just in it to bang him because she thinks he will be easy. Girl falls for guy and that\u2019s it. There is of course some competition over the guy and a girl who likes him but won\u2019t admit to it. It\u2019s just straight up genericism, which is a word I\u2019ve been using way too often for romantic comedies. I mean, I can deal with some plot conventions and the obligatory scenes, but there comes a point in time where you ask yourself why these shows can\u2019t be just a tad different. You pull the characters from one show, put them in another; pull the backgrounds from one show, put them in another. Original romantic comedies are hard to come by, and admittedly my favorite, Toradora!, is quite honestly very conventional. And B Gata H Kei follows the same conventions that just get to be like a chore. Here\u2019s the obligatory scenes I seem to mention for every romantic comedy review:\\n\\n\r\n-The Pool (x2 even!)\\n\r\n-Festival (Why is it that every time you go to the pool it is followed by a random festival?)\\n\r\n-Cultural Festival (Why is it always a maid caf\u00e9 or a caf\u00e9 of some sort?)\\n\r\n-Field Trip\\n\r\n-Bath\\n\r\n-Bathhouse\\n\r\n-Christmas (x2)\\n\\n\r\nAnd the formula for these areas aren\u2019t changed at all. It\u2019s all very typical and unintuitive. Some people might get their panties in a bunch because of some of the mentions and my being too picky about what is conventional and what isn\u2019t. For them I have to say that there are millions of things to do and places to go yet romance/comedy series always wind up at these same places. I have even gone so far as to commend one anime for the sheer fact it used a karaoke establishment as a setting. I mean, this anime I will commend for the love hotel scene, which I can\u2019t commend as much for the content as the use of the hotel. Because while I do enjoy a good bout of sex every once in a while, the sex scenes in this show are idiotic. I mean, they aren\u2019t really \u201csex\u201d scenes because nothing ever gets accomplished (at least, in the \u201cclimax\u201d sense) but they still exhibit a sort of reprehensible aura. And I didn\u2019t feel it as much from main character Yamada. She\u2019s the one who wants to bang, yet she\u2019s very reserved and kind of shy about it. Kosuda, the quiet and boring one is the most feral of the two and for a virgin, he sure goes right for it like a playa.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s even more reprehensible is if you actually look at how many times Kosuda and Yamada have gone out and how much they really know about each other, their having sex is completely ridiculous. Just the fact that they love each other and know jack-shit about each other in and of itself is weird. The romantic parts of the comedy fall short because of that.\\n\\n\r\nThough I will admit that the sex scenes and a lot of the sex related humor toward the end were hilarious. But otherwise the anime isn\u2019t that funny. About partway through there is a point where Yamada tells the camera \u201cThat last bit wasn\u2019t raunchy enough\u201d. To tell the truth, up to the very end, which is actually pretty unexpectedly risqu\u00e9, B Gata H Kei isn\u2019t all that raunchy. Its comedy is an attempt at raunch, but not a good one. Let\u2019s face it, boner jokes aren\u2019t all that funny after you\u2019ve had a couple hundred over the course of your life and you can\u2019t make me laugh with more boob jokes. The condom joke is overplayed and it isn\u2019t very funny most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is okay. Characters do look decent, and backgrounds as well, but it\u2019s all very average and unexciting.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme could be pasted onto any romantic comedy, as could the ending. The music during the show is basic. Characters all sound good.\\n\\n\r\nThe character section is typically where I bash a show and this is no different. Let\u2019s start with Kosuda who I found to be a piece of cardboard at first. He had no character whatsoever. Which is part of the whole idea, he\u2019s a basic looking guy with no distinct personality traits. But as stated previously, the moment that sex comes up he becomes an animal. Which, yes, he\u2019s a guy so that is easily the case. But a virgin? And he\u2019s so embarrassed by it too yet goes at it like a trooper. His character is confusing because of those mood swings.\\n\\n\r\nYamada is a different entity that I\u2019ve touched upon a bit. At the start of the anime she\u2019s reprehensible. She\u2019s borderline disgusting. I mean, the first scene of her entails her checking out her private bits and complaining because it looks weird. And then she goes to this one hundred fuck buddies deal and she degrades from there. As things develop between her and Kosuda, it starts off downright horrible where she is using him and abusing him. She doesn\u2019t seem to like him and he likes her. And while this romance is both rushed and unrealistic, it still is painful to watch her string him out and when she finally admits to liking him a great weight is lifted from my chest. And so many people like this character! Sure, she was a bit more likeable toward the end, but she was still a bad character who never grows on you.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet one of the most hated characters of the series is Kyouka Kanejou? Sure, the creepy brother love thing was creepy, but she was just as bad as Yamada. She is of course, your typical rich bitchy  girl who hides behind a cute mask. She\u2019s essentially Ami from Toradora!. Hell, she IS Ami from Toradora! with a brother complex. She even tries to steal Kosuda from Yamada at one point, just like Ami attempting to steal Ryuuji!\\n\\n\r\nThe other major character is Mayu Miyano, who is just as boring as every other character. She\u2019s a klutz, she likes Kosuda but can\u2019t get the balls to tell him, and is just there. She doesn\u2019t do much or accomplish much.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s sad when my favorite character is Mami Misato, who was one of the characters with the least role in the show. She\u2019s a tiny, crazy girl. She\u2019s in love with Kanejou\u2019s brother (just like Kanejou) and is actually fairly entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, the rest of the characters aren\u2019t interesting enough to get into.\\n\\n\r\nThere are so many questions I want to ask the creator of this show. Where did the idea come from? Where is the funny? And then there are just general questions I ask myself such as: When did incest become a conventional plot device in romantic comedies?\\n\\n\r\nYou know why something like Toradora! worked despite being fairly conventional? Because it had likeable characters, that while cut and paste, acted realistically and took on a life of their own. Also, the relationships and emotions were believable. Something like this cannot even compare to that. The best merit I can give this anime is that it has a clearly defined romance and it ends satisfactorily.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, B Gata H Kei is pretty bad.  I can\u2019t believe the sheer amount of good reviews this gets. If you\u2019re in middle school it may be funny because \u201cSEX\u201d and \u201cCONDOMS\u201d and \u201cBOOBS\u201d but if you have grown to an age where you are more mature than that, you\u2019ll realize that this is idiotic and a waste of time. I mean, I respect everyone\u2019s good reviews of it, but I just don\u2019t understand how anyone can love the character of Yamada. Even if you take her as a funny caricature of a typical high school girl she\u2019s still downright unlikeable.\\n\\n\r\nThere are much better romantic comedies out there.",

Just from looking at the cover I thought it was yet another fanservice harem anime directed toward the male audience. However, upon looking at the description, I realized my thoughts were wrong. Besides, they always say you can't judge a book by it's cover!\r\nThe main character, Yamada, is the prettiest girl at her school. Every guy wants to have her while every girl wants to be her. Her dream is to have sex withover 100 guys. However, there's a couple of problems. She still had her v-card, has never been kissed, and she thinks her vagina looks weird. To kick off this dream, she plans to find a cherry boy to take over. One day, she runs into a classmate of hers, Kosuda, and she can literally just smell the cherries from this boy. So she decides that he is the one. Ever since their encounter, she is determined to have him as her first. Along the way you meet other characters that get in the middle of whatever relationship they have going on. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime truly delivers. It's absolutely hilarious and if you're into dubs, it has a good one! It's dubbed by Funimation, and they truly picked a wonderful cast for it. If you have Netflix and you're not sure what anime you should watch on there, I highly recommend this one. I would probably watch it as soon as you can because Netflix goes through their anime really fast!\\n\\n\r\nThe ecchi is not as bad as you probably think it is. Of course, there are your regular bouncy boob jokes but they happen maybe less than seven times throughout the show. There are quite a few sex jokes and some nudity near the end, so I definitely don't recommend this to the younger anime fans! \\n\\n\r\nI truly enjoyed this anime. I give it a 10/10! And to top it all off, it has great music! The opening is so catchy and I never skipped it once. The animation is pretty good, too! \\n\\n\r\nThis is my very first review, so I hope it was helpful!",

            "content": "Yamada (No first name given) is a fifteen year old high school student at the top of the food chain. Every girl wants to be her, every boy wants to be with her, and she wants to have sex with 100 guys.\r\nWhile that may sound like the premise for the most thinly-veiled escapist jerk-off fantasy since Kiss X Sis, Let me make two things perfectly clear: First of all, unlike the two abominable creatures from KXS, Yamada doesn\u2019t live in a world where her behavior is considered normal, or even worse, encouraged. She lives in a world much closer to our own, and the fewpeople who know about her endeavor spend a decent amount of effort trying to advise her and keep her under control.\\n\\n\r\nAnd second of all, Yamada is all talk. She\u2019s a virgin, and the story clearly acknowledges that she has no idea what sex is, let alone how to get up the nerve to have it. In order to gain experience and overcome her insecurities, she decides that the first step towards carnal domination is to sleep with a boy in her class named Kosuda, because, in her words, he\u2019s a \u201cPlain Jane cherry boy.\u201d Yes, Cherry boy is term they use.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, these two plot elements go a long way in making the character of Yamada not only funny, but 1000 times more likeable than she should be. Her constant efforts to take a step towards losing her virginity are peppered with her complete lack of understanding about common logic or human behavior. She is, in every way, a dog chasing a car, and it is hilarious at nearly every turn.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, did I mention that several characters get an Eros deity? A little chibi wiseman version of themselves that floats on a cloud and gives them comically misleading sex advice that they can\u2019t even hear? Yes, that element could easily become annoying, and probably will for some people, but unlike the narrator from Okami-san, they only appear once in a while, and remain consistently funny when used. You could take them or leave them, but I thought they were great.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if you don\u2019t notice early on from such exquisite phrases as \u201cTotes,\u201d \u201cCherry boy,\u201d \u201cWhat the crap,\u201d and \u201cRocking your V Card,\u201d this is a Jamie Marchi script, and her dialogue has a habit of being a little\u2026 Slangy. And while it\u2019s subdued, there is an element of pop culture references as well. To put it bluntly, Yamada randomly blurts out the most inappropriate things, and much like the dub for Panty and Stocking, Marchi\u2019s writing can occasionally reek of \u2018trying too hard.\u2019 Thankfully , the actors do a pretty damn good job with it, especially Yamada\u2019s VA. Her voice is supplied by Brittany Karbowski, who\u2019s been rapidly climbing up my favorites list lately. I am convinced that she can deliver any line you put in front of her, no matter how ridiculous or obscene, without losing a single drop of sincerity. She goes a long way towards making this a highly recommendable dub. The other actors do their jobs really well, too\u2026 Cherami Leigh does a commendable job going out of her comfort zone to play Yamada\u2019s long suffering best friend/straight man foil Miharu, and the deity actors fill out their roles as well, but Brittany is really the one who makes the script hers.\\n\\n\r\nScott Freeman doesn\u2019t have a particularly difficult job, playing a character like Kosuda\u2026 He\u2019s bland and ordinary, but compared to most anime male leads, he\u2019s actually rather unique\u2026 He reacts to Yamada\u2019s sexually confused insanity the way a normal boy would, rather than just getting freaked out and taking a moral high ground. Although he\u2019s confused about what her advances mean, he\u2019s still receptive to them, although as it turns out, he\u2019s just as nervous and unsure as she is. And thank god, for once, both characters screw things up just as often.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few other elements at play, dealing with Miharu\u2019s boyfriend, Yamada\u2019s younger sister, Kosuda\u2019s childhood friend, Kosuda\u2019s older sister\u2026 I\u2019m happy to say they actually ACT like brother and sister\u2026 But the main sub-plot deals with Kyoko Kanejo, a rich transfer student and rival for Yamada. Their rivalry in the fields of both beauty and popularity go a long way in highlighting just how shallow these values are, but the most memorable thing about her would be her \u2018dark secret\u2026\u2019 And once it\u2019s revealed, it\u2019s a story element that would normally bug the crap out of me were it handled any different. But like Yamada\u2019s ambitions, the fact that she\u2019s completely delusional about it saves her from being wholly unlikeable.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of the opening, the animation honestly isn\u2019t very good. Talking heads prevail, and the animators are not exactly coy about the budget saving tricks they\u2019re using\u2026 speed lines for intensity, bouncing images for walking, and so on and so forth. Thankfully, unless there are a bunch of frozen characters in the background, it\u2019s easy to ignore. On the other hand, where the show really shines is with it\u2019s artwork. The backgrounds, while stiff, are highly detailed and vibrantly colored. The character designs are well thought out, very expressive, and easily recognizable.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really impresses me about this series is it\u2019s dual appeal. For those looking for a gleefully sadistic sex comedy, Yamada\u2019s First is exactly that\u2026 The jokes are fast paced, well executed, and rarely ever miss the mark. There\u2019s fan service abound, but it\u2019s rarely ever in bad taste.\\n\\n\r\nFor those looking for something a little deeper, this show hasn\u2019t forgotten you, either. It has an almost nostalgic feel to it, as if it were written by someone who wanted to see how an exaggerated, over-the-top version of themselves would have dealt with their own real life experiences. The character development is subtle, as Yamada slowly gets a grasp on the reality of her feelings and hormones, and Kosuda slowly becomes more interesting and likeable as he interacts with her.\\n\\n\r\nI was a little shocked to discover that it was based on a four-panel manga. Normally, you can tell this right off the bat from the story limitations and the pacing of the jokes, but up until I looked it up, I honestly thought it was based on a more traditional style manga. The pacing of the jokes is kind of a dead giveaway, but the story seemed to flow a lot smoother and more seamlessly than similar titles like Kill Me Baby, Azumanga Daioh and Lucky Star.\\n\\n\r\nYamada\u2019s First Time is available from Funimation. You can stream it pretty much anywhere, or just watch it for free on Netflix. I wouldn\u2019t recommend paying full price for it, but if you can find it on sale on Amazon\u2026 It\u2019s about 23 dollars for the BR/DVD combo pack at this particular moment\u2026 Then you should totes go for it.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this series works great as a comedy, and just as well as a coming of age story, as it takes an unflinching yet not unforgiving look at the genuine awkwardness of adolescent relationships. It has a few minor hiccups, and we never do find out where Yamada\u2019s thirst for sexual conquest came from, but it\u2019s hard to deride a show that\u2019s this consistently funny and unpredictable. I give Yamada\u2019s First Time an 8/10.",

            "content": "Okay so I'll be honest. I read reviews before first starting the series. And from the first episode I could understand what people meant when they said it was insulting to women. After a few episodes though I realized Yamada only wanted her first time to be special and her indifferent attitude about the whole thing was just because she was scared. The intial reason she wants to go out with Kosuda is because he's a virgin. \r\nWhen she falls in love with him she realizes she doesn't want someone experienced who will just dump her afterwards. That being said! I think that Yamada wasreally shallow. I mean of course Kosuda, the average guy, (like Hedeki-Chobits, Kouta-Elfen Lied) is going to fall in love with a beautiful girl who acts like she's interested. None of the story was even fair to him. \\n\r\nHe actually liked Yamada. There is one point where he does question his decision though. He actually wants to make sure he likes Yamada and not just her body. The fact that they have to ask themselves if they really like each other speaks wonders about they're relationship. They are trying to hook up and they know nothing about each other. \\n\r\nI found the sex gods hilarious. It was a good way to keep everything censored by using humor instead being like \"we cant show this\" so that was funny and cute the way the were incooperated. \\n\r\nKanejou, kanejou, kanejou. She was really incestual and creepy. Her love for her brother was entertaining but it became too obsessive and stand offish. It was kind of disgusting to watch after awhile and she became a character I was annoyed with very very easily. \\n\r\nHer brother was just annoying. The only reason he was after Yamada was because he couldn't have her. And although I didn't like him what the hell happened to him and Kanejou in the end. They pretty much disappeared along with every other character.\\n\r\nOn the subject of sexual guidance Kosuda's sister was pretty brilliant. She was very funny and even though she made some situations awkward she was Kosuda's support the whole show. \\n\r\nMiyano definately should've been the one to end up with Kosuda especially because SHE REALLY LIKES HIM unlike Yamada (in the beginning) \\n\r\nAll in all the show was pretty great. It carried elements every romance anime should have and I was pretty happy with it",

            "content": "It looks like the ole Rom/Com formula has poked it's face again and in b gata h kei that face is beautiful, sexy, and very very funny. You probably read the synopsis and seen that this anime is given an R+ rating and think that your going to have a nosebleed every episode, when the fact is that you will not. Wait wait wait... an anime that is focused around one girl trying to have sex 100 times has to have major nosebleed moments in just about every episode. Well the fact is that it is pretty gimmicky and what you will find is annearly perfect romance plot and a whole lot of funny moments packed into 12 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot/story gets a 10/10. The reasons for this is because while in the first couple episodes Yamada (the main girl lead) is set to bust her v card and have sex with 100 guys but it soon turns into something else. The formula is great and it's a great mix-up on how the conflict changes.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art gets a 9/10. It has clean, crisp, and excellent visuals that you would expect an anime to have for now on. It's nothing revolutionary but there is no flaws. Next is the sound which gets 9/10. Opening and the closing songs sound great and catchy. I watched the English dub episodes and i don't have a single complaint any of the voice actors. Each piece of music fit in with that given scenario. And again like the art it wasn't nothing revolutionary but i had no complaints.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters get another 9/10. It has it's share of stock characters and each character from kosuda to yamada to kanejou to chika each of them were a joy to see and learn about.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment is most defiantly a 10/10 i mean hell i wish i could give it a 11/10. So funny. Great Romance. Great plot. Everything is just enjoyable and great.\\n\\n\r\nTo rap up i think b gata h kei is the best romance anime that i have ever watched (and i have seen a lot of them). If your just about to watch this anime just for the ecchi than don't because there is only about 2-3 scenes where there is nudity. This is a must watch for a romance and comedy guy or gal.-Dennis",

            "content": "Hi! Robert's Too Late Review coming at you! Be sure to check the synopsis, and of note I am discussing the dub version. Minor spoilers might slip through, but I do my best to prevent that. B-gata H-kei is a really interesting anime, so we're going to take some time to discuss just exactly why this is the case. Will Yamada make the RTLR lost wall? Let's check it out!\r\nStory: 8\r\nI will say this, as a father and uncle, I don't think I would be real happy to hear that my loved one had decided that their goal is to sleep with a hundred peoplebefore graduating high school. That doesn't mean it's not a good premise for the story, as it's a great one. Going beyond the synopsis (which you read, right?) we have an absolute train wreck of a girl trying to become, well, *very* experienced in sex. The problem is she's the most awkward person I've seen since myself when it comes to dealing with the opposite sex. She overlooks the fact that guys in this show fawn over her, to the point she's considered one of the prettiest girls in school. But because of her shyness towards guys she's determined to lose her virginity to another virgin. If she would just drop this plan of conquest, there are a number of guys that seem more than willing to get down with her, yet she only has eyes for Kosuda. \\n\\n\r\nShe becomes incredibly embarrassed at the smallest thing, which always seemed to ruin the sexy thing she's planning to do in her mind, often to hilarious levels. She comes across as brash, and most of the time confuses Kosuda to no end. Her getting flustered and angry is a blast to watch as I've met girls like that in my life, and have been a guy that kind of pulled some the same stunts when I was young, though never to Yamada's extent. All the while a beautiful love story is unfolding before our eyes, and we see that Yamada does have thoughts besides getting laid, no matter what her 'sex spirit' tells her. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI really liked the art in this one, Yamada herself is well drawn, and is as cute as all get-out. I especially love the hearts scene in the opening theme. The large chested side characters, ahem, seem to 'bounce' appropriately. The art reflects the mood very well, when Yamada is finally able to come close to intimacy, the art actually makes her look alluring. (for an anime, don't look at me that way!) Otherwise, we have lots of funny anime tropes, the normal comedy type action, like yelling with a big head, the over drawn eyes and things like that if you've seen one anime before, you are likely already familiar with. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nOkay, first off, Brittney Karbowski voices Yamada herself in the English dub, and that woman is one of my all time favorite voice actors, so of course I'm quite pleased with how she sounds. She brings femininity to the role. No sounding like Blackstar for sure. Kosuda has a good 'shy, clueless boy' sound to him, and the music is well done. I particularly like the opening song, and will listen to it without watching the rest of the show. Fitting silly sounds are also present, such as a squishy type sound when Kosuda accidentally pokes Yamada's breats, or what have you. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nYamada is great in that she brags to her friends about how sexually active she is, or at least how skilled at romance, and then when she has a chance to move in on Kosuda she falls flat on her face, often snapping at him or yelling instead of trying to seduce him. Kosuda is charmingly clueless, second guessing every single thing that Yamada does to show her growing affection for him. The pair together, awkward girl and clueless boy works well and leads to many funny situations for the couple. There are sub plots including a girl who finds herself perfect, and has one CREEPY obsession. She tries to move against Yamada, giving her a bit of a romantic rival. The other sub plots are fairly well done, though I felt sorry for the young lady crushing on Kosuda, as she never had a chance. Overall the characters are not too surprising, but just enough to keep my attention, and keep me laughing. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI will spin this anime when I'm looking for something to watch and don't feel like anything new. It's a cute show that remains enjoyable even after a couple of replays. I never thought I'd root for someone else to get laid as much as I did these two. There was never any question if they would, it was more how they were going to overcome their own personal issues to get there. In the time it takes for that to happen, they both come to realize they are feeling more feelings than just hormonal sex drives. What starts as nothing more than the opening (sex) shot of Yamada's crusade of conquest becomes something much more. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to anyone that is mature enough to understand the dynamics of relationships, but young enough to remember how awkward talking to the opposite sex could be back in the day. In the end, the story is sweet and funny, and worth the price of admission. As for the RTLR wall, Yamada scored two separate spots because I had so much fun watching her fall flat on her face every time she tried to be smooth. I feel her pain, for sure. Enjoy!",

            "content": "B Gata H Kei Review\r\nThis is gonna get ugly\u2026 read the summary below if you want a shorter, condensed version of my thoughts.\r\nSummary:\r\nThere\u2019s no way of getting around it\u2026 this anime is bad and I despise it. Why? Bland story with some potential in the premise squandered by insufferable/bland characters. The music and animation is decent, but hardly anything memorable. Enjoyment was incredibly low, making me hate this anime the more I thought about it. What really made me despise this anime was its characters. B Gata made it\u2019s main heroine too whiny, arrogant, demanding and such with little self awareness or development. Yamada\u2019s shallowgoals aren\u2019t the problem, but they failed to make her sympathetic enough to care about her. Her love interest is even worse, suffering from incredible blandness and is about as lively as roadkill perched on a rotting plank of wood. This was an ecchi looking to set itself apart from others in its genre and fell flat in many aspects. Overall: 3/10. \\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nThe premise here is unique (I never heard a premise like this, anyway): have a adolescent girl lusting for sex, straying away from many of the norms/cliches of typical romance/ecchi anime. It purposefully portrayed it\u2019s main character as a sex crazed bimbo. Unfortunately, it did this too well. The issue isn\u2019t the end but the way they portrayed the means. The story and pacing backfired in making its characters vulnerable or sympathetic and rather painted them in a negative light far too often. The atmosphere and mood tries to convey melodrama, but it often just heightens the idiocy and hostile behaviors of characters. It desperately needed to show these characters being more vulnerable and honest instead of annoying and irrationally immature. Overall: 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nI know this may sound like a broken record, but it seriously can\u2019t be overstated how much I hate Yamada. There is a right way to do obnoxious and bitchy characters who eventually change and become much more likable. Taiga Aisaka is one of the best examples I can think of. What made her an excellent character and is missing here is how her friends, and own personal feelings made her grow strong, kinder and more mature. This is what Yamada needs. Instead, we get 10+ episodes of Yamada being INCREDIBLY obnoxious, Yamada\u2019s friends telling her how fucking awful her behavior is and NOTHING being done about it on her end, forcing her will onto others without any hint of self awareness or empathy\u2026 ugh. I can easily write an entire essay on how much contempt I have for Yamada, but if you are going to make a character who has morally wrong or bankrupt goals, that\u2019s fine. The thing is... you can\u2019t expect the audience to give a shit when you want to show her softer/slightly more likable side AT THE END OF THE ANIME!\\n\\n\r\nSadly, there\u2019s someone even worse from a character standpoint: her boyfriend/slave Takashi. The only thing I can think of that\u2019s worse than making a character insufferable is making them BORING AS HELL. Why is he so boring? Because we know nearly nothing about him, he goes along with every horrible action Yamada does with no rebuttal to anything she says/does, he has less backbone than a jellyfish and just kinda is\u2026 there. He is treated as a means to an end because of the premise. However, when they try to actually develop a romance out of this\u2026 they forgot to actually develop his character. All I can really remember is that Takashi is a photographer\u2026 THAT'S IT. Seriously, I have seen fewer wooden expressions from a ventriloquist dummy. The only other character left talking about is Yamada\u2019s best friend. All she does is point out the obvious and is the only \u201cok\u201d character in this. There really isn\u2019t anyone else to talk about. The characters are EASILY the worst part of this entire shitshow. Overall: 1/10.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nI combined these two in one because neither were particularly memorable. The animation was pretty decent and i\u2019ll be damned if I could remember anything from the soundtrack or openings. I have nothing much to say here because it was fairly forgettable. I will give some props to the animation and the voice acting as neither was particularly bad or wretched. Overall: 5/10. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThe real question is where IS the enjoyment in this?! I\u2019m fully aware that art is subjective but I could not for the life of me see WHY people rate this so highly and like this so much. I won\u2019t beat a dead horse with my criticisms but I will say that I love romance, drama and even high school anime in general. As much as it can be cliche, same-y and boring, there are many romantic dramas set in high schools that show how great this genre is (SNAFU, Toradora, Shigatsu, first season of Clannad, Dengeki Daisy\u2026 the list goes on). Even if I am not someone who usually seeks out ecchi anime or manga, there\u2019s a better way to do anime/manga in that genre. How? This is how: developing characters properly by showing the bad AND the good, having erotic and the not erotic scenes that helps flesh out character\u2019s development, and most importantly getting your audience to feel empathetic by showing character imperfections with a sense of self awareness or having other characters help them become kinder. That is what B Gata needed and it failed miserably. Overall: 2/10. \\n\\n\r\nPros: \\n\\n\r\n+ Uh\u2026 the animation and sound didn\u2019t send me into a fit of rage and was serviceable\u2026?\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n- Yamada (EVERYTHING)\\n\r\n- Takashi, the living mannequin and vacuum of character development\\n\r\n- Abysmal character development that had to rush to the end to try and   redeem its characters. Needless to say, it fell on it\u2019s face\\n\r\n- ALMOST NOTHING WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY THE TIME IT ENDED \\n\r\n- When it wasn\u2019t being infuriating, it was just boring to sit through and was painfully unfunny\\n\\n",

When i started this anime i thought it would really take you into only sex every episode but when i watched more episodes i found out that this anime actually has a great evolving love story. Both are shy characters that are really good persons which the girl doesnt show that much but i did certainly like the part of her trying to get away with actually really loving someone while it wasnt her goal. When this serie ended i knew for surethat you should watch this anime not only for the part of ecchi but also for the great love story which evolves every episode in a great way. The characters are really good and the story is also a great one. i really enjoyed this anime mosly because of its love story and i do recommend this one for people that like good evolving love story's.",

            "content": "ENJOYMENT: [10/10]\r\nI\u2019ll start off with enjoyment since B Gata H Kei isn\u2019t a Great Anime by any means. You can\u2019t compare it to stuff like FMA: B or even to highly touted titles in its own category, such as Clannad. This is simply because BGHK aims for a unique type of cognitive dissonance. (What is this term he throws out there? \r\nTL;DR - the discomfort one experiences when holding conflicting ideals simultaneously. This leads to feelings of embarrassment, shame, etc.\r\nTL;DR 2 \u2013 BGHK is about the dissonance between sex without love, love without sex, and just plain sex after all. )\r\nTL;DR 3 \u2013 In deemphasizingthe love part of a romance, BGHK actually outdoes many \u2018stereotypical\u2019 romance/eroge adaptations by turning the ultimate sex goal into its own quirky, endearing romance by the end, and you realize that BGHK is not a bad rom/com in its own right from the very beginning.\\n\r\nThat\u2019s right, I bring out cognitive dissonance as what drives BGHK into its own tier of anime pleasure. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: [8/10]\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not a bad story, but the reason why it\u2019s \u201cjust normal\u201d is that aside from the unique premise of our heroine\u2019s goal of finding 100 sex partners while in school, the anime proceeds in a episodic slice of life fashion, which while enjoyable, is just that. Well done standard story that follows up logically on the premise.\\n\r\nYou\u2019ve got your somewhat tsunderish Yamada whose attempts to get fellow virgin Kosuda into bed is complicated by a mutual dissonance. The beauty of their interaction is that while the story throws you your usual rom/com plot twists inevitably brought on by entertaining screw-ups by one or both parties, each sides\u2019 beliefs about the other party are frequently and hilariously wrong or misguided. The story works fantastic when these mutual differences of opinion are explicitly voiced by the inner voices of both characters. \\n\r\nWhile it is an ecchi comedy, it\u2019s surprisingly clean about it and genuinely funny. That\u2019s a rarity nowadays.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: [8/10]\\n\r\nOn the one hand, the characters fit into broad stereotypes. Yamada is a tsundere. Kosuda is your average dude. But that\u2019s where stereotypes stop. The difference here is that Yamada, Kosuda, and most of the other characters in the show have \u201cInner Voices\u201d that act as a 3rd person dramatic aside that often underscores the irony of the situations the characters find themselves in. \\n\r\nYamada is a true tsundere in outer appearance, she can\u2019t comprehend her attraction to Kosuda, and acts accordingly. Kosuda acts like your average dude when confronted in this situation, \u201cWTF is going on! I can\u2019t understand girls.\u201d \\n\r\nHowever, as Yamada\u2019s goal is straightforward and necessary to her, TO HAVE SEX, LOTS OF SEX, she pursues Kosuda with a relentless ferocity that you don\u2019t see much if at all in rom/coms, but because they\u2019re both virgins, they can \u201cnever\u201d get the deed done properly.\\n\r\nMuch of the hilarity from this show ensues when Yamada and Kosuda fundamentally misunderstand each other. Does she really like me? What if he\u2019s confused by my vagina\u2019s appearance? What\u2019s going on inside her mind, is she really perverted and wants me? What\u2019s the matter, why doesn\u2019t he want the most beautiful girl in school? Is he gay?\\n\r\nOf course you also have your essential backing characters that often are foils to Yamada, and/or occasionally Kosuda. \\n\r\nAppropriately the ending concludes some basic questions about their relationship and raises the possibility of a second season.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: [7/10]\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t really find anything that stood out or detracted from the watching. Everything was animated smoothly and character models looked like they were done on an appropriate budget. The character designs fit the descriptions and the various expressions to illustrate shock, embarrassment, etc, are done well.\\n\r\nYamada is appropriately cute, and Kosuda, unmistakably normal.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: [7/10]\\n\r\nAgain, nothing stood out or detracted.\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nAs one reviewer said, this was probably one of the classiest ecchi rom/coms I\u2019ve ever seen. The fanservice was there but not gratuitous, in fact, it was surprisingly clean. In addition, what truly makes BGHK a great show for pure enjoyment is that it develops into a great rom/com when in the beginning, you may be turned off by the initial premise. The characters are great, their conflicts hilarious, misunderstandings even better, and this show, just a blast to watch.\\n\\n\\n",

I don't think I've ever found an anime as funny as this one and it's not easy to translate comedy from one language/culture to another.  Luckily, sex and 15 year old girls are the same the world over.  \r\nThis is one of those rare cases where the anime is markedly better than the manga, and where the English version is more enjoyable than the subs.  Again, I think this is because of the difficulty translating comedy.  Funimation may not have translated every wordliterally, but the effect they acheived is hilarious and, I'd bet, pretty close to the spirit of the original.  I heartily recommend this piece if you are or know a 15 year old girl.  It's quite frank and open about sexuality, though the manga is even more so!, but it never strays into crude and it's always funny.  I would call it a solid PG13 in the American system.  A definite must watch!",

I'm more than just familiar with your typical ecchi/romance (or if some of u would consider it harem) anime, but for me this anime was something really different. The storyline was very unique with the main character being a \"H\" girl instead of a guy, and i really loved the way they developed the characters in the story.Although the art and animation quality to me would be considered average for anime of these days, the story was nicely developed from how it slowly moved fromYamada just wanting to achieve 100 sex friends to her later realizing that she had feelings for Kosuda, with there being some touching scenes between the two of them (to me at least). Also, this anime was one of those that i enjoyed the most with me literally laughing out loud about half of the time while watching it. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, i would gladly give this anime a rating of 10 (just my personal opinion) for the great and unique story as well as characters, and also for the laughter and enjoyment experienced while watching. A great tool for de-stressing, i would say. and i would really hope for a second season to this anime or i would be really disappointed. Thanks for reading!",

            "content": "Possible Spoiler:\r\nMy score is high but is a little biased (also I'm a just a huge fan of Ecchi in general so this is really my cup of tea). I watched this anime for the first time around September 2012 and it was the first anime I ever watched. My friend and I binged it until 5 o'clock in the morning laughing our asses off. At this point my anime knowledge was pretty mediocre and I was just introducing myself to it so that may be why my thoughts on this show was so high. I decided to re-watch it and changed my thoughts alittle bit.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory (7):\\n\r\nTo be honest, the plot point of the story was pretty interesting and it would have been a lot better had the plot been carried through. I guess it was sort of supposed to be that way as it was showing how a girl infatuated with the concept of having sex with 100 guys in her high school fell in love with, really, a boring looking guy. I just felt the story dragged a little.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8):\\n\r\nI am very particular when it comes to art and B-gata H-Kei met my standards pretty well. Though all the scenes aren't as detailed as others, it is still a nice style to look at and appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10):\\n\r\nI am warning everyone that this theme song will be stuck in your head for years. You will be taking some important exam and all of a sudden you'll be humming \"kiss me baby\" and forget what you were doing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6):\\n\r\nYamada and Kosuda never have that \"breakthrough\" moment that makes you truly appreciate their character. I am pretty sure Miyano had showed more through her \"breakthrough\" then the two did in the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10):\\n\r\nIf I could rate this higher I would. Though, it isn't as good as the first time I watched it, I still laughed and cringed at the painfully awkward moments that appeared.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end, I realized when I rated this a 9 the first time I was not completely wrong and this anime isn't complete shit. I enjoyed almost every second of watching it and I highly recommend it!",

I mean they managed to tease and hit the right spots a few times but then at other times I feel they just could not get me off completely.\\n\\n\r\nTranslation: You actually are interested in seeing what these characters are up to but in the End, you feel it's kind of absolutely lead to nowhere and nothing has been resolved.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe designs are kind of bland, Granted I'm not expecting a Sex Comedy to have high quality animation, but at times you just wish they could have added a little more effort.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI watched this in English, I have to say I was pretty pleased with the vocal performances of Brittney Karbowski and Scott Freeman, It never once felt like they were acting and I got completely into what their characters were doing. Cherami Leigh also deserves a shout out for her convincing voice of reason portrayal.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nIt's all about the characters, I personally loved Yamada and Kosuda and liked seeing what was going to happen to them, when a series makes you care about the characters on screen you know it's done something right.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI think I was satisfied right up until the end where I was kind of let down.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nA great experience, This is what all ecchi shows should aspire to be, except with maybe a slightly better story.\\n",

A young girl wanting 100 lovers is kinda extreme for me but I decided to give the first episode a try. I did get a good laugh at the episode and seeing Kosuda reminded me of other male leads in anime that were just like him. Also, much like my other anime loving compatriots, when we start watching an anime we gotta finish it and I am glad I watched till the end.\r\nThe thing about this animeI liked the most was the art, it was very well done and I applaud the artists who put time and effort into making good artwork. The comedy reminded me a lot of other harem anime even though I don't think this anime qualifies as harem.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed the anime but there were some parts that went beyond the line for me and I won't say due to spoilers. I would also like to see an OVA or second season because I think they could do more with this anime.",

At first after reading the premise of this anime I was spectacle and unsure if its worth my time but it surely was!\r\nFan service, which I thought would be present in every frame is minimal, leaving out the first and the last few episodes. It doesn't feel like the show is teasing you but wants you to immerse and feel the feelings of Yamada itself. \r\n....:::Story:::.... 6\r\nThe story is nothing special, its about a girl who wants to get laid! Seriously!\r\nand have 100 sex friends,but she couldn't talk to even one. There is no plot as such, the show features the daily life of our main character Yamada as she stumbles upon a guy Kosuda in  a departmental store. And thus she begins to hit on him to fulfil her dreams. \\n\\n\r\n                                               MINOR SPOILER \\n\\n\r\n\"There is a hint that she might develop feelings for Kosuda, which may or may not happen in future \" \\n\\n\r\n....:::ART:::.... 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art is generic but has vivid colours so its pleasing to watch. There are no quality drops and the show is quite good looking with smooth animations.\\n\r\nNothing much to  say here.\\n\\n\r\n....:::Sound:::.... 8\\n\\n\r\nThe background musics does not really stand out but the opening and ending \\n\r\ntheme are quite good and catching. \\n\\n\r\n...:::Character:::.... 8\\n\\n\r\nThis is where my opinions might be different from the rest, though there is \\n\r\ncharacter development but it feels unaccomplished. For instance lets say Yamada starts from block 1, at the end of the show she moves to maybe block 2 and that's it. It feels like she accomplished nothing but that doesn't take away from the show too much.\\n\r\nTalking about characters....\\n\r\nYamada is a really likeable character and you would really love her. On one hand she is bold, daring and outspoken but at the same time she is averse and hesitant, which makes her personality stand out.\\n\\n\r\n....:::Enjoyment:::.... 10\\n\\n\r\nBoy! I really liked the show, the jokes were incredibly funny and it had the sense of completion, I didn't felt that the show was short or incomplete, the ending was perfect. just leaving of the Character Development part. \\n\\n\r\nOverall B Gata H Kei is a awesome show.  though it has minor hiccups but still it manages itself well.\\n\r\nRecommended!  \\n\r\n(8/10)\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Hey, you're a virgin, right?\"\r\nWhat kind of person would you have to be to ask someone that after they met in a bookstore for the first time, right after a glance at them?\r\nHearing this and reading the brief description of a girl who wants to have sex with 100 people nets you a vision of probably the most explicit ecchi anime ever, and, if you didn't know better, you would think that this was actually a hentai. Well that's just WRONG.\r\nThis anime is actually just a cute little romance between two people who have absolutely no experience in love. It's this story of trying tocreate a functional relationship, with lots of humorous mistakes along the way . It's a story of chasing a goal that you have no idea how to reach, that others think you can't reach, yet you still try to reach it, despite your doubts, and fight towards this goal with everything that you can muster, trying to ignore failures along the way.\\n\\n\r\nThis is our Yamada (given name withheld), an incredibly beautiful girl who is, rather unbelievably, a virgin. And she has to search out a fellow virgin to rid her of the curse of a looking strange \"down there\". So, now, we only have one problem: how can we get Kosuda (the male lead and fellow virgin) to sleep with her?\\n\\n\r\nWell, we run into the problem from which most of the hilarity in this show emerges: neither Yamada nor Kosuda know a thing about sex, and are both completely incompetent and very embarrassed when dealing with the topic.\\n\\n\r\nThese two obviously aren't our only characters. We have a large supporting cast who serves to add to the humor of the show, although they aren't very good at their job. This cast often fails to add a significant amount of humor, and, unfortunately, for a good portion of the show, almost all of the humor emerges from the interactions between the two leads, although there is still a fair amount of humor that emerges from the interactions with the supporting cast, and this grows as the show continues and new characters are introduced.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in  this show is really quite cute and compliments the overall cute nature of the story. It's not a perfect attention to detail, or anything of that level, but out is still a very cutesy art style, that never really feels out of place, and allows for you to feel at home with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting and songs also fit this image perfectly, with each character being matched perfectly with a voice that would match their characters, from a falsely superior voice for Yamada to a dopy voice for Kosuda, to a perfectly seductive voice for the opening. The Sound is quite superb, and one of the strongest points of this anime\\n\\n\r\nI also have the unfortunate duty of reporting shortcomings in this show. One I already mentioned is the lack of humor emerging from the supporting cast. Another minor problem I have with this show is it was not always extremely humorous. Some episodes were slightly boring or simply to painful to watch in one sitting. That being said, both of these objections were remedied as the series approached the ending; there was constant humor and it was often brought out by the supporting cast.\\n\\n\r\nSo ,in summary, B Gata H Kei was indeed a very good anime; it brought out humor in all situations, even turning relatively serious problems into big jokes and it got better as it went along. I strongly recommend that you watch in at least a few episodes before considering dropping it. \\n\\n\r\nFarewell, B Gata H Kei, or as I have also heard, The B-cupped Slut. I will seriously miss your udder ridiculousness.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. This is my first review, so I apologize if I did something wrong :)",

            "content": "Honestly - I like this anime. It just turned out to be a leveled-up romance-comedy series with all those perverted thoughts and scenes. In my opinion, it's not really that much of a hentai, well, compared to Sekirei. It's just an anime full of perverted thoughts, humongous boobs, comedy, and the vain love of the girls.\r\n\tI should say, the concept is pretty good. The plot is well-arranged too, and the pervertness is balanced out with the comedy. It's also good that the main characters are all dense rather than just only a character being one.\r\n\tThe drawing is pretty good too. Kosuda's as-if-he-is-not-the-main-character look is arefreshment, considering that almost all anime have bishies as main character. Well, the big boobs are still bothering me though. How can one get a natural G cup anyway?\\n\r\n\tAnyways, it's good that the mangaka substituted \"the thing down there\" and \"libido\" with an erogami or the characters' chibi-fied self rather than drawing the real thing or do the traditional covering of it. It added to the comedy and broke the usual way.\\n\r\n\tI really find the theme songs very cute and sweet, thanks to Yukari Tamura's cute voice. They also fit the anime, or so I guess. And the \"B Gata H Kei\" song that is always  present when there's a perverted scene is also quite good.\\n\r\n\tI guess this anime is an 8.7 out of 10 for me. I recommmend this to the perverted bored ones there who don't mind soft ecchi. Well then, off I go.",

            "content": "Unlike many people, I was unaware of the premise of this series before I started watching this it.  I just went off the English title: Yamada's First Time.  The image painted in my mind was this cute, blonde, high-school girl, discovering herself with the boy-next-door.  Within the first minute of the show, all my expectations were blown out the window.\r\nThe series itself is build on the fact that Yamada wants to have 100 sexual partners before graduating high school.  WHAT???  That's awesome.  Pretty girls want that too!!!  The concept is amazing and the events that unfold before herdraw the veiwer in quickly.  She is cute, confident, smart, and lusts after the opposite sex.  She's every highschool boy's fantasy come to life.  And this is certainly evident through her unparelled popularity and the fact that she is singlehandedly the only topic that \"the guys\" talk about.  However, even though she knows she is beautiful and desirable, she is still self-conscious about certain parts of her body (wink wink) and has no knowledge of sexual acts or how to seduce guys.  With these ingrediants, B Gata H Kei formulates a hiliarious 12 epiosde series that many people can relate too.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters, Kosuda, Yamada's first conquest, is a very standard, cliched, high school boy.  He thinks about sex all the time, but has no experiance.  He is somewhat shy around pretty girls, but has no difficulty interacting them.  He over-thinks things which should be blatently obvious.  He has \"geeky\" hobbies, and lives a very normal life.\\n\\n\r\nYamada on the other hand, is a very attractive, outspoken girl with a single track mind.  Getting her cherry popped.  She has no filter when speaking and says exactly what she is thinking.  She has no tact or \"morales\" and wants what she wants, when she wants it.  All this being said, she does not exactly know how to get what she wants, so she bumbles through, and hope her actions result positively.\\n\\n\r\nThe interaction between these two character will no doubt make you laugh.  The up-to-date dialogue used thoughout the series speaks volumes for the youthfulness of the writers.  I literally grinned the entire series and laughed so hard I rewound parts to watch them again.  And though the adolsent jibbing was the most enjoyable part of the series for me, the love story was just as beautifully done.  Never, in my viewing history, have I ever hoped that two people would \"hook-up\".  I always hope for the underdog to get the princess, and Kosuda/Yamada fit these roles to a tee.\\n\\n\r\nThe art throughout is clean and stylized.  Using classic beiges and black for school uniforms was a nice choice, and the characters all look very good in both school uniforms and regular street clothes too.  The background animation was spectacular and detailed, and brings out the true beauty surrounding the story.  \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED song choices were both upbeat pop songs and set the mood for series wonderfully.  Never once did I skip over them, but instead allowed myself to get excited for the events in which to come.  The BGM was unmemorable, but certainly at the time captured the mood perfectly.  But for sound, what takes the cake was the English voice acting.  These roles were done flawlessly.  Not just our leads mind you, but all the supporting characters sounded exactly the way you would think they should sound.\\n\\n\r\nIf someone asked me to name something I didn't like about this series, I would slap them across the face and say, \"how dare you?\"  This series had everything I could want.  Beautiful art and smooth animation, a slight dose of \"classy\" fanservice, a VERY unique storyline, and characters you get excited for.  Guys will no doubt love it for the boob and panty shots and the fact that we hope for the \"nerd\", and girls will like it for the love story and silly situations our characters get themselves into.  Doubt me, watch for yourself.",

            "content": "Yamada's First Time, oh wow, what a show. I started watching this series after I heard that children's mothers were upset and were trying to argue that this show was \"smut\" teaching their teens to want to go out and sleep with a bunch of people. Within the first minute of the show you are introduced to what this show is all about: teenagers not understanding members of the opposite gender, and a lot of teens misconceptions about sexuality and intimacy. It is truly relatable and hilarious to watch many of these scenarios crash and burn in this series and it reminds me of whenI was a teenage boy who was scared to even talk to a girl. The gags keep coming fast and furious in this series as Yamada discusses her overwhelming desire for intercourse with her inner self manifested into a mini Yamada on her shoulder as well as her sister and close friend. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like animes with nonstop awkward teens interacting with each other in hilarious scenarios as well as constant jokes and discussions about naughtiness then you will utterly love this series. If you like to play your sexuality a little closer to the belt though, ala in a more discrete and less obvious way then you will probably hate everything this show represents and then some. I laughed out loud on multiple ocassions during this show and the entertainment value is a big determinant as to whether I appreciate shows of this nature or not.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint is a small spoiler. The end of the show definitely teases future antics that are never shown which is understandable since this is not a hentai but more of a journey of maturation for Yamada. I also wish that we got to see other characters interact with their significant others more since it would have added another perspective and dynamic to the show. Only one other recurring character is shown as having a boyfriend which out of the numerous characters introduced definitely seemed a bit odd to me.",

            "content": "Summary: Since you mofos love summaries so much, and I actually really want as much people as possible to watch this anime, here's the summary. \r\n  Yamada, first name withheld, is a perverted girl who's ultimate dream goal is 100 sex friends! She's prepared everything, her body, the condoms (yes the condoms), her style, her fashion... except... there's just one thing missing. Yamada is overly self - conscious that she's a virign and thinks her vagina's weird. Yes, this is the anime you are going to dive into. \r\n  Due to this, she try to finds a fellow virgin to assist her inlosing her virginity, and comes across Kosuda, a, you guess it, fellow virgin. Watch these two and how they interact through 12 episodes of, holy Jesus this anime was funny just watch it already.\\n\\n\r\nActual Review\\n\\n\r\nI don't even know where to start with this anime. I got a lot of work to do and this was such a great show, I'd rather not squander its name but I have to get this out to as much people as possible. This has got to be one of the most enjoyable animes that I have ever watched. Let's just use \"bullet points,\" I think this will make this review go faster and get to the point.\\n\\n\r\n- Comedic: This anime had a very comedic and humorous aspect to it. I do not recall a single episode having a scene I did not laugh at. It plays with the Ecchi (perverted) aspect of the show very well turning it into something comedic and enjoyable to watch. The show also has a good and natural flow to it. You know the animes where the comedy just feels too forced? This anime gets it comedic sense through how people interact with each other, it truly makes you like you're watching real life scenarios (dramatized a little of course) and no one can see you. \\n\\n\r\n- Ecchi!!: This anime doesn't hesitate to make fast progress, you know, those shows that give you a peck AT BEST towards the end. This anime gets straight to the point but has a good rhythm to it. Nothing feels rushed and nothing feels too slow, you feel like as if they're making good and sincere progress.\\n\\n\r\n- Love and the minds of the characters: All throughout the show, you get to hear what Yamada (girl protagonist) and Kosuda (male protagonist) are thinking, giving you a good insight into the minds of the people as they're in the situation. At the same time, they do it so (again) naturally and normally that I didn't realize they were doing it until I had finished the show. It gives a nice element to the show, comedic, realistic, and a good insight into what the two were thinking at different moments. I applaud this aspect as not many generic romcoms dive into this, the most you'll get is a contrived and overtly emotional thought that's just too blatant and obvious. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show was just great and absolutely amazing to watch, very comedic, very humorous, very enjoyable. It does dive into the topic of sex frequently though, so if you're turned off by that kind of stuff it's better to stay away from this. It also has a nice story between these two, as an overlying outline for the whole story. The overall character development between the two were also outstandingly executed, however I sort of wish they dove into the lives of Kosuda and Yamada at the very least. However, I believe they wanted to keep the show at a comedic stand-point, none the less, I gave \"character\" a 9 for that reason and also I feel I might be too biased towards the anime. The content is great, the overall structure and plot for the anime was great, and most of all, it was incredibly enjoyable.",

            "content": "At the time that I watched it, B Gata H Kei was one of the most ecchi, borderline hentai series that I had seen (up there with Kiss X Sis and Yosuga no Sora). Obviously, newer shows have eclipsed even this, but not always in a good way... Despite the strongly-ecchi nature, they've made the show into an interesting comedy about a girl looking for sex buddies, and is yet still a virgin herself. As this is NOT a direct hentai, she is doomed to fail at her goal repeatedly in the show (though I guess they could have pulled a Yosuga no Sora...). Whatis surprising is that they were able to do all this while integrating a decent character development.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a good show if you're alright with occasional nudity and LOTS of fan service because of the portrayal and unique personalities of the characters. If you are easily offended by such NSFW scenes and the idea of a girl being a huntress, then maybe this isn't for you.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation is up to date in terms of quality. Character designs are good (typical good looking female lead with a mediocre guy) and colors are full but not over-saturated. Nudity and suggestive sexual acts (such as groping, fondling, rubbing, etc.) are pervasive in this series. The nudity is partially covered by a demon icon in the TV releases, which is removed for the blue rays. My only qualm would be the plain, simple backgrounds used in the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP is fairly good, a bit latin-y and a bit on the seductive side. The ED is a bit slower paced but also has a nice main melody. Both are sung by Yamada. The BGM is a bit distinctive in this series, heavily utilizing brass instruments, giving it a fun, flirtatious mood. Tamura Yukari does a great job on voicing Yamada (compare with Excel in Kurokami) giving her lots of energy and determination, the other VAs do a fine job but she's definitely the star in this.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nSo Yamada wants 100 sex buddies, but gets weirded out every time a guy approaches her. Therefore, she decides that her first \"victim\" must also be a virgin. Enter Kosuda, a ridiculously average looking dude that happens to meet all of Yamada's one criteria, he's a \"cherry boy\".\\n\\n\r\nThe story basically shows Yamada's attempts at approaching him and how the two eventually grow closer, despite uncountable numbers of misunderstandings and miscommunications. This is made even more fun due to Yamada's ego (wonder if most girls are like this) that prevents her from really ever being honest with Kosuda.\\n\\n\r\nUnderneath all the ecchiness, this is actually a fairly heartwarming story, think like those movies where a person is set up to \"date\" another person for money or on a dare, and actually end up liking them; this is one of those.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nYamada is easily one of the most entertaining characters in recent memory. You can tell what she wants but she won't ever say it directly. This combined with her seemingly unnatural sex drive makes her extremely impatient, especially when Kosuda doens't get her \"hints\", which often backfire and lead him to believe that she hates him. What is funny is that unlike many other harem series where the girl is just all over the guy all the time, Yamada is actually, realistically, hard to read.\\n\\n\r\nKosuda is a pretty bland character but you also have a very lively support group, including one of the first roles voiced by Mamiko Noto, where she isn't a timid, quiet person.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, the resulting character development between Yamada and Kosuda is absolutely great in this series, if only there was a bit more depth with the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThis was a very fun series to watch, not at work of course. You'll get a few laughs and wonder how this ended up on TV a few times as well. Then you ask yourself, would you really want to date a Yamada?",

            "content": "Wow, how do I even describe this series? Well, for starters, I had no idea it even existed until last week when a clip appeared on Funimations Youtube channel. I got curious and decided to watch said clip. Next thing I knew, I was looking for it on Netflix as advertised. Now, lets break this down, maybe that'll make it a bit easier to review without getting too cautious.\r\nWell, B Gata H Kei(B Gata H Kei: Yamada's First Time in English) is a story about a girl whose sole purpose in High School is to bang 100 guys by the time she graduates from HighSchool. The only problem is that she has yet to lose her V-Card and is worried that any experienced guy would think less of her for not being experienced. And that brings us to the main story as well as our main cherry boy. The lead characters are Yamada and Kosuda. Honestly? I've never seen a series with characters quite like this(Well, except Panty & Stocking...). As mentioned before, Yamada is a Freshman in High School with the goal of banging 100 guys. The problem is that she REALLY cares what people think of her. She's the most popular girl in the school and just about every guy would do anything to even  be acknowledged by her and would bang her in a heartbeat. Kosuda on the other hand seems to be the most oblivious guy in the world. Yamada falls on him in a book store and decides that he will be her first time since she assumes he also still has his V-Card, which is more or less true. This leads to total confusion on his end as he attempts to try and tell what she's thinking. Aside from those two, there are the Eros Deities. Yeah, Ero should really be all you need to read in order to know where that is going. The Eros Deities are chibi versions of the characters they follow around and constantly break the fourth wall in comedic fashion. Yamada's Eros Deity looks like a chibi version of her, but wearing a robe, holding a staff, and has a white mustache for some reason. Kosuda's Eros Deity is, as you can assume by now, a mini version of himself which is wearing a yukata. However, unlike Yamada's Eros Deity who is constantly pushing her towards getting laid and depressed when everything falls apart time and time again, Kosuda's Deity has absolutely no faith in him, and shows more often than not to express Kosuda's arousal. So more or less a living censor bar that talks. Which is actually pretty funny.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the premise of this series, Yamada wanting to get diddled, would make you think this is a hentai, it is in fact, not. So have no fears, you have absolutely nothing to worry about... well, except for the nude scenes which more or less turn this series into softcore porn. Normal late night television anime have been getting bolder and bolder as of late. This series more tame than High School DxD, but it does follow in those same ero footsteps. It's definitely tasteful, mature, and often times down right hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly really enjoyed this series and I found next to nothing wrong with it. I liked the romance between Yamada and Kosuda. It was expected yeah, but that's typically how romance series are. You know who is going to end up together, but you don't know how they'll get there. That's the beauty of new stories. But at the same time, B Gata H Kei makes its intentions known from the start and throws you into complete disarray with the whole absurdity of it. It keeps you coming back each episode to find out if anything actually happens. The premise is completely different by comparison to other romance animes and so it stands out from the pack. Now, do I recommend sitting down with your lover and watching this? Er... probably not. Your girlfriend/boyfriend may start wondering if you're staring at him/her or the animated character on the screen at times. And that typically doesn't end well. So I advise against that. And this is definitely a series that is 50/50 when trying to watch it with family. Definitely Rated PG-13, but your family might begin questioning you as to why you're watching an animated television show with rare, but beautifully drawn and animated nudity. Yes, I just praised the rare nudity. Got a problem?\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, I just loved the interactions between the characters and the music was great. Though, one of my main gripes was the rivalry between Yamada and Kanojo. Kanojo can't stand coming in second behind anyone. And while the rivalry had its moments and seemed good on paper... I almost felt like it didn't need to exist. I mean to each their own, but the series probably would've been fine without it. That's just my two cents though.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the dub was concerned, it was perfect. I didn't find any out of place voices and the fact that the actors were willing to say half the shit that they did made my jaw drop. I kind of almost want to compare the dub to the subtitles. Something practically tells me that half this shit was exclusive to the English Dub, and most likely the better for it to be honest. I'm just so glad that Funimation got the license. If Sentai had gotten it, the dub probably would have been mediocre and not even close to being as funny, and at the same time I'm glad Aniplex didn't get it because I really hate paying high prices for quality series. Funimation is a happy medium.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, and I really hope I didn't spoil anything for you and if I did I apologize heavily, B Gata H Kei was just the refreshing anime that I need to see. It wasn't flawless, but it damn well could have been. The characters are great, the music is nice, the art is very well done, the story was fantastic, and I really wish they had made a second season because 12 episodes is depressing. Yeah the story flowed great and ended on a great note, but you just know that there's still a whole 'nother year and half left of their High School careers. I wanna see what happens next and watch the hilarity ensue. Maybe I should become an Eros Deity in my spare time. Seems like a far more exciting job.",

            "content": "The story line of this anime is pretty unique if you ask me.  At first you might wonder how in the world can you make an anime that is about a girl that want's to have 100 sex friends, and yet at the same time you're not about to watch a hentai?!  Well it may seem confusing at first, but after a while you realize that the anime is actually more of a romantic / comedy.  The story quickly drifts away from 100 and focuses on the who will be the first.  \r\nNothing special about the artwork.  The only thingthat really stood out to me was how they censored things.  It was a big rectangle with a picture of a demon on it.  Which by the way is the same demon on the box of condoms in the show.\\n\\n\r\nOpening theme almost gives away what the story line is truly about.  The song seems to be long, but it is really the same thing said twice.  Decently catchy beat, but I often found myself ignoring the music and watching the back round because I found that more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOut of all the characters in the show only three have so called \"sex gods\".  These \"sex gods\" help narrate the story, and always have some kind of comment to say.  Usually negative comments about the character.  I would say about 1/4 of the anime is directed by the sex gods.  The main character Yamada is by far the biggest pervert in the show.  She always thinks about perverted things, and even if it is something that is not perverted she will think of a way to make it sexual in her mind.  The other characters don't have much that make them stand out as much as Yamada, so I won't talk about them.  (There is a certain someone that is also pretty weird but if I say more that might ruin the surprise)\\n\\n\r\nThis was a very good ecchi in my opinion.  I mean the main character is a girl, who thinks of nothing but sex, decently cute, loads of perverted things going on, on top of the fact that multiple girls like Kosuda (the main guy character).  What more could you ask for?",

            "content": "So i read the premise of this story, or the synopsis if you want to call it dat. *Smirk*\r\n*cough* It sounds pretty intelligent, interesting, and not sexual at all by any mean. (sarcasm)\r\nSo i just had to check it out you know? For no specific reason at all.  Btw, If you've never read the synopsis of this anime before... I'll make this short. Ahem...\r\nSo basically, we got a girl with the mindset of wanting to have 100 sex friend and that's her dream as of episode 1 of the anime. Despite how troubling it's to have to deal with 100 sex friend and keepyour relationship with them (I mean, some people take love seriously and may see sex friend as something intimate instead. Like love for instance). This anime is not really about acting like a slut in front of everyone that she meets. She herself is still very pure, and unadulterate despite how lewd, and pompous she is when it comes to her own beauty in the eyes of others. Tbh, i cringed when i first see the first episode. Not only did they choose the most dullest male love interest that will last for the rest of the episodes. He's one of those generic, loser-type of male love interest. This peeved me for just alittle just before i start realizing that he really does capable of doing something that most generic MC doesn't have the balls to do. Though, in a very \"idk wtf im doing\" sense. \\n\\n\r\nBut nonetheless, this anime has nothing to do with sex (tho there are ecchi, nudity and some foreplay in the last few eps) because of how inexperienced and shy, or tsundere our heroine is with pervy minds. The comedy of this series stem from that. But dont run away, or watch the anime with the single minded though that \"since the premise is fucked up\" i will go all feminism against it, or look at only the bizarre things that already has me despise the anime just because of the pervy female protagonist. Just watch it with disinterest (this word is not the same as uninterested). Tbh i have fun watching this anime. Plus i finish watching it within merely 4 days as i procrastinate from my studies, and my free time of doing something else, just to watch this fucking hilarious anime (tho cringey at first).\\n\\n\r\nAll that asides, this anime really have nothing to do with having sex with 100 + men, or seeing our female protagonist going all slutty and getting all the guys that she sees. It's less stupid, and sexual to the point that we could just call this a hentai like premises. However, the anime doesn't really move its story along those path. It actually went into the opposite direction, given that she suddenly experienced love with someone who she doesn't really expecting to fall in love with. Even though her true purpose was to have sex with someone, while it's a feeling that devoid of love, but self satisfaction only. She ended doing the exact opposite, so the central focus of the story is more like a love triangle like romance. \\n\\n\r\nAnd obviously, this anime isn't mean't to be watch by new anime watcher (unless they're a perv xd). If you don't to get too weird out. Try watching some generic, and less heavy, or sexual anime content first. Then slowly progresses to something abit more intense with its fanservice, and stupid as premises, with the same setting. But hey, this anime has some pretty entertaining comedy. Not in the aspect of its pervy jokes, or sexual implication or acts. It's just the desperate loli, comedy,and the relationship that's overall fun to watch. \\n\\n",

            "content": "The story of B Gata H Kei is about a girl who wants to \"bang 100 men.\" So you can already tell what kind of show this'll be: an ecchi anime for the perverts, comedy anime for those with bad tastes of humor, and a shitty slice of life that nothing ever progresses in until the end where they rush it. The pacing is meh, with every episode having its own little plot because it's episodic. The comedy never gets a proper punchline and the delivery is bad with the voice actors (for english dub watchers.) The jokes are told to be bold and funnybecause how ridiculous the situation during sex is, normally this would work, but the jokes are more slapstick humor than anything subtle. Instead of NHK's humor, where the Main Character uses a tissue when he finds something arousing, they don't go anywhere with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle is nothing special, but it adds nudity now. So mature, huh?\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design is nice and isn't noticeable, especially since this is a comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are bland and they don't get any real development, I can't see a damn change from Takashi. Yamada seems to be getting characterization like normal, but you really dislike her in the show. The ecchi fanservice ruins the pacing, but this is what I asked for so that makes the anime immune to criticism of fanservice now.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy anything as it had no real motivation to go anywhere. It was just a comedy that never appealed or was funny to me, comedy is subjective so watch the first 3 episodes and see for yourself. But I personally, disliked everything in this anime.",

            "content": "Before I get into anything, I want to let it be known that I love ecchi, so my opinions will come from a different angle than a lot of anime purists, which is okay. I really enjoyed B Gata H Kei. It's short, but extremely funny and filled with innuendo. Definitely worth a watch if you enjoy these types of anime, but stay away if you're the type that's easily offended by fan service or raunchy comedy.\r\nStory: The story is simple enough, the main character Yamada is a pervy girl who dreams of having tons of sex friends. Another way to say this is she'sthe hottest girl in school and her goal is to be a huge slut. The problem is that she's totally inexperienced, thinks her vagina looks funny, and doesn't want her first time to be with someone more experienced with her. As such, she bumps into what seems to be the most boring guy in the school, guesses correctly that he's a virgin, and makes him her first goal. \\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't really work out as she planned however, and the show quickly becomes a romance.  Each episode inches her closer and closer to her first time, but in true anime fashion is always cut short by some kind of ridiculous outside interference. In that regard, it's pretty stereotypical. However it's got a lot of comedic value to it, and I found myself laughing out loud plenty. While the premise of the show is pretty unique, it doesn't take itself too seriously either. \\n\\n\r\nMy biggest complaint is that the episode count doesn't seem nearly enough for the amount of time that passes. Due to almost every episode being some kind of holiday, something like a year and a half are covered in only 12 episodes. (SPOLER HERE) That's a year and a half of a romance consisting of 3 or 4 actual \"Dates\" involved, and I'm pretty sure it takes them a year to go from their first kiss to their second. (END SPOILER) The pacing is definitely off as far as that's concerned, and makes the whole thing feel a bit awkward.\\n\\n\r\n6/10 \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is actually really beautiful. The landscapes alone are fantastic. Character design ranged from outstanding, to generic, to bland - but all well drawn. I do feel that much of the generic or bland characters are drawn that way purposefully, as it's part of who they are (see: Kosuda). Still, it would have been nice to see at least some pizaz when it comes to the supporting cast.\\n\\n\r\n7/10 \\n\\n\r\nSound: Pretty average honestly, nothing that really stood out either positively or negatively. \\n\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are for the most part well done and full of personality. Yamada and Kusoda in particular develop really well, though admittedly they're basically the only ones who do. That's fine though, considering it's a short anime about a long romance between those two characters, who are explicitly inexperienced from the start. The characters do exactly what they're supposed to, fill whatever niche they need to (loli girl, tough teacher, wealthy rival, quiet nerdy girl with big boobs and glasses), but not much more than that.\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I definitely enjoyed this anime, it's funny in all the right ways, and full of light fan service. My only gripe other than what I've stated previously  is that for this type of show, waiting until episode 12 to show any nipples seems really weird. For an ecchi like this that relies so heavily on it's perverse theme, that seems like an odd choice to make. While it does make the few bare-breasted shots feel more impactful,  it's more jarring than anything. \\n\\n\r\nI understand going with no-nubs art style when you're trying like hell to push the line as far as it can go without being pushed into the 18+ section like Kiss X Sis, but there's nothing really that hardcore for the majority of the season that would make that a concern. It really doesn't do the show many favors to just add them in at the end like that, especially considering I had just watched 11 episodes without them and wasn't even thinking about it until I was reminded halfway in to episode 12. \\n\\n\r\nIt is still a great success as a comedy though, and having a pervy female main character trying like hell to get laid is new, exciting, and highly entertaining.\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I would definitely suggest this to anyone who enjoys comedy anime and isn't offended by sexual content in anime. It's not perfect, but it's amusing and unique, and in my opinion that's worth a watch. \\n\\n\r\n7/10",

            "content": "15 year-old Yamada enters High School with the ambitious dream of having 100 casual sex friends. Unfortunately, she has no idea about anything related to sex or romance at all! B Gata H Kei has all it takes to be one of the worst, most unbearably shameless shows of all time, but it is from this very context that B Gata H Kei is so impressive. In the face of the most cunning serpent of temptation, the show stuck to good writing and clever entertainment to offer its viewers a genuinely good time. Taken as good natured fun, B Gata H Kei is a greatexample of good main characters not being annoying as hell.\\n\\n\r\nMore identified with projects like Aria and sketchbook ~full colors~, HAL Film Maker is not known for ecchi love comedy. However, the professionalism and quality we've come to expect from the studio shines again in this show.\\n\\n\r\nB Gata H Kei is floated by its solid cast and watchable main characters. Yamada (cv. Yukari Tamura) is funny and likable. Her perverted, aggressive nature makes the show interesting and her naivete makes the show funny. There's a little boke/tsukommi routine going on with her friend Takeshita Miharu (cv. Horie Yui), who doesn't really have much other role in the show. Even considering this, Miharu delivers great comedy and is truly a great friend character. The male lead, Kosuda Takashi (cv. Abe Atsushi) is a meek and unconfident man because of how \"plain\" he looks. I feared another annoying passive male lead but much to my surprise, the character develops as the show progresses. It's not much, but in the context of these kinds of shows, holy crap.\\n\\n\r\nWhat kind of state is the genre in when two main protagonists not being one-dimensional douchetards is considered \"unique\"? But while Kosuda and Yamada are in denial of the relationship and everything, the annoying frustration never spills over in your face or ruins the fun. It's as if the two were \"It's complicated\" on Facebook but everyone knows what's going on anyways.\\n\\n\r\nKanejou Kyoka (cv. Kobayashi Yuu) is a good antagonist for this show. She's cruel and sinister while also being relatively funny. Her role in the show is surprisingly subdued, and though she was quite an interesting character, I don't mind too much. An often overlooked character in this show is Miyamo Miyu (cv. Hanezawa Kana), the shy osananajimi character who is innocent and naive, but has a crush on Takashi. She foils Yamada well and her helplessness is dialed up enough to make you kind of root for her, but not enough to be considered annoying. The conspicuous lack of a major love triangle between Yamada and Miyu keeps the show from turning into a pointless haremfest. A character I would liked to see more of, however, was Yamada's little sister, Chika (cv. Shimoda Asami). She would have been a nice contrasting character or served some good plot points. Misato Mimi (cv. Iwasaki Ai), the flat chested genkigal no one care about, is also a pretty good and memorable background character.\\n\\n\r\nAn overarching theme in B Gata H Kei is how surprisingly realistic the show seems. You'd imagine a show with a predatory female lead and an antagonist with a mansion on top of a mansion would have absolutely absurd, but so much of the core actions of the plot seem natural. Yamada and Kosuda develop as character and the relationship, though awkward and full of pitfalls, is really fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nB Gata H Kei is surprisingly intelligent, uncannily funny, and truly entertaining. It does big things and small things well -- poking fun at the various institutions Japanese youth are familiar with, like the idea of liberal fornication in love hotels to the overly strict homeroom teacher. The OP and ED are Yukari Tamura singles and are pretty tasteful and pleasant. No complaints about the art or animation, and I thought the character design was good to make characters look rather simple. The show is enjoyable to just sit back and watch as the characters bumble around strange situations. The fanservice is there but it's not trashy, tasteful even. I would actually say that the show probably needed more.",

            "content": "B Gata H Kei, or directly translated, \"B-cupped Slut\", is basically proof of the saying: \"Don't judge a book by it's cover\" (or description, in this case). Honestly, I was completely surprised by this anime. I decided to watch it purely because it seemed incredibly weird, and while I'm not going to deny that it is strange, it's a lot more than meets the eye. Don't be afraid, my friend. \r\nStory:\r\nUnique, for one. Finally someone addresses that females have sexual desire too. Yamada is horny as hell and not afraid to show it. So what does she do? Sets out to bang 100 dudes. Andwhile she might not get far in that goal, it's still really entertaining. I'm just warning you though, this is NOT a fanservice anime. In fact, there's practically none at all besides some bikini shots and 1 or 2 boob scenes. The only reason this is an ecchi is because of the topics it deals with, not because of porny images. So if you're looking for some jack-off material, skip this. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nPretty good. I don't really notice anime art unless it's really good or really bad, and ecchi anime are not known for their incredible animation. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSame as art, really. Background music didn't detract from any of the scenes, but it wasn't too memorable either. The op was... interesting. How is it possible to sing that high? Despite that, it was catchy and I never skipped it, lol.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAh yes, the shining category of this anime. Yamada is incredible, to say the least. And best of all, she's real. Never before have I seen a female character portrayed as horny realistically, yet this anime does it perfectly. Yamada is constantly coming up with schemes to seduce boys, which of course isn't that realistic, but the way she reacts when they work is. Deep down, Yamada is still a little unsure if she's ready to lose her virginity, a worry of all teenage girls. It can make her actions seem all the more strange, but any person who's ever been a teen will understand. She's relatable and funny. And best of all, she isn't over-sexualized.\\n\r\nHer victim, Kosuda, is also a good character. Unlike many other anime guys, there's really nothing incredible about him. He's average looking, awkward, and shy. Which is actually what the majority of teen boys are. By being such an average guy, it makes him all the more unique in the anime genre. He may also give some boys out there hope for scoring a pretty lady, haha. \\n\r\nThe other characters aren't focused on too much, but they all add to Kosuda and Yamada. Yamada's best friend is the voice of reason, helping her to see how ridiculous Yamada can be at times. Miyano and Kanejo, Yamada's rivals, are extreme opposites and very entertaining. Miyano is an extremely shy neighbor of Kosuda, and the only reason Yamada thinks she's a rival is because of her... well... enormous boobs. Kanejo, on the other hand, is obsessed with being the prettiest girl in their school and is constantly trying to dethrone Yamado. Hilarity ensues.\\n\r\nSide note on Kanejo: she's one of the only really fucked up things in this anime. She's... how do I say this? A fangirl of her own brother. She literally has a room filled with paraphernalia with his face on it. Not sure why this aspect of her was included, but it does make her less hate-able because you know how messed up she really is, lmao. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nImmense. The incredible cast, unique storyline, and great voice acting all add up to one of the most entertaining anime I've ever watched. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nB Gata H Kei is an anime I would recommend to any teen or young adult. It's relatable and well-written. It defies all stereotypes anime usually uses and instead creates a funny and honest comedy. Of course, it was probably broadcasted at 2 am in Japan, which is such a shame because this show is really for teens, not creepy otaku. I'm tempted to start a petition to use this anime in sex-ed. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. Going to warn you now, Yamada does NOT ever actually lose her virginity in this anime. If you want to see that happen, read the manga, which details all of Yamada and Kosuda's sexual adventures. ;)",

            "content": "One of the best things about this anime, other than it\u2019s sexually charged plot line, is the banter between each of the characters. Comedic timing in anime is typically a difficult thing to do, requiring the voice actor to not only be immersed in their role, but to have chemistry with other voice actors. Frequently in B Gata H Kei, the majority of the laughs not only come from the line the character is saying, but how the line is being said. One of my favorite things about this anime is that a well-timed one liner can come from almost any of the characters inthe scene. The best dialogue occurs between Yamada, and her best friend Miharu Takeshita. Their back-and-forth banter over Yamada\u2019s statements and motivations, each of them being justified in feeling so, never fails to deliver a chuckle. More humor can be found coming from Yamada\u2019s Eros Diety, who frequently \u201cbreaks the fourth wall\u201d to deliver a snarky rebuttal about Yamada\u2019s actions, or even Kosuda\u2019s big sister, who gives interesting backstory on Kosuda while at the same time subtly helping Yamada become closer in achieving her goal of sleeping with Kosuda.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the anime is very aesthetically appealing. Particularly, how the animation aids to the comedy. In one instance, Yamada is posing in her bathing suit in front of the mirror bragging about how nobody can resist her, and \u201cB-Cup\u201d flashed on the screen in referencing her boob size, which she wastes no time in punching it off screen. Or when she initially looks for Kosuda, but is too busy consumed by her thoughts to notice that he sits right next to her, a sarcastically drawn dashed line points directly to him. This style happens many times an episode, and entices as just many laughs as the characters, as they sometimes don\u2019t even have to speak for you to find humor in what\u2019s happening. What really stands out to me are the character designs, for as few characters that really matter for the majority of the episodes. Yamada\u2019s design of her fair colored skin, yellow sweater vest, and blonde hair with her blue eyes and blue accent colors makes her look equally as attractive to the viewer of the anime as she does other characters. Her design always keeps her as the center of attention, even if she isn\u2019t the scenes main focus. Takeshita\u2019s white and dark blue character design look equally as good, (maybe I have a soft spot for dark haired anime girls, who knows?) but doesn\u2019t take any attention off of Yamada. The same goes for Kosuda. He is in his school uniform the majority of the anime, looks plain and average enough to Yamada\u2019s eyes, yet his design is effective enough to be differentiated in a crowd from each of his other male classmates.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing and subsequent climax of each episode is what keeps you watching for hours on end. Each episode brings the same task as the last. Yamada needs to have sex with Kosuda. Period. With this motivation known, and repeated about 90 times an episode, you keep this in mind for scenes where the anime appears to veer off-course for a moment, when it appears that Yamada might be developing real feelings for Kosuda, or she pushes him away because she realizes that her approach has again failed her. As the scenes flow very well together, both Yamada and Kosuda build up their tension towards the climax and overall goal of the episode, whether it be Yamada wanting Kosuda to grab her breast in the dark film room, or each of them wanting to kiss in the local makeout park. And in those climaxes, the tension holds strikingly well. Between Yamada and Kosuda, we know what each character wants, and as each step they take on the ladder to sex fails, somehow you\u2019re still able to hold out hope that maybe, maybe, they\u2019ll get it together.  In those moments where those two do happen to reach that goal, for example kiss each other, their inner monologues both become focused on what they think the other thinks of what they\u2019re doing. This leaving many awkward moments for all of us figure out how they truly feel about what the other is actually doing. When they succeed, or end up on the same page, usually this ended with me throwing my arms up in triumph screaming \u201cyes! He touched her boobs!\u201d Yet their failures are also hysterical, as they have to start at square one the next episode, and have the most dramatic reactions to failure.\\n\\n\r\nMy one complaint about this anime is Kosuda. Not in a manner of  \u201cHe isn\u2019t good enough for Yamada!\u201d But Kosuda isn\u2019t as interesting as he feels he could be. Don\u2019t get me wrong, he\u2019s a very likeable character, and humorous in his own right. However it feels as if you plugged another awkward male into the role and gave him the daunting task of navigating thorough Yamada\u2019s mixed signals for 12 episodes, the results would be about the same. However, this anime isn\u2019t one to be taken too seriously, or seriously at all for that matter, so I can easily ignore this. Or this might be one issue that only I really care about, so feel free to discard this complaint.\\n",

We watch as she goes from just wanting to have sex as quickly as possible (and doing so in the most hilarious and clumsy ways) to falling in love with the last personin her class you would think she'd choose. \\n\\n\r\nB Gata H Kei has a slow to build romantic plot with a whole lot of comedy thrown into the mix. I found it a little refreshing to watch something this season that wasn't over the top ecchi/fanservice and actually gave me some laughs. This is a good series for people who don't want a serious romantic thrill; that will leave you rooting for the main characters to hurry up and do it at the end.",

            "content": "A cute teenage girl (who knows it, too) who dreams of sleeping with 100 guys, but worries about what she looks like naked and is hopelessly awkward when it comes to displaying affection?  Count me the hell in.\r\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\"B Gata H Kei,\" or \"Yamada's First Time\" is one of those shows that I initially went into not expecting much from, but emerged pleasantly surprised.  I came across it on Netflix one day and decided to queue it up with some friends, fully expecting to laugh at copious panty shots and anime boob physics.  What I got (along with the surprisingly minimal fanservice) wasan incredibly heartfelt, but still funny, story about teenage sexuality and the desire to be loved.\\n\\n\r\nStory:  7/10\\n\r\nThe premise itself isn't too hard to understand.  Yamada's goal has always been to sleep with 100 guys upon entering high school, but she wants he first time to be with another virgin.  She finds a totally plain guy (who she assumes is a virgin due to his plainness) and settles on him.  In the process f trying to seduce him, the two actually end up falling in love with each other.  This is undoubtably a storyline thats been done before, but with the roles reversed.  Seeing a teenage girl who is totally unapologetic about her sexuality is so, so rare.  It's unique as well as wonderfully empowering.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10 \\n\r\nI'm not sure how to describe it other than \"very 2010.\"  The style and colors all match up very closely with other 2010 anime.  It didn't really bring anything new to the table in those regards, but it definitely isn't bad, either.  The colors can be pretty bright and hard on the eyes at times, though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nWhile not bad, the sound is one of the weaker point of the show.  The opening and ending themes are quite generic and forgettable.  The background music, which is bubbly and upbeat most of the time, fits the series but is nothing noteworthy.  Netflix has the dubbed version, which I had no problem with, so I can't say I know much about the original voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nDefinitely the strongest point of the series.  Each character is very memorable, including the sideliest of side characters (shoutout to my main girl Misato).  Even Kosuda, who is the epitome of unimpressive anime guy, becomes interesting when he interacts with other characters.\\n\r\nOur titular character is definitely the strongest, with a firm personality, set of values, and goals.   Yamada is a great lead to the show, and wildly entertaining to follow.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nEven with such a simple and frankly juvenile concept, it's incredibly well-written and even though I often don't \"get\" Japanese humor, I found myself laughing out loud usually several times each episode.  I have a really hard to marathoning anime in one sitting, but if I was able to, this is one of those shows that I definitely would.  It's a fun and overall very sweet ride.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nI can understand why people would be wary of this show.  The cover art and description make it sound like a disgustingly sexualized story about a teenage girl.  The fanservice is definitely there (you get a full boob shot at one point), but it's always relevant in the context of what's happening and isn't distracting. With a character we don't see much of in other anime, it's unique and refreshing.  If you're not squeamish about the topic of sex, then this is a show that I would definitely recommend.",

I bought the Blu-Ray for this so i got to enjoy the Dub of this. And let me say it was what made the show. It used american slang which let me relate to the characters even more.\r\nStory - The story is about a girl who want to sleep with a 100 guys in high school. But she is insecure with her vagina and want to have her first with a cherry boy (virgin). She then starts to fall for him. (to behonest its a stupid plot)\\n\\n\r\nArt - When I looked at the cover and pictures of it I thought is was a copy and pasted characters design from a lot of animes, but when I started it I found myself loving the designs of Kosuda and a lot of the support characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound - I'll be honest I don't really pay attention to the music. But the opening song was really good in my opinion. The little B Gata H Kei note they repeated a lot was really good, and i found my self singing it whenever they said it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The characters were the best part about the show, and ill talk about my favortie ones\\n\r\n                  Kosuda - He was my favorite character in the show. He was really relatable and I found myself rooting for him\\n\r\n                  Yamda - She was a good main character but kind of a bitch in the beginning. Her unique personality gave me a lot of laughs though\\n\r\n                  The Ero Deitys - The little version of the main characters were hilarious providing some humor at serious moments, espicially Kosuda's\\n\r\n                  Kanejou - She was the stuck up cunt that was Yamada's rival.\\n\r\n                  Kazuki - Kosuda's sister was surprisingly good and wasnt a horny bastard. Pretty unique for an anime\\n\r\n                  Daisuke - The boyfriend of Takeshita was a pretty notable chracter even though he didn't talk a lot. He gave kosuda good advice\\n\r\n                  Misato Mami - Besides Kosuda she was my favorite character. She wasn't related to the main story at all but gave some great one liners that had me cracking up.\\n\r\n                  Miyano - She was Kosuda childhood friend that was pretty funny when she was put in awkward situations\\n\r\n                  Chika - Yamada's sister Chika was best when she gave her one liners watching Yamda being weird.\\n\r\n                  Takeshita - Yamda's best friend was Yamda's moral compass and gave a lot of good advice and had funny interactions with Yamda. She also was the fan service of the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I  really enjoyed this show a lot and recommend it to anyone thats ok with school anime and echii.\\n",

When I first watched it, I couldn't look away. The interactions between all of the characters are hilarious to say the least. I found myself binging this show once I started because I lost track of time.\r\nIf you are looking for a great comedy, I have to highly recommend B Gata H Kei. Overall the show garners an 8/10 from me partly because I would have wanteda more conclusive ending to really put it over the top. However, if you are able to look past it and enjoy the journey along the way, it truly is a good time.",

Here is my review.\r\nArt/Animation-\r\nI don't think there is much to say here. I think the art and animation were good, nothing amazing though. There are these funny moments where the characters become like cartoons (smaller with a wierd face) which I think is a great addition to comedy anime. I have to note that some of the character designs were a bit too familiar, perhaps this was done on purpose. \r\nSound- \r\nOnce again I didn't find too muchhere, the soundtrack was pretty good but with nothing too memorable. Once again I don't judge the songs of the OP and the ED, as for their animation, it's pretty good as well. I don't like these kind of ED's though, not because of the animation or sound, but because not much is going on in them and even if the song is really good they are usually less popular because of the OP. This is the case in many anime, as I continue to mention. \\n\\n\r\nStory- \\n\r\nThis is the interesting part, as per usual. You usually don't expect a comedy show to have a good or even decent story, and you also can't expect much from the description of it. However behind all the comedy and fanservice there is actually a decent story that actually fits the comedy part. While it's not amazing or too unique it blends in with the funny parts so well, so i'm giving it a 7/10 instead of a 6/10. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters- \\n\r\nMost of the characters seem to be very stereotypical at first. This is not really wrong. However, these supporting characters are, while not the most original, pretty interesting, some even having some twists to them. Even the deuteragonist (who is a male) seems so normal and boring, it looks like it was done on purpose. However all of this characters are surrounding the main character, who is very unique (especially for a main character) and has really good development over the show, along with the other main character. While I believe some supporting characters were not important enough as they should have been, they are still important as a part of the story and all create for a funny and interesting combination. \\n\\n\r\nOverall/Personal Opinion- \\n\r\nI have to say that shows like this are not my type, however I still managed to enjoy this one. While I would personally give it a 7/10 I can see what is good in it, and what made it so good in the eyes of people who do like these type of shows, so i'm giving it an 8/10. I reccomend you give it a try, especially if it interests you personally.",

Of course it is exaggerated for comedic effect, but the idea is that a teenager can really want to have sex but is also really freaked out when it might actually happen. Sure, Yamada's goal of 100 sex partners is over-the-top, but it's just there to emphasize that girls can be sex obsessed, too. The series is really more about the young and innocent trying everything they can to experience sex for the first time, and mostly getting in their own way. Of particular note is the way the two maincharacters are constantly trying to guess what the other is thinking, and usually getting it wrong. That's life in a nutshell!\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise the series was a fun and goofy comedy with a bunch of raunchy suggestive scenes. And supposedly the blu-ray version will be uncensored, so your sexy naked anime girls won't all be covered up by the ubiquitous Demon Seal brand logo!",

I just thought that the whole concept just seemed funny.\r\nThe truth is, you may think from the very beginning that the story is going to be dirty, thanks to Yamada's constant need to have sex, but what's so funny is that there are guys that are all over her all the time, but she can't GIVE it away. \r\nEvery time that she has a chance to get sex, she just freaks out and calls thema pervert, but has these huge delirious ideas of what she'd like. The truth is, she'll talk about it throughout the whole series, but she's just a virgin, like everyone else. :3 \\n\\n\r\nThe story is outstanding and it certainly keeps you on your toes. The only really dirty part is on the 12th episode and even that's not that horrid. Still not advised for young children because this IS going to have a lot of language I certainly wouldn't want my future children to hear. xD",

After watching the first episode, I was interested in how this would be played out, and I like how the creators wanted to take a different path for our female main character.\r\nThe story is basically about Yamada with a goal in high school, which is to have sex with 100 guys. Yep, 100 guys, and the fact that she's not the usual, clich\u00e9d Japanese girl who's in other anime makesB Gata H Kei a lot more interesting. Now that being said she wastes no time in getting this operation started, until she realized that she needs to lose her virginity first. So she puts back the 100 guy plan and looks for a virgin herself, and that's where she meets Kusuda. After meeting him, the anime goes on showing how the feelings they have for each other bloomed.\\n\\n\r\nNow about the art and sound, I'm not really the type of person who will go into deep detail about these two but, the art in B Gata H Kei was great actually. In some anime the characters looks pretty plain, but in this every character had a unique quality in their appearance, except for Kusuda. I really disliked how he looked, he was very plain. \\n\r\nAs for the sound the opening theme was perfect for this anime. The music they played through out scenes were well played, and some fit the right moment perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this were all likable, except for one of the main, which was Kusuda. I'm not really the type to beat up characters, especially in romance animes for being clueless but I have to say Kusuda is a complete no no. I mean it could've been because I watched this English dubbed instead or subbed, but I have to say that Kusuda's English voice acting was horrible. Other than that the characters were hilarious, and I liked all of them.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I really did enjoy this anime, I entered it feeling unsure if I did, but it started off with comedy right off the bat, and that's why I gave enjoyment the score of 9, but overall I gave it an 8 because of Kusuda's voice acting, although his Japanese voice actor is probably a lot better. Overall I recommend this to other people, and yes ladies this is female friendly ^.^",

            "content": "Summary:\r\nB gata H Kei is a Ecchi Romance Comedy Anime made by Hal Film maker and Localized by FUNimation, it is about a girl named Yamada who is entering High School and has a the dream of sleeping with over 100 guys before she graduates. Do to her insecurities about her body/being a virgin she rejects any guy who wants to go out with her plus the fact that she doesn't know the first thing about sex she doesn't know where to start until she meets Kosuda her \"Golden Cherry Boy\" who she declares she will have sex with first.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMy Thoughts:\r\nWhen I first started watchingB gata H Kei I watched it knowing I was gonna hate it but need to kill some time and wanted to find out how bad it was. Surprisingly enough I actually started liking the show the more I watched it and found myself wanting to watch the next episode after finishing one. While this show defiantly isn't as good as other romance anime such as Clannad, Yamada and Kosuda are still likable enough that you enjoy seeing them together and want to see their relationship succeed. Also where this show shines is the comedy aspect. At some points I was practically out of breath from laughing so much. Usually sexual comedy really isn't my personal favorite but this show does it so well it is really had not to laugh.\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nYamada- A young girl who at first glance is a lustful vain narcissist and even at a second glace she is still those things but she has insecurities and realistic emotions as well that is latter fleshed out more.\\n\\n\r\nKosuda, Takashi- A Sheepish indecisive young man who is about average in about every sense of the word but is the Cherry of Yamada's eye. \\n\\n\r\nMinharu Takeshita- Yamada's best friend, who is somewhat sarcastic or dry and is usually her voice of reason even though her concerns are usually ignored. \\n\\n\r\nKyoka Kanejo- Yamada's rival and the series antagonist, she is obsessed with perfection and her brother Keiichi.\\n\\n\r\nMayu Miyano- childhood friend of Kosuda and is in love with Kousuda but she can't seem to make Kousuda realize it.\\n\\n\r\nand of course...\\n\\n\r\nSex God Yamada Cloud Thing- It is like Yamada's imaginary friend but a really sexual imaginary friend who wants to get Yamada laid and has a white mustache and cane because fuck it.\\n\\n\r\nalso other side characters include:\\n\\n\r\nChicka- Yamada's Sister\\n\r\nKazuki- Kosuda's Sister\\n\r\nDaisuke- Miharu's Boyfriend\\n\\n\r\nAlso while on the subject of characters both the Japanese and English dubs are actually pretty good. While I have only finished the entire show in English going back in watching a few in Japanese you really are good going with either.\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------\\n\r\nAnimation/Music\\n\r\nOpening/Ending Theme\\n\r\nWhile I am no expert on Music or Animation just from out of everything I have watched the shows animation and music are quite average. But mind you the Opening has a tune so catchy even though it is in Japanese you will be humming it for weeks and the video sequence is also nice and fits the show well but is nothing to memorable.\\n\r\nThe ending is also quite average video is quite average but the song again is catchy as fuck and it to you will not be out of your head anytime soon.\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nOverall I actually enjoyed the anime quite a bit but still all characters besides Yamada feel underdeveloped and flat, The story at times seems to drag at points, and the animation/music are over all quite average.\\n\r\nSaying that I defiantly recommend to watch this show if you need something to enjoyably kill some time.\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 6/10\\n\r\nMusic: 6/10\\n\r\nOpening/Ending Theme: 8/10\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\n---------------------------------------\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nStream It, Don't buy it.",

            "content": "*sigh* B Gata H Kei....You remind me so much of an anime version of Sex in the City...\r\nB Gata H Kei, or Yamada's first time, is about a 15 year old girl named Yamada who was just enrolled in Takizawa High School. She is considered to be beautiful, but there is only one problem. She is TOTALLY concious about her own body and she constantly questions why certain parts of her body looks extremely weird. During her time of becoming a high school student,  she has decided that she wants to have sex with 100 guys by the time she graduates. But there aremore problems: she's still a virgin, she doesn't know anything about seduction or sex, and she hasn't even had her first kiss yet. Throughout the series, she comes across different solutions to perform on fellow classmate, Kosuda Takashi, who is also a virgin. Yamada believes that seducing Kosuda will help her seduce more men in the world.\\n\\n\r\nI liked this anime because there were hilarious moments that made me fall out of  my seat and the fact that Yamada's determination to lose her virginity really made me give her a tiny bit of sympathy for her in hopes that she does lose her virginity. But, her determination also had its flaws as well. As a first impression with this anime, I thought that Yamada looked extremely desperate and annoying, given the fact that she would always tease her best friend and classmate Takeshita and gives Kosuda the nickname \"Cherry Boy\". I.believe that Kosuda is the type of person who would be considered \"pure\" before marriage but he would also be open to anything, depending on what the relationship is like. Of course as I progressed through the anime, the relationship between Yamada and Kousda was pretty complicated. Like Facebook complicated. I mean they were technically in a relationship...But they weren't at the same time. Yamada made it seem as if the relationship was just strictly sexual and casual. Nothing else. This relationship included lots of jealously between themselves and people in and outside of school and all the awkwardness in the entire world as they are trying to figure out what they really want from the opposite sex.This sex comedy follows the exact plot of sexual American dramas, with a splash of difficult situations from left to right. I guess you can say that this could also be categorized as a slice of life anime as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would give this anime a 8/10 because of its complicated relationships between characters and how it quickly resembles Sex in the City (I have only watched one episode of Sex in the City, don't judge me). I would  recommend this anime to anyone who is interested into sexual humor and comedy, and if you're not, you'll probably want to stay away because this anime is a lot to handle, in a cute and sexual way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It's funny that only you and that friend know the main characters true motives.\r\nThe dialogue is good and realistic. It's easy to understand how the characters feel. I really laughed at some of the embarrassing things that were said.\r\nThe animation is good but not remarkable.\r\nI wouldn't recommend this right away, only ifthe person who asks doesn't have anything else to watch.\\n",

But this anime had a very unique story, where, instead of the guy, the girl is perverted(always thinks about sex), which makes the anime very entertaining to watch. The story builds very rapidly. Taking different events and also talking other character's side stories , but keeping in mind the main story. \r\nrating=9\r\nSound- Good background sound given to events, i loved the theme song and the ending song. \r\nrating=10\r\nCharacter- Main characters were very well described, but the othercharacters were kept away from most of the scenes in the beginning and middle of the story( i really wanted to see some of the characters more often). But i didn't think they could have done much with a 12 episode anime. \\n\r\nrating=8\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Really entertaining, the rapid story build really kept up the pace, and made it more enjoyable. The humor was typical ecchi type, lot of perverted jokes(which i like).\\n\r\nrating=9\\n\\n\r\nOverall it is one of the best ecchi anime( i would say), it was informative in some cases too. Really awesome characters. Story was really gripping. I would have loved more episodes or a second season, but that will never happen(you'll know when you see the ending).\\n",

At the end of the series she ended up falling in love with the guy.  Just what you expect from two amateurs when it comes to sex was total disaster. It showed that being ecchi doesn\u2019t necessarily means being lewd. Sometimes being ecchi can be so hilarious like this one.\r\nThe heroine was the weirdest and most unique protagonist I\u2019ve everseen. I mean, it\u2019s very rare that the heroine could be so bold, vulgar, and so damn ecchi. I\u2019ve never seen a protagonist who wanted to get laid so damn bad. It\u2019s like her whole world was all about sex and her mind was filled with getting laid 24/7. She could even be considered as an anti-heroine. What\u2019s more hilarious was the fact that she\u2019s obviously an amateur when it comes to sex but can be so bold about it and ended up screwing everything.\\n\\n\r\nWell, it\u2019s not one of the best but if you want to laugh your hearts out then I can recommend this. If you\u2019re game with green jokes then this is one for you. Though don\u2019t expect so much from the story because it\u2019s just pure comedy. It was entertaining and satisfying at least.\\n",

            "content": "Ok- first of all this was a laugh out loud series that can be seriously placed under comedy- but if you're looking for something that'll get you into Hentai and Ecchi /slowly/ without over-doing it then this is the perfect anime.\r\nStory-8:Reason: Like with most 12-ep anime (some of my favs) they had a plot and they had to have enough material to fill but not too much to go over and swamp the audience. Luckily this story was easy to follow and in some cases too simple where the ideas just meshed and wind up being comical all the way through. Seperated into two partsfor each episode which would make them mini episodes (like Hetalia) it did span over 2 years within the series. Pretty good for what they were aiming for with the main characters and their struggle. XD They do break 4th-wall a lot of beware.\\n\\n\r\nArt-7:Reason: The art was something to admire but not over-analyze it. To me it had a kind of \"glossy\" appearance where everything was like plastic. I liked it, and I thought it had a clean look. Background work was detailed, especially for scenes used for nature, houses, paintings, etc. which can be seen in the series(look around hard enough). The characters were \"normal\" in a sense with the exception of a few pink-haired characters that sparkled. And for the subbed version they do provide censors, so don't think you'll see anything.\\n\\n\r\nSound-7:Reason: Obvious this anime has a \"naughty\" feel to it, so the sounds are going to lean towards that- but in a funny way. The main characters get the blunt end of this throughout the entire show. Funny sound effects are added to emphasize certain actions more in this anime than some others, which again makes it more cartoon-ish, even for the \"naughty/comedy\" bits there are sounds that you'd normally here coming from a circus or in an only cartoon. But that's the point- and it's rather appropriate to lighten the mod and make the audience laugh. The music for the entire show stayed constant. Really cute and adorable- like a musical version/summary of what's happening in the show. I wouldn't say the opening or ending are addictive if you listen for awhile-but they do give you a bubbly-happy feeling, so it's a good pick-me-up.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-7: Reason: OK- first off a lot of characters not too much character development aside from the main two characters. the rest are merely side-cast. Some characters do explain themselves and over all in this anime I suppose it's alright not to have to much going on-it would distract from the main idea. Although this could also be considered a harem at one point- the characters do have their individual ideas and actions as the story progresses. Rivalries appear, hearts broken, and many just seem out to get the other- while all still being funny. And it all makes you just want to push the characters along it gets slightly frustrating with them. But over-all decently entertaining characters and each one fills a typical anime role well if you can spot them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10-Reason:It just had me laughing, simple. The anime itself had a straight and obvious plot but the journey to get to that point was just filled with obstacles that might not normally happen in real life (or maybe they do depending on who you are) or just seems like bad luck and misunderstandings ruled over the characters lives. The main heroine Yamada(never figures out her name) is just a bundle of nerves and guts- but not too bright while her leading man Kosuda is just as block-headed...and the Eros deities literally have nothing better to do but explain things and watch from the sidelines with failing attempts on helping out- which again brings it all down to enjoying watching these characters make fools of themselves over something...delicate but not the most complicated thing in the world.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-8:Reason: Fun, entertaining, a good way to experience the \"naughty\" side to anime but still know where the line is drawn with the comedy. Nothing too out there but something anyone willing to watch should. Re-watching is also an option for laughs.",

That's cause it is, fam.  Time to tighten your ninja headband and pull out your Japanese candies you ordered off amazon, and lock your door so your parents don't come in, cause your in for a classic.  This anime had me smiling throughout the whole anime due to its original character design and the thought process of the anime's main character, Yamada.  Truth be told, you'llnever find an anime like this anywhere else (Or at least to my knowledge).  If you are big on the romance/comedy/ecchi genre, this is a MUST.  It's only 12 episodes and if you arent satisfied with that I'm pretty sure they go further in the manga.  I cannot stress this enough but please watch this, as it will definitely be in your top # anime list.",

Since I was simultaneously watching Stein's Gate and Kuma Miko (which are both equally brilliantly hilarious), B Gata H Kei had some serious competition when it came to making me laugh and keeping me hooked. \r\nLuckily, this show never once disappointed me, and, on the contrary, often surprised me. From the unusual and creative premise to the relate-able characters as well as the great voice acting and cute music, this anime had lots of strengths that made it come together perfectly. \r\nNevertheless, this show was not without itsweaknesses. Although I personally found the jokes pretty hilarious, some people may find them slightly vulgar or immature, but hey, this is ecchi, so... what did you expect? \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, for an ecchi anime, B Gata H Kei is surprisingly tame and relies more on humor created by jokes, dialogues, and awkward situations rather than endless panty or boob shots. (Fear not, however, as there's some of that too). \\n\\n\r\nFor me, the only real downside to this show was the art. While the characters were pretty generic but decent, the backgrounds were incredibly lazy to the point of being cringe-worthy. This would occasionally kill the \"brilliant\" vibe this show had going on and install a \"cheap\" vibe instead, but overall it was bearable. \\n\\n\r\nDespite its flaws, B Gata H Kei is an excellent show which relies on an entertaining plot and dynamic characters to bring its slightly-perverted humor to life. Whether you're fan of the genre or not, you will probably find yourself laughing in surprise and disbelief at Yamada's unexpectedly awkward sexual adventures.\\n",

            "content": "Looking at the synopsis for this series again, I'm actually wondering the exact same thing. Whatever the reason, I am so glad I watched B Gata H Kei, as it was surprisingly one of the best comedy anime series I saw in 2010.\r\nBrace yourself for the synopsis, because, as I mentioned before, it's pretty crazy. The story centers around Yamada, (first name withheld for whatever reason) a high school girl with the face and body of a model. Apon entering high school, Yamada decides on a crazy goal: to have casual sex with 100 boys. However, being self concious of the fact that she isa virgin, she decides she needs to start by targeting a boy who is a virgin as well. She soon crosses paths with Kosuda, the most generic, uninteresting boy she has ever met, who, unfortunately for him, meets Yamada's criteria perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nWhen watching the first episode of B Gata H Kei, I had incredibly low expectations just from reading the synopsis. Needless to say, I was dead wrong to assume that this series wouldn't be any good. I found myself cracking up several times, sometimes to the point of tears. What makes this series so hillarious is that, as determined as she is, Yamada has no freaking clue what she's doing. She chickens out of her supposedly \"brilliant\" plans, and when she actually gets the balls to do something, she has no clue where to go next. Admit it: it is so much fun to watch people screw up.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters...well they're all idiots. There are several points in the series where you wonder what kind of moron actually does shit like this. Some of the better supporting characters in the series include Tachibana, Yamada's best girl friend who is often rather annoyed with her one-track mind, and Kajenou, a gorgeous American girl with a severe brother complex. But if you've seen this series, you will probably be surprised with my answer. Her name is Misato. She can't really even be considered a supporting character...more like a background character. She is flat chested, short, and generally unnatractive in the eyes of men...which isn't so good considering she likes to follow hot guys around like a lost puppy and drool all over them like a bulldog. Although she only made about one, short appearence per episode, I had to smile every time she appeared.\\n\\n\r\nFlaws? Oh yeah, very many. First of all, like many animes in the comedy-ecchi genre, it fails when it tries to be dramatic. The more sentemental scenes were just boring, and when you watch them, you want them to skip to the comedy as quickly as possible. Second of all, the characters, although very entertaining, were not very well developed. There are several points in the series where the characters do things that, as far as you know, are completely unlike them. \\n\\n\r\nThe main problem I had with B Gata H Kei was that if you're going to do a series like this, the comedy has to get better with every episode. With this series, the laugh-chart kind of moved in a straight line, and it got a little bit old after a while.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I am very glad I gave this series a try. Although I would never say it's the best comedy series I've seen, I can say that it is most likely the best ecchi. I was very sad to see this series come to an end, and I still find myself hoping for more.",

For most of it its a romantic comedy with sexual jokes and such thrown into the mix. If you like romantic comedies, this one is full of it. \r\nAnd yes i think the main female is very cute ;P",

            "content": "B Gata H Kei is a recent 2010 spring anime series based on a 4 koma manga that is currently, to my knowledge, still running. You're basic school romantic comedy with a twist (of course, was isn't these days). It's animated by Hal Film Maker, who also did Skip Beat!, another good romantic comedy. First and foremost, B Gata H Kei is heavily based on sex jokes and not so much physical humor as most romantic comedy's are, along with the fact that it aired at one AM, this is easily not recommendable for girls/women; this is strictly teenagers to old guys. The humor mostlystems from the nympho female lead, Yamada, who's dream is to have 100 sex buddies due to her virgin insecurities. However, she's quick to try and rush the sex part of her relationship with male lead, Takashi Kosuda. But despite her high ambitions, she can't find it in her to go through with the act, devolving from self proclaimed sex maniac, to a normal shy virgin girl. Not helping the situation is Kosuda's own sexual inexperience and nervousness, leading to usually hilarious awkward moments. Usually.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The entire story is told literally in the first five minutes; Yamada wants sex. Her pride keeps her from jumping anyone more experienced with her, so she \"chooses\" Kosuda. From episodes one to twelve, it remains entirely episodic, with usually a small string of plot keeping the episodes connected. Characters are introduced at a good steady pace with an obvious and huge focus on Yamada. Anybody who watches B Gata H Kei will either love Yamada, or hate her, depending on how you think about it. On the outside, she's just a sex maniac, which alone is enough to get on some people's nerves, who can't go through with actually have sex with a guy, even though when you're the school idol anyone will have sex with you. At first i thought this was funny, then i got really tired of it, until i thought about it differently. She's clearly a parody of \"horny\" girls who try to grow up too fast. While I may be reading into this too much, you'll see that she goes to great lengths to know sex, yet refuses to try it. Clearly no girl is as crazy for sex as she is, and her straight faced friend, Takeshita Miharu, even points out that she makes no sense. Even Kosuda is a parody; he's portrayed as a boring individual, and it definitely shows as in most of his scenes his name is either forgotten or he's ignored outright. There is the classic childhood friend unrequited love, which everybody is so dense about it's almost pitiful. Even the cliche perfect study abroad girl who returns to Japan is \"perfect\", she definitely wants to keep the apples falling as close to the tree as possible (you'll see). Don't take the story or characters seriously, it's a light hearted sex comedy that doesn't treat sex like taboo, but this may be the only thing that makes it funny. Watch the first episode and decide, as i can't tell if the humor came from the shock value of a crazy horny girl, or if it was legitimately funny.\\n\\n\r\nOne complaint is the last two episodes, where it ultimately devolves into a borderline hentai video. Nothing is shown, but it quickly goes from funny perverted show, to censored porn. Again, don't take it seriously though, it's a more realistic view of what virgins think when they first have sex. The conclusion is also meh, but above average. It gives a clear conclusion for most characters, and ends nicely, but abruptly. It ends in a way that won't have a sequel, but you know it still goes on in the B Gata H Kei world.\\n\\n\r\nAsthetics: The art is simple and nice, but nothing amazing. Character designs aren't interesting, which is a shame since there aren't too many characters that get the spotlight. Clothes; however, are rather nice. While most school life animes have nothing but uniforms, you'll see a nice variety of dresses and suits, but if you're a guy you probably don't care and most people watching this will be guys. Opening is poppy and energetic, while the ending isn't anything special, music isn't used too much during the show either. \\n\\n\r\nI know B Gata H Kei got a lot of bad rep (threatening letters) but it's a good show if it's a satire, bad show if it's a straight romantic comedy. In the end, don't take it seriously and don't go looking for amazing plots. Girls should stay away if looking for romantic comedies, but any girl looking to laugh at themselves or have a good sense of dirty humor are welcome.",

            "content": "There is only one way to describe the main character of this anime, nympho-maniac. That being said, this is a really hilarious anime that I enjoyed far more than I thought I would. First, one might see this as cliche, Boy meets girl, they both fall in love with each other and blah blah blah. Those animes are always good and I am a fan of that kind of thing but this was very original. Our main character Yamada is crazy about sex, and would be considered overly perverted even if she was a boy despite holding her \"V card\" as they put it inthe translation. All she wants is be become experience with another virgin before she accomplishes her goal of giving it up to 100 guys. She mercilessly tries to use Kosuda at first, but unbeknownst to both of them they start to like each other as in most animes. The transformation/evolution of their feelings is very rewarding to watch.\\n\r\nNow that I told you about the romance part, Ill tell you about the comedy. I personally watched the dubbed version of this series and I believe that it added something due to some ludicrous translations. The animation of some of the scenes also added to the comedy. Now, the part that added the most to the comedic nature of this anime was the story itself, in anime usually only a guy is perverted, but Yamada is so sex crazed yet so inept its hilarious. I thought it was a great change of pace.\\n\r\nAfter those two main aspects of the story the character development was excellent as well as their design. So I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Rosario and Vampire, Nagizaka Haruka no Himitsu, Chobits, or Itazura Na Kiss.",

Have you ever not been aware that a girl was into you until she flat out states it?\r\nIf the answer is yes, maybe B Gata H Kei  feel familiar to you.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story of B Gata H Kei is; Yamada, a high school girl wants to make one hundred sex friends, but because of her lack of experience she has to start small with the cherry boy Takeshi Kosuda. As there relationship grows comedy ensues as all they want to do is get to know each other a little andbang like rabbits. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nFor a show like this it has surprisingly nice artwork. The coloring is bright. The animation while a little stiff looks presentable. Backgrounds are typical but not bad in any stretch of the imagination. Character design, while very plain feels comforting.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say about the soundtrack. It suits the role of background music. Voice acting is also very nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7.5/10\\n\r\nHere is where the show gets good. The characters are really fun. The sex crazed Yamada is a very fun character who shows some good comic relief, while having some very cute moments of her own. Kosuda is also someone who can be funny at times as you see the spaghetti fall out of his pockets from episode to episode. Side characters like Takeshita (best girl), Miyano, and Kyouko all provide good side content and gets you better invested in the characters lives.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nThis is a fun show. It's innocent and cute enough. If your down or just bored give this show a watch. It's not the worst show out there nor is it the best but, if you're like me you'll have a good time.",

            "content": "Here with my third review, this time for 'B Gata H Kei', and can I just say, If your reading this review than you will probably never get laid..............ANYWAY!!\r\nIf you are an ecchi, romance, comedy lover. Than look no further. This show will be in your top ten in no time\r\nFor me, I'm not the biggest fan of ecchi. So I was really hesitant to watch this anime. I mean, the premise of a girl wanting to have sex with 100 guys!! Come on!! However I can say I did not regret watching this show at all!!\r\nThe reason why I like this show so muchis not for it's characters, not for it's plot (perviest plot ever XD), not for it's art, no none of that stuff. The reason why I like this show so much is the same reason why I love Toradora so much, and that is the relationship between the two main characters Kosuda and Yamada.\\n\\n\r\nThis relationship that they have is the only one that has ever topped Ryuuji and Taiga for me. The way the story progresses, and how Yamada's feelings for Kosuda start to develop further than him being her sex toy. As clich\u00e9 as it sounds, I liked it a lot.\\n\\n\r\n(Spoiler here, you've been warned)\\n\r\nAlso the point where Yamada pulls her hand away from Keiichi when he tried to kiss it, I was all Like Ohhhhhhhh dang, You just got shot down man!! It was totally unexpected, and not to mention my favorite part in the whole show. So even though it is clich\u00e9, it has some things that will really surprise you.\\n\\n\r\nStory (8) I'm giving the story an 8, because though it is extremely perverted and just weird. It is also unique in it's own way. I can't think of another show who has done anything like this, can you? Even though she never actually does have sex with 100 guys, but not like that wasn't already obvious.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9) I really like a lot of the side characters. The only problem was we didn't get to learn about a lot of them like Daisuke, Miharu, Kazuki etc. But what are you gonna do in a 12 episode show. You wouldn't have time for the main premise if you focused to much on backgrounds, so I can see why it lacked for most part.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8) As I've said before, the way I see it there are four kinds of anime art. There is simple and cute, simple and ugly, complex and beautiful, complex and overdone. Most anime fall under the simple and cute one, along with this anime. I really liked the art in the show, but for being a 2010 made I was expecting a little bit better. Though I can't complain, I have seen worse\\n\\n\r\nSound (8) Like I have also said before, I've never known how to really judge sound. I guess I should judge it, for this anime, being the emotion that was felt. Most of the time, the emotional parts in this show would be more awkward than anything. There wasn't really any moment that pulled on my heartstrings, but none the less I really liked it.\\n\\n\r\nI can also judge the voice acting for sound as well. I watched the english dubbed version so...don't hate me. I really loved all of the voice actors. Brittney Karbowski is one of my favorite voice actresses, and I think she pulls off Yamada amazingly. I do really like Scott Freeman's voice, but being Kosuda I liked his voice even more. He really pulls off Kosuda well. Cherami Leigh to with Miharu, I really liked it\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10) For some reason, I'm not sure why, B Gata H Kei is one of those shows that I can watch over and over and never get bored. The only other show that has done that for me has been...of course...Toradora. I don't what it is about it, but It's humor and unexpected events along with a beautiful growing romance between two unlikely people just get me going every time. So If you are anything like me than you will love this show a lot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9) I am giving this show a 9 because, though it's relationship was the best that I've ever seen (In my opinion) the other things that it lacked brings the score down. But evidently not much because a 9 is still really good. So what are you waiting for? Quit reading this boring review and go watch the show already!!",

            "content": "Okay, first off, I'll be honest, I was in the mood for some low-brow sexy comedy when I found this one. And, I can't imagine that most people would find it as enjoyable as I did, but then again, I'm basically Yamada in male form. But I'm not just talking about the sex obsession, I'm talking about overthinking. That was the thing that really got to me about this show.\r\nHave you ever had a friend who needs to think things through, who never has a plan but also isn't spontaneous? Who isn't shy but is reserved? Yamada is such a wonderful character who is poorlyrepresented in the world of entertainment. A character who lives in her own head, concocting fantasies, scheming, creating plans that all fall awry because one thing doesn't go her way. Confident of her goals but terrified of failure to meet them. There are so many people that can relate to this character, and I'm definitely one of them.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also refreshing to see a very accurate depiction of attitude in a highschool setting in an anime, at least as a westerner. A lot of anime that I've watched tends to make everyone embarrassed of relationships, sex, romance, attraction, while this show aims to show more how people can be one way and act another. That whole feeling of, \"If Yamada was honest with herself, she could have her cake and eat it too, but she's so obsessed with being this thing she isn't, that she never gets laid\". Well, how many people can you name that were like that, especially in highschool. People put on one face and feel a completely different way.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, if you're a prude or feel like this isn't appropriate for kids, guess what, it's not for kids. It's cathartic to those of us living in our own heads, it's reminiscent of HS and all it's funny quirks in a frighteningly accurate way, and it's pretty spot-on as to what hormones are did to us at that age, what they do to kids today, and what they will do to the kids we all end up having.",

Unfortunately, that's about where my attachment to this anime ends. \r\nI thought the main character was a bit of a moron, and not in a lovable way. I've yet to see any reason for the male lead to fall for her. Yes she is the most attractive girl in school, but is also a bully. (yes, it's only because she's nervous/excentric, but I don't see much ofa silver lining.) I wasn't rooting for them to be together at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime starts as a quest to sleep with 100 boys, and turns into a realistic romance. This anime deals with themes that are more realistic to high school students, and not the cliche anime themes of \"i accidentally grabbed your boobs, we kissed, now we are a couple.\" This paired along with the comedy, this anime had a lot of potential. Too bad I wanted to punch every one of the characters in the face.",

When you read the plot synopsis you might think it's full-on hentai, but it's actually nowhere near that. \r\nIt's a teenage romance comedy sprinkled with some ecchi throughout, and as the plot kept on progressing, I focused way more on the romantic/comedic parts rather than the ecchi parts. \r\nI personally really enjoyed it because I could really relate to the main character. I was exactly the same as her when I was 15. Hormonal, lustful, thoughts going wild everyday... but completely awkward and clueless as to how to go aboutmy desires and how to express them. Also, I thought it was really refreshing to see a sex-obsessed female lead character. There's plenty of ecchi anime out there with sleazy male protagonists - seeing things from a female perspective is definitely a nice change, especially since it's so spot on (the author of the manga is female, if I'm not mistaken, so it definitely makes sense). \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, don't let the plot synopsis drag you away from this anime - it's nowhere near as dirty as it sounds. Even though Yamada (the main protagonist) says she wants to eventually have 100 sexual partners, it's as clear as day she's not ready for it nor does she know how the hell to go about it. At the end of the day it's a really cute romantic comedy revolving around two inexperienced teenagers discovering themselves and coming to terms with their sexuality. It definitely had me reminiscing about my own past and realizing both me and my male interests at that time were exactly the way Yamada and Kosuda are portrayed - awkward, nervous, thoughts and fantasies running rampant, not knowing what the other thinks, being too afraid to ask, messing up... It's all part of growing up. And our two protagonists do it so well together. \u2665 I really enjoyed the story, it's 10/10 for me.",

It is truly a horrific type of anime that even the creators have received a lot of backlash for creating it.\r\nStory\r\nThe story is absolutely ridiculous, a 15 year old believes that her issue is the fact that she is a virgin and that she must get rid of it post-haste. Each episode follows a particular cookie-cutter formula, girl wants guy, guy wants girl, both don't understand each other and are unable to go any further because either they are too shy or because of the situation. It is funny andentertaining at first but because it is so cookie-cutter repetitive it becomes annoying real fast.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nNever have I watched an anime and my favorite character was the mop in a corner. None of the characters here are likeable whatsoever. The protagonist is highly unlikeable and this isn't an accident it is meant to be that way by the show's creators. This is almost always a problem, you really can't have a story around a character that is made to be hated. The guy/love interest of the protagonist, is an idiot. The female protagonist friends are all too stupid to tell the protagonist needs mental help, seriously they recognize the problem that the protagonist has problems, their reaction is only to act disgusted. Never have I wished for a mop to become alive and murder all the characters.

            "content": "Be warned: this show is an advertisement for the manga. If you were hoping for a story with a conclusion, please look elsewhere.\r\nI never really watch ecchi-type shows. Not out of some lofty, anachronistic disgust at a show with sexual themes, but more because they rarely offer anything interesting in terms of story and character. In many ways, this series followed that trend, but also surpassed my expectations in certain ways. I was pleasantly surprised at the lack of blatant fanservice. I usually start rolling my eyes and losing interest in shows that incessantly look for excuses to do panty shots, accidental gropes, walk-ins etc.,so it was a nice change of pace to see a show that uses sex only when it seems important to the character and story development. Until the last episode. Hooooooly fuck the last episode. What an absolute trainwreck. No spoilers, but it was honestly one of the most bafflingly idiotic fanservice romps I've ever seen. It was nothing but a series of absurdly contrived non-sequiturs to rip through as many pointless fanservice moments as possible. All I can think is that it must have been contractually obligated by the publishers. Otherwise, I see no reason why the creators of the show would have produced something so unforgivably stupid. A mentally handicapped child could have easily written a satisfying ending to this show, and instead we got something that played like the transcribed ramblings of a sex addict on bath salts. \\n\\n\r\n*deep breath*\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the main characters were at least relatable enough to be interesting. I can easily see myself acting very similarly in high school, and to be honest, I found Yamada and Kosuda's starting point to be a fairly insightful depiction of a young adult's sexual awakening. Filled with hormones and obsessed with sex but too timid and inexperienced to actually get anything done. I just wish they had developed, like at all. The show seems to go out of its way to avoid interactions between the two romantic leads and I found myself wondering if they had ever actually had a casual conversation. From a story structure perspective, of course the two leads are going to end up together, but the show never really gives us a reason why. The supporting cast was pretty bare-bones and mostly there for comic relief, which they accomplish for the most part. The recurring \"sex-gods\" gag was probably my favorite part of the show and got a few actual out-loud laughs from me. \\n\\n\r\nI don't have much to say about the story. As far as rom-coms go, it felt pretty formulaic, but formulas exist for a reason. If it works, it works. It doesn't get points for doing anything particularly new or interesting, but it keeps the train on the rails long enough to deliver some good comedy. Then the last episode happened, and you already know how I feel about that. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was never amazing, but it wasn't glaringly bad either. I generally only take artwork into my evaluation when it fits one of these two categories. However, whoever decided to give the Kanejou siblings those obnoxious perpetual sparkles has a special place waiting for them in hell. \\n\\n\r\nI listened to the OP and ED once each and decided to spare my ears that experience for the rest of my viewing. The voice acting was very trope-centric and every stereotype had a fitting voice. I did find myself questioning the choice for Yamada's voice. I couldn't help but think the voice sounded way to young for someone who was supposedly a post-pubescent high school Junior. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can't honestly recommend this show. If it had ended satisfactorily, I may have considered it, but the final episode gave me actual for-realsies PTSD and I would never wish that on anyone.",

It`s not to be taken too serious. What this anime has as a special talent is the humour! \r\nI found the humour of this anime verygood, I actually loled a few times and I`m quite hard to please. \\n\r\nBut I think that sometimes it went overboard, like when Keiichi arrived from the airport, it was excessive the \"princess and the handkiss\" scene.\\n\r\nThe animation acompanies the humour 10/10, top level, with things like facial expressions, methaphors (like Yamada turning into a wolf), signs, funny censurs and much more. What brings us to the: \\n\\n\r\nArt (9) \\n\r\nVery cute, well made, goes well with the anime, and, as I said, added humour to the scenes that were, just by themselves, funny.  \\n\\n\r\nSound (6) \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and the ending are almost childish, but, even so... it ended up matching the anime. I confess I skipped the ending in the majority of the times, but I found the opening amusing.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and sounds are well putted in general and the voices are not sooo annoying, just on that line of funny. After all... this is a comedy ecchi, did you expect voices too serious? \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8) \\n\\n\r\nI... loved Yamada. Some may say that she is a bitch and not a \"good girl\" but... that`s exactly why I like her. She has bad intentions and the animators didn`t tryed to hide it. \\n\r\nShe is a perverted girl that wants to have many sex partners and ends up taking advantage of Kosuda (the shy virgin boy). She is vain also. \\n\r\nWell... I like that she is not the typical shy girl that ends up accidentaly naked in front of the  boy that accidentaly touches her breasts or other part of the body. \\n\r\nThe situations are not stupid accidents, she planned that, and even the occasional accidents were natural and she was asking for it.\\n\r\nAnd her Tsundere side is evident but funny. \\n\r\nKosuda is the opposite of Yamada, he likes her, and wants to do what pleases her. He is shy and the perfect match for Yamada.\\n\r\nThe other characters are kinda \"eh\". I like Yamada\u00b4s friend, she is almost the mother of Yamada. \\n\r\nAnd Kyoka, the rival of Yamada, surprised me in a good way, she was not very previsible and hides a secret that is kinda chocking.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI probably will rewatch this anime someday, it\u00b4s hilarious. \\n\r\nIf you are a kinda pervert you definitly should give B gata H kei a watch!\\n\\n\r\nTotal score: 8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I hoped for pure comedy, but its depiction of selfcouncness and unexperience in \"sexy stuff\" kinda make you understand 2 MCs - \"pervy girl\" Yamada and \"cherry boy\" Kosuda. I was having fun with some scene and in middle of it I was just like ,,I know that feeling mah dude\" (of course more in \"selfcouncness\" parts ... Yeah I am guy that writes shitti anime reviews .. You got the idea...), what makes it easier to immerse in, which is generally good, but inthis case, sometimes pitiful. The thought that this plays most with is how how hard it is to do/say something thats on your mind, because you don't know if it is normal/appropriate/doable, which is everybody's eternal struggle... UNLESS YOU FIND INTERNET FORUMS AND VPNS :-D (then you can be zombie IRL and wild beast on internet #NoLife #IWillDieAlone)\\n\r\nYeah there was some romance, which made this anime sweet (It made \"pervy girl\" more human) and bitter (the \"cook\" girl that wanted Kosuda, but was too shy ...) in same time... and more lascivious with that sys->bro thing...\\n\\n\r\nAnyway the main futures of this anime are: It can make you feel embarrassed. It is funny. There are boobs and ecchines. EDGING - or in one sentence ,,SO FU*KING CLOSE!\" But the thing that this made me think about most is the duality of every person -internal/external self (irl/online xD).. Or maybe I am overthinking it... \\n\\n\r\nI rate it 7 because I feel like this combination of humour, story, idea and characters was missing something.",

OVERALL  to sum it all up its a good anime highly recommended 10 out of ten baby go watch it now.  -caiou",

            "content": "Now you might be wondering, \"what the hell did this anime do to earn a 10 rating?\" \"does it actually deserve a 10 rating?\" \"is this dude insane?\" Well yea i am kinda insane. but i have never been so excited to write a review.\r\n(one slight caveat though: this anime is very ecchi, so when I say, \"this is amazing blah blah blah\" keep in mind its through an ecchi as heck lense)\r\nStory: 10\r\nThe premise is pretty simple. boy wants sex with girl. boy wants to lose virginity to girl. so original right? But there is one twist: gender reversal. In this anime it isactually the girl that wants to lose her virginity with the guy. with that said...\\n\r\nIt is the ultimate romantic comedy. Emphasis on Comedy. This is one of the few, no, one of two rom-com anime that truly made me laugh out loud. And not the \"LOL\" typed laughs, but actual laughter that makes sound. In terms of comedy it is true gold. sex jokes galore and cluelessness abound in this journey to adulthood for these two lovers. comedy wise, it is a laugh and a half. but thats only half of the anime. the other half, the romance of it, was also very good, including some unexpected developments for a rom-com/ecchi type anime. the complications are simple, the story is also simple, but the romance is genuine, and the comedy is top notch.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nIts an older anime, so don't expect too much from it. With that said, art wise its still very good. The style is a little older, and the animation might not be able to stand with some of the newer stuff, but it does the job well, it isn't choppy or jerky, and overall it is just well produced, very consistent in quality. Yamada is cute as heck too. especially in the opening song. Also, shoutout to the artist who included ONE SINGLE UNCENSORED NIPPLE IN THE LAST EPISODE. waiting for that was totally worth it \\n\\n\r\nSound:8\\n\r\nvery well chosen VAs. lets just put that out right now. there are a few VAs that i really like, and the ones chosen for this anime were very fitting. but other than that, the sound was pretty generic, nothing especially ear-catching. Similar to the art style, its consistent, not many cock ups. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nin a very surprising fashion for an ecchi anime. there is actually a single defining, and very serious point of development in this anime. and that point is Yamada. Yamada actually goes from becoming a frustrated virgin into a respectable lover. from wanting \"100 sex buddies\" to only wanting kosuda (the other dude). Kosuda also goes through minor development, overcoming his fears of being completely average (of which he is). Other than those two the other minor characters are all entirely run-of-the-mill archetypes. Theres the loli, the experienced friend, the childhood friend, the oni-con and her hot onii-san, the hot teacher etc etc. an all of these are entirely archetypical and single-faceted. Though every one of them is still very well written from  comedic standpoint.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nif you can't tell already, I enjoyed this anime immensely. its lighthearted, very comedic, decently romantic, and very enjoyable. and thats where the true value of this anime is. its very enjoyable, very funny, and worth watching if you have some time for a short series. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:10\\n\r\nSo maybe you've read this whole thing and you're now thinking, \"this dude is an idiot! mathematically it doesn't work, and this dude is just an idiot ecchi lover\". Which is actually true on all accounts. It doesn't work out mathematically. it just is a 10 anime in my eyes. even though the character is a bit lacking, the sound generic, and the art just decently consistent, the story really makes up for it, and really makes it enjoyable. the story is entirely worth watching it, especially for the comedy. the comedy cant be quantified. its amazingly good. and who doesn't like sex jokes?? if i had to compare it to something it would probably be a romantic version of shimoneta (which is also a great rom-com that emphasizes the comedy A LOT). but mathematically (for the haterz) it would be 3 for story+3 for comedy + 2 for characters + 1 for ecchi + 1 for being nearly softcore porn =10 hahaha (insert \"dey see me rollin', dey hatin' \" verse right here). \\n\\n\r\nSo yea a 10 for comedy gold, ecchi, and a great story tying it all together. Peace.",

            "content": "So immediately the first thing that stands out is the premise. \r\nThis anime is about Yamada, a gorgeous, popular and smart high school girl who is on a quest to bang 100 random guys before graduation. Holy shit! The room is spinning! Calm down. Take a deep breath. Keep reading. It\u2019s not a hentai and she's actually a virgin who has never even been kissed. But let\u2019s pause here for a second. This is about a hot chick looking for sex. Process that. Why would this ever take more than 5 minutes to accomplish? What\u2019s her difficulty finding a mate? Well, she\u2019s very self-conscious abouther lady parts and her lack of experience. Her \"brilliant\" solution is to have casual sex with a shy, nerdy classmate named Kosuda to prepare herself for the impending conga line of other dudes. Will she fall for Kosuda or will he just be one of her many sexual conquests? BGHK is a parody of the stereotypical high school romance genre and is filled with sexual mishaps, close calls, and ridiculous humor in the setting of surprisingly genuine character development from both parties.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to a lot of hilarious and dirty dialogue/monologue, I think this anime has heart and a very fascinating dynamic between the mains. The strength of the anime is Kosuda and Yamada\u2019s weird relationship which (initially) revolves around one issue--sex. Paradoxically, sex is their relationship\u2019s worst enemy and greatest ally. The faster Yamada and Kosuda rush into bed (as Yamada originally planned), the less likely their relationship will last. Kosuda will have been handed sex without learning anything about being a man, while Yamada will have slept with Kosuda without bonding with him enough to abandon her slutty ambitions. At the same time, without their mutual sex drives blazing they would have no impetus to interact, talk or to get to know each other. It\u2019s a strange balance. Summed up, it\u2019s a story of Yamada\u2019s internal struggle to decide whether she is capable of having either \u2018sex without love\u2019 or \u2018love without sex\u2019.\\n\\n\r\n Art: The art was very average. This became a problem with their depiction of Yamada. Yamada is supposed to be the hottest girl in school, basically a goddess amongst mortals. This is more than just a minor point as Yamada\u2019s beauty and Kosuda\u2019s plainness are integral to the premise. In truth I didn\u2019t think the animation was sharp enough to really let me appreciate the supposed huge gap between Yamada and Kosuda, or Yamada vs other girls. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the animation was fine but it requires you to use your imagination. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I loved the \u201cKiss me baby\u201d theme. Holy shit, it\u2019s the girliest song I\u2019ve ever heard but it\u2019s so god damn catchy. I\u2019m about to deadlift in the gym and god help me if the bar suddenly rips the earbuds from my MP3 player and it switches to speaker. Let\u2019s hope nobody finds out. The English Dubs are actually pretty good too. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nYamada: At least initially, she is a really horrible person. I won\u2019t deduct points for that because I think it makes her more interesting. She is vain, shallow, manipulative, jealous and selfish. \\n\r\nOn top of that, she has a complete lack of modesty or inhibition. It\u2019s hilarious. I did find it a little creepy how there was no reason for why she was so emotionally frigid. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s ok to have no explanation, and BGHK still works. Earlier I said it\u2019s a parody of the romance genre. If other animes can feature hot, popular, wholesome girls who never even considered having a boyfriend before the wimpy main character showed up, then BGHK can have the no less believable nympho Yamada. \\n\\n\r\nKosuda is your average, unimpressive loser. He\u2019s a stock character. Basically a blank slate. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters, in one way or another, serve as a massive support network for Yamada/Kosuda. They serve as pushing/pulling forces that guide Yamada/Kosuda to their journey. They are necessary for the plot but certainly not memorable as individual characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This anime ends about halfway into the Manga series. From what I gather, fans were hopeful that there would be a second season but that never happened. The BGHK anime ends on kind of a weak note. If you want to find out what happens to the characters I recommend the manga. The manga artwork is pretty bad but the story is hilarious and delightful. The manga is a lot dirtier (and funnier) than the anime series. Apparently in the manga Yamada is a compulsive masturbator. Who knew?",

            "content": "I can't stand ecchi, but I decided to give this a go because it apparently didn't fall into the frustrating plot moves ecchi normally does. It was a mistake and frankly, it has convinced me to never watch ecchi again.\r\nThe series is hilarious but falls into the many, many pitfalls of ecchi story telling. Expect to suffer many cardiac arrests from the down-right ridiculous obstacles they throw in the way of story progression, down to the last minute. If you're looking for a short fun series, I don't recommend it. It has absolutely no closure, with no sequel visible (even though it is strongly hinted).I have never felt so at war with myself when talking about B Gata H Kei. It has given me some of the best laughs, second to Nichijou, and it is a very interesting premise. \\n\\n\r\n*POSSIBLE SPOILERS FROM NOW ON**\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I absolutely cannot forgive the ending, it is what you're all expecting from it just from the ecchi tag, but it is far worse at the same time. It leads you on into false hope and snatches away what you've been watching the series for right in front of your eyes, over and over again. They throw up the typical road blocks that prevent what the fans want from happening WAY more than they should have, just to milk a second season. The series would have been a 9 had it ended the way it was pretending it would, but it didn't. This has left the most bitter taste in my mouth and I don't think I can ever forgive it for that.",

            "content": "Hm, I'm still looking for the reason why I watched this show. I always like anime with deep stories, psychological themes, mysteries or horror, and after that I watch some romantic tragedies that makes me bawl my eyes out. So when I read the synopsis for this anime, I didn't know why but something in my head went (YAS TAKE A BREAK FROM YOUR USUAL THING AND WATCH IT). And I followed that voice in my head that always get me in trouble and watched it.\r\nSTORY:\r\nBasically Yamada is a 15 yo highschooler, the prettiest in her highschool, gets good grades, popular, but there's one thingshe dislikes about herself : being a virgin. So her goal in this show is to get 100 sex buddies. \\n\r\nYou may think that the show will be filled with sex scenes or stuff, but I think the producers had one of those (HA! SURPRISE BITCH) moments and turned the show to something else.... a cute romance comedy. Here we meet Kosuda, the average clueless virgin shy guy, that is the first -and mind you,the last- target of Yamada. The show unfold their story as they struggle to find ... love? Sex? Lust ? One may never know.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nTo be really honest with you, I hated Yamada. Yes, sometimes I agreed with her and especially when she said (Love is supposed to make you happy, then why am I feeling this ...) but other than this line, she honestly can go and........ herself. She is stuck up, arrogant and sometimes annoying. Yeah, she may be nice at times but it's so rare. She didn't deserve Kosuda.\\n\r\nKosuda is your typical shy nice guy. He is in the photography club so he always has his camera with him. He doesn't understand girls at all and sometimes it is so funny.\\n\r\nMy favourite characters to be honest are the Sex Gods. They're what makes the show funny for the most part.\\n\r\nOther characters are Yamada's bff, that knows her motives, another violet haired girl that wanna be the school's queen, and the boys' squad that always talks about porn and girls.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nI can't lie, at times I enjoyed the show but what bugged me are the 'GOSH NO ! NOT AGAIN' moments that were so predictable. \\n\r\nIf you want to watch something cute, a bit funny just for the sake of pure enjoyment and because you have plenty of free time and nothing to do, then I recommend this. \\n\r\nBut if, like me, you want to watch something thats gonna open your eyes or that you're gonna remember for the next two years, then this is not for you unless you were bored.\\n\\n\r\nTHANKS FOR READING \ud83d\udc8b",

I must say that the last episodes are great gift from the anime makers as it has a lot of ecchi, giving the anime a nice ending. \r\nIt's not the greatest of school romance or ecchi genre, but it has a great amount of humor, so I would highly recommended.  \r\nWhat really makes this anime different from other is that the girl, Yamada, is trying to seduce her first victim toget laid. Get it, victim? But Yamada fails most of the time making it so funny. It's clearly one of the few anime were the girls is the one to just to bed openly, and I am not comparing to hentai. \\n\\n",

It does not condescend to its audience nor does it censor the jokes. It is raunchy and really funny. The story does a good job of drawing you in. Why is it not a ten? The story\u2019s problem comes from it belonging to two very different genres. In the ecchi genre the characters remain very static. The entertainment comes from putting these characters is bizarre situations. The problem arises when B Gata H Kei tries toalso be a \u201ccoming of age story\u201d in which character growth is necessary. Trying to make the characters unchanging (ecchi style) but also grow as people puts them in a limbo where they end up doing both in an unsatisfying manner. With this comes a mediocre ending. This multiple genre problem leads into\u2026.\\n\r\nCharacters: In a strictly ecchi setting these characters would be very entertaining. The problem arises when the story tries to give them the depth that is necessary for romance. They become a weird hybrid of shallow character tropes and three dimensional characters. This combination makes all the characters really unlikeable. It also makes the romance seem forced and fake.\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a funny and entertaining anime you won\u2019t be disappointed. If you want romance or anything deep you will be left hanging. \\n",

She plots to date her first lover but quickly discovers she's very much a novice and quite inexperienced in everything related to guys and dating.

Admittedly I did the same when i downloaded the first episode. Soon though it became clear that things were really going to be quite different, this isn't a raunchy attempt at fanservice (ie ikkitousen) behind all of the comedic antics theres actually an innocent romance, and to think they managed to keep that romance alive despite the nature of show is actually quite a feat in itself.So we begin with Kosuda your average high schooler, why he's just about as average as they come and Yamada san the crazy female lead who just happens to be on heat 24/7, Along the way other characters are introduced such as Kanejou san the stereotypically rich/flawless challenger to the female lead members of Kosudas family and other people at school also add to the atmosphere of the show.\\n\r\n             Why did i give this show an 8? No matter how generic it seems I actually liked the way it was written and how everything came together at the end, check the first couple of eps out , If you don't like them you probably won't like the rest, but for me this is one of the best shows in an all but dismal season of anime.",

            "content": "B Gata H Kei is a romantic/school/comedy that on the surface seems like a typical seinen-esque ecchi-filled anime, but B Gata H Kei actually breaks this mold fairly well.\r\nSTORY 7/10\r\nThe story takes a bit to start up, but it actually becomes really enjoyable not too far into it. For an anime that's focused around a high-school girl's desire to have sex, it's somewhat tame for the genre, mind you some fan-service is still thrown in. Instead it explores youth, relationships, and emotions. As the story progresses, it gets all the better as characters develop and new twists happen.\r\nART 6/10\r\nThe art is nothing too spectacular. Thenagain, it isn't bad either. It's suiting and quirky.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 5/10 \\n\r\nOne thing to note is that the sound was rather 'eh' in B Gata H Kei. The opening and closing numbers are both long and drab, the voice acting is generally good, but occasionally questionable. Other sound effects and music tracks are often repeated.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 7/10\\n\r\nB Gata H Kei does a really good job with the characters in it. The main characters actually are dynamic and show progression, unlike most animes of its genre. In it we watch Yamada, the main female protagnist, develop as she begins to learn more about 'love' after her pursuits to have sex. We watch the main antagonist (who to prevent spoilers, won't be given away) bring her own downfall. Overall, for its genre, it really accells here.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 7/10\\n\r\nWhile I'm not a normal viewer of the genre, B Gata H Kei stands out and proves itself to be a rather solid anime. With only 12 episodes, it's an easy and quick watch that all turns out fairly enjoyable. It's not something that I'd want to watch again, or something I'd talk about often, but definitley something that I enjoyed watching.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 7/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSIDE NOTES (SPOILER WARNINGS):\\n\r\nThere is one thing in this that caught my attention and I'm sure it has caused quite a controversy in it as it really sits in a 'gray' area. The characters' ages are around 15-17. As expected in an ecchi-based anime, especially one that's about a girl trying to lose her virginity, there is a lot of nudity-scenes, and while there is some fanservice, a lot of it is plot-oriented and usually censored and often humorized.\\n\r\nThat being said, it was really strange towards the end that they showed Yamada's breasts uncensored. While the anime implies time has past and they may be older, she is still underaged, and even in an anime about teenagers and pressure on teenagers with relationships and virginity, it still bothers me to some extent to see uncensored and underaged in the anime.\\n",

By the end Yamada changes a bit and the show becomes a little more serious. This anime has a lot of funny moments but can be serious in some parts that make you relate to the characters. This isn't your average Fan Service Ecchi. It's a romantic comedy first and the characters are great. The relationships between Yamada, Kosuda, and Tekashita are the best in the series. The only bad part of this anime is the last episode. It'ssplit into three sections and tends to drift too far away from the manga. \\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nLooks spectacular, the animations are clean and colors are sharp. Backgrounds can seem a little grainy at some parts but it's not much of a bother. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nGet ready for a lot of music, and I mean a lot. There's almost always some kind of background music playing.  Although the constant music can get annoying it matches the mood perfectly each time. Funimations dubbing was spectacular which is why I gave this such a high score. Yamada's voice was the best and it matches her character.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nThis anime's pace never gets dull, there's rarely any build up between the jokes and you'll be laughing through it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I liked this anime despite the fact I'm not really a fan of ecchi's but this one is different; it's funny, entertaining to watch, and it lacks fan-service panty-shots....until the last few episodes.  I would definitely recommend this anime and it's associated manga to anyone interested in ecchi.",

            "content": "When I first read the synopsis of this anime me and my friend thought it was a joke and so would be a fan serviced filled anime with mindless amounts of ecchi scenes, personally I am not a big fan of ecchi anime being more of a shojo/josei anime viewer myself. Anyway I decided to watch this anime as a joke, just to see how bad it really was but to my surprise it was very entertaining to watch (Because it was really funny ) despite the story being average at best and the music completely unmemorable. This anime is usually either a hit andmiss, but for a less mature audience it is probably going to be a very very entertaining watch.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nAt first the synopsis may put you off completely from watching B Gata H Kei, after all it does seem completely absurd (as the character wants to have sex with 100 men ._.)  and so it may be dismissed as something only an ecchi enthusiast would watch. In terms of story, the story is quite simple and at times cliche and downright banal. Pretty much it is about Yamada (the main character) trying to have sex with the male lead Kosuda and how she goes about trying to achieve it, it is unique in the sense that it is told from the perspective of a girl (who is planning on being promiscuous and has sexual thoughts running through her mind all the time). Nevertheless the story fails in some respects as it tends to be cliche due to the fact they are constantly interrupted just as they are about to kiss etc etc and that both leads are indecisive which can be frustrating to some viewers, but this is made up for due to the fact the series is very very funny.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nNot much to say about the art, it's decent and I don't think it will put anyone off the anime. One complaint I have is that Yamada is called the best looking girl in her school but she doesn't really look that good (this is subjective though)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is not memorable to say the least. But the one thing I did like was the Opening music, the opening music is just your typical high pitched girl singing but I still found it quite cute and catchy to listen to. As far as voice acting goes, there was nothing memorable about it, but they did a fine job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nI give this an 8 because I think Yamada is a  good character, this is mainly due to the fact that she is the star of the show and she's the one who makes the show what it is. She makes the show entertaining as it is often her actions and words which cause the viewer to laugh, which is, in my opinion, what the show is mostly about - Comedy. Other than Yamada though the anime suffers from a weak and unmemorable supporting cast as the attention is usually focused on Yamada. At times one maybe be able to empathize with the male lead Kosuda as his thoughts do have some semblance to what teenaged males would think but due to the fact that he is the \"Average Guy\"  he is mostly unmemorable too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nNow this is the section I'll give a 10 in. As I said before B Gata H Kei is a hit and miss, and it purely depends if you enjoy it right? The thing that makes B Gata H Kei what it is (which is entertaining) is the humor that is employed throughout the series - I showed my friend this anime and he was cracking up the whole time throughout the whole series. The anime is a hit and miss is because the comedy that is employed is more of a Dumb kind of funny rather than the Smart funny many people may be used to and so they tend to shun it as most of the times the jokes made are sex jokes and sleazy jokes and what not. Smarter people may not enjoy this series as much due to this, and indeed there are many people like that, so this series may not be for everyone in that respect. But personally I found B Gata H Kei a very fun anime to watch because of it's humor and the main lead Yamada and every episode I was left craving for more, I still wish there was a second season.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway I still feel guilty for liking this anime as me and my friend took it as a joke at first, but I'm glad I watched it. For all those people like me who only watch one genre (for me it's josei and shojo romance) I recommend you to take a break and try something new for once, or for anyone looking for laughs and a good time watch B Gata H Kei, I highly recommend it.",

            "content": "Where do I start with this anime? To be honest, I was really unsure while starting this anime, I rarely watch this genre of anime in the first place. \r\nLet's begin shall we? \r\nStory: 7/10\r\nWhen I first read the Summary I felt a sense of \"Why exactly am I going to watch this?\". The idea of a 15 year old girl wanting to have sex with 100 men seemed to be a bit far fetched, but none the less entertaining in it's own way. Not exactly something I would prefer, though. \r\nOne could argue that it's a pointless plot but in my opinion it makesfor an interesting story. Because to tell you the truth watching her fail at her goal and trying different ways of achieving it was indeed very funny. Through out the series the main character 'Yamada' tries to have her way with a certain boy named Kosuda, who happens to be a virgin just as she is. If you enjoy comedy Ecchi, then this series is for you \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10 \\n\r\nThe animation/art work of this series is very...Colorful, I'm sure that is apparent. Bright colors is commonly seen through out the show. To be honest though, I didn't see any part of the art work that really caught my eye and make me say \"That animation\" xD. \\n\\n\r\nThe style of the characters is very appealing, and it doesn't look disgusting. I've seen a few ecchi anime's. And some of them created a very, erm, distracting, form of animation. Over all I find the art work to be nice to look at and not overly flashy. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\n...I didn't exactly think that the music series was bad per say. But I didn't see anything that really stood out for me in a way that I would listen to it over and over. However, I will say that the theme song was very catchy. But really the sound wasn't very unique, it had a very moe kind of feeling to it. Which isn't exactly surprising given that it is an Ecchi anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nLET ME JUST SAY THESE CHARACTERS ARE FUNNY AS HELL. \\n\\n\r\nNone of the characters that I have met in this series have been boring, dull, had no personality, or do nothing. The amount of character development in this series is fabulous as well. I feel the need to mention this considering the plot line. You'd expect the main character to be sorta slutish (Forgive me for using that term .-.) and vain. But it's the opposite. \\n\\n\r\nYamada is very nervous and self conscious, like as mentioned in the series a few times she thinks her vagina looks weird. I like how they treated her character and showed it in a very realistic way. When it comes to some one's first time having sex people aren't confident that they will do well, they don't really know what they are doing and are self conscious about their body. Yamada was a very realistic character. \\n\\n\r\nFor this I give kudos to the person who came up with Yamada's character, and also with the rest of the characters too. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10 \\n\r\nThis anime was very enjoyable to me, but not really on my top list of favorite anime's. It's funny, romantic, fanservicey and really a mix of ecchi. \\n\\n\r\nOver all: 6/10 \\n\r\nI feel a little harsh giving it a 6, but to be honest I think that is what it deserves. Maybe it's because I'm not really a huge fan of Ecchi comedies. However I would indeed recommend this anime to anyone who is into this sort of thing. I do seem to find myself watching it over and over again. \\n\\n\r\nAll though I would not suggest buying it (In my opinion it's not really worth it). Streaming it would be a good thing to go for. It's available on pretty much every anime site and it's on netflix as well. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, when it comes to the dub. I personally don't see anything wrong with it. I am usually the kind of person who prefers dub, but I know when a bad dub comes along. If you watch it subbed or dubbed it's up to you, but if you are a person who prefers dub like me, the dub is just fine. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this, enjoy the anime :)",

            "content": "Now, you may be thinking: \"What the heck? Why would you EVER give this series a 10? It's SO cheesy! It's full of stupid meta jokes and there is no real substance--just ecchi humor geared towards teenagers!\" However, I am here to voice MY opinion on the show. This is my review of B Gata H Kei: Yamada's First Time almost directly after I've watched it the second time. I watched it for the first time in spring 2014 and now I have watched it once more in early spring 2016.\r\nLet me start with my qualification for my rating of the art and sound (a9).\\n\\n\r\nI am not qualified at all to evaluate the art quality of the show. I can't draw, let alone write neatly. However, the art style managed to appropriately complements the atmosphere of the show at any given moment, fitting in with the feeling of playfulness and hilarity when it came about and then wistfulness and melancholy when that came about. I found the over-exaggerated facial expressions to be a bit weird sometimes, but I think that's more of me growing up from the first time I watched the show. It fed into the hilarity, anyway. Also, the censorship of Kosuda's penis was one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time.\\n\r\nAs for the sound, I am a bit more qualified, for I have worked with audio both in music and general audio engineering for over four years at this point. I have to say that the sound effects were hilarious and I absolutely loved the silly background music. I also really enjoyed the laments that played when there was a sad or conflicting moments... they felt very real. I have no complaints on the voice acting; I liked how everyone sounded.\\n\\n\r\nI will now move on to the rest of the criteria, which I have rated all a 10.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first watched this show, I had not experienced any super-awkward first time. I had never had a super-magical experience with a person that left me confused and frightened and nervous and yet, ecstatic. However, now that I have, my view on this show has changed dramatically. I once thought that the show was a cute rendition of what life as a teenager was really like. I thought that it was funny and cute and a tease for its ending, but now, I see this show more for what it really is. It's more than a cute, embarrassing comedy. It's my experience as a teenager.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I rewatched this a couple days ago, I almost started crying multiple times in the middle of a couple of episodes. This was because it reminded me of what my life felt like when I first fell in love. I remember feeling apprehension and denial yet eagerness for what could possibly happen the next day when I saw that person who made my chest felt light. I remember the awkwardness of the first time and how much ridiculous planning teenagers might have to put in (especially when they really, actually care about the person). I am no longer with the person I mentioned before, and so this show served as a reminder of how great and magical my life was. I remember the beginning of that relationship as the most amazing, shiny, perfect time of my life. The feelings that both Yamada, the show's protagonist, and Kosuda, the show's co-protagonist, feel are very real and they are experiences I had. Jealousy, love, wistfulness, lust, sadness, and despondence are all things that come together in the search for a wholesome relationship, and I remember it. \\n\\n\r\nNow, with all that said, I give the characters a 10 just because there are real-life parallels for all of the major ones. You have the two (possibly unlikely) lovebirds, the supportive and guiding friend, the group of doubtful bystanders (especially in the culture of boys), the people who interfere and cause each lovebird to get jealous, and, of course, the driving force of their motives. All of these characters make true-to-life appearances and really make this show feel real.\\n\\n\r\nI gave the story a 10 because it's really what happens. That kind of progression of emotions does happen. It's so accurate to the young teenage experience that it almost perfectly parallels mine (and I mean it! Down to almost the last detail!).  It's exciting, funny, attractive, depressing, and ultimately, relatable. I loved and still love it.\\n\\n\r\nI gave the enjoyment a 10 for obvious reasons--I was invested the whole time, both times I watched it. I never got bored. It never ceased to suck me in and pluck my heartstrings in both happy and sad ways.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a 10. The combination of relatable realism in the teenage high-school experience, fitting music, characters who don't feel fake and acted, and a sense of humor so self-aware that it puts the antagonists of I, Robot to shame makes this anime series one of my absolute favorites so far (and I don't think I'll ever consider it otherwise). I love it so much. This show embodies the true emotional rollercoaster that is high-school.\\n\\n\r\nB Gata H Kei,\\n\r\nCounterpart2001,\\n\r\nForever.",

            "content": "Being honest, the first time I heard of this anime I kinda frowned. Being more of a conservative man, I did not find that it would be nice to see a girl planning on having sex with 100 guys.\r\nBut well, I gave it a chance and by the first 5 minutes I was laughing my ass off and relating to all of the situations.\r\nStory wise you should expect a typical romantic comedy.\r\nSpeaking of the art, it was good, it had some CG for like making fire and stuff, was enjoyable.\r\nThe op and ed were good, they had me smiling and singing along. I added themto my playlists, and it is good that I can listen to them on their own and remember the good time I had with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were all very likable, standart teens driven by lust sometimes (but hey, we all have been like that sometimes).\\n\r\nThe main cast Yamada and Kosuda at first looked like they had nothing in common but as we go trough the episodes we realize the are very like the same. \\n\r\nAlso there are some others that could count as \"main\" characters, and don't get me wrong, they were good. But I just wanted to see the main couple be together and some of them tended to interfier.\\n\r\nI remember some of the side characters being really likeable (like that little chick who had the body of a little girl, but also had all her hopes up all the time, she made me laugh a lot)\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the hell out of this anime. It might have been becouse I've lived all of the akward situations in my teen years and remember then being the same as they were potrayed. If you had have this interactions with the other sex you might find it as enjoyable as I had.\\n\\n\r\nWish it could have another season or something, all that its left to the story is the manga, but I dont like the designs used in it. But hey, the anime was fun as f*ck and I loved it. Give it a chance \\n",

            "content": "B-gata H-Kei is exactly what you would expect from your typical ecchi romance anime. That's basically it.\r\nThe premise of this anime is actually quite interesting and different. I would go as far as to call it fairly daring, considering it's quite hard to pull off (Which is very visible in the anime itself, sadly). It's basically about a girl who wants to have sex with 100 guys as quickly as possible, even though she is not experienced at all. Now I personally don't enjoy ecchi too much, but this premise made me give this one a shot anyway.\r\nThe art is alright, though a bit dated.It'll do for a story like this, but it isn't very impressive. The sound however is quite mediocre, and I'd say that it refrains from using anything interesting, which makes the entire track quite forgetful.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are where the anime breaks it for me though. To not spoil anything, aside from our main protagonist we have 'the first guy to have sex with' who play a main role in this anime. The thing is, that even though our main girl has a set goal, as explained in the premise of this story, she immediately ditches it because she is too shy (somehow suddenly?). Therefore it is hinted that she is in love with this bland guy even though she has no reason to be. The guy itself is extremely emotionless, and just reacts to everything the same way. Even though the anime itself is quite short (12 episodes) there is basically no character development at all, even though there relationship somehow improves. This makes little sense to me, but maybe I'm being harsh, that's for you to judge.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the enjoyment was pretty good though, you can certainly watch it for a bit of comedy. The jokes are executed well and even though I never laughed out loud, there were some slight nose exhales here and there. If you love ecchi, you want to give this one a shot, otherwise I can only recommend it if you have no other comedies to watch. The romance is quite poor, and they stepped back on the interesting premise, but you can still enjoy it, and I suppose that's what it's about.\\n",

I have since re-watched this anime many times. I love the way the developed yamada's character, but still maintaining the crazy factor in the character's personality. I love the art style but i don't think it was allowed to be expressed fully as can be seen in the OP as you can see how water was animated. Overall, this anime is downright hilarious as the main character yamada is aperverted female rather than the typical male protagonist, this leads to lots of laughs and some unique scenes not found anywhere else because yamada is the pursuer.  Great anime, great voice acting from English and Japanese actors, great characters. 10/10\\n",

            "content": "Warnin':\r\n'Tis probable spoilers will occur ye wombat so walk away if ye care bout 'em\r\nAnnouncement:\r\nI'll be doing this new form of reviews instead of segmented ones.\r\nAh feels good to write reviews again. After I went trough a dozen of animes,which had nothin' to write home about, this gem popped up. Well not as much popped as recommended by a friend. It is not 'til I saw couple of episodes that I've noticed the gem was made out of plastic and food coloring.\r\nNow that intro might've made you think I despise this anime and you'd be wrong to think so you silly slacker. I most certainlydon't understand the appeal of ecchi animes but I guess some people just really like being blue balled for twenty minutes. Maybe it's a Japanese thing, maybe you need samurais and two nukes in your country's history to understand the appeal of it. Anyhow B Gata H Kei is a story about a fifteen year old girl who wants to shag a hundred guys during her time in highschool,I guess story goes for the realistic portrayal of fifteen year old girls. This does not mean she wants to do 'em in highschool,tho that would certainly liven up history lessons. The problem with this story is that it quickly turns into a generic romance. It checks couple of cliches during it's run. There's also a tsundere aspect to the female lead. Despite her being so keen to nom on some German sausage she gets extremely shy when it comes to instigating it with male lead. Speaking of him he'd probably be a background character in any other anime considering his lack of personality traits,wait actually that'd put him as a protagonist of a shounen all he needs is to shoot lasers. He's shy of course but it doesn't help much that female lead behaves like she's on a constant sugar rush. Whenever she talks to him it ends up as incoherent yelling. In couple of cases she berates him for being too slow with groping her tits. Yes you heard me well there's tiddies in here so if that's nuff for ya you can just stop readin'. In truth when they are closest to sex is when anime is the best. See this anime sells itself as a comedy but humor is pretty repetitive and generic. ,,Look at this pretentious asshole over here'', the villagers yell, ,,are titty jokes not good enough for you?''. Nope I've laughed at quite a number of titties in my life and problems aren't what they are joking about. Indeed jokes would be funny if comedic timing and execution weren't so bad, also I would be a good person if not for my apathy and disdain for humankind. But again during near sex scenes humor goes up with some interesting imagery, wink wink nudge nudge. Overall humor is hit and miss, more miss than hit.  It is also a romance,as you might've assumed, and it fares better in that department. Even though it contains a number of cliches, like male lead having a childhood friend that likes him and there being a girl who likes her older brother, it's certainly better than many others and I'll tell you why in a jiffy. See in the beginning female lead is only after male one cause she wants her first time to be with a virgin. However trough these twelve episodes she starts liking him for what he is, more or less. The thing tho is that characters in this anime are pretty eh. Eh in a manner that most of them don't partake much in anything. They all have one joke tied to them. For example there's a short, flat chested girl who wants to have a boyfriend really bad but nobody wants to date her and there's a classic clumsy girl who apologises a lot. Art is good. It's not too plain as some other things I've reviewed so I gotta pet it for that. Sound is basic and that opening makes me nauseous.\\n\r\n Enjoyment is certainly present in this claptrap tho if you've already seen a decent amount of shoujo animes, which to a normal human being is below two, you won't find much new. I'd like to note tho that this is not what I consider good. Writing overall was pretty poor and seemed to repeat itself a lot. It still has that stinky air of by the book anime intersected with couple of lines that diverge from the norm. There's not a point where I felt engaged with the story to the point I actually focused on the screen. Better luck next time whoever wrote this.",

Not the worst, but just not the best. \r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe story was indeed ridiculous, I have to admit, but I liked it nonetheless. Wanting to have sex with 100 guys right as you get into high school. The only real problem is... it doesn't seem to go anywhere with the story premise. It had a unique idea, but it just didn't really use it. \r\nArt: 7/10\r\nThis art style fits this story quite well. The face that the simplecharacter designs compliment the smooth animation show that this was intended from the beginning. It isn't something I'd remember forever, but it certainly was a nice show to look at while it lasted.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI adored the sound in B Gata H Kei, and for good reason. With people like Yoku Shioya and Junpei Fujita, your sound is going to be pretty good. Shioya was known for Sound Director of Welcome to the NHK as well as voicing Ryota Miyagi from Slam Dunk, while Fujita worked on some of my favorite theme song arrangements. Those include: Rosario + Vampire, Mirai Nikki OP2, and all of the music for all the Grisaia series. Their skills are apparent and make the sound very enjoyable. And the OP; just a great time!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this show really killed the experience for me. They are just... dull. They're not all that likable, as none of them you can really relate to. None of the characters are ones that people will remember forever and ever, as they just aren't really fleshed out properly. And because of this, the characters feel incomplete. It's even harder to enjoy watching because you know less than you thought you knew. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI did not particularly enjoy myself watching this show at all. It just felt like watching another average ecchi show, but with no ecchi. It felt like it was trying to emulate an ecchi show to me. I wouldn't consider re-watching this show, unless I needed to do a new review on it. And nothing is very memorable at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nLike I said before, not the worst, but certainly not the best. It could have used some changes on a few things, and maybe it would have turned into a solid 8.",

If Yamada wanted to get laid it's not that hard, Even in sexually repressed nation like Japan.\r\nAudio\t\r\nThe only thing I want to mention here is this series has one of the mostannoying theme songs I've heard in years.\\n\r\nVideos\t\\n\r\nTop notch",

            "content": "First of all, let me start off with these few words; Stereotypical romance anime. It has the average pedophile character, the love shy guy, if i were to compare it to another anime i would choose Girls Bravo. It builds up and up and up, and at the pinnacle of the series, right when everything you've been waiting for is about to go down, a simple little accident happens and nothing goes down and the series ends. Walla. I was pretty disappointed with the last episode. My apologies, but i shan't show spoilers! Though i find it rather obvious what DOESN'T happen :/ All inall it was a good anime. Average at best. Character design was fantastic. Censorship was right on line. (Especially at the end :) Oh right! The comedy! IT. WAS. HILARIOUS :D  There were a ton of sexual puns. Each funnier than the last. My favorite line was quote \"All you're after is man hymen\", \" 'laugh' Man hymen\" Very funny not to say the least. If your looking for a love romance that leaves you hanging, check it out. I'm expecting a second season. Slightly more towards the hentai side of things.",

But this story lacked an actual thoughtful plot. It's about Yamada 15 year old girl wanting to get laid by 100 men. I probably would've enjoyed it more if I wasn't a girl and this anime portraying girls like an absolute slut. The characters are very poorly portrayed. And the main character is one of the most annoying anime character ever. I suggest you don't watch it if you're a girl because it canbe very offensive at times and dude if you like hardcore fighting anime you probably won't like this anime..!",

The story was very \"unique\" you could say. Basically its about some pretty highschool girl that wants to have sex with a 100 people but she has never been in a realationship before. The plot became irrelvant really quickly and just was about how awkward the relationship could get between the two main characters  \r\nThe art was the highpoint of the show with well drawn characters and some nice looking art for the environment. But overall theart was still just okay especially when compared to higher budget shows. \\n\\n\r\nSound was decent i guess the soundtrack was okay if you like J-pop i guess.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were lackluster with very little characterization and were all pretty generic except the main heroin. \\n\\n\r\nThe show was somewhat enjoyable with some very funny scenarios but was kind of just boring at times. The amount of ecchi in this show was pretty standard for the genre. \\n\\n\r\nOverall if you love the ecchi genre you will most likely like this show. But for everyone else this will be a waste of time.",

BGHK's story slays these dragons with ease. The story pours mountains of comedy onto you in the form of dirty dialogue and embarrassing situations. Ecchi is always supported of course by our female lead trying to burn her v-card realizing she has no idea what she's doing; and the romance that develops will exceed your expectations. The characters are adorable and shy without becoming annoying like these characteristics tend to become. The male MC was pretty dull but the restof the characters make up for it well. Yamada is so nuts it's beautiful! There's no problem with the artistic vision of this anime. The coolest thing about each episode is it felt like you were watching 2 every time. You'll see what I mean. The soundtrack is adorable and the intro is soooooo catchy. I loved it. Bottom line is, if you're looking for something cute and funny to watch that is similar to Rosario+Vampire then this is for you. Enjoy!\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Correct amount of fanservice. Not too much and not too little.\\n\r\n-Cute and adorable story.\\n\r\n-Positive vibes.\\n\r\n-Extremely funny!\\n\r\n-Catchy soundtrack/intro.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Not quite the ending you want.\\n\\n",

It was unexpectedly enjoyable, despite it's extremely perverted nature. i especially am surprised Yamada and Kosuda went so far without the whole ''plan'' backfiring. Yamada, in my opinion, is a very ''special'' character. She has very ''interesting'' ambitions. Regardless, her ambitions did trigger many of the funny moments. Kosuda is a very ''unique'' character as well. Perverted, yet so dense. (Oh so VERY dense). There were moments where i did think that Miyano deserved Kosuda,but then I thought ''Kosuda is exactly what Yamada needs to balance out her personality''. Overall, I really think this anime is worth watching, and many of it's twists can make your blood run. I'm really hoping a second season will be developed.",

It is also very original, this is the first series I have seen where the main character is a hot and perverted girl, its usually one or the other. This show is so damn ridiculous, it makes fun of EVERYTHING about romantic comedies, from the stereotypical rich pretty boy to hot high school girls. It is definitely a show worth anybody's time. And the jokes in the show also never gets old, even though it is repeated through out the series. The show is never bland,and it stays as perverted as ever all the way through. I can't really find that many big flaws in this one, but at times it does make it feel like having sex in highschool is mandatory for anyone who isn't ugly. This show is definitely worth watching though, it is ridiculously funny and perverted, but it also has its sweet moments. For the main part though, it is mostly funny and perverted, which I love, man shit, this show is awesome.",
