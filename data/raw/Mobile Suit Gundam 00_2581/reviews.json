            "content": "I don't remember what it was at first that drew me to Gundam 00, because I ended up in love with it all too fast, which is why I'll try my hardest to toss aside any bias. \r\nI haven't seen any of the previous Gundams, I knew about them of course, but never actually sat down and watched them. Partly because 00 had a more sleek art style and partly because the instant contradictions within the plot and characters intrigued me. \r\nThis review may contain hints of spoilers, but nothing explicit and flat out. \r\nSTORY- The story is political, to say the least. Because thisis the first season, there's a lot of focus on why things are the way they are, the factions and their goals, observing them discuss, ect. I admit it's a little hard to keep up with sometimes once you feel it start to drone on. Thankfully, it's not that long, and just long enough to get the point across. What interested me the most was a point that was shown through the relationship between Setsuna and Marina. Celestial Being is trying to eradicate war, as they say, but they are fighting to do that. That itself is a huge contradiction, one that isn't ignored by the characters themselves. Setsuna in particular I remember musing over it. Marina on the other hand seeks peace, creating a good-hearted light of hope in all of the violence. The whole thing is very realistic and that was a drawing point. This isn't an alternate universe, this is a version of an imagined future.\\n\\n\r\nART- Again I'll say it, the sleek art is what drew me the most to 00. I'd seen the previous gundams, but never watched them because the designs nor the style caught me. The character designs themselves are very nice. A crazy crayola crayon box, but nice. Mobile animations and designs were done very fluidly and detailed. If anything, it's not an ugly show to watch at all. It's not full of big eyed girls with moe attitudes, there's a varied female design throughout. Same could be said for the males. While the girl designs feel more futuristic, the boys somehow feel more earthy to me. Still- that's just me.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND- No one's tracked how many times I've raved about 00's OP and EDs. They are the absolute best I've ever seen. The lyrics, the accompanying animation and the whole exhibition of it is produced beautifully. I'm one of those people who normally skip over OPs after so long and never really watch EDs, but every single time I watched both in 00. The soundtrack in itself isn't very noticeable nor memorable, though that didn't bother me much. I was too preoccupied with the OPs and EDs still, because I can't imagine such a string of beauty throughout a whole anime season for anything other than 00.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER- This is the point I have to strongly fight that bias. The hugest thing that kept me watching the series was the characters, who I found a relief from all the others that seem to be popping up. The relationships between them, the backgrounds... learning about the characters was a bit slow paced, but rewarding all the same. None of the meisters have had easy pasts. Allelujah finds himself fighting with a split personality from experimentation. Setsuna gained his cold and unaffectionate demeanor from his life as a child soldier. Tieria, an exceptionally mysterious character, isn't what you'd call fully human. Then even the guy who would light up the room with his smile, Lockon, carried a hatred for terrorists within his heart that clouded his judgement. \\n\\n\r\nAll of them bond. All of them grow closer without saying anything. Lockon in particular is to thank for these growths, because he is truly the shining light of the show. The one who unites all the others, smiling to help them grow. It's hard not to become attached to his magnetic personality, like him or hate him. Then there are the more minor parts of CB, including a socially awkward young girl who doesn't know how to express herself to people and finds solace in robotics, an alcoholic strategic who never misses a chance to have a drink, a friendly young adult woman who, despite the dreariness she's surrounded with, manages to keep an upbeat and sociable attitude. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course there are the antagonists, as well as everyone else. It's quite a cast. The Trinity siblings I felt, didn't get nearly enough screen time, being introduced more than ten episodes into the series, but they were dynamic. They shook up things wherever they went, and were nothing but a joy to see. Never dull. Nena Trinity, the youngest, does an excessively violent act late in the season that truly exhibits the sibling's ruthlessness. The antagonists were intriguing, but they too, I wished had more screen time to really let the viewers get a better feel. All the relationships were so complicated- it made the two civilians, Saji and Louise, stand out like a sore thumb in the cast. Very fun comic relief and a chance to see what's happening through a civilian's point of view. Ultimately, while the two may not seem important, gradually they gain almost the most character development throughout the cast, surprisingly enough. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT AND OVERALL- If you can sit through some politics, enjoy having your morals questioned and are willing to keep an open mind, it's a fantastic series and I recommend it. As many have said- it's an excellent gundam series to start off with.",

            "content": "Mobile Suit Gundam 00 is yet another addition to Sunrise's long running metaseries Mobile Suit Gundam, as well as the newest in the line of alternative universe Gundams. In a franchise as big as Gundam, it's very easy to get overshadowed by predecessors and living up to the namesake of Gundam is tough. After so many series, it's hard not to recycle the same material and Gundam 00 is no exception. But its unique execution and incorporation of realistic issues going on in this world makes this a series worth checking out by both long time fans and newcomers.\r\nStory\r\nThe premise of Mobile Suit Gundam 00focuses on the paramilitary organization/force known as Celestial Being, and their idealistic goal towards eradicating war through violence itself. Much like fighting fire with fire, the controversial goal of Celestial Being is embodied through mobile suits known as &quot;Gundams&quot; and their armed interventions.\\n\\n\r\nPitting a paramilitary force and its overpowered mobile suits against the world, you basically get a massive serving of shiny mech to mech action. Not exactly the most innovative. The story's essentially set up so the show can have as many mobile suit battles as possible; and frankly, that isn't a bad thing as long as it's toppled with good characters and drama. It's a decent story, but it's lacking some of the military aspects that Gundam is known for.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the main story, there's also a subplot involving two characters named Saji and Louise. Their purpose is to basically show the viewer the civilian standpoint of    Celestial Being's fight against the world's three superpowers. Which is probably the show's only source of slight comic relief and lightheartedness.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation\\n\r\nThe character designs of the four main Meisters are all quite well done. Much like Gundam Wing, the main characters are all pretty boys. Besides the main characters, we also have our blonde antagonist Graham whose appearance all-around gives the vibe of an ace pilot. Female designs are also done very well, such as Marina, who, though young, gives off a very motherly appearance; a very important aspect regarding her role in the plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe Mecha designs of Gundam 00 is very unique in that they're not rehashes of mobile suits from previous series. Gundam Exia (AKA the main main Gundam) offers a very simplistic and futuristic design; in fact, that goes to all the other mobile suit designs in this series. So unlike the Strike Freedom, the Gundams don't have a million things on their backs and enemies don't look overdone as if they were meant to sell model kits. The Mecha designs in 00 are, in my opinion, some of the best in the Gundam metaseries.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this series is absolutely stunning. You wouldn't find a prettier anime on this planet. Gundam 00 contains some of the most fluid Mecha action I've ever seen. The likes only rivaled by another Sunrise mech, Code Geass R2. Everything in this series is animation gold, from the shading and facial expressions of characters to the GN drive emitting  particles from the Gundams. It should be noted that there are some minor slip-ups, but they're passable and like mentioned, minor.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound (speaking of music, not sound effects)  in 00 is probably the weakest part of the entire series. This is one of the few things that its predecessor, SEED, is by far superior in. The soundtrack isn't necessarily bad, it just doesn't bring out the mood as effectively as it should. Though there are some great background music such as Fight, Counterattack, and Union. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP's and ED's on the otherhand are fantastic. Unlike SEED, new openings use different animation and things are actually MOVING and isn't a slideshow of pictures.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters in Gundam 00 are.. interesting. Can't say the score eight is definite as the second season hasn't aired yet. But judging solely on the first season, the characters are all quite reserved if not emotionless. Setsuna, being the main character, has a very interesting if not bloody background to him. Tieria is mysterious and strict, Allelujah is a character struggling with his mind, and Lockon  is easygoing and likable, though he harnesses a deep hatred towards terrorists.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters include the Char-like ace pilot Graham, war-loving Ali Al Saachez, and Human Reform League veteran soldier Sergei Smirnov.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast in general is a good cast, the characters aren't anything we haven't seen in Gundam before, but maybe that's a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nIt's an enjoyable series, especially towards the end. The Mecha action will glue you to the screen, the characters will make you empathize, and old time Gundam fans will have fun comparing it to Wing and/or finding the Char clone. The show also carries the 'Kill em all' kind of ending done by Director Yoshiyuki Tomino, something UC fans may fancy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nGundam 00 is by no means a deep show, it's the Gundam you know and love, with the usual war themes and ideology; all wrapped up in HD goodness. For newcomers, Gundam 00 is a fantastic introduction to the franchise. All-around it's a solid show. Gundam 00 proves once again how sitting in a cockpit while shouting out morals and personal philosophies is a win-win formula even after almost thirty years since its debut.\\n\\n\r\nGeneral impression, summary, and thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nStory: B+ :  A storyline you would expect from a mecha geared towards the Shounen demographic.\\n\\n\r\nArt &amp; Animation: A+ :  Good interesting mecha and character designs, fluid mecha action.\\n\\n\r\nSound: B :  Weak, forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: B+ :  The characters are there, they get developed but overall it's more plot-driven.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: B+ :  Another solid installment to the Gundam franchise, a promising ending setting up for the second season.",

            "content": "Sunrise seems to have a habit of producing series that simultaneously contain things I really like and things I really hate. In the end, the question always becomes which there's more of.\r\nSTORY - Sometimes, it's easy to become jaded with the Gundam franchise; it's always another war and another group of over-powered mechs piloted by super-capable teenagers. Each series seems to have its own unique set of deviations though, and that's undoubtedly why the franchise has survived for as long as it has. In 00's case, it's interesting to note that there's no clear-cut war between two factions. The world's existing conflicts are a mixof terrorism, civil war, and totalitarian oppression. Though morals are still cited a lot, there's no clear-cut definition of &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil,&quot; and our protagonists admit up front that they aren't necessarily &quot;good.&quot; Some of the politics are eerily similar to some real life current events, but it wasn't clear enough to me whether they were actually trying to make a statement about something or whether it was mostly coincidence. There are also some religious and environmental messages tossed into the mix, but again, not sure if any of it was supposed to be legitimate commentary. If anything though, Sunrise plays good politics.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonists, the paramilitary organization Celestial Being, declares its purpose to be the eradication of all war, and it aims to do so by intervening with all armed conflicts with their over-powered Gundams... and that's where the ground starts getting shaky. I never really thought the &quot;war to end all wars&quot; thing had much logic to it, but I can still enjoy a show with that sentiment at its core if the storytelling is all right and if events still seem to unfold logically. But Celestial Being was founded two hundred years prior to the events of the series, and all of their technology was developed then. And yet somehow, they are still mad over-powering against armies built on recent technology? Seriously? Realism does not compute. It's frustrating that not a lot is ever said/explained/discovered about the organization's origins throughout the course of the series, and I really don't understand the need for 00 to be split into two seasons. I don't buy that it's just the four year timeskip because Gurren Lagann proved that you could have a hugely significant timeskip mid-series no problem. \\n\\n\r\nFor the record, I hated the ending of this first season. It goes along fine for a while, but then we get this supremely rushed-feeling, arbitrary, and cobbled-together series of events that seemed to serve little purpose beyond hitting some sort of end-point for the season. And the thing I hate the most about Sunrise? Faked character deaths. Zombie characters. They're notorious for it, yes. No body means no death in Sunrise, but knowing this doesn't make it any less infuriating every time they do it. The Zombie problem alone made me disinclined to care about the second season, especially since I felt like they could have legitimately ended the series at 25 episodes if they had cut out a thus far pointless subplot and replaced it with relevant information about Celestial Being. Oh, Sunrise...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - Ensemble casts always wrestle with the problem of underdeveloped characters, and this is especially problematic in 00. It took me a really long time (probably at least ten episodes, which is way too long) to get into the characters and to care about them, and even then, my interest was limited. Of the four pilots, Setsuna's past is expanded upon the most, and I found it interesting the way the viewers' perception of him changed the more we learned even though Setsuna himself doesn't start to grow/change much until the near-end of the season. Allelujah's character and past isn't terribly inspired, but I think the acting really helped to garner audience sympathy to his case, and I liked the way his split personality was portrayed through reflections. \\n\\n\r\nLockon probably has the most terrible name pun ever (though H/Allelujah is pretty bad too), but I can live knowing that it's only a code name. That aside, he was probably the most generic of the pilots. Easy-going, friendly, righteous, and all that. Nothing special...except that his Haro is probably the most ridiculously adorable incarnation of a Haro ever. I also really appreciated the fact that there was some age disparity between the pilots. Setsuna is sixteen. Lockon is twenty-four. Everyone isn't a fifteen year-old kid! Oh, and Tieria? We never learn anything about Tieria, so I didn't really care about him at all. Sure, there's a whole 'nother season to explain things in, but I shouldn't need to wait that long to care. It's always a problem if I don't care about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters... ugh, there are just too many of them, and I didn't care about any of them. There were too many characters trying to play puppetmaster and making brief, unexplained appearances every few episodes, and none of them seem to have an interesting motivation or ambition. I am tired of characters trying to take over the world, and I'm sure you are too. Even Celestial Being's founder felt like he was trying to force the world into something... Marina Ismail? She was generic to the point that I had no sympathy for her for that reason alone. Graham Akre? I don't care about your vengeance-driving bullshit. Ali Al-Saachez? Don't care. Super Soldier #1? Whatever. The worst of it was the gigantic subplot involving the civilian characters. Their scenes were awkwardly woven into the politics, morals, and action, and I was thoroughly annoyed with all of it. Most likely, this subplot will lead up to something that (might hopefully kind of) be relevant in the second season, but that's too long of a build-up for me.\\n\\n\r\nARTSTYLE &amp; ANIMATION - The animation in 00 is pretty top notch. The mecha battles are slick, clean, and super entertaining to watch. The Gundam designs are fun and unique, and I'm especially fond of Exia (come on, anything with seven blades has to be badass). The other mech designs, as well as the battleship designs, are also pretty neat. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I found the character designs to be a bit lacking. Aside from Tieria's overt androgyny, I appreciated that they didn't have crazy wild appearances, and it is neat that many of the characters are supposed to be of different nationalities, but in the end, it's just supposing. If they never mentioned that Lockon is Irish, that Setsuna is Kurdish, that Saji is Japanese, you'd never know. Especially among the female characters, I felt like I'd seen them all before. Generic political figures, generic princesses, generic prettyboys. It didn't help that I had a hard time distinguishing some characters from others for a good five or six episodes; blame it on my own crappy memory and incompetence, but even so.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - Well, I'm pretty biased towards both opening themes for 00. As a L'Arc~en~Ciel fan, I loved &quot;Daybreak's Bell&quot; long before I ever saw this series, and as I'm currently on a Tomoko Kawase kick thanks to Soul Eater's second opening, I've come to really love &quot;Ash Like Snow&quot; as well. They're both great songs though, and I always love when the lyrics feel relevant to the actual series. The end themes didn't feel as exciting in contrast, but once again, it could just be my bias towards the two bands doing the openings. (Actually, I found the first end theme, &quot;Wana,&quot; to be pretty annoying...)\\n\\n\r\nThe background music for the series pales in contrast to its theme songs, as well as previous Gundam series like SEED, and other Sunrise mecha series like Code Geass. Very few tracks stood out to me during the series; the few that did were generally battle themes, but even those were pretty subpar. It wasn't terrible music, so it didn't really take away from the experience, but I'm sure a lot of scenes would have been better had there been a more emotional or meaningful soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING - Pretty average for the most part. Allelujah has a very unique-sounding and emotional voice; I think that's one of the reasons I warmed up to his character, and Setsuna was interesting in that he's one of the first monotone-voiced characters that didn't seriously annoy me. I appreciate the versatility of Miyano's voice -- it's very easy to distinguish his many roles. Beyond that, none of the other characters really stood out to me. Nothing amazing, but each character had a voice that suited them perfectly well.\\n\\n\r\nEdit; I saw one episode of the English dub (episode #11). Overall, it was pretty lulz-worthy. Tieria and Lockon both sound better than I expected, but they still feel awkward and unnatural, particularly Tieria, though I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that many of his lines are kind of corny. Setsuna didn't have a very big role in the episode, but the few lines he did have also impressed me. Swalie's voice is much more versatile than I thought. Cox on the other hand... Allelujah sounds terrible. The voice doesn't suit him at all and really made him seem like an entirely different character. Hallelujah is passable, but Allelujah fails utterly. Much of the secondary cast feels just as awkward, sadly: both Graham Akre and Billy Katagiri are very lulzy; Feldt and Marina are super generic, as are Col. Smirnoff and Soma; Sumeragi is actually pretty okay, but it can't be hard to sound &quot;okay&quot; when everyone else is just so... wtf. I don't think I'll be watching any more of the dub. The &quot;sound&quot; score component is not affected by the dub.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - I think this review might have turned out a bit more negative than I intended just because I'm still annoyed with the season's ending. You might wonder what I actually liked about 00. Well, I enjoyed the story and main conflict for the most part. It's always good to see a blurring of good and evil, especially when characters try so hard to convince themselves that they're doing the right thing. If I could score this series somewhere between a 7 and an 8, I would. 7 feels a bit harsh, but 8 feels too generous. I think 00's main problem is just that there are too many little details to the plot and few of them are explained properly; similarly, there are too many characters, and none of them get the attention they deserve. The intense build-up for the second season leaves this first season pretty void of substance, which is really disappointing. If you're going to divide up your forces, divide them evenly, huh? \\n\\n\r\nI'll see how this second season goes though, but Zombie characters isn't a really great place to start if you ask me.",

            "content": "maybe you've read it from somewhere or heard it before but let me state it again, Gundam 00 makes me reminiscent of Gundam Wing, one of the best Gundam series (in my opinion) with regards to story, character, and mechas.\r\nHowever, Gundam 00 have developed its own form of respect that made it surpass some other Gundam series in its own field.\r\nfor one, this is the best series so far that excelled much in art style, making efficient use of modern day technology to improve the graphic quality of this anime. from the sleek coloring and the defined mech designs, i believe that this series reeledit in.\\n\\n\r\nthe story may have an old feel with Wing but it certainly had its own touch of realism and feasibility in it. taking the old aspect of &quot;Gundams are justice&quot; and &quot;Gundams against the world&quot; Gundam 00 featured more struggle as compared to its predecessors. though the idea of one Gundam capable of taking on hordes of enemies is feasible at first (as it always have been in the Gundam series), this invincibility has been sabotaged ingeniously by the weakness of the pilots. like wing, no matter how powerful your mechas are, faced against quite a number of enemies, the chances of human error escalates, decreasing the capabilities of a God-like savior.\\n\\n\r\nit is in this respect that i really enjoyed Gundam Wing and now, Gundam 00. the paradox of powerful robots piloted by simple human beings gives this anime realism and puts limitations to one's imagination.\\n\\n\r\nalso, there are no overly-powerful mechas in Gundam 00. everyone has its drawbacks as if each were designed with balance in mind. \\n\\n\r\nExia for instance specializes in close combat capabilities but have difficulty with mid-range and long ranged fights. dynames specializes in ranged fire but have difficulty when the enemy gets too close. kyrios is maneuverable and well balanced but does not excel much in fields of long range and close range fights, it simply is maneuverable and has average capabilities. virtue has insane firepower that can take down mobs but wear out its energy is easily. to compensate for this, each unit is assigned with a partner best suit to back each other up. exia is paired with dynames for cover in long range while virtue is backed up with kyrios which easily dodges the energy cannon used by virtue.\\n\\n\r\nit is on this series that the concept of teamwork matters more rather than taking on them all alone. also, the mesiters know that it is best in warfare to finish enemies off before they increase in number as they would be having much difficulty later on. they know the rules of warfare and apply it on each of their battles.\\n\\n\r\ni also believe that the mesiter's roles and attitudes affect the &quot;humanity&quot; of their Gundams. their lack of experience, their constant complaints as to why the world is evil, their regrets and pains. i think that balances their mech's power, giving birth to a powerful being that's limits is exceeded by human will.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like to watch how one-sided losing battles are fought realistically, i recommend watching Gundam 00.",

Now i was planning on never seeing this series, but after talking with people who know a lot about mecha i decided to give it a shot, and wow was I very disappointed. The gundam pilots or as they are called in this show \"meisters\" have no depth to them at all. They have the personality of a paper plate and even after seeing their background nothing is really added to those characters. The gundam's themselves are over the topand so ridiculous at some points i couldn't help but laugh.  The one saving grace of this show are the enemies. Characters from the other 3 countries are pretty well developed, and pretty damn likable. The mecha designs are nice and realistic. For most of the show i found my self cheering for them hoping beyond hope that they would be able to beat the odds and defeat the gundam's. So overall its 3, its really just Gundam Wing with very likable bad guys.",

            "content": "I'm not going to compare Gundam 00 to any other of the Gundam series.  Gundam 00 is the only Gundam series to not take place in an alternate universe, but instead takes place in the future of our own.   \r\nThe year is 2309 AD.  With the exhaustion of fossil fuels, mankind split into three power blocs to build orbital or space elevators, brining a never ending supply of solar energy to the earth.  Despite this advancement, the three power blocs are still in a state almost equivalent to a Cold War, developing military technology to stay ahead of other powerblocs and competing in a space race.  The story takes place around the paramilitary organization Celestial Being, an organization founded over 200 years ago with its members sword to secrecy to achieve one goal: the eradication of conflict on Earth through armed interventions to unite the Earth before mankind ventures out further into space.  To achieve their goals, they utilize mobile suits called Gundams, technology generations in advance to that found on Earth.  With the beginning of their armed interventions, humanity and the three power blocs are forced to recognize and respond to Celestial Being.  Gundam 00 is an intriguing story of comraderie, corruption, betrayal, passion in the face of adversity, and a testament to humanity's desire to exist/\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Gundam 00 is unprecedented; almost the entire staff of Sunrise was utilized in its development.  Each mobile suit, whether it be a main Gundam or a minor suit of the power blocs, is exquisitely designed with outstanding detail.  It is hardly an exaggeration to say that there has never been a series in which mechas are so extravagent and breathtaking to see.  The background animation of countless different places on Earth and in space are amazing.  The artwork fully brings the universe of Gundam 00 to life in vibrant colors and designs.  The battle sequences are smooth and detailed.  Each character is given a unique look, unlike many animes in which all characters look the same spare different hairstyles and colors.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and sound effects in Gundam 00 are also outstanding, with opening themes done by major Japanese acts L'arc-en-Ciel and Brilliant Green, accompanied by excellent insert songs and endings as well.  Every movement and every attack in the battles is realistic and pulls you into the action.  The voice acting is also outstanding, producing Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor awards in the Seiyuu Awards of 2008.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fleshed out very well, especially the Gundam Meisters and Celestial Being's strategical planner, Sumeragi.  While a part of the show is to keep their backgrounds a mystery, as the details are revealed, their actions completely agree with their backgrounds, creating well-rounded and unique characters.  Even the civilian characters who give the viewers perspective of the affects of the Gundam's actions on Earth are very well rounded.  The reason holding me back from giving the characters a 10 is that there is still a second season coming (a continuation of the first) where more information will be revealed.  Right now, quite a bit of the main characters of Celestial Beings secrets are still hidden under layers, since their true identities are classified within the story.\\n\\n\r\nGundam 00 is for any type of anime viewer, from the casual to the mecha or Gundam enthusiast.  If the amazing artwork doesn't draw you in, the story and characters will or vice versa.  Even if you want to pay no heed to the story, the stunning visuals during battles are worth watching on their own.  Very rarely is there a wasted moment in the show, spare one recap episode told from a different character's perspective.  I can't possibly recommend this series more highly.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nBasically, there's a terrorist organization known as Celestial Being that carries out missions and plans to eradicate war and make the world a peaceful place, by using force and, well, violence. Their weapon that makes them so strong are the Gundams. This sounds like a maybe somewhat cliche plot that anyone can think of, like the whole fighting for peace stuff and all, but the idea really is elevated to an amazing level. So many twists, unexpected events, and trials all arise during the story that make is marvelous, which I'm not gonna go into detail about, for that would be spoiling. The story isn'treally amazing in the beginning, but it quickly becomes spectacular, and the build up to the second season is perfect.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation is pretty top-notch. Even with the intricate Gundam designs, I've never noticed any errors such as disproportional parts and such. Everything, form the beginning to the end, is done very well. The Gundam designs, as well as the character designs, were the best I've seen in the Gundam franchise. All of the fight scenes are greatly animated and well executed.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OPs and EDs are all very good and well suited for the series (I especially like Daybreak's Bell ^_^.) The sound effects are great, from the explosions to the sounds of beam sabers and beam rifles. The voice acting is also really good. All of the voices fit the characters nicely and were good choices. The background is pretty good as well, always fitting the scene quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nPeople can say they don't like how emotional and all the main cast can be at times, but in my opinion, I greatly prefer that over just 4 dudes that are just fighting for the hell of it and have absolutely no purposes for killing tons of people for their career on a daily basis. It makes the characters seem very real and deep, and gives them a lot of depth. The main cast, the 4 Gundam Meisters, are all really cool in my opinion, and all of them are very likable for their differences and certain qualities they all possess, as well as each of their individual pasts and their reasons for being Meisters.\\n\r\nHowever, what I think was good about this, was that the series also was able to focus on other side characters very well, particularly Louise and Saji, who although they don't seem to have much of an important role in this season, will probably be pretty important in season 2.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nGundam 00 is extremely enjoyable. The action and battles are magnificent, especially towards the end of the series. The drama and emotion portrayed is superb, again, especially during the sad moments towards the end of the season. The cast all have their own secrets that gradually are uncovered (to a certain extent,) and the story takes several turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. All these qualities make the enjoyment level simply outstanding, especially if you're a Gundam fan.",

Sometimes you'd just want to pause and stare in wonder :D. \r\nThe story line was veryvery intriguing, you got a bunch of people trying to END WAR with WAR, so we're talking about 4 mechas taking on the world, some serious under dogginess. You'd expect it to be one sided cuase &quot;these gundams must be super or something&quot; to take on the world and at first the gundams own just about anything... but the world quickly catches up and the battles are quite even.\\n\\n\r\nIt was entertaining in that i was curious to see what would happen and go deeper in each of the characters past and their struggle to fight off overwhelming numbers was very intense. Also the stroy line was unpredictable as the story made me feel no one could be trusted and conflicted sometimes in deciding who really was the good guy and bad guy.\\n\\n\r\nOH and the music.... great J pop, got some on my music player and banging away as i type lol\\n",

            "content": "The Gundam franchise has been a part of my life now ever since I was re-introduced to the franchise thanks to Gundam Build Fighters and Gundam Iron-Blooded Orphans. Throughout my journey from this franchise I had seen a lot of great from this franchise but at the same time a lot of bad from this franchise.\r\nNevertheless, I still had a great time watching all of the Gundam shows from this franchise and I don\u2018t regret it one bit.\r\nThe U.C Gundam shows are mostly great sure they had its weak moments like ZZ and Victory but out of all the Gundam timelines, the U.C timeline isthe most polished of them all.\\n\r\nNow the alternate universe overall are hit or mess depending on your tastes and some alternate universe Gundam shows were good others ranged from meh to pretty bad.  \\n\r\nOut of all the alternate universe, Gundam shows Gundam 00 got the most praise from the franchise even surpassing Wing and Seed.\\n\r\n So with all that said does Gundam 00 deserve that praise and does it hold when compared to the other Gundam shows before and ever since?\\n\r\nHello, everyone, this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcome to my review of Gundam 00 seasons 1 and 2 and with that out of the way let\u2019s get started.\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe year is 2307 as the result of the depletion of fossil fuels humanity now had to search for a new source of power. The power was found in the form of solar-powered Dyson rings orbiting the earth and supported by three orbital elevators. Each orbital elevator was served by one of the three power blocks of the planet which consists of the Union, The Human Reform League and AEU (Advanced European Union). Despite having this near inexhaustible source of power it really only seemed to benefit the major powers and allies and because of these minor countries of the world plunging into poverty and constantly break out into warfare just for fuel and energy.\\n\r\nThis ongoing chaos led to the actual creation of a private organization called celestial being whose main goal to end wars and end humanity. To accomplish this they created four powerful mobile suits each piloted by four people called Gundam meisters.\\n\r\nThe four misters being Setsuna F Seiei, Lockon Stratos, Allelujah Haptism and Tieria Erde. Together they carry out various missions to intervene acts of war throughout the war while the three powers try to eliminate them.\\n\r\nThe story for Gundam 00 is pretty good overall but it has problems which mainly appears on season 2.\\n\r\nOne of the mains things that I liked the series mainly season 1 is how different it was when compared to the other Gundam shows. It does away with the standard full-scale warfare that we see before from most Gundam shows from the past and instead, it tells a story that tackles some of the modern topics that the world is facing around that time such as religious and terrorism. I really adored where the first season went with this as it questions celestial beings motives. This is the stuff that I loved about Gundam. The first season made think about the issues that we have to face in everyday life. I was really invested in it.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I cannot say the same thing for season 2 because it took most of the stuff that made season 1 great and throws it away in favor of a standard faction vs faction story that we see seen before. Not only that but the writing season 2 not that good when compared to season 1 where the writing was pretty strong for the most part.  Not to mention some of the topics and themes that was introduced in season 1 got preachy in season 2. It's not Wing or Seed Destiny level of preachiness but it was still preachy nonetheless. The last thing that I want to mention is the pacing. Unlike Seed and Seed Destiny where the pacing was broken beyond repair thanks to having a lot of flashback sequences, 00 pacing was a bit too fast at times especially in season 2 where it becomes a big problem for the narrative and character development.\\n\r\nOverall the story for 00 is pretty alright for the most part. Season 1 by itself is pretty good that did a good job at tacking modern topics as well having good writing for the most part despite the small pacing issues in season 1. Season 2 however, is okay at best where it may had some great moments now and then it but was ultimately lackluster in the writing and pacing department not to mention the themes and topics got incredibly preachy in season 2.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe characters in Gundam are pretty enjoyable for the most part especially in season 1, however, feel like most of the characters in 00 don\u2019t have much character development thanks to the fast pacing of 00 and it begins to the bite the show in the ass season 2.\\n\r\nI will save the 00 boys for last but let\u2019s talk about the other characters starting with Saji and Louise.\\n\r\nI was honestly shocked at how much I liked them in season 1. At first, I thought these two were a waste of screen time however as the first season progresses I understood what the first season intended to do with them. They are normal people living normal lives that sadly get caught in a tragedy by the end of season 1 that changes them forever which was shown in season 2. Unfortunately, while I liked how Louise and Saji changed in season 2 I didn\u2019t like them as much in season 1 especially Saji who for became a Shinji Ikari clone where he spends most of the show whining and doing dumb shit for no reason. It\u2019s such as shame really because I liked Saji in season 1.\\n\r\nGraham was a pretty cool character in season 1 and I really liked his determination of how he wants to beat a Gundam in battle. Unfortunately, he devolved into a shitty Char clone in season 2 and he didn\u2019t really do anything apart trying to 1v1 with Sestuna and whine a lot.\\n\r\nAli al-Saachez is a pretty badass character in season 1 he was easily my second favorite charters in season 1. I loved how Sasschez was such a great rival/enemy to Setsuna and they conflict with the other was always a joy to watch. However unlike Graham who devolved into a mediocre character in season 2 he still remained a badass but now playing in second fiddle which is honestly sad.\\n\r\nFeldt is a character that I really liked. In the beginning, she was an anti-social girl who barely says anything unless she has to. However, as the series progresses she starts to open up the Celestial Being crew as she starts feeling more comfortable\\n\r\nNow if there was a character that was useless to the overall plot than it would be Marina who is by far one of the worst characters from the Gundam franchise. All she did in the series is preach about human understanding to Setsuna and writing a song that ultimately lead to nothing. As much I hate Relena from Gundam Wing least she redeemed herself in the movie Endless Waitz where she finally understands that she can\u2019t achieve peace by preaching about pacifism and she far less annoying in that film. Say what you want about Saji and Louise but least they're felt like characters that a purpose in the narrative instead of being a useless plot device like Marina.\\n\r\nThe villains in 00 not counting Ali al Saachez were pretty underwhelming at best as they don\u2019t have any motives other than taking over the world and humanity. You dropped that ball on that one Sunrise.\\n\r\nNow that\u2019s all the other characters done now let\u2019s talk about the 00 boys.\\n\r\nTieria was really annoying at first as he liked to be a total dick to everyone in Celestial Being and he was gladly to eliminate anyone who puts the plan in jeopardy. He eventually opens up over time and despite being the most feminist of the group I thought he was a pretty forgettable character that I didn\u2019t like.\\n\r\nThe first Lockon being Neil Dylandy is my favorite character in the series. I loved his easy-going nature as well-being the most sociable out of the 00 boys\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t like the second Lockon Lyle Dylandy at first but the series went on I started to like him a bit thanks to him being a very skilled pilot as being kinda likable in the second half of season 2 however at times I feel he can be a total asspuller like Suzaku in Geass R2.\\n\r\nAllelujah is a pretty interesting character as he has a split personality that appears every time he goes into battle. However, I feel the writers never really went anyway with it and it became almost irrelevant when you get to season 2 where he starts forming a love interest to Marie due to them being both experimental super soldiers of HRL in the past\\n\r\nFinally, we have Setsuna who is one of the better Gundam protagonists from the franchise. Setsuna was once a child who slayed his parents to prove his loyalty to God but ultimately became disillusioned and grew to hate conflicts overall which lead him to join celestial being. In a nutshell, Setsuna is Heero Yuuji done right because not only much better-written character who compare to Heero who was a bland, contrived and stoic idiot from start to finish but Setsuna actually has character development. Throughout the series we see Setsuna trying to fix his own mistakes during his child soldier days. Also, Setsuna has an actual personality. Sure he starts off being as a stoic person after being traumatized during his child soldier days but as the series goes on he starts to express his feeling to people without reservation not to mention he starts to become more human instead of a stoic soldier.\\n\r\nOverall the characters in 00 were pretty enjoyable for what they were despite they shortcoming but having mostly underdeveloped characters thanks to the show fast pacing as well as many characters getting downgraded in season 2.  Besides that, I thought the characters were enjoyable\\n\r\n6.5/10\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nVisually Gundam 00 is a massive step up when compared to the cosmic era of Gundam being Gundam Seed and Gundam Seed Destiny. The background scenery is amazing to look at that is filled with color that blends well with the tone of the series. The character designs were done by Risa Amada who goes by the pen name Yun K\u014dga and while haven\u2019t check out her works but she has her own manga series called Loveless. Compared to Hisashi Hirai where most of the characters designs are the same from the Seed series Yun Koga did a good job at with the characters designs however I feel like some of the male characters look more feminine.\\n\r\nAs for the actual animation is honestly amazing. The fight choreography was great for the mechs, character movement is fluent and there was no stock footage used. Thank god because after watching Wing and Seed I got sick of seeing recycled footage all the damm time.\\n\r\nIf I had any complaints with the animation then it would be the overkill formula. Okay the overkill formula in 00 is not as bad when compared to Seed and Wing but it was still kind of an issue for me especially in season 2\\n\r\nThe mecha designs in 00 are pretty good overall and they were pretty original for the most part and like the mechs in Wing and Seed they all have their own gimmicks and strength but I feel they did a far better job at showcasing the mechs in 00 compare to Wing and Seed.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for 00 is fantastic and it\u2019s the war tone for the series very well. Easily one of the best soundtracks from the franchise.\\n\r\nThe season 1 openings and endings themes are pretty great overall and they are very memorable especially the second opening theme Ash Like Snow which is my all-time favorite Gundam opening theme as well-being my fourth favorite anime opening period.\\n\r\nThe season 2 openings and endings themes are not as great and memorable as the season 1 but they were pretty enjoyable for what they were.\\n\r\nNow for sub vs dub.\\n\r\nI only seen bits of the sub for 00 but I remember the sub being pretty good.\\n\r\nThe dub for 00 is pretty as it featured a lot of well-known voice actors from the other Gundam shows in the past.\\n\r\nBrad Swaile who previously voiced Amuro from Gundam 0079, Quatre from Gundam Wing and Dearka from Gundam Seed returned to voice the protagonist Setsuna and he honestly did a great job voicing Setsuna.\\n\r\nChanta Strandwho previously voiced Lacus and Meer from Gundam Seed + Destiny returned to voice Feldt and she once again did a solid job voicing Feldt.\\n\r\nScott McNeil who previously voiced Duo from Gundam Wing returns to voice Ali Al-Saachez who has the best performance in Gundam 00. He was fantastic as voicing Ali Al-Saachez.\\n\r\nIn short both languages are great.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nAfter watching Gundam 00 as well buying the out of print DVDs from Beez Entertainment UK at my local Cex store how good was it. Well, I think it\u2019s a good Gundam series for the most part. Do I think it\u2019s the best Gundam series ever made? Obviously not. I don\u2019t think it holds up as well as other Gundam shows like G, X, Build Fighters Season 1 and Turn A but it feels it\u2019s better than the likes of Wing, Build Fighters Try, Seed + Destiny and Victory. I feel like Sunrise did a good job with the series as it fixed a lot of problems that had with Wing and Seed. The first season alone is a great Gundam show that had a lot of interesting in it as well having fun and likable character. Not to mention the writing for the first season was pretty solid. It has some problems though. The pacing at was way too fast times especially in season 2 the characters aren\u2019t the most developed bunch I seen in a Gundam show and season 2 as a whole is inferior in the writing department where it resorted of using a mediocre plot that we all seen before from Gundam shows from the past. Not to mention many of the characters got downgraded in season 2 and because of those reason along 00 season 2 is okay at best but when compared to season 1 is pretty disappointing. Despite its shortcomings mainly in season 2 I still recommended Gundam 00 for people who want to start watching Gundam but doesn\u2019t want to start too far back to the U.C Gundam shows.\\n\r\nSeason 1 score 8.5/10\\n\r\nSeason 2 score 6.5/10\\n\r\nOverall Score 7.5/10\\n",

            "content": "Gundam 00 was the first Gundam series I've actually finished, and I actually found it very entertaining. Hearing about the failure of its predecessor, Gundam Seed Destiny, I initially approached this series with some apprehension, but that was all forgotten at the first episode.\r\nStory: The plot of the story is...unusual. Basically, 299 years from now, there is a private military group main objective is for the eradication of armed conflict through their Gundams. Basically, to destroy war, they will fight it (Quite ironic) The story of Gundam 00 is filled with politics, and on average, an episode will consist of more than half the episodecontaining political matters. Despite it sounding tedious, the political significance in Gundam 00 is what makes it stand out, and it shows us the World of Gundam 00 through a different perspective. Another thing unusual about Gundam 00 is that there is no clear &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; side. The show is viewed through 3, main different perspectives; The civilian's, the main factions, and Celestial Beings, and whilst Celestial Being's goal sounds like a good idea, the views from another perspective show it differently, such as their interference with global conflict caused terrorist groups to attack innocent civilians. This element alone makes Gundam 00 very interesting to watch, and it doesn't follow the cliche that the main characters are the &quot;good&quot; guys, and their goal is marred by the &quot;bad guys&quot;, but rather, it shows the good and bad of all perspectives.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I will say, the art in Gundam 00 is very good, and it is particularly outstanding when showing mobile suits. This is nothing like Gundam Seed/Destiny, absolutely no stock footage reused. The battle animations are all of extreme high quality, and they are amazing to watch. Unfortunately, battle sequences tend to be quite short, tending to last less than 3 minutes. The mech designs also look very well designed, whether they be the Gundams, the Overflags, the GN-Xs, etc... The people themselves also look very nice, and the females of their series look particularly beautiful with their &quot;00&quot; figures (Great breasts).\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound quality is on the same level of Gundam Seed/Destiny, but it sounds completely different. Whilst GS/D have excellent pop music accompanying the series, the music in Gundam 00 shines particularly during battle sequences. The battle music is plentiful, and there is a lot of variety to match the many moods of the fights throughtout the series. The OP and EDs are, surprising, all great tracks, particularly the two OPs. The VAs also did very well, although it was a bit odd seeing Rie Kugimiya voice Nena Trinity (Who had a very well developed figure, in contrast to the loli figured characters Rie Kugimiya is famous for voicing).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is where Gundam 00 falls a little short. The main characters did not really recieve any character development until halfway through the series, and were generally quite bland. Tieria in particular was quite an unappealing character, because he felt the current Gundam Meisters were not fit for their roles, until later on, when he started to warm up and the Meisters truly worked as a team. Saji and Louise are shown frequently in Gundam 00, and were quite annoying until the death of Louise's family caused by Celestial Being near the middle of the anime. There is a lot of character history as well, and it is often shown how it has affected them and why certain characters act in a certain way.  Overall, character development really accelerated for the main cast shortly after the Trinities appeared.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Gundam 00 was a very enjoyable show to watch every week, because the show content was interesting, the fights were beautiful, the political dialogue was intriguing, and because it was different from all the other shows. I definitely like how the battles were evenly matched when the Gundams were outnumbered, when their opposition as superior stratagetic thinking, and when the factions obtained same-level mobile suits, to show us the flaws of Celestial Being and the fact that they are not all powerful.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I consider this a very realistic (Compared to all the animes out there) anime, and it's quite pleasing to see that they managed to merge real-life issues (Post 9/11 mood) and present this show in a &quot;grey&quot; view, as opposed to the usual black and white. I recommend this show for anyone who truly appreciates quality over quantity (battles), an interesting story and mechs. This is only the first half, and the highly anticipated second half airs this fall.\\n",

            "content": "Quick Note: This review will occasionally mention references to other entries in the Gundam franchise for comparison's sake as well as quality of execution compared to other entries, while also making this review as friendly as possible to people who have no experience with the franchise. Please note that this review ONLY includes the first season.\r\nI am also more than willing to answer any questions if any part of this review is not instantly understood by the readers. Anyway, onto the review.\r\nThe Gundam meta-series is a colossal franchise in Japan, not unlike the Star Wars or Star Trek franchises in the West. The franchise spawnsanime series, OVAs, movies, novels, manga adaptations and had received previously unrivaled popularity in Japan thanks to its compelling story-lines, simplistic but well-thought out dialogue, like-able and most importantly well-developed characters. The franchise hasn't, unfortunately, been as successful with the Western audience and thrown aside due to unpopular stereotypes people who dislike certain entries in the franchise keep ranting about, ranging from how the characters never die apparently, to how the mechs have plot armor when the pilots are inside them, to how naive and idealistic the main characters are to how forced the element of understanding is. While these stereotypes do apply to certain entries, they do not apply to all of them and are overly exaggerated by the inexperienced viewers of the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nHow well does the first season of Gundam 00 do then? Is it a return to the glory days of the Universal Century timeline (for those who don't know, the first Gundam timeline) or is it yet another pointless cash grab after the atrocity that was SEED Destiny and just another stain in the franchise's name?\\n\\n\r\nTo begin with, Gundam 00 has a very unique and interesting, if a bit idealistic at first, premise. An organization led by a man who died over 200 years ago has come with four overpowered machines to bring peace to the world and fight, as the series puts it, a \"war to end all wars\" and obliterate conflict.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the obvious reference to World War I, the first season is extremely morally gray and it becomes clear quickly that there are good people fighting on almost all sides. The show is obviously centered around the four Gundam pilots, but it is a genuinely pleasant surprise to see that the series focuses on letting us know how people from around the world feel about this conflict. All sorts of opinions about how people perceive the coming of the Gundam pilots and the advantages and disadvantages that such an organization brings with it helps make the viewer feel that they are part of the world these characters are living in. The other parties involved in this conflict and the soldiers who fight for them against the threat that was Celestial Being are also ambiguous, which helps us understand and sympathize with these characters rather than merely see them as one note villains (if they are villains at all in the eyes of the viewer).\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect that is extremely well-done in 00 aside from how well the setting and viewpoints are fleshed out are the extreme resemblance certain events in the show have with actual political events (9/11 in particular, not unlike Gundam SEED), and this is made especially obvious with the Middle Eastern crisis where the power blocs in the show decide to toy around with that region of the world, to the point where the region is so divided that the power blocs continue exploiting it through both direct and indirect means. The aspect that deserves special praise is how it portrays religious extremism in an effective manner without making all people who believe in religion retards, but instead showing that there are good people (I'm emphasizing this a lot, I know) on every side fighting for what they believe in.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is not perfect however, and Celestial Being have too much plot armor at the most convenient moments. The battles are still intense for most of the show and they are paced well enough within the main story without detracting from the value of the battles or the plot, but the flaw still stands and the season goes on for too long without answering important plot related questions where I felt it could have answered everything and ended here. Nevertheless, the show still gets a high score because at the end of the day, a flawed plot with well-explored themes sounds much better than a plot with no loopholes but hardly any substance or value.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Sunrise have thankfully improved greatly in this aspect from their dismal performance in Gundam SEED Destiny. The animation is amazingly fluid with very few repeated frames during the battles and series in general, and special mention goes to the opening scene for looking absolutely gorgeous. The coloring fits the mood of the show while at the same time looking colorful and vibrant rather than dull and lifeless, which is an enhanced advantage that carries over from Gundam SEED (which, with all its flaws was still a very colorful show). The same cannot be said for the artwork, which while well above-average feels out of place for a show like this. Every girl has massive breasts (because lord forbid that women don't have giant breasts) and every man in the show looks... well, questionable? Tieria gets special mention here, considering I haven't seen a single person who I've introduced this show to mention him as a guy. As well as having purple hair. But anyway, the artwork is a far cry from bad, and the characters have very distinct facial expressions and features, which is better than them having the same face with different eye colors and hair colors like most anime series, so this show still looks great despite the fact that I personally feel that a more seinen like art-style would work better with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn't particularly memorable (save for perhaps the battle music) though it does fit the mood of the show and I do not think that I can remember any moments where the sound effects felt wrongly placed or the wrong piece of music played at the wrong time.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was well-done and all the voices fit the characters (special mention here goes to Setsuna's Mamoru Miyano and Smirnov's Unsho Ishizuka). The opening and ending songs are AMAZING, special mention goes to the second opening, Ash Like Snow and second ending, Friends. The English voice acting is decent and lacks the questionable Engrish of the sub, but I found the subbed version easier to emotionally invest in. The dub is still passable if you only watch dubs, but I personally recommend the subs more. The dub deserves a special mention for the AMAZING performance of Setsuna's Brad Swaile, who perfectly captures Setsuna's cold, distant yet tragic character.\\n\\n\r\nGundam 00 has a variety of interesting characters, which are all interesting in their own right.The Gundam pilots are the stars of this show and their interactions with each other and other characters as well as their backgrounds are the most interesting part of the show. There's the soldiers fighting on the other sides as well, most notable of which are Graham Aker who is Setsuna's main rival as well as Smirnov and Marie, who provide a more mature perspective to the show. The other characters are unfortunately not as interesting and tend to be used as plot points to drive the themes of the show forward, which while leads to some interesting character development for some of them (Saji and Louise deserve mention here) still feels forced and not as compelling as it should have.\\n\\n\r\nThe best character of this show is undeniably Setsuna, who a lot of people would consider a mash up of Sousuke from Full Metal Panic and Heero from Gundam Wing. I consider these comparisons superficial at best, since Setsuna feels more compelling due to his past and beliefs than either of them (though Sousuke is funnier and Heero has nostalgia behind him). Speaking about any character in this show would contain spoilers, unfortunately, so I'll merely state that all four Gundam pilots are compelling due to his past and beliefs than either of them (though Sousuke is funnier and Heero has nostalgia behind him). Speaking about any character in this show would contain spoilers, unfortunately, so I'll merely state that all four Gundam pilots are compelling characters which stand on their own from their respective archetypes despite having unnerving similarities to the characters from Wing (Setsuna being similar to Heero, Lockon to Duo, Allelujah to Trowa and Tieria to Wufei).\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs a Middle Easterner, this show was a breath of fresh air in the sea of a lot of shows that attempt to be morally gray about religious conflicts but failed. The series is extremely entertaining and offers something for the viewer that wants something intelligent as well. There are flaws, but they are not enough for me to say that they stood in the way of me enjoying this show; I highly recommend this show and wholeheartedly recommend the franchise as a whole, as there is very little to regret and a lot to love.\\n\\n\r\nThank you very much for reading this review!",

            "content": "Gundam Wing, Gundam G, Gundam Seed, Gundam Seed Destiny etc... There are so many gundam series out there so why bother watching another gundam saga?\r\nStory:\r\nSet in the year 2307 AD, Gundam 00 focuses on Celestial beings and their aim to eradicate war through force with the use of mobile suits known as Gundams.\r\nWell, almost all people have a view of what the gundam story is like: aiming for peace and there\u2019s mech to mech battle. This one has somewhat the same scene, but the only difference is that gundams in here are contradictory to what people think gundams should be. In here, the protagonists (gundams)are the ones using force to fight those that pose a threat to peace even though there's \"no action of war yet\" therefore creating chaos. So this is a twist to the usual gundam story, wherein people\u2019s impression is that gundams bring peace and are the saviors.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the missions of the Gundam Meisters to eradicate war, there is also a light subplot involving Louise and Saji. They stand on the civilian side\u2019s point of view, and I guess, this is the light part of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe story doesn\u2019t present a one-sided view point, but presents to us a multi-view point story line. It not only presents the view point of the main character \u2013 Celestial Beings, but also the view point of the opposing force \u2013 AEU, UNION and HRL and even the civilian\u2019s view point \u2013 Saji and Loiuse.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 10\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\r\nThe characters are well done. Main characters are pretty boys and girls. Antagonists aren\u2019t drawn one sided. There\u2019s Ali Al Sachees\u2019 appearance that gives a creepy war freak feeling and Graham\u2019s appearance gives of a feel of ace pilot.\\n\\n\r\nThe mecha designs are very unique. The mechas in here have simplistic and futuristic design and is innovative \u2013 not using energy wings or boosters.\\n\\n\r\nThe series boasts of awesome high definition visuals. The animation is very fluid and very detailed. From the movement of the gundams down to the emission of the GN particles everything is exquisitely done.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are very interesting. The main characters each have a different vibe. There\u2019s Setsuna F Seiei who is silent but not emotionless, Allelujah who has a split personality, Lokon who is easygoing, Tiera who is very mysterious and strict but caring.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also Marina Ismail, a very na\u00efve princess that gives off a motherly image. She saw the world in a different view point because of Setsuna and I think she's similar to WINGS's Releena. Although the only difference is that Releena has more power and has a firm resolve than Marina.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast overall is excellent.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe fast paced plot, action and mecha fights will keep you glued to your seats. The mystery behind each main character will keep you asking for more. Fans may compare it to WING but it still has its own charm and originality.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI say its story line is unpredictable especially the last episode. All in all,  Gundam 00 has again marked its own place in the realm of mecha animes. I say this is the way mecha anime should be.",

            "content": "As a first-time Gundam watcher, i must say this show really is something.\r\nStory: - 9.3/10 (A)\r\nThe story is about Gundam Meisters who work for Celestial Being (catchy name lol), a group who's main goal is to permanetly stop wars while fighting. Stopping war with more war? Well, it's odd but somehow interesting. We have Setsuna F. Seiei, the newest Meister and well, a cheery fellow. (His name means pain, ain't that perfect for him?) Next we have Hallelujah (Hallelujah!!! lol i had to do that), a Meister with an odd past. He has another side to him called Allelujah (Take out the H), a moreevil and sinister person. Interesting.. . Next we have Tieria Erde, a really depressing guy (guy right?) who follows the rules to where we want to call him a geek.  And then we have Lockon, a really funny guy with a cool little sidekick with wise cracks. So in other words we have: Two depressing people, one cheery, and one who's half and half. Now that's a bringer.Then we have Saji and Louise, the characters that show a regular person's view of the whole Celestial Being deal. Really interesting there, i like that concept. I'm a sucker for political/mecha/shounen anime, so this really won't disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: - 9.5/10 (A)\\n\r\nIt seems every scene of Gundam is beautifully animated. The fights do not disappoint. Sometimes it can be way too animated to where it looks ridiculous and sometimes it's really well animated on a scene where it doesn't have to.\\n\\n\r\nSound: - 7.9/10 (C+)\\n\r\nThe music isn't so memorable, however. The pieces are amazing, but you forget them the next episode. The first OP, &quot;Daybreak's Bell&quot; is a instant favorite. I don't listen to the ED's, however i can just as speculate they are good as well. Next is &quot;Ash Like Snow&quot;, a good &quot;before an ultra mega fight&quot; song, but after listening to it 100 times on my iPod i suddenly got tired of hearing it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: - 9/10 (A-)\\n\r\nWell, like many popular animes, Gundam is no stranger to the hype that is known as &quot;Having many characters makes you look awesome&quot;. But unlike most shows, Gundam manages to give each character a reasonably good amount of airtime. From the Union to the A.E.U to the Human Reform League, we got a ton of characters. Sure i can't name them all, but i can remember their faces pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: - 9.1/10 (A) / Overall (Averaged): 8.96/10 (B+)\\n\r\nGundam 00 is definetly a show worth watching. I know, i know: &quot;I've had it with mecha anime!&quot;. We've all seen Macross, Geass, and Gurren Lagann but they all fail in comparison to Gundam (mainly because Gundam has been around since 1979). I'm definetly buying the DVD's, even donating to Sunrise for their hard work on this great show.",

            "content": "I basically feel that this anime has enough reviews so I give a different one: The review your are about to see is mostly about the comparison of Anno Domini to the Cosmic Era. Why? It is the successor of the mega-hit Gundam Seed and GS Destiny. Fangirls/ boys may still demand cute lovey-dovey characters or enthusiasts might want a deeper and more unique plot. So I hope that this review may help people  who watched GSD that included Gundam 00 in their \"to watch\" list and those who evaluating it.\r\nSTORY:\r\nCosmic Era\\n\r\nDrama:     more intense and plentiful                  \\n\r\nAction:      repetitive but good,relies on Gundam's power                 \\n\r\nRomance: plenty &amp; unexpected                         \\n\\n\\n\r\n Anno Domini:\\n\r\nDrama:more natural and untypical\\n\r\nAction: very excellent and intelligent with strategy and teamwork\\n\r\nRomance:close to none\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen the Cosmic Era heavily focuses on the internal drama of the main characters AD portrays a different kind of heroism. When they both condemn war yet clarifies that fighting is necessary to live, CE roots this to human emotion and desire. Two sides fighting for noble or distorted reasons alike are both victims in a tragic war. Meanwhile, AD tackles this issue in a more realistic way by directly relating it to our current world- oil crisis, terrorism, economic turmoils. Furthurmore, those are challenged by a small group of people -the Celestial Beings- with four powerful mobile suits. \\n\\n\r\nGundams vs the world? Sounds ridiculous? It works. But it is amazing that the story is woven pretty well for that idea to be utterly plausible and workable. In addition to this, even with the limited character interaction due to huge distances, each's action affect the overall picture- in a way, everyone is related to one another.  Moreover, while the presence of &quot;evil&quot; leaders are prevalent in Gundam series, AD is a bit different: it shows that humanity as a whole conflicts within itself.\\n\\n\r\nAD is pretty original, but compare to CE, its execution is a bit slower. Though containing a number of unnecessary flashbacks, CE seems to be a bit faster than AD even with 50 episodes .Also, for many times, AD put together subplots with thin links with each other; lastly, its worst trait is that it has no climax or weak climax.\\n\\n\r\nWinner: None\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\\n\r\nCosmic Era                                       \\n\r\nConsistency: A bit bad                                    \\n\r\nArt style:       Familiar but eye candy cute                    \\n\r\nQuality:        High quality traditional                           \\n\r\nMechs:         So many cool designs      \\n\\n\r\nAnno Domini\\n\r\nConsistency:Superb!\\n\r\nArt style: Serious tone\\n\r\nQuality: HIGH DEFINITION\\n\r\nMechs:    More detailed, vivid, innovative and memorable\\n\\n\r\nAD is obviously superior in the category of quality and &quot;hi-tech&quot; factor but the character designs' appeal to the fanbase (especially the fangirls) is a bit inferior due to its less cuter style.\\n\\n\r\nWinner: AD\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\n Cosmic Era:              \\n\r\nDramatic techno-pop with traditional space mood music mixed with dramatic    and romantic ballads     \\n\\n\r\nAnno Domini:\\n\r\nAlternative rock, pop and rock    ballads coupled with &quot;epic&quot; sounds and contemporary sounds tracks\\n\\n\r\nAD lost to this one, CE's music is very successful in bringing out emotions, mixing drama, romance, action and suspense.The openings and endings are a bit radical by defying the Gundam tradition of techno, and it was satisfying. However, AD is a bit disappointing: the tracks are not memorable and some are repetitive, they are a bit typical since one can hear them on most shonen shows.\\n\\n\r\nWinner: CE\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\\n\r\n                   Cosmic Era                                        \\n\r\nCast:  Typical teenagers and            \\n\r\n                  some adults   \\n\r\nDialogues: Excellent and thought            \\n\r\n                  provoking                                        \\n\\n\r\nAnno Domini:\\n\r\nCast:  Mix of different lives\\n\r\nDialogues: Natural, lacks intensity due to indirect confrontations and and the lack of clarity on why certain characters are taking screen time.\\n\\n\r\nCE is much more focused on duty, death, love, hate and understanding- the aspects of humanity. The conflict is seen in the feelings and choices of individual people developing as they interact with others. Heart wrenching indeed, but one can also say that they designed their characters based on basic stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where AD takes its radicalism; the characters are already very much developed and the focus is in the overall conflict involving their lives, both past and present. Different people, same effects. Same actions, different effects. It's theme is living in a supposedly sick world. Beautifully, the symbolism of necessary sacrifice and undeserved pain is reflected. Sadly, the dialogue fails to amplify these elements. Though sadly, though the concept is pretty, many characters are generic.\\n\\n\r\nWinner: CE\\n\r\nENJOYMENT AND OVERALL:\\n\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed CE more than AD because of my preference, but it doesn't mean that it is better. Still, both of them are shows that deserves praise. \\n\\n\r\nCE offers more intensity and impact, however it has flaws like unnecessary fanservice, inconsistencies, bad flasbacks and irrational coincidences.\\n\\n\r\nAD has better character as a whole, free of &quot;impurities&quot; of fanservice and &quot;advertising&quot; of profitable models. It may be close to zero in flaws but it definitely &quot;lacks.&quot;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Well, it's truely been a while since I wrote a Gundam review. Yes, I've basically written a review for nearly every Gundam series for those who don't keep tabs on my Reviews. But lets get to the point shall we? \r\nOver the past few years the Gundam series has gone through a lot of riticule by many American's and has totally lost its market here making nearly impossible to even know of the franchise. Bandai's last attempt to make Gundam popular among American viewers was Gundam Seed which epically failed, and was placed in the 4 am death spot on Cartoon Network. Even though GundamSeed Destiny, sequel to Gundam Seed, won best anime of the year 2004 in Japan the series didn't do so good because it was basically Fan service and &quot;Many&quot; Gundam Fans were disappointed by the fact that there were more Hentai then Side Stories of the series. In other words BANDAI milked the crap out of Seed for all its worth. \\n\\n\r\nFew years later a new Gundam series was made to replace Gundam Seed, this series was, of course, Gundam 00. Yes, this series was intentionally delayed in order to make a new Model Market. But all in all the series wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I've watched many Gundam Series and have seen the progress they've made through the years. Gundam 00 is basically a hybrid of many old concepts mixed with thoughts of many modern day techno realism. Yes, I just made up a new term- Techno Realism. The term means technology that will possibly be invented. \\n\\n\r\n25 episodes is quite surpising for most Gundam series. The shortest Gundam series was Gundam 0080 War in the Pocket which had 6 episodes. Gundam 00 wasn't the shortest series but it was able to sum everything quickly and yet very understandable. Usually something like this would take the average 50 episodes and then a sequel would have to be made to finish the project, but no, they actually did good.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of the story are of course young adults who have their struggles and for the most part look like Bishi boys. They aren't really aren't Emo or uncontrolable as many other Gundam characters and have much more of a sense of responsiblity. Their backgrounds are interesting stories within themselves, making you more connected to them. Unfortunatly there is a downside to this, characters that get to involved with their past tend to stray off from their first impression. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is very well thought up and looks like it took much time to think up. How the world looks like in this Gundamverse makes you question if our future would be like that as well. Many politics are involved which many modern Gundam shows were lacking. \\n\\n\r\nMecha designs were simply superb. They aren't as wymsical as the suits in Gundam Seed or as in Gundam Wing but this sense of common technology is what brings me in. I kinda have a taste for generic looking Mobile suits, the ones with rough detail. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end of it all Gundam 00 didn't disappoint me, but it didn't make me overjoyed either. Sure the show is good, but you can't help but feel that eventually things will go wrong and fan service will ruin it all. So far in my opinion Gundam 00 is way better then Gundam Seed/Destiny, and Gundam Wing. But it hasn't reached the greatness of Tomino's original works such as Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta, Char's Counter Attack, and Turn A. All there is to do now is wait until the second season comes out, won't we. Until then I leave the first season with this review.",

            "content": "Well, it\u2019s a new Gundam series, and as a lot of you know, I am a hardcore Gundam fan. Was I excited for this? To be honest, after the bad taste SEED Destiny left in my mouth, I really had little to no expectations of this series. Even with Mizushima Seiji who directed the first FMA series directing this series. There have been more than 20 Gundam series now and what else can the franchise offer with a new series? I know it\u2019s drastically demanding asking for originality, but I did come to terms with that as I got more into this series. Though itmay not offer my unrealistic dreams of originality, I still feel it does have its own unique distinction in its own ways. \\n\\n\r\nTo start off, I was very surprised that this series makes direct reference to current events that are even still going on during its broadcast and during the time of this review, such as the conflicts in Sri Lanka and Ireland. Usually, they use the fictional factions in other series to be a metaphor for other real life conflicts but this takes the cake. Take for example, the first Gundam series was a metaphor for World War II, and SEED and SEED Destiny were a metaphor of a post 9/11 world though those series\u2019 don\u2019t directly reference those events like 00 does. \\n\\n\r\nWhat also captivates me are the sub-plots that involve Princess Marina, and two civilians named Saji and Louise. Princess Marina shows the difficulties of a nation like hers in today\u2019s political climate, and I like how Saji and Louise give a civilian point of view of the war. At first, I really didn\u2019t care for them, but even though they weren\u2019t directly part of the main plot, the series still effectively develops them in a manner in which it drives you to care for them and relate to them.  But besides, this interesting external supporting cast, the main cast is all pretty much characters that have been done before in other Gundam series, but their individual backgrounds are unique and that was enough for me to find interest in them. Initially in these kinds of series, the individual personalities will conflict with one another, and is the series progresses they come to unite. The formula pretty much follows the standard of a Gundam series, but some of its elements are pretty interesting.  \\n\\n\r\nMy main gripe with the series in which people are going to equally agree and disagree with me on is that it\u2019s a 25 episode series. And to be honest, I\u2019m not fond of anime TV series that is 25 episodes or less. The fact that it\u2019s 25 episodes really rushes the last third of the series, especially the ending, and things just come out of nowhere with little to no set up. And I feel with the series having the organization fight 3 super powers at once, it just doesn\u2019t work in my opinion. I know this was made with the intention of a follow up, but I still feel that it\u2019s no excuse to not develop and establish certain things here and there. Yes, there is a second season, but if you seen this series, you get some idea of what I\u2019m talking about. Even with that intent, that\u2019s no excuse to rush and force things when I think there was time to establish and develop those elements. Could that have been done better with 15-25 more episodes? Well, with other Gundam series without counting SEED Destiny, a 35-50 episode season could have really helped this series a lot with what needed to be established and developed with what was exclusive in this series, other wise, you could potentially end up with a cluster fuck like SEED Destiny. But with Mizushima, I think it would have been a series I could have scored a 10/10 for story and characters, but instead, I\u2019m giving it in the 8 range. \\n\\n\r\nWell, the design and the gimmicks for the Gundams presented have already been done before, but there will be some goodies and surprises that will probably satisfy you. If you liked Gundam Wing and/or X, then I feel stylistically, you\u2019re really going to enjoy it. Even though what is artistically presented has been seen for the most part, the coloring, rendering, and the angles are still something fresh. But I feel what makes up for this is the presentation of the action. Thankfully, the animation isn\u2019t abusively recycled like in the cosmic era Gundam series which is a start. But what makes the animation so awesome, I just felt the angles and the smooth frame rate makes the action very intense, very easy to follow and watch which makes it so exciting, simple as that. \\n\\n\r\nThe action from the Gundams can get over kill in which Gundam Wing paved way for, but eventually the action will develop that it will be more about piloting skills and strategy, as opposed to abusing the God like features. The enemy mech designs are pretty primitive looking, but have a different kind of realism to it not offered in other Gundam series. The advanced nations have agile looking mobile suits, and the poorer nations have mobile suits that are portrayed to feel like the Kitty Hawk in comparison. So I thought that was an interesting touch to show that gap in technology. \\n\\n\r\nThe character design is at least more diverse, but the men still look like women. If it weren\u2019t for the voices, I swear they would be women, especially Tieria who looks like Sailor Saturn with glasses. But being the first Gundam to be in HD, it truly delivers. The CG is awesome, and if you\u2019re looking for action, I feel you\u2019ve come to the right anime series. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I found surprising is that once again Miyano Mamoru and Brad Swale once again voice the same character. Previously they voiced Light Yagami in DeathNote, but this time, they both get to voice Setsuna, the main character of this series. And I\u2019ll admit, I was more impressed with Brad Swale\u2019s acting in comparison to Miyano Mamoru\u2019s. Usually you hear Brad Swale with that distinctive high pitched voice, but hearing him with that lower pitch voice that is reminiscent of Mark Hildreth\u2019s portrayal of Heero Yuy just took me by surprise by the balls. I felt this role gave Swale the opportunity to show how versatile he truly is. The rest of the voice cast in both English and Japanese is top notch and I really can\u2019t complain. I\u2019m not going to go into further detail due to time restraints but I do feel I need to point this out. In the English version, I felt I heard Scott McNeil\u2019s voice like 8 times per episode with a random character, and in the Japanese version I felt I heard Ishizuka Unshou\u2019s. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s me, but I felt I heard those voices a lot. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is top notch and I have nothing but praise for it. Who could go wrong with L\u2019arc~en~ciel doing the opening theme? That\u2019s pretty epic. But asides from the fact that it\u2019s l\u2019arc, I felt the tone and the lyrics of the song truly reflected the dark but yet hopeful atmosphere of the series. As for the second opening theme, Ash Like Snow, how many of you know that the singer, Tomoko Kawase, also sang Lonley is Gorgeous the theme to Paradise Kiss? Interesting distinct styles there, huh? The general background music in itself just all fits together and reflects the mood and environment.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I felt that this is a good series, but could have been better if it weren\u2019t for its limitations of being a 25 episode series. I feel with a Gundam TV series, even with an intended sequel, 25 episodes just doesn\u2019t work, and the ending to this series is proof of that. Other than that, I recommend this to just about any fan whether noob or veteran to Gundam if interested. If you want to get into Gundam and would like this to be your introduction to the franchise, give it a shot at your own pleasure. I feel with the animation techniques offered, you\u2019re going to enjoy the action and the music will keep you pumping.  \\n",

            "content": "Note: This review is for the first 25 episodes ONLY (season 1).\r\nGundam 00 one of the many non-Universal Century story series in the Gundam franchise and one that stands out primarily for its initial plot, that being an almost exact copy of the 90s series Gundam Wing: a team of young men are sent to earth in super overpowered mech suits called Gundams with the sole task of bringing peace to the world by whatever means needed. What separates 00 from the campy, cheesy melodrama of Wing though is 00 takes this premise both realistically and seriously and even tries to spin the concept onits head, calling into question the morality of the actions of the main characters and their hypocritically violent approach to stopping violence.\\n\\n\r\nThe key word, however, is \"tries\". It does not entirely succeed in the end, for a number of reasons.\\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost are the main characters themselves: the \"Gundam Meisters\", as they are called. While certainly more in depth than Wing's pretty boy heroes, the Meisters are still unfortunately very static characters with predictable, stock personalities for most of the season, and fairly unlikable ones at that. You can tell that the story has SOMETHING in plan for them to deveolop them, humanize them, and make them realize the mistakes of their ways... but it takes entirely too long to get there, and when you do it feels less like natural development and more like a personality shift.\\n\\n\r\nConflating this issue is honestly ALL the other characters from the various Earth factions are just FAR more interesting, be it the American pilot aces looking to avenge their fallen allies, the Russian military commander who constantly devises new plans to stop the Gundams and basically always succeeding until a plot convenience undoes it, the comic relief fake ace European Union who somehow always manages to survive death by sheer luck, or the Middle Eastern mercenaries who just need an excuse of a war to keep fighting. These characters suffer, struggle, and overall are generally just LIKABLE and thus more interesting to follow, but are doomed to play second fiddle to the pretty boys in super robots.\\n\\n\r\nBesides all this, in the final third of the season, the show introduces three more Gundam pilots with even MORE powerful machines and genuinely unhinged, intolerable personalities. They exist only to commit atrocities that shock even the most jaded of the Meisters, but the issue here is they only serve to be a scapegoat for them: rather than have the Meisters realize their OWN actions are causing more harm than good, they simply have to only observe their darker others do it for them. Its lazy and uninspired, and the fact these three extra Gundam pilots are intolerable hateful characters that are just not fun or interesting to watch they ultimately get killed off without much fanfare and are trivial in the overall scheme of things. This all ultimately leads up to a big unified attack against the Gundams by all the Earth nations at once using their own diet-Gundam machines and a lot of minor characters die, but only the ones on the Meister's side are given much emotional weight despite them being the least interesting of the sides. It just ends on a wet fart.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the plot itself, its... ok. Gundam 00 is heavily dedicated to its setting and world building, an Earth 200 years into the future where solar energy delivered from orbital elevators resolves the energy crisis... but also causes civil wars in formerly wealthy oil rich countries. The exposition scenes are HEAVY here and there are a LOT of names of places and characters to keep up with, and some of the political machinations can come off as overblown and up its own ass, but I enjoyed it for the most part. What is truly good about Gundam 00's narrative is how it plays with its tropes, particularly the struggle of helpless earth weapons against the Gundams. The more the Meisters attack the nations to stop their warring, the more the nations develop better technology for defeating the gundams, including reverse engineering their beam weapons and eventually making Gundam-esque mechs of their own. Seeing actions having these big world consequences is a strong point in Gundam 00's favor, and is a rare sight in most any mecha series.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, to end on a positive note, Gundam 00 has some gorgeous art for a full blown series, and the music is top notch as well, which really draws you into the drama... if you cared for it to begin with. Overall though Gundam 00 is a lackluster experience that plays with some interesting ideas old and new, but is held back by cliche protagonist writing, dense and non-intuitive infodumping, and just some bad storyline choices in the third act.",

I went to Gundam 00 2nd because it's the highest rated Gundam on MAL and I'm not impressed. I didn't finish the show but unless it does a 180 I think I get the point.\r\nI think there are 2 main problems with this Gundam: \r\n1 is that it's 100% serious 100% of the time. I love a serious show but there is usually fun mixed in a little bit. This show is so serious that it ends up feeling bland and boring. Even if the comedy isbad it's still charming when a show attempts to be funny. This show has zero charm. \\n\\n\r\n2 is that the main character Setsuna is one of the worst main characters I have ever seen. He's like a Gundam himself, a robot with no emotion. Usually if a character is serious he's badass but this kid is not tough or funny. He has no personality.\\n\\n\r\nDon't let this 8.20 on MAL deceive you there are better Gundam shows than this, the original is better imo. This show may appeal to some people that love politics but it's just not for me. I'm going to move on to other Gundam shows that I think will entertain me far more.",

            "content": "Gundam 00 is not what I expected it to be. \r\nI have only a passing acquaintance with the Gundam franchise. My first encounter with it was Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket, which I'm told is hardly a typical Gundam series (though it is exceptionally good, and one of my favourite anime series). A couple of years ago I watched Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory, which was enjoyable enough but a little forgettable. So I had some slight idea of what Gundam entails, but no detailed knowledge and no experience of alternate universe versions like Gundam Wing. \r\nSo from that point of view, Gundam 00 isnot particuarly Gundam-like. Clearly it has a more modern visual style but it also feels entirely different, and the Gundams themselves serve a completely different function. In many ways there's no reason for it to be a Gundam series at all. The Gundam mobile suits in 00 could just as easily have been an original creation; I can't help thinking that a famous name (and identifiable visual design) was attached to this in order to attract an audience. \\n\\n\r\nFortunately, Gundam 00 is very good regardless. \\n\\n\r\nHaving only recently finished watching the series, the strongest lingering impression about it is moral ambiguity. This is a theme that persisted throughout the whole series, though it did weaken towards the end. The Gundam pilots working for the Celestial Being organisation are narratively the protagonists - they are the characters we spend the most time with and get to know in the most detail. But in many ways they could just as easily be the antagonists: they perform violent missions that could easily be (and frequently are) considered acts of terrorism, knowingly getting civilians killed in the collateral damage. Many of the supporting characters are on the other side of this divide; they are soldiers protecting their homelands from this erratic terrorist threat, or civilians who just happen to get caught up in events larger than themselves. Main character Setsuna F Seiei explains it very well himself when he remarks that it's hard to say who is right because both sides are justified. He's talking about a small civil war, but the sentiment can just as easily be applied to the whole series. Every faction does things that could be considered reprehensible, yet every faction also has good and understandable reasons for its actions. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no black and white in Gundam 00. \\n\\n\r\nThis determination to paint all deeds in shades of grey necessitates quite a large cast for perspective, and with many names and abbreviations to keep track of, sometimes it can become confusing. After 25 episodes I know the Union is based around the US, but I couldn't tell you which out of the other power blocs (the AEU and the Human Reform League) is where. Similarly, I have no idea which of the anti-Gundam commanders is affiliated with which authority. In many ways, the three power blocs that govern most of the world are interchangable. Still, while this makes it hard to follow the political manoeuvring, it also means that you don't really need to. It doesn't really matter which government is which, just that all of them fear and resent Celestial Being. \\n\\n\r\nThe characterisation continues this ambiguity. People do bad things in order to prevent worse things, or they do good things for bad reasons. Because we get the points of view of various characters with different affiliations and agendas, almost all the recurring characters are sympathetic, which leads to an interesting situation where (at least for me) it's impossible to root for one group or person. I wanted Setsuna to win his battles, but at the same time I wanted Graham Aker to win his - and the two of them often come into conflict. It's testament to the quality of the writing that I felt symapthy and support for so many characters with such different personalities and incompatible agendas. \\n\\n\r\nThere is still room for improvement in the characterisation though. I never particularly liked Saji and Louise, the token innocent high schoolers who we follow periodically. Saji is meek and inoffensive, but eventually his inoffensiveness itself becomes annoying. Louise is just an obnoxious brat, and I that felt any woe that befell her was largely deserved - probably not the reaction that was intended. Mercenary captain Ali al-Saachez seemed a bit of a caricature, gurning and snarling his way through his scenes as though in pantomime, though he could have been interesting if we'd learnt more about him. There is also a group of characters introduced halfway through, who never really get any development at all, and as a result come across as quite two dimensional and incidental. I neither supported nor opposed them; they were just there. \\n\\n\r\nStill, these are the exceptions. While no character is explored comprehensively, the main ones do get distinct personalities, and backgrounds that shape them in believable ways. In many anime series, the traumatic pasts of many of these characters would lead to endless bouts of dreary introspection or petulant outbursts, but they're mostly handled with maturity here. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, being a series about giant robots used in war, there are plenty of combat scenes. These are generally well done, though at times it can be hard to tell which mobile suit is which, particularly with the non-Gundam types. These scenes are energetic and well-paced, and they never seem to drag. Nor does the series indulge in the common anime practice of abusing action scenes; not once did I feel a particular confrontation had been crowbarred in just to keep the action content high. \\n\\n\r\nI think it's worth noting that, as I mentioned earlier, some of the series' qualities trail off in the final few episodes. The shades of grey become more clearly defined and we start to see some elements of a black and white/good and evil dichotomy appearing, but the troubled characters largely keep things on track. We also get the odd deus ex machina popping up as time goes on, but still far less than in many series. Combat understandably becomes more frequent as the series approaches its conclusion, but fortunately it remains fast-paced and compact. On top of this, the gradual development in the way the war is waged lends each action scene an additional draw. With each new battle I was eager to see how the military would attempt to counter the Gundams, and how far they would be able to succeed this time. \\n\\n\r\nCrucially, at no point does the series become a chore to watch. Even in its weaker moments it's still a high quality series, and aside from one reasonably short recap montage halfway through it never feels padded or slips into filler, nor does it wander off into rambling asides. The writing remains tight and focused, and ensures the series is an engaging watch to the very end. \\n\\n\r\nGundam 00 Second Season will pick up the story four years later, but I still have that ahead of me. Perhaps some of the weaknesses I mentioned in this series, particularly some under-developed characters, will be addressed there. Regardless, Gundam 00 is a series that is definitely worth watching. Gundam fans should be prepared for this bearing very little resemblance to traditional Gundam (at least the main/UC continuity), but it doesn't suffer for that. With plenty of action that doesn't outstay its welcome, troubled characters who don't overdo it, and a delightful moral ambiguity that makes a refreshing change from black and white conflicts, Gundam 00 is a well written series that should appeal to a broader audience than just mecha fans. Give it a try; it probably has something you'll like.",

            "content": "Sometimes you shouldn't complicate simplicity.\r\nGundam 00 is a peculiar installment in its franchise. Being an introduction into the Gundam franchise for many a fan, myself included, it has arguably become the most popularly viewed entry besides Wing. One could say that the writers looked at Wing and decided to take some of the base elements of it to create their own story that touched on war-related issues of the current times. Then that same person could say that they probably should have followed Wing just a little more loosely given how convoluted and nonsensical circumstances regarding the main group became.\r\nA group known as \u201cCelestial Being\u201dhas appeared in the distant future with one simple objective: fight to bring peace and end all war. Many factions across the globe disagree with their objective which seems aggressively contrary to their methods. Four young adult pilots, half of whom have been affected by war, are deployed by Celestial Being to stop disputes with force, relying on what Gundam fans have referred to as the \u201coverkill formula\u201d, in which single machines mow down dozens of mooks at a time. Sounds relatively simple enough as long as the show manages to highlight and keep track of the multiple factions. The idea comes with the potential to explore all sorts of concepts related to war, terrorism, protests, and global violence in ways unique to the timeline, while slowly peeling the layers of each major combatant. To an extent, 00 seems to capitalize on this potential, even showing a more personal example of what happens to civilians caught in the crossfires of battle. \\n\\n\r\nThen we get the robot equivalent to Dragon Ball Z\u2019s Kai-o-ken, an extra private faction that hijacks a poorly explained supercomputer the main protagonists\u2019 faction was using, a council that oversees all of this, even more private investors with their own agendas that get killed off unceremoniously, special particle beams that prevent healing, a myriad of poorly-conceived world-building mechanics that get dropped after what little exploration they had such as the space colonies, a badly done newtype-esque type attribute known as quantum brain-waves, and the knowledge that the series has dropped the ball in making sure we are able to keep up with every private faction. This isn\u2019t even going into the cloning, the innovade/innovator business, Zeta Gundam plagiarism and self-contradictions galore, the increased levels of over-complication in regards to the quantum brain wave mechanic that defines the timeline from the moment one of the main characters gets affected by it as early as episode 3 of season 1, and superpowers that allow communication with the dead, all of which occur in the second season!\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m sorry, was that overwhelming? Good; now you know what watching the 00 series is like!\\n\\n\r\nOne could argue that this series is best enjoyed without attempting to stretch your mental capacity to house all the convoluted nonsense and mental-gymnastics taken by the second half of season 1 onwards. Thanks to the flashy and well-animated mech battles with loads of colorful particles and explosions, and the sexy character designs that pave the way for many moments of casual semi-nudity without the need for fanservice, I\u2019d agree. The designs of each mech are nowhere near as iconic or memorable as those of most other installments, but they do serve their purpose in seeming like the aggressive war machines they are. The music, while certainly not up to Kenji Kawai\u2019s standard, has some decently memorable tracks that do an acceptable job of complimenting the plethora of fights shown throughout. The opening themes also serve well at getting people excited for each episode, as mediocre and often meaningless as each episode may be. They also represent the state of the show in each half, with the first being more simple and about characters getting to know each other and how things are beginning to play out, and the second being more chaotic and more intense in nature, as the action and overall emotional baggage rack up. Sadly, the ending themes, which do follow this, are less enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nFor anyone hoping the characters would provide much of the enjoyment you would likely obtain from the show, just know this won\u2019t likely be the case. The main 4 are mostly simple enough. Allelujah Haptism and Setsuna F Seiei (get used to these kinds of names) had the potential to be the most interesting in the show, given that the former suffers from split-personality disorder and that the latter, who is the main protagonist, is a more reserved and agitated chap who became a child soldier who grew to display trust and touch issues after being betrayed. They only somewhat capitalize on these personal aspects, more so for Allelujah than Setsuna, as the latter is largely Heero Yui from Wing, but with more baggage. Lockon Stratos is the most easy-going and friendly of the bunch, so many will deem him the most likable, even when the chips are down and he gets angry at his comrades or at terrorists. Contrast this with the initially unlikable and ultimately boring Tieria Erde. The rest of the astronomically large cast was largely tolerable, with very few standouts in positive or negative regards. The few exceptions include the fun and determined Graham Acker, the gloriously evil Ali al Saachez --both of whom are Setsuna\u2019s main rivals--, and a painfully disappointing trio that joins the main 4 in the second half. Few are badly written per se, beyond how the script becomes a joke towards the end, but most of the potential many of these characters had is lost, with the second season doing them no favors. You might enjoy the rest of the crew the main protagonists collaborate with, notably the commander, Sumeragi, but getting attached to the wrong crew member may cost you towards the end. They are likely the best characters in the show, given that they allow for some pleasant and even humorous interactions with the main cast and even each other. \\n\\n\r\nGundam 00 was a potentially captivating series squandered by an unchecked need for complication and drama. As such, its characters feel wasted and its world feels poorly developed and half-baked. You will find fun with the action scenes as well as a few of the side characters and their interactions, but you would want to treat this series as simpler than it actually is, lest you watch it start to be torn apart by the power of expectations and critical thinking. 00 goes downhill from here, so if you wish to start this, just know you\u2019re getting the best of what the timeline has to offer pretty early on.",

            "content": "I don't remember what it was at first that drew me to Gundam 00, because I ended up in love with it all too fast, which is why I'll try my hardest to toss aside any bias. \r\nI haven't seen any of the previous Gundams, I knew about them of course, but never actually sat down and watched them. Partly because 00 had a more sleek art style and partly because the instant contradictions within the plot and characters intrigued me. \r\nThis review may contain hints of spoilers, but nothing explicit and flat out. \r\nSTORY- The story is political, to say the least. Because thisis the first season, there's a lot of focus on why things are the way they are, the factions and their goals, observing them discuss, ect. I admit it's a little hard to keep up with sometimes once you feel it start to drone on. Thankfully, it's not that long, and just long enough to get the point across. What interested me the most was a point that was shown through the relationship between Setsuna and Marina. Celestial Being is trying to eradicate war, as they say, but they are fighting to do that. That itself is a huge contradiction, one that isn't ignored by the characters themselves. Setsuna in particular I remember musing over it. Marina on the other hand seeks peace, creating a good-hearted light of hope in all of the violence. The whole thing is very realistic and that was a drawing point. This isn't an alternate universe, this is a version of an imagined future.\\n\\n\r\nART- Again I'll say it, the sleek art is what drew me the most to 00. I'd seen the previous gundams, but never watched them because the designs nor the style caught me. The character designs themselves are very nice. A crazy crayola crayon box, but nice. Mobile animations and designs were done very fluidly and detailed. If anything, it's not an ugly show to watch at all. It's not full of big eyed girls with moe attitudes, there's a varied female design throughout. Same could be said for the males. While the girl designs feel more futuristic, the boys somehow feel more earthy to me. Still- that's just me.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND- No one's tracked how many times I've raved about 00's OP and EDs. They are the absolute best I've ever seen. The lyrics, the accompanying animation and the whole exhibition of it is produced beautifully. I'm one of those people who normally skip over OPs after so long and never really watch EDs, but every single time I watched both in 00. The soundtrack in itself isn't very noticeable nor memorable, though that didn't bother me much. I was too preoccupied with the OPs and EDs still, because I can't imagine such a string of beauty throughout a whole anime season for anything other than 00.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER- This is the point I have to strongly fight that bias. The hugest thing that kept me watching the series was the characters, who I found a relief from all the others that seem to be popping up. The relationships between them, the backgrounds... learning about the characters was a bit slow paced, but rewarding all the same. None of the meisters have had easy pasts. Allelujah finds himself fighting with a split personality from experimentation. Setsuna gained his cold and unaffectionate demeanor from his life as a child soldier. Tieria, an exceptionally mysterious character, isn't what you'd call fully human. Then even the guy who would light up the room with his smile, Lockon, carried a hatred for terrorists within his heart that clouded his judgement. \\n\\n\r\nAll of them bond. All of them grow closer without saying anything. Lockon in particular is to thank for these growths, because he is truly the shining light of the show. The one who unites all the others, smiling to help them grow. It's hard not to become attached to his magnetic personality, like him or hate him. Then there are the more minor parts of CB, including a socially awkward young girl who doesn't know how to express herself to people and finds solace in robotics, an alcoholic strategic who never misses a chance to have a drink, a friendly young adult woman who, despite the dreariness she's surrounded with, manages to keep an upbeat and sociable attitude. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course there are the antagonists, as well as everyone else. It's quite a cast. The Trinity siblings I felt, didn't get nearly enough screen time, being introduced more than ten episodes into the series, but they were dynamic. They shook up things wherever they went, and were nothing but a joy to see. Never dull. Nena Trinity, the youngest, does an excessively violent act late in the season that truly exhibits the sibling's ruthlessness. The antagonists were intriguing, but they too, I wished had more screen time to really let the viewers get a better feel. All the relationships were so complicated- it made the two civilians, Saji and Louise, stand out like a sore thumb in the cast. Very fun comic relief and a chance to see what's happening through a civilian's point of view. Ultimately, while the two may not seem important, gradually they gain almost the most character development throughout the cast, surprisingly enough. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT AND OVERALL- If you can sit through some politics, enjoy having your morals questioned and are willing to keep an open mind, it's a fantastic series and I recommend it. As many have said- it's an excellent gundam series to start off with.",

            "content": "Mobile Suit Gundam 00 is yet another addition to Sunrise's long running metaseries Mobile Suit Gundam, as well as the newest in the line of alternative universe Gundams. In a franchise as big as Gundam, it's very easy to get overshadowed by predecessors and living up to the namesake of Gundam is tough. After so many series, it's hard not to recycle the same material and Gundam 00 is no exception. But its unique execution and incorporation of realistic issues going on in this world makes this a series worth checking out by both long time fans and newcomers.\r\nStory\r\nThe premise of Mobile Suit Gundam 00focuses on the paramilitary organization/force known as Celestial Being, and their idealistic goal towards eradicating war through violence itself. Much like fighting fire with fire, the controversial goal of Celestial Being is embodied through mobile suits known as &quot;Gundams&quot; and their armed interventions.\\n\\n\r\nPitting a paramilitary force and its overpowered mobile suits against the world, you basically get a massive serving of shiny mech to mech action. Not exactly the most innovative. The story's essentially set up so the show can have as many mobile suit battles as possible; and frankly, that isn't a bad thing as long as it's toppled with good characters and drama. It's a decent story, but it's lacking some of the military aspects that Gundam is known for.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the main story, there's also a subplot involving two characters named Saji and Louise. Their purpose is to basically show the viewer the civilian standpoint of    Celestial Being's fight against the world's three superpowers. Which is probably the show's only source of slight comic relief and lightheartedness.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation\\n\r\nThe character designs of the four main Meisters are all quite well done. Much like Gundam Wing, the main characters are all pretty boys. Besides the main characters, we also have our blonde antagonist Graham whose appearance all-around gives the vibe of an ace pilot. Female designs are also done very well, such as Marina, who, though young, gives off a very motherly appearance; a very important aspect regarding her role in the plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe Mecha designs of Gundam 00 is very unique in that they're not rehashes of mobile suits from previous series. Gundam Exia (AKA the main main Gundam) offers a very simplistic and futuristic design; in fact, that goes to all the other mobile suit designs in this series. So unlike the Strike Freedom, the Gundams don't have a million things on their backs and enemies don't look overdone as if they were meant to sell model kits. The Mecha designs in 00 are, in my opinion, some of the best in the Gundam metaseries.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this series is absolutely stunning. You wouldn't find a prettier anime on this planet. Gundam 00 contains some of the most fluid Mecha action I've ever seen. The likes only rivaled by another Sunrise mech, Code Geass R2. Everything in this series is animation gold, from the shading and facial expressions of characters to the GN drive emitting  particles from the Gundams. It should be noted that there are some minor slip-ups, but they're passable and like mentioned, minor.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound (speaking of music, not sound effects)  in 00 is probably the weakest part of the entire series. This is one of the few things that its predecessor, SEED, is by far superior in. The soundtrack isn't necessarily bad, it just doesn't bring out the mood as effectively as it should. Though there are some great background music such as Fight, Counterattack, and Union. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP's and ED's on the otherhand are fantastic. Unlike SEED, new openings use different animation and things are actually MOVING and isn't a slideshow of pictures.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters in Gundam 00 are.. interesting. Can't say the score eight is definite as the second season hasn't aired yet. But judging solely on the first season, the characters are all quite reserved if not emotionless. Setsuna, being the main character, has a very interesting if not bloody background to him. Tieria is mysterious and strict, Allelujah is a character struggling with his mind, and Lockon  is easygoing and likable, though he harnesses a deep hatred towards terrorists.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters include the Char-like ace pilot Graham, war-loving Ali Al Saachez, and Human Reform League veteran soldier Sergei Smirnov.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast in general is a good cast, the characters aren't anything we haven't seen in Gundam before, but maybe that's a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nIt's an enjoyable series, especially towards the end. The Mecha action will glue you to the screen, the characters will make you empathize, and old time Gundam fans will have fun comparing it to Wing and/or finding the Char clone. The show also carries the 'Kill em all' kind of ending done by Director Yoshiyuki Tomino, something UC fans may fancy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nGundam 00 is by no means a deep show, it's the Gundam you know and love, with the usual war themes and ideology; all wrapped up in HD goodness. For newcomers, Gundam 00 is a fantastic introduction to the franchise. All-around it's a solid show. Gundam 00 proves once again how sitting in a cockpit while shouting out morals and personal philosophies is a win-win formula even after almost thirty years since its debut.\\n\\n\r\nGeneral impression, summary, and thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nStory: B+ :  A storyline you would expect from a mecha geared towards the Shounen demographic.\\n\\n\r\nArt &amp; Animation: A+ :  Good interesting mecha and character designs, fluid mecha action.\\n\\n\r\nSound: B :  Weak, forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: B+ :  The characters are there, they get developed but overall it's more plot-driven.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: B+ :  Another solid installment to the Gundam franchise, a promising ending setting up for the second season.",

            "content": "Sunrise seems to have a habit of producing series that simultaneously contain things I really like and things I really hate. In the end, the question always becomes which there's more of.\r\nSTORY - Sometimes, it's easy to become jaded with the Gundam franchise; it's always another war and another group of over-powered mechs piloted by super-capable teenagers. Each series seems to have its own unique set of deviations though, and that's undoubtedly why the franchise has survived for as long as it has. In 00's case, it's interesting to note that there's no clear-cut war between two factions. The world's existing conflicts are a mixof terrorism, civil war, and totalitarian oppression. Though morals are still cited a lot, there's no clear-cut definition of &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil,&quot; and our protagonists admit up front that they aren't necessarily &quot;good.&quot; Some of the politics are eerily similar to some real life current events, but it wasn't clear enough to me whether they were actually trying to make a statement about something or whether it was mostly coincidence. There are also some religious and environmental messages tossed into the mix, but again, not sure if any of it was supposed to be legitimate commentary. If anything though, Sunrise plays good politics.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonists, the paramilitary organization Celestial Being, declares its purpose to be the eradication of all war, and it aims to do so by intervening with all armed conflicts with their over-powered Gundams... and that's where the ground starts getting shaky. I never really thought the &quot;war to end all wars&quot; thing had much logic to it, but I can still enjoy a show with that sentiment at its core if the storytelling is all right and if events still seem to unfold logically. But Celestial Being was founded two hundred years prior to the events of the series, and all of their technology was developed then. And yet somehow, they are still mad over-powering against armies built on recent technology? Seriously? Realism does not compute. It's frustrating that not a lot is ever said/explained/discovered about the organization's origins throughout the course of the series, and I really don't understand the need for 00 to be split into two seasons. I don't buy that it's just the four year timeskip because Gurren Lagann proved that you could have a hugely significant timeskip mid-series no problem. \\n\\n\r\nFor the record, I hated the ending of this first season. It goes along fine for a while, but then we get this supremely rushed-feeling, arbitrary, and cobbled-together series of events that seemed to serve little purpose beyond hitting some sort of end-point for the season. And the thing I hate the most about Sunrise? Faked character deaths. Zombie characters. They're notorious for it, yes. No body means no death in Sunrise, but knowing this doesn't make it any less infuriating every time they do it. The Zombie problem alone made me disinclined to care about the second season, especially since I felt like they could have legitimately ended the series at 25 episodes if they had cut out a thus far pointless subplot and replaced it with relevant information about Celestial Being. Oh, Sunrise...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - Ensemble casts always wrestle with the problem of underdeveloped characters, and this is especially problematic in 00. It took me a really long time (probably at least ten episodes, which is way too long) to get into the characters and to care about them, and even then, my interest was limited. Of the four pilots, Setsuna's past is expanded upon the most, and I found it interesting the way the viewers' perception of him changed the more we learned even though Setsuna himself doesn't start to grow/change much until the near-end of the season. Allelujah's character and past isn't terribly inspired, but I think the acting really helped to garner audience sympathy to his case, and I liked the way his split personality was portrayed through reflections. \\n\\n\r\nLockon probably has the most terrible name pun ever (though H/Allelujah is pretty bad too), but I can live knowing that it's only a code name. That aside, he was probably the most generic of the pilots. Easy-going, friendly, righteous, and all that. Nothing special...except that his Haro is probably the most ridiculously adorable incarnation of a Haro ever. I also really appreciated the fact that there was some age disparity between the pilots. Setsuna is sixteen. Lockon is twenty-four. Everyone isn't a fifteen year-old kid! Oh, and Tieria? We never learn anything about Tieria, so I didn't really care about him at all. Sure, there's a whole 'nother season to explain things in, but I shouldn't need to wait that long to care. It's always a problem if I don't care about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters... ugh, there are just too many of them, and I didn't care about any of them. There were too many characters trying to play puppetmaster and making brief, unexplained appearances every few episodes, and none of them seem to have an interesting motivation or ambition. I am tired of characters trying to take over the world, and I'm sure you are too. Even Celestial Being's founder felt like he was trying to force the world into something... Marina Ismail? She was generic to the point that I had no sympathy for her for that reason alone. Graham Akre? I don't care about your vengeance-driving bullshit. Ali Al-Saachez? Don't care. Super Soldier #1? Whatever. The worst of it was the gigantic subplot involving the civilian characters. Their scenes were awkwardly woven into the politics, morals, and action, and I was thoroughly annoyed with all of it. Most likely, this subplot will lead up to something that (might hopefully kind of) be relevant in the second season, but that's too long of a build-up for me.\\n\\n\r\nARTSTYLE &amp; ANIMATION - The animation in 00 is pretty top notch. The mecha battles are slick, clean, and super entertaining to watch. The Gundam designs are fun and unique, and I'm especially fond of Exia (come on, anything with seven blades has to be badass). The other mech designs, as well as the battleship designs, are also pretty neat. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I found the character designs to be a bit lacking. Aside from Tieria's overt androgyny, I appreciated that they didn't have crazy wild appearances, and it is neat that many of the characters are supposed to be of different nationalities, but in the end, it's just supposing. If they never mentioned that Lockon is Irish, that Setsuna is Kurdish, that Saji is Japanese, you'd never know. Especially among the female characters, I felt like I'd seen them all before. Generic political figures, generic princesses, generic prettyboys. It didn't help that I had a hard time distinguishing some characters from others for a good five or six episodes; blame it on my own crappy memory and incompetence, but even so.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - Well, I'm pretty biased towards both opening themes for 00. As a L'Arc~en~Ciel fan, I loved &quot;Daybreak's Bell&quot; long before I ever saw this series, and as I'm currently on a Tomoko Kawase kick thanks to Soul Eater's second opening, I've come to really love &quot;Ash Like Snow&quot; as well. They're both great songs though, and I always love when the lyrics feel relevant to the actual series. The end themes didn't feel as exciting in contrast, but once again, it could just be my bias towards the two bands doing the openings. (Actually, I found the first end theme, &quot;Wana,&quot; to be pretty annoying...)\\n\\n\r\nThe background music for the series pales in contrast to its theme songs, as well as previous Gundam series like SEED, and other Sunrise mecha series like Code Geass. Very few tracks stood out to me during the series; the few that did were generally battle themes, but even those were pretty subpar. It wasn't terrible music, so it didn't really take away from the experience, but I'm sure a lot of scenes would have been better had there been a more emotional or meaningful soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING - Pretty average for the most part. Allelujah has a very unique-sounding and emotional voice; I think that's one of the reasons I warmed up to his character, and Setsuna was interesting in that he's one of the first monotone-voiced characters that didn't seriously annoy me. I appreciate the versatility of Miyano's voice -- it's very easy to distinguish his many roles. Beyond that, none of the other characters really stood out to me. Nothing amazing, but each character had a voice that suited them perfectly well.\\n\\n\r\nEdit; I saw one episode of the English dub (episode #11). Overall, it was pretty lulz-worthy. Tieria and Lockon both sound better than I expected, but they still feel awkward and unnatural, particularly Tieria, though I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that many of his lines are kind of corny. Setsuna didn't have a very big role in the episode, but the few lines he did have also impressed me. Swalie's voice is much more versatile than I thought. Cox on the other hand... Allelujah sounds terrible. The voice doesn't suit him at all and really made him seem like an entirely different character. Hallelujah is passable, but Allelujah fails utterly. Much of the secondary cast feels just as awkward, sadly: both Graham Akre and Billy Katagiri are very lulzy; Feldt and Marina are super generic, as are Col. Smirnoff and Soma; Sumeragi is actually pretty okay, but it can't be hard to sound &quot;okay&quot; when everyone else is just so... wtf. I don't think I'll be watching any more of the dub. The &quot;sound&quot; score component is not affected by the dub.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - I think this review might have turned out a bit more negative than I intended just because I'm still annoyed with the season's ending. You might wonder what I actually liked about 00. Well, I enjoyed the story and main conflict for the most part. It's always good to see a blurring of good and evil, especially when characters try so hard to convince themselves that they're doing the right thing. If I could score this series somewhere between a 7 and an 8, I would. 7 feels a bit harsh, but 8 feels too generous. I think 00's main problem is just that there are too many little details to the plot and few of them are explained properly; similarly, there are too many characters, and none of them get the attention they deserve. The intense build-up for the second season leaves this first season pretty void of substance, which is really disappointing. If you're going to divide up your forces, divide them evenly, huh? \\n\\n\r\nI'll see how this second season goes though, but Zombie characters isn't a really great place to start if you ask me.",

            "content": "maybe you've read it from somewhere or heard it before but let me state it again, Gundam 00 makes me reminiscent of Gundam Wing, one of the best Gundam series (in my opinion) with regards to story, character, and mechas.\r\nHowever, Gundam 00 have developed its own form of respect that made it surpass some other Gundam series in its own field.\r\nfor one, this is the best series so far that excelled much in art style, making efficient use of modern day technology to improve the graphic quality of this anime. from the sleek coloring and the defined mech designs, i believe that this series reeledit in.\\n\\n\r\nthe story may have an old feel with Wing but it certainly had its own touch of realism and feasibility in it. taking the old aspect of &quot;Gundams are justice&quot; and &quot;Gundams against the world&quot; Gundam 00 featured more struggle as compared to its predecessors. though the idea of one Gundam capable of taking on hordes of enemies is feasible at first (as it always have been in the Gundam series), this invincibility has been sabotaged ingeniously by the weakness of the pilots. like wing, no matter how powerful your mechas are, faced against quite a number of enemies, the chances of human error escalates, decreasing the capabilities of a God-like savior.\\n\\n\r\nit is in this respect that i really enjoyed Gundam Wing and now, Gundam 00. the paradox of powerful robots piloted by simple human beings gives this anime realism and puts limitations to one's imagination.\\n\\n\r\nalso, there are no overly-powerful mechas in Gundam 00. everyone has its drawbacks as if each were designed with balance in mind. \\n\\n\r\nExia for instance specializes in close combat capabilities but have difficulty with mid-range and long ranged fights. dynames specializes in ranged fire but have difficulty when the enemy gets too close. kyrios is maneuverable and well balanced but does not excel much in fields of long range and close range fights, it simply is maneuverable and has average capabilities. virtue has insane firepower that can take down mobs but wear out its energy is easily. to compensate for this, each unit is assigned with a partner best suit to back each other up. exia is paired with dynames for cover in long range while virtue is backed up with kyrios which easily dodges the energy cannon used by virtue.\\n\\n\r\nit is on this series that the concept of teamwork matters more rather than taking on them all alone. also, the mesiters know that it is best in warfare to finish enemies off before they increase in number as they would be having much difficulty later on. they know the rules of warfare and apply it on each of their battles.\\n\\n\r\ni also believe that the mesiter's roles and attitudes affect the &quot;humanity&quot; of their Gundams. their lack of experience, their constant complaints as to why the world is evil, their regrets and pains. i think that balances their mech's power, giving birth to a powerful being that's limits is exceeded by human will.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like to watch how one-sided losing battles are fought realistically, i recommend watching Gundam 00.",

Now i was planning on never seeing this series, but after talking with people who know a lot about mecha i decided to give it a shot, and wow was I very disappointed. The gundam pilots or as they are called in this show \"meisters\" have no depth to them at all. They have the personality of a paper plate and even after seeing their background nothing is really added to those characters. The gundam's themselves are over the topand so ridiculous at some points i couldn't help but laugh.  The one saving grace of this show are the enemies. Characters from the other 3 countries are pretty well developed, and pretty damn likable. The mecha designs are nice and realistic. For most of the show i found my self cheering for them hoping beyond hope that they would be able to beat the odds and defeat the gundam's. So overall its 3, its really just Gundam Wing with very likable bad guys.",

            "content": "I'm not going to compare Gundam 00 to any other of the Gundam series.  Gundam 00 is the only Gundam series to not take place in an alternate universe, but instead takes place in the future of our own.   \r\nThe year is 2309 AD.  With the exhaustion of fossil fuels, mankind split into three power blocs to build orbital or space elevators, brining a never ending supply of solar energy to the earth.  Despite this advancement, the three power blocs are still in a state almost equivalent to a Cold War, developing military technology to stay ahead of other powerblocs and competing in a space race.  The story takes place around the paramilitary organization Celestial Being, an organization founded over 200 years ago with its members sword to secrecy to achieve one goal: the eradication of conflict on Earth through armed interventions to unite the Earth before mankind ventures out further into space.  To achieve their goals, they utilize mobile suits called Gundams, technology generations in advance to that found on Earth.  With the beginning of their armed interventions, humanity and the three power blocs are forced to recognize and respond to Celestial Being.  Gundam 00 is an intriguing story of comraderie, corruption, betrayal, passion in the face of adversity, and a testament to humanity's desire to exist/\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Gundam 00 is unprecedented; almost the entire staff of Sunrise was utilized in its development.  Each mobile suit, whether it be a main Gundam or a minor suit of the power blocs, is exquisitely designed with outstanding detail.  It is hardly an exaggeration to say that there has never been a series in which mechas are so extravagent and breathtaking to see.  The background animation of countless different places on Earth and in space are amazing.  The artwork fully brings the universe of Gundam 00 to life in vibrant colors and designs.  The battle sequences are smooth and detailed.  Each character is given a unique look, unlike many animes in which all characters look the same spare different hairstyles and colors.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and sound effects in Gundam 00 are also outstanding, with opening themes done by major Japanese acts L'arc-en-Ciel and Brilliant Green, accompanied by excellent insert songs and endings as well.  Every movement and every attack in the battles is realistic and pulls you into the action.  The voice acting is also outstanding, producing Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor awards in the Seiyuu Awards of 2008.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fleshed out very well, especially the Gundam Meisters and Celestial Being's strategical planner, Sumeragi.  While a part of the show is to keep their backgrounds a mystery, as the details are revealed, their actions completely agree with their backgrounds, creating well-rounded and unique characters.  Even the civilian characters who give the viewers perspective of the affects of the Gundam's actions on Earth are very well rounded.  The reason holding me back from giving the characters a 10 is that there is still a second season coming (a continuation of the first) where more information will be revealed.  Right now, quite a bit of the main characters of Celestial Beings secrets are still hidden under layers, since their true identities are classified within the story.\\n\\n\r\nGundam 00 is for any type of anime viewer, from the casual to the mecha or Gundam enthusiast.  If the amazing artwork doesn't draw you in, the story and characters will or vice versa.  Even if you want to pay no heed to the story, the stunning visuals during battles are worth watching on their own.  Very rarely is there a wasted moment in the show, spare one recap episode told from a different character's perspective.  I can't possibly recommend this series more highly.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nBasically, there's a terrorist organization known as Celestial Being that carries out missions and plans to eradicate war and make the world a peaceful place, by using force and, well, violence. Their weapon that makes them so strong are the Gundams. This sounds like a maybe somewhat cliche plot that anyone can think of, like the whole fighting for peace stuff and all, but the idea really is elevated to an amazing level. So many twists, unexpected events, and trials all arise during the story that make is marvelous, which I'm not gonna go into detail about, for that would be spoiling. The story isn'treally amazing in the beginning, but it quickly becomes spectacular, and the build up to the second season is perfect.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation is pretty top-notch. Even with the intricate Gundam designs, I've never noticed any errors such as disproportional parts and such. Everything, form the beginning to the end, is done very well. The Gundam designs, as well as the character designs, were the best I've seen in the Gundam franchise. All of the fight scenes are greatly animated and well executed.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OPs and EDs are all very good and well suited for the series (I especially like Daybreak's Bell ^_^.) The sound effects are great, from the explosions to the sounds of beam sabers and beam rifles. The voice acting is also really good. All of the voices fit the characters nicely and were good choices. The background is pretty good as well, always fitting the scene quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nPeople can say they don't like how emotional and all the main cast can be at times, but in my opinion, I greatly prefer that over just 4 dudes that are just fighting for the hell of it and have absolutely no purposes for killing tons of people for their career on a daily basis. It makes the characters seem very real and deep, and gives them a lot of depth. The main cast, the 4 Gundam Meisters, are all really cool in my opinion, and all of them are very likable for their differences and certain qualities they all possess, as well as each of their individual pasts and their reasons for being Meisters.\\n\r\nHowever, what I think was good about this, was that the series also was able to focus on other side characters very well, particularly Louise and Saji, who although they don't seem to have much of an important role in this season, will probably be pretty important in season 2.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nGundam 00 is extremely enjoyable. The action and battles are magnificent, especially towards the end of the series. The drama and emotion portrayed is superb, again, especially during the sad moments towards the end of the season. The cast all have their own secrets that gradually are uncovered (to a certain extent,) and the story takes several turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. All these qualities make the enjoyment level simply outstanding, especially if you're a Gundam fan.",

            "content": "The Gundam franchise has been a part of my life now ever since I was re-introduced to the franchise thanks to Gundam Build Fighters and Gundam Iron-Blooded Orphans. Throughout my journey from this franchise I had seen a lot of great from this franchise but at the same time a lot of bad from this franchise.\r\nNevertheless, I still had a great time watching all of the Gundam shows from this franchise and I don\u2018t regret it one bit.\r\nThe U.C Gundam shows are mostly great sure they had its weak moments like ZZ and Victory but out of all the Gundam timelines, the U.C timeline isthe most polished of them all.\\n\r\nNow the alternate universe overall are hit or mess depending on your tastes and some alternate universe Gundam shows were good others ranged from meh to pretty bad.  \\n\r\nOut of all the alternate universe, Gundam shows Gundam 00 got the most praise from the franchise even surpassing Wing and Seed.\\n\r\n So with all that said does Gundam 00 deserve that praise and does it hold when compared to the other Gundam shows before and ever since?\\n\r\nHello, everyone, this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcome to my review of Gundam 00 seasons 1 and 2 and with that out of the way let\u2019s get started.\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe year is 2307 as the result of the depletion of fossil fuels humanity now had to search for a new source of power. The power was found in the form of solar-powered Dyson rings orbiting the earth and supported by three orbital elevators. Each orbital elevator was served by one of the three power blocks of the planet which consists of the Union, The Human Reform League and AEU (Advanced European Union). Despite having this near inexhaustible source of power it really only seemed to benefit the major powers and allies and because of these minor countries of the world plunging into poverty and constantly break out into warfare just for fuel and energy.\\n\r\nThis ongoing chaos led to the actual creation of a private organization called celestial being whose main goal to end wars and end humanity. To accomplish this they created four powerful mobile suits each piloted by four people called Gundam meisters.\\n\r\nThe four misters being Setsuna F Seiei, Lockon Stratos, Allelujah Haptism and Tieria Erde. Together they carry out various missions to intervene acts of war throughout the war while the three powers try to eliminate them.\\n\r\nThe story for Gundam 00 is pretty good overall but it has problems which mainly appears on season 2.\\n\r\nOne of the mains things that I liked the series mainly season 1 is how different it was when compared to the other Gundam shows. It does away with the standard full-scale warfare that we see before from most Gundam shows from the past and instead, it tells a story that tackles some of the modern topics that the world is facing around that time such as religious and terrorism. I really adored where the first season went with this as it questions celestial beings motives. This is the stuff that I loved about Gundam. The first season made think about the issues that we have to face in everyday life. I was really invested in it.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I cannot say the same thing for season 2 because it took most of the stuff that made season 1 great and throws it away in favor of a standard faction vs faction story that we see seen before. Not only that but the writing season 2 not that good when compared to season 1 where the writing was pretty strong for the most part.  Not to mention some of the topics and themes that was introduced in season 1 got preachy in season 2. It's not Wing or Seed Destiny level of preachiness but it was still preachy nonetheless. The last thing that I want to mention is the pacing. Unlike Seed and Seed Destiny where the pacing was broken beyond repair thanks to having a lot of flashback sequences, 00 pacing was a bit too fast at times especially in season 2 where it becomes a big problem for the narrative and character development.\\n\r\nOverall the story for 00 is pretty alright for the most part. Season 1 by itself is pretty good that did a good job at tacking modern topics as well having good writing for the most part despite the small pacing issues in season 1. Season 2 however, is okay at best where it may had some great moments now and then it but was ultimately lackluster in the writing and pacing department not to mention the themes and topics got incredibly preachy in season 2.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nThe characters in Gundam are pretty enjoyable for the most part especially in season 1, however, feel like most of the characters in 00 don\u2019t have much character development thanks to the fast pacing of 00 and it begins to the bite the show in the ass season 2.\\n\r\nI will save the 00 boys for last but let\u2019s talk about the other characters starting with Saji and Louise.\\n\r\nI was honestly shocked at how much I liked them in season 1. At first, I thought these two were a waste of screen time however as the first season progresses I understood what the first season intended to do with them. They are normal people living normal lives that sadly get caught in a tragedy by the end of season 1 that changes them forever which was shown in season 2. Unfortunately, while I liked how Louise and Saji changed in season 2 I didn\u2019t like them as much in season 1 especially Saji who for became a Shinji Ikari clone where he spends most of the show whining and doing dumb shit for no reason. It\u2019s such as shame really because I liked Saji in season 1.\\n\r\nGraham was a pretty cool character in season 1 and I really liked his determination of how he wants to beat a Gundam in battle. Unfortunately, he devolved into a shitty Char clone in season 2 and he didn\u2019t really do anything apart trying to 1v1 with Sestuna and whine a lot.\\n\r\nAli al-Saachez is a pretty badass character in season 1 he was easily my second favorite charters in season 1. I loved how Sasschez was such a great rival/enemy to Setsuna and they conflict with the other was always a joy to watch. However unlike Graham who devolved into a mediocre character in season 2 he still remained a badass but now playing in second fiddle which is honestly sad.\\n\r\nFeldt is a character that I really liked. In the beginning, she was an anti-social girl who barely says anything unless she has to. However, as the series progresses she starts to open up the Celestial Being crew as she starts feeling more comfortable\\n\r\nNow if there was a character that was useless to the overall plot than it would be Marina who is by far one of the worst characters from the Gundam franchise. All she did in the series is preach about human understanding to Setsuna and writing a song that ultimately lead to nothing. As much I hate Relena from Gundam Wing least she redeemed herself in the movie Endless Waitz where she finally understands that she can\u2019t achieve peace by preaching about pacifism and she far less annoying in that film. Say what you want about Saji and Louise but least they're felt like characters that a purpose in the narrative instead of being a useless plot device like Marina.\\n\r\nThe villains in 00 not counting Ali al Saachez were pretty underwhelming at best as they don\u2019t have any motives other than taking over the world and humanity. You dropped that ball on that one Sunrise.\\n\r\nNow that\u2019s all the other characters done now let\u2019s talk about the 00 boys.\\n\r\nTieria was really annoying at first as he liked to be a total dick to everyone in Celestial Being and he was gladly to eliminate anyone who puts the plan in jeopardy. He eventually opens up over time and despite being the most feminist of the group I thought he was a pretty forgettable character that I didn\u2019t like.\\n\r\nThe first Lockon being Neil Dylandy is my favorite character in the series. I loved his easy-going nature as well-being the most sociable out of the 00 boys\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t like the second Lockon Lyle Dylandy at first but the series went on I started to like him a bit thanks to him being a very skilled pilot as being kinda likable in the second half of season 2 however at times I feel he can be a total asspuller like Suzaku in Geass R2.\\n\r\nAllelujah is a pretty interesting character as he has a split personality that appears every time he goes into battle. However, I feel the writers never really went anyway with it and it became almost irrelevant when you get to season 2 where he starts forming a love interest to Marie due to them being both experimental super soldiers of HRL in the past\\n\r\nFinally, we have Setsuna who is one of the better Gundam protagonists from the franchise. Setsuna was once a child who slayed his parents to prove his loyalty to God but ultimately became disillusioned and grew to hate conflicts overall which lead him to join celestial being. In a nutshell, Setsuna is Heero Yuuji done right because not only much better-written character who compare to Heero who was a bland, contrived and stoic idiot from start to finish but Setsuna actually has character development. Throughout the series we see Setsuna trying to fix his own mistakes during his child soldier days. Also, Setsuna has an actual personality. Sure he starts off being as a stoic person after being traumatized during his child soldier days but as the series goes on he starts to express his feeling to people without reservation not to mention he starts to become more human instead of a stoic soldier.\\n\r\nOverall the characters in 00 were pretty enjoyable for what they were despite they shortcoming but having mostly underdeveloped characters thanks to the show fast pacing as well as many characters getting downgraded in season 2.  Besides that, I thought the characters were enjoyable\\n\r\n6.5/10\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nVisually Gundam 00 is a massive step up when compared to the cosmic era of Gundam being Gundam Seed and Gundam Seed Destiny. The background scenery is amazing to look at that is filled with color that blends well with the tone of the series. The character designs were done by Risa Amada who goes by the pen name Yun K\u014dga and while haven\u2019t check out her works but she has her own manga series called Loveless. Compared to Hisashi Hirai where most of the characters designs are the same from the Seed series Yun Koga did a good job at with the characters designs however I feel like some of the male characters look more feminine.\\n\r\nAs for the actual animation is honestly amazing. The fight choreography was great for the mechs, character movement is fluent and there was no stock footage used. Thank god because after watching Wing and Seed I got sick of seeing recycled footage all the damm time.\\n\r\nIf I had any complaints with the animation then it would be the overkill formula. Okay the overkill formula in 00 is not as bad when compared to Seed and Wing but it was still kind of an issue for me especially in season 2\\n\r\nThe mecha designs in 00 are pretty good overall and they were pretty original for the most part and like the mechs in Wing and Seed they all have their own gimmicks and strength but I feel they did a far better job at showcasing the mechs in 00 compare to Wing and Seed.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for 00 is fantastic and it\u2019s the war tone for the series very well. Easily one of the best soundtracks from the franchise.\\n\r\nThe season 1 openings and endings themes are pretty great overall and they are very memorable especially the second opening theme Ash Like Snow which is my all-time favorite Gundam opening theme as well-being my fourth favorite anime opening period.\\n\r\nThe season 2 openings and endings themes are not as great and memorable as the season 1 but they were pretty enjoyable for what they were.\\n\r\nNow for sub vs dub.\\n\r\nI only seen bits of the sub for 00 but I remember the sub being pretty good.\\n\r\nThe dub for 00 is pretty as it featured a lot of well-known voice actors from the other Gundam shows in the past.\\n\r\nBrad Swaile who previously voiced Amuro from Gundam 0079, Quatre from Gundam Wing and Dearka from Gundam Seed returned to voice the protagonist Setsuna and he honestly did a great job voicing Setsuna.\\n\r\nChanta Strandwho previously voiced Lacus and Meer from Gundam Seed + Destiny returned to voice Feldt and she once again did a solid job voicing Feldt.\\n\r\nScott McNeil who previously voiced Duo from Gundam Wing returns to voice Ali Al-Saachez who has the best performance in Gundam 00. He was fantastic as voicing Ali Al-Saachez.\\n\r\nIn short both languages are great.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nAfter watching Gundam 00 as well buying the out of print DVDs from Beez Entertainment UK at my local Cex store how good was it. Well, I think it\u2019s a good Gundam series for the most part. Do I think it\u2019s the best Gundam series ever made? Obviously not. I don\u2019t think it holds up as well as other Gundam shows like G, X, Build Fighters Season 1 and Turn A but it feels it\u2019s better than the likes of Wing, Build Fighters Try, Seed + Destiny and Victory. I feel like Sunrise did a good job with the series as it fixed a lot of problems that had with Wing and Seed. The first season alone is a great Gundam show that had a lot of interesting in it as well having fun and likable character. Not to mention the writing for the first season was pretty solid. It has some problems though. The pacing at was way too fast times especially in season 2 the characters aren\u2019t the most developed bunch I seen in a Gundam show and season 2 as a whole is inferior in the writing department where it resorted of using a mediocre plot that we all seen before from Gundam shows from the past. Not to mention many of the characters got downgraded in season 2 and because of those reason along 00 season 2 is okay at best but when compared to season 1 is pretty disappointing. Despite its shortcomings mainly in season 2 I still recommended Gundam 00 for people who want to start watching Gundam but doesn\u2019t want to start too far back to the U.C Gundam shows.\\n\r\nSeason 1 score 8.5/10\\n\r\nSeason 2 score 6.5/10\\n\r\nOverall Score 7.5/10\\n",

            "content": "Gundam 00 was the first Gundam series I've actually finished, and I actually found it very entertaining. Hearing about the failure of its predecessor, Gundam Seed Destiny, I initially approached this series with some apprehension, but that was all forgotten at the first episode.\r\nStory: The plot of the story is...unusual. Basically, 299 years from now, there is a private military group main objective is for the eradication of armed conflict through their Gundams. Basically, to destroy war, they will fight it (Quite ironic) The story of Gundam 00 is filled with politics, and on average, an episode will consist of more than half the episodecontaining political matters. Despite it sounding tedious, the political significance in Gundam 00 is what makes it stand out, and it shows us the World of Gundam 00 through a different perspective. Another thing unusual about Gundam 00 is that there is no clear &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; side. The show is viewed through 3, main different perspectives; The civilian's, the main factions, and Celestial Beings, and whilst Celestial Being's goal sounds like a good idea, the views from another perspective show it differently, such as their interference with global conflict caused terrorist groups to attack innocent civilians. This element alone makes Gundam 00 very interesting to watch, and it doesn't follow the cliche that the main characters are the &quot;good&quot; guys, and their goal is marred by the &quot;bad guys&quot;, but rather, it shows the good and bad of all perspectives.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I will say, the art in Gundam 00 is very good, and it is particularly outstanding when showing mobile suits. This is nothing like Gundam Seed/Destiny, absolutely no stock footage reused. The battle animations are all of extreme high quality, and they are amazing to watch. Unfortunately, battle sequences tend to be quite short, tending to last less than 3 minutes. The mech designs also look very well designed, whether they be the Gundams, the Overflags, the GN-Xs, etc... The people themselves also look very nice, and the females of their series look particularly beautiful with their &quot;00&quot; figures (Great breasts).\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound quality is on the same level of Gundam Seed/Destiny, but it sounds completely different. Whilst GS/D have excellent pop music accompanying the series, the music in Gundam 00 shines particularly during battle sequences. The battle music is plentiful, and there is a lot of variety to match the many moods of the fights throughtout the series. The OP and EDs are, surprising, all great tracks, particularly the two OPs. The VAs also did very well, although it was a bit odd seeing Rie Kugimiya voice Nena Trinity (Who had a very well developed figure, in contrast to the loli figured characters Rie Kugimiya is famous for voicing).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is where Gundam 00 falls a little short. The main characters did not really recieve any character development until halfway through the series, and were generally quite bland. Tieria in particular was quite an unappealing character, because he felt the current Gundam Meisters were not fit for their roles, until later on, when he started to warm up and the Meisters truly worked as a team. Saji and Louise are shown frequently in Gundam 00, and were quite annoying until the death of Louise's family caused by Celestial Being near the middle of the anime. There is a lot of character history as well, and it is often shown how it has affected them and why certain characters act in a certain way.  Overall, character development really accelerated for the main cast shortly after the Trinities appeared.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Gundam 00 was a very enjoyable show to watch every week, because the show content was interesting, the fights were beautiful, the political dialogue was intriguing, and because it was different from all the other shows. I definitely like how the battles were evenly matched when the Gundams were outnumbered, when their opposition as superior stratagetic thinking, and when the factions obtained same-level mobile suits, to show us the flaws of Celestial Being and the fact that they are not all powerful.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I consider this a very realistic (Compared to all the animes out there) anime, and it's quite pleasing to see that they managed to merge real-life issues (Post 9/11 mood) and present this show in a &quot;grey&quot; view, as opposed to the usual black and white. I recommend this show for anyone who truly appreciates quality over quantity (battles), an interesting story and mechs. This is only the first half, and the highly anticipated second half airs this fall.\\n",

            "content": "Quick Note: This review will occasionally mention references to other entries in the Gundam franchise for comparison's sake as well as quality of execution compared to other entries, while also making this review as friendly as possible to people who have no experience with the franchise. Please note that this review ONLY includes the first season.\r\nI am also more than willing to answer any questions if any part of this review is not instantly understood by the readers. Anyway, onto the review.\r\nThe Gundam meta-series is a colossal franchise in Japan, not unlike the Star Wars or Star Trek franchises in the West. The franchise spawnsanime series, OVAs, movies, novels, manga adaptations and had received previously unrivaled popularity in Japan thanks to its compelling story-lines, simplistic but well-thought out dialogue, like-able and most importantly well-developed characters. The franchise hasn't, unfortunately, been as successful with the Western audience and thrown aside due to unpopular stereotypes people who dislike certain entries in the franchise keep ranting about, ranging from how the characters never die apparently, to how the mechs have plot armor when the pilots are inside them, to how naive and idealistic the main characters are to how forced the element of understanding is. While these stereotypes do apply to certain entries, they do not apply to all of them and are overly exaggerated by the inexperienced viewers of the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nHow well does the first season of Gundam 00 do then? Is it a return to the glory days of the Universal Century timeline (for those who don't know, the first Gundam timeline) or is it yet another pointless cash grab after the atrocity that was SEED Destiny and just another stain in the franchise's name?\\n\\n\r\nTo begin with, Gundam 00 has a very unique and interesting, if a bit idealistic at first, premise. An organization led by a man who died over 200 years ago has come with four overpowered machines to bring peace to the world and fight, as the series puts it, a \"war to end all wars\" and obliterate conflict.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the obvious reference to World War I, the first season is extremely morally gray and it becomes clear quickly that there are good people fighting on almost all sides. The show is obviously centered around the four Gundam pilots, but it is a genuinely pleasant surprise to see that the series focuses on letting us know how people from around the world feel about this conflict. All sorts of opinions about how people perceive the coming of the Gundam pilots and the advantages and disadvantages that such an organization brings with it helps make the viewer feel that they are part of the world these characters are living in. The other parties involved in this conflict and the soldiers who fight for them against the threat that was Celestial Being are also ambiguous, which helps us understand and sympathize with these characters rather than merely see them as one note villains (if they are villains at all in the eyes of the viewer).\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect that is extremely well-done in 00 aside from how well the setting and viewpoints are fleshed out are the extreme resemblance certain events in the show have with actual political events (9/11 in particular, not unlike Gundam SEED), and this is made especially obvious with the Middle Eastern crisis where the power blocs in the show decide to toy around with that region of the world, to the point where the region is so divided that the power blocs continue exploiting it through both direct and indirect means. The aspect that deserves special praise is how it portrays religious extremism in an effective manner without making all people who believe in religion retards, but instead showing that there are good people (I'm emphasizing this a lot, I know) on every side fighting for what they believe in.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is not perfect however, and Celestial Being have too much plot armor at the most convenient moments. The battles are still intense for most of the show and they are paced well enough within the main story without detracting from the value of the battles or the plot, but the flaw still stands and the season goes on for too long without answering important plot related questions where I felt it could have answered everything and ended here. Nevertheless, the show still gets a high score because at the end of the day, a flawed plot with well-explored themes sounds much better than a plot with no loopholes but hardly any substance or value.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Sunrise have thankfully improved greatly in this aspect from their dismal performance in Gundam SEED Destiny. The animation is amazingly fluid with very few repeated frames during the battles and series in general, and special mention goes to the opening scene for looking absolutely gorgeous. The coloring fits the mood of the show while at the same time looking colorful and vibrant rather than dull and lifeless, which is an enhanced advantage that carries over from Gundam SEED (which, with all its flaws was still a very colorful show). The same cannot be said for the artwork, which while well above-average feels out of place for a show like this. Every girl has massive breasts (because lord forbid that women don't have giant breasts) and every man in the show looks... well, questionable? Tieria gets special mention here, considering I haven't seen a single person who I've introduced this show to mention him as a guy. As well as having purple hair. But anyway, the artwork is a far cry from bad, and the characters have very distinct facial expressions and features, which is better than them having the same face with different eye colors and hair colors like most anime series, so this show still looks great despite the fact that I personally feel that a more seinen like art-style would work better with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn't particularly memorable (save for perhaps the battle music) though it does fit the mood of the show and I do not think that I can remember any moments where the sound effects felt wrongly placed or the wrong piece of music played at the wrong time.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was well-done and all the voices fit the characters (special mention here goes to Setsuna's Mamoru Miyano and Smirnov's Unsho Ishizuka). The opening and ending songs are AMAZING, special mention goes to the second opening, Ash Like Snow and second ending, Friends. The English voice acting is decent and lacks the questionable Engrish of the sub, but I found the subbed version easier to emotionally invest in. The dub is still passable if you only watch dubs, but I personally recommend the subs more. The dub deserves a special mention for the AMAZING performance of Setsuna's Brad Swaile, who perfectly captures Setsuna's cold, distant yet tragic character.\\n\\n\r\nGundam 00 has a variety of interesting characters, which are all interesting in their own right.The Gundam pilots are the stars of this show and their interactions with each other and other characters as well as their backgrounds are the most interesting part of the show. There's the soldiers fighting on the other sides as well, most notable of which are Graham Aker who is Setsuna's main rival as well as Smirnov and Marie, who provide a more mature perspective to the show. The other characters are unfortunately not as interesting and tend to be used as plot points to drive the themes of the show forward, which while leads to some interesting character development for some of them (Saji and Louise deserve mention here) still feels forced and not as compelling as it should have.\\n\\n\r\nThe best character of this show is undeniably Setsuna, who a lot of people would consider a mash up of Sousuke from Full Metal Panic and Heero from Gundam Wing. I consider these comparisons superficial at best, since Setsuna feels more compelling due to his past and beliefs than either of them (though Sousuke is funnier and Heero has nostalgia behind him). Speaking about any character in this show would contain spoilers, unfortunately, so I'll merely state that all four Gundam pilots are compelling due to his past and beliefs than either of them (though Sousuke is funnier and Heero has nostalgia behind him). Speaking about any character in this show would contain spoilers, unfortunately, so I'll merely state that all four Gundam pilots are compelling characters which stand on their own from their respective archetypes despite having unnerving similarities to the characters from Wing (Setsuna being similar to Heero, Lockon to Duo, Allelujah to Trowa and Tieria to Wufei).\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs a Middle Easterner, this show was a breath of fresh air in the sea of a lot of shows that attempt to be morally gray about religious conflicts but failed. The series is extremely entertaining and offers something for the viewer that wants something intelligent as well. There are flaws, but they are not enough for me to say that they stood in the way of me enjoying this show; I highly recommend this show and wholeheartedly recommend the franchise as a whole, as there is very little to regret and a lot to love.\\n\\n\r\nThank you very much for reading this review!",

            "content": "Gundam Wing, Gundam G, Gundam Seed, Gundam Seed Destiny etc... There are so many gundam series out there so why bother watching another gundam saga?\r\nStory:\r\nSet in the year 2307 AD, Gundam 00 focuses on Celestial beings and their aim to eradicate war through force with the use of mobile suits known as Gundams.\r\nWell, almost all people have a view of what the gundam story is like: aiming for peace and there\u2019s mech to mech battle. This one has somewhat the same scene, but the only difference is that gundams in here are contradictory to what people think gundams should be. In here, the protagonists (gundams)are the ones using force to fight those that pose a threat to peace even though there's \"no action of war yet\" therefore creating chaos. So this is a twist to the usual gundam story, wherein people\u2019s impression is that gundams bring peace and are the saviors.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the missions of the Gundam Meisters to eradicate war, there is also a light subplot involving Louise and Saji. They stand on the civilian side\u2019s point of view, and I guess, this is the light part of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe story doesn\u2019t present a one-sided view point, but presents to us a multi-view point story line. It not only presents the view point of the main character \u2013 Celestial Beings, but also the view point of the opposing force \u2013 AEU, UNION and HRL and even the civilian\u2019s view point \u2013 Saji and Loiuse.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 10\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\r\nThe characters are well done. Main characters are pretty boys and girls. Antagonists aren\u2019t drawn one sided. There\u2019s Ali Al Sachees\u2019 appearance that gives a creepy war freak feeling and Graham\u2019s appearance gives of a feel of ace pilot.\\n\\n\r\nThe mecha designs are very unique. The mechas in here have simplistic and futuristic design and is innovative \u2013 not using energy wings or boosters.\\n\\n\r\nThe series boasts of awesome high definition visuals. The animation is very fluid and very detailed. From the movement of the gundams down to the emission of the GN particles everything is exquisitely done.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are very interesting. The main characters each have a different vibe. There\u2019s Setsuna F Seiei who is silent but not emotionless, Allelujah who has a split personality, Lokon who is easygoing, Tiera who is very mysterious and strict but caring.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also Marina Ismail, a very na\u00efve princess that gives off a motherly image. She saw the world in a different view point because of Setsuna and I think she's similar to WINGS's Releena. Although the only difference is that Releena has more power and has a firm resolve than Marina.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast overall is excellent.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe fast paced plot, action and mecha fights will keep you glued to your seats. The mystery behind each main character will keep you asking for more. Fans may compare it to WING but it still has its own charm and originality.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI say its story line is unpredictable especially the last episode. All in all,  Gundam 00 has again marked its own place in the realm of mecha animes. I say this is the way mecha anime should be.",

            "content": "As a first-time Gundam watcher, i must say this show really is something.\r\nStory: - 9.3/10 (A)\r\nThe story is about Gundam Meisters who work for Celestial Being (catchy name lol), a group who's main goal is to permanetly stop wars while fighting. Stopping war with more war? Well, it's odd but somehow interesting. We have Setsuna F. Seiei, the newest Meister and well, a cheery fellow. (His name means pain, ain't that perfect for him?) Next we have Hallelujah (Hallelujah!!! lol i had to do that), a Meister with an odd past. He has another side to him called Allelujah (Take out the H), a moreevil and sinister person. Interesting.. . Next we have Tieria Erde, a really depressing guy (guy right?) who follows the rules to where we want to call him a geek.  And then we have Lockon, a really funny guy with a cool little sidekick with wise cracks. So in other words we have: Two depressing people, one cheery, and one who's half and half. Now that's a bringer.Then we have Saji and Louise, the characters that show a regular person's view of the whole Celestial Being deal. Really interesting there, i like that concept. I'm a sucker for political/mecha/shounen anime, so this really won't disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: - 9.5/10 (A)\\n\r\nIt seems every scene of Gundam is beautifully animated. The fights do not disappoint. Sometimes it can be way too animated to where it looks ridiculous and sometimes it's really well animated on a scene where it doesn't have to.\\n\\n\r\nSound: - 7.9/10 (C+)\\n\r\nThe music isn't so memorable, however. The pieces are amazing, but you forget them the next episode. The first OP, &quot;Daybreak's Bell&quot; is a instant favorite. I don't listen to the ED's, however i can just as speculate they are good as well. Next is &quot;Ash Like Snow&quot;, a good &quot;before an ultra mega fight&quot; song, but after listening to it 100 times on my iPod i suddenly got tired of hearing it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: - 9/10 (A-)\\n\r\nWell, like many popular animes, Gundam is no stranger to the hype that is known as &quot;Having many characters makes you look awesome&quot;. But unlike most shows, Gundam manages to give each character a reasonably good amount of airtime. From the Union to the A.E.U to the Human Reform League, we got a ton of characters. Sure i can't name them all, but i can remember their faces pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: - 9.1/10 (A) / Overall (Averaged): 8.96/10 (B+)\\n\r\nGundam 00 is definetly a show worth watching. I know, i know: &quot;I've had it with mecha anime!&quot;. We've all seen Macross, Geass, and Gurren Lagann but they all fail in comparison to Gundam (mainly because Gundam has been around since 1979). I'm definetly buying the DVD's, even donating to Sunrise for their hard work on this great show.",

            "content": "I basically feel that this anime has enough reviews so I give a different one: The review your are about to see is mostly about the comparison of Anno Domini to the Cosmic Era. Why? It is the successor of the mega-hit Gundam Seed and GS Destiny. Fangirls/ boys may still demand cute lovey-dovey characters or enthusiasts might want a deeper and more unique plot. So I hope that this review may help people  who watched GSD that included Gundam 00 in their \"to watch\" list and those who evaluating it.\r\nSTORY:\r\nCosmic Era\\n\r\nDrama:     more intense and plentiful                  \\n\r\nAction:      repetitive but good,relies on Gundam's power                 \\n\r\nRomance: plenty &amp; unexpected                         \\n\\n\\n\r\n Anno Domini:\\n\r\nDrama:more natural and untypical\\n\r\nAction: very excellent and intelligent with strategy and teamwork\\n\r\nRomance:close to none\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen the Cosmic Era heavily focuses on the internal drama of the main characters AD portrays a different kind of heroism. When they both condemn war yet clarifies that fighting is necessary to live, CE roots this to human emotion and desire. Two sides fighting for noble or distorted reasons alike are both victims in a tragic war. Meanwhile, AD tackles this issue in a more realistic way by directly relating it to our current world- oil crisis, terrorism, economic turmoils. Furthurmore, those are challenged by a small group of people -the Celestial Beings- with four powerful mobile suits. \\n\\n\r\nGundams vs the world? Sounds ridiculous? It works. But it is amazing that the story is woven pretty well for that idea to be utterly plausible and workable. In addition to this, even with the limited character interaction due to huge distances, each's action affect the overall picture- in a way, everyone is related to one another.  Moreover, while the presence of &quot;evil&quot; leaders are prevalent in Gundam series, AD is a bit different: it shows that humanity as a whole conflicts within itself.\\n\\n\r\nAD is pretty original, but compare to CE, its execution is a bit slower. Though containing a number of unnecessary flashbacks, CE seems to be a bit faster than AD even with 50 episodes .Also, for many times, AD put together subplots with thin links with each other; lastly, its worst trait is that it has no climax or weak climax.\\n\\n\r\nWinner: None\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\\n\r\nCosmic Era                                       \\n\r\nConsistency: A bit bad                                    \\n\r\nArt style:       Familiar but eye candy cute                    \\n\r\nQuality:        High quality traditional                           \\n\r\nMechs:         So many cool designs      \\n\\n\r\nAnno Domini\\n\r\nConsistency:Superb!\\n\r\nArt style: Serious tone\\n\r\nQuality: HIGH DEFINITION\\n\r\nMechs:    More detailed, vivid, innovative and memorable\\n\\n\r\nAD is obviously superior in the category of quality and &quot;hi-tech&quot; factor but the character designs' appeal to the fanbase (especially the fangirls) is a bit inferior due to its less cuter style.\\n\\n\r\nWinner: AD\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\n Cosmic Era:              \\n\r\nDramatic techno-pop with traditional space mood music mixed with dramatic    and romantic ballads     \\n\\n\r\nAnno Domini:\\n\r\nAlternative rock, pop and rock    ballads coupled with &quot;epic&quot; sounds and contemporary sounds tracks\\n\\n\r\nAD lost to this one, CE's music is very successful in bringing out emotions, mixing drama, romance, action and suspense.The openings and endings are a bit radical by defying the Gundam tradition of techno, and it was satisfying. However, AD is a bit disappointing: the tracks are not memorable and some are repetitive, they are a bit typical since one can hear them on most shonen shows.\\n\\n\r\nWinner: CE\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\\n\r\n                   Cosmic Era                                        \\n\r\nCast:  Typical teenagers and            \\n\r\n                  some adults   \\n\r\nDialogues: Excellent and thought            \\n\r\n                  provoking                                        \\n\\n\r\nAnno Domini:\\n\r\nCast:  Mix of different lives\\n\r\nDialogues: Natural, lacks intensity due to indirect confrontations and and the lack of clarity on why certain characters are taking screen time.\\n\\n\r\nCE is much more focused on duty, death, love, hate and understanding- the aspects of humanity. The conflict is seen in the feelings and choices of individual people developing as they interact with others. Heart wrenching indeed, but one can also say that they designed their characters based on basic stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where AD takes its radicalism; the characters are already very much developed and the focus is in the overall conflict involving their lives, both past and present. Different people, same effects. Same actions, different effects. It's theme is living in a supposedly sick world. Beautifully, the symbolism of necessary sacrifice and undeserved pain is reflected. Sadly, the dialogue fails to amplify these elements. Though sadly, though the concept is pretty, many characters are generic.\\n\\n\r\nWinner: CE\\n\r\nENJOYMENT AND OVERALL:\\n\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed CE more than AD because of my preference, but it doesn't mean that it is better. Still, both of them are shows that deserves praise. \\n\\n\r\nCE offers more intensity and impact, however it has flaws like unnecessary fanservice, inconsistencies, bad flasbacks and irrational coincidences.\\n\\n\r\nAD has better character as a whole, free of &quot;impurities&quot; of fanservice and &quot;advertising&quot; of profitable models. It may be close to zero in flaws but it definitely &quot;lacks.&quot;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Well, it's truely been a while since I wrote a Gundam review. Yes, I've basically written a review for nearly every Gundam series for those who don't keep tabs on my Reviews. But lets get to the point shall we? \r\nOver the past few years the Gundam series has gone through a lot of riticule by many American's and has totally lost its market here making nearly impossible to even know of the franchise. Bandai's last attempt to make Gundam popular among American viewers was Gundam Seed which epically failed, and was placed in the 4 am death spot on Cartoon Network. Even though GundamSeed Destiny, sequel to Gundam Seed, won best anime of the year 2004 in Japan the series didn't do so good because it was basically Fan service and &quot;Many&quot; Gundam Fans were disappointed by the fact that there were more Hentai then Side Stories of the series. In other words BANDAI milked the crap out of Seed for all its worth. \\n\\n\r\nFew years later a new Gundam series was made to replace Gundam Seed, this series was, of course, Gundam 00. Yes, this series was intentionally delayed in order to make a new Model Market. But all in all the series wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I've watched many Gundam Series and have seen the progress they've made through the years. Gundam 00 is basically a hybrid of many old concepts mixed with thoughts of many modern day techno realism. Yes, I just made up a new term- Techno Realism. The term means technology that will possibly be invented. \\n\\n\r\n25 episodes is quite surpising for most Gundam series. The shortest Gundam series was Gundam 0080 War in the Pocket which had 6 episodes. Gundam 00 wasn't the shortest series but it was able to sum everything quickly and yet very understandable. Usually something like this would take the average 50 episodes and then a sequel would have to be made to finish the project, but no, they actually did good.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of the story are of course young adults who have their struggles and for the most part look like Bishi boys. They aren't really aren't Emo or uncontrolable as many other Gundam characters and have much more of a sense of responsiblity. Their backgrounds are interesting stories within themselves, making you more connected to them. Unfortunatly there is a downside to this, characters that get to involved with their past tend to stray off from their first impression. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is very well thought up and looks like it took much time to think up. How the world looks like in this Gundamverse makes you question if our future would be like that as well. Many politics are involved which many modern Gundam shows were lacking. \\n\\n\r\nMecha designs were simply superb. They aren't as wymsical as the suits in Gundam Seed or as in Gundam Wing but this sense of common technology is what brings me in. I kinda have a taste for generic looking Mobile suits, the ones with rough detail. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end of it all Gundam 00 didn't disappoint me, but it didn't make me overjoyed either. Sure the show is good, but you can't help but feel that eventually things will go wrong and fan service will ruin it all. So far in my opinion Gundam 00 is way better then Gundam Seed/Destiny, and Gundam Wing. But it hasn't reached the greatness of Tomino's original works such as Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta, Char's Counter Attack, and Turn A. All there is to do now is wait until the second season comes out, won't we. Until then I leave the first season with this review.",

            "content": "Well, it\u2019s a new Gundam series, and as a lot of you know, I am a hardcore Gundam fan. Was I excited for this? To be honest, after the bad taste SEED Destiny left in my mouth, I really had little to no expectations of this series. Even with Mizushima Seiji who directed the first FMA series directing this series. There have been more than 20 Gundam series now and what else can the franchise offer with a new series? I know it\u2019s drastically demanding asking for originality, but I did come to terms with that as I got more into this series. Though itmay not offer my unrealistic dreams of originality, I still feel it does have its own unique distinction in its own ways. \\n\\n\r\nTo start off, I was very surprised that this series makes direct reference to current events that are even still going on during its broadcast and during the time of this review, such as the conflicts in Sri Lanka and Ireland. Usually, they use the fictional factions in other series to be a metaphor for other real life conflicts but this takes the cake. Take for example, the first Gundam series was a metaphor for World War II, and SEED and SEED Destiny were a metaphor of a post 9/11 world though those series\u2019 don\u2019t directly reference those events like 00 does. \\n\\n\r\nWhat also captivates me are the sub-plots that involve Princess Marina, and two civilians named Saji and Louise. Princess Marina shows the difficulties of a nation like hers in today\u2019s political climate, and I like how Saji and Louise give a civilian point of view of the war. At first, I really didn\u2019t care for them, but even though they weren\u2019t directly part of the main plot, the series still effectively develops them in a manner in which it drives you to care for them and relate to them.  But besides, this interesting external supporting cast, the main cast is all pretty much characters that have been done before in other Gundam series, but their individual backgrounds are unique and that was enough for me to find interest in them. Initially in these kinds of series, the individual personalities will conflict with one another, and is the series progresses they come to unite. The formula pretty much follows the standard of a Gundam series, but some of its elements are pretty interesting.  \\n\\n\r\nMy main gripe with the series in which people are going to equally agree and disagree with me on is that it\u2019s a 25 episode series. And to be honest, I\u2019m not fond of anime TV series that is 25 episodes or less. The fact that it\u2019s 25 episodes really rushes the last third of the series, especially the ending, and things just come out of nowhere with little to no set up. And I feel with the series having the organization fight 3 super powers at once, it just doesn\u2019t work in my opinion. I know this was made with the intention of a follow up, but I still feel that it\u2019s no excuse to not develop and establish certain things here and there. Yes, there is a second season, but if you seen this series, you get some idea of what I\u2019m talking about. Even with that intent, that\u2019s no excuse to rush and force things when I think there was time to establish and develop those elements. Could that have been done better with 15-25 more episodes? Well, with other Gundam series without counting SEED Destiny, a 35-50 episode season could have really helped this series a lot with what needed to be established and developed with what was exclusive in this series, other wise, you could potentially end up with a cluster fuck like SEED Destiny. But with Mizushima, I think it would have been a series I could have scored a 10/10 for story and characters, but instead, I\u2019m giving it in the 8 range. \\n\\n\r\nWell, the design and the gimmicks for the Gundams presented have already been done before, but there will be some goodies and surprises that will probably satisfy you. If you liked Gundam Wing and/or X, then I feel stylistically, you\u2019re really going to enjoy it. Even though what is artistically presented has been seen for the most part, the coloring, rendering, and the angles are still something fresh. But I feel what makes up for this is the presentation of the action. Thankfully, the animation isn\u2019t abusively recycled like in the cosmic era Gundam series which is a start. But what makes the animation so awesome, I just felt the angles and the smooth frame rate makes the action very intense, very easy to follow and watch which makes it so exciting, simple as that. \\n\\n\r\nThe action from the Gundams can get over kill in which Gundam Wing paved way for, but eventually the action will develop that it will be more about piloting skills and strategy, as opposed to abusing the God like features. The enemy mech designs are pretty primitive looking, but have a different kind of realism to it not offered in other Gundam series. The advanced nations have agile looking mobile suits, and the poorer nations have mobile suits that are portrayed to feel like the Kitty Hawk in comparison. So I thought that was an interesting touch to show that gap in technology. \\n\\n\r\nThe character design is at least more diverse, but the men still look like women. If it weren\u2019t for the voices, I swear they would be women, especially Tieria who looks like Sailor Saturn with glasses. But being the first Gundam to be in HD, it truly delivers. The CG is awesome, and if you\u2019re looking for action, I feel you\u2019ve come to the right anime series. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I found surprising is that once again Miyano Mamoru and Brad Swale once again voice the same character. Previously they voiced Light Yagami in DeathNote, but this time, they both get to voice Setsuna, the main character of this series. And I\u2019ll admit, I was more impressed with Brad Swale\u2019s acting in comparison to Miyano Mamoru\u2019s. Usually you hear Brad Swale with that distinctive high pitched voice, but hearing him with that lower pitch voice that is reminiscent of Mark Hildreth\u2019s portrayal of Heero Yuy just took me by surprise by the balls. I felt this role gave Swale the opportunity to show how versatile he truly is. The rest of the voice cast in both English and Japanese is top notch and I really can\u2019t complain. I\u2019m not going to go into further detail due to time restraints but I do feel I need to point this out. In the English version, I felt I heard Scott McNeil\u2019s voice like 8 times per episode with a random character, and in the Japanese version I felt I heard Ishizuka Unshou\u2019s. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s me, but I felt I heard those voices a lot. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is top notch and I have nothing but praise for it. Who could go wrong with L\u2019arc~en~ciel doing the opening theme? That\u2019s pretty epic. But asides from the fact that it\u2019s l\u2019arc, I felt the tone and the lyrics of the song truly reflected the dark but yet hopeful atmosphere of the series. As for the second opening theme, Ash Like Snow, how many of you know that the singer, Tomoko Kawase, also sang Lonley is Gorgeous the theme to Paradise Kiss? Interesting distinct styles there, huh? The general background music in itself just all fits together and reflects the mood and environment.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I felt that this is a good series, but could have been better if it weren\u2019t for its limitations of being a 25 episode series. I feel with a Gundam TV series, even with an intended sequel, 25 episodes just doesn\u2019t work, and the ending to this series is proof of that. Other than that, I recommend this to just about any fan whether noob or veteran to Gundam if interested. If you want to get into Gundam and would like this to be your introduction to the franchise, give it a shot at your own pleasure. I feel with the animation techniques offered, you\u2019re going to enjoy the action and the music will keep you pumping.  \\n",

            "content": "Note: This review is for the first 25 episodes ONLY (season 1).\r\nGundam 00 one of the many non-Universal Century story series in the Gundam franchise and one that stands out primarily for its initial plot, that being an almost exact copy of the 90s series Gundam Wing: a team of young men are sent to earth in super overpowered mech suits called Gundams with the sole task of bringing peace to the world by whatever means needed. What separates 00 from the campy, cheesy melodrama of Wing though is 00 takes this premise both realistically and seriously and even tries to spin the concept onits head, calling into question the morality of the actions of the main characters and their hypocritically violent approach to stopping violence.\\n\\n\r\nThe key word, however, is \"tries\". It does not entirely succeed in the end, for a number of reasons.\\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost are the main characters themselves: the \"Gundam Meisters\", as they are called. While certainly more in depth than Wing's pretty boy heroes, the Meisters are still unfortunately very static characters with predictable, stock personalities for most of the season, and fairly unlikable ones at that. You can tell that the story has SOMETHING in plan for them to deveolop them, humanize them, and make them realize the mistakes of their ways... but it takes entirely too long to get there, and when you do it feels less like natural development and more like a personality shift.\\n\\n\r\nConflating this issue is honestly ALL the other characters from the various Earth factions are just FAR more interesting, be it the American pilot aces looking to avenge their fallen allies, the Russian military commander who constantly devises new plans to stop the Gundams and basically always succeeding until a plot convenience undoes it, the comic relief fake ace European Union who somehow always manages to survive death by sheer luck, or the Middle Eastern mercenaries who just need an excuse of a war to keep fighting. These characters suffer, struggle, and overall are generally just LIKABLE and thus more interesting to follow, but are doomed to play second fiddle to the pretty boys in super robots.\\n\\n\r\nBesides all this, in the final third of the season, the show introduces three more Gundam pilots with even MORE powerful machines and genuinely unhinged, intolerable personalities. They exist only to commit atrocities that shock even the most jaded of the Meisters, but the issue here is they only serve to be a scapegoat for them: rather than have the Meisters realize their OWN actions are causing more harm than good, they simply have to only observe their darker others do it for them. Its lazy and uninspired, and the fact these three extra Gundam pilots are intolerable hateful characters that are just not fun or interesting to watch they ultimately get killed off without much fanfare and are trivial in the overall scheme of things. This all ultimately leads up to a big unified attack against the Gundams by all the Earth nations at once using their own diet-Gundam machines and a lot of minor characters die, but only the ones on the Meister's side are given much emotional weight despite them being the least interesting of the sides. It just ends on a wet fart.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the plot itself, its... ok. Gundam 00 is heavily dedicated to its setting and world building, an Earth 200 years into the future where solar energy delivered from orbital elevators resolves the energy crisis... but also causes civil wars in formerly wealthy oil rich countries. The exposition scenes are HEAVY here and there are a LOT of names of places and characters to keep up with, and some of the political machinations can come off as overblown and up its own ass, but I enjoyed it for the most part. What is truly good about Gundam 00's narrative is how it plays with its tropes, particularly the struggle of helpless earth weapons against the Gundams. The more the Meisters attack the nations to stop their warring, the more the nations develop better technology for defeating the gundams, including reverse engineering their beam weapons and eventually making Gundam-esque mechs of their own. Seeing actions having these big world consequences is a strong point in Gundam 00's favor, and is a rare sight in most any mecha series.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, to end on a positive note, Gundam 00 has some gorgeous art for a full blown series, and the music is top notch as well, which really draws you into the drama... if you cared for it to begin with. Overall though Gundam 00 is a lackluster experience that plays with some interesting ideas old and new, but is held back by cliche protagonist writing, dense and non-intuitive infodumping, and just some bad storyline choices in the third act.",

            "content": "I'm watching the Gundam series for the 1st time and I started with the original UC 79 Gundam. I went to Gundam 00 2nd because it's the highest rated Gundam on MAL and I'm not impressed. I didn't finish the show but unless it does a 180 I think I get the point.\r\nI think there are 2 main problems with this Gundam: \r\n1 is that it's 100% serious 100% of the time. I love a serious show but there is usually fun mixed in a little bit. This show is so serious that it ends up feeling bland and boring. Even if the comedy isbad it's still charming when a show attempts to be funny. This show has zero charm. \\n\\n\r\n2 is that the main character Setsuna is one of the worst main characters I have ever seen. He's like a Gundam himself, a robot with no emotion. Usually if a character is serious he's badass but this kid is not tough or funny. He has no personality.\\n\\n\r\nDon't let this 8.20 on MAL deceive you there are better Gundam shows than this, the original is better imo. This show may appeal to some people that love politics but it's just not for me. I'm going to move on to other Gundam shows that I think will entertain me far more.",

            "content": "Gundam 00 is not what I expected it to be. \r\nI have only a passing acquaintance with the Gundam franchise. My first encounter with it was Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket, which I'm told is hardly a typical Gundam series (though it is exceptionally good, and one of my favourite anime series). A couple of years ago I watched Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory, which was enjoyable enough but a little forgettable. So I had some slight idea of what Gundam entails, but no detailed knowledge and no experience of alternate universe versions like Gundam Wing. \r\nSo from that point of view, Gundam 00 isnot particuarly Gundam-like. Clearly it has a more modern visual style but it also feels entirely different, and the Gundams themselves serve a completely different function. In many ways there's no reason for it to be a Gundam series at all. The Gundam mobile suits in 00 could just as easily have been an original creation; I can't help thinking that a famous name (and identifiable visual design) was attached to this in order to attract an audience. \\n\\n\r\nFortunately, Gundam 00 is very good regardless. \\n\\n\r\nHaving only recently finished watching the series, the strongest lingering impression about it is moral ambiguity. This is a theme that persisted throughout the whole series, though it did weaken towards the end. The Gundam pilots working for the Celestial Being organisation are narratively the protagonists - they are the characters we spend the most time with and get to know in the most detail. But in many ways they could just as easily be the antagonists: they perform violent missions that could easily be (and frequently are) considered acts of terrorism, knowingly getting civilians killed in the collateral damage. Many of the supporting characters are on the other side of this divide; they are soldiers protecting their homelands from this erratic terrorist threat, or civilians who just happen to get caught up in events larger than themselves. Main character Setsuna F Seiei explains it very well himself when he remarks that it's hard to say who is right because both sides are justified. He's talking about a small civil war, but the sentiment can just as easily be applied to the whole series. Every faction does things that could be considered reprehensible, yet every faction also has good and understandable reasons for its actions. \\n\\n\r\nThere is no black and white in Gundam 00. \\n\\n\r\nThis determination to paint all deeds in shades of grey necessitates quite a large cast for perspective, and with many names and abbreviations to keep track of, sometimes it can become confusing. After 25 episodes I know the Union is based around the US, but I couldn't tell you which out of the other power blocs (the AEU and the Human Reform League) is where. Similarly, I have no idea which of the anti-Gundam commanders is affiliated with which authority. In many ways, the three power blocs that govern most of the world are interchangable. Still, while this makes it hard to follow the political manoeuvring, it also means that you don't really need to. It doesn't really matter which government is which, just that all of them fear and resent Celestial Being. \\n\\n\r\nThe characterisation continues this ambiguity. People do bad things in order to prevent worse things, or they do good things for bad reasons. Because we get the points of view of various characters with different affiliations and agendas, almost all the recurring characters are sympathetic, which leads to an interesting situation where (at least for me) it's impossible to root for one group or person. I wanted Setsuna to win his battles, but at the same time I wanted Graham Aker to win his - and the two of them often come into conflict. It's testament to the quality of the writing that I felt symapthy and support for so many characters with such different personalities and incompatible agendas. \\n\\n\r\nThere is still room for improvement in the characterisation though. I never particularly liked Saji and Louise, the token innocent high schoolers who we follow periodically. Saji is meek and inoffensive, but eventually his inoffensiveness itself becomes annoying. Louise is just an obnoxious brat, and I that felt any woe that befell her was largely deserved - probably not the reaction that was intended. Mercenary captain Ali al-Saachez seemed a bit of a caricature, gurning and snarling his way through his scenes as though in pantomime, though he could have been interesting if we'd learnt more about him. There is also a group of characters introduced halfway through, who never really get any development at all, and as a result come across as quite two dimensional and incidental. I neither supported nor opposed them; they were just there. \\n\\n\r\nStill, these are the exceptions. While no character is explored comprehensively, the main ones do get distinct personalities, and backgrounds that shape them in believable ways. In many anime series, the traumatic pasts of many of these characters would lead to endless bouts of dreary introspection or petulant outbursts, but they're mostly handled with maturity here. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, being a series about giant robots used in war, there are plenty of combat scenes. These are generally well done, though at times it can be hard to tell which mobile suit is which, particularly with the non-Gundam types. These scenes are energetic and well-paced, and they never seem to drag. Nor does the series indulge in the common anime practice of abusing action scenes; not once did I feel a particular confrontation had been crowbarred in just to keep the action content high. \\n\\n\r\nI think it's worth noting that, as I mentioned earlier, some of the series' qualities trail off in the final few episodes. The shades of grey become more clearly defined and we start to see some elements of a black and white/good and evil dichotomy appearing, but the troubled characters largely keep things on track. We also get the odd deus ex machina popping up as time goes on, but still far less than in many series. Combat understandably becomes more frequent as the series approaches its conclusion, but fortunately it remains fast-paced and compact. On top of this, the gradual development in the way the war is waged lends each action scene an additional draw. With each new battle I was eager to see how the military would attempt to counter the Gundams, and how far they would be able to succeed this time. \\n\\n\r\nCrucially, at no point does the series become a chore to watch. Even in its weaker moments it's still a high quality series, and aside from one reasonably short recap montage halfway through it never feels padded or slips into filler, nor does it wander off into rambling asides. The writing remains tight and focused, and ensures the series is an engaging watch to the very end. \\n\\n\r\nGundam 00 Second Season will pick up the story four years later, but I still have that ahead of me. Perhaps some of the weaknesses I mentioned in this series, particularly some under-developed characters, will be addressed there. Regardless, Gundam 00 is a series that is definitely worth watching. Gundam fans should be prepared for this bearing very little resemblance to traditional Gundam (at least the main/UC continuity), but it doesn't suffer for that. With plenty of action that doesn't outstay its welcome, troubled characters who don't overdo it, and a delightful moral ambiguity that makes a refreshing change from black and white conflicts, Gundam 00 is a well written series that should appeal to a broader audience than just mecha fans. Give it a try; it probably has something you'll like.",

            "content": "Sometimes you shouldn't complicate simplicity.\r\nGundam 00 is a peculiar installment in its franchise. Being an introduction into the Gundam franchise for many a fan, myself included, it has arguably become the most popularly viewed entry besides Wing. One could say that the writers looked at Wing and decided to take some of the base elements of it to create their own story that touched on war-related issues of the current times. Then that same person could say that they probably should have followed Wing just a little more loosely given how convoluted and nonsensical circumstances regarding the main group became.\r\nA group known as \u201cCelestial Being\u201dhas appeared in the distant future with one simple objective: fight to bring peace and end all war. Many factions across the globe disagree with their objective which seems aggressively contrary to their methods. Four young adult pilots, half of whom have been affected by war, are deployed by Celestial Being to stop disputes with force, relying on what Gundam fans have referred to as the \u201coverkill formula\u201d, in which single machines mow down dozens of mooks at a time. Sounds relatively simple enough as long as the show manages to highlight and keep track of the multiple factions. The idea comes with the potential to explore all sorts of concepts related to war, terrorism, protests, and global violence in ways unique to the timeline, while slowly peeling the layers of each major combatant. To an extent, 00 seems to capitalize on this potential, even showing a more personal example of what happens to civilians caught in the crossfires of battle. \\n\\n\r\nThen we get the robot equivalent to Dragon Ball Z\u2019s Kai-o-ken, an extra private faction that hijacks a poorly explained supercomputer the main protagonists\u2019 faction was using, a council that oversees all of this, even more private investors with their own agendas that get killed off unceremoniously, special particle beams that prevent healing, a myriad of poorly-conceived world-building mechanics that get dropped after what little exploration they had such as the space colonies, a badly done newtype-esque type attribute known as quantum brain-waves, and the knowledge that the series has dropped the ball in making sure we are able to keep up with every private faction. This isn\u2019t even going into the cloning, the innovade/innovator business, Zeta Gundam plagiarism and self-contradictions galore, the increased levels of over-complication in regards to the quantum brain wave mechanic that defines the timeline from the moment one of the main characters gets affected by it as early as episode 3 of season 1, and superpowers that allow communication with the dead, all of which occur in the second season!\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m sorry, was that overwhelming? Good; now you know what watching the 00 series is like!\\n\\n\r\nOne could argue that this series is best enjoyed without attempting to stretch your mental capacity to house all the convoluted nonsense and mental-gymnastics taken by the second half of season 1 onwards. Thanks to the flashy and well-animated mech battles with loads of colorful particles and explosions, and the sexy character designs that pave the way for many moments of casual semi-nudity without the need for fanservice, I\u2019d agree. The designs of each mech are nowhere near as iconic or memorable as those of most other installments, but they do serve their purpose in seeming like the aggressive war machines they are. The music, while certainly not up to Kenji Kawai\u2019s standard, has some decently memorable tracks that do an acceptable job of complimenting the plethora of fights shown throughout. The opening themes also serve well at getting people excited for each episode, as mediocre and often meaningless as each episode may be. They also represent the state of the show in each half, with the first being more simple and about characters getting to know each other and how things are beginning to play out, and the second being more chaotic and more intense in nature, as the action and overall emotional baggage rack up. Sadly, the ending themes, which do follow this, are less enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nFor anyone hoping the characters would provide much of the enjoyment you would likely obtain from the show, just know this won\u2019t likely be the case. The main 4 are mostly simple enough. Allelujah Haptism and Setsuna F Seiei (get used to these kinds of names) had the potential to be the most interesting in the show, given that the former suffers from split-personality disorder and that the latter, who is the main protagonist, is a more reserved and agitated chap who became a child soldier who grew to display trust and touch issues after being betrayed. They only somewhat capitalize on these personal aspects, more so for Allelujah than Setsuna, as the latter is largely Heero Yui from Wing, but with more baggage. Lockon Stratos is the most easy-going and friendly of the bunch, so many will deem him the most likable, even when the chips are down and he gets angry at his comrades or at terrorists. Contrast this with the initially unlikable and ultimately boring Tieria Erde. The rest of the astronomically large cast was largely tolerable, with very few standouts in positive or negative regards. The few exceptions include the fun and determined Graham Acker, the gloriously evil Ali al Saachez --both of whom are Setsuna\u2019s main rivals--, and a painfully disappointing trio that joins the main 4 in the second half. Few are badly written per se, beyond how the script becomes a joke towards the end, but most of the potential many of these characters had is lost, with the second season doing them no favors. You might enjoy the rest of the crew the main protagonists collaborate with, notably the commander, Sumeragi, but getting attached to the wrong crew member may cost you towards the end. They are likely the best characters in the show, given that they allow for some pleasant and even humorous interactions with the main cast and even each other. \\n\\n\r\nGundam 00 was a potentially captivating series squandered by an unchecked need for complication and drama. As such, its characters feel wasted and its world feels poorly developed and half-baked. You will find fun with the action scenes as well as a few of the side characters and their interactions, but you would want to treat this series as simpler than it actually is, lest you watch it start to be torn apart by the power of expectations and critical thinking. 00 goes downhill from here, so if you wish to start this, just know you\u2019re getting the best of what the timeline has to offer pretty early on.",

            "content": "--- minor / vague spoilers ---\r\nFirstly, if you've seen earlier Gundams (MSG, Zeta G, ZZ) and didn't like the plot in any of them, you probably won't like that of Gundam 00, either. You can still enjoy it if you keep your expectations low, though.\r\nIn the first few episodes, it's suggested that Celestial Being's actions are based on an ulterior motive, and many characters have hidden pasts that are revealed little by little -- and so, based on previous experience, you might expect (hope) Gundam 00 to have a \"strong\" plot. As it turns out, it becomes much weaker as the series progresses. The eventsbecome more and more isolated (they either don't contribute to the big picture or they change it in an illogical way) and mainly seem to serve the purpose of suddenly making the action scenes more 'exciting' or suddenly creating a sense of 'tragedy'. Many plot details end up being irrelevant to the big picture, and on the other hand many plot twists are brought about by a deus ex machina.  The final episodes are almost pure action, and the plot becomes a complete mess as it hurriedly tries to tie up loose ends (or again, make the action more 'exciting' or the plot more 'tragic').\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is varied and starts out pretty interesting, but most of it hardly receives any development (at least in the first season). Worse yet, some important (-ish?) characters die before serving much of a purpose.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, as long as you watch it for the action or because you like some character, you should enjoy it --- if you hold high expectations for the story, you'll probably end up getting disappointed like I did.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The only Gundam series that i've  seen before Gundam 00 were Wing and Gundam G way back in the 90's. I am writing this review with the sole purpose of reviewing this anime itself, I won't compare it to any anime or any other Gundam titles because I believe that comparing an anime to any other title will ruin the purpose of reviewing only the anime wholeheartedly.\r\nStory \r\n- Gundam 00's story focuses on the paramilitary group \"Celestial Being\" with the vast dream-like mission of eradicating wars by means of military force using the mobile suits called Gundams. Gundam 00 holds a story filled withwars, comradery and betrayal delivered in a chronological manner. There are many flashbacks in this anime and so as the plot twists. Overall the story is somewhat decent and is tiring at the first but will leave an impression to you when you reach halfway of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\n-The animation is unflawed. Everything seems so perfect, from the mecha, character designs, 3D animation, background and special effects. Everything is perfect, although there are some times that the character design on some episodes is somewhat different from the original design, but it is nothing to fret about because these errors are miniscule. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n-Kenji Kawai is the one whos responsible for the sound and as expected from him, the BGM's were great. The effects (explosions etc) were impressive as well. The OP and ED themes of this anime stands out for they were performed by artists with big names like L'Arc~en~Ciel and the brilliant green.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n-The character development is remarkably slow and leaves you open for the next season. There are a lot of characters that you will like, and inevitably there are also some characters that you will also hate the most.  Maybe everything in the second season will lighten things up in this category. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n-I enjoyed this anime and loved it for the animation is top class. The battles were amazing. There are also some unlikeable deaths but is delivered exquisitely, probably some of the best deaths ever XD. If you're a mecha fan, you'll definitely love this anime, and if you're not a fan of mecha, maybe this is the right time for you to start watching mecha and lucky you, you'll get to start with a good one like Gundam 00.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8.5\\n\r\nThe main factor why I liked Gundam 00 is the animation. Even though the plot is somewhat generic, the plot twists are there to compensate for it. Overall, this anime is decent and the animation is worth looking for. I don't know about you but I can't wait for October to come.",

To rid the world of war they need to start one up.\r\nArt: Well this is Sunrise so they always try tomake it look the best it possible can.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music was very good well the few times you could here it as most of the time it is being drowned out by laser shots.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I like the way the characters are all from different regions of the world e.g. Lockon is Irish (^_^) and Setsuna is a Kurd. They are also very successful in the fact you do create a bond with each of the characters and even empathise with them (I am Irish and I often here on the news of terrorism)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a series that you must not miss unless you aren't a mecha fan as it is a Gundam series'.\\n",

            "content": "Gundam has been described by some as a hard franchise to get into. Honestly, I don't see it. There are multiple series in the franchise, and all of them can be enjoyed on their own. Then again, maybe that's the issue: There are just too many possible gateway Gundam series, and there are some that are more reliant on Mythology Gags than others. So instead, I'll review the show that was my introduction to Gundam, and one of the biggest recommendations for newcomers by various members of the fanbase: Mobile Suit Gundam 00 (Pronounced Double-Oh). So, let's not waste anymore time and see what thisshow is like.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nPart of the reason this show is so accessible is at least partly due to the setting. Division of nations aside, its very similar to te real world all things considered. In turn, this is probably one of the most realistic Gundam series, not necessarily the darkest, mind you (Zeta and Victory are far darker), but multiple real world issues are brought up, from lack of funds to terrorism to even the effect said terrorism can have on the ordinary civilians.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that's good is the pacing, after the roller coaster of the SEED series, the show appropriately slows down, but only so much, as the show in general is relatively fast paced, which gives the show a feeling of danger and urgency. That said, the pacing can sometimes be a bit too fast, to the point it's hard to keep up.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I did like is the general idea of Celestial Being. They're basically what the Three Ships Alliance tried to be in SEED and Destiny, except they don't sugarcoat anything: If The militaries don't stop fighting, they'll start wrecking their stuff (Well, except for civilians, they're safe... mostly). The show overall puts some ambiguity on whether this is right or no, though by the end the answer seems to lean towards the fact that it's not.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing I don't like about this Season, it's the comedy. It's not that the show isn't funny, because it is, but there's just too much of it. Often, they break the mood of a scene and leave a feeling of overall emptiness.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis show has often be called a spiritual successor to Gundam Wing, and you can tell that with the four leads. Setsuna is Heero, Lockon is Duo, Allelujah is a mix of Trowa and Quatre and Tieria is Wufei. What makes them different is their development. Setsuna eventually accepting that there are other ways to help the world, Lockon slowly falling into a path of vengeance, Allelujah.... doesn't get to do much, really, and Tieria eventually undergoing a full emotional breakdown. They're definitely an interesting bunch, and I quite like them.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the side cast helps. Sumeragi is a great commanding officer (Even if she gets drunk a bit too often), Feldt is appropriate antisocial yet also understandably so (And yes, I do ship her with Setsuna) and a few more. The characters of Saji and Louise also do a great job at grounding the whole cast, showing a different perspective that you don't normally see in these shows. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the villains, for the most part I quite like them. Mostly because, when you get right down to it, they aren't really villains at all. Most of them are relatively decent people with their own relationships and goals. The father-daughter relationship between Sergei and Soma being a particular highlight. And of course there's Ali-Al Sanchez, who's a complete nutcase and I love him for that.\\n\\n\r\nMy only issue with the cast is the main villains. Team trinity is frankly generic, and their boss Alejandro Corner isn't much better. They're about as middle of the road as Gundam villains could possibly be.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nEven to this day this show looks great. The movement as a whole is really fluid, and next to no stock footage is used. The fights are also some of the best in Gundam history, being extremely fast paced and generally exhilarating.\\n\\n\r\nThe Mecha:\\n\\n\r\nI... didn't care much for them. The Thrones are cool, I guess, and I love the Gundam Exia, definitely one of my favorites in the franchise. The rest however I couldn't care less for, with the exception for the Naddleh, mostly due to how over the top it is.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is great. It mostly goes for a full on orchestra, which gives the whole show an epic feeling, with the Trans-Am theme in particular being a massive highlight. As for the Openings, while I loved \"Daybreak's Bell\", I didn't care much for \"Ash Like Snow\". And as for te endings, I didn't care much for them either.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is great. Miyano Mamoru had already established himself as a great actor through shows like Death Note, yet this was the show that propelled him into one of the best in the business. The show also deserves credit for being the big break for Hamada Kenji, Nakamura Yuuichi and Kamiya Hiroshi, all of whom did a great job.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast did a great job too. Just to mention a few, we have Saito Chiwa, Yoshino Hiroyuki, Kugimiya Rie, Miki Shinichiro, Neya Michiko and even the Late Great Otsuka Chikao. Overall, 00'a got a pretty damn great cast.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI hope you can see why 00 made me a Gundam fan. While the show isn't flawless, I do feel that it's a well told war story with many interesting themes and good ideas all around. I highly recommend you give this show a chance, as it truly is one of the best.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

            "content": "My first Gundam series was SEED, and then Destiny.  Compared to both of these, Gundam 00 (pron: Double O, as in Double-O Seven), is exquisite, and a very welcome addition to the franchise.  Of course, like all the Gundam series, and mecha anime in general, there are a few pitfalls like repetitive stories and whiny characters.\r\nThis anime also follows the \"gundam vs. the rest\" recipe but I got hooked on to the series early on because the plot seemed to rely more on suspense and political intrigue, a sort of Death Note mecha anime, if you will.  However, like it's predecessors, thedeus ex machina element soon became overbearingly strong.  The script-writers did very well to balance the equation towards the end and set the scenario for the second season.  I think the promise of a second made the production house slack off a bit...\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is exquisite.  The Gundam designs are simply sublime, there's a sense of clarity in the artwork and the results are a visual treat.  I think the Gundam designs in this anime is the best in the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nSound, especially, electronic jam pieces played during battle sequences has always been a trademark of the Gundam franchise and 00 does not disappoint on that front.  Although the music is not memorable, it works well with the animation and the story.  The overall effect is rather good.\\n\\n\r\nThe pitfall of mecha animes ~ whiny pilots.  Like the other products in the Gundam franchise (barring Gundam Wing), 00 also suffers from a cast comprising  morally dysfunctional and confused pubescents.  It wouldn't be so bad if I didn't have to listen to the pilots' rambling bitching about not understanding what the f*** is going on and questioning the meaning of life, universe, and everything else.  It's 42 damn it!  Barring the pilots, the supporting characters are great... at times.  Then there are people, simply there to bring a personal aspect to the pain war and violence causes.  Perhaps the second season will expound on some of the characters as there are several unanswered questions.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this.  The &quot;game of chess&quot; approach to the plot, the brilliant battle sequences, the sort of real world setting, and the quick pace of the series made it very worthwhile and I happily await a second season... although I am a little unsure if a second season was necessary.  You will understand what I mean if you watch it.  Let me know if you agree or disagree.",

            "content": "If I were to rate this like a hollywood film, I'd say it's a popcorn action movie.\r\nIt stands as an interesting followup to the Gundam Seed premise (the plots are in no way or form linked) and as a solid stand-alone work.  It explores more fully the ideas expressed in the last two Gundam series, the idea of fighting to end war.\r\nStory: Doesn't really add many twists to say the least.  \r\nA little background on the world in this series.  It's the first Gundam series that takes place in the AD time continuum, the beginning of the 24th century.  The majorityof the world is grouped into 3 factions, all of which hog a share of the only remaining energy resource which is solar energy being \"farmed\" from massive sollar arrays ringing around the planet.  Despite free and renewable energy, wars continue based on who has the energy, and more traditional reasons like religion.\\n\r\nThe story starts out and the organization Celestial Being, with it's 4 pilots called \"Gundam Meisters\", begin operations to end war.  They do this by sending the ridiculously overpowered Gundams to destroy any forces involved in conflict.  They enjoy enormous success at first despite the four Meisters all possessing massive character flaws and/or traumatic pasts.  In typical Gundam story-telling the team of heroes is betrayed and they lose their technological edge.  There are a lot of small plot twists and many of the seemingly stray plotlines converge in the second series.  The whole Saji/Louise subplot finds resolution in the 2nd series so don't be confused by it's rambling nature.\\n\r\nI found the initial reactions of the nations to be logical, but they increasingly become less so and the seemingly jaded opinion of the writers that the public would so quickly reject a vigilante military organization is a touch out there.\\n\r\nI could explain it further, but I'll leave that to the people who choose to view this show.  I thought it worked but had some logic gaps, as most Gundam series do since they are typically aimed at the teenage male bracket.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  The different designs were very well done and a pleasant change from the generic designs of SEED.  Nothing wowed me, but you can tell the characters apart and they do wear more than one outfit (a sign of poor art standards if they only wear one; see April O'Neil in TMNT and think body odor).\\n\\n\r\nSound:  The soundtrack always fit the mood, the openings are great.  I'd add either of the openings to my MP3. list, though the endings were pretty bland.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Setsuna is the most boring main character ever.  His motivations are clear, his \"monk in a monastery\" attitude towards female interaction are severe even by the celibate Shonen anime standards.  He appears to be in his mid-teens, acts much older of course in that he never seems to let loose or even smile.  His tortured past in being manipulated by radical muslim extremists is interesting, but barely seems to add or subtract to his personality.  It is interesting that he's probably the first Kurdish hero of any anime.\\n\r\nLockon Stratos is the likeable, older brother of the group.  Of Irish descent, his family (except his twin brother) were killed by the same extremists that Setsuna once belonged to.  He's the most relatable of the 4 meisters.\\n\r\nAllejuah Haptism is a young man (turns 21 at the beginning) with his normal personality and then his psychotic alter ego Hallejuah.  He was formerly \"Super Soldier\" test subject who managed to escape the program.  He has a strange mental link with the other Super Soldier, Soma Pieres, who is involved in the HRL (one of the nations) efforts to capture a Gundam.\\n\r\nLast of the Meisters is Tierria Erde.  His background is not explained much in the first series, but he is able to link directly with the group's super computer \"Veda\".  He's not entirely human and doesn't want the others to know this.  He's also the \"jerk\" of the group until he confronts his own shortcomings and is not rejected by the others.\\n\r\nThere are many other characters, most of whom are interesting in their own ways.  The one other character who's (in my opinion) worth noting in this review is the tactician or \"tactical forcaster\" for Celestial Being, Sumeragi Noriega.  She is very reminscient of Misato from Evangelion.  She drinks frequently and wears skimpy clothes on occasion, but is all business during combat operations.  She's haunted by a terrible accident early in her military career that resulted in a massively fatal friendly fire incident.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It's perhaps the thin plot and simplistic characters that make this show such a fun watch.  Especially at the beginning, anyone watching could seem themselves wanting to join Celestial Being.  Fighting to end the countless \"brushfire\" wars across the globe with weapons and machinery that far outpaces anything in use at the time.  That quickly ends, as some of the hallmarks of any Gundam series are warmongers, conspiracies, and the fact that the Gundams are always fallible in some way.  You are always rooting for Celestial Being, though for some reason everyone in the anime seems to hate them for their \"hypocrisy\" (still think it's flimsy\".  The other constant in the series that whenever it seems that the Gundams are finished, they always get a new ability or specialty that tips the odds.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  I like this series, plain and simple.  I watched the first season(shown on Sci Fi channel in the US) and wait eagerly to watch the new episodes (second season) online each Sunday (currently waiting for the dubbing of the final episode).  It doesn't have great characters like Code Geass, Naruto, or Rurouni Kenshin; but each are interesting and memorable in their own ways.  The plot is annoyingly simple, but you still are on the edge of your seat.\\n\r\nThe one thing that I can say that REALLY puts this anime far apart from most others is that the action keeps going.  Rather than have all the character development happen in between the fighting, most of it occurs mid combat and I don't think there is a single episode where at least some sort of skirmish is going on.\\n\r\nSo I recommend this movie to anyone who wants an engrossing anime, with loads of actions, and doesn't want their morals or beliefs challenged.\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a character driven anime (see Death Note), a mecha as metaphorical experience (Evangelion), or light-hearted adventure (Naruto) then I wouldn't recommend it.",

            "content": "This series has many fantastic aspects, however it also has many terrible aspects. I do not even know where to start. I might as well start from the beginning.\r\nOne of the best episodes of the series is definitely the first, in which the Gundams come out of now where and kick some ass. From the beginning, however, we see was ultimately brings this series down: the gimmicks. The GM drives are just a gimmicky plot device, the solar energy system (even though it is pretty cool) seems very silly, and there are other things that leak through. There seems to be to much that thecharacters have to just accept - the series becomes busy. It is very much like Gundam Wing and lacks the \"real robot\" aspect that is the original Gundam. Most Gundam series that fall out of the Universal Century cannot measure up.\\n\\n\r\nOnce you have watched the Mobile Suit Gundam and Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, other series do not quit measure up. Gundam 00 is no exception.\\n\\n\r\nThe interesting things about this series is the politics. I liked how very real this series was in terms out how the nations operated and the political decisions involved in dealing with the Gundams. Unfortunately, this gets drowned out by the \"Gundam Meisters.\" They are called MEISTERS which is just extremely pretentious and lame. This exemplifies the snotty philosophy and ideas that go through out the series. It attempts to be deep but fails.\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting characters are the minor ones and are ignored. The main characters have interesting aspects to them, but they tend to be pushed aside. \\n\\n\r\nThe mechanical designs are very creative. Yet, lack any practicality and can be ridiculous at times. I do enjoy the Union Flags. The character designs are okay. I love Tieria, however I feel that they could have become more Military-esque. The fight scenes are well done and advanced.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire story is run by a \"plan\" which, in my opinion, is completely far fetched. It relies on too many things, and is just unrealistic.\\n\\n\r\nThere are 3 things which I give this series a pat on the back for: Alejandro Corner, Saji and Louise, and Ribbons at the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season is much better than the second, which I will also write one, which my full criticism will be.",

            "content": "When you think gundam, you think of people piloting cool mechs and blowing things up right? I'm not going to lie to you, that aspect is alive and well, but Gundam 00 is so much more than that. \r\nThe series starts out with gundams being gundams and sliding around tearing the world a new one. While you're paying attention to the action though, the characters are developed into real people with a legitimate reason to pilot a gundam and try to put an end to all the coflict in the world.\r\nsurprisingly my favorite parts of the anime were the parts that dealt the least withthe gundams. I liked the civilian characters the most because they brought the effects of war into the light and you could relate to the way they felt. There were relateable thoughts like &quot;the war doesn't effect me&quot; or something like &quot;why is this happening to me? I have nothing to do with these battles!&quot;\\n\\n\r\nAt the end, when everything is approaching the climax and everything is laid on the line, you can feel the fervent emotions of the gundam pilots. As the characters approach their limits mentally, physically and emotionally you feel their efforts pull at your heartstrings. I'm not ashamed to admit that i cried at the end.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, you may be wondering why i gave the character an 6 if i loved the anime so much. Well, the thing is, throughout the anime there are 3 world powers and there are the soldiers and mobile suits of each side joining in the battle. So at first i was COMPLETELY at a loss to which world power the one character was assigned to or which world power used which type of mobile suit.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end all of that confusion is overrided because he characters that really matter are the gundam pilots and they are undoubtedly part of celestial being.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is accessable to all groups because it has cool mechs blowing each other up for the guys and teary moments for that girls. I hope you enjoy this anime as much as I did.",

            "content": "You'd think Sunrise would be busy creating their much acclaimed Code Geass series, but considering that they've managed to make another Gundam series in between the two, they're probably not\r\nNevertheless, this hasn't retracted much from Gundam 00 in any way at all. Whether you're a die hard fan or a newcomer to the most famous mecha series of all time, you won't be disappointed.\r\nStory\r\nSet in a much more believable future than its predecessors, Gundam 00 builds upon a plot many Full Metal Panic fans are familiar with. An organization that attempts to enforce peace by intervening in all military conflicts. Right, 'nuff said. Since FMPalready capitalized on this years ago. Gundam 00 loses points on originality.\\n\r\nHowever, that's no reason to be deterred, because the series still manages to tell an impressively organized story. Much of the plot jumps around, because of the wealth of characters involved, but all the individual stories of the various factions managed to weave around each other seamlessly.\\n\r\nThe downside to this is that sometimes, you may feel that particular episodes focus too much on characters you don't really want to see. (It does happen).\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nOh wow, new technology has been kind to Sunrise studios. Many think that once you've seen one Gundam, you've seen them all. Well, think again. The mechas in Gundam 00 look much more flashier and cleaner than ever before. Kudos to Sunrise for the animation as well. It's hard to tell if a sequence is being repeated, and everything comes together smoothly.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nVoice acting, special effects, and BGMs. All perfectly done. Or at least as close to perfect as possible. On the subject of the themes, I don't know about anyone else, but I've added every single opening/closing from Gundam 00 to my music library. The songs fit the series perfectly with their uplifting and vibrant beats that also hint at certain dark elements in the plot.\\n\r\nJust to put this into perspective, this is coming from a guy who's gotten a C or worse in every music class he's ever been in... just so you know.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe most interesting part of Gundam 00 has to be it's character lineup. Like most military anime, the cast can be divided up by the factions they belong to. Using this principle, you get 4 main groups. The members of Celestial Being (of which the Gundam &quot;Meisters&quot; are most identifiable), the AEU (the egotistical ace, Patrick Colasour), the Union (Captain Graham Acre and his flag pilots), and the Human Reformation League (Colonel Sergei Smirnov and his team). Of these 4 groups, Celestial Being is best represented, and the viewers gain insight into their pasts, their personalities, and their secrets. However, the presentation of the three other global military powers leaves something to be desired. Granted, they are supporting/extra characters, but the main thing that irritated me was that I knew nothing about Captain Acre, who probably appears the most out of all the other military supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, I'm missing two other parties, namely the engineering student Saji Crossroad and the Princess of Azadistan, Marina Ismail. These are the civilian characters who are more affected by the war instead of taking part. And this, is the genius of Gundam 00. In addition to watching the progression of the war, the audience is shown the effects. This provides a sense of reality and offers a darker side to the show.\\n\r\nThere are those that will criticize, saying that the civilians weaken the focus on the Gundams, but I personally think they're a fresh breath of air... when Saji's not being generally annoying.\\n\\n\r\nBut why? Why did it get a 6? \\n\\n\r\nBecause of the presentation. The producers must have been at a loss as to how they'd introduce all of their characters at the same time. What followed was a pitiful attempt, where nearly all characters were unveiled on the very first episode with little to no preamble. This created much unwanted confusion as to who was who and what their purpose was. Plus, because there are so many characters, not enough of them get enough screen-time (my previous grievance with Acre). There are so many characters I would love to know more about, but with too little time, it becomes impossible.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nGundam 00 is still amazing. It's fresh, it's new, and the battle scenes are out-of-this-world. You'll love the plot, and the vibrant characters that come with it. Plus, you don't have to feel guilty while watching cus no one's doing any mind-controlling. Yet.\\n\\n\r\nI apologize for any lapses in grammar, spelling, or sanity I may have had while writing this review.",

            "content": "Quick/Dirty Review filled with Run-on sentences. May contain spoilers.\r\nThe story is quite a standard of the Gundam franchise. It begins with the world/world leaders being total dickheads which really need to change. Enter the Gundams, the super weapon which will eradicate all war. That sounds very much like a contradiction, and it is. Unions unite, get taken over, the Gundams get in a pinch...if you've watch Gundam Wing before, then you'll see a lot of the elements here. \r\nYes, the storyline is not original (because you know, this is GUNDAM), but this Gundam is tailored to comment on the problems of society today through thecharacters, through the Gundam pilots (Meisters), their dubious and powerful supporters (Celestial Being, Trinity) and the  who oppose them (Union, HRL, AEU). But what had been a very good move for this series is putting a chunky sub-plot with civilian characters who eventually get caught up in the conflict one way or the other: Saji, Kinue and Louise. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are several characters that this series could have made without. Some of the Ptolemy crew seem to have been made for only two purposes: Fanservice and Drama. Several characters are too underdeveloped, such as Wang Liu Mei, Christina and Lichtendal. Wang Liu Mei's supporting role is flimsy at best; she spends most of her screentime stating observations, asking questions and pasting a flowchart while the audience has been on it. It's great if this is your first Gundam series, but when you have experienced the other Gundam stuff, it becomes frustrating. Christina and Lichtendal have no character momentum, but ended up as drama scapegoats. Some characters are just so unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flop doesn't come from these less used characters, but from Marina Ismail. Her character should have been extremely vital and catalytic, as women of her position ought to be, but she ends up helpless, useless, witless...you know the drill.  Marina SHOULD have been the moral compass of the story or the foil to the Meisters with her balancing act, but she is totally impotent that she becomes annoyingly insignificant despite the screentime. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was very satisfactory. There's a new level of  mobile suit and weapons design. It's not much, but it's better. The art direction was fantastic.  Gundams may be block and big, but thanks to wonderful CG, excellent camera work, satisfactory animation, they are so fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being badly written half the time, Gundam 00 is highly enjoyable. The production know how to alchemize something. The characters are lovable and intriguing, the plot is predictable but not very obvious, the details (graphics and plot-related) are liberal and the animation is very easy on the eyes. Gundam 00  is equal parts cheesy, dramatic, somewhat bloody (+expect mobile suit mutilation) and introspective (sometimes it's a no-brainer, but wattheheck). This is WAR PPL! There's a lot of low points in the first twelve episodes, but half of it pans out in the end. Half of it.\\n\\n\r\nThat's because there's a season 2 that still features the ridiculously entertaining GN drives and GN particles. We never knew what exactly happened to the  Gundams, the pilots and the rest of the Ptolemy. We'll know more about the escalating world conflict (it never ends, ppl), and the necessity of the Gundams (again) in the new era.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you've watched a Gundam series before, this series will not surprise you or totally impress you. If you've watched Gundam Wing, this series may disappoint you or not (they are many similar elements). If you're a Gundam virgin, it's a good introduction to the Gundam Franchise.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Not bad. //Off to watch the second season\\n",

            "content": "Do you know this feeling when you're about to get something new? You become hyped, anxious, sometimes a bit nervous. I personally love this feeling. But the worst part comes when you finally get what you wanted - the hype, the anxiety, nervousness, everything disappears. Sometimes, you're even disappointed...\r\nI felt very similar to this when I first watched Mobile Suit Gundam 00.\r\nI was expecting something huge, flourishing, spectacular and unforgettable. What I got instead hardly reached my expectations and left me with this slight feeling of unfulfilled dream of a 10-year-old boy. No matter that I'm 23.\r\nThe thing about G00 is... that everything seems fine.We have a understandable and catchy story to tell, with memorable characters, some tough decisions and political aspect in the background. We also have some really great dialogues (although second season seems to really suffer from lack of those) and a message to pass on.\\n\r\nThe art is nice, smooth and up-to-date. The music is fitting, well, maybe not epic, but still does it's job splendid, the seiyuu work is also worth mentioning. So all in all, you get a decent piece of Gundam anime. Errr, no.\\n\\n\r\nIf it was a series existing on its own (i.e. no Gundam series in the past) then I would be staggered by all those things mentioned. But unfortunately, it is not. There has been tens of other Gundam shows past these 30 years and I dare to say that most of them did their job much better than 00 does. I will not compare the series to any of its predecessors, I will not spoil anything here. It's not my job. My job, is to tell all of you Gundam fans that this is not what you had in mind and had expected when you first saw a pic of Exia and Setsuna.\\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost - we have seen it all somewhere else, the characters, the mecha design, the motifs, heck even the music is a re-do of some epic volumes I had heard some years ago. Plus, the story, although well thought of gets cliche in the second season which wastes tremendous potential it had during the first instalment. \\n\\n\r\nYou'll enjoy it, that's for sure. But you won't remember the lines from it.\\n\r\nLikewise with Gundam SEED - which is a mediocre G series, but has this something that makes me remember Lacus saying 'What're you fighting for, your father's orders? Or maybe the medals you receive?' or Athrun saying to Shinn 'Try and remember Shinn! What was it that you really wanted? This kind of world? This war?'. And let me tell you this, SEED has more of it. 00 doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's basically it. 00 is a good series, a well descendant of it's well-know predecessors, but for a fan - it has almost nothing. A person who's new in the franchise will love it. I.... liked it? Kinda...?",

I really wanted to like this anime because it sounds badass when I thinkabout it. However, the script, voice acting, and characters drag everything down. A great setting was there, if only it developed a more interesting cast earlier, and the characters figured out how to speak naturally. (End of Conclusion)\\n\\n\r\n         Gundam 00 is, of course, set in the future where the world has access to advance technology, specifically mobile suits. The earth is in a scarce resource scenario, and the nations pool their resources together to create a giant solar panel. Of course, the countries of the world begin fighting each other over control of the energy. This is where the renowned genius, Aeolia Schenberg, comes in. He disappeared a long time ago and formed a plan to rid the earth of war. Thus, the anime begins.\\n\\n\r\n         Schenberg is long dead before his plan is carried out. He creates the Gundams, advanced mobile suits that severely out-tech the standard Flag mobile suits, and forms a group known as Celestial Being. Celestial Being\u2019s role is to intervene wherever there is war. They destroy anybody involved in the battle, and their advanced technology makes them juggernauts against the earth\u2019s forces. By limiting the earth\u2019s ability to go to war with each other, the anime creates an interesting scenario. This is where everything goes all wrong. The anime paints a very interesting setting, and possibly interesting characters. Unfortunately the delivery of it is damaged by almost everything else. \\n\\n\r\n        The characters in the first season are generally bad. I\u2019ll sum of the protagonist in one sentence. \u201cI have no emotion and only know how to fight.\u201d In all seriousness though, he is a war orphan from the Middle East, and has an interesting background. He would have been a good main character, but does not make a good protagonist. Moving on, the rest of the Gundam pilots are somewhat interesting, however, not everything is revealed until the very end of season one and into season two. This really makes watching the first season a struggle.\\n\\n\r\n       The dialogue and voice acting in the English dub is generally bad. I almost want to go back and count how many times a character will repeat what another says in a \u201cMETAL GEAR?!?\u201d form.  It isn\u2019t the most atrocious thing I\u2019ve ever heard (*cough* Pilot Candidate *cough*), but there really isn\u2019t a memorable delivery on anyone\u2019s part. It almost seems downright silly in one episode when the protagonist says \u201cGUNDAM!\u201d about ten times as he fights for his life. Big events that are supposed to evoke a lot of emotion are usually ruined by one horribly delivered line. Combine this with a cast nobody cares about yet and you get quite difficult anime to watch.\\n\\n\r\n      The action is well animated and generally good. Unfortunately, it has a lot to make up for. If you\u2019re looking for action and that\u2019s it, you\u2019ll probably be disappointed. It isn\u2019t bad or anything, but there are not any memorable \u201cGoke vs. Vegeta\u201d fights. The best fights are at the very end (if you can make it that far), and in season two.\\n\\n\r\n      The art style of this anime is probably what I enjoyed the most. All the Gundams look badass, and the main cast of characters have a nice style to their design as well. Everything is well animated, and there really isn\u2019t much to complain about here.\\n\\n\r\n      Overall, Season One of Gundam 00 is mediocre. I really wanted to like this anime because it sounds badass when I think about it. However, the script, voice acting, and characters drag everything down. A great setting was there, if only it developed a more interesting cast earlier, and the characters figured out how to speak naturally.\\n",

            "content": "Readers please keep in mind that I'm writing this strictly on the anime itself. I tend to stay well away from mecha anime, but this has been a sort of introduction into the series for me. So, I think this review would suit people best if this is the first Gundam show they are going to watch.\r\nSummary: Gundam 00 takes place some centuries into the future on the A.D. calender. It takes place within our solar system, but mainly on Earth until the latter episodes of the series kicks in which are all set in space. The world has split into three main powers: theUnion (consisting of North and South American countries), the AEU (consisting of Europe,  the Middle East, I think Africa is part of it too) and HRL (consisting of Asia and Russia). The world exists in a delicate balance as these powers play a zero-sum game where all of their armaments must to limited to ensure that they have no advantage over the other two powers. However, as mentioned before, this is a very delicate balance and if it was broken in anyway, it would cause the entire world to go into a state of chaos (well, eventually anyway). A mysterious group called Celestial Being step in and make a stand by saying that they will intervene in conflict situations and resolve them through violent means to ensure that they don't drag out for long periods of time (since prolonged periods of conflict end up causing more casualties and loss of resources). They use a type of advanced weapon by the name of GUNDAM, which are large humanoid robots that are equipped with various types of armaments and generally cause way more destruction than those of the world currently has. The question is, how will the world react to this? Is it a miracle from the heavens? Or is it a threat to the peace and stability mankind has accomplished so far?\\n\\n\r\nNow for the review,\\n\r\nStory (8/10):\\n\r\nI thought the story had its fair points. Many of the conflict situations are similar to the ones in the world today showing that these things will take time to resolve or get worse if we just leave it as it is. The question that the story first poses is, How should peace be approached? Diplomatically (a slow and generally unsuccessful process that is deemed right in this world) or through 3rd party intervention (fast, generally destructive, but in the long term it saves a good deal of casualties and resources?\\n\r\nThe story took many different viewpoints to convey the tale. It generally took the view of the protagonists, the Gundam Meisters, but occasionally it took the view of the antagonists, the soldiers from the different powers and even of how it affected the civilians.\\n\r\nThe story, however, suffered from unrealistic aspects such as recurring villains, weird foreign policies from some of the nations, and lack of emphasis on certain groups or characters (yeah, I understand this is war with thousands of people, but there were too many characters).\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\r\nThis, I believe, was the first High Definition Video Gundam show produced and I believe that this is one of the best animation and art I've ever seen. Fight scenes are fast, but often done in meticulous detail. There isn't much cutting or skipping involved. You can see Exia's blade grinding through the mobile suits as though it is receiving some realistic resistance, while in most anime it would be depicted as cutting straight through with the slash appearing before the blade. The character design wasn't excellent, but it didn't affect the viewing drastically. Emotions were extremely well portrayed during battles. Facial features contorting in rage was a pretty common one and a well done one too.\\n\r\nThere were only minor problems with the animation, such as the beams from the false solar furnaces, which looked like they were one ugly solid color, but in general it was excellent.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\r\nI don't really give too much stock to voice acting, but in general it wasn't bad. The opening and ending songs chosen for this show were very good, especially the second opening and ending. The soundtrack was mainly varied, having a good combination of energetic, battle music to the quiet themes of the certain characters. Sound effects weren't too shabby either. Explosions and metal clashes sounded almost frighteningly realistic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10):\\n\r\nPossibly the weakest aspect of the show, I'll start with the bad parts of this aspect.\\n\r\nTo begin with, there were too many characters and only 26 episodes to do the job. Yeah, I understand there is a second season, but at least some part of the personality and development should go into this. The ending (a bit of a spoiler here) involved a good deal of minor characters for potentially dramatic scenes, however we could not sympathize for their statement or actions all that much because a very meager about of development had occurred. And finally, a lot of personalities were too similar or just too predictable, but that could be excused since this is anime, after all.\\n\r\nThe good side was that the emphasis was wrought down almost entirely upon the four main characters. They form a sort of dysfunctional family and each of them goes through phases of doubt and distrust before usually emerging becoming closer to each other. They all have their rights and beliefs and no, they aren't pure, altruistic heroes. They are human, even the annoying bishonen dude with purple hair. Our main characters develops immensely and most importantly, asks questions and make statements that are kind of true, despite how much we wish to deny it. This is what makes this anime sort of different from the usual action anime we see. And yeah, someone pulls off a Shinji Ikari style depression before the end, but it isn't as significant as in Evangelion or Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment factor (10/10):\\n\r\nI'll say this, you won't be bored. The action, the occasional drama and even the politics will help you enjoy this anime a lot. However, a few of my friends commented upon the fact that this show recycles a lot of elements from previous Gundam shows and in the end, there isn't a terrible lot of concepts or ideas that are new, so it kind of ruins a surprise element for the veteran Gundam viewer.\\n\\n\r\nPhew, that's about it for now. I'm looking forward to next season, but that's only if Code Geass won't capture my heart once again. Thank you for reading.",

            "content": "Hello there stranger!\r\nI just watched the first Season of Mobile Suit Gundam 00 and I enjoyed it very much. Thus, I decided to write a review to help you out. I did watch Gundam Wing, Gundam Seed and Gundam Seed Destiny too and I am going to include some comparisons to these older show in this review.\r\nI have to admit, I wasn't a big fan of the Gundam franchise until now, but after watching Gundam 00 I was carried away by enthusiasm.  Like the other Gundam shows that I watched, the main theme of Gundam, which is the anti-war theme makes a return. Ithas always been the center of all the shows of the franchise that I personally watched. So lets hit it off with the review shall we?\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\nIf you like political plots with multiple factions you might be in for a treat. The world is split up in 3 factions which cover the whole planet earth. Of course there are conflicts in this world which are resolved by military actions. Every faction fights for its own good, as in past entries of the franchise. \\n\\n\r\nThis is where the paramilitary organization called CELESTIAL BEING (CB) comes into play. It is the mission of CB to rid the earth of all war itself and to achieve this goal they use the secretly developed Gundam Mobile Suits. You can probably tell, getting rid of war by using force sounds silly but the members of CB are all handpicked specialists who accepted CB's vision and want to make it come true. The show starts out slow to introduce the Maincast, CB and the history of the world but eventually picks up the pace. Now, the story itself is rather simple but because of the multitude of factions and characters it might be hard to follow it in the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nAmong the continental factions and CB there are also civilians who take the spotlight. For example the journalist Kinue Crossroad who is trying to uncover the origin of CB. There is also her little brother Saji and his lover Louise who are presenting the civilian perspective of the conflicts to the viewer. I was a little confused at first because they dont necessarily contribute to the main plot but they are a sweet couple that will bring some lighthearted moments and comic relief to the otherwise serious story. Due to the events of the story, the role of comic relief gets passed on to another couple later on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nNow this might be a critical part for some of you. There are over 30 characters featured in this show, thats more characters than episodes. Which is kind of problematic because there is not enough time and exposure to get to know all of them. With each episode running for around 17-18minutes there is simply not enough space to give all of them sufficient screen time. That is also the reason why the show can be confusing at times, because it switches back and forth between the different characters and their associates. When I was halfway through the first season I still didn't remember all the names. I can only assume this stems from the fact that Gundam 00 was laid out to be a 2-season show from the very beginning and the writers decided to introduce some of the characters earlier so the viewer can relate to them in a more natural way when the 2nd season starts. When I look back at the transition from Gundam Seed to Gundam Seed Destiny and compare it to 00, I think they did the right thing because in Seed the new characters from the second season felt kind of forced into the cast.\\n\\n\r\nThere are only 3 characters whose background and motives are sufficiently explored in the first season, and those are:\\n\\n\r\nThe main character with the most exposure, Setsuna F. Seiei, heavily reminded me of Heero Yuy from Gundam Wing. Like Heero he is very young and was trained to handle a gun in his childhood. But Setsuna is very insecure about his doing and develops a relationship with Marina Ismail who very much resembles a different incarnation of Relena Peacecraft from Gundam Wing.\\n\\n\r\nSecond to Setsuna in terms of screen time is another main character Allelujah Haptism, a genetic manipulated super-soldier who developed a split personality as a result of the experiments with his body. He is a very nice and calm person, but in moments of extreme stress on the battlefield  when his life is in danger, his other persona can take over and create an unexpected outcome for the enemy. He reminded me a little of Trowa Barton from Gundam Wing whose personality is similar to Allelujah, except for the alter ego. \\n\\n\r\nThe third character is the sniper of the team, Lockon Stratos. He is the cool guy with the easy-going attitude. He is trying his best to resolve conflicts between the team members  and supports them. He's got everyones back. (which kind of comes naturally as a sniper)\\n\\n\r\nThere are many other characters whose backgrounds are partly explored or at least hinted at. One can hope that the viewer will receive more information about them in the 2nd season. I was still able to relate to them and feel for them because they are all believable characters and nobody is overacting his or her part.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the main villain Alejandro Corner strongly reminded me of Gundam Wings Treize Khushrenada. Both live for war and conflict but Corners motives are much less idealistic than Treize's who believes that that a good duel can bring out the best in a human being where as Alejandro is just craving for power.\\n\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION:\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the best part of the 00 show. Even though Gundam always stood for good animation, the action scenes from Wing and Seed just didn't click with me because they used a lot of scenes multiple times and the battles sometimes felt kinda stale. Its different with 00, the action scenes are superb and on a whole new level. Even now, around 9 years later the animation is very good. The only thing from that time that comes close in terms of animation quality is probably Macross Frontier. (which aired the same year and you should totally watch that too if you are into mecha, romance and music!)\\n\\n\r\nThe new Gundams are also very flashy and have a distinct new look to them that makes them standout in comparion to earlier entries in the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all good looking and cover a variety of different types. There is the boyish Setsuna, the hot and grown up Sumeragi, the cool sunnyboy Lockon, the nice guy Allelujah, the silent and sweet girl Feldt and so on. Whatever you are looking for in character design/type, its probably in the mix too!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nThis might be the worst part of the show. It is not bad by any means but for me it was nothing special either. There are some extremely tearjerking moments underlaid with music that empowers them, which is pretty much the only thing I remember in terms of music. You definitely can't compare the music to, let's say, the space opera that is Macross.\\n\\n\r\nApart from that, the voice acting is very good and the sound in action scenes is always up to par.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT & OVERALL\\n\\n\r\nFor now, this is by far the Gundam show that I enjoyed most in my life. If you haven't been able to get into the Gundam universe just yet, this is the show for you. I wasn't sold on the Gundam franchise until now, but that changed drastically. You might be overwhelmed by the multitude of characters and it might be hard to develop feelings for them, given the little time some of them are exposed to the viewer but the overall presentation is great. There are some theatric moments in the show which are the result of either war, romance or drama. But if you are an Anime or Asian TV/Movie connoisseur, chances are you already know that or you are even expecting it.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I wrote this review, I was asked who my favourite character is and I am still a little unsure. For me there are only two candidates to pick from. Its either Lockon or Allelujah because Setsuna is too much of a wandering stereotype to me. And the winner is...*drums rolling* Lockon! But I hope the female cast gets some more screen time too. >_> I am looking at you Sumeragi and Feldt!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy the show!",

            "content": "If someone says 'mecha', the first thing that pops into many people's mind is Mobile Suit Gundam. Its a series that has a revolving cast of characters, alternate realities and a conflict of ideals. Gundam 00 holds true to the formula, but still doesn't quite meet the standards of its predecessors. \r\nThe story of the series can be summarized in the synopsis above, so I'll just dive right into it. The world of 00 is quite well developed, with technological advances in this series seeming to be actually possible in our own world. The world is powered basically by three solar elevators and the Gundamsare also powered by solar reactors. Not a bad concept and very environmentally friendly. Meanwhile, the nations of the world have joined into three distinct blocs, creating a Cold War-esque feeling of tension. In a nutshell, the setting is a great. However, when the organization of the Gundams, Celestial Being, enters the scene, things start to get really interesting...at least at first. The organization was created to stop conflict through fighting (sound familiar?) and is, of course, universally hated by the very people they are trying to protect. As cliche as the premise is, some twists in the story keep it interesting. However, as it goes on, it feels as though Celestial Being's purpose becomes lost in the fray of gunfire and the sounds of 'I am GUNDAM' coming from the protagonist's mouth. The series seems to overstay its welcome a bit, but thankfully the ending is probably one of the most powerful I've ever seen in an anime. ' (7)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is done by the same guys who have done Gundam in the past, so expect great mech design. The character's designs match their personalities but quite a few characters are bland, so their designs reflect that. (8)\\n\\n\r\n00 has  great openings and endings. So much so that it's worth downloading for later enjoyment (the band's name is L'Arc Ciel, I think). The voice acting (I watched the dub) was solid, with the exception of Setsuna, the protagonist. His voice acting isn't bad per se, but since all he seems to say is 'Gundam this' and 'Exia that' and 'Celestial being to you!', he just sounds redundant. The other tracks of the series don't do anything special either. (8)\\n\\n\r\nThe main cast takes a queue from MSG Wing, making the Gundam pilots handsome(?) young men who at first just seem like eye candy. However, the viewers quickly discover that it is actually true for most of the cast. I couldn't really feel for anyone of the CB team and if it weren't for the final episodes, I wouldn't remember any of their names. The villians of the series are much more memorable, with Ali-al-Sachez (a Gauron copy) taking first prize for being an absolute monster. However, I digress. Back to the rest of the faulty characters. People like Saji Crossroad and his sister seemed to be shoe-horned into the series to almost give it a Slice of Life feel. I see they were trying to show the impact of CB on everyday life, but Saji was not a good choice since he never makes any of his scenes enjoyable to watch. As for that one princess from some middle eastern country, she seems like a love interest for Setsuna in the opening, but in reality, she's used simply as a CB poster girl. Its quite sad really and because of that, I don't even remember her name. \\n\\n\r\nNow, as much as I dislike the plainness of most of the characters, there is one man that actually made sense. One man who actually had a great backstory and turned into being one of the most bad@ssed characters in the entire Gundam universe: Lockon Stratos. Unlike his other companions, Lockon has a great origin story, clear and well developed motivations and an a charismatic personality. It's litter wonder Yuri manga are made of him. He basically carried this series on its back for me, as I was commonly thinking 'How's Lockon going to deal with this conflict' or 'why is Lockon doing this'? While he is commonly overshadowed by his other companions, Lockon gets a beautiful, yet sad conclusion at the end of the anime, cementing a permanent place in my heart (no homo). (7)\\n\\n\r\nSince I watched it on Youtube with dubs, I could watch it anywhere. However, since the show seemed to drag, I would watch bursts of episodes then wait for a few weeks, then watch some more. It hits the basics...kinda...It wasn't a waste of time, but a good beginning and great end can't carry a series this long. (6)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it has a great world but cliche premise echoing past G-series, especially MSG Wing, its art is solid, its sound is both great yet a tad redundant, the main cast with the exception of Lockon as well as the rest of CB are one-trick ponies and it drags but has nice accessibility. I don't regret watching this series, but its a bit overrated. If they had better characters, I would forgive many of its other faults, but since only a few stand out, I give this series a 6/10.",

The series opens with an exhibition of the military showing off their newest model to prospective buyers. Their display is interrupted by the arrival of a Gundam who completely destroys the model and in the process, makes the world aware of their organisation known as Celestial Being. This opening sequence gripped me from inception so I was hooked. The action sequences and the dramatic elements were combined efficiently to make the series a successful one.\r\nART 8/10\r\nThe gundams were quitedetailed and reflected the meister\u2019s personality. The general scenery was reminiscent of a futuristic setting which illustrated how advanced the times were and how even further advanced Celestial Being was.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this series was awesome, the opening songs were absolutely fantastic, both of them. I did not pay much attention to the ending songs but they were pretty good too from what I did listen. Even the music in the anime was tasteful.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main protagonists, Setsuna F. Seiei, is the youngest of the Meisters in Celestial Being. His entire existence is devoted to his Gundam and to making a difference in the world with his Gundam. The other Meisters are Lockon Stratos, who is the sensitive guy, Allelujah Haptism who had some personal issues which he was trying to deal with, and Tieria Erde, who appeared to be devoid of any type of human emotion.Then there was princess of Kazakhistan, Marina Ismael did not serve much of a purpose in the series. She was really just a nuisance, not doing anything proactive to progress her country. Then there was Saji and Louise who had their own side story plus all the other characters that made the series quite a success.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis series was action from episode one (1) and continued on as it progressed. Each episode added on to the story and each of the characters developed with each episode. The action sequences were fantastic and you can identify with each of the characters and what they had to deal with. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis first season of Gundamm 00 was excellent, great story, vibrant characters, superb blend of drama and action sequences. I highly recommend this series.\\n",

            "content": "I'm pretty familiar with the mecha genre, but this is my first time watching a Gundam show since I was like 4 years old, back when it was on Cartoon Network at 4pm. I'm just going to dive right in. I refuse to divulge any spoilers, so this will be a safe read.\r\nPerhaps the biggest strength of this show is the characters. There are around 15 major characters, and what makes them all important is that, one way or another, they all have ties to each other, however minor. We follow the forces of Celestial Being (CB), which includes the Gundam Meisters and the supportingcrew. Other characters include the nextdoor neighbor of Setsuna, a Meister. The neighbor's whole family comes along with him, being the innocent civilians observing away from the action. Meanwhile, we follow the princess of Setsuna's home country, and how she struggles with international politics in the face of war and Gundam intervention. She deals with the leaders of the three major nations, all of whom have key leaders that we follow. In one way or another, all of the characters are intertwined.\\n\\n\r\nAnother strength comes from the role CB plays in world affairs. They try to be a truly neutral force, focused on ending all war. However, the motives of each Gundam Meister starts to interfere with their objective, or influence their actions in one way or another. CB are NOT the good guys. They are NOT the bad guys. And in this ephemeral state of morality, that is where the characters' choices truly bear weight. Instead of being guided by right and wrong, we are guided by motivations. And in today's world, the plot runs a little too parallel to our own world's events. The US deploys forces in the Middle East with their own mysterious objectives; sound familiar?\\n\\n\r\nNow for each category. I'll keep it short.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10. Sometimes the story is cheesy. Being called Gundam Meisters in and of itself has led me to roll my eyes with incredulity more than once over the course of the 14 eps that I have watched so far. Besides that, the world that has been built is interesting and holistic. I have yet to find any major plot holes that detract from the main story, other than the Gundams are 200 years old for no real reason (the gundams, not the kids). But the manner in which events transpire are exciting, the pacing is good, and every character has a chance to shine. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10. I chose this because 7/10 is \"good\". That's all. It is good. There are no real amazing backdrops, and character style is pretty standard of an early 2000s anime. Action sequences are fluid, but move some quickly that the CQC can be hard to follow well. My biggest qualm is that a lot of characters look very similar, so it was hard for me to distinguish a few pilots at first, esp when they have their helmets on, and the mask of the helmet obscures their hair color (the main determinant of Allelujah's and Lockon's identities for me). As you get to know the voices, mechs, and characters, this becomes less of an issue.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10. The atmospheric music sets the tone well. Both OPs are really good, but neither of the EDs appealed to me. However, that's usually my own tastes, since I would rather start a new ep than listen to the ED in ~80% of shows. I have been watching the dub because I'm lazy rn, and it has been very good. Setsuna in particular is great; his lines are delivered with a dry discontented tone that fits him well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10. Like I said, they carry the show. Not only the protags, but the villains as well. Some are clearly evil guys, and you'll hate them right off the bat. But some have more to them than meets the eye, and the true motives of some characters may surprise you. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10. Simply put, it's a simple show made for kids, but it delivers on the action and the plot. You root for some characters, you hate others, and it all comes together.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10. I definitely recommend this show if you like mecha, or as an entry level mecha. It is currently the highest ranked full-length Gundam show on MAL, and I see why. While not without weaknesses, none of those hold the show back from grabbing your attention and not letting go.",

            "content": "Well it only took 138 days since starting the first season (eerily enough this was the exact number I had in my head when I was planning this sentence), but Gundam 00 has finally been finished. When watching it and immediately glimpsing its very high production values, it's hard to imagine that the Gundam franchise was actually in a pretty dire place before Gundam 00. The Seed Destiny series came out almost exactly three years ago, but it feels like a generation behind on production levels. Not to mention Seed Destiny is an extremely common pick among those who've seen it for the worst \u201cmain\u201dGundam series ever made. Seed, though wildly successful, was also met with some controversy but not even close to the same amount. Between this a series of short, niche, but warmly received OVAs were produced. Even among these Gundam MS IGLOO was criticized for its heavy use of CG animation and when added to the fact it doesn't focus on Gundams themselves it's another series many people didn't even bother reaching out to.\\n\\n\r\nThis was one of the low points. But Gundam 00 wasn't designed as any sort of savior, it just happened to be the next obligatory Gundam series and it just happened to be one of the best ones. The series begins in 2307 AD (props for not making it two decades away like most sci-fi), and the world is covered by geopolitical animosity and border skirmishes that are certainly informed by real worldwide tensions in response to various Eastern terrorism and nationalism. Center character is Setsuna F. Seiei, a child soldier encouraged to fight for religious causes in the war-torn nation of Krugis, one of Gundam 00's many fictional counterparts to real world locations, in this obvious case the \u201cmiddle east\u201d. Flash forward to modern day and Setsuna is a \u201cGundam Meister\u201d, one of four people piloting a unique new mobile suit type. His organization Celestial Being aims to stop armed conflicts from around the world through violent deterrence: wherever there is a war, Celestial Being will appear and overpower both sides with the superior force of the Gundams.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the world's various armies threatened by Celestial Being won't just take this vigilantism. Disparate worldwide government factions have little choice but to try and band together against their common enemy, and with Celestial Being isolated from all sides you have a tense set up for one of the most innately gripping Gundam premises. Indeed, the simplest way to describe Gundam 00 would be that it's Gundam as in the thriller genre rather than a space drama with concentrated action segments. This makes it most similar to the well-known Gundam Wing series, with a focus on action, a fast-paced and frequently changing narrative, and less of a focus on character relationships or melodrama. Unlike Gundam Wing, however, Gundam 00 is considerably more clever and a significant upgrade in all aspects.\\n\\n\r\nThe four Gundam Meisters and the rest of the small group of Celestial Being may have advanced technology, but they're still in trouble up against the combined strength of the world's militaries and their always improving technology. The series initially indulges in its vigilante fantasy of preventing war through force, as many people have wondered about before, but gets away from that before it gets old. The entire series is utterly fantastic when it comes to creating hot suspenseful action setpieces and scenarios. About each episode follows the construction of plot and character focus in the beginning and then beginning the mission of the day, which is just challenging enough or intriguing in concept that the progression is entertaining on its own for wondering how Celestial Being will overcome the odds or respond.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters in Gundam 00 are generally likable, but there's so many more than what's necessary for the plot that even the main characters can get caught under the weight of the story's fast paced momentum. No one gets enough attention dedicated to them to become any measure of a complex character because with such a large cast scenes have to be routinely swapped in to show where they're acting in the story without much downtime room for them to develop their personality. Changes in characters are linear and obvious, and internal conflict is dealt with quickly in specific scenes and then not carried with that character. In other words, it's all very simple and straightforward characterization. Whether this light approach is preferable to the convoluted existential angst of other series such as Zeta Gundam is up to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nGundam 00 also does a great job of keeping the pacing strong by avoiding dialogue exposition and dropping the viewer right into the series's environment where they'll infer a lot of what they need to know about the world and its technology through context. An immediate example is the crew of Celestial Being constantly referring to the name \u201cVeda\u201d with no one around to just explain who that is. Because why would they? They already know and also know everyone else does. The viewer has appropriate time to figure this out themselves through context because it seems like whoever this Veda is they're not on-screen yet. Then as you keep watching you eventually realize everyone's referring to some computer master system, and then the only remaining question is if Veda has some sort of AI, and it doesn't take much longer to realize that's not a part of it. It's great to see any anime that doesn't rely on redundant, ill-fitting dialogue to explain things that can be inferred logically by the audience. This removes the need for slowing down the plot's pacing to accommodate the often unnecessary explanation.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with Setsuna, the Gundam Meisters are made up of other codenamed pilots. Lockon Statos, Allelujah Haptism, and Tieria Erde join him in battle, and they're call commanded by Celestial Being captain Sumeragi Lee Noriega. Lockon is an instantly understandable type, the least eccentric guy and a cool-headed confident sniper who's understanding of everybody else's emotional problems and reaches out to them. He's practically the role model of the whole series, although he doesn't get that level of credit. Easily the most agreeable person in Gundam 00. Allelujuah is also relatively normal but more reserved, but he has a split psychotic personality. The split personality concept is a fine unique trait, but his alter-ego's insane behavior is typically over-the-top to the point of being downright lame, and they never really resolve the fact that each personality as practically portrayed as its own consciousness, so this split personality gimmick just kind of tapers off. Tieria Erde is the most mysterious member of Celestial Being for several of his unique abilities, and his archetype is that of the cold and logical type who's frustrated by the emotional decisions of the rest of the team. Sumeragi is one of the franchise's best captains in terms of ability, constantly seen giving new commands to the team through the entirety of every mission and almost always being the one behind every winning strategy.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to Setsuna, he's one of the most wooden Gundam protagonists ever. He speaks in short repetitive idiosyncratic phrases a lot of the time and has little personal motivation to fight beyond his own philosophy. There's more than one occasion in the show where the crew will be talking in complete sentences about complex situations and subjects, and then Setsuna will interject with his always deadpan monotone delivery with a line like \u201c...This world... is twisted.\u201d or \u201c...I... am a Gundam...\u201d and instead of everyone looking at him like he has some kind of social disorder for butting into a conversation talking about things that only mean something to him, they give an impression like he just said something profound. His character development is obscured through these odd behaviors that imply complexity that isn't actually there. At the end of the day Setsuna, who joins Celestial Being to stop war through fighting, decides he is a part of Celestial Being to stop war through fighting. Not a very riveting guy, and his past trauma as a child soldier being the cause of his stoic personality is the only interesting thing about him.\\n\\n\r\nOf particular annoyance are the characters which are thoroughly unnecessary and not particularly important to even the actual plot events. Characters like Wang Liu Mei and Hong Long are difficult to care about because they practically operate as living plot devices to just move around and catalyze more directly important characters to act, but they themselves have almost no explored personal stake in the events that unfold. They basically don't need to exist and take screen time away from the characters who do have a personal investment and involvement with what's going on, and the story could easily be rewritten almost exactly as is without them and find new open space to further develop even the shunned main characters. What little moments actually do need a proxy to go around and instigate plot development could have that role filled by the still generously large remaining cast or a one-off character we don't need to dwell on as anyone important, as it eventually turned out Liu Mei and Hong Log weren't anyway.\\n\\n\r\nBut even this implementation isn't as poor as the two worst characters, Saji and Louise. Their main purpose for existing is showing how civilians can get caught up in a war they want no involvement in, but this is such an obvious element of any war story that it doesn't need to be addressed for the sake of it. If you want to take this perspective on and have it be meaningful, you need to really hunker down on  why it's ever done in the first place: to add pathological weight to the conflicts and violence. These characters have to have a genuine heart for the audience to connect with and feel for them. But because Saji and Louise have a completely, unrealistically, cringe-worthy relationship for two grown adults they're impossible to relate to a real environment of loss and death. Saji is a college student in a defined relationship with Louise and has a meltdown over kissing like a 5 year old, and Louise is equally immature with her selfish actions and egging her mother on about Saji as if it's an elementary school girl in her first pretend relationship. They have no chemistry with each other or common interests to allow us to perceive their bond as anything other than superficial, and these embarrassing scenes in season 1 of them screwing around are completely worthless to the ongoing plot and difficult to sit through. On top of this, all of these pointless scenes are to set up empathy (again, they failed at this) for their more direct involvement in season 2. If the grand idea is to spend half of a series's precious time on useless scenes just so bad characters can be more important in the second half, then you can probably take a step back and realize why this idea is just bad all around and that it's not even important for anything.\\n\\n\r\nMany other minor characters don't get in the way of things and are likable enough. Brash idiot pilot Patrick Colasaur is a little funny and entertaining, and his silly outbursts are spread out through his rare short appearances unlike the above mentioned characters to not be bothersome. But it's still a wonder why a character like this ever was given a distinct identity when he ends up doing literally nothing of importance through the entire series. Marina Ismail is another civilian perspective but this time of the middle eastern nations. She's the princess of some country that's divided through  political turmoil and war, and like a nearly 1:1 copy of Relena Peacecraft from Gundam Wing she's a complete pacifist and doesn't understand peace through fighting out of hopes one day everyone in the world will see everything the exact same way she does and won't need to fight. Good luck sister, but that aside Marina is a very milquetoast nice girl who is just pleasant and quiet at all times, and while she isn't offensively annoying like Saji and Louise she adds nearly as little to the show. She connects Setsuna back to his past again, which is good, but they don't actually have any previous relationship and they forge an inexplicable bond that's just as minor. She informs Setsuna's character development (which as covered above almost doesn't exist anyway), but why she has a particular interest in the lifeless Setsuna is a mystery and although she is sometimes another thing for Setsuna to personally fight for (again, why in particular, she is just another civilian?) their relationship doesn't amount to anything and he doesn't willingly pay attention to her. Marina could be written out of the story even easier than some of the above.\\n\\n\r\nBut you would lose Setsuna's connection back to the middle east, right? Not exactly, and that's a good segue into one of the positive aspects of Gundam 00 which is that it has one of the franchise's best casts of antagonists. Frankly, none of them stand out as amazing, but many are entertaining and threatening rather than being dimwitted enemy commanders who aren't even Newtypes. Another good thing is that Gundam 00 has a decent sense of neutrality with both sides which many Gundam series attempt but fail to deliver on thanks to the antagonist side focusing on clearly evil people. In Gundam 00 Celestial Being are arguably not on the right side to begin with due to their tyrannical threat of force towards any dissentation, and naturally many decent people who are easy to root for in their own right oppose them. Graham Baker is one such character, an ace pilot whose confidence in beating the Gundams is called into question after repeated failures due to inferior technology, and his best friend and mechanical engineer Billy Katagiri. On the darker side of things we have Ali Al-Saachez, a sadistic terrorist who loves causing strife for the sake of it and is the very same person who made Setsuna into a soldier. While it's disappointing that this implied former teacher-student relationship is never made into anything in the present as Setsuna and Ali just hate each other, it's nonetheless bringing Setsuna back to his past more directly in a more interesting way than Marina's character accomplishes. There's nothing complicated about Ali's motivations \u2013 he's literally just an evil guy, but it's fun to watch this manipulative slimeball just do as he pleases while playing all sides of the conflict just so he can make more money and get more power.\\n\\n\r\nIt's disappointing then that with Gundam 00 already struggling to have deep characterization it struggles to even resolve its innately likable characters and relationships in ways they deserve. Season 2 met with a lot of complaints, and many of them are deserved. The first problem with season 2 is that it undoes many of the impacting permanent moments of season 1's finale. Characters who were shown as dead basically come back to life, and the status quo is almost reset. A lot of this feels extremely cheap and lazy (especially you-know-who), and like they weren't creative enough to have to write the show in a different direction without the same characters. With most characters being brought back, the already too large cast is increased even further so the problem of distributing character focus evenly gets even worse. In season 2 we have deaths of new characters framed as extremely important and meaningful for other characters, but the audience has only seen this character for a grand total of five minutes so they can't relate. Celestial Being's new enemy are the A-Laws, who are kind of boring because unlike before these antagonists actually are bad people. They're an autonomous force that threatens conflicts with the destruction of both sides, but while they are a lot less discriminatory and involve civilians there's very little attention paid to how this is a similar philosophy to Celestial Being and probably the natural end result of a world where Celestial Being ever grew to a large scale. This hypocrisy could introduce some interesting conflict among CB, but instead it's just acknowledged at best because I guess it was too complicated for the writing staff to want to take on.\\n\\n\r\nThe other Gundam Meisters are pushed to the background as season 2 becomes the Setsuna Show. He gets far, far more fights and screen time than the rest of the cast despite not having gotten any more interesting, and his upgraded Gundam is now unequivocally the most powerful instead of being on par with the others like before. Allelujuah is especially screwed in season 2, his subplot being resolved not even halfway through and then getting no scenes after where he gets to show off or get any glory. It's Setsuna all the way, folks. New villains called the Innovators are also introduced, but their whole gimmick is being boring and near emotionless so that's not very fun. Old, better antagonists are brought back and are as cool or cooler than ever, but Graham Baker and Ali get almost nothing to do. Their final showdowns are hyped up and then the final series of fights at the end of the series are incredibly short and anti-climactic. A very disappointing and satisfying end to some of the most enjoyable elements of the story. Season 2 is also obsessed with sudden twists that have no meaning to them because nothing in hindsight set them up, and a lot of the shock value of these betrayals and deaths out of nowhere are ruined further when it's shown at the start of the next episode that it didn't actually happen or something. Nena's role in season 2 can also be chalked up as another character who didn't need to be added to the story. Saji and Louise are as annoying and childish as ever, but at least they're annoying and childish in scenes that are important this time.\\n\\n\r\nYet, despite all of this out-of-control absurdity and ridiculous resolutions, season 2's good qualities it inherits from the first season manage to mostly overcome its downward stumbling. The pacing is still top-notch, many new action scenarios are captivating and memorable, and because of that fast pacing the absurdity and mistakes of the plot are moved on from quickly. This is unlike older Gundam series which were slower paced and could really dwell on their nonsensical character development, making them a lot less tolerable the more they stayed on screen.\\n\\n\r\nThe production job of Gundam 00 is phenomenal. I can't think of any series of a comparable length I've seen with such incredible animation, and I'm curious what the budget had to have been to accomplish this. Gundam 00 uses digital and CG animation, something I tend to dislike, and through both genuine effort and carefulness avoids the typical problems of both. The conveniences of digital animation are never visibly used to cut corners. Stock footage is unnoticeable throughout the whole series, and the things in digital that usually look poor like the background details or things outside of the frame's focus aren't a problem. There's very little poorly drawn faces and figures in the backgrounds. Though this is evidently not high budget OVA or movie quality due to the simple shading, the show's art in general is still pleasant to look at due to the bright colors and realistically-proportioned characters and objects. A thoroughly very professional and stunning job. The CG is most noticeable on Celestial Being's flagship, the Ptolemaios, but even there it's used tastefully to just give the ship depth as it turns and such, and it looks like they somehow wrapped actual cels over a 3D model so it fits into its 2Dimensional surroundings.\\n\\n\r\nKeeping with the trend of quality, the frame rate is damn good and only lets up in areas where movement is not necessary to convey what's going on, such as characters simply walking around the ship. Even there you kind of have to look for the frame rate to notice the drop. The action scenes in Gundam 00 are simply incredible. The battle of the day trope in Gundam could often be one of the absolute worst parts about a series, but here it's the exact opposite. Any action in Gundam 00 is a highlight, which is good because as a thriller there's a lot of it this time. All action scenes are dynamically choreographed. No more stock footage of a Gundam rotating in place in space and shooting a rifle. These battles contain constant, fast movements that aren't repeated and make the battles feel realistically lively. Visual flair to accompany the clashing machines is generous. Floating multicolored particles as the machines fly through the air, flashes of light as blades connect, beams that actually glow as they're firing, and a consistent double-image effect when the Gundams enter their Trans-Am mode and improve their speeds. Battles are very exciting and a complete joy to watch, which makes the aforementioned short-lived final battles all the more frustrating. There are occasions where the speed of the fights is so fast it's hard to get a grasp on what just happened because frames move so quickly, but I never minded rewinding to see parts of fights again. There's no doubt a very, very uncommon amount of care and money went into Gundam 00's production.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the mech designs, I think they're overall solid for the Gundam franchise, but I don't feel particularly strong about many. The grunt machines look great and more contemporary than usual, where before they could have cartoonish cyclops eyes (you heard me) and the like. There's a real lack of distinct enemy mechs, which is unfortunate. Most are just lightly modified previous models, and the ones that aren't such as the Susano-O and Arche Gundam are my favorite mechs from the series for that reason. I'm pretty sick of the blue/white/red color design for the main Gundam and it's a tradition holding design creativity back at this point, and the season 2 upgrades are pretty boring, basically being the same Gundams as before just with more geometry slapped on.\\n\\n\r\nThe music quality isn't something to write home about like the animation, but it's still well done. It's a typical mix of rock, electronic, and orchestral usually leaning on the latter. Not many songs from the score stand out, but I quite like \u201cFight\u201d, the brassy combat song with uplifting deep choral vocals. It's almost ludicrously epic compared to the rest of the soundtrack, but for a thriller over-the-top intensity is what the series should be going for. It was a mistake to almost never use this song in season 2. Sometime in the mid 2000s nearly every anime decided it was going to have every theme song sound almost identical, and I don't find Gundam 00's exceptions. Though I do find \u201cPast the Tears\u201d by Stereopony (great name) to be pretty catchy. The ending themes weren't anything special either.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now for that recommendation. If you're already a fan of any Gundam (preferably of something 90s or later) or mecha in general, then yes, absolutely watch Gundam 00. It's one of the better Gundam series in general and relative to the genre at large as well. For those still ambivalent on those two things or the series itself, then I'd still recommend it so long as its not necessarily a deal-breaker that the show excels at suspense and action while its characters are mostly just satisfactory. You may need to keep that idea in mind so you don't become so invested in the plot and characters only for season 2 to throw a pie in your face. Still, the action and animation remain very impressive and in the realm of stupid writing in Gundam series, most don't even have that much to fall back in when the going gets rough. And the going can get a lot rougher than this. You can mostly safely consider Gundam 00 as your entry point into the franchise.",

            "content": "What makes a Gundam so darn fascinating? Maybe because instead of shooting each other with a rifle or machine gun, we literally extend our body into a mechanized suit that does the shooting for us. On an unprecedented scale. I was introduced to Gundam when I was much younger, and the appeal never went away. That sharp nagging of \"man, wouldn't it be just dandy to control one of those?\" as powerful as ever. Mobile Suit Gundam 00 far exceeds entertainment value as well as drama, music, and other outstanding characteristics. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nSet in the (almost) near-future, humanity has formed into three relatively accurate blocs:The Union (North/South America), the AEU of Europe, and the Human Reform League that covers most of Asia and Russia. To destroy their reliance on fossil fuel, humanity finally did the sensible thing and created three huge solar power arrays, thereby weaning themselves off of fossil fuels and other rare Earth commodities. This created a Solar Power Wars they frequently mention, but never fully explain. These three blocs, after the Solar Power Wars, currently fight, bicker, and arms-race each other constantly. Suddenly, an organization called Celestial Being randomly announces itself, declaring its message of eradicating war by using force. That extension of that force would be the Gundam Mobile Suit, far more advanced than any other military in the world.\\n\\n\r\nThis, of course, leads to conflict. The whole world simply won't bow down to new masters and obey; human nature isn't naturally submissive. Therefore, the world fights back. Hard. Setsuna, the main protagonist, has a watery past that slowly resolves itself into focus as he pilots his Gundam, Exia. I won't go into much detail, but let's just say the story has enough plot-twists to keep you constantly on your feet and enough mind-numbing action to keep your eyes glued to the screen. Love, love LOVE. And all throughout there is a deeper plot, a more ominous undertone that frequents itself more and more towards the end. It keeps you guessing; there are bigger powers at play here than readily apparent. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nHoly. Shoot. These Gundams were drawn and executed to minute detail; battle scars, battle wounds, flashing lights, explosions, ship carriers, even the environment; it was like an eye-orgasm for a solid 25 minutes. If things weren't exploding in your face, the environment was rapidly changing. There were so many story-plots, it almost became convoluted; however, the art flawlessly transitions to each story, and I loved the emotions in the character's stance. The way the characters were drawn remind me vaguely of Code Geass; tall and lanky, yet these characters were built more stocky and round. I love me some good artwork, though; it didn't matter if the setting was in space or Earth or somewhere else - it was a living, walking, breathing colorful monster of artwork.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEye-gasms aren't the only thing keeping you to the screen. Multiple times my ears overflowed with the dulcet melody of my favorite part of anime: the voice acting. I can't watch English dubs simply because they do not convey the emotional feeling or raw power these characters exhibit by simply being themselves. And Gundam does not disappoint; each character has their own personalities and characteristics, plainly obvious in the voices. The explosions and sound effects shouldn't be ignored either, simply because it was music to my action-prone ears. Beautiful, beautiful sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhy is character development a perfect score? Because it fulfilled my expectations, perhaps exceeding it in some cases. When a main character's arc throughout the story is filled with letdowns, emotional highs, and a roller-coaster of feelings, you're left breathless because you BECOME that character. You feel what he or she feels, you sympathise and pity their impossible predicaments. And when you become this attached, each victory or defeat is either a stab of euphoria or a lance of pain. This also means something crucial: you related to this character, and that's what makes it special. Setsuna is just that sort of person you get attached with. You hate him at first, but then he kind of grows on you. If he's not your type, ladies, there's always the other three male Gundam Meisters and a few other \"hotties\" from other militaries, of course. But I'm off on tangents; main point: the character development was flawless. Every main character had their moment and more, which made for a sound anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was a thing of beauty. There were almost no shortcomings, besides that it should be longer (thank GOODNESS they made a season 2). I know I'm watching this late, but hey, everyone has to start from somewhere. All in all, though, the story was riveting, the artwork dazzling, the sound loud and forceful, the characters beautifully presented. I was not in the least disappointed, and I recommend to all of any age because it was just so darn good. I was left with a glowing feeling of warm satisfaction. And finally: the world is always changing. Will you be the one to change it?",

Because of it's ideological things you should know before watching the continuation . After episode 5++ you will see lots of addictive excitement , how the politics go , how the celestial being's stories , civilian's love story , tragedies and insanities .\r\nBut , there's some reason why Mobile Suit  Gundam 00 is something valuable , creative and unique :\r\n1. The Middle East theme included in story\r\n2. Having an Anno Domini timeline\r\n3.Unpredictable \\n\r\n4. half-way movie directing(J-movies precisely)\\n\r\n5. A matched OP and ED , you'll love\\n\r\n6. Lots of Point of View\\n\r\nSeiji Misuzhima made this anime a more humanism and enjoyable not as a kids's cartoon but as a REAL science-fiction tv series .\\n\\n\r\nArt/Picture :\\n\r\nClean , tidy and total refreshment . They drew based on today's view and what will happen 3 centuries later . The Middle East picture is something not pretty and more to be a beautiful chaos . But ,surely , the lighting or the basic colour choosing is boring .\\n\\n\r\nScore &amp; soundtrack :\\n\r\nthe score is WORST! Choosing , that voice , it's not even dramatic , it's so amateur , i think they should change the score person , if you want to make soap opera score , don't do it here . Btw , the volume of the score is terrible . \\n\r\nBut , the OP &amp; ED are terrific . From L'arc-en-ciel - Daybreak's bell to Stephanie - Friends , the soundtrack matched the anime . Well , except Taja's Love today . Taja's love today is too less-anticipated , we need more dramatic song , just like James Blunt- carry you home or Koda Kumi's Moon cryin. \\n\r\nBut , the most qualified is The Back horn's Wana . It's a total terrific and made the chaos in the anime didn't end until you hear the ending song .\\n\r\nThe OP &amp; ED can be enjoyed not only by &quot;Otaku&quot; but also with &quot;normal&quot; people like me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :\\n\r\nThey're connected clearly and nicely ,and it's quite full of bishonen(is that what Japanese calls handsome/beautiful man?) . But , less special looking bishoujo\\n\r\nSetsuna F. Seiei is a emotionless troublesome kid with dark past and he ''packaged&quot; it in his dumbness and his new belief .\\n\r\nLockon Stratos is a gentleman you will love . \\n\r\nTieria Erde is a FREAK but loyal member to the organization.\\n\r\nAllelujah Haptism is a troublesome , mentally sick (an total emo) man with *unique* name .\\n\r\nIn other faction , you will find the &quot;clown&quot; , Patrick Colasour, the smart witty blonde , Graham Acre , a veteran soldier , Smergie Smirnov and a ex-jihad Ali Al Sarshes .\\n\r\nFor the female , in this anime ,there were less protrude female characters , they're only supporting the male to be stand-out ,i can say there's only two female character really did their role her , one is the Azadistan's Princess and the red head that will appear in the mid of the anime.\\n\r\nThey also have point of view of civilians .\\n\\n\r\nOverall :\\n\r\nA(major) kids can't watch anime , not because of the sex , drugs or the violent . But , it's about the religion , the beliefs  , the politic , the war and the complicated things.",

            "content": "What does it take to stop war?  Is it through peace talking or by force itself?\r\nWhen I first watched Gundam 00, it reminded me a little of Gundam Wing, mainly because it focuses on  4 main characters and their the only ones who has control of the Gundams.   But in this series, it still came out differently which makes it interesting.  It sets in the future world of our own.\r\nStory - Aeolia Schenberg is the founder of the Celestial Being.  Their goal is to eradicate war.  The chosen 4 called the Gundam Meisters, along side with their Gundams,use force interventions to stop war-inflicting elements.  Then there are 3 factions who each take control of the solar energy which not all are getting any benefits from. \\n\\n\r\nAt first, it may be such a drag as you begin taking a glimpse of political conflicts again.  I usually get bored in this part but good thing it doesn't take that quite long before the action begins. \\n\\n\r\nThe interesting part is that the Gundams may look like heroes who will stop war once and for all, but then it makes you think, isn't it through their way of intervention may look like a contradiction of their goal?  As you go along the  series, you wanted to seek answers yourself.  What is the Celestial Being's main purpose?\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, you also get another side story of two civilians popping up as the story goes.   Lovers? Friends? Are they really an important part of the story? \\n\\n\r\nArt - Well-detailed design for the Gundams, adding those GN particles make it look like it has godly powers.  For the characters, well, you can't missed 4 good looking guys although the other one can be mistaken as a girl.  \\n\\n\r\nSound - I didn't had that goosebump feeling when I listen to Gundam music.  But there are background music in the series that gives you a dramatic feeling though, which I can't helped but be teary-eyed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Setsuna F. Seiei, a character that always gives you a flat affect no matter what situation there is.  But despite the lack of personality, he's  a well dedicated pilot of Exia.  Tieria Erde still remains a mystery, aside from having a direct link to \"Veda\".  It seems that Lockon keeps the group together.  The development takes midway in the story.  Just a small glimpse of what their purpose is in becoming the Gundam Meisters.  Also it's not just them that you'll focus on, there are background/extra characters that are quite something to.  Like Graham Acre, amazing Flag pilot.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - What I really love in this series, the battle fights.  It's so exciting to watch it really.  You feel like shouting right at the screen just when you think the 4 Gundams will be caught.  Also let me just say,  hands down to a series that made me teary-eyed, almost cried actually.  One thing that I'll never expect will happen especially if your somehow attached to a character you like.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - It's a great series and how it ended will make you curious for the 2nd season.  It's an action packed series that even a newbie gundam fan would love.\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series because there are surprising twist that I never expected, that makes you grit your teeth in frustration or anger towards certain characters.  Always be ready that in every organization, there's betrayal.  If you're open-minded towards such political views and you have questions as well, then try to watch this.  At least, the gundam fights will keep you entertained while you're at it.\\n",

Something insanely powerful could be overpowered the next episode. I can enjoy shifts in power and the constantly evolving powers of the machines but it felt very empty and pointless for me in 00. You have super soldiers that is never really shown to be more powerful, You have a new ability revealed and shown how monumental it is, only for it to be overpowered in the next episode.\r\nHowever season 2 does startto balance the power levels more and introduce more of a power structure with upgrades and powerups usually lasting more then an episode and having more of an impact",

            "content": "I was introduced to the Gundam Franchise by IBO, around that period in time between the airing of the first and second series - that is to say, before it totally went downhill. I then investigated 00, SEED and its corresponding trainwreck of a sequel, and the first few episodes of many other Gundam series. One thing struck me, and that was that this franchise seems to have one thing in common with itself every time: It frequently starts strong, but becomes disillusioned in the latter half, or the sequel. Of them all, 00 has the least loopholes and therefore, by that reasoning, it isthe best.\\n\\n\r\nI'm also not saying this from a biased perspective, as my favourite happens to be Seed (who knows why, it's not even that good) but 00 is all-round better quality. As an added bonus, it's also the prettiest, what with the majority others having somewhat dated (but by no means bad) art styles, but I don't believe anyone could deny 00 to be pretty sleek - art-wise, music-wise, even animation-wise.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a diverse cast. The MC is a quiet, self-contained and reserved character of few words. It makes for an interesting story, as Setsuna has a history, and the few clues dropped will keep the viewer hooked to find out more. This is good, and it makes for an interesting, many-faceted story, but as a result, character development is minimal at best. 00 is a plot-driven show from the start and it remains such until the end.\\n\\n\r\nThis story starts out, and slowly introduces very many loose ends and threads, and as it progresses, everything is weaved into a tale that will have you question the morality and purpose for human existence. At first, you might wonder why your time was wasted by some seemingly irrelevant bystanders getting a good deal of screen-time, or why the astonishing number of antagonists that might not be antagonists at all, or why the Gundams themselves are on a level far too OP to make for any tension in the action. Everything comes together, and a lot of questions you didn't even know to ask are answered.\\n\\n\r\nBut I found myself questioning the point. It all ended with a sense of dissatisfaction. Sure, there's conflict. Then more conflict. Then more, and it snowballs. That was quite interesting to witness, but as someone who loves to delve into the mind-space of the characters, it was challenging to see everything end without a resolution that truly felt conclusive. But at the end of the day, 00 is an action mech show - and one of the best of the best at that - thus, it is highly recommended.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, if you don't want to see all logic destroyed, I suggest you steer clear of the sequel movie. Wishing you fun in viewing Celestial Being change the order of the world, thanks for reading.",

            "content": "My crusade of watching every Gundam series continues. Even though I had already finished this show when it aired on the Sci-Fi Channel, I put it upon myself to re-watch the 2007 installment of the super-successful Gundam meta-franchise once the entire series was added (in Japanese) on Crunchyroll. Now, after finishing it, I've grown a stronger respect for this intricately detailed, gloriously animated piece of work that may very well be my favorite Gundam series so far. This is my review for Mobile Suit Gundam 00.\r\nI'd like to start by complimenting the amount of work put into the characters in this show. Gundam 00's writerssuccessfully build an enormous ensemble cast, with several characters from each of the three sects all receiving impressive development. The show's lead is clearly Setsuna F. Seiei, but he's only a small piece of the huge world the writing staff crafts. Sometimes, however, the show loses focus on some of its players. Saji and Louise's romantic subplot isn't fully paid off until episode 18; far too late in the series to justify all of the time we've spent on these two who, up until that point, hadn't been driving the events forward at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is also well-crafted, although the work put in here isn't quite up to the level of the characters. On many occasions, coincidences or last-minute Gundam power-ups are used to prevent Celestial Being from getting their asses handed to them throughout most of the series. This makes the writing look lazy, although the show does make up for most of it by riding up the intensity of the action occurring throughout the show's many action sequences even if we know that somehow and someway, the Gundams will always win.\\n\\n\r\nNext up is the animation, which is mostly consistent. Character designs are solid, and the chaotic action scenes are well-constructed. Unfortunately, there are a few flubs here and there throughout the show, but the show benefits from having a much smaller episode count and thus can stretch out its production budget more efficiently. So, it's not perfect but it's better than what this franchise had seen recently (looking at you, Seed and Seed Destiny).\\n\\n\r\nOf course, being the Kenji Kawai whore that I am, I have to comment on the soundtrack. Overall, it's really good, but far from Kawai's best. The main problem this show's soundtrack has is that several action pieces tend to sound out of place. On one occasion early in the show's run, the women of Celestial Being are all playing on the beach but the piece playing is obviously intended for an action scene. Also, aside from the main theme of the Gundams, the remainder of the score is mostly forgettable. It sounds great while it's playing, but once it's over it's hard to remember the piece. Both opening themes are instantly memorable across the board, but both endings have bland vocals. As much as it pains me to say it, the soundtrack overall is a mixed bag.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to sum things up, Gundam 00 may not satisfy the die-hard fans of the franchise. The Gundams have questionable designs (seriously, hair?), but they're better than the clunky and interchangeable designs from Seed and Seed Destiny in my honest opinion. However, as a futuristic war story, it excels. Honestly, I think the war story angle was what the writers set out to do in the first place. Die-hard fans can complain it, but they have Universal Century to suit their needs. The Ado Domini universe is one of the most interesting universes the Gundam franchise has ever told, and all they had to do was go 300 years into OUR future to tell it. \\n\\n\r\nNow, onto Mobile Suit Gundam 00 Second Season...",

            "content": "So here it goods my first review on this website haha. As I'm writing this I'll try not to spoil major plot points or any for that matter if I can, however I will leave a warning just for the readers discretion. Anyway onto the review.\r\nTo start Mobile Suit Gundam 00 is one of favourite anime that I have watched in the last few years saying that it doesn't come without it's flaws. Let's start with the story section.\r\nGundam 00 is set in the 24th century in which humanity is split into three power blocks called The Union, AEU and Human Reform League each ofthese have their own space elevator that also provides with power from sun. All three worked in cooperation to achieve this technological feat but, relations between the three power blocks are still tense which has hindered humanity working together as a whole, which in turn have created pockets of small conflicts around the globe. The is where Celestial Being enter the picture to achieve their ultimate goal of a world without war.\\n\r\nNow the first thing I have to say about the story is that it does a great job of questioning ones moral ideals/beliefs. There were many times when I watched this asking myself 'is what Celestial Being really doing the right thing or not?', and the lack of knowing what Celestial Being true ultimate goal at the end this made it all the more interesting. The journey from start to end for this anime is quite something not only for the main plotline but, also for the side stories which give valuable insight into some of characters personality and why it's like that. However I say some for reason, there are a few clich\u00e9d backstories which we've seen many a times from previous Gundams shows making you sigh at the lack of creativity. Other backstories are pointless to know about cause they add nothing to the story, or they sound interesting just never develop on the idea. An example of this Colonel Sergei Smirnov backstory about how he got his nickname all you ever find out in the end is that he only got from using a fancy tactic in battle? So yeah be prepared to be disappointed for some character backstories. Others for instance like Aeolia Schenberg's you can understand the lack of the backstory because the mystery behind his creation for Celestial Being but, when it's others like Smirnov I do expect more haha.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art in this show is beautiful for the time it came out in many cases even surpassing shows in 2017. The designs for the Gundams themselves are stunning and in many cases more memorable than ones in recent Gundam shows like AGE and IBO, all of them having unique capabilities. For instance, Exia is designed for close quarters combat nicknamed 'The Seven Swords' for a reason (and trust me you'll know why :P), Kyrios transforms into a Starfighter allowing from high mobility both in and out of atmosphere, Dynames excels in long range combat using sniper projectile weaponry and finally Virtue is pretty much a tank with big guns that transform into the more mobile Nedlah. So you can see why many Gundam fans praise the Gundam designs and their unique combat style.\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are as you expect them to be in any Gundam show good rendering, not over clustered with pointless things and just simple to see what's happening in the surrounding world, however don't expect jaw-dropping detailed environments. Just appreciate the good work put into the background to make the mobile suits and characters themselves stand out.\\n\\n\r\nNow for me sound has been quite the 50/50 thing for me in Gundam shows, in Gundam Seed I was disappointed with the sound of the plasma weapons (you could also argue the fact that it came out just at the turn of the 21st century but still) on the other hand I was pleasantly pleased with the heavy metal of traditional firepower from IBO. In Gundam 00 though the sound for firearms is great and sound like they should except for Exia's for some reason they just sound a bit off sometimes but, I have got to say though the sound effects for the slicing and dicing of Exia's swords are top notch to be honest as a whole every melee weapon sounded great.\\n\\n\r\nFor characters I will mainly talk about the four main protagonists of the show, as there's just too many to go through like every Gundam show, Setsuna, Lockon, Allelujah and Erde. Setsuna is your typically character that doesn't speak much but, when he does you just have to pay attention. I don't know if its just me or not but, when Setsuna spoke I was just drawn in instantly because more often than not he asks and says some interesting things about why humanity does what it does during the season. The only annoying thing about him is why doesn't he speak more! Lockon is the more outgoing talkative member of the team, he likes to create banter him and his fellow members often stirring them up (in a good way haha) by commenting on the situation at hand. The thing I like most about Lockon is his presence in the show, just seeing him on scene you know he's going to do or say something encouraging.\\n\r\nAllelujah is a special here because there's two of him. What I mean is There's the calm and rather reserved Allelujah and then there's his kill crazed other self Hallelujah. This makes an interesting combination as on a few occasion they interact with one another through quantum brainwaves creating some funny yet badass moments of the show. To be honest many of the best moments came from Hallelujah himself as he just so unpredictable in what he's thinking.\\n\r\nFinally we come to Erde my least favourite character of the team but, still enjoyable to see on screen, he's the more calculated of the team wanting to fellow every by the book no matter what. This does lead to why he's my least favourite of the four because on two occasions he tries to kill he fellow team members because they didn't go by the 'book'. However this does make him the most reliable of the team, as on many occasions in the show the other team members abandon mission objectives for personal endeavours making Erde a trustworthy character knowing he won't betray or backstab them without a perfectly valid reason.\\n\r\nAlso on a side note I wanted to express my disappointment in what happened to the two Trinity brothers hence the 9 rating (you'll know what I mean when you see it) damn you Sunrise!!!\\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment you won't be disappointed especially if you're a mecha fan like myself. If you're just a person who'll just watch anything that catches your interest then this'll also be a must watch if they asked me but, obviously it's down to personal preference. And if you're not a mecha fan, well I don't need to say anymore haha.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is great with a few minor drawbacks that affected my experience in watching it but, not to the point annoying me, on the other hand though you may not have a probably with those things. Like I said previously I'd recommend this show to anyone unless you're not a mecha fan. Gundam 00 is simply a must watch how you perceive it afterwards is up to you. You could say that my review is unbiased as I am an avid mecha fan but, that wont chance my stance on that I would say this is a must watch.",

            "content": "I am a  big time Gundam fan (even Gunpla building), but not one of the conservative fans, so I mostly watch all Gundams without the judgment. That being said, I can state that Gundam 00 is a must watch, even if you are unsure if you like the \"mecha genre\".\r\nStory: the story of the first season is awesome and you will get hooked from the beginning. The strongest part of the narrative is that Gundam 00 takes place in our world, which is different from the other Gundam. You will see some nice future predicting stuff if the technology in the series could beachieved. You will see some real world-related problems, and nice pacing for the story to unfold. I can`t say more without ruining your fun, so I`ll just say that it's a good story. \\n\\n\r\nArt and sound: Both awesome. Gundam 00 was the first Gundam to go HD from the beginning, so they wanted to impress. And the did. The OST is also outstanding. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Well, that my only real complaint. Although they are good characters I don't feel they were explored to the fullest. See, they have AWESOME backstories, and they could have been majorly developed. Unfortunately, that not what happens. They will get some developing, but you can`t expect much. Thus, this is my lowest score, I don`t know why they choose to not go further as they could. Additionally, as all Gundam, you will follow a lot of characters, which is always nice. But... in the case of Gundam 00, you will have to deal with Saji and Louise... Man... Just... Argh... Another complaint is that some secondary or tertiary characters have more screen time and more developing than the Gundam pilots...which are the ones you want to know more. Although most of the secondary and tertiary are interesting, this is one of the odd decisions I am talking about. Nevertheless, you will still enjoy the different personalities and mystery surrounding all of them.\\n\\n\r\nMechas: Gunpla builders must talk about mechas. Gundam 00 as hardcore originals when it comes to mechas. Of course, as always, the blue/red/white Gundam is always present, but they are all awesome. Exia is a marvelous melee-based mecha and Dynames (my favorite) has a unique design and gimmick on the show. Virtue is one of kind, the first Gundam that I see that do what he does. The only more common is Kyrios, that is your standard \"mecha that turns into a plane\". Still, the other Mobile Suits from Earth are also pretty well designed with way cooler mechanical designs that your standard Zaku. The mechas shine as bright as ever in Gundam 00.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is one of the best Gundam I ever watched and even if you are not a mecha-person, you still have to watch this anime.",

            "content": "Gundam 00 was one of the earlier Anime's I watched, so my eyes may be clouded by nostalgia, but Ill try to be fair.\r\nThis is one of the few shows that I have watched through twice, once in sub and once in dub and I enjoyed both runs equally, which means the dub must be pretty good in my opinion, so watch whichever is your own personal preference.\r\nThe overarching story I found intriguing, carried out in depth and going off on tangents depending on occurring events. The political and social aspects of the show I enjoyed greatly, with the characters own unique backgrounds being wellexplored for the main characters, although some of the background characters were a little shallow with not much solo air time.\\n\r\nThe mobile suit designs I loved, with the shift in power across the series due to the suits that were available to each side building up suspense. \\n\r\nGundam 00 is also one of the very few shows that got me close to crying, which will be understood if watched.\\n\r\nOverall I highly, highly recommend Gundam 00, having loved watching it myself. One of the larger problems I had was that it was the first Gundam series I watched, which meant that I was always subconsciously comparing the other Gundams to it, which due to my love of 00 caused an unrealistically high bar for the others (although I have of course gotten great enjoyment out of the other Gundam series' I've watched).",

            "content": "Gundam 00 is mainly about an organization called Celestial Being who's main goal is to eradicate war. To enforce their noble ideals, they use advance mobile suits called Gundams. Gundams are deployed to a battlefield wherever it maybe in the world and attack both sides to end the conflict, this is known as one of their arm intervention. So will they achieve their goal of creating world peace? That is an answer that can only be found out by watching the series :D\r\nStory: The story is pretty interesting. A small group of people with advance technology trying to create peace through violence. Kind of contradicting,but it is pretty much like the saying of fighting fire with fire. Now the plot is pretty simple, not too complex to understand, and not much of those puzzling moments where you're just like \"How did that happened?\" or \"What the...?\" It pretty simple because it is an action anime so it is mostly fighting and explosions. However in the midst of all this, there is the subplot of Saji Crossroads and Louise Halevy. Some may say that their little skit is annoying or irrelevant to the series sometime, but I think this is what make Gundam 00 kind of unique from the other series in the fact that it shows how the lives of normal citizen, completely not related to combat, feels and how they react to the war. So if you are looking for an anime with action and explosions and some decent plot/theme, I would recommend this anime to you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I have to say that this is probably one of the best artwork for an anime I have seen. The Gundams are finely detailed and well drawn, and the character just look stunning. The pictures are pretty good that even SD is practically the same as 480p. The scenes are nice, though some battles just seem so exaggerated like the explosion that happens after a mobile suit gets cut in half, the guy piloting it HAS to finish his sentence first before it actually become a huge explosion. Well beside that the artwork and animation was just fabulous. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack is just amazing. The OP and ED really does fit in with the theme of the anime. Like the first OP \"DAYBREAK'S BELL\" by L'arc~en~Ciel has great beat and fits perfectly with the opening animation, and it just gets you ready for the upcoming episode. The ED is also great because it kind of give you that wrapping up feel. Overall I personally loved the soundtrack, and could never skipped it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The cast of Gundam 00 is quite colorful in my opinion. At first the Gundam Meisters(pilots of the Gundams) looked like they are cold hearted, even robotic kind of people, just like their Gundams. But as you watch on, you see how they are actually more colors than that first black and white impression. Trying to not give off to many spoilers here, but you learn how each of the Meisters have their own dark, even sometime bloody past, that makes them who they are and give them purpose to fight on. Now with the civilian point of view from Saji and Louise, they are an interesting young couple. They are young and always seem to be having fun,and carefree, always commenting on the war, not knowing what it is like, but as the series goes on, they become more mature as they soon see that even though they are not in the warzone, it still affects them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I have to say that this was one of my favorite Gundam series. Though in the beginning, like the first episode, the Gundam from Celestial Being just seem too powerful. At first I was thinking that was so awesome, but then I was thinking how can this series be fun when its going to be nothing but a one sided battle, but as I watch on, it wasn't the way I thought it was.Making it become even more exciting. At the end of each episode it just made me want to watch the next one, like their wasn't a \"pause\" feeling for this anime series. The theme of this series was great, though it may not be original, but the way it was delivered was just awesome, and seeing all of the character development was also worthwhile. This series was absolutely great, I really loved it, and is currently watching the second season with no disappointment :D, but I'll save the comments for it in its own review. Well hope this helped! If it didn't please leave a comment saying why it didn't or if it did please leave a comment too saying why it was good! Well hope you enjoy!",

            "content": "Mobile Suit Gundam 00, is the eleventh incarnation of Sunrise\u2018s long-running Gundam franchise, and consists of two seasons (50 episodes total). It is the first Gundam series to be animated in HD widescreen, also the first Gundam to be set in a non-fiction A.D. timeline. It aired in Japan from October 2007-March 2009.\r\nUnlike Gundam SEED, the pace of Mobile Suit Gundam 00 begins at full throttle; we see the fragile peace of the world start to crumble. Celestial Being is a powerful organization intent on ending war forever with the help of their Gundam meisters. Gundam 00 has epic battles, tense confrontations, and a fewshonen clich\u00e9s that may seem predictable to anime cynics.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the futuristic setting and political games are carefully crafted, the speed at which this show begins causes underdeveloped characters. Aside from their roles with Celestial Being, not many details of their lives are given. Gundam 00 prefers bursts of mission-oriented action to the planned escalation of Seed. There is no human spirit, and the main Gundam meister Setsuna remains cold & unlikeable throughout most of season 1. With no empathy anchor, Gundam 00 is difficult to enjoy apart from a purely cerebral or aesthetic level.\\n\\n\r\nAs season 2 begins, The new global government decides to take action against Celestial Being, while the main characters keep up their goal of eliminating war. The ending action scenes, explosive and plentiful, are finally able to create some tension and the puppet pilots get some long-awaited character development. For example, Setsuna matures, and seems less robot-like. Gundam 00 does manage to pull itself together, and delivers a decent ending.\\n\\n\r\nTo Gundam 00\u2019s credit, the animation quality is extraordinary, and has some of the most appealing mecha fight scenes yet. Gundam 00 proves that the franchise may yet be financially viable, but that Sunrise is unwilling to escape the mold of past Gundam series. While an attractive and intelligent series, Gundam 00 was somewhat lifeless and unoriginal. If this is your first exposure to Gundam (or Shonen in general) you may find this enjoyable. Otherwise, it\u2019s\u2026ok.",

I really love the story with this one, I think it draws you in and makes you really like the characters.  I really like it when they blur the lines between which side is doing good, and which side is doing the most harm.  The mobile suit fights are amazing, I think this series does some very interesting things with their Gundams that you don't expect.  The animation, really top notch.  I really have a hard time finding something negative about this series, so Iwont struggle to do so.",

            "content": "(I revamped the review completely, as I think reading it must be pretty painful, since it's just one sentence after the other, attempting to form a concise review. It's still probably going to contain minor spoilers, so please keep that in mind. Since my memories of the series are pretty vivid, you can ask me about the series on my profile.)\r\nGundam 00 - Many people consider this series to be an edgefest or a bad series entirely, which is, surprisingly for the fandom, understandable. Some consider it a masterpiece of huge proportions, maybe after the disappointment from the SEED and SEED Destiny series. I don'tconsider it to be any of these - while the series is definitely solid and brings some nice, fresh ideas to the old table of Gundam, I don't believe it is a holy grail of unbelievable power. I'll attempt to explain that later.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nFor once, this story is pretty decently original, lacking a lot of previous stuff that made older series feel a bit... stale. While this is very true for the first season, I cannot say that about the second one. That's for another time, howver. Anyway...\\n\r\nA set of four Gundams, mysterious curbstomping powerhouses arrive on Earth to eliminate conflict... by using conflict. Not gonna even try to fight that, I guess. When I say curbstomping, I really mean it. The enemy of Celestial Being, the organization using the Gundams, can only fight these mobile suits using a unbelievable amount of their own mobile suits, and even then it's probably doomed to fail. In case this falls out of the window, only ace pilots can stand against these suits - and that's for later anyway. You're going to see that while you watch the series.\\n\r\nSummary of the story is that while it's well-built and decently original, there's some obvious points of it that either don't make sense, or aren't well executed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThis one was just a gimme in my opinion. The designs look awesome. Especially the Flags and the GN Particle powered Gundams. Speaking of those, they also look neat, with a nicely sleek drive that emits them.\\n\r\nAll of the coloring is neatly done, despite looking a bit pale at times. The visceral glory in combat scenes is also very neat and helps the immersion.\\n\r\nSummary? Not needed, it's great imo.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nWhile the sound is very well done, I don't remember much aside the opening music. Some of the music in the scenes is neat, but tends to be forgettable. Moving on from that, the GN weapons have a nice kick and that slight hum that helps them make feel a bit better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nSimply put, all of the Gundam Meisters have a quirk. Setsuna is pretty edgy and quiet at first, but it's explained why and he opens up later. While some characters just exist to be evil, and some exist to be killed off later, all of them are pretty well done, and that's a big plus for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nSince I like games with tons of combat, glory and story, this one fills all needs perfectly. All fight scenes are nicely done and they're really fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nA nice series with most nice things I need in an anime.\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Excellent visuals and fight scenes, along with an original plot\\n\r\n-Sound is nice\\n\r\n-Most characters\\n\r\nCons: \\n\r\n-Music tends to be forgettable\\n\r\n-Some characters feel more edgy than the swords in the series\\n\r\n-They're also a bit forgettable",

It follows the story of Setsuna F. Seiei, Lockon Stratos, Allelujiah Haptism, and Tieria Arde (spelling on names?) in a group called Celestial Being.\r\nEach character has their own history and background, and is executed well into the main plot.

This task is givento the paramilitary organization celestial being. What i really like is that the enemy is not always clear because the allies can become enemies and enemies allies and at the same time there are people WHO support both the good and the bad guys.There some things though which arent realistic even for a mecha sci fy anime.What happens in the end of season 1(that affects all the second season) was unexpected for the three major millitary and political powers which fought hard to not become like \"this\" But in the end is a serious story with a dark tone and surely will captivate people despite few flaws that you may encounter\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:Not much to say , the art is at least gorgeous.The lighting effects are great and the mecha battles surely are mouth watered.The reused animation scenes are very few and not important at all to make you not like this anime.In the end if one of your criteria for  choosing an anime concerns animation quality you will not face any problem with this one\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound was perfect.I enjoyed most of the opening and ending songs. The sound director knew when the scene was for a dramatic,fighting,post battle or romance song.And every ost he gave us was very good and unique.\\n\r\nCharacters: Well this is the most interesting part because it is the \\n\r\ncharacters that drive this story . Gundam 00 has a big cast and the thing is that most of them have a good development from the start to finish.The idea that every season should have  (a) year(s) gap is great because we see the characters to change physically too.Think about it we have anime with 10 seasons and the characters are still the same and we have anime that they cant even properly develop their main cast.This doesnt happen here.\\n\r\nHere i must also give congrats to the voice actors, they did an excellent job and they made me believe for a short time that what i was watching was Real.Not to mention that few voice actors even from the original gundam return to take voice roles from A.D universe.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:What i can say, i really love this anime even that is mecha there are more things to look forward here.For this reason i suggest this anime to all anime fans even if they are familliar with the gundam series and even they like or not the mecha genre",

            "content": "The Gundam franchise... to some people it seems like something that is more of an exclusive club for hardcore mecha fans. A sort of V.I.P only place, where everything is sort of connected to each other in some way. I can see how that is perceived... they have their own Wiki site that is rather extensive in the Gundam Lore. Here's the thing though, you don't have to know anything about Gundam to enjoy Mobile Suit Gundam 00. \r\n*Note- This review will only focus on the first season of Gundam 00 as their are two seasons, I have decided that I will not review themtogether as one entity due to reasons I'll explain later.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\nOur story focus around Celestial Being, an organization with the mighty and noble goal of eliminating all war from the world. The plan to do this with the use of Gundams of which they have four of. They go around the world to areas of conflict, military bases, and other places to do armed interventions... which means they go blow stuff up. What I love about the story is that the issues that are going on in this part of the future are also very relevant to current event issues. It's also a not super advanced future that I just got lost in all the technology (for the most part) The thing about the story is that it's very hard to tell who exactly is in the right. Is Celestial Being doing the right thing? It's a question that is often asked by the characters in the story and speaking of....\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nThe characters are what really set this show apart. Our main protagonist is Setsuna F. Seiei, a young Gundam Meister who works for Celestial Being. He can very much be labeled as the stereotypical quiet, blunt and extremely talented character, but the way he evolves throughout season makes him so much more real. Setsuna is rather naive in his thinking in regards to his armed interventions, but he is one of the main people in the series that asks the tough questions. What makes that even better is the questions he asks are actually very realistic, they aren't extremely philosophical they're just meaningful. The other mains are the three remaining Gundam Meisters. Tieria Erde is by far the most intelligent of all of them and you can definitely tell. He speaks with major certainty and confidence, but that makes it hard for him to get along with some of the other Gundam meisters. Then there is Allelujah Haptism. Yes his name has some symbolic meaning but that's not important currently. What is important is he gets so major development as well, but it was done over short little bursts. He usually is calm and collective but his past affects many of his decisions, and he sometimes goes nuts during combat as it going on a rampage. Last of the mains is Lockon Stratos. He is the sort of older brother of the group. He is the unofficial leader of the Gundam meisters. He is always calm and in control, very rarely does he act up and get enraged. Lockon to me is also the only one that keeps the Gundam meisters from killing each other. The supporting cast is rather extensive so I'll only mention a few. First is the Ms. Sumeragi who is the tactical forecaster for Celestial Being. She takes charge of all the operation planning and making sure they run smoothly. There is also Felt, a young crew member of Celestial Beings main ship Ptolemaios. She's rather shy and she keeps track of the Gundam meisters during combat, most of her development comes in season two. Lastly Marinia Ismail, the first princess of Azadistan. Her country is being hurt by solar power making oil less valuable. Marinia seeks aid of foreign countries which leads to Celestial Beings interventions. Her and Setsuna have many things in common and they seem to share a common goal as both are from the middle east. As you can tell the characters are extensive and well thought out. The interactions between them, and how they all connect to the main story are what make this show so great\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION:\\n\r\nMy lord this show looks amazing!! The animation quality for this show is outstanding. Never once did I see any hiccups in animation. It was silky smooth and super crisp. Never is this more prevalent than in the many action scenes this show has. The mobile suit battles are something to behold. The design of the Gundams are also very good I especially love the design of Exia (Setsuna's Gundam) The mobile suits of the varying alliances are also rather fitting for the area that they are in. Character designs are also very much to my liking. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nThe openings for Gundam 00 are very nice indeed. The soundtrack is very good at getting you engaged in the story and enveloped in the battles. The dub for this show is outstanding. I know I praise him a lot but he deserves it, Brad Swaile does an excellent job as Setsuna, giving him a very real feeling to me. Samuel Vincent does a perfect job as Tieria, Richard Ian Cox does great as Allelujah especially when he gets angry. Then there's Alex Zahara as Lockon.... his voice is like butter to my ears, just silky smooth, I could listen to him all day. His calm relaxing voice is just so great to hear. The supporting cast also was voice acted very well. On the Japanese side I notice that Mamoru Miyano is there so yea, go nuts he's good. I didn't watch it subbed because the dub is so excellent and I recommend watching this show dubbed.\\n\\n\r\nENDING (No spoilers):\\n\r\nI always talk about this and if you've read my reviews you know where this could be heading. This is the first season of a seasons (plus movie) show. What kinda odd is that this show probably could've ended after this one season. It may have left many questions for me and probably made me angry that there isn't more, it would also lose several points for leaving a few plot holes (which get filled in season 2) but it could've been moderately acceptable, lucky for us there are two seasons to this whole section could actually be disregarded. \\n\\n\r\nI don't want to say that this show has something for everyone but it kinda does. If you love characters Gundam 00 has them. If you love action, it has it. If you love a great story, it has that. If you love romance.... well Gundam 00 doesn't actually have anything really major of that. Needless to say, Gundam 00 is an amazing show. I loved this show to death! If i ever buy a boat with jet skis, I'm naming them after some of the Gundams from this show. I named my fantasy football team Celestial Being... this show (season 1) is simply amazing. I give it my full recommendation to watch and enjoy. This has been one of my most extensive reviews and I was more than glad to do so, Gundam 00 is simmply a masterpiece to behold.",

So Mobile Suit Gundam 00 is my first ever Gundam show and i have to say that 00 is very well made. \r\n-Story \r\nBasically the story revolves  around the typical group of good-looking men using mobile suits who engage inany conflict and intervene it, and thus advance their cause. I didn't really expect much from this show, since i imagined that it's just about some bunch of giant robots fighting each other. Much to my surprise 00 is very psychological and actually involves a lot of politic and strategy. \\n\r\nTo be honest, the story is very intriguing and exciting at first but then seems to lose its charm. It relies on action, the fighting,  where the battles are won by overwhelming the other side with enormous force. This is repetitive, and the story progresses by repeating the same event. This is actually not a bad thing, but considering the lack of drama and where the show almost focuses entirely on the fighting, it really does feel repetitive. Of course there are some side stories to ease up the pace, but still in the end it all comes down to the fighting and winning by overpowering the other side, again, with some unknown ability or an unpredictable coincidence. \\n\\n\r\nSometimes the politics and problems feels very similar to our current real life affairs and just seem to be very realistic. But then again, the science in which where the gundams are easily repaired in space or how they could get from one place to another easily and a bunch of other stuff, is not fully explained.\\n\r\n Most successful shows are on top because they represented a strong sense of reality and an explanation that comes after it. Where every incident is acceptable to our senses and computes to our way of thinking. This is what 00 was lacking and is one of the reasons why it didn't reach the top.\\n\r\nBut then again, this is just my opinion. A lot of people don't  seem to really mind this.\\n\\n\r\nAlso 00 seems to have some side characters who are not exactly involved but gets way more screen time. Which is disturbing, since there are more important characters in the show that actually gets very little screen time. I'm guessing that what they're trying to do is show how things are like from a civilian point of view. Even so, it is very unnecessary and they could've used the screen time to add some drama or explain some past events -since only a few is actually explained- to optimize the story. \\n\\n\r\n-Art\\n\r\nThe art is great, in terms of a mecha anime. 00 portrays the fighting very clearly and it does seem very fluid. Each mobile suits are very detailed, not overly customized, and filled with vibrant colors that looks very lively. The same goes for the background. 00 brings different backgrounds with very detailed structure.\\n\r\nAs for the characters, i'd say that sunrise has done a good job in giving a different look on each of the characters. They don't seem similar with the others, and there is a clear distinction between the main and the side characters. That being said, supposedly the characters are to come from different nationalities. This imbues another problem, it's kinda hard to determined the actual difference of where they are from. You can distinguish them from one another, but all of them look all the same. Without the flags telling us where they're from, one could get confused of which side is this character is on.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound\\n\r\nI have no real complaints for the sound section, the Opening and Ending themes seem to really fit the show, especially Daybreak's Bell, since i'm a fan of L'Arc~en~Ciel.\\n\r\nAnd as you can see 00 hired a group of high class voice actors filling in their characters. And their voice just fits perfectly. \\n\\n\r\n-Character\\n\r\nWhen i said that 00 is well made, it is probably because of the characters. This show presents a plenty of variety of characters. Each of the characters are unique in their own way. The main characters are crafted remarkably well with specific personality traits. They seem to resemble themselves in their own fashion. \\n\r\nAll of them have a clear development, how each incident could change their way of thinking. It feels very human and not rushed. But in my opinion each of the main character's past is not equally explored and explained. Probably because this is the first season, still it gives the impression that 00 only cares about the 'main-main' character's past and doesn't seem to bother explaining the others ,particularly Tieria. Whether this is intentional -to make him seem more mysterious- is unclear.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment and Overall\\n\r\nI enjoyed 00 very much, it has a good story-line with a lot of different characters and an amazing art. Even so, i'm little skeptical about the story, so a 9 feels like it's to good but at the same time an 8 just doesn't suit 00. \\n\r\nFor both fans or newcomers who have never seen any of the previous Gundam show and like mecha fighting shows like Code Geass/Gurenn, 00 is a great show to check out.\\n",

When I first watched this I actually thought about the future being somewhat like what is projected in this anime. If there's one thing I didn't like, it would be that some of the characters were far too cliche. For example, Setesuna F. Seiei's character was very similar to Heero Yuy of Gundam Wing. I was hoping for new types of personalities. But overall I think they did a great job with this anime and I amvery excited for the movie!",

I have to say I really enjoyed it. As far as Mecha goes it's the sort of thing I like in Mecha. Being more realistic combat action rather than monsters fighting robots or super robot. \r\nStory \r\nI really enjoyed this show, despite the bad taste I got in the first 5 episodes. The story didn't go where I wanted it to go, but went were I expected it to go. This did lessen my enjoyment of the series somewhat butthe conclusion was somewhat in the right direction. But in the end I can't argue that I didn't get into the story and that I didn't enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nTech \\n\r\nThe technical side of the show being Art, Sound and Special Effects where all high quality so no need to further explain on this and the designs of everything where quite satisfactory. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nNow the point which really took away points from the show was the Characters. Never before have I enjoyed a show so much where I didn't like any of the characters. It's quite odd. It's nothing to do with how they where designed, just what the characters were. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nIn conclusion it's a show which should be on your to-watch list if you enjoy Mecha. Otherwise I really wouldn't bother unless you have an interest in politics. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nI think I will be watching allot more Gundam series in the future.",

However, this is one of the exceptions. I really like how the characters are designed, and I applaud the way the mobile suits are drawn.\r\nSound: The OST was OK, and most of the time it was the right music at the right time. The bigger part of this sound review is about the openings.Daybreak's Bell may be well liked by many fans, but it did not really appeal to me, since its background guitar and drum music was not really as appealing compared to other anime openings. However, Ash Like Snow is awesome and would make a good opening for many psychological action animes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters that I mainly focused on were Lockon, Allelujah, Setsuna, and Chris. Chris is basically your happy go-lucky and sometimes absent-minded girl. Lockon is basically your average badass with a slice of cool. Setsuna is a person who is dedicated to ending conflicts and doing stuff for the better good. Allelujah has a slice of sociopath (Hallelujah) and is kind of like Shinji Ikari in that he basically just hates his life and tends to go berserk. Unlike Shinji, however, Allelujah wasn't forced into Celestial Being. These characters were special and I liked it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed this series, since it provided a large amount of juicy action involving mobile suits. It also had a slice of psychological and dark stuff, making it a very good anime\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think this is a great anime and that it is worth watching and remembering.",

The show is pretty much one sided in the first half, the gundams are fast and very powerful. The gundams pretty much overwhelms the opposing forces even with just 4 units. The second half is more interesting because the battles are not one sided anymore. Near the end because of  trans-am system, the gundams became somewhat the DBZ of mecha anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe fighting sequences are probably the best part of the series.

            "content": "Story: 10/10\r\nI can't remember what first made me decide to watch this anime, but I was a pretty big Gundam SEED fan and was hungry for more and I heard that this was the next best thing, maybe even better. Boy - did I hear correctly! One of the things I love most about Gundam is that it isn't set in an alternate universe or anything, it's always set in an imagined future. The thing about Gundam 00 is that it's imagined future was really thought out well and it's like an actual possible future for our current world! At first, as always, the storyis very political and you get introduced to all the factions and organizations and their goals, etc. It really reminded me of Code;Geass/Death Note, what with Celestial Being playing the \"peace-keeping/justice\" role for Earth. Every single episode was very interesting and manages to progress through the story one way or another. One of the main points is the mystery Celestial Being in every episode. It just leaves you more curious at the end of each ep to want to continue on to the next one. I don't know how to explain much more without spoiling, but.. The story was amazing.\\n\r\nThere was nothing to complain about with the ending and it did a marvelous job of leading into Season 2.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nEach and every one of the Gundam meisters had amazing backstories that created their individuality/current personas and yes, you actually find out each of their pasts. I can't really say what they are without spoiling though. One of the unique things about this anime is that there really isn't simply 1 main character. All the meisters are as equally important as the other! The relationships between them and their backgrounds are but simply one of the many reasons why this anime was so good. All of the Gundam meisters are soo cool too! XD (As well as their Gundam's of course~)\\n\r\nHeck, I'd confidently say that every single character in this anime was perfectly created. I was even fans of the Antagonists, one of which is voiced by my fave: Kugimiya Rie!!\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 10/10\\n\r\nOne of the things Gundam is best known for are their amazing soundtracks which most of you probably know I never stop raving about XD The openings and endings as well as the OST for this anime were GOD-LIKE.\\n\r\nFor example, these are some of the greatest anime openings ever created IMO:\\n\\n\\n\r\n[video=youtube;akH8OQY0OxI]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akH8OQY0OxI[/video]\\n\\n\r\n[video=youtube;xChqT5_o50o]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xChqT5_o50o[/video]\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nDownload OST Here!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe thing that drew me to this anime the most was the HD art! Don't believe me? Just look at those OP's above!\\n\r\nThose stunning visuals are B-E-A-UTIFUL. The art is so.. so... sleek. All of the characters have defining features and the Gundams are all amazing So much detail!! I can't even imagine how much work they put into this anime. Both the males and females were very pleasing to watch. I heard that almost the entire staff of Sunrise was used in this anime's development. And the end result is just amazing. This is exactly what happens when a bunch of talented people team up to create a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nEvery single episode was so addicting and left a great impression on me, all the way up to the end. Just to let you guys know, I started this anime and then watched non-stop until the end of Season 2. That's how addicting.\\n\r\n(Season 2, HUGE plot twists) Every single damn thing in this anime was amazing. There's literally nothing one could complain about. Every person I know who's seen this has loved it as much as I do. It's always a great experience to witness a true anime masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL RATE: 50/50 (10/10 on MAL)\\n\r\nYes, a perfect score. As you might know already (or perhaps not) all I only rate an anime 10/10 on MAL if I consider it a must-see, or if it blew my mid the whole way through. If you can sit through some politics, enjoy having your morals questioned and are willing to keep an open mind, it's a fantastic series and I recommend it. If the amazing artwork doesn't draw you in, the story and characters will. Even if you want to pay no heed to the story, the stunning visuals during battles are worth watching on their own. Very rarely is there a wasted moment in the show, spare one recap episode told from a different character's perspective. I can't possibly recommend this series more highly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nReccomendations:\\n\\n\r\n- Gundam 00 S2 -\\n\r\nObviously watch the sequal after S1!! It's a rare occurence when the second season is just as good, if not better, than the first! O.O\\n\\n\r\n- Code;Geass -\\n\r\nThe way Celestial Being acted as peacekeepers and believing in absolute justice and the way they excecuted thier missions really reminded me of Code;Geass, also the heirachy of power.... is a thing to watch for ;D\\n\\n\r\n- Mobile Suit Gundam SEED -\\n\r\nThe anime which led me to this one. It's a very hard decision for me to choose which Gundam series I enjoyed more so... why not both? I reccomend Gundam SEED if you liked 00, because they're quite similar in the fact that the art, characters, music, and story were both on the \"god-like\" level. Ingenious.... masterpiece... Finding words to praise both these anime is really quite difficult XD",

            "content": "Another show with slow early progress, things start getting interesting when the 3 nations start to fight back. It may be a pretty mecha-war anime but it really tells us the importance of understanding among each other, how important communication really is. A lot of conflicts can really be avoided if people really try to understand each other. The story progress is somehow slow is the early few eps but after awhile it would be good. Storyline wise is somehow typical but quite tension too as they proceed =)\r\nWorth watching from sunrise.",

            "content": "Now obviously Gundam 00 is another incarnation of the Gundam metafranchise but with a much bigger budget for the animation and cast of course.\r\nStory- It's already in the summary description \r\nCharacter- Ah yes the characters.... now im ok with the characters but what frustrates me is that the show doesnt do the characters any justice by giving any development for the characters. For example in the show a character seems to develop but by the next episode it switches to story mode without developing the characters in the story itself.\r\nSound- I was actually quite surprised. The songs and background music actually have some pretty goodsongs which im actually gonna recommend listening to though of course its not as memorable as other gundam songs but its still really good to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nanimation- Wow... For a gundam show this show is very well animated considering Sunrise is known to rehash scenes in Gundam shows to save time and money but this show... Sunrise really gave it their all for this show because there isnt a single reused scene except for certain gundam moments but no rehashes and no cuts and corners. so i just gotta give Sunrise some credit for this part.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion- All in all this gundam show was an interesting ride for me but i cant put it on my top ten anime list but thats just me. Now for others they might say that  this show is the best gundam now and i cant argue with that since its their opinions but i will say this and that is that perhaps people who have never actually seen a gundam show might love this while some older gundam fans such as myself might not like it. So i cant recommend this gundam show too much but just give maybe the first 5 episodes a try and see if youll either love it or hate.",
