This is the only word I can describe this anime with.\r\nYes, it's reverse harem made from otome game, so you shouldn't expect much from it, but it fails even the lowest expectations.\r\nThe premise is nothing new, but it seems they haven't even tried to make something out of it. Even the bad guys are a common set (and not the best one) that you'd see in any other anime. We have an aloof five year old blonde girl that acts like she's fifty. Eye patch guy, megane guy with creepy attitude and a busty bombshell that everyone's drooling over. You can make a listof tropes out of it.\\n\\n\r\nI saw a lot of reverse harem anime. No scratch that, I had a short period of being obsessed with them so I tried them all. There were really bad ones (Starry sky) and the ones I actually like very much (Hakouoki). Hiiro no kakera is just a bore, it's not bad, not good, there's simply nothing of interest.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I really hated their use of 3D in making those forest spirits - looks seriously out of place.",

            "content": "This is my first review, so bare with me please. This will be based on the first 6 episodes released so far.\r\nHiiro no Karera got my attention when it came out. It is a reverse harem, so you would say it's more for the ladies than the gentlemen. Consisting of 26 episodes in total, the story is really slow paced. Though, I'm a big sucker for reverse harem anime. Just to start off, this anime is based off an otome game (\"An otome game (\u4e59\u5973\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0 otome g\u0113mu, lit. Maiden Game?) is a video game that is targeted towards a female market\")\r\nThe main heroine is onedamsel in distress. Tamaki is a descendant of the \"Tamayori Princess\" who possesses great power, but through out the six episodes released, there's not much power in there yet. Who knows when she'll get her powers when there's 26 episodes?\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10. If you do not like slow paced anime, I would not recommend it. The action of the anime is really slow, but the fight scenes are really well done. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10. Yes, the monsters pretty much looks dull if you watched the first episode, but the fight scenes are well made. I wouldn't compare it to a Fate/Zero or a Fate/Stay Night fight scene, but it is kinda close to it. There's a lot of details! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10. They all have different personalities, plus the characters are also well drawn. You may find the main heroine a bit tad annoying though... It does seems that later on, the anime will have some kind of romance. Because let's face it...there's like 5 men and one lady. \\n\\n\r\nSo far, I am enjoying the anime. I do agree that the first episode was a bit disappointing, but I forced myself to watch the second episode. If you liked reverse harem like Neo Angelique, you might like this anime too. People would say this anime is for female, but I do say that the guys would enjoy the anime too. \\n\\n\r\nEDIT //\\n\r\nI've come to love the music of this anime after watching the 11 episodes that are released now. The other reviews for this anime are pretty right. The anime is REALLY slow, but it seems to get better. They could develop it faster, but I feel like if they did, the anime would only be like 12 episodes and really fast paced.",

            "content": "Making an anime based off a visual novel is never easy especially one aimed at a specific target audience, or in this case, the female market. There could be mistakes through adaption, the delivering of the characters, or in other cases, not sticking with the story. There is much to be said regarding what can make an extravagent series out of a visual novel these days especially from a series a game that is not too well known compared to some of the more popular series like FSN, Higurashi, etc. Will Hiiro no Kakera carry out the task of getting through the right audience anddeliver a series worth to talk about?\\n\\n\r\n\tHiiro no Kakera (also known as Scarlet Fragment) details the story of a young girl named Tamaki who had a peaceful life till one day she learns about the true extents of her origin and family. Expect the unexpected, right? But more than that, there are five other gorgeous guys that accompanies her and protects Tamaki as she is the next Tamayorihime, or the princess after her grandmother. The story goes on from there where her original peaceful life gets thrown into turmoil when other malevolent forces are after her and the secrets that lies with her past.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Story 5/10\\n\r\nI'll be honest here. This story has not impressed me as much as I originally hoped. At first glance, it seems to contain a lot of action packed fighting just based on the OP. However, the story flows a bit slow and replaced with rather heavy dialogue relating to protection, secrets, and artifacts. Speaking of artifacts, it is obvious that others would also want them. With one fragile girl and five handsome looking guys looking out for her, this story may seem compelling to fans who are into bachelors and that sort of genre. Unfortunately for me though, that's not my case. But of course, it's based off an otome game and it's aimed at the female market. \\n\\n\r\n+ Art 8/10\\n\r\nIf there is one thing out there about this anime that impressed me so far, it would be the artwork. When it comes to artwork for this series, it is done quite beautifully and probably one of the more stand out points. As much as I despise Studio Deen for some of their previous work, the art is beautiful and more realistic. \\n\\n\r\n+ Sound 7/10\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the sound of this series is fluid and occasionally catchy. The OP song \u201cNee\u201d performed by Fujita Maiko is relaxing and who doesn't want to listen to some relaxing music when waking up on Sundays? \\n\\n\r\n+ Character 5/10\\n\r\nThere seems to be something I'm missing here. The main girl gets off a bus and gets protected by a hot guy. But, what kind of connections do they have? Oh but not only that, there are four (well, one later in the story) guys that just pops out into the story with little background so far. As for our antagonists of the story, they are all represented by German numbers. Now, is that significant? The fact that they are after a certain object seems to put them on the bad side of the \"good guys\" so far. With little to no background of what the characters are like so far in the series, my point of characters stand out as a disappointment.\\n\\n\r\n+ Enjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nOverall, this series is nothing special and not something that I consider the hit of this Spring Season. It might even be worth a drop or an on-hold as a matter of fact. The story is slow and dialogue heavy not helping by the fact of the almost obscure character backgrounds. However, if you're the target of the demographic that the series is being aimed at, then the bulls eye might be hit. The various endings of nearly episode (that I found somewhat disturbing after awhile) may be pleasing to the eyes of a female viewer. Additionally, the fact that the series is labeled with \u201cromance\u201d might bring out your \u201cinner fangirl\u201d. Unfortunately, it's not working for me. However, this could be a pleasing gift to give on Christmas or on Valentine to your girlfriend that are into the bachelor sort of background.\\n",

They throw hints of mystery and character ties that never get answered. The main characters are constantly complaining about their lives. The heroine is annoying. The characters are forgettable.

            "content": "I am reminded of the Anime called \u201cAsura Cryin'\u201d. The first season came out in April of 2009 and the second came out in October of 2009.  The first season of the Anime actually shares a lot of the problems that \u201cHiiro No Kakera\u201d happens to have. One of the problems happens to be the fact there were signs that the series had potential but the whole first season falls flat. \r\nHowever, the second season ended up giving those of us who gave it a chance a pleasant surprise. Similarly \u201cHiiro No Kakera\u201d has the same potential to possibly wow people with the secondseason that is supposed to come in October. Of course, it also has the chance of falling flat. Even if the second season turns out to be a pleasant surprise the question of whether or not watching the first season just to watch the second is going to come up.\\n\\n\r\nThe unfortunate fact is, while \u201cHiirro No Kakera\u201d shares a lot of the same problems, the problems are more evident then they were in \u201cAsura Cryin\u201d.  First, \u201cHiirro No Kakera\u201d has only two episodes (the first and the last) that draw the viewer in without the use of bishonen to drool over. The rest of the episodes fall flat in their story telling. There was a lot of material that could have easily been condensed and the story line would have still not had a rushed feeling to it.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, in the first episode you are introduced to a heroine who is mistaken for being clumsy but really isn't. She's weak, but that is because she's never had training for her abilities like the five males. One would think there would be great potential but what I was looking for didn't show up until the last episode. Instead, we were treated to episode after episode of her having angst fits about how she can't do anything.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, don't be surprised to see this heroine compared to Bella Swan even if the second season is well done. Some people may call her out for having a fake fatal flaw of clumsiness because she is called out for being clumsy in the first episode. This is despite the fact she really did simply misstep like many other people would have done. And lets not forget the constant angst we got from this character and the fact she's likely to be paired with the bad boy of the group. Yup... she may be called a Mary Sue even though she may not be one. \\n\\n\r\nI'm honestly holding out until second season before I judge her on this regard... if there is a second season. I'm not saying I don't want a second season here, I don't like it when series are stopped in the middle and big plot holes are left. Thankfully too it seems they have the other episodes done already. However, I'm also not sure how well this Anime is going to go over. They can always change their mind if they don't make a profit off of the first seasons DVD sales to recoup the cost for creating the DVDs.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, the music is beautiful. The voice acting... not so much. It also grated on my nerves at times. Even if these voice actors have good roles, this just isn't their best. Far from it. Hands down, for those who have NOT picked up the first season yet, I suggest waiting at least until the second season comes out and reading some of the reviews for that, that of course don't gush about the bishonen. Even then... you may want to consider using a wiki to get the information necessary from the first season to watch the second. This was rather painful to watch, and I say this having enjoyed the first and last episodes.",

Forget it, those anime are a whole different level in enjoyment. \r\nStory:\r\nA girl moves to the countryside, to her grandmother. The family is very traditional and strict, so the girl who can see Youkais and all kind of spirits must succeed the grandmother as the princess of her clan. This traditional family is backed and supported by more conservative family's from the village. The tradition says shehas to have bodyguards for her protection, those come from said conservative families. Those guys are all her age and visit the same school as her.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis is a weak point. Its an old style anime, which is disappointing, because in the genre of Yokais you want to see beautiful pictures like in Natsume or in Mushishi. Personally I dont like the artwork, I think its somehow flat, the main protagonist seems very boring (Looks like a boring version of Kaori in X-Clamp). The scenery  seems very heavy and dark, which is bad cause it makes the story even worse.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNot much to say, there hasn't been any special piece of music yet.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis is a weak point.  The main protagonist is your average boring Japanese girl. The characters aren't well defined. They all are very traditional conservative people. Also the reaction of the characters is too reserved for me above all form the main protagonist, if you consider her whole life has changed and that she  all of a sudden was forced by the circumstances  to move to her grandmother and not enough, that additionally she has to take over the role of the princess of the clan in a very cold household, you would expect her to have some emotional reaction. (I mean she is a teenager..) ...The others characters are the bodyguards which are also her schoolmates, one guy is always in bad mood and the other one looks younger than he is.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nEither an Anime  focuses on battles, or on some critical issue or on the characters, or it is just a good-vibe Anime like Mushishi and Natsume, but this Anime fails, it is a \"boringvibe\" Anime. The battles are short, the Youkais aren't explained well, I don't think the Anime has any political or emotional message and above all for me the artwork fails, so whats left?  The story, I think the story could be somewhat interesting, but so far the execution is very bad. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI don't recommend this show.",

Don't get me wrong, some of it was really promising, but other things just seemed so boring and bland that it could ruin the whole show. The art is beautfiul (I would almost watch it for that alone), but that's why I was confused when these overly simplistic \"monster\" ghosts came out. I have no idea what was going on there; a child could have drawn them. But all of the other art, like I said, isA+. The soundtrack is pleasant and their choice of voice characters works well. The story line is pretty interesting, but the characters are what bore me--they're pretty stereotypical and hard to relate to. While the manga was a shojo, I think the anime appeals to men, women, and everyone inbetween.  I would recommend watching the first episode and deciding what you think of it for yourself. The show is kind of a mixed bag right now.",

            "content": "The anime begins with Tamaki in a god awful outfit going to her grandmothers maybe to cater to the little red riding hood fans, upon walking into the forest things happen and she meets Takuma. Who then begins to trash talks her when she meets him and is the moodiest in the bunch so he is the love interest (Fushigi Yugi, Neo Angelique).\r\nWe then go to her grandmothers and everyone in or around the general vicinity may as well wear designer suits and Italian shoes and call themselves the mafia as they all appear just as shifty. Tamaki then meets her grandmother who lives ina large house surrounded by young people serving her every need, Tamaki must have forgotten that about her last visit I am guessing. Her grandmother then tells her she is the Tamayori Princess and she must protect the Onikirimaru and she has five guardians, and doesn\u2019t feel the need to explain anything else. Who doesn\u2019t love surprises?\\n\\n\r\nTamaki then meets the rest of her crew, suspicious long haired nice man Suguru, Loud mouth angry man Mahiro, emotionless sleepy man Yuuichi, pushover overly nice cute type man Shinji.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes are full of fillers of Tamaki\u2019s feelings and what the hell am I meant to do ness and battle plans repeated a few times to make sure you the viewer are dead certain as to what is going to happen the next few episodes. It could all be made easier if Tamaki\u2019s grandmother shared the fountain of knowledge as she was once the Tamayori Princess she must have a cheat sheet to give, or she just likes putting the world at risk for the entertainment factor.\\n\r\nThe bad guys the Logo\u2019s with leading lady Aria along with the so originally named Eins, Zwei, Drei and Vier. Who apparently want the Onikirimaru for something and are stealing all the jewelry like crazed magpies or so it is made out, a few episodes in Aria\u2019s paranoia about her team not obeying her commands comes to light and they just stop doing anything but sit in their mansion while Aria asks bum chest Vier to do some background checks.\\n\\n\r\nWhile all that is happening there is a man on the phone eating food constantly and keeping watch on what the two teams and what they\u2019re not doing. Ryou is sniffing everyone because a pet fox was not enough. There is also the so damn obvious Fiona Sensei running about the school they all conveniently go to and spying on conversations. Spoiler alert she is Vier, though I would question those who did not guess that.\\n\\n\r\nI feel as if there is little I can say about the art style of the anime other than eyes and eyebrows do not grow over your hair and  CGI should not be included in anime unless the anime consists of being made entirely from CGI. When the battles do not include CGI they are quite impressive and they keep you hooked to your screen and stays away from cliches.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this anime is probably one of my favorites from anime this year with the opening song being incredibly catchy and well sung.It is not an opening you skip just to get to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nYou will like the anime if you are into slow story flow and being told as little as possible for as long as possible or you are a big fan of the reverse harem genre and having a slight fantasy setting and have ran out of the good ones to keep you entertained. The music will draw you into watching and if you\u2019re like me the CGI blobs in the beginning will quickly chase you out again along with the predictable characters, but if you stick with it you will see some impressive fight scenes and some laughable moments.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nArt: 2\\n\r\nMusic: 8\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nOverall: 5",

Then Team Evil monologues a bit and sets up a date to battle over the second relic with the promise that if the protagonists dare to show up they will all be killed and forgotten.  Much posturing and flexing of manly muscles on the part of the wonderboys of Team Good in the episodes meandering along towards the second confrontation.  Fight #2 arrives and ... Team Good is completely crushed again.  Team Evil loses only a couple of hitpoints while Team Good is utterly wrecked.  I can only assume that they cut all their real players and has been making do by sending in the cheer squad.  Despite the earlier promise to dispose of Team Good, another promise is made to set up a date for a fight over the third relic with the usual menace of \"If they impede us again, we'll dispose of them\" weakly countered by \"when we meet again, I will not lose.\"  Riiiiight.  Heard THAT before.\\n\\n\r\nThere was enough foreshadowing around the Prime Protagonist having some variety of unawakened power that I expect at some crucial moment she'll finally hit three sevens on the Ultimate Power slot machine and jackpot her team to victory.  Which leads me to wonder why the heck Team Evil is even bothering to give them that many chances.  Leader Loli ought to let her players go pick up the other two relics and jet.  Sure they haven't yet figured out what to do with them but take custody of 'em and figure it out their leisure.  Bah.",

I get that they were trying to follow the game  style but visually, it didn't stand out much.\r\nSound: Appropriate OST and sound FX, but not worth looking up any particular song.\r\nCharacters: \r\nteenaged girl visits/moves in with her Grandmother only to find out that she's a princess with hidden magical powers and has hot bodyguards but in typical anime fashion, she'skind of clueless and gullible but nonetheless we're supposed to believe that she can save the world or something. The villains don't really have a purpose other than to annoy the mains, I didn't care much for them. Grandma gets 0 points, she wasn't useless to the story but she wasn't exactly helpful either.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nFound myself wanting to skip episodes but somehow managed to get through it because, well, i was more than halfway done and had all of the episodes downloaded already. \\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI'd recommend this to the younger generation, like 10-14 yr olds to be quite honest. I had never heard of it before but I was really into reverse harem and this was at the top of everyone's list and I'm not sure why. It's a bit predictable/clich\u00e9 and after about 8 episodes I found myself skimming the episodes instead of watching them all the way through just to finish it and by the end of it, I didn't even want to start season 2. \\n\r\nWould I watch it again?

            "content": "Everyone knows of at least one anime that had the potential to be great, but instead it became a pile of crap, wasting all or most of the potential it had. Well Hiiro no Kakera is yet another title you can add to the list of shows that had potential, but wasted it.\r\nHiiro no Kakera is an adaption of a bunch of popular otome games that currently remain only in Japan. Adapted by Studio DEEN, who can do plenty wrong, you can guess it's them adapting the games improperly that led to this.\r\nThe show starts out with a girl named Tamaki finding out she isto become the Tamayori Princess that takes place after an encounter with a weird creature she can see. However the thing is, the show doesn't bother explaining much about what the Tamayori Princess is, or anything else after this happens, which is where the cracks start to show. Events just happen thanks to this, and seem like complete nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nThe show later soon throws in the guardians into the playing field, and they don't bother developing them much either. By episode 2, the entire cast is together (A bunch of guys that remind you of the vampires that were around Yuki from Vampire Knight-also by DEEN), and they make it seem like all the characters have known each other for a very long time, and have been fighting battles to protect the artifacts (Another thing they don't bother explaining) from the Logos for just as long which shows even more cracks. They don't bother explaining what their goal is, or why all this is happening which makes getting engaged in the story to be quite tough.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is quite erratic. Early on in the show, they just throw the characters in, but later on in the show they attempt to develop a few characters (Especially Takuma in the final few episodes) a bit instead of just making them poof out of nowhere. This helps improve things, but the cracks are already so deep, it's completely impossible to fix them.\\n\\n\r\nAnother example of erratic character development is one moment in the show Tamaki suggests the characters talk to each and get to know each other to help in their battle with the Logos, but this doesn't come to pass as they skip this much needed development completely, which completely dashes your hopes about this show. It just shows Studio DEEN is relying on soley the pretty guys and artwork to make this a hit with fujoshi (It should be noted, the show has already bombed in Japan). This is already evident when every episode ends with those brief scenes trying to show off the guys of the show after the credits are done.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation are the show's strongest suit, and everything looks beautiful, especially during the battles with Logos where DEEN steps their game up, but the unfortunate thing is they put in more work into the art and animation (Especially on the male characters-again fujoshi-bait) than everything else which spells nothing but trouble. The artwork in the end becomes pretty much one of the only reasons to keep watching.\\n\\n\r\nAccompanied by the art and animation is of course the soundtrack, and it just works. Nothing too special, but it fits the mood, especially the music during the battles. It helps make a show that is already tough to enjoy due to it's many flaws in storytelling and character development enjoyable at times.\\n\\n\r\nNow I haven't played the games, so I can't confirm how good or badly DEEN adapted them, but as I've heard from those that played the games, they got nearly everything wrong, which doesn't surprise me as I've heard DEEN has done a ton of other things wrong, and I've seen many of these things for myself. Going by the poor and erratic storytelling and character development, them adapting the games wrong is probably true. I just can't imagine the original source material having all these facepalming flaws.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Hiiro no Kakera can be an enjoyable show if you don't take it too seriously, you just want to stare at beautiful art, and you're not expecting something like Vampire Knight. It was a show that had the potential to be great, but it was wasted due Studio DEEN messing up yet again and putting too much work into the character designs, the art, and the animation than the more important stuff such as the character development and story. I can only wonder how bad the second half of the show is going to turn out when it premiers this Fall.",

            "content": "Ok, first ever review so sorry if it's a bit useless \u00ac_\u00ac\r\nStory:\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed the storyline. It may have been a little slow-paced but I enjoyed the slow development. There are a few twists and some mystery involved in the story line, although some of it can be pretty predictable. I found it very interesting the way things turned out and there are some exciting events, however the first half of the series can get a bit irratating at times but I thought it was definetly worth it.\r\nArt:\r\nI LOVE the way the characters and scenery is drawn! Everything looked beautiful but not over exaggerated. Iam especially fond of the way the characters are drawn. Emotions are conveyed efficiently through the art which creates a more emotive feeling. The only slight down side is the way the gods are drawn. In the first episode the gods are basically uncreative blobs but further into the series more interesting gods/demons are introduced.\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music for the opening is stunning. I absolutely adore it! The sound used throughout the series consistently fitted with the scene and helped to create more vivid and emotive moments. Perfect.\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThere is a lot of development in many of the characters, particularly the guardians. They start off having very distinct characteristics which are individually likeable but also have some ideas and feelings that are quite negative. We see them all go from feeling one way to another, which sounds vague but I'm trying not to spoil it! I especially liked Mahiro-Senapi, he was funny throughout and is interaction with the others was always amusing. The guardians also have more serious sides and it's good to see well-rounded, realistic characters. Tamaki annoyed me a little because it took her a while to get into her role as the Tamayori princess but once she got her act together a bit more she was ok. I also really liked Mitsuru-chan, she was sweet and lovely and her character never failed to make me smile. \\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI loved this anime! I watched the first episode but I must admit I wasn't immediately hooked, I waited a whole week before deciding to try another episode and I'm glad I did. The first episode is pretty average but I promise the rest of the series was much more enjoyable! It was nice to see them all forming friendships and the romance between a certain two characters was highly engaging.. I would reccomend you watch this anime NOW! :)",

Which I enjoy a lot because fall is my favourite season. To all the characters in which every male harem I seen I  feel some male characters overshadow others, while this one just blend together with the female character. Which is other great fact is lead female character didn't get overshadow either, in fact it was focus on her and her journey. One key ingredient for me to love the show, is me wanting more. I trylooking up see it's manga series and sadly there not big series. \\n\r\nI think others will love this series, for the journey each character takes and how they work as kinda of mishap family, and the opening music will make you want to learn more about the story.",

Even the bad guys are a common set (and not the best one) that you'd see in any other anime. We have an aloof five year old blonde girl that acts like she's fifty. Eye patch guy, megane guy with creepy attitude and a busty bombshell that everyone's drooling over. You can make a listof tropes out of it.\\n\\n\r\nI saw a lot of reverse harem anime. No scratch that, I had a short period of being obsessed with them so I tried them all. There were really bad ones (Starry sky) and the ones I actually like very much (Hakouoki). Hiiro no kakera is just a bore, it's not bad, not good, there's simply nothing of interest.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I really hated their use of 3D in making those forest spirits - looks seriously out of place.",

            "content": "This is my first review, so bare with me please. This will be based on the first 6 episodes released so far.\r\nHiiro no Karera got my attention when it came out. It is a reverse harem, so you would say it's more for the ladies than the gentlemen. Consisting of 26 episodes in total, the story is really slow paced. Though, I'm a big sucker for reverse harem anime. Just to start off, this anime is based off an otome game (\"An otome game (\u4e59\u5973\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0 otome g\u0113mu, lit. Maiden Game?) is a video game that is targeted towards a female market\")\r\nThe main heroine is onedamsel in distress. Tamaki is a descendant of the \"Tamayori Princess\" who possesses great power, but through out the six episodes released, there's not much power in there yet. Who knows when she'll get her powers when there's 26 episodes?\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10. If you do not like slow paced anime, I would not recommend it. The action of the anime is really slow, but the fight scenes are really well done. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10. Yes, the monsters pretty much looks dull if you watched the first episode, but the fight scenes are well made. I wouldn't compare it to a Fate/Zero or a Fate/Stay Night fight scene, but it is kinda close to it. There's a lot of details! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10. They all have different personalities, plus the characters are also well drawn. You may find the main heroine a bit tad annoying though... It does seems that later on, the anime will have some kind of romance. Because let's face it...there's like 5 men and one lady. \\n\\n\r\nSo far, I am enjoying the anime. I do agree that the first episode was a bit disappointing, but I forced myself to watch the second episode. If you liked reverse harem like Neo Angelique, you might like this anime too. People would say this anime is for female, but I do say that the guys would enjoy the anime too. \\n\\n\r\nEDIT //\\n\r\nI've come to love the music of this anime after watching the 11 episodes that are released now. The other reviews for this anime are pretty right. The anime is REALLY slow, but it seems to get better. They could develop it faster, but I feel like if they did, the anime would only be like 12 episodes and really fast paced.",

            "content": "Making an anime based off a visual novel is never easy especially one aimed at a specific target audience, or in this case, the female market. There could be mistakes through adaption, the delivering of the characters, or in other cases, not sticking with the story. There is much to be said regarding what can make an extravagent series out of a visual novel these days especially from a series a game that is not too well known compared to some of the more popular series like FSN, Higurashi, etc. Will Hiiro no Kakera carry out the task of getting through the right audience anddeliver a series worth to talk about?\\n\\n\r\n\tHiiro no Kakera (also known as Scarlet Fragment) details the story of a young girl named Tamaki who had a peaceful life till one day she learns about the true extents of her origin and family. Expect the unexpected, right? But more than that, there are five other gorgeous guys that accompanies her and protects Tamaki as she is the next Tamayorihime, or the princess after her grandmother. The story goes on from there where her original peaceful life gets thrown into turmoil when other malevolent forces are after her and the secrets that lies with her past.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Story 5/10\\n\r\nI'll be honest here. This story has not impressed me as much as I originally hoped. At first glance, it seems to contain a lot of action packed fighting just based on the OP. However, the story flows a bit slow and replaced with rather heavy dialogue relating to protection, secrets, and artifacts. Speaking of artifacts, it is obvious that others would also want them. With one fragile girl and five handsome looking guys looking out for her, this story may seem compelling to fans who are into bachelors and that sort of genre. Unfortunately for me though, that's not my case. But of course, it's based off an otome game and it's aimed at the female market. \\n\\n\r\n+ Art 8/10\\n\r\nIf there is one thing out there about this anime that impressed me so far, it would be the artwork. When it comes to artwork for this series, it is done quite beautifully and probably one of the more stand out points. As much as I despise Studio Deen for some of their previous work, the art is beautiful and more realistic. \\n\\n\r\n+ Sound 7/10\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the sound of this series is fluid and occasionally catchy. The OP song \u201cNee\u201d performed by Fujita Maiko is relaxing and who doesn't want to listen to some relaxing music when waking up on Sundays? \\n\\n\r\n+ Character 5/10\\n\r\nThere seems to be something I'm missing here. The main girl gets off a bus and gets protected by a hot guy. But, what kind of connections do they have? Oh but not only that, there are four (well, one later in the story) guys that just pops out into the story with little background so far. As for our antagonists of the story, they are all represented by German numbers. Now, is that significant? The fact that they are after a certain object seems to put them on the bad side of the \"good guys\" so far. With little to no background of what the characters are like so far in the series, my point of characters stand out as a disappointment.\\n\\n\r\n+ Enjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nOverall, this series is nothing special and not something that I consider the hit of this Spring Season. It might even be worth a drop or an on-hold as a matter of fact. The story is slow and dialogue heavy not helping by the fact of the almost obscure character backgrounds. However, if you're the target of the demographic that the series is being aimed at, then the bulls eye might be hit. The various endings of nearly episode (that I found somewhat disturbing after awhile) may be pleasing to the eyes of a female viewer. Additionally, the fact that the series is labeled with \u201cromance\u201d might bring out your \u201cinner fangirl\u201d. Unfortunately, it's not working for me. However, this could be a pleasing gift to give on Christmas or on Valentine to your girlfriend that are into the bachelor sort of background.\\n",

            "content": "I am reminded of the Anime called \u201cAsura Cryin'\u201d. The first season came out in April of 2009 and the second came out in October of 2009.  The first season of the Anime actually shares a lot of the problems that \u201cHiiro No Kakera\u201d happens to have. One of the problems happens to be the fact there were signs that the series had potential but the whole first season falls flat. \r\nHowever, the second season ended up giving those of us who gave it a chance a pleasant surprise. Similarly \u201cHiiro No Kakera\u201d has the same potential to possibly wow people with the secondseason that is supposed to come in October. Of course, it also has the chance of falling flat. Even if the second season turns out to be a pleasant surprise the question of whether or not watching the first season just to watch the second is going to come up.\\n\\n\r\nThe unfortunate fact is, while \u201cHiirro No Kakera\u201d shares a lot of the same problems, the problems are more evident then they were in \u201cAsura Cryin\u201d.  First, \u201cHiirro No Kakera\u201d has only two episodes (the first and the last) that draw the viewer in without the use of bishonen to drool over. The rest of the episodes fall flat in their story telling. There was a lot of material that could have easily been condensed and the story line would have still not had a rushed feeling to it.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, in the first episode you are introduced to a heroine who is mistaken for being clumsy but really isn't. She's weak, but that is because she's never had training for her abilities like the five males. One would think there would be great potential but what I was looking for didn't show up until the last episode. Instead, we were treated to episode after episode of her having angst fits about how she can't do anything.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, don't be surprised to see this heroine compared to Bella Swan even if the second season is well done. Some people may call her out for having a fake fatal flaw of clumsiness because she is called out for being clumsy in the first episode. This is despite the fact she really did simply misstep like many other people would have done. And lets not forget the constant angst we got from this character and the fact she's likely to be paired with the bad boy of the group. Yup... she may be called a Mary Sue even though she may not be one. \\n\\n\r\nI'm honestly holding out until second season before I judge her on this regard... if there is a second season. I'm not saying I don't want a second season here, I don't like it when series are stopped in the middle and big plot holes are left. Thankfully too it seems they have the other episodes done already. However, I'm also not sure how well this Anime is going to go over. They can always change their mind if they don't make a profit off of the first seasons DVD sales to recoup the cost for creating the DVDs.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, the music is beautiful. The voice acting... not so much. It also grated on my nerves at times. Even if these voice actors have good roles, this just isn't their best. Far from it. Hands down, for those who have NOT picked up the first season yet, I suggest waiting at least until the second season comes out and reading some of the reviews for that, that of course don't gush about the bishonen. Even then... you may want to consider using a wiki to get the information necessary from the first season to watch the second. This was rather painful to watch, and I say this having enjoyed the first and last episodes.",

            "content": "Did you expect something great like Natsume Yuujinchou, which is also about a person who can see Yokais and moves to the countryside. Or maybe something like Mushishi a guy travels around and sees Yokais and spiritual stuff. Forget it, those anime are a whole different level in enjoyment. \r\nStory:\r\nA girl moves to the countryside, to her grandmother. The family is very traditional and strict, so the girl who can see Youkais and all kind of spirits must succeed the grandmother as the princess of her clan. This traditional family is backed and supported by more conservative family's from the village. The tradition says shehas to have bodyguards for her protection, those come from said conservative families. Those guys are all her age and visit the same school as her.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis is a weak point. Its an old style anime, which is disappointing, because in the genre of Yokais you want to see beautiful pictures like in Natsume or in Mushishi. Personally I dont like the artwork, I think its somehow flat, the main protagonist seems very boring (Looks like a boring version of Kaori in X-Clamp). The scenery  seems very heavy and dark, which is bad cause it makes the story even worse.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNot much to say, there hasn't been any special piece of music yet.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis is a weak point.  The main protagonist is your average boring Japanese girl. The characters aren't well defined. They all are very traditional conservative people. Also the reaction of the characters is too reserved for me above all form the main protagonist, if you consider her whole life has changed and that she  all of a sudden was forced by the circumstances  to move to her grandmother and not enough, that additionally she has to take over the role of the princess of the clan in a very cold household, you would expect her to have some emotional reaction. (I mean she is a teenager..) ...The others characters are the bodyguards which are also her schoolmates, one guy is always in bad mood and the other one looks younger than he is.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nEither an Anime  focuses on battles, or on some critical issue or on the characters, or it is just a good-vibe Anime like Mushishi and Natsume, but this Anime fails, it is a \"boringvibe\" Anime. The battles are short, the Youkais aren't explained well, I don't think the Anime has any political or emotional message and above all for me the artwork fails, so whats left?  The story, I think the story could be somewhat interesting, but so far the execution is very bad. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI don't recommend this show.",

Don't get me wrong, some of it was really promising, but other things just seemed so boring and bland that it could ruin the whole show. The art is beautfiul (I would almost watch it for that alone), but that's why I was confused when these overly simplistic \"monster\" ghosts came out. I have no idea what was going on there; a child could have drawn them. But all of the other art, like I said, isA+. The soundtrack is pleasant and their choice of voice characters works well. The story line is pretty interesting, but the characters are what bore me--they're pretty stereotypical and hard to relate to. While the manga was a shojo, I think the anime appeals to men, women, and everyone inbetween.  I would recommend watching the first episode and deciding what you think of it for yourself. The show is kind of a mixed bag right now.",

            "content": "The anime begins with Tamaki in a god awful outfit going to her grandmothers maybe to cater to the little red riding hood fans, upon walking into the forest things happen and she meets Takuma. Who then begins to trash talks her when she meets him and is the moodiest in the bunch so he is the love interest (Fushigi Yugi, Neo Angelique).\r\nWe then go to her grandmothers and everyone in or around the general vicinity may as well wear designer suits and Italian shoes and call themselves the mafia as they all appear just as shifty. Tamaki then meets her grandmother who lives ina large house surrounded by young people serving her every need, Tamaki must have forgotten that about her last visit I am guessing. Her grandmother then tells her she is the Tamayori Princess and she must protect the Onikirimaru and she has five guardians, and doesn\u2019t feel the need to explain anything else. Who doesn\u2019t love surprises?\\n\\n\r\nTamaki then meets the rest of her crew, suspicious long haired nice man Suguru, Loud mouth angry man Mahiro, emotionless sleepy man Yuuichi, pushover overly nice cute type man Shinji.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes are full of fillers of Tamaki\u2019s feelings and what the hell am I meant to do ness and battle plans repeated a few times to make sure you the viewer are dead certain as to what is going to happen the next few episodes. It could all be made easier if Tamaki\u2019s grandmother shared the fountain of knowledge as she was once the Tamayori Princess she must have a cheat sheet to give, or she just likes putting the world at risk for the entertainment factor.\\n\r\nThe bad guys the Logo\u2019s with leading lady Aria along with the so originally named Eins, Zwei, Drei and Vier. Who apparently want the Onikirimaru for something and are stealing all the jewelry like crazed magpies or so it is made out, a few episodes in Aria\u2019s paranoia about her team not obeying her commands comes to light and they just stop doing anything but sit in their mansion while Aria asks bum chest Vier to do some background checks.\\n\\n\r\nWhile all that is happening there is a man on the phone eating food constantly and keeping watch on what the two teams and what they\u2019re not doing. Ryou is sniffing everyone because a pet fox was not enough. There is also the so damn obvious Fiona Sensei running about the school they all conveniently go to and spying on conversations. Spoiler alert she is Vier, though I would question those who did not guess that.\\n\\n\r\nI feel as if there is little I can say about the art style of the anime other than eyes and eyebrows do not grow over your hair and  CGI should not be included in anime unless the anime consists of being made entirely from CGI. When the battles do not include CGI they are quite impressive and they keep you hooked to your screen and stays away from cliches.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this anime is probably one of my favorites from anime this year with the opening song being incredibly catchy and well sung.It is not an opening you skip just to get to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nYou will like the anime if you are into slow story flow and being told as little as possible for as long as possible or you are a big fan of the reverse harem genre and having a slight fantasy setting and have ran out of the good ones to keep you entertained. The music will draw you into watching and if you\u2019re like me the CGI blobs in the beginning will quickly chase you out again along with the predictable characters, but if you stick with it you will see some impressive fight scenes and some laughable moments.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nArt: 2\\n\r\nMusic: 8\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nOverall: 5",

Then Team Evil monologues a bit and sets up a date to battle over the second relic with the promise that if the protagonists dare to show up they will all be killed and forgotten.  Much posturing and flexing of manly muscles on the part of the wonderboys of Team Good in the episodes meandering along towards the second confrontation.  Fight #2 arrives and ... Team Good is completely crushed again.  Team Evil loses only a couple of hitpoints while Team Good is utterly wrecked.  I can only assume that they cut all their real players and has been making do by sending in the cheer squad.  Despite the earlier promise to dispose of Team Good, another promise is made to set up a date for a fight over the third relic with the usual menace of \"If they impede us again, we'll dispose of them\" weakly countered by \"when we meet again, I will not lose.\"  Riiiiight.  Heard THAT before.\\n\\n\r\nThere was enough foreshadowing around the Prime Protagonist having some variety of unawakened power that I expect at some crucial moment she'll finally hit three sevens on the Ultimate Power slot machine and jackpot her team to victory.  Which leads me to wonder why the heck Team Evil is even bothering to give them that many chances.  Leader Loli ought to let her players go pick up the other two relics and jet.  Sure they haven't yet figured out what to do with them but take custody of 'em and figure it out their leisure.  Bah.",

            "content": "First review...\r\nStory: \r\nGreat storyline, poor execution; it would've had more potential if the writers focused on like actual soul searching/demon hunting rather than trying to pair the main girl up with every guy there.\r\nArt: \r\nFor an anime made in 2012, it looked early 2000s. I get that they were trying to follow the game  style but visually, it didn't stand out much.\r\nSound: Appropriate OST and sound FX, but not worth looking up any particular song.\r\nCharacters: \r\nteenaged girl visits/moves in with her Grandmother only to find out that she's a princess with hidden magical powers and has hot bodyguards but in typical anime fashion, she'skind of clueless and gullible but nonetheless we're supposed to believe that she can save the world or something. The villains don't really have a purpose other than to annoy the mains, I didn't care much for them. Grandma gets 0 points, she wasn't useless to the story but she wasn't exactly helpful either.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nFound myself wanting to skip episodes but somehow managed to get through it because, well, i was more than halfway done and had all of the episodes downloaded already. \\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI'd recommend this to the younger generation, like 10-14 yr olds to be quite honest. I had never heard of it before but I was really into reverse harem and this was at the top of everyone's list and I'm not sure why. It's a bit predictable/clich\u00e9 and after about 8 episodes I found myself skimming the episodes instead of watching them all the way through just to finish it and by the end of it, I didn't even want to start season 2. \\n\r\nWould I watch it again? No.",

            "content": "Everyone knows of at least one anime that had the potential to be great, but instead it became a pile of crap, wasting all or most of the potential it had. Well Hiiro no Kakera is yet another title you can add to the list of shows that had potential, but wasted it.\r\nHiiro no Kakera is an adaption of a bunch of popular otome games that currently remain only in Japan. Adapted by Studio DEEN, who can do plenty wrong, you can guess it's them adapting the games improperly that led to this.\r\nThe show starts out with a girl named Tamaki finding out she isto become the Tamayori Princess that takes place after an encounter with a weird creature she can see. However the thing is, the show doesn't bother explaining much about what the Tamayori Princess is, or anything else after this happens, which is where the cracks start to show. Events just happen thanks to this, and seem like complete nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nThe show later soon throws in the guardians into the playing field, and they don't bother developing them much either. By episode 2, the entire cast is together (A bunch of guys that remind you of the vampires that were around Yuki from Vampire Knight-also by DEEN), and they make it seem like all the characters have known each other for a very long time, and have been fighting battles to protect the artifacts (Another thing they don't bother explaining) from the Logos for just as long which shows even more cracks. They don't bother explaining what their goal is, or why all this is happening which makes getting engaged in the story to be quite tough.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is quite erratic. Early on in the show, they just throw the characters in, but later on in the show they attempt to develop a few characters (Especially Takuma in the final few episodes) a bit instead of just making them poof out of nowhere. This helps improve things, but the cracks are already so deep, it's completely impossible to fix them.\\n\\n\r\nAnother example of erratic character development is one moment in the show Tamaki suggests the characters talk to each and get to know each other to help in their battle with the Logos, but this doesn't come to pass as they skip this much needed development completely, which completely dashes your hopes about this show. It just shows Studio DEEN is relying on soley the pretty guys and artwork to make this a hit with fujoshi (It should be noted, the show has already bombed in Japan). This is already evident when every episode ends with those brief scenes trying to show off the guys of the show after the credits are done.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation are the show's strongest suit, and everything looks beautiful, especially during the battles with Logos where DEEN steps their game up, but the unfortunate thing is they put in more work into the art and animation (Especially on the male characters-again fujoshi-bait) than everything else which spells nothing but trouble. The artwork in the end becomes pretty much one of the only reasons to keep watching.\\n\\n\r\nAccompanied by the art and animation is of course the soundtrack, and it just works. Nothing too special, but it fits the mood, especially the music during the battles. It helps make a show that is already tough to enjoy due to it's many flaws in storytelling and character development enjoyable at times.\\n\\n\r\nNow I haven't played the games, so I can't confirm how good or badly DEEN adapted them, but as I've heard from those that played the games, they got nearly everything wrong, which doesn't surprise me as I've heard DEEN has done a ton of other things wrong, and I've seen many of these things for myself. Going by the poor and erratic storytelling and character development, them adapting the games wrong is probably true. I just can't imagine the original source material having all these facepalming flaws.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Hiiro no Kakera can be an enjoyable show if you don't take it too seriously, you just want to stare at beautiful art, and you're not expecting something like Vampire Knight. It was a show that had the potential to be great, but it was wasted due Studio DEEN messing up yet again and putting too much work into the character designs, the art, and the animation than the more important stuff such as the character development and story. I can only wonder how bad the second half of the show is going to turn out when it premiers this Fall.",

            "content": "Ok, first ever review so sorry if it's a bit useless \u00ac_\u00ac\r\nStory:\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed the storyline. It may have been a little slow-paced but I enjoyed the slow development. There are a few twists and some mystery involved in the story line, although some of it can be pretty predictable. I found it very interesting the way things turned out and there are some exciting events, however the first half of the series can get a bit irratating at times but I thought it was definetly worth it.\r\nArt:\r\nI LOVE the way the characters and scenery is drawn! Everything looked beautiful but not over exaggerated. Iam especially fond of the way the characters are drawn. Emotions are conveyed efficiently through the art which creates a more emotive feeling. The only slight down side is the way the gods are drawn. In the first episode the gods are basically uncreative blobs but further into the series more interesting gods/demons are introduced.\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music for the opening is stunning. I absolutely adore it! The sound used throughout the series consistently fitted with the scene and helped to create more vivid and emotive moments. Perfect.\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThere is a lot of development in many of the characters, particularly the guardians. They start off having very distinct characteristics which are individually likeable but also have some ideas and feelings that are quite negative. We see them all go from feeling one way to another, which sounds vague but I'm trying not to spoil it! I especially liked Mahiro-Senapi, he was funny throughout and is interaction with the others was always amusing. The guardians also have more serious sides and it's good to see well-rounded, realistic characters. Tamaki annoyed me a little because it took her a while to get into her role as the Tamayori princess but once she got her act together a bit more she was ok. I also really liked Mitsuru-chan, she was sweet and lovely and her character never failed to make me smile. \\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI loved this anime! I watched the first episode but I must admit I wasn't immediately hooked, I waited a whole week before deciding to try another episode and I'm glad I did. The first episode is pretty average but I promise the rest of the series was much more enjoyable! It was nice to see them all forming friendships and the romance between a certain two characters was highly engaging.. I would reccomend you watch this anime NOW! :)",

To all the characters in which every male harem I seen I  feel some male characters overshadow others, while this one just blend together with the female character. Which is other great fact is lead female character didn't get overshadow either, in fact it was focus on her and her journey. One key ingredient for me to love the show, is me wanting more. I trylooking up see it's manga series and sadly there not big series. \\n\r\nI think others will love this series, for the journey each character takes and how they work as kinda of mishap family, and the opening music will make you want to learn more about the story.",

I was thoroughly saddened by this anime. I had high expectations, but was disappointed. I got to episode 6, and dropped it. Let me explain:\r\nStory: 3. Okay. This is what got me the most. The plot is REAL slow. I mean, I've fallen asleep on the same episode at the same point three times in a row. It's just slow. I would not suggest this anime to someone who likes things fast paced. It'shard just to get past the first episode. I feel like there were plenty of scenes that did not need to be included in this anime.\\n\r\nArt: 8. The art was actually really beautiful. All the main characters: the good and bad were wonderfully drawn and animated. Of course, there were a few mishaps here and there, but that's expected. The monsters, however, are fairly dull. They aren't really anything special.\\n\r\nSound: 6. Mm... The music was really nice. The background music is mostly soft. That's probably what lulled me to sleep so many times... But it was good music.\\n\r\nCharacters: 6. It's really a reverse harem... The boys are nicely made. They have good characters and are well-developed. The only problem I had with them was that they followed the common-thread of the reverse harem, and even regular harem, world. It'd have been nice to spice them up a little more, but they are good characters. The main girl, Tamaki, is dreadfully boring. She's developed... she's just dull. There really isn't much to her. I'd say she's really the common girl in a common anime. There isn't anything special about her. She could have used a lot more work.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1. What can I say? After those scores I gave... it should be obvious why it's that low...\\n\r\nOverall: 3. It just really wasn't anything special.\\n\r\nUnless you are REALLY interested in slow-paces reverse harems, this isn't your anime. I suggest you just skip over it unless you really want to try. It really isn't anything special. I wouldn't suggest it.",

            "content": "Hiiro no Kakera Season 1 Review\r\n-5/10\r\nI love Reverse Harem. I really do. \r\nThat's why I've tried watching it. Romance, Reverse Harem and Historical. A perfect combination for me. So here, this is my review for this Anime.\r\nPlot: 6/10\r\nThe concept is okay, I guess. It is quite predictable and there's nothing much to be excited about, honestly. Well yeah, there are some questions in mind that will make you think to watch the next season. But it's 50 50 for me. Though I don't skip what anime I've already started so I will watch it some other time. T is quite difficult to give a reviewwithout spoiling anyone so I'll warn you. While this anime focuses on protecting something precious, they keep on losing and ranting on their situation, again and again. It makes me want to forward it to the next scene to the next episode and the like. Instead of dping things which can actually keep them from going forward, I don't think they've made an effort at all.\\n\r\nAs I've said, the concept or the plot was good enough, the point is the character didn't keep up on this or haven't made they role successfully.\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 4/10\\n\r\nCharacter Or Character Development is one of the thing I want to see when watching an anime. So basically, this anime fails to show me that. I love this genre, yeah. But what I want the most when I watch this kind of anime is for the girl or what we say protagonist to be brave, independent. Though it is a fact that a girl is much weaker. We can also show our strong side, our brave side. I don't see any changes at all and it seems that the slight changes on the final episodes is forceful. The romance in it is also forceful. I don't know how to say it but the relationship, the friendship and the like is quite forceful to me. It consists of 12 episodes but I don't think the anime successfully show the significance of each and every character in their own unique and awesome way.\\n\r\nSOUND: 9/10\\n\r\nI love the songs on this anime. I don't understand it but I feel the emotions on it. It made me save it on my music list, honestly. The voice of the character for me is fine. I don't really know how to rate it in sounds but really, the opening song of this anime is great.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 4/10\\n\r\nSorry but this anime is really boring for me. It really makes me want to fast forward it. But hey! I've successfully finish the season 1 without fastforwarding and skipping it. LOL. We have different types of anime so if you want an anime with hot guys protecting a weak girl, maybe this suits your taste. But sorry, I won't go on and say it's good so you need to watch it. Watch at your own risk.\\n\r\nSo yeah. That is my review for this anime. I don't remember what other categpries are there fpr reviewing an anime so I hope this helps! Thanks :)",

            "content": "Interesting beginning but with bits and pieces that keeps annoying me as i go on.\r\nSo why would i say this as a starter. Well as a beginning i dont think the story is bad per say although it wont say its original either. A zeal that shouldnt be unlocked and so on so on. For me the story begun good enough it was a nice beginning and i felt like it was felt good going into it. Then as the story went i felt it started to get rushed or it felt like they just had to push every action scene imaginable as they wenton. Honestly it felt uninteresting at some point since you never got to enjoy the anime or the scenery that was drawn it was more like when were done with this lets rush to this place and so on although its only 12 episodes so i will give them a break for that since most short anime like this almost needs to be rushed i feel. As the story went on i felt myself get more irritated then exited for whats next. Since it was almost like you could guess what happened in the next episode easily and i felt boring. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was typical shoujo anime style which i honestly like and the sound was very forgetable to be honest beside some small beautiful pieces. \\n\\n\r\nKasuga, Tamaki is what i would call main main meaning she is above the rest as she is the center of attention per say. When i talk about this character my bias personality will come forth because this kind of main character is one of the worst types imo. Why because she is supposed to feel a great almost divine princess but end up being more useless than Sakura in the entire original Naruto series. She became a meat shield spouting idealistic thoughts without even thinking or reading up on what she talked about and frankly it was annoying  to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of her Harem if you want are typical in that they have their own types of personalities. Some of them are interesting kinda but some of them are so annoying or irritating that its hard to feel sympathy for their causes or thoughts. \\n\\n\r\nWell i enjoyed it as a normal fantasy anime with a spice of reverse harem but to be frank its not an anime that leaves me with a big impression. it was normal and ok i mean it wasnt bad but it wasnt anything over either. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime goes from  5 to 6 as i think but i still feel its a little better than just a 5 so i felt 6 is the only thing i should give it. If you like eye candy for girls = good looking guys  and you want to feel like the main girl in the story then this anime might be for you (btw then i advice watching after the ending ) and if you generally like shoujo like anime. But if you want a fantasy anime or even reverse harem with a little more interesting parts in it i wouldnt really say that this is a go to watch anime.",

However, I have now watched up to episode 11 and have found the story completely unsatisfactory. Starting from around episode six or seven the same thing has happened over and over again. The main character says the same overly dramatic phrase about five times in each episode and all the other characters ooh and ahh over her caring personality. If your interested in desperately waiting from episode to episode for something somewhat interesting to occur andthen be disappointed then this is the anime for you. At this point in the anime there is nothing else to look forward to.",

I was a little uncertain at first but after the first few episodes it really got good.\r\nI'm supposed to tell you why I liked it so I'll do my best.\r\nI really like reverse harems.  I said that on my profile, so this is about as reverse harem you can get.  The main character is really great.  Her personality is real and a lot like me.  I would do mostly what she did.  (I really hate animes that I want to punch the main character in the face for being stupid.)\r\nTheromance in this anime is wonderful.  I really mean it, although most of it is in the second season, it is still developing from the beginning.  And I gave it a nine in enjoyment only because I selfishly wanted there to be just a little more romance in the first season, because I love it so much, and I thought it was just a tiny bit slow to start.  (But I completely understand why they did it.)\\n\r\nThe story is very well developed and I loved the twists and turns it takes.\\n\r\nThe art was pretty good, some of it you could tell was computer generated, but it couldn't get too much better.\\n\r\nThe characters were fun, frustrating, and pretty real. (Which to me is good.)\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review was useful.  I tried my best, and if you like reverse harems, romance, (good looking guys), super-natural powers, or all of the above you should definitely watch it.  I loved it and I hope you do too.",

Some of the characters can be annoying despite their cute looks. But overall it is a really good anime in my book and I look forward to every new episode.",

Seriously? We all know that the first guy that saves the girl is the one true guy for her in the end. The guys are pretty good looking and the only humor that I saw in it was the blue haired boy hitting another guy because he doesnt punch girls. And the girl's persoanlity all acting confused and soft and sweet made me want to barf. If you dont likeheriones that annoys you like this one, dont bother watching it. She is as hesitant to accept whatever life throws her way as a kid in a candy store with millions of choices to choose from. If you do like this kind of anime, enjoy. ( not really)",

They also have enemies of course which is mostly the point of it. It's just a simple anime with some ups and downs. I wouldn't say it was very good but it was near ok and good.

They had chances to kiss at least you know and I know the story would have to be altered if that happened, but the story would be a lot more enjoyable. ( I'm big on reverse harem with romance lol )",

            "content": "To begin, I'd like to say that this review will only be considering the first season of this anime (the first thirteen episodes). I just got done watching Hiiro no Kakera a few moments ago, and I thought I should go ahead and review what I've seen so far before moving on to the next season. I will not include any spoiler content. With all of that being said...\r\nBefore I move onto actually critiquing different aspects of the series, there are a few points I would like to bring up. For one, Hiiro no Kakera, as far as I've watched, seems to be an animethat caters almost exclusively to its main genre--romance. In other words, be sure not to watch this show expecting it to have much action, drama, or any other element; the romance aspect of the story is focused on almost entirely, leaving every other aspect to amount to little more than background noise. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. If you came here looking for a decent romance anime, this one gets right down to it. Another point to take note of is that, yes, the series progresses very slowly throughout the first season. Even the actual \"climax\" of the story up to this point is pretty tame. Personally, I did not mind the slow progression of the story, as I began watching Hiiro no Kakera with the sole purpose of wanting to kill some time with a cheesy romance, and it offers that and then some. So, if you're still interested in watching up to this point, I'll move onto the ratings I gave to the anime. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nIt is nothing special as far as romance anime goes. The plot is pretty straight to the point throughout the first season. A high school girl learns that she is actually a princess due to her lineage and ends up being guarded by five individualistic and extremely good looking men. There aren't many twists and turns, but plenty of hot guys and cutesy moments to enjoy. As I've stated previously, the simplicity of the show (up to this point) does not necessarily mean it is bad. I would be lying if I said I didn't get a decent bit of entertainment out of it. All in all, the plot is sturdy but not a diamond in the rough as of yet. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is one of the highest points of the series. The 3d animation used has been hit or miss so far, but otherwise, it is beautiful--very crisp and fluid. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nNow, honestly, the thing about the audio that earns sound a 7 is not the voice acting. In truth, the voice actors seemed to get kind of lazy as the story progressed. Fairly often, some of them would even slip out of their usual speaking voices (notably Ohmi). The voice acting is decent, all in all, and in itself, it could probably earn sound a 6 or so; however, what earned sound a 7 from me is the music. From the amazing opening melody to the traditional riffs that play here and there throughout the show, the music was great, in my opinion. It set a tone for the show all on its own, and might almost make up for the voice actors' semi-frequent slip-ups. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nThere's nothing wrong with the characters at all. I only gave them a 6 because they have portrayed themselves to be pretty one-dimensional and not anything out of the ordinary, especially as far as characters from a romance or a reverse harem anime goes. The main group of young men includes the aggressive but protective type, the mature and intelligent type, the meek but considerate type, the cool and collected type, and the hot-headed but secretly sensitive type. The villains are what I'd consider to be the lowest point of the characters; they're just boring and stereotypical. I did enjoy watching most of the characters on screen, although they weren't groundbreaking. There is a hot guy of every flavor, though, so I'd say the options are nice. There's someone for almost anyone, haha!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nAgain, if you begin watching this anime expecting it to be what it actually is--almost STRICTLY a simple romance/reverse harem--then you will probably be able to enjoy it. I know I was! I like it enough to be moving onto the next season once I finish this review, at least!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5\\n\r\nI couldn't really settle on a 6 or 7 for this because I truly believe that the anime has potential despite how simply the plot is set up to the point I've watched. It has cool basic concepts and was enjoyable, if nothing else, despite the downfalls of it. It is a great choice for anyone looking to check out a relatively lighthearted (in the sense that none of the drama or plot devices get super intense in this season), straight-to-it romance/reverse harem. I feel inclined to bring up the fact that I've seen a lot of reviews bashing the female protagonist, Tamaki, for being useless and taking too long to awaken her true potential. In my opinion, the slow buildup to her gaining her powers has been pretty entertaining, albeit she's realized them fairly marginally so far. Every now and then, I can appreciate a show that takes things slow in order to focus on developing characters and character relationships. Do not expect much action-wise from Tamaki, but I wouldn't consider her character anything extreme like completely annoying or useless. She has a lot of room to grow, and I'm excited to see where her story goes. Hiiro no Kakera is an anime that is good at what it is supposed to be doing, but not much else. Despite that, it is a fun watch with a lot of potential to develop into something much better than it already is!\\n\\n\r\nI hope to write a review for the second season soon, so if you are still wondering if you should waste time on this anime, there may be more persuasive answers (whether that be for better or for worse) there! Hope this helped!",

            "content": "In short, this is a quite enjoyable anime. The story is well written,even though it might appear boring for some if not most people. However,those of you who likes to watch show based on mythologies,this is a perfect anime for you.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is well-paced.I have not seen any sort of rush in both of the season.It developed it's way through from the very first episode till the end and resolves all the conflict it presents.The first season starts off with introducing Tamayori hime and the five seal guardians,and quickly brings in the enemies into the plot without wasting any time.Instead of slowly talking about theTamayori and Onikirimaru legend,it instead tells the story part by part.I'm pretty sure this is what throws a lot of viewers out who wants to see a quick plot that goes straight into action.However,I believe the approach they took to tell the story was a good one,even though it flushes out most of the viewers.The story focuses on mythology,even though I am not sure if it's a made-up mythology of Onikirimaru or if it's a real mythical character.But since I like animes that focuses on this sort of topic, I enjoyed it a lot.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound:\\n\r\nThe art was pretty modern.The colors gave it more of a mythical vibe,as if it has taken place a long time ago.The battle scenes were pretty badass and the flashy skills the characters did were exciting. The sounds also boost the tension during the battle scenes.(P.S : I love the 2 opening songs though <3 )\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe story begins with introducing a mentally lost girl who moved in to the village from Tokyo and suddenly learned that she was some sort of a hime who is suppose to strengthen some sort of seal to protect the world ...I'm pretty sure if you are walking in the street and suddenly someone takes you away to White House and says you are president now,you will feel quite lost.Along with her,the story introduces 5 guys who are the guardian of the seals she is suppose to protect and the enemy team who is trying to break the seal.Throughout the 2 seasons,her friendship and relationship between the 5 guardian are increased.However,some of the characters are left in the dark except for Takuma.I feel like they should have gave more characteristic to the other 4 character and why or how their family started to protect Tamayori hime and such.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, like I said before, I liked this anime a lot.Even though I know it's from an Otome game,so it was natural to see some reversed-harem going on,which is 1 of my favorite genres.However,I was happy when she actually acted on her own and picked someone,unlike other reversed-harem animes.But,the storyline on this anime were more interesting to me rather than who she picks.Plus,it was obvious in the 2nd season too,since everyone is a good friend to her,but there was only one who was most important to her. I wish they would make more animes like this.",

There's nothing that really stood out to me.\r\nEnjoyment/overall: 6/10 Although at times, I didn't think the story wasgoing to go anywhere, by the last episode I did want to see what would happen next. I enjoyed that by the end at least some of the characters were explained and built more depth then they previously had in the beginning. There is a second season, so maybe giving it a chance will show a more interesting story...",

            "content": "All right, I'll break down my review the way MyAnimeList does it. \r\nStory-5\r\nThe story starts out with out heroine going to Kifu to stay with her grandmother, since her parents are going over seas to, if I remember correctly, Africa. There she is confronted by things known as 'drowned gods' and is consequently told by her grandmother that not only is she the next Tamayorihime, but that she and her guardians also have to protect the artifacts that keep this thousand year old demon, Onikirimaru, sealed. The only catch is that she has yet to awaken as the Tamayorihime. And thus, her life filled withreally bizarre hot guys, weird supernatural events, persistent and crazed bad guys, and deceitful people behind every turn, begins!\\n\\n\r\nOkay.I honestly really wanted to like this anime. I think the story in and of itself, wasn't a bad idea, especially for what was originally an otome game. It had so much potential, and there were so many things that they could have done with the story, but they didn't, and it's just sad. They didn't build up the story at all, and any fight scenes there were, I felt emotionally detached from. There was no real moment in the anime where I was really into anything the characters were doing. Instead, I would find my mind wandering or me fighting the urge to bang my head on the keyboard. During the \"emotional\" moments, I would find myself getting ticked off because everything was just so cliche it was unreal. \\n\\n\r\nArt-7\\n\\n\r\nOne of the redeeming features of the anime was its art, though not necessarily the animation. The characters were pretty. It's what you'd expect from otome game characters. I think one of the only reasons I was able to stick through both season of this anime is because I liked the art enough to keep going. The animation on the other hand was funky at times. Especially when the drowned gods appear. I think they were trying to do some kind of cg effect, but it didn't work out very well. Instead, it just looked like the drowned gods had been photoshopped into the scene. \\n\\n\r\nSound- 6\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason the sound is so high it because the first season opening song is beautiful. Maika Fujito does a truly spectacular job on that song. The second season ending song isn't that bad either though. I can't really say much about the background music throughout each episode, because it didn't really capture my attention. I guess it wasn't bad, but it also wasn't something noteworthy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3\\n\\n\r\nOh goodness. I don't even know how to put what I feel for the characters into words. There were two characters that I actually really liked throughout the entire anime. One of those being Komura, and the other being the cute little fox deity thing that was always around Tamaki, O-chan. All the other characters severely annoyed me. Tamaki was pretty much completely useless the entire time, and the others had so many conflicts between not only themselves, but also with Tamaki, that it really made me wonder at times how they even managed to protect anything at all. \\n\\n\r\nThere wasn't really any character development, though there were plenty of times where it could have easily occurred.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 3\\n\\n\r\nI seriously forced myself to watch both seasons. It was painful to do, but I did it. I think it was probably a waste of two days though. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 4.8, which rounds up to 5. Though I seriously want to round it down. I really don't recommend it. There are much better otome adaptations out there. Go watch those, and save yourself the pain.",

            "content": "When I watched the first episode of Hiiro no Kakera, I was super excited to continue watching it. It got my attention the first few minutes and I loved the characters and how they were presented. But about half way in the series,  it started to disappoint me a little.\r\nStory: 8 \r\nI very much enjoy the concept of a MC discovering that they're actually a powerful guardian. It gives them time to adjust and adapt to what they need to become. Although it is a reverse harem/Shoujo/romance anime, the action scenes and supernatural elements were really cool in my opinion. I have to admit,guys may not want to watch it because of the little random things each of the main male characters will say in order at the end to 'appeal to the audience' and some guys may find it weird. XD \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI liked the art style because it was a lot different than other animes I've watched in the past. And I enjoyed how the characters looked. It gave you a mix between a lighthearted feeling and a dismal one. At least for me. I could only say the action was a little awkward for me, it just felt a little to rushed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nBesides the OP, I couldn't find any soundtracks that stuck with me. I wouldn't even notice them playing in the background most of the time. But the OP gives you the same feeling the characters are feeling in the anime: hope.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nIn my opinion, I think the characters suffered quite a bit in the anime. I mean, the guys all had their own types of interesting personalities, and I like them all. There's two that I really adored to tell you the truth. The bad guys were a little flat in character for me. And sadly, Tamaki could've been a lot better. She was likable and always cared about her friends, but she could get a little annoying. All the guardians were nearly dying to protect her, and all she could do was yell there names when they got horribly beat up. Towards the end though, her character really shines. So that's a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nThis anime had an interesting plot and I enjoyed the story, plus the main heroine finally showed everyone what she could do and it made me super happy. I'll definitely be watching the second season to see if the show picks up and improves a lit more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nIt's pretty good if you stick with it to the very end, and it's not a bad anime at all. I just think it could've been better. You should check it out if you're into reverse harems. Which I very much am.\\n\r\n~Thank you all for listening!~\\n",

I saw the first episode and it seemed interesting but as I watched it more it got kind of boring..\r\nthe art is wonderful and is the animation but the story line got a little boring. The basic story line is intersting but some how it got a little draggy. \r\n The main lead isn't annoying as some leads can get. She is a little frustrating in what she thinks but over all its a okay anime.\r\ni wouldn't recommend it if your really looking for something new to watch. Its something to watch in between.",

            "content": "This is my second review so I hope this goes well. I gave this anime a 6 overall rating, which for me is actually pretty good. it was a n enjoyable watch, with a few problems that I think brought down the overall rating for me. \r\nStory: The story is where the anime lost a lot of points for me. first of all you have your main character, Tamaki, who is you average useless girl who is thrust into a situation where she gets to have multiple hot guys basically protect her from everything while each falling love with her. In that respect it`s youtypical reverse harem, but what really got to me was the main idea of the story, which this site explains pretty well, of a girl getting special powers and is guarded by five men who are half demon. But for me this story line wasn`t used to its fullest extent which is why the rating is so low.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: I though that the animation for the characters themselves were pretty consistent for a harem type anime. Lots of hot guys and beautiful girls with     there rarely being an ugly person in the whole mix. That said the background and demons in my opinion could have used some work. There was a lot of repetition with demon types and styles, not to mention the battle scenes seemed to be rip offs of each other with rarely anything new happening until the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Like previously mentioned our main character Tamaki is an ordinary girl who is suddenly given a huge change in her life. She had, in my opinion little to no character development all. This is also the same of many of the other characters. Since this is only the first season it is to be expected, as the show is more laying out the foundation for the second season.\\n\\n\r\nSound: This was probably the best part of the whole anime for me, both the opening and ending track was amazing and well suited to this anime. As well as the background music during some scenes was amazing as it help set the tone of the episodes really well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Despite all my criticism I do actually think that this first season was a pretty good start to the series. While I like the second season better, I liked how this season set this up so that it was easy to follow along and really get to know the characters, despite their lack of development.  I think that anybody interested in a pretty good romance anime then they should try this.",

At the beginning I was a little confused about the Tamayori princess stuff, but later on I began to understand the concept of everything.\r\nI have to say I immediately fell in love with the characters. Their look was outstanding, they had great personalities, the way their past was introduced was amazing. Every character had his/her own story that was told in different ways throughout the episodes, and that's what I really liked.\r\nI really likedthe voice actors and I think they did a very good job,\\n\\n\r\nThe story was really good. I haven't watched many anime, but in my opinion, it was unique. The plot in both seasons was interesting and exiting. \\n\r\n- In season 1, in my opinion, the action took a tiny bit too long to happen, but when it did, i started enjoying the episodes more and more as they got exiting.\\n\r\n- In season 2 the action started immediately, got very exiting and quite interesting and of course HAPPY END! hehe\\n\\n\r\nI don't know what else to saaaaaaay....\\n\r\nI'll end it here. I really enjoyed watching this anime, it was really exiting, interesting and funny. \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend watching this!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",
