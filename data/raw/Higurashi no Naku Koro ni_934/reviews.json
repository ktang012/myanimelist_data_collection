            "content": "Watching Higurshi is like locking a group of happy people in a test chamber, only coming back to find they've hacked each other into a bloody mess. Its horrific, its shocking, and yet a part of you, cannot help but wonder, how did it happen?\nThe curiosity takes over... and so you repeat the experiment, knowing full well that those cute looking teenagers you just sent are going to end up as bloody pulps. But hey, at least each time they die, you're one step closer to figuring out why they died, it's all good.\nHigurashi essentially places you in the role of the scientist. It dividesitself into several arcs, each of which begin exactly the same. A teenager moves into a remote countryside village, and befriends a group of sweet fangirls that could have come out right from a harem rom/com. Then, explicably, thing go wrong... very wrong. \\n\\n\nThe pacing is excellent, the suspence pulpable. You know terrible things are going to happen, but you don't know exactly what. Higurashi would appeal to two types of people. The maglomanics who cackle madly in seeing a happy community descend into the depth of oblivion, and the curious scientist who watched each arc with intense interest... for they want to know exact *why* everything goes wrong (though they can also cackle madly just a little).\\n\\n\nThe true draw of Higurashi is the mystery. The series will leave you guessing, postulating all manner of reasons why the sweetest girl in the class is now butchering every child in sight with a giant cleaver. Each experiment you run (arc you see) reveals a few more clues, and you formulate a new theory, only to find it shattered by another totally unexpected horror in the very same arc. The beauty of Higurashi is that a mystery of such grand scale, every detail is meticulous, and while every bloody event seems random at first, they all eventually fall into place\\n\\n\nNot only are the characters are memorable, and filled with interesting secrets, and unlike school days, they're actually also extreme likeable. This is no small achievement, given what they're portrayed doing to each other. \\n\\n\nHigurashi is really the pinnacle of a dark mystery. You'll start off the mad scientist, watching those innocents in the test chamber with morbid curiosity. Yet, slowly, that morbid curiosity will be transformed into sympathy, and as you fall in love these victims, that initial curiosity will into turn a genuine desire to figure out whats going on so that they can be saved.\\n\\n\n***\\n\\n\nAs always, I welcome feedback!\\n",

            "content": "Higurashi epitomizes how you should never judge something by its cover. At first glance, it looks like a simple, generic harem series or a lame, cliched romance. This anime, however, is nothing short of genius. The whole setting, atmosphere, and mood are incredibly well executed. The plot may seem simple at first, a new kid moving to a strange, new town and meeting new friends. Beneath the exterior appearance of this seemingly tame series, however, lies a dark story of murder, violence, and mystery.\r\nStory: I can confidently say that the story/plot is the strongest aspect of this series. I congratulate the original game designer whocreated this series. The execution of the plot is genius. This series mainly consists of arcs. Although these arcs seem disjointed at first, it is all part of the plot and is actually an important part of solving the mystery of the Hinamizawa murders. However, this is not a simple, generic murder mystery where the solutions are force fed to the viewers; it is up to them to decide between what is true and what is not. This way, it makes the viewers think and interact with the story, and this is what I love most about Higurashi.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: If there is one reason why I did not give this series a 10, then it is because of the art and animation. The art itself is not too bad, but the animation... How do I start? It can be extremely inconsistent at time with all those emo face contortions, sometimes out of sync, and was probably animated with a relatively low budget. Thank goodness the director of season 2 learned from those mistakes, and the animation greatly improved in Kai. One good thing I have to say is that the background and setting is very well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice acting in this series is amazing. With a series filled with psychotic laughter, blood-curling screams, and in some cases, extremely cute voices, the voice actors/actresses are extremely versatile. The Opening is one of my favorite openings of all time. It sets up the mood extremely well and sent shivers down my spine when I first saw it. There could not have been a better fitting opening. The ending, a slow rather mellow piece, suffers from horrible Engrish. I do love the piano part in the end though. Finally, the background music set the mood nicely, but can get repetitive at times. I did like the sounds of the cicadas; it gave a feeling of impending  doom.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: After the initial shock of their mental instability, the cast of characters are extremely well written and developed. Sure, none of the main cast of characters is emotionally and mentally stable; it does not take away from their personality and interaction. One of the best things about this series is that there is no throw away characters that only appear once, does something, and leaves. Every character serves a purpose in the mystery and plot, either directly and indirectly. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: As I have said earlier, I love how Higurashi is not a passive anime where I can just sit in front of the computer and shut off my brain. Then again, I love psychological anime. Higurashi was the first series that forced me to watch raws because I could not wait for the subs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall an excellent show. This would definitely be a 10 if not for its mediocre animation. Final rating: 9/10\\n",

            "content": "\u2013Spoilers\u2013\r\nHigurashi no naku koro ni happens to be a particular favourite of mine, not only because of its horrifically high gore content, but for the number of times it managed to catch me off guard. I found it hard to believe how someone could commit such stomach-churning acts of violence and mental torture. It\u2019s the original shock at this fact that compels the viewer to continue watching this highly addictive bloodbath of an anime.\r\nThe concept of the anime is simple enough. It follows a teenage boy, Maebara Keiichi adjusting to his new life in Hinamizawa, an isolated village buried deep in the mountains. It\u2019s notlong before he makes friends with a group of girls. At first glance they seem like the average group of teenage girls but all is not as it seems because they\u2019re actually hiding things from Keiichi, things like the mysterious string of murders that seem to occur the same night every year and the gruesome dismemberment of a dam construction worker. The more Keiichi learns about these past events and about his new \u2018friends\u2019 the more danger he begins to find himself in. \\n\\n\r\nIt is important to remember that Higurashi is divided into 6 separate arcs that feature completely different scenarios. This means that if a character were to meet their unfortunate demise in one arc they would return once again at the start of the next arc. It is this separation of the arcs that often confuses or deters people from watching the show. I too confused by the sudden, miraculous \u2018revival\u2019 of a few of the characters at first but the sooner you adjust to the ever-changing alternate storylines the sooner you can start to piece together the puzzle and work out why the murders are being carried out in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of this anime is nothing spectacular; in fact it seems pretty inappropriate for this particular genre of anime. The girls could very well have been plucked straight from a harem anime, but for some wacky reason that seems to work for this anime. The outward \u2018Lolita\u2019 appearances of the girls only make their actions more shocking in contrast; in a sense their design lulls you into a false sense of security. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike in other anime of this particular genre it is difficult not to find someone to like in Higurashi, which is highly unusual considering the sickening acts of torture these girls perform on each other and with those around them. As you begin to get to know the characters better, you begin to sympathise with them and hope that they too won\u2019t meet an untimely fate, thus you begin to feel more involved. Each character has their own interesting perspective and heart-breaking story to tell, it is this that alleviates the anime from being a bloodbath to a bloodbath with depth. \\n\\n\r\nBoth the Higurashi OP and EN themes are hauntingly beautiful and nigh on impossible to fault. Shimamiya Eiko does an amazing job at capturing the show\u2019s otherworldly aspect with her almost ethereal voice during the OP theme. The instrumental themes used throughout the show can both send chills down your spine or even cause you to laugh out loud given the right moment. I found that the show\u2019s use of chilling piano solos or mellow flute pieces helped to build tension and inspire fear within myself as a viewer, so by keeping the themes themselves simple they\u2019ve helped to accentuate the atmosphere of the show rather than outshine it completely.\\n\\n\r\nAs the viewer becomes more intertwined in both the storyline and with the characters their desire for the characters to be set free from the horrific chain of events grows stronger, it is this that hooks the viewer into watching episode after episode. So overall, for being able to manipulate its viewers emotions so well I\u2019d give this anime a near perfect score of 9/10.\\n",

            "content": "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni has received much praise from the anime community in general, which hails it as the mystery to end all mysteries. Everybody loves it and chances are that, if you're reading this now, you've heard good news!\r\nHowever, upon my completion of the anime and the 2 subsequent seasons that followed, I came to the conclusion that this praise was COMPLETELY undeserved by the anime, which is mediocre in the intellectual department, and is much less a mystery story than it is an action/adventure story with a lot of secrets. Furthermore, any actual \"mystery\" behind the story is made impossible to solveby the introduction of unnecessary paranormal elements and fictional diseases.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I was very disappointed by this anime, and it is not worth the hype.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nStory: The first part of the first season I found to be very interesting indeed. Everything was confined within the laws of physics, and I was constantly on my toes trying to solve the mystery of Hinamizawa. Sadly, the story floundered from the last arc of the first season up to halfway through the second season, and it became a chore to watch. The introduction of unnecessary paranormal elements and fictional diseases did not help either, and only served to further complicate the plot while not adding much value to the story. In any case, we certainly could have done without them. Luckily, the story picks back up during the second half of the second season, which greatly makes up for the absolute failure of a first half, and you'll probably find yourself pleased with the ending.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would say that the story lowered itself from what it could be (an awesome mystery story) to what it is now... a confusing action adventure story for people that like to pretend they know what's going on from the very first episode.\\n\\n\r\nScore - 6; Completely overrated. So much wasted potential...\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: I wouldn't say that the art is completely terrible, but it certainly could've been better. The artist uses gradeschool techniques of using unusual hair to differentiate the characters. Okay. The little girls are anorexic and have square-shaped heads. Alright. Mion and Shion have stereotypical oversized breasts. I'm losing my patience...\\n\\n\r\nThen I figured out that Teppei Houjou is a recolor of Ooishi.\\n\\n\r\nNow I'm just angry.\\n\\n\r\nThe blood and gore portrayed in the anime does help alleviate the pains of this travesty though, and the general art style isn't atrocious like in some other anime I know, so I can't give it a 0.\\n\\n\r\nScore - 3; Everything you would expect to see in an anime, with added blood. I don't see why everyone thinks it's so special.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: I found that the voice actors fit the characters well, and I was also impressed by the ending and opening themes for each series. However, I found some of the character dialogue cheesy, and some of the children's speech patterns were annoying (okay Satoko, you miss your brother, we get it.)\\n\\n\r\nScore - 7; The VA's were good, the soundtrack is nothing to scoff at, but the dialogue is not without its flaws.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: You know, I must admit that the character development was pretty &quot;good&quot;. In fact, it was so &quot;good&quot;, that I was bored by it. I found Rika's long tangents later in the series to be uninformative, uninteresting, and unimportant. But it's okay because &quot;it helps build her character!&quot; right? \\n\\n\r\nWrong! \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, I don't see why the hell the older characters would even bother to hang around with the younger ones, aside from Shion that is. And, more importantly, why the devil does someone like Satoko know guerrilla warfare!? Humorous as it may be, I don't believe it is ever explained.\\n\\n\r\n(and even if it is, that doesn't explain why she can knock Keiichi flat across the room without batting an eyelash!)\\n\\n\r\nScore - 4; I was sarcastic when I said that the character development was good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Despite being highly disappointed by the anime as a whole, the ending was cute and the beginning does get you hooked pretty quickly, so I did moderately enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nI think my favorite arc was when Keiichi threw the ohagi at the wall. I lol'd pretty hard.\\n\\n\r\nScore - 7; Maybe I'm being generous, but I had a few good laughs and there was nothing better than seeing the look on Keiichi's face when that ohagi went splat.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6; Although I was highly disappointed by it, the anime did have its good points. My advice to you is don't listen to the hype and don't bother with it unless you like shoddy, confusing storylines.",

Mind-bending, chaotic and filled with near-perfect execution.\r\nStory: The story focuses on the village of Hinamizawa, and it's hidden and very chilling secrets.  Keiichii Maebara has just moved to the countryside village, and is enjoying his new life with his new friends Rena Ryuugu, Mion Sonozaki, Rika Furude and Satoko Houjou. But underneath the peaceful times, is the chilling mysteries of the Hinamizawa Dam Construction murders, and the Watangashi festival. With this season split intothe 4 question arcs and the first two answer arcs, not everything is answered yet. But the crazy plot twists will keep you eager to watch the next episode, even if you see a gruesome scene or two.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: All the characters (Especially Rena and Rika) look very cute, and the backgrounds are all quite well animated. The art style is wonderful too. But unfortunately, their faces distort to X-stream when they're in psycho mode. These inconsistencies with the animation is sometimes an added plus when it comes to scaring you even more.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I'm addicted to the OP and ED. I adore the little touch at the end when they do the next episode preview while the piano plays at the end of the ED. The background music also fits in very well, and the voice acting is superb. How can they laugh so well? Must be practice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I enjoyed every character in at least one arc. I even liked Satoko and Shion in arcs 2 and 3. Though nothing can beat Rika's cute phrases and Rena's graceful style. They all develop through the story at a steady pace. Keichii's behavior changes quite a bit throughout the show too, but I believe that he will be a very strong character in Kai. His determination and his will to trust his friends will pull him through. Oishi and Irie was also great minor characters, but I'm unsure on which side they are really on, and their motives...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Simply put, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is the perfect anime for anyone that enjoys to really interact, predict and think with the storyline and it's characters. An unbelievable horror anime, and a decent comedy too. Hey, i liked the lame comedy scenes. This is Studio DEEN's masterpiece.",

            "content": "There is an alarming number of people in the online anime community who hail this series as one of the best series in not only the horror/suspense/mystery genre, but in all of anime itself. For the life of me, I cannot discern where people get these feelings from. Higurashi is one of the most over rated series I've ever watched.\r\n90% of the reason Higurashi is so terrible results directly due to the fact that the series is basically the same premise retold over and over again, a little different each time, in each 4-6 episode arc. It becomes a chore to watch it after yourealize it's going to start over and retell a similar story in the second arc. But it goes beyond that, once you realize it's not even the same story. It's an entirely new story that has little to do with what you just watched before it.\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi attempts to be a mystery, yet fails miserably. A mystery requires consistancy, something Higurashi lacks entirely. What happens in each arc is not the same as what happened in the arc before it. Imagine a story that retells itself again and again, each time showing you different perspectives of the same story, letting you in on different key knowledge that you may have lacked in the last arc, that you might come to understand and solve the mystery over time: This is what Higurashi SHOULD have been. But it's not. Each arc tells the story differently, to the degree that you are confused by what has actually happened and what events are relevant to what is currently going on. Things happen so differently that what is actually going on is indecipherable, leaving Higurashi little more than imagery of cute little girls turning psychotic in various situations that tell no complete story. Higurashi is utterly confusing and incomprehensible. The true mystery becomes, \"Why does this have nothing to do with what I watched in the last arc?\" not, \"Why are strange murders happening every year at the same time.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing propelling you to watch more of Higurashi is faith that it will eventually explain everythng to you. But it will not. Without giving any spoilers, Higurashi throws entirely new concepts at you at the end which bring about more questions than answers. At the end of the 26 episodes, one feels entirely cheated, as though an enormous amount of time has been wasted. One goes on web forums and complains of this, only to be told by fervent lolicons that, \"You have to watch the second series before judging it. It explains all.\" But one is left looking at another 20-something episode long series and feeling not very optimistic, ready to watch something worthwhile, something that is not Higurashi. I don't waste my time watching an entire season with very little redeemable about it to conclude that I need to watch the second season. I just cut my losses and move on.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't even likeable. There is a stupid male protagonist that is often referred to as bright even though he consistently does the stupidest things known to man (horror protagonist syndrome) and everyone else is a generic little girl. Oh, and there's a detective. In one arc he's a nice guy. In another he's a terrible douchebag. Again, no consistency.\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi will appeal to certain groups of people: Lolicons, people that like stuff just because it is weird and confusing, and people that like anything with blood and graphicness in it. Unless you fit that bill, I cannot comprehend what you would like about Higurashi. The only good thing I can say about it is that there are parts of it that are a bit creepy. But it's even a bad suspense story, as each time the suspense builds up, the story retells itself in a new arc and drops all the suspense.\\n\\n\r\nIgnore the hype. Unless you like little girls, pass on this one.",

            "content": "Higurashi is a really confusing, complex and difficult to explain anime. Some may view it as belonging to the horror or psychological genre; some may find it as a really weird harem series containing crazy, killer lolis; others may consider it a failure since it doesn't seem to belong to any of the afore-mentioned genres. Considering how much amount Higurashi incorporates, all views are understandable; this certainly isn't a series that's easy to comprehend by everyone. Higurashi is a mixture of mystery, blood, humor, romance and especially nice moral stories; but above all \u2013 Higurashi should be perceived as a really challenging logic problem.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, there are two approaches when watching Higurashi. You may choose to view it as any other anime: wait for the story to unfold, wait for the characters to develop, wait for the plot to advance. It isn't a wrong choice; this way, you may either like or dislike Higurashi; yet you will probably never get beyond the 'killer lolis', 'aww Rena is so adorable', 'okay, something is seriously wrong with this anime' stage. Yes, you might like, maybe even love it; but you will certainly NOT enjoy Higurashi to its full potential, for everything it has to offer. \\n\\n\r\nIf you choose the other road, however, you're in for a big torment. You will be annoyed, hurt, growling, and most of all, you will get headaches from the fake hints; to put it easier, you will be mindfucked. Higurashi manages to do something that very few series have succeeded in doing: involve the viewer by making him interact with everything that unfolds on the screen. \\n\\n\r\nHigurashi's main characteristic is that it's intelligently and elegantly indirect. You are shown almost opposite images of the same place, person or event and left to judge by yourself whether that's relevant or not, whether there's something hidden behind the apparent motives  and whether it's the correct portrayal of what's actually happening. What may be the correct deduction of a sequence of events at some point is completely overthrown later on; the theories you may have built in the very beginning, some more far-fetched than the others, all crumble as the story progresses. Because Higurashi is so brilliantly created, it actually presents a lot of fake hints, irrelevant tips and confusing matters; but that's all the more reason to enjoy it in the very end and re-watch it as many times as possible. \\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply, it's not wrong to view Higurashi as a math problem. You may wait for it to be solved by a teacher or someone in your class and understand it along the way. Or you may try to solve it yourself, by bumping upon walls and dead ends, reaching incorrect results and choosing the wrong parameters \u2013 but having a feeling of a much deeper satisfaction once you finish it. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi's story is its strongest point. The viewer is presented a series of 6 of the 8 main sound novel arcs, all beginning at approximately the same point, having certain common characteristics, but unfolding differently. If you are not a fan of 'what if?' scenarios, then this certainly isn't for you. However, if you do enjoy putting the pieces together and forming a puzzle (which lacks the very core\u2014the margins, only to be completed on season 2), then you will find this extremely  entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nChecking Higurashi's synopsis, you will see that there are question arcs and answer arcs. Do not be naive. Answer arcs might solve apparent issues, but they only bring up even more questions \u2013 related to the overall story. Don't watch Higurashi expecting to see that if 'a+b=c, then b=c-a'. Higurashi will simply say: 'a + something = c, I'll only give you bits and scraps hinting to what that certain something is, so use your brain to figure out the truth, 'cause I'm not gonna tell ya directly.' \\n\\n\r\nIf you are to take each of Higurashi's arcs separately, they all follow the same pattern. Each scenario begins with a peaceful, tranquil Hinamizawa in the summer light, only to end up in a diametrically opposed atmosphere. This might sound quite repetitive in the beginning, but do not forget that it's only a means of hiding the true face of this show. Also, don't make the mistake of thinking each arc can be seen individually; Higurashi does have an overall plot that links together the sectioned, secondary stories. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi's characters are all really refreshing, strong-determined and easy to recognize. Although their evolution throughout each arc might seem a bit inconsistent, they do develop from scenario to scenario, which only adds up to the enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nKeiichi:\\n\r\nKeiichi is a strong main male character. And he should be, considering what he has to face. It's not just unusual club activities or dealing with a lot of girls; Keiichi has to have the willpower to take what he sees as the (often regretful) right decision at the right time. Keiichi isn't a person to back up when it comes to challenges or teasing; if it's within his reach, he'll do anything to have the best possible outcome. \\n\\n\r\nRena:\\n\r\nRena is a character that might seem extremely likable in the very beginning, but her patterns of acting do tend to get a bit overused as the series progresses. Rena is a typical, nice, charming girl; however, remember that this is Higurashi, so nothing actually is as the first impression suggests. Rena has her dark sides too; quite a lot, in fact. She's one of the elements that give the series its most eerie moments. \\n\\n\r\nMion:\\n\r\nMion is the sanest of all the characters. She's pretty much a walking contrast between how she acts and how she feels. Mion is a game freak and a challenges and penalties lover; that, and the fact that she refers to herself as 'an old man', give off a tomboy aura. Despite this, Mion also has a lot of girly sides, which are mostly shown throughout the second and fifth arc, which center around her and her sister Shion.\\n\\n\r\nShion:\\n\r\nMost of the times, Shion is missing from the main, 5 club members group. However, she has an entire arc shown through her perspective. Shion's story is one of the most touching and well executed throughout the show; it clearly shows how easy it is for a person's completely logical and functional world to be thrown upside-down through a series of misunderstandings that pile up and make it crumble eventually. \\n\\n\r\nSatoko:\\n\r\nSatoko is quite a controversial character. Most of the time, she acts like an annoying brat that tries to show off \u2013 however, she also has a darker side of the story, materialized through the torments received from her (adoptive) parents and the disappearance of her brother Satoshi.   Satoko's arc might seem a bit repulsing in the beginning; however, it only gives her the right portrayal of her personality. \\n\\n\r\nRika:\\n\r\nI deliberately left Rika for the end; she's the only character that doesn't have her very own arc in the first season, and there's a good reason for that. As the first 6 scenarios suggest, there's something more that comes to Rika than her joyful 'Nii~pa' or her habit of patting the heads. \\n\\n\r\nART AND SOUND\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi's art is probably its only flaw. It certainly differs from the symmetrical, big-eyed, perfectly aligned bodies the viewer might be used to. This might seem like a turn-off in the beginning, but it actually manages to catch the unstable spirit of the anime quite well after a while. Despite this, there is a good part too: a big effort was put into backgrounds; they look realistic and flow nicely, deepening Hinamizawa's tranquility. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike the art, the sound of Higurashi is excellent. The actors did an extraordinary job managing to capture all voice fluctuations, especially the negative inducing ones. Shion's laughter is probably one of the creepiest things you'll find in an anime; Rena's 'Uso da!' will surely give you a chill down your spine; Keiichi's paranoid screams will make you paranoid as well. It's not easy portraying such a wide range of emotions, yet Higurashi doesn't fail. There's also the constant chirping of cicadas that can be heard in the background; hence the series' name. This often compensates the background music, which is only above average. OP theme is terrific, being one of the very first elements that might attract the viewer into watching the anime, since you'll just feel like listening to it countless times; still, ED might seem a bit unusual, since it's sung in (a pretty weird) English. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned before, Higurashi isn't a series for everyone. If you watch it expecting to be a horror, bloody show or just another harem, then you'll probably not like it. Higurashi's main function isn't to have horror, fanservice, tragic pasts or cute moments. Sure, it does contain its fair share of all of these; but Higurashi's purpose is to involve the viewer into a really intricate and entertaining mystery and make fun of him being fooled by fake pieces of information. If you do expect something different, however, you might just discover a hidden behind the curtain masterpiece \u2013 for Higurashi is certainly special and extremely enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nIn a world where a lot of anime series offer fans simple, almost nonexistent plots with clich\u00e9 and predictable characters, humor that's either brilliant or fail, tons of useless fanservice and many other simplicities just for the sake of existing, Higurashi certainly stands out \u2013 as being an intelligent series where a lot of effort was put into breaking the boundaries and giving the viewer an overall extremely satisfying impression and enjoyable (though often confusing) watch.",

            "content": "June 1983, a sleepy rural town in Japan. This is the auspicious setting of a tragedy that will befall a small group of classmates and their entire community. This is a tragedy that is destined to happen again, and again, and again. How and why is Hinamizawa doomed to this fate? What dark secrets does the town hold? This is a tale that seems simple on the surface but the use of character, perspective, and story-telling helps to make Higurashi one of the greatest anime ever made.\r\nThe very first episode of Higurashi can be off-putting, as it introduces a cast of characters that seem atthe time more like a collection of overused anime tropes from a slice-of-life anime than people the viewer would want to care about. Here's Keiichi, the stock new kid in town. Here's Rena, the stock girl-next-door girlfriend-type. Here's Mion, the stock tomboy. Here's Satoko, the brat. So on down the line. This is not the way people will view the characters by the end of the show, but it ends up being a smart choice to use character types that will be initially familiar to regular anime fans. The show is made much more disturbing and emotionally jarring by the juxtaposition between the light comedy parts that happen at the beginning of each story arc and the grim, violent results after events and character psyches degrade. The great contrast between the Azumanga-esque comedy bits, complete with super-deformed characters and great exaggerations, and the paranoia and psychotic murders, is one of the best artistic devices of the show. If these were dark characters more suited for a horror show, there would not have been the same emotional impact.\\n\\n\r\nStyle aside, Higurashi takes an interesting format in basically retelling the same story again and again, but changing key details and character perspectives each time to keep rehash almost nonexistent. During this first season especially, each retelling of the Hinamizawa tragedy reveals more truths behind the town, the background of the characters, and the surprisingly deep interpersonal relationships between them. Facts you learn towards the end of the season will give entirely new meaning to events you saw in the first part of the season. Each story arc peels away layers of the juicy  truth, which gives each story arc something that enhances the whole.\\n\\n\r\nEven putting aside the conclusions the viewer makes by putting the arcs together, each story arc is also its own rich self-contained story. Each time you start a new arc, the protagonist may be different. The killer may be different. The protagonist may be the victim or the killer. An arc usually focuses on one or two of the main characters and gives them their own story, subtly replacing the original image you had of them as a stock anime character with a new image of them as a fleshed-out character with a strong personality and motivations.\\n\\n\r\nWithout giving away any spoilers, the arc that begins with episode 16 is for me the highlight of Higurashi. It encapsulates everything one can love about the show. It creates great revelation about an earlier story arc. It has really intense and disturbing horror scenes (that are still tastefully done). It also is a great character study, showing how a seed of resentment and great trauma can push a normal person to the brink of madness.\\n\\n\r\nAfter having watched both seasons of Higurashi once before and knowing the entire truth, watching the show a second time still filled me with a range of emotions from laughter to sadness to horror to thoughtfulness to excitement, all delivered to great effect and in a refreshing way. If you are not a horror fan, it may be hard for you to get past some of the content, but at the same time most of the gore is just off-camera so that you can feel the disgust without it being gratuitous. For those with adult sensibilities, it is easy to fall in love with a show and a story as breathtaking and unforgettable as Higurashi no Naku Koro ni.",

            "content": "5 WORDS OR LESS REVIEW: Cute and Bloody\r\nOn the surface, Higurashi seems like a cute and moe anime that&rsquo;s chockfull of loli girls forming their own harem for the main character Keichi. It&rsquo;s not. Seriously, a small village separated from the rest of the world has &ldquo;murder&rdquo; written all over it.\r\nWho knew cutesy characters and blood would make a psychotic anime that&rsquo;s absolutely fun to watch? I&rsquo;ve always liked cute anime and violent anime but I never thought I&rsquo;d find one that incorporates both. Whoever made this into an anime knows me too well. It&rsquo;s even funny sometimes, and I love watching anime that makesme laugh. It also makes me think and come up with conclusions, another aspect I like about it. Combining all four elements I mentioned is no easy feat, and yet this anime was able to accomplish it.\\n\\n\r\nI like how the characters have split personalities. For the first episodes of each arc, they&rsquo;re all happy, cheerful and cute, then all of a sudden, they become psychos. That&rsquo;s when I think &ldquo;So this is when the real fun starts&rdquo;. My favorite character would have to be Rika Furude. She&rsquo;s so cute and innocent looking, but you can&rsquo;t help wonder if that&rsquo;s just a fa&ccedil;ade. I&rsquo;m still confused about her. She and the other girls are sort of like angels with dirty faces (or plain old schizos).\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as for the voice actors, seiyu Mai Nakahara will have to be my favorite. In the series I&rsquo;ve watched, she always played the upbeat and cheerful girl, but by playing Rena you get to hear her voice in a different way. I love how the girls&rsquo; voices change from happy to psychotic in a heartbeat.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is sort of a mixed bag. As a whole, everything looks great, specially the backgrounds. However, the character designs need some work. It&rsquo;s just too inconsistent, and there are times when the characters end up looking deformed and pretzel-like. I like the choice of color though &ndash; it&rsquo;s a fine mix of pastel hues and vibrant colors.\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM was good, but the sound effects were even better. The sound effects were very convincing, and it heightens the tension and feel of those especially violent scenes. Hearing the sound of bodies being mutilated was enough to send chills down my spine. I liked the OP very much, I have heard nothing like it before, but I like the Engrish ED too. It&rsquo;s mellow but creepy.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn&rsquo;t really a spoiler, but more of an explanation on how the storyline operates. Basically, Higurashi is divided into arcs, the longest arc had 6 episodes and the shortest had 2 episodes. In the first season, there are 4 question arcs, which pose a situation that&rsquo;s left unsolved, and there are 2 answer arcs (the other 2 will be featured in the second season), which will explain the question arcs. The 4 question and answer arcs are distinct from each other, with some constants (Rika is still the Miko, Keichi is still a transfer student, etc). I think they made the series that way because that was how the video game was.\\n\\n\r\nIf you&rsquo;re not into anime that will potentially have you scratching your head, then this isn&rsquo;t for you, but I urge everyone who reads this review to give Higurashi a try, because in all honesty it is one of the best series I&rsquo;ve seen in my life.",

            "content": "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is a Psychological, Horror, Mystery anime unlike any other, as it is easy to get hooked on it. The story is incredible because it does something I haven&rsquo;t seen before, by splitting the series into various arcs, each telling a different story. Each of these arcs are somewhat linked with each other, as they provide the viewer with different questions and try to give an answer. What&rsquo;s more interesting is how each story slowly builds up to its climax. I found it amazing how each retelling gave me a different feel and how a lot of things were finally piecedtogether. The only problem is that it can be very confusing for people watching this show for the first time, but this just promotes its re-watch value.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters for this anime are what deceive you, into a false sense of security, as someone who may not much about it will think of this as a harem (1 guy + cute girls). However these mysterious characters help bring genuine fear, to those who watch this, as you just don&rsquo;t know what to expect when you add mental instability to the mix.  \\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that lets this anime down was the animation, as it is incredibly inconsistent. There was very little detail put into the character designs but worse was the disfigured faces as a means of portraying insanity. Nonetheless the animation was pretty fluid and the characters facial expressions were fairly frightening, to suit this creepy anime. The music does a great job in setting the right moods, with creepy melodies to go with eerie tone and sinister music when someone&rsquo;s being bludgeoned to death.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it&rsquo;s hard to find a series that that portrays a murder mystery as well as this one; as it perfectly executes suspense, climax and shocking moments to make it exciting to watch. It was quite troubling that it left a lot of questions unanswered, but that is what the 2nd season is for. The real problem was how poorly executed the ending was, as it didn&rsquo;t make the slightest bit of sense. Taking that into account, the overall feeling got from watching this anime isn&rsquo;t lost. So I recommend Higurashi no Naku Koro ni to any anime fan, who can handle a bit of mind torture.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "I never showed any interest towards this anime but a lot of people seemed to like it because of its unique approach. So I thought, why not give this a try? To be honest, I still don't know what to think about Higurashi... \r\nLet me start by saying this anime is divided in arcs counting 4 to 6 episodes each approx. Each arc tells a different story (though I'm not sure they really were different) and the last two arcs seem to explain the events in the previous arcs. I didn't like this idea but why not give it a try? Well, my main reasonwhy -not- to watch this again is because the first 3 to 4 arcs are practically the same and bored me for about 13 episodes. I only enjoyed the horror moments which unfortunately were few. After the first half the arcs did get better and the explanatory arcs were nice, but this isn't all that bothered me about Higurashi. \\n\\n\r\nHow on earth did the producers come up with such annoying characters?! I'm not the kind of person to be easily annoyed by characters but boy! Never have I seen such unsteady characters. Even the ever expanding chaotic universe is more steady then Keiichi and his friends. I also couldn't stand the voice actors, they didn't sound believable at any point throughout the series. The animation didn't exactly help out here. Scenery and backgrounds were nicely done but I didn't enjoy the character designs. The facial expressions didn't impress me a lot either, except for when the characters got angry. They did a good job there.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say I liked the development of the story since the first few arcs are truly retellings of similar stories. I still don't know what happened and what didn't, but the final two arcs were a big improvement so I am interested in watching the second season: Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai. The comedy throughout the story wasn't exactly my cup of thee either. The place the story takes place in and the side elements, however, do speak to the viewers imagination. A little town where people desperately believe in their god who happens to enjoy torturing people,.. it's the perfect settlement for a psychological horror anime.\\n\\n\r\nConcerning the soundtrack, I didn't like the opening nor the ending song. Again a bummer. Also its animation wasn't what it could or should have been. I only remember the cicadas crying from the first till the last episode, so there's little to talk about the music. \\n\\n\r\nHigurashi didn't disappoint me since I didn't expect a lot from it, however I will watch the second season hoping for a reasonable amount of horror and some decent storytelling. If only the characters would have been better developed I would have enjoyed this a lot more, but a bunch of insecure children trying to act tough just don't get to me. Funny enough the supporting characters were more convincing and are probably what kept me watching.",

            "content": "Although i do not usually find myself watching much anime of this kind, with it's violence and gore, Higurashi  no Naku Koro ni (as well as the subsequent second season) has had me hooked from the very beginning.\r\nSo, where do i begin? Right from the very first the story has you thrown, the opening few sequences quell your thirst as you watch the first of many entangled mysteries, involving the initial main character  Keiichi Maebara play out a horrific opening few minutes.\r\nAll of the main characters remain likeable, this despite the stories and events that unfold. Unlike much other anime, where the storyunravels gently as the episodes flow, Higurashi cleverly (and at times annoyingly) allows you to observe whats is essentially the same story many times over, each time with differing events and consequences. These seem at first unrelated however as the series goes on we find the stories cleverly intertwining themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself in the first series is composed mainly of the 4 question arcs, each of which takes the viewer down the same path and ultimately the same end, each time a different character becomes embroiled in tragedy, with a big climax ensuing as each arc ends. There are also the first 2 answer arcs, which allow the viewer to see some of the reasons behind the stories and events, but never revealing enough for complete understanding.\\n\\n\r\nHow is the music you ask? The musical accompaniment is excellent and captures the emotions of all the key points throughout the series, as i write this i am in fact listening to Higurashi soundtrack music. The opening intro (name same as series itself) becomes very quickly catchy, and whilst the end theme 'Why, or why not?' is not my cup of tea, it is a very appropriate song.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one 'flaw' in the series it is some of the background art, which seems a little bit under detailed at times, however this never has or never will spoil my vast enjoyment of this series (and indeed of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai, the second season). The ending episode is also a masterpiece of storytelling, yet it still withholds much of the answers from it's viewers, leaving you wanting yet more. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the series is excellent and well worth a watch, even if the excess violence isn't your cup of tea it is used very well to tie in with the storylines, not just senselessly thrown in for effect.\\n\\n\r\nNot quite my favorite anime (Ranma 1/2 will forever have my heart on that one) but certainly my favorite watch this summer, highly recommended.\\n\\n\r\nSephSora\\n\\n",

            "content": "So yes this is a nice harem Anime, oh wait, this is supposed to be a horror? You sure could have fooled me. In terms of horror and suspense Higurashi is a complete and utter failure. Elfen Lied has nothing to fear now, it still probably can top this. Okay seriously I am very disappointed in this series, considering I wanted a good suspense thriller that wasn't based purely on 100% excess and shock-factoring like Elfen Lied.\r\nHigurashi is a story of several different arcs. Each arc is a different version of the same story. In 1983 a young male transfer student comes to a smalltown. A town with a deadly secret. Apparently after a traditional summer festival one person will be killed and another will disappear. The story repeats in the same fashion through each arc usually ending in a brutal murder or murders of some one or some people, but something.\\n\\n\r\nAs wonderful as the plot sounds it really isn't. The series had immense potential to create a suspenseful masterpiece, but instead it's like watching a toss away filler arc, that repeats its self until something finally happens after 6 episodes. Each episode is as long winded and wordy as the next. Oh but don't get me wrong, eventually something does happen, but when it FINALLY does it provides maybe a few minutes of fright but that's it, and when it finally does it's a very clich&eacute;d horror blunder trick comprised of a very cheesy sound effect that sounds like they are crushing tomatoes, and a cheesy cut out that either goes red or black.  \\n\\n\r\nThis series seriously lacks suspense, half the time you feel more like you are watching a slice-of-life comedy instead of a thriller. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then the story continues again and starts out the same, we're in the school house, they act like we don't know any of the character by now, and then some annoying detective shows up again to go over the SAME mystery we heard 5 episodes ago!  How many times do I have to be told the little girl's parents were ran out of the village because of a damming project and that the brother's bat has gone missing.   I feel like I'm watching Pokemon, with the same thing different day style it's done over the last 10 years.  \\n\\n\r\nThe series can work up it's suspense and chill level especially with the chirping cicadas that provide an almost melodic atmosphere, but fails to keep it long enough for us to get remotely interested. The whole time you are just questioning should I fast-forward or not?  Even when in my jumping through episodes and reading further spoilers, I find the series doesn't go anywhere else, it's a bad version of Ground Hog Day with out the comedy, and the Blair Which Project, with out the suspense. \\n\\n\r\nSure I like a talky as much as the next guy maybe even more than the next guy, but excessive dialog simply doesn't usually work well in a thriller.  The only time I have seen it work, was Madlax. The series tries to build and build but the suspense just keeps falling down again.  \\n\\n\r\nBut there are a few eerie moments, (key word being few) such as the wonderful psychotic laughter from the tiny little ones. (see: http://tinyurl.com/2w5tll) and when it finally does get to the horrifying climax it can give you a few chills, before it abruptly cuts off. Other than that, the series heavily relies on it's dialog and music to give any sense of a creepy atmosphere. And that is all it has going for it.\\n\\n\r\nI can't express how dull of a horror this really was. Die hard horror lovers may want to stick to Elfen Lied, as for the general suspense lovers (Like me) who want suspense and less gore, you may want to avoid this one. \\n\\n\r\nApparently when cicadas cry, this horror dies.  The only thing decent about this show was the  opening theme.  The sound effects sound cheesy and really childish.  Higurashi is basically a suspenseful melodrama with out the suspense.",

It\\'s a story about a group of kids, and the evil secrets that lies underneath the surface of their small town. Every year during a festival a mysterious  murder accurs. at the same time someone else goes missing without a trace.  \r\nThis story is actually made of several completely seperate but loosely related story arcs. At the begining of each things are almost exactly the same each time. They all start right before the festival begins and follows through the mysterious killings and to the conclusion of what acctually happened. Andit\\'s always the same person who gets killed and the same person who goes missing. The diffences come in the hows and whys (Kind of like the end of the movie \\'Clue\\' &quot;This is how it could have happened...&quot;) . The past events and explainations for the deaths are completely different everytime. And in the end you are left wondering what really happened.\\n\\n\r\nIt\\'s a pyschological thriller, and overall a very twisted anime. It will have you shaking your head  asking yourself, &quot;What the.....?&quot; and running in fear of any girl under the age of ten.  So needless to say I highly recommend it.\\n",

            "content": "First off, a word of advice.  Do not judge this show by the first episode. \r\nIt starts off like your standard anime with several lighthearted moments all the way through the first episode.  However, you&rsquo;d be a fool to think that this is all there is to it. This is not that type of show.  Higurashi masterfully combines physiological, mystery, horror and comedy in a way that is simply remarkable.  The anime is mind breaking and murderously genius.  It is so brilliant and unique that it&rsquo;s almost criminal to not give it the credit it deserves.\r\nIt takes physiological and horrorto a different level, it makes you feel secured using lighthearted moments to give the audience a feeling of false security.  The next thing you know, you might be looking right at death and despair.  Trust me, it will happen.  \\n\\n\r\nThe main five characters are Keiichi, Rena, Mion, Satoko and Rika. They all play important roles in the series and their actions throughout each chapter decide the outcome of the Arc (good or bad ending).  They all seem to lead carefree lives in Hinamizawa but in reality, they all possess a much darker and sadder history behind them than they appear to have.  Throughout the series, they somehow get involved several times with Oyashiro-sama&rsquo;s curse (the local God) and unfortunate chain of events are triggered every time.  \\n\\n\r\nThe anime/manga is divided into &ldquo;Arcs&rdquo; or Chapters (-hen).  The first part of the anime are the &ldquo;Question Arcs&rdquo;, showing us the mysterious deaths, Oyashiro-sama&rsquo;s curse, and the mystery behind the bizarre town of Hinamizawa.  The second part, &ldquo;Answer Arcs&rdquo;, provides us with answers to several events that happen in the first part.  The events in the following arcs may seem similar but the way in which they unfold and the events are quite different than the past arcs.  Additionally, throughout the series there are plenty of clues, speculations and theories that are hinted to help you solve the mysteries behind the town.  It is imperative to pay great attention to them and you&rsquo;ll see that the mystery behind the town of Hinamizawa slowly unwraps. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the music in Higurashi (Kai) perfectly fits the anime. The opening song &ldquo;When they Cry&rdquo; flawlessly portrays the dark, raging, and murderous feeling of the anime while contrasting it with scenes of serenity, sorrow and uncertainty.  Similarly, the ending theme &ldquo;Why or why Not?&rdquo; and the other OST songs are calm and pleasant to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro Ni is a show that should not missed, nonetheless, it is not a show for the overly sensitive, feint hearted, and simple minded due to the bloody scenes and complexity of the show itself.  If you are not into physiological-mystery or cannot handle graphic scenes you will not enjoy to the fullest and you will fail to appreciate it.   If you are looking for an incredibly unique, very complex and extremely engaging show, this anime is right for you.\\n",

            "content": "The first reason I came across Higurashi no Naku Koro ni was in an animation icon in which I saw a very graphic and disturbing scene and even though it was only about 8 seconds long, it was enough to have me hooked and this was because of what I could see - something insane happened, someone else was there, they were shocked, but then they looked liked they laughed insanely, probably out of fear and being psychotic, I presumed, but I had no idea what it was! I looked for a bit, but did not find it and about two weeks ago I finallydid come across it, found the name and began watching and I will say that within the first 20 seconds I was hooked.\\n\\n\r\nI do have a rather disturbing view on animes such as this, as well as others that are mature, violent and have tragic, jealous love stories - they are my favorites if done correctly and this one is done amazingly and that is only one part of what I love. There are an assortment of murders, but you are never sure what to believe or what to think, nor what is good and what is wrong and they are all done for the best reasons - the reasons that I look for in anime, books, movies and anything else because they are the true human emotions - love, jealousy, family, fear, protectiveness of those that you love, abuse, sibling love, first love, first crushes and everything else that makes a person what they are. Things that would be precious memories are nothing more than a myriad of blurs and confusion in which the main character sometimes does not know what is real and neither does the viewer. If you can top a psychological thriller with supernatural elements, then I am in my glory and this anime does just that.\\n\\n\r\nAforementioned, the first moments of the anime immediately will let you know if you can stand this kind of anime or not - a lot of is done like the beginning, which you see a rather vague vision of a guy beating something on the ground most likely to death with what looks like a bat, but you have no idea why, obviously and you do not see the actual beating, it is left to the imagination and much of the anime is like this and if you have an active imagination like me, filled with theories, then this anime is perfect for you!\\n\\n\r\nOnce the shocking beginning is over, if you are still watching and did not get disturbed and turn away from your screen, you are put into the normal setting for an anime - or so you think. You see a bunch of beautiful girls that look very different and act very different, as well, and the main character guy that was just doing the beating in the beginning, and they are all in school having a dandy time.\\n\\n\r\nBy now, you already know that this is not a happy, simple anime, so nothing obviously is what it seems and your mind immediately starts racing as to what just happened and if the violence started so soon, when could the next thing happen and it could literally happen at any moment!\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters live in a tiny little village away from main cities and civilization and they only have about 2,000 people in the entire town. The school where the main characters go is nothing more than one classroom which houses all the students in the town, from grade-school to high school, all in one classroom and there are only 15 students altogether, so once you learn this, you are creeped out even more because this is a very unique and disturbing setting. The town is in the middle of a beautiful, huge forest and the whole area is very majestic and isolated.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline of this anime is so intricate and woven that it really is hard to explain in words and I sat for a while before even trying to write this. You will want to watch the scenes again to make sure you didn't miss anything and so many things will rush through your head when you watch this anime because so many things happen unexpectedly and you have no idea why. \\n\\n\r\nContrary to what I thought, there isn't really an awful lot of actual violence on screen and the first animation I saw was one of the worst ones in the anime. However! There are a ton of different horrific things that happen, but you only get to see the beginning of them for most of the anime and your mind is left to figure out everything else, but really is hard to do!\\n\\n\r\nFor me, once again, this anime was perfect. I love watching things where you have to think and have theories and it makes your mind work, and this anime does just that. I was constantly trying to figure out what was happening and who was really who and even though I was right a lot of the time, when I was right, it was just totally more disturbing because the things I thought were very creepy.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a psychological supernatural thriller. There are very horrible things that happen very often, but you, the viewer are left to figure out what is real and what is not and who is really in the wrong and in the right. The first season of the anime covers four question arcs and two answer arcs, where the second season will hopefully finish the rest up.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors... oh, the voice actors were possibly among the best I have ever heard and they were totally satisfying for reach situation. Sometimes someone screams in a situation or laughs insanely, but they are not good at it - that is not the case in Higurashi. All the voice actors are extremely talented at their roles and most of them will actually give you chills at one point or another.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the art! The facial expressions and the different ways the characters eyes would change were absolute genius and I loved how the screen would slowly go over to their faces, so that you, the viewer, would have to wonder what their expression would be - would the character be sane at the moment, or would they be out of their mind? They also did not only have one expression for when people were upset and mad and insane, there were many different expressions for the different characters - they all have their own personal insanities!\\n\\n\r\nThe music is absolutely awesome for the anime. I got two of the soundtracks afterwards and have been listening to them non-stop. The music goes perfectly with the anime and sometimes it's happy, but generally it's creepy, psychotic, mysterious and makes you very nervous and scared, but it's also beautifully done. The opening theme will capture you and drag you in and you will have it stuck in your head non-stop and trust me, that is a good thing because it is awesome!\\n\\n\r\nI highly suggest this anime to anyone that liked animes such as Elfen Lied, which is another of my favorites. This anime is now among my favorites and I highly await watching the sequel, which I have not started yet and I am so happy to have come across this anime, I will admit... I LOVE THIS ANIME!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nTime to mix things up and review something good for a change. Today I will be reviewing Higurashi no naku koro ni/Kai. Do your best crazed evil laugh and read on if you dare!\r\nWARNING: Mild spoilers! Nothing major, but it is difficult to talk about the story or characters without saying something. If you haven't seen Higurashi and want to go in to it knowing absolutely nothing, please skip this review!\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe story takes place in the small, rural town of Hinamizawa. The story takes place in the 1980s, but Hinamizawa looks like its stuck in the 1950s or earlier. This is no ordinary smalltown though, because great evil is afoot and supernatural forces are at play. Plans for an American film adaptation quickly fell through, but I'm sure the American version would inevitably take place in the state of Maine. The first episode begins with Keichi (the bear Jew) Meibara brutally beating his classmates to death with a baseball bat. After the scene fades to black, we find everyone is alive again and it is as if none of it ever happened. Welcome to the madness of Higurashi! For little Rika Furude, a shinto priestess of the tiny village, death is never the end. Every time she dies, she wakes up a month or so earlier and must relive the same month before being killed again. Each alternate timeline has small differences that often ultimately result in large differences. Rika is like Bill Murray's Character in Groundhog's day, only instead of having to become a good person, she must find out who keeps killing her (the one thing she isn't allowed to remember) and protect her village from an unspeakably evil bioweapons expert who is essentially the lovechild of Shiro Ishii and Josef Mengele. I won't give away any more of the plot, since mystery is a large part of this series. I will say that this is a bizarre plot that takes the viewer on a wild ride you are unlikely to forget.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is Rika Furude, who appears to be the most adorable little girl in existence, but in reality is extremely depressed from her Sisyphean quest the Gods have given her. She has failed and died hundreds of times when we first see her, which is why there is something a little...off about her. She copes with her fate by being a complete wino. As an amusing sidenote, her favorite wine is Bernkastel, which is a white wine, yet in the anime it is always shown as a red wine. Other characters include the bossy,  self acclaimed leader Mion, Adorable Rena, mischievous Satoko, sometimes crazy Shion, and resident average straight man (comedy term, not talking about sexuality) Keichii. We also have some other quirky characters like the always creepy and possibly pedophilic Dr. Irie, and complete BADASS cop Akasaka. Obviously I'm not going to mention who the villain is, only that he/she is one EVIL motherfucker.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is often creepy, haunting, and plays up the tension of the mood. This is often a grim series, so you would expect a pretty dark sound track. There are also very silly scenes, and the soundtrack does a good job of capturing them as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art from the visual novels is legendarily bad. The art in the anime is actually pretty good. It isn't the greatest I have ever seen, but it is very solid.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is a series that will make you cringe in horror, cheer with excitement, laugh, question, shiver, and maybe even tear up a bit. It is the total package and over the course of 50 episodes is an epic roller coaster you don't want to miss.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDo you like horror? Psychological drama? Mystery? Higurashi is the series for you! This combines many genre's together with elegance and grace. Some people know of this series only as, \"that series with crazy laughs and bloody murders\", but it is SO much more than that. I would highly recommend watching it. Although you may have difficulty buying it on DVD in the US. At 200$ for 50 episodes, it is one of the most expensive series to own in all of existence! I know exactly 1 person that actually owns this series!\\n\\n",

            "content": "What the fuck did I just watch? I don't know , so I decided to make a review about it.\r\nThis show contains scenes of graphic lolita violence , as well as numerous murders commit by green haired girls. If your hearth is weak or you dislike seeing a river of blood coming out of a person's neck , you might want to stop reading and head to over to watch Kyoro-chan.\r\nOk , now all the girls and sissy men have left , let's take our magical briefs and jump right into the bloody mess of confusion called Higurashi.\r\nThe anime contains all the required otaku elementsfor the creation  of harem oxide. The elements in question are : twin sister , a compound of two lolis , a moe neutron (she always uses the phrase \"I wanna take it home\" , which implies she wants to form a covalent bond with a certain chemical) and a gay carbon atom.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime also introduces the concept of different dimensions which means love shapes such as love triangles and rectangles can turn into love cubes and triangular prisms.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is made of reusing  the same goddamn concept without explaining jackshit , each alliteration of the crimes is basically a spin-off show of the other - one of the characters goes loko and kills everyone.Hooray!\\n\r\nThe story is divided into 3 parts : the question arcs ( also knows as the 'WTF arc') , the answer arcs (also known as 'MINDFUCK arc\") and the filler arcs (also known as the 'actual plot').\\n\\n\r\nAfter finding out that K wasn't the main character I couldn't help but feel that the whole anime was designed for the single purpose of trolling the viewers. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime takes place in a village called Hinamizawa , which is situated in the upper middle equatorial subhemisphere of the pacific indian ocean. The village lacks any technology , which makes the villagers very frustrated as they are unable to fulfill their anime-related desires. When such an otaku is deprived of moe for too long he starts to develop what is called the Hinamizawa syndrome. It's basically like having suicidal intent but instead of having a clean death by hanging yourself , they use their nails to chop of their own necks. Lovely. The moral? Never take anime away from an otaku - he is going to break your kneecaps and then rip your hearth out to show it to you. Then proceed to shove it down your throat just to steal it AGAIN.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLike most viewers , I was very pleased to see some characters die. \\n\\n\r\n......\\n\\n\r\nHowever.\\n\\n\r\n......\\n\\n\r\nTHEY JUST WON'T STAY DEAD.     DIE BITCHES- DIE. \\n\\n\r\nI mean seriously , in MY anime , people DIE WHEN THEY ARE KILLED.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNot this anime , oh no. Logic won't work here , the only way to understand the work of a troll is to become one! \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are BUTTS. \\n\r\nBadass\\n\r\nUltimate\\n\r\nTranquil\\n\r\nTerminators\\n\r\nSalami!\\n\\n\r\nSo here they are in all their glory:\\n\\n\r\nMaebara 'K' Keichii - A man must have big balls to go through a populated village in a maid suit. When you start the anime you might think : \" Oh this guy looks like a complete loser - surely he must be the main character. And oh look is that Harem member #1? \" But no , fuck you Ryukishi07 , misleading us like that.\\n\\n\r\nSonozaki Shion and Mion - They trolled us by [huge fucking spoiler ahead] ....... having green hair. Also they are very similar in appearance - I just can't seem to figure out why. Uncle Mion is just there for no good reason , all she does is stay behind K and use her green hair to blend in with the trees around her.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRyuugu Rena - Why does the writer think it was a good idea to make a moe character stronger than Aizen? I mean she could K.O John Cena using her pinky . Not only that but she is also a kleptomaniac  ( aka she steals everything she finds cute - like the dead remains of zombie or a deathly hallow laying in a far away forest) and further more she often implies that she wants to kidnap children ( pedophilia) and take home K's manhood ( I am not even sure how to categorize this .... reverse rape? ).\\n\\n\r\nHojou Satako - A bunch of fucking traps made by this kid destroyed a whole professional military squad. Does this mean the Hinamizawa Branch School 's After School Games Club could effectively declare war to Japan and eventually conquer the whole fucking planet? \\n\\n\r\nRika Furude - She is a completely unimportant character - she has no relevant role in the story , she is not the actual main character and I guarantee she is not a person capable of traveling through different dimensions in any way. Seriously - that would be the mindfuck of the century - a loli for a main character and more so a WOMAN? Blasphemy!\\n\\n\r\nTomitake Jirou - He comes , takes a few pictures and then drops dead.\\n\\n\r\nTakano Miyo - She always dies in a fire probably.....\\n\\n\r\nAkasaka - Not wearing a shirt while piloting robots and wearing sunglasses that make you look like a fucking retard doesn't make you manly. Kicking ass at a vital point in the plot by nonchalantly rescuing the main character tends to have that effect.\\n\\n\r\nOoishi - 20 years of full time donut eating career made him wider than standard door width. His speed exponentially increases when he rolls on his stomach rather then using his tiny legs. Has a detective tie so I guess he is a detective.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo those are all the characters that are worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nLike all of Ryukishi07's works , the name of the anime involves crying - I guarantee that you will cry tears of happiness when Rika takes a chair and proceeds to beat the living crap out of Satoko.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is actually an animation of the visual novel made by the most trollastic company in the industry - 07 Expansion ( no relation with 07 ghost or 007) - and all I can say is thanks god they didn't copy the ENOURMOS hands the characters have because that would make the anime to easy to figure out - the Hinamizawa syndrome makes your hands bigger so you can more efficiently claw your throat.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime will most likely leave you scarred for the rest of your life. You are going to constantly check your food for needles , mistake markers for syringes and randomly make references:\\n\\n\r\nTeacher : \"There are only 8 planets in the solar system - Pluto  is not  a real pla--\"\\n\r\nYou : USODAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about Watanagashi . What the fuck is Watanagashi?  \\n\r\nIt's a festival where those dumbwits throw their junk into the river which is why there is no sweetfish in the river (get this reference and I will personally email you a napkin) - they basically take their old fridges and old corpses from the basement and throw them in the river . This is done as to purify themselves - even tho I fail to see how throwing garbage is an excuse for being a duchebag. If I was the king of Hinamizawa I would most certainly construct the most unethical harem ever created and the Watanagashi would basically be a huge paintball game - only instead of paint - we use actual m47 shotguns - HOORAY!\\n\\n\r\nBut enough about blowing heads off , tell me , do you regulary cut your nails? No? Then what are you waiting for? Come Hinamizawa's Nail Remover Shop - it's as easy as putting your hand in an apparatus which strips your nails in the most painful way possible! If you call now , we will remove not 3 , not 4 , but 5 NAILS AT THE PRICE OF ONE! If you make a reservation we will even take a picture of your agonized face that you can share with your friends! Nail Remover (tm) is fun for the whole family! Don't stand there like an idiot - call now! \\n\r\nThis review was broght to you by Sonozaki Tortures (R).\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure we all enjoy a good torture , especially after a bath in boling water , but we must think about less fortunate people , who don't have the resources to get a quality torture. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere are three anime arcs:\\n\\n\r\n1. No Naku Koro Ni (\"McDonalds Arc\")\\n\r\nOnikakushi-hen ( \"Milkshake Drinking Chapter\")\\n\r\nWatanagashi-hen (\"Fried Fish Chapter\")\\n\r\nTatarigoroshi-hen (\"McChicken Eating Chapter\")\\n\r\nHimatsubushi-hen (\"Mascot Killing Chapter\")\\n\\n\r\n2.Kai (\"Filler Arc\")\\n\r\nMeakashi-hen (\"Celestial Squirrel Chapter\")\\n\r\nTsumihoroboshi-hen (\"Octopus Riding Chapter\")\\n\r\nMinagoroshi-hen (\"Reverse Harem Chapter\")\\n\r\nMatsuribayashi-hen (\"Haruhi Worshipping Chapter\")\\n\\n\r\n3. Rei (\"Pockemon Arc\")\\n\r\nSaikoroshi-hen (\"Pikachu Choosing Chapter\")\\n\r\nBatsukoishi-hen (\"Charizard Choosing Chapter\")\\n\r\nHirukowashi-hen (\"Bulbasaur Choosing Chapter\")\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe moral of the story is not to give up hope just because it's hopeless and punch fate in the face. However we all know , hard work is overrated - I'd much rather sit on my ass all day.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is forced to repeat her life all over again , never being able to get past June  , now - I don't know what the fuck she is complaining about - just imagine the POSSIBILITIES. You could eat all you want , be over 150kg and then BOOM , back to being a fucking sack of bones  - you could kill the president of 4kids all over again and watch every single anime ever created. You don't have to study because you've already done your homework a few hundred times and so you eating icecream while watching a Haruhi Suzumiya special for ALL ETERNITY. No pain , no side effects . Although if you are actually inside a game controlled by witches you might get your ass handed but that would be just silly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe school those guys are attending to is just ridiculous , it's basically a hut with only one class , one teacher and one chair (which can be used as a weapon). The whole building is surrounded by vegetation where wolfs often look for preys. That's why leaving and going to school is often regarded as a struggle for your life.\\n\\n\r\nOyashiro-sama (Pi-mp-G-o-d) is the deity of the village , like all loving gods he often kills people that are sexier then her (all tho I'm not sure why Tomitake was killed). tHE name of this demonic creature is Hanyuu - her favorite food is cream puffs and tofu and she doesn't like spicy foods. But don't be fooled - she will smugger you with a pillow in your sleep.\\n\\n\r\nMaids were supposed to be a major plot device in this anime , sadly Keiichi is the only one. Just imagine his parents surprise when he gets home late in a maid suit  , they must've been speechless.\\n\\n\r\nKeichi     : I'm hoooome!\\n\r\nMother : \"Welcome home , swee-........ah......um , dear come here a second....\"\\n\r\nFather  : \"Is it that son of mine again? Has he----....\"\\n\r\nKeichi    : \" Problem , father?\"\\n\r\nFather :\"I am disapoint , son ---------you would look much better in a nurse suit\"\\n\r\nKeichi :\"Huh???\"\\n\r\nMother :\" He looks just like you when you were younger , dear. Guess the transvestite genes run in your family.\"\\n\r\nKeichi :\" THE FUCK?\"\\n\r\nFather :\"Dunno , I looked much more moe - remember when I confessed to you while wearing a bikini?\"\\n\r\nMother : \" How could I forget , you did it in front of the whole school\"\\n\r\nKeichi: \"Father , Mother , this is a misunderstanding , it's a punishment ga-\"\\n\r\nFather :\" Son.\"\\n\r\nKeichi :\"W-what is it?\"\\n\r\nFather :\" You have been trolled :))))\"\\n\r\nKeichi : FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd thus we have come to a conclusion in our journey to understand this zombie pile of flying bee-weasels . I am pretty sure reading this review will serve you well during the Armageddon as you will need plenty of chairs to bring down the army of human eating time vampires ( you know , like those from twilight and other failed books).\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI lift my arm up , and gently touch the surface of the toast with the butter soaked knife which will fabricate the delicious combination that is my breakfast. The flagrant texture of the bread has been refined by the hot and entrancing flames of hell from the toaster and shall serve as a tool to satisfy my culinary needs for this sorrow morning of sunday. The hot surface of the toast would incinerate any life form and melt even the strongest metal - but fear not , for I have the only true god in the palm of my hand. I fold the napkin and use it to grab the incandescent toast and raise it at a comfortable 45 degrees angle while slightly opening my mouth. Time passes as the toast seems to challenge me - I hold the napkin like my life depends on it and quiver the shape of my mouth in to a round hole to attempt to cool down the infernal toast , as the cold air travels towards the toast it reaches the surface of hell and emits a monster of steam that envelops my hand - but I'm not afraid because the napkin protects me. I bow my head forward. And then I like flippin' chew on the goddamn toast LOL\\n\\n\r\nI hope you have enjoyed reading this. Because if you didn't you are gonna see me in your nightmares dressed in a maid suit and holding a rose in my mouth.l will then proceed to cover your body in honey and make a bear lick it off.\\n\\n\r\nBut no pressure , feel free to rate this review unhelpful . But before you do that , I advise you to say farewell to your loved ones.\\n\\n\r\nHave a nice day!\\n",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW FOR BOTH SEASONS OF THE SHOW**\r\nEver heard of the phrase \u201cDon\u2019t judge a book by its cover?\u201d Well, Higurashi no naku koro ni is an anime that takes this saying to a whole \u2018nother level. One minute you think you are watching some sort of K-ON clone, the next you are hiding under the covers and cringing at the horrific violence flashing across your screen. If that isn\u2019t enough of a hint, let me preface this review by elucidating the fact that this anime is not for everybody; the sheer amount of blood, gore, and bone-chilling imagery ensures that fact. It's bestthat the faint of heart pass on this one. However, Higurashi is so much more then the mindless scares and random violence that so many horror shows divulge into; it is a masterfully written, well-thought-out, psychological thriller based around an enthralling mystery that keeps you guessing from beginning to end, and it is absolutely fantastic at just about everything it does.\\n\\n\r\nGiving a proper synopsis for Higurashi\u2019s plot is completely pointless because this isn\u2019t the kind of show you can explain properly to people who haven\u2019t seen it. To elaborate, this anime is based on a visual novel, and rather then focusing the entire show on a single arc, you get to see ALL of the arcs. What this means is that there is a lot jumping around in chronology; characters will die in one arc only to come back to life in the next, but it is easy to detect that something is very, very wrong with the town of Hinamizawa. Keichi Maebara and his friends seem like normal teenagers in every arc, but something always seems to go horribly wrong and one or more characters will completely lose their minds. This brings us to the real strength of Higurashi's storyline: The element of mystery. Viewers are constantly trying to figure out what is causing these seemingly innocent characters straight out of a slice-of-life harem anime to suddenly go insane and start slaughtering everything in sight, only to have their theory blown out of the water during the next arc. Not only do these mysteries maintain several layers of intrigue throughout both seasons, they are well written. The reason I enjoy this anime so much is because everything comes together beautifully. By the end, everything you were initially confused about will have made sense and been resolved in a fantastically satisfying manner, no matter how confused you get along the way. Really the only complaint I can make about the storyline is that the pacing of the second season is a bit slow, but considering that the pacing of the rest of the show literally could not be any more perfect, that\u2019s just a nitpick. There is also a minor detail in one of the arcs that never gets explained; you'll have to look it up on the Internet to figure out the explanation, but it's nothing too major. Again, this is nit-picky stuff. All in all, FANTASTIC plot, especially considering that this is a horror show; a genre that is usually shallow.\\n\\n\r\nThe beauty of the characters in Higurashi doesn't necessarily lie in their character development; in fact, Higurashi leaves quite a lot to be desired when it comes to character development. The reason these characters work is because they are all relatable, they are all likable in some way or another, and they are incredibly entertaining to watch. Keichi is a stereotypical protagonist both in design and personality; I recognize that he is nothing special, but he actually has a lot of redeeming qualities that shine through especially in the second season. Also, he has a bit of a dark and disturbing past (NOT in the stereotypical \"my parents died!\" sense that you are probably thinking) that adds another layer of intrigue to him. Mion and Shion Sonozaki, on the other hand, are extremely entertaining to watch and absolutely steal the show, especially a particular one of those two. That is because she is by far the most fun character to watch \"snap\" (almost every character \"snaps\" at some point in some arc). She goes from an adorable, innocent girl to absolute psychopath. In one particular arc, this character will just leave you speechless with her cruelty and brutality; these sisters are truly some of the most memorable characters in anime if you ask me. I won\u2019t go over Rena, Rika, Satako, or the awesome side characters for the sake of time, but consider this: All of the characters in Higurashi are very fleshed out and have depth to them; most of them don\u2019t receive much development due to the fact that this is a show where we are constantly going back in time (every time an arc ends), so true development is next to impossible. However, if Steins;Gate taught us anything, it is that we don\u2019t necessarily need to see change in characters in order for them to work, and Higurashi is another example of that. These characters are all likable, distinct, and they have fantastic chemistry with one another. That makes them very successful in my book.\\n\\n\r\nSome people are very critical of Higurashi's art style, but I absolutely fell in love with the animation of this anime by the end of the very first arc for one simple reason: No anime in existence has ever executed contrast as beautifully and expertly as Higurashi did. One moment the animation will look like it's an over-the-top, moe, slice of life comedy, the next moment, it looks like a dark, stylized, bloodbath. It is executed to near perfection, and the viewers never, EVER forget the incredibly powerful facial expressions of the characters. Sure, the dialogue scenes can be sub-par and the character design is nothing special, but the execution is good enough to repent for these things. The soundtrack is the perfect compliment to the anime. It is uplifting and happy when it needs to be and dark/sinister/frightening when it needs to be. Throw in the show's iconic opening and you have yourself a great soundtrack, especially when you throw in the excellent voice acting. Satsuki Yukino provides what I believe to be one of the best voice acting performances in history with her unbelievably wide range of emotion as the voices of the Sonozaki twins. However, it is worth noting that the English dub for Higurashi is absolutely atrocious. It was so bad that they didn't even bother to dub the 2nd season. Needless to say, stick to sub on this one.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I absolutely LOVE Higurashi. Something about watching stereotypical slice of life comedy characters go insane and start butchering each other is just unbelievably appealing to me, but that's not all there is to this series; it is incredibly well written and will have you on the edge of your seat for its entirety. As I mentioned earlier, this anime is not for everyone, but if you are mature enough to handle it, it's a fantastic thrill ride that I highly recommend.",

            "content": "Watching Higurshi is like locking a group of happy people in a test chamber, only coming back to find they've hacked each other into a bloody mess. Its horrific, its shocking, and yet a part of you, cannot help but wonder, how did it happen?\nThe curiosity takes over... and so you repeat the experiment, knowing full well that those cute looking teenagers you just sent are going to end up as bloody pulps. But hey, at least each time they die, you're one step closer to figuring out why they died, it's all good.\nHigurashi essentially places you in the role of the scientist. It dividesitself into several arcs, each of which begin exactly the same. A teenager moves into a remote countryside village, and befriends a group of sweet fangirls that could have come out right from a harem rom/com. Then, explicably, thing go wrong... very wrong. \\n\\n\nThe pacing is excellent, the suspence pulpable. You know terrible things are going to happen, but you don't know exactly what. Higurashi would appeal to two types of people. The maglomanics who cackle madly in seeing a happy community descend into the depth of oblivion, and the curious scientist who watched each arc with intense interest... for they want to know exact *why* everything goes wrong (though they can also cackle madly just a little).\\n\\n\nThe true draw of Higurashi is the mystery. The series will leave you guessing, postulating all manner of reasons why the sweetest girl in the class is now butchering every child in sight with a giant cleaver. Each experiment you run (arc you see) reveals a few more clues, and you formulate a new theory, only to find it shattered by another totally unexpected horror in the very same arc. The beauty of Higurashi is that a mystery of such grand scale, every detail is meticulous, and while every bloody event seems random at first, they all eventually fall into place\\n\\n\nNot only are the characters are memorable, and filled with interesting secrets, and unlike school days, they're actually also extreme likeable. This is no small achievement, given what they're portrayed doing to each other. \\n\\n\nHigurashi is really the pinnacle of a dark mystery. You'll start off the mad scientist, watching those innocents in the test chamber with morbid curiosity. Yet, slowly, that morbid curiosity will be transformed into sympathy, and as you fall in love these victims, that initial curiosity will into turn a genuine desire to figure out whats going on so that they can be saved.\\n\\n\n***\\n\\n\nAs always, I welcome feedback!\\n",

            "content": "Higurashi epitomizes how you should never judge something by its cover. At first glance, it looks like a simple, generic harem series or a lame, cliched romance. This anime, however, is nothing short of genius. The whole setting, atmosphere, and mood are incredibly well executed. The plot may seem simple at first, a new kid moving to a strange, new town and meeting new friends. Beneath the exterior appearance of this seemingly tame series, however, lies a dark story of murder, violence, and mystery.\r\nStory: I can confidently say that the story/plot is the strongest aspect of this series. I congratulate the original game designer whocreated this series. The execution of the plot is genius. This series mainly consists of arcs. Although these arcs seem disjointed at first, it is all part of the plot and is actually an important part of solving the mystery of the Hinamizawa murders. However, this is not a simple, generic murder mystery where the solutions are force fed to the viewers; it is up to them to decide between what is true and what is not. This way, it makes the viewers think and interact with the story, and this is what I love most about Higurashi.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: If there is one reason why I did not give this series a 10, then it is because of the art and animation. The art itself is not too bad, but the animation... How do I start? It can be extremely inconsistent at time with all those emo face contortions, sometimes out of sync, and was probably animated with a relatively low budget. Thank goodness the director of season 2 learned from those mistakes, and the animation greatly improved in Kai. One good thing I have to say is that the background and setting is very well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice acting in this series is amazing. With a series filled with psychotic laughter, blood-curling screams, and in some cases, extremely cute voices, the voice actors/actresses are extremely versatile. The Opening is one of my favorite openings of all time. It sets up the mood extremely well and sent shivers down my spine when I first saw it. There could not have been a better fitting opening. The ending, a slow rather mellow piece, suffers from horrible Engrish. I do love the piano part in the end though. Finally, the background music set the mood nicely, but can get repetitive at times. I did like the sounds of the cicadas; it gave a feeling of impending  doom.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: After the initial shock of their mental instability, the cast of characters are extremely well written and developed. Sure, none of the main cast of characters is emotionally and mentally stable; it does not take away from their personality and interaction. One of the best things about this series is that there is no throw away characters that only appear once, does something, and leaves. Every character serves a purpose in the mystery and plot, either directly and indirectly. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: As I have said earlier, I love how Higurashi is not a passive anime where I can just sit in front of the computer and shut off my brain. Then again, I love psychological anime. Higurashi was the first series that forced me to watch raws because I could not wait for the subs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall an excellent show. This would definitely be a 10 if not for its mediocre animation. Final rating: 9/10\\n",

            "content": "\u2013Spoilers\u2013\r\nHigurashi no naku koro ni happens to be a particular favourite of mine, not only because of its horrifically high gore content, but for the number of times it managed to catch me off guard. I found it hard to believe how someone could commit such stomach-churning acts of violence and mental torture. It\u2019s the original shock at this fact that compels the viewer to continue watching this highly addictive bloodbath of an anime.\r\nThe concept of the anime is simple enough. It follows a teenage boy, Maebara Keiichi adjusting to his new life in Hinamizawa, an isolated village buried deep in the mountains. It\u2019s notlong before he makes friends with a group of girls. At first glance they seem like the average group of teenage girls but all is not as it seems because they\u2019re actually hiding things from Keiichi, things like the mysterious string of murders that seem to occur the same night every year and the gruesome dismemberment of a dam construction worker. The more Keiichi learns about these past events and about his new \u2018friends\u2019 the more danger he begins to find himself in. \\n\\n\r\nIt is important to remember that Higurashi is divided into 6 separate arcs that feature completely different scenarios. This means that if a character were to meet their unfortunate demise in one arc they would return once again at the start of the next arc. It is this separation of the arcs that often confuses or deters people from watching the show. I too confused by the sudden, miraculous \u2018revival\u2019 of a few of the characters at first but the sooner you adjust to the ever-changing alternate storylines the sooner you can start to piece together the puzzle and work out why the murders are being carried out in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of this anime is nothing spectacular; in fact it seems pretty inappropriate for this particular genre of anime. The girls could very well have been plucked straight from a harem anime, but for some wacky reason that seems to work for this anime. The outward \u2018Lolita\u2019 appearances of the girls only make their actions more shocking in contrast; in a sense their design lulls you into a false sense of security. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike in other anime of this particular genre it is difficult not to find someone to like in Higurashi, which is highly unusual considering the sickening acts of torture these girls perform on each other and with those around them. As you begin to get to know the characters better, you begin to sympathise with them and hope that they too won\u2019t meet an untimely fate, thus you begin to feel more involved. Each character has their own interesting perspective and heart-breaking story to tell, it is this that alleviates the anime from being a bloodbath to a bloodbath with depth. \\n\\n\r\nBoth the Higurashi OP and EN themes are hauntingly beautiful and nigh on impossible to fault. Shimamiya Eiko does an amazing job at capturing the show\u2019s otherworldly aspect with her almost ethereal voice during the OP theme. The instrumental themes used throughout the show can both send chills down your spine or even cause you to laugh out loud given the right moment. I found that the show\u2019s use of chilling piano solos or mellow flute pieces helped to build tension and inspire fear within myself as a viewer, so by keeping the themes themselves simple they\u2019ve helped to accentuate the atmosphere of the show rather than outshine it completely.\\n\\n\r\nAs the viewer becomes more intertwined in both the storyline and with the characters their desire for the characters to be set free from the horrific chain of events grows stronger, it is this that hooks the viewer into watching episode after episode. So overall, for being able to manipulate its viewers emotions so well I\u2019d give this anime a near perfect score of 9/10.\\n",

            "content": "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni has received much praise from the anime community in general, which hails it as the mystery to end all mysteries. Everybody loves it and chances are that, if you're reading this now, you've heard good news!\r\nHowever, upon my completion of the anime and the 2 subsequent seasons that followed, I came to the conclusion that this praise was COMPLETELY undeserved by the anime, which is mediocre in the intellectual department, and is much less a mystery story than it is an action/adventure story with a lot of secrets. Furthermore, any actual \"mystery\" behind the story is made impossible to solveby the introduction of unnecessary paranormal elements and fictional diseases.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I was very disappointed by this anime, and it is not worth the hype.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nStory: The first part of the first season I found to be very interesting indeed. Everything was confined within the laws of physics, and I was constantly on my toes trying to solve the mystery of Hinamizawa. Sadly, the story floundered from the last arc of the first season up to halfway through the second season, and it became a chore to watch. The introduction of unnecessary paranormal elements and fictional diseases did not help either, and only served to further complicate the plot while not adding much value to the story. In any case, we certainly could have done without them. Luckily, the story picks back up during the second half of the second season, which greatly makes up for the absolute failure of a first half, and you'll probably find yourself pleased with the ending.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would say that the story lowered itself from what it could be (an awesome mystery story) to what it is now... a confusing action adventure story for people that like to pretend they know what's going on from the very first episode.\\n\\n\r\nScore - 6; Completely overrated. So much wasted potential...\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: I wouldn't say that the art is completely terrible, but it certainly could've been better. The artist uses gradeschool techniques of using unusual hair to differentiate the characters. Okay. The little girls are anorexic and have square-shaped heads. Alright. Mion and Shion have stereotypical oversized breasts. I'm losing my patience...\\n\\n\r\nThen I figured out that Teppei Houjou is a recolor of Ooishi.\\n\\n\r\nNow I'm just angry.\\n\\n\r\nThe blood and gore portrayed in the anime does help alleviate the pains of this travesty though, and the general art style isn't atrocious like in some other anime I know, so I can't give it a 0.\\n\\n\r\nScore - 3; Everything you would expect to see in an anime, with added blood. I don't see why everyone thinks it's so special.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: I found that the voice actors fit the characters well, and I was also impressed by the ending and opening themes for each series. However, I found some of the character dialogue cheesy, and some of the children's speech patterns were annoying (okay Satoko, you miss your brother, we get it.)\\n\\n\r\nScore - 7; The VA's were good, the soundtrack is nothing to scoff at, but the dialogue is not without its flaws.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: You know, I must admit that the character development was pretty &quot;good&quot;. In fact, it was so &quot;good&quot;, that I was bored by it. I found Rika's long tangents later in the series to be uninformative, uninteresting, and unimportant. But it's okay because &quot;it helps build her character!&quot; right? \\n\\n\r\nWrong! \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, I don't see why the hell the older characters would even bother to hang around with the younger ones, aside from Shion that is. And, more importantly, why the devil does someone like Satoko know guerrilla warfare!? Humorous as it may be, I don't believe it is ever explained.\\n\\n\r\n(and even if it is, that doesn't explain why she can knock Keiichi flat across the room without batting an eyelash!)\\n\\n\r\nScore - 4; I was sarcastic when I said that the character development was good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Despite being highly disappointed by the anime as a whole, the ending was cute and the beginning does get you hooked pretty quickly, so I did moderately enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nI think my favorite arc was when Keiichi threw the ohagi at the wall. I lol'd pretty hard.\\n\\n\r\nScore - 7; Maybe I'm being generous, but I had a few good laughs and there was nothing better than seeing the look on Keiichi's face when that ohagi went splat.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6; Although I was highly disappointed by it, the anime did have its good points. My advice to you is don't listen to the hype and don't bother with it unless you like shoddy, confusing storylines.",

            "content": "Horror. Blood, guts, gore, screams and its very dark tones. Something i am not a big fan of. But despite all that, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is simply astounding. Mind-bending, chaotic and filled with near-perfect execution.\r\nStory: The story focuses on the village of Hinamizawa, and it's hidden and very chilling secrets.  Keiichii Maebara has just moved to the countryside village, and is enjoying his new life with his new friends Rena Ryuugu, Mion Sonozaki, Rika Furude and Satoko Houjou. But underneath the peaceful times, is the chilling mysteries of the Hinamizawa Dam Construction murders, and the Watangashi festival. With this season split intothe 4 question arcs and the first two answer arcs, not everything is answered yet. But the crazy plot twists will keep you eager to watch the next episode, even if you see a gruesome scene or two.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: All the characters (Especially Rena and Rika) look very cute, and the backgrounds are all quite well animated. The art style is wonderful too. But unfortunately, their faces distort to X-stream when they're in psycho mode. These inconsistencies with the animation is sometimes an added plus when it comes to scaring you even more.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I'm addicted to the OP and ED. I adore the little touch at the end when they do the next episode preview while the piano plays at the end of the ED. The background music also fits in very well, and the voice acting is superb. How can they laugh so well? Must be practice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I enjoyed every character in at least one arc. I even liked Satoko and Shion in arcs 2 and 3. Though nothing can beat Rika's cute phrases and Rena's graceful style. They all develop through the story at a steady pace. Keichii's behavior changes quite a bit throughout the show too, but I believe that he will be a very strong character in Kai. His determination and his will to trust his friends will pull him through. Oishi and Irie was also great minor characters, but I'm unsure on which side they are really on, and their motives...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Simply put, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is the perfect anime for anyone that enjoys to really interact, predict and think with the storyline and it's characters. An unbelievable horror anime, and a decent comedy too. Hey, i liked the lame comedy scenes. This is Studio DEEN's masterpiece.",

            "content": "There is an alarming number of people in the online anime community who hail this series as one of the best series in not only the horror/suspense/mystery genre, but in all of anime itself. For the life of me, I cannot discern where people get these feelings from. Higurashi is one of the most over rated series I've ever watched.\r\n90% of the reason Higurashi is so terrible results directly due to the fact that the series is basically the same premise retold over and over again, a little different each time, in each 4-6 episode arc. It becomes a chore to watch it after yourealize it's going to start over and retell a similar story in the second arc. But it goes beyond that, once you realize it's not even the same story. It's an entirely new story that has little to do with what you just watched before it.\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi attempts to be a mystery, yet fails miserably. A mystery requires consistancy, something Higurashi lacks entirely. What happens in each arc is not the same as what happened in the arc before it. Imagine a story that retells itself again and again, each time showing you different perspectives of the same story, letting you in on different key knowledge that you may have lacked in the last arc, that you might come to understand and solve the mystery over time: This is what Higurashi SHOULD have been. But it's not. Each arc tells the story differently, to the degree that you are confused by what has actually happened and what events are relevant to what is currently going on. Things happen so differently that what is actually going on is indecipherable, leaving Higurashi little more than imagery of cute little girls turning psychotic in various situations that tell no complete story. Higurashi is utterly confusing and incomprehensible. The true mystery becomes, \"Why does this have nothing to do with what I watched in the last arc?\" not, \"Why are strange murders happening every year at the same time.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing propelling you to watch more of Higurashi is faith that it will eventually explain everythng to you. But it will not. Without giving any spoilers, Higurashi throws entirely new concepts at you at the end which bring about more questions than answers. At the end of the 26 episodes, one feels entirely cheated, as though an enormous amount of time has been wasted. One goes on web forums and complains of this, only to be told by fervent lolicons that, \"You have to watch the second series before judging it. It explains all.\" But one is left looking at another 20-something episode long series and feeling not very optimistic, ready to watch something worthwhile, something that is not Higurashi. I don't waste my time watching an entire season with very little redeemable about it to conclude that I need to watch the second season. I just cut my losses and move on.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't even likeable. There is a stupid male protagonist that is often referred to as bright even though he consistently does the stupidest things known to man (horror protagonist syndrome) and everyone else is a generic little girl. Oh, and there's a detective. In one arc he's a nice guy. In another he's a terrible douchebag. Again, no consistency.\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi will appeal to certain groups of people: Lolicons, people that like stuff just because it is weird and confusing, and people that like anything with blood and graphicness in it. Unless you fit that bill, I cannot comprehend what you would like about Higurashi. The only good thing I can say about it is that there are parts of it that are a bit creepy. But it's even a bad suspense story, as each time the suspense builds up, the story retells itself in a new arc and drops all the suspense.\\n\\n\r\nIgnore the hype. Unless you like little girls, pass on this one.",

            "content": "Higurashi is a really confusing, complex and difficult to explain anime. Some may view it as belonging to the horror or psychological genre; some may find it as a really weird harem series containing crazy, killer lolis; others may consider it a failure since it doesn't seem to belong to any of the afore-mentioned genres. Considering how much amount Higurashi incorporates, all views are understandable; this certainly isn't a series that's easy to comprehend by everyone. Higurashi is a mixture of mystery, blood, humor, romance and especially nice moral stories; but above all \u2013 Higurashi should be perceived as a really challenging logic problem.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, there are two approaches when watching Higurashi. You may choose to view it as any other anime: wait for the story to unfold, wait for the characters to develop, wait for the plot to advance. It isn't a wrong choice; this way, you may either like or dislike Higurashi; yet you will probably never get beyond the 'killer lolis', 'aww Rena is so adorable', 'okay, something is seriously wrong with this anime' stage. Yes, you might like, maybe even love it; but you will certainly NOT enjoy Higurashi to its full potential, for everything it has to offer. \\n\\n\r\nIf you choose the other road, however, you're in for a big torment. You will be annoyed, hurt, growling, and most of all, you will get headaches from the fake hints; to put it easier, you will be mindfucked. Higurashi manages to do something that very few series have succeeded in doing: involve the viewer by making him interact with everything that unfolds on the screen. \\n\\n\r\nHigurashi's main characteristic is that it's intelligently and elegantly indirect. You are shown almost opposite images of the same place, person or event and left to judge by yourself whether that's relevant or not, whether there's something hidden behind the apparent motives  and whether it's the correct portrayal of what's actually happening. What may be the correct deduction of a sequence of events at some point is completely overthrown later on; the theories you may have built in the very beginning, some more far-fetched than the others, all crumble as the story progresses. Because Higurashi is so brilliantly created, it actually presents a lot of fake hints, irrelevant tips and confusing matters; but that's all the more reason to enjoy it in the very end and re-watch it as many times as possible. \\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply, it's not wrong to view Higurashi as a math problem. You may wait for it to be solved by a teacher or someone in your class and understand it along the way. Or you may try to solve it yourself, by bumping upon walls and dead ends, reaching incorrect results and choosing the wrong parameters \u2013 but having a feeling of a much deeper satisfaction once you finish it. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi's story is its strongest point. The viewer is presented a series of 6 of the 8 main sound novel arcs, all beginning at approximately the same point, having certain common characteristics, but unfolding differently. If you are not a fan of 'what if?' scenarios, then this certainly isn't for you. However, if you do enjoy putting the pieces together and forming a puzzle (which lacks the very core\u2014the margins, only to be completed on season 2), then you will find this extremely  entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nChecking Higurashi's synopsis, you will see that there are question arcs and answer arcs. Do not be naive. Answer arcs might solve apparent issues, but they only bring up even more questions \u2013 related to the overall story. Don't watch Higurashi expecting to see that if 'a+b=c, then b=c-a'. Higurashi will simply say: 'a + something = c, I'll only give you bits and scraps hinting to what that certain something is, so use your brain to figure out the truth, 'cause I'm not gonna tell ya directly.' \\n\\n\r\nIf you are to take each of Higurashi's arcs separately, they all follow the same pattern. Each scenario begins with a peaceful, tranquil Hinamizawa in the summer light, only to end up in a diametrically opposed atmosphere. This might sound quite repetitive in the beginning, but do not forget that it's only a means of hiding the true face of this show. Also, don't make the mistake of thinking each arc can be seen individually; Higurashi does have an overall plot that links together the sectioned, secondary stories. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi's characters are all really refreshing, strong-determined and easy to recognize. Although their evolution throughout each arc might seem a bit inconsistent, they do develop from scenario to scenario, which only adds up to the enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nKeiichi:\\n\r\nKeiichi is a strong main male character. And he should be, considering what he has to face. It's not just unusual club activities or dealing with a lot of girls; Keiichi has to have the willpower to take what he sees as the (often regretful) right decision at the right time. Keiichi isn't a person to back up when it comes to challenges or teasing; if it's within his reach, he'll do anything to have the best possible outcome. \\n\\n\r\nRena:\\n\r\nRena is a character that might seem extremely likable in the very beginning, but her patterns of acting do tend to get a bit overused as the series progresses. Rena is a typical, nice, charming girl; however, remember that this is Higurashi, so nothing actually is as the first impression suggests. Rena has her dark sides too; quite a lot, in fact. She's one of the elements that give the series its most eerie moments. \\n\\n\r\nMion:\\n\r\nMion is the sanest of all the characters. She's pretty much a walking contrast between how she acts and how she feels. Mion is a game freak and a challenges and penalties lover; that, and the fact that she refers to herself as 'an old man', give off a tomboy aura. Despite this, Mion also has a lot of girly sides, which are mostly shown throughout the second and fifth arc, which center around her and her sister Shion.\\n\\n\r\nShion:\\n\r\nMost of the times, Shion is missing from the main, 5 club members group. However, she has an entire arc shown through her perspective. Shion's story is one of the most touching and well executed throughout the show; it clearly shows how easy it is for a person's completely logical and functional world to be thrown upside-down through a series of misunderstandings that pile up and make it crumble eventually. \\n\\n\r\nSatoko:\\n\r\nSatoko is quite a controversial character. Most of the time, she acts like an annoying brat that tries to show off \u2013 however, she also has a darker side of the story, materialized through the torments received from her (adoptive) parents and the disappearance of her brother Satoshi.   Satoko's arc might seem a bit repulsing in the beginning; however, it only gives her the right portrayal of her personality. \\n\\n\r\nRika:\\n\r\nI deliberately left Rika for the end; she's the only character that doesn't have her very own arc in the first season, and there's a good reason for that. As the first 6 scenarios suggest, there's something more that comes to Rika than her joyful 'Nii~pa' or her habit of patting the heads. \\n\\n\r\nART AND SOUND\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi's art is probably its only flaw. It certainly differs from the symmetrical, big-eyed, perfectly aligned bodies the viewer might be used to. This might seem like a turn-off in the beginning, but it actually manages to catch the unstable spirit of the anime quite well after a while. Despite this, there is a good part too: a big effort was put into backgrounds; they look realistic and flow nicely, deepening Hinamizawa's tranquility. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike the art, the sound of Higurashi is excellent. The actors did an extraordinary job managing to capture all voice fluctuations, especially the negative inducing ones. Shion's laughter is probably one of the creepiest things you'll find in an anime; Rena's 'Uso da!' will surely give you a chill down your spine; Keiichi's paranoid screams will make you paranoid as well. It's not easy portraying such a wide range of emotions, yet Higurashi doesn't fail. There's also the constant chirping of cicadas that can be heard in the background; hence the series' name. This often compensates the background music, which is only above average. OP theme is terrific, being one of the very first elements that might attract the viewer into watching the anime, since you'll just feel like listening to it countless times; still, ED might seem a bit unusual, since it's sung in (a pretty weird) English. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned before, Higurashi isn't a series for everyone. If you watch it expecting to be a horror, bloody show or just another harem, then you'll probably not like it. Higurashi's main function isn't to have horror, fanservice, tragic pasts or cute moments. Sure, it does contain its fair share of all of these; but Higurashi's purpose is to involve the viewer into a really intricate and entertaining mystery and make fun of him being fooled by fake pieces of information. If you do expect something different, however, you might just discover a hidden behind the curtain masterpiece \u2013 for Higurashi is certainly special and extremely enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nIn a world where a lot of anime series offer fans simple, almost nonexistent plots with clich\u00e9 and predictable characters, humor that's either brilliant or fail, tons of useless fanservice and many other simplicities just for the sake of existing, Higurashi certainly stands out \u2013 as being an intelligent series where a lot of effort was put into breaking the boundaries and giving the viewer an overall extremely satisfying impression and enjoyable (though often confusing) watch.",

            "content": "June 1983, a sleepy rural town in Japan. This is the auspicious setting of a tragedy that will befall a small group of classmates and their entire community. This is a tragedy that is destined to happen again, and again, and again. How and why is Hinamizawa doomed to this fate? What dark secrets does the town hold? This is a tale that seems simple on the surface but the use of character, perspective, and story-telling helps to make Higurashi one of the greatest anime ever made.\r\nThe very first episode of Higurashi can be off-putting, as it introduces a cast of characters that seem atthe time more like a collection of overused anime tropes from a slice-of-life anime than people the viewer would want to care about. Here's Keiichi, the stock new kid in town. Here's Rena, the stock girl-next-door girlfriend-type. Here's Mion, the stock tomboy. Here's Satoko, the brat. So on down the line. This is not the way people will view the characters by the end of the show, but it ends up being a smart choice to use character types that will be initially familiar to regular anime fans. The show is made much more disturbing and emotionally jarring by the juxtaposition between the light comedy parts that happen at the beginning of each story arc and the grim, violent results after events and character psyches degrade. The great contrast between the Azumanga-esque comedy bits, complete with super-deformed characters and great exaggerations, and the paranoia and psychotic murders, is one of the best artistic devices of the show. If these were dark characters more suited for a horror show, there would not have been the same emotional impact.\\n\\n\r\nStyle aside, Higurashi takes an interesting format in basically retelling the same story again and again, but changing key details and character perspectives each time to keep rehash almost nonexistent. During this first season especially, each retelling of the Hinamizawa tragedy reveals more truths behind the town, the background of the characters, and the surprisingly deep interpersonal relationships between them. Facts you learn towards the end of the season will give entirely new meaning to events you saw in the first part of the season. Each story arc peels away layers of the juicy  truth, which gives each story arc something that enhances the whole.\\n\\n\r\nEven putting aside the conclusions the viewer makes by putting the arcs together, each story arc is also its own rich self-contained story. Each time you start a new arc, the protagonist may be different. The killer may be different. The protagonist may be the victim or the killer. An arc usually focuses on one or two of the main characters and gives them their own story, subtly replacing the original image you had of them as a stock anime character with a new image of them as a fleshed-out character with a strong personality and motivations.\\n\\n\r\nWithout giving away any spoilers, the arc that begins with episode 16 is for me the highlight of Higurashi. It encapsulates everything one can love about the show. It creates great revelation about an earlier story arc. It has really intense and disturbing horror scenes (that are still tastefully done). It also is a great character study, showing how a seed of resentment and great trauma can push a normal person to the brink of madness.\\n\\n\r\nAfter having watched both seasons of Higurashi once before and knowing the entire truth, watching the show a second time still filled me with a range of emotions from laughter to sadness to horror to thoughtfulness to excitement, all delivered to great effect and in a refreshing way. If you are not a horror fan, it may be hard for you to get past some of the content, but at the same time most of the gore is just off-camera so that you can feel the disgust without it being gratuitous. For those with adult sensibilities, it is easy to fall in love with a show and a story as breathtaking and unforgettable as Higurashi no Naku Koro ni.",

            "content": "5 WORDS OR LESS REVIEW: Cute and Bloody\r\nOn the surface, Higurashi seems like a cute and moe anime that&rsquo;s chockfull of loli girls forming their own harem for the main character Keichi. It&rsquo;s not. Seriously, a small village separated from the rest of the world has &ldquo;murder&rdquo; written all over it.\r\nWho knew cutesy characters and blood would make a psychotic anime that&rsquo;s absolutely fun to watch? I&rsquo;ve always liked cute anime and violent anime but I never thought I&rsquo;d find one that incorporates both. Whoever made this into an anime knows me too well. It&rsquo;s even funny sometimes, and I love watching anime that makesme laugh. It also makes me think and come up with conclusions, another aspect I like about it. Combining all four elements I mentioned is no easy feat, and yet this anime was able to accomplish it.\\n\\n\r\nI like how the characters have split personalities. For the first episodes of each arc, they&rsquo;re all happy, cheerful and cute, then all of a sudden, they become psychos. That&rsquo;s when I think &ldquo;So this is when the real fun starts&rdquo;. My favorite character would have to be Rika Furude. She&rsquo;s so cute and innocent looking, but you can&rsquo;t help wonder if that&rsquo;s just a fa&ccedil;ade. I&rsquo;m still confused about her. She and the other girls are sort of like angels with dirty faces (or plain old schizos).\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as for the voice actors, seiyu Mai Nakahara will have to be my favorite. In the series I&rsquo;ve watched, she always played the upbeat and cheerful girl, but by playing Rena you get to hear her voice in a different way. I love how the girls&rsquo; voices change from happy to psychotic in a heartbeat.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is sort of a mixed bag. As a whole, everything looks great, specially the backgrounds. However, the character designs need some work. It&rsquo;s just too inconsistent, and there are times when the characters end up looking deformed and pretzel-like. I like the choice of color though &ndash; it&rsquo;s a fine mix of pastel hues and vibrant colors.\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM was good, but the sound effects were even better. The sound effects were very convincing, and it heightens the tension and feel of those especially violent scenes. Hearing the sound of bodies being mutilated was enough to send chills down my spine. I liked the OP very much, I have heard nothing like it before, but I like the Engrish ED too. It&rsquo;s mellow but creepy.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn&rsquo;t really a spoiler, but more of an explanation on how the storyline operates. Basically, Higurashi is divided into arcs, the longest arc had 6 episodes and the shortest had 2 episodes. In the first season, there are 4 question arcs, which pose a situation that&rsquo;s left unsolved, and there are 2 answer arcs (the other 2 will be featured in the second season), which will explain the question arcs. The 4 question and answer arcs are distinct from each other, with some constants (Rika is still the Miko, Keichi is still a transfer student, etc). I think they made the series that way because that was how the video game was.\\n\\n\r\nIf you&rsquo;re not into anime that will potentially have you scratching your head, then this isn&rsquo;t for you, but I urge everyone who reads this review to give Higurashi a try, because in all honesty it is one of the best series I&rsquo;ve seen in my life.",

            "content": "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is a Psychological, Horror, Mystery anime unlike any other, as it is easy to get hooked on it. The story is incredible because it does something I haven&rsquo;t seen before, by splitting the series into various arcs, each telling a different story. Each of these arcs are somewhat linked with each other, as they provide the viewer with different questions and try to give an answer. What&rsquo;s more interesting is how each story slowly builds up to its climax. I found it amazing how each retelling gave me a different feel and how a lot of things were finally piecedtogether. The only problem is that it can be very confusing for people watching this show for the first time, but this just promotes its re-watch value.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters for this anime are what deceive you, into a false sense of security, as someone who may not much about it will think of this as a harem (1 guy + cute girls). However these mysterious characters help bring genuine fear, to those who watch this, as you just don&rsquo;t know what to expect when you add mental instability to the mix.  \\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that lets this anime down was the animation, as it is incredibly inconsistent. There was very little detail put into the character designs but worse was the disfigured faces as a means of portraying insanity. Nonetheless the animation was pretty fluid and the characters facial expressions were fairly frightening, to suit this creepy anime. The music does a great job in setting the right moods, with creepy melodies to go with eerie tone and sinister music when someone&rsquo;s being bludgeoned to death.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it&rsquo;s hard to find a series that that portrays a murder mystery as well as this one; as it perfectly executes suspense, climax and shocking moments to make it exciting to watch. It was quite troubling that it left a lot of questions unanswered, but that is what the 2nd season is for. The real problem was how poorly executed the ending was, as it didn&rsquo;t make the slightest bit of sense. Taking that into account, the overall feeling got from watching this anime isn&rsquo;t lost. So I recommend Higurashi no Naku Koro ni to any anime fan, who can handle a bit of mind torture.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "I never showed any interest towards this anime but a lot of people seemed to like it because of its unique approach. So I thought, why not give this a try? To be honest, I still don't know what to think about Higurashi... \r\nLet me start by saying this anime is divided in arcs counting 4 to 6 episodes each approx. Each arc tells a different story (though I'm not sure they really were different) and the last two arcs seem to explain the events in the previous arcs. I didn't like this idea but why not give it a try? Well, my main reasonwhy -not- to watch this again is because the first 3 to 4 arcs are practically the same and bored me for about 13 episodes. I only enjoyed the horror moments which unfortunately were few. After the first half the arcs did get better and the explanatory arcs were nice, but this isn't all that bothered me about Higurashi. \\n\\n\r\nHow on earth did the producers come up with such annoying characters?! I'm not the kind of person to be easily annoyed by characters but boy! Never have I seen such unsteady characters. Even the ever expanding chaotic universe is more steady then Keiichi and his friends. I also couldn't stand the voice actors, they didn't sound believable at any point throughout the series. The animation didn't exactly help out here. Scenery and backgrounds were nicely done but I didn't enjoy the character designs. The facial expressions didn't impress me a lot either, except for when the characters got angry. They did a good job there.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say I liked the development of the story since the first few arcs are truly retellings of similar stories. I still don't know what happened and what didn't, but the final two arcs were a big improvement so I am interested in watching the second season: Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai. The comedy throughout the story wasn't exactly my cup of thee either. The place the story takes place in and the side elements, however, do speak to the viewers imagination. A little town where people desperately believe in their god who happens to enjoy torturing people,.. it's the perfect settlement for a psychological horror anime.\\n\\n\r\nConcerning the soundtrack, I didn't like the opening nor the ending song. Again a bummer. Also its animation wasn't what it could or should have been. I only remember the cicadas crying from the first till the last episode, so there's little to talk about the music. \\n\\n\r\nHigurashi didn't disappoint me since I didn't expect a lot from it, however I will watch the second season hoping for a reasonable amount of horror and some decent storytelling. If only the characters would have been better developed I would have enjoyed this a lot more, but a bunch of insecure children trying to act tough just don't get to me. Funny enough the supporting characters were more convincing and are probably what kept me watching.",

            "content": "Although i do not usually find myself watching much anime of this kind, with it's violence and gore, Higurashi  no Naku Koro ni (as well as the subsequent second season) has had me hooked from the very beginning.\r\nSo, where do i begin? Right from the very first the story has you thrown, the opening few sequences quell your thirst as you watch the first of many entangled mysteries, involving the initial main character  Keiichi Maebara play out a horrific opening few minutes.\r\nAll of the main characters remain likeable, this despite the stories and events that unfold. Unlike much other anime, where the storyunravels gently as the episodes flow, Higurashi cleverly (and at times annoyingly) allows you to observe whats is essentially the same story many times over, each time with differing events and consequences. These seem at first unrelated however as the series goes on we find the stories cleverly intertwining themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself in the first series is composed mainly of the 4 question arcs, each of which takes the viewer down the same path and ultimately the same end, each time a different character becomes embroiled in tragedy, with a big climax ensuing as each arc ends. There are also the first 2 answer arcs, which allow the viewer to see some of the reasons behind the stories and events, but never revealing enough for complete understanding.\\n\\n\r\nHow is the music you ask? The musical accompaniment is excellent and captures the emotions of all the key points throughout the series, as i write this i am in fact listening to Higurashi soundtrack music. The opening intro (name same as series itself) becomes very quickly catchy, and whilst the end theme 'Why, or why not?' is not my cup of tea, it is a very appropriate song.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one 'flaw' in the series it is some of the background art, which seems a little bit under detailed at times, however this never has or never will spoil my vast enjoyment of this series (and indeed of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai, the second season). The ending episode is also a masterpiece of storytelling, yet it still withholds much of the answers from it's viewers, leaving you wanting yet more. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the series is excellent and well worth a watch, even if the excess violence isn't your cup of tea it is used very well to tie in with the storylines, not just senselessly thrown in for effect.\\n\\n\r\nNot quite my favorite anime (Ranma 1/2 will forever have my heart on that one) but certainly my favorite watch this summer, highly recommended.\\n\\n\r\nSephSora\\n\\n",

            "content": "So yes this is a nice harem Anime, oh wait, this is supposed to be a horror? You sure could have fooled me. In terms of horror and suspense Higurashi is a complete and utter failure. Elfen Lied has nothing to fear now, it still probably can top this. Okay seriously I am very disappointed in this series, considering I wanted a good suspense thriller that wasn't based purely on 100% excess and shock-factoring like Elfen Lied.\r\nHigurashi is a story of several different arcs. Each arc is a different version of the same story. In 1983 a young male transfer student comes to a smalltown. A town with a deadly secret. Apparently after a traditional summer festival one person will be killed and another will disappear. The story repeats in the same fashion through each arc usually ending in a brutal murder or murders of some one or some people, but something.\\n\\n\r\nAs wonderful as the plot sounds it really isn't. The series had immense potential to create a suspenseful masterpiece, but instead it's like watching a toss away filler arc, that repeats its self until something finally happens after 6 episodes. Each episode is as long winded and wordy as the next. Oh but don't get me wrong, eventually something does happen, but when it FINALLY does it provides maybe a few minutes of fright but that's it, and when it finally does it's a very clich&eacute;d horror blunder trick comprised of a very cheesy sound effect that sounds like they are crushing tomatoes, and a cheesy cut out that either goes red or black.  \\n\\n\r\nThis series seriously lacks suspense, half the time you feel more like you are watching a slice-of-life comedy instead of a thriller. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then the story continues again and starts out the same, we're in the school house, they act like we don't know any of the character by now, and then some annoying detective shows up again to go over the SAME mystery we heard 5 episodes ago!  How many times do I have to be told the little girl's parents were ran out of the village because of a damming project and that the brother's bat has gone missing.   I feel like I'm watching Pokemon, with the same thing different day style it's done over the last 10 years.  \\n\\n\r\nThe series can work up it's suspense and chill level especially with the chirping cicadas that provide an almost melodic atmosphere, but fails to keep it long enough for us to get remotely interested. The whole time you are just questioning should I fast-forward or not?  Even when in my jumping through episodes and reading further spoilers, I find the series doesn't go anywhere else, it's a bad version of Ground Hog Day with out the comedy, and the Blair Which Project, with out the suspense. \\n\\n\r\nSure I like a talky as much as the next guy maybe even more than the next guy, but excessive dialog simply doesn't usually work well in a thriller.  The only time I have seen it work, was Madlax. The series tries to build and build but the suspense just keeps falling down again.  \\n\\n\r\nBut there are a few eerie moments, (key word being few) such as the wonderful psychotic laughter from the tiny little ones. (see: http://tinyurl.com/2w5tll) and when it finally does get to the horrifying climax it can give you a few chills, before it abruptly cuts off. Other than that, the series heavily relies on it's dialog and music to give any sense of a creepy atmosphere. And that is all it has going for it.\\n\\n\r\nI can't express how dull of a horror this really was. Die hard horror lovers may want to stick to Elfen Lied, as for the general suspense lovers (Like me) who want suspense and less gore, you may want to avoid this one. \\n\\n\r\nApparently when cicadas cry, this horror dies.  The only thing decent about this show was the  opening theme.  The sound effects sound cheesy and really childish.  Higurashi is basically a suspenseful melodrama with out the suspense.",

It\\'s a story about a group of kids, and the evil secrets that lies underneath the surface of their small town. Every year during a festival a mysterious  murder accurs. at the same time someone else goes missing without a trace.  \r\nThis story is actually made of several completely seperate but loosely related story arcs. At the begining of each things are almost exactly the same each time. They all start right before the festival begins and follows through the mysterious killings and to the conclusion of what acctually happened. Andit\\'s always the same person who gets killed and the same person who goes missing. The diffences come in the hows and whys (Kind of like the end of the movie \\'Clue\\' &quot;This is how it could have happened...&quot;) . The past events and explainations for the deaths are completely different everytime. And in the end you are left wondering what really happened.\\n\\n\r\nIt\\'s a pyschological thriller, and overall a very twisted anime. It will have you shaking your head  asking yourself, &quot;What the.....?&quot; and running in fear of any girl under the age of ten.  So needless to say I highly recommend it.\\n",

            "content": "First off, a word of advice.  Do not judge this show by the first episode. \r\nIt starts off like your standard anime with several lighthearted moments all the way through the first episode.  However, you&rsquo;d be a fool to think that this is all there is to it. This is not that type of show.  Higurashi masterfully combines physiological, mystery, horror and comedy in a way that is simply remarkable.  The anime is mind breaking and murderously genius.  It is so brilliant and unique that it&rsquo;s almost criminal to not give it the credit it deserves.\r\nIt takes physiological and horrorto a different level, it makes you feel secured using lighthearted moments to give the audience a feeling of false security.  The next thing you know, you might be looking right at death and despair.  Trust me, it will happen.  \\n\\n\r\nThe main five characters are Keiichi, Rena, Mion, Satoko and Rika. They all play important roles in the series and their actions throughout each chapter decide the outcome of the Arc (good or bad ending).  They all seem to lead carefree lives in Hinamizawa but in reality, they all possess a much darker and sadder history behind them than they appear to have.  Throughout the series, they somehow get involved several times with Oyashiro-sama&rsquo;s curse (the local God) and unfortunate chain of events are triggered every time.  \\n\\n\r\nThe anime/manga is divided into &ldquo;Arcs&rdquo; or Chapters (-hen).  The first part of the anime are the &ldquo;Question Arcs&rdquo;, showing us the mysterious deaths, Oyashiro-sama&rsquo;s curse, and the mystery behind the bizarre town of Hinamizawa.  The second part, &ldquo;Answer Arcs&rdquo;, provides us with answers to several events that happen in the first part.  The events in the following arcs may seem similar but the way in which they unfold and the events are quite different than the past arcs.  Additionally, throughout the series there are plenty of clues, speculations and theories that are hinted to help you solve the mysteries behind the town.  It is imperative to pay great attention to them and you&rsquo;ll see that the mystery behind the town of Hinamizawa slowly unwraps. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the music in Higurashi (Kai) perfectly fits the anime. The opening song &ldquo;When they Cry&rdquo; flawlessly portrays the dark, raging, and murderous feeling of the anime while contrasting it with scenes of serenity, sorrow and uncertainty.  Similarly, the ending theme &ldquo;Why or why Not?&rdquo; and the other OST songs are calm and pleasant to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro Ni is a show that should not missed, nonetheless, it is not a show for the overly sensitive, feint hearted, and simple minded due to the bloody scenes and complexity of the show itself.  If you are not into physiological-mystery or cannot handle graphic scenes you will not enjoy to the fullest and you will fail to appreciate it.   If you are looking for an incredibly unique, very complex and extremely engaging show, this anime is right for you.\\n",

            "content": "The first reason I came across Higurashi no Naku Koro ni was in an animation icon in which I saw a very graphic and disturbing scene and even though it was only about 8 seconds long, it was enough to have me hooked and this was because of what I could see - something insane happened, someone else was there, they were shocked, but then they looked liked they laughed insanely, probably out of fear and being psychotic, I presumed, but I had no idea what it was! I looked for a bit, but did not find it and about two weeks ago I finallydid come across it, found the name and began watching and I will say that within the first 20 seconds I was hooked.\\n\\n\r\nI do have a rather disturbing view on animes such as this, as well as others that are mature, violent and have tragic, jealous love stories - they are my favorites if done correctly and this one is done amazingly and that is only one part of what I love. There are an assortment of murders, but you are never sure what to believe or what to think, nor what is good and what is wrong and they are all done for the best reasons - the reasons that I look for in anime, books, movies and anything else because they are the true human emotions - love, jealousy, family, fear, protectiveness of those that you love, abuse, sibling love, first love, first crushes and everything else that makes a person what they are. Things that would be precious memories are nothing more than a myriad of blurs and confusion in which the main character sometimes does not know what is real and neither does the viewer. If you can top a psychological thriller with supernatural elements, then I am in my glory and this anime does just that.\\n\\n\r\nAforementioned, the first moments of the anime immediately will let you know if you can stand this kind of anime or not - a lot of is done like the beginning, which you see a rather vague vision of a guy beating something on the ground most likely to death with what looks like a bat, but you have no idea why, obviously and you do not see the actual beating, it is left to the imagination and much of the anime is like this and if you have an active imagination like me, filled with theories, then this anime is perfect for you!\\n\\n\r\nOnce the shocking beginning is over, if you are still watching and did not get disturbed and turn away from your screen, you are put into the normal setting for an anime - or so you think. You see a bunch of beautiful girls that look very different and act very different, as well, and the main character guy that was just doing the beating in the beginning, and they are all in school having a dandy time.\\n\\n\r\nBy now, you already know that this is not a happy, simple anime, so nothing obviously is what it seems and your mind immediately starts racing as to what just happened and if the violence started so soon, when could the next thing happen and it could literally happen at any moment!\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters live in a tiny little village away from main cities and civilization and they only have about 2,000 people in the entire town. The school where the main characters go is nothing more than one classroom which houses all the students in the town, from grade-school to high school, all in one classroom and there are only 15 students altogether, so once you learn this, you are creeped out even more because this is a very unique and disturbing setting. The town is in the middle of a beautiful, huge forest and the whole area is very majestic and isolated.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline of this anime is so intricate and woven that it really is hard to explain in words and I sat for a while before even trying to write this. You will want to watch the scenes again to make sure you didn't miss anything and so many things will rush through your head when you watch this anime because so many things happen unexpectedly and you have no idea why. \\n\\n\r\nContrary to what I thought, there isn't really an awful lot of actual violence on screen and the first animation I saw was one of the worst ones in the anime. However! There are a ton of different horrific things that happen, but you only get to see the beginning of them for most of the anime and your mind is left to figure out everything else, but really is hard to do!\\n\\n\r\nFor me, once again, this anime was perfect. I love watching things where you have to think and have theories and it makes your mind work, and this anime does just that. I was constantly trying to figure out what was happening and who was really who and even though I was right a lot of the time, when I was right, it was just totally more disturbing because the things I thought were very creepy.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a psychological supernatural thriller. There are very horrible things that happen very often, but you, the viewer are left to figure out what is real and what is not and who is really in the wrong and in the right. The first season of the anime covers four question arcs and two answer arcs, where the second season will hopefully finish the rest up.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors... oh, the voice actors were possibly among the best I have ever heard and they were totally satisfying for reach situation. Sometimes someone screams in a situation or laughs insanely, but they are not good at it - that is not the case in Higurashi. All the voice actors are extremely talented at their roles and most of them will actually give you chills at one point or another.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the art! The facial expressions and the different ways the characters eyes would change were absolute genius and I loved how the screen would slowly go over to their faces, so that you, the viewer, would have to wonder what their expression would be - would the character be sane at the moment, or would they be out of their mind? They also did not only have one expression for when people were upset and mad and insane, there were many different expressions for the different characters - they all have their own personal insanities!\\n\\n\r\nThe music is absolutely awesome for the anime. I got two of the soundtracks afterwards and have been listening to them non-stop. The music goes perfectly with the anime and sometimes it's happy, but generally it's creepy, psychotic, mysterious and makes you very nervous and scared, but it's also beautifully done. The opening theme will capture you and drag you in and you will have it stuck in your head non-stop and trust me, that is a good thing because it is awesome!\\n\\n\r\nI highly suggest this anime to anyone that liked animes such as Elfen Lied, which is another of my favorites. This anime is now among my favorites and I highly await watching the sequel, which I have not started yet and I am so happy to have come across this anime, I will admit... I LOVE THIS ANIME!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nTime to mix things up and review something good for a change. Today I will be reviewing Higurashi no naku koro ni/Kai. Do your best crazed evil laugh and read on if you dare!\r\nWARNING: Mild spoilers! Nothing major, but it is difficult to talk about the story or characters without saying something. If you haven't seen Higurashi and want to go in to it knowing absolutely nothing, please skip this review!\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe story takes place in the small, rural town of Hinamizawa. The story takes place in the 1980s, but Hinamizawa looks like its stuck in the 1950s or earlier. This is no ordinary smalltown though, because great evil is afoot and supernatural forces are at play. Plans for an American film adaptation quickly fell through, but I'm sure the American version would inevitably take place in the state of Maine. The first episode begins with Keichi (the bear Jew) Meibara brutally beating his classmates to death with a baseball bat. After the scene fades to black, we find everyone is alive again and it is as if none of it ever happened. Welcome to the madness of Higurashi! For little Rika Furude, a shinto priestess of the tiny village, death is never the end. Every time she dies, she wakes up a month or so earlier and must relive the same month before being killed again. Each alternate timeline has small differences that often ultimately result in large differences. Rika is like Bill Murray's Character in Groundhog's day, only instead of having to become a good person, she must find out who keeps killing her (the one thing she isn't allowed to remember) and protect her village from an unspeakably evil bioweapons expert who is essentially the lovechild of Shiro Ishii and Josef Mengele. I won't give away any more of the plot, since mystery is a large part of this series. I will say that this is a bizarre plot that takes the viewer on a wild ride you are unlikely to forget.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is Rika Furude, who appears to be the most adorable little girl in existence, but in reality is extremely depressed from her Sisyphean quest the Gods have given her. She has failed and died hundreds of times when we first see her, which is why there is something a little...off about her. She copes with her fate by being a complete wino. As an amusing sidenote, her favorite wine is Bernkastel, which is a white wine, yet in the anime it is always shown as a red wine. Other characters include the bossy,  self acclaimed leader Mion, Adorable Rena, mischievous Satoko, sometimes crazy Shion, and resident average straight man (comedy term, not talking about sexuality) Keichii. We also have some other quirky characters like the always creepy and possibly pedophilic Dr. Irie, and complete BADASS cop Akasaka. Obviously I'm not going to mention who the villain is, only that he/she is one EVIL motherfucker.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is often creepy, haunting, and plays up the tension of the mood. This is often a grim series, so you would expect a pretty dark sound track. There are also very silly scenes, and the soundtrack does a good job of capturing them as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art from the visual novels is legendarily bad. The art in the anime is actually pretty good. It isn't the greatest I have ever seen, but it is very solid.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is a series that will make you cringe in horror, cheer with excitement, laugh, question, shiver, and maybe even tear up a bit. It is the total package and over the course of 50 episodes is an epic roller coaster you don't want to miss.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDo you like horror? Psychological drama? Mystery? Higurashi is the series for you! This combines many genre's together with elegance and grace. Some people know of this series only as, \"that series with crazy laughs and bloody murders\", but it is SO much more than that. I would highly recommend watching it. Although you may have difficulty buying it on DVD in the US. At 200$ for 50 episodes, it is one of the most expensive series to own in all of existence! I know exactly 1 person that actually owns this series!\\n\\n",

            "content": "What the fuck did I just watch? I don't know , so I decided to make a review about it.\r\nThis show contains scenes of graphic lolita violence , as well as numerous murders commit by green haired girls. If your hearth is weak or you dislike seeing a river of blood coming out of a person's neck , you might want to stop reading and head to over to watch Kyoro-chan.\r\nOk , now all the girls and sissy men have left , let's take our magical briefs and jump right into the bloody mess of confusion called Higurashi.\r\nThe anime contains all the required otaku elementsfor the creation  of harem oxide. The elements in question are : twin sister , a compound of two lolis , a moe neutron (she always uses the phrase \"I wanna take it home\" , which implies she wants to form a covalent bond with a certain chemical) and a gay carbon atom.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime also introduces the concept of different dimensions which means love shapes such as love triangles and rectangles can turn into love cubes and triangular prisms.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is made of reusing  the same goddamn concept without explaining jackshit , each alliteration of the crimes is basically a spin-off show of the other - one of the characters goes loko and kills everyone.Hooray!\\n\r\nThe story is divided into 3 parts : the question arcs ( also knows as the 'WTF arc') , the answer arcs (also known as 'MINDFUCK arc\") and the filler arcs (also known as the 'actual plot').\\n\\n\r\nAfter finding out that K wasn't the main character I couldn't help but feel that the whole anime was designed for the single purpose of trolling the viewers. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime takes place in a village called Hinamizawa , which is situated in the upper middle equatorial subhemisphere of the pacific indian ocean. The village lacks any technology , which makes the villagers very frustrated as they are unable to fulfill their anime-related desires. When such an otaku is deprived of moe for too long he starts to develop what is called the Hinamizawa syndrome. It's basically like having suicidal intent but instead of having a clean death by hanging yourself , they use their nails to chop of their own necks. Lovely. The moral? Never take anime away from an otaku - he is going to break your kneecaps and then rip your hearth out to show it to you. Then proceed to shove it down your throat just to steal it AGAIN.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLike most viewers , I was very pleased to see some characters die. \\n\\n\r\n......\\n\\n\r\nHowever.\\n\\n\r\n......\\n\\n\r\nTHEY JUST WON'T STAY DEAD.     DIE BITCHES- DIE. \\n\\n\r\nI mean seriously , in MY anime , people DIE WHEN THEY ARE KILLED.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNot this anime , oh no. Logic won't work here , the only way to understand the work of a troll is to become one! \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are BUTTS. \\n\r\nBadass\\n\r\nUltimate\\n\r\nTranquil\\n\r\nTerminators\\n\r\nSalami!\\n\\n\r\nSo here they are in all their glory:\\n\\n\r\nMaebara 'K' Keichii - A man must have big balls to go through a populated village in a maid suit. When you start the anime you might think : \" Oh this guy looks like a complete loser - surely he must be the main character. And oh look is that Harem member #1? \" But no , fuck you Ryukishi07 , misleading us like that.\\n\\n\r\nSonozaki Shion and Mion - They trolled us by [huge fucking spoiler ahead] ....... having green hair. Also they are very similar in appearance - I just can't seem to figure out why. Uncle Mion is just there for no good reason , all she does is stay behind K and use her green hair to blend in with the trees around her.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRyuugu Rena - Why does the writer think it was a good idea to make a moe character stronger than Aizen? I mean she could K.O John Cena using her pinky . Not only that but she is also a kleptomaniac  ( aka she steals everything she finds cute - like the dead remains of zombie or a deathly hallow laying in a far away forest) and further more she often implies that she wants to kidnap children ( pedophilia) and take home K's manhood ( I am not even sure how to categorize this .... reverse rape? ).\\n\\n\r\nHojou Satako - A bunch of fucking traps made by this kid destroyed a whole professional military squad. Does this mean the Hinamizawa Branch School 's After School Games Club could effectively declare war to Japan and eventually conquer the whole fucking planet? \\n\\n\r\nRika Furude - She is a completely unimportant character - she has no relevant role in the story , she is not the actual main character and I guarantee she is not a person capable of traveling through different dimensions in any way. Seriously - that would be the mindfuck of the century - a loli for a main character and more so a WOMAN? Blasphemy!\\n\\n\r\nTomitake Jirou - He comes , takes a few pictures and then drops dead.\\n\\n\r\nTakano Miyo - She always dies in a fire probably.....\\n\\n\r\nAkasaka - Not wearing a shirt while piloting robots and wearing sunglasses that make you look like a fucking retard doesn't make you manly. Kicking ass at a vital point in the plot by nonchalantly rescuing the main character tends to have that effect.\\n\\n\r\nOoishi - 20 years of full time donut eating career made him wider than standard door width. His speed exponentially increases when he rolls on his stomach rather then using his tiny legs. Has a detective tie so I guess he is a detective.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo those are all the characters that are worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nLike all of Ryukishi07's works , the name of the anime involves crying - I guarantee that you will cry tears of happiness when Rika takes a chair and proceeds to beat the living crap out of Satoko.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is actually an animation of the visual novel made by the most trollastic company in the industry - 07 Expansion ( no relation with 07 ghost or 007) - and all I can say is thanks god they didn't copy the ENOURMOS hands the characters have because that would make the anime to easy to figure out - the Hinamizawa syndrome makes your hands bigger so you can more efficiently claw your throat.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime will most likely leave you scarred for the rest of your life. You are going to constantly check your food for needles , mistake markers for syringes and randomly make references:\\n\\n\r\nTeacher : \"There are only 8 planets in the solar system - Pluto  is not  a real pla--\"\\n\r\nYou : USODAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about Watanagashi . What the fuck is Watanagashi?  \\n\r\nIt's a festival where those dumbwits throw their junk into the river which is why there is no sweetfish in the river (get this reference and I will personally email you a napkin) - they basically take their old fridges and old corpses from the basement and throw them in the river . This is done as to purify themselves - even tho I fail to see how throwing garbage is an excuse for being a duchebag. If I was the king of Hinamizawa I would most certainly construct the most unethical harem ever created and the Watanagashi would basically be a huge paintball game - only instead of paint - we use actual m47 shotguns - HOORAY!\\n\\n\r\nBut enough about blowing heads off , tell me , do you regulary cut your nails? No? Then what are you waiting for? Come Hinamizawa's Nail Remover Shop - it's as easy as putting your hand in an apparatus which strips your nails in the most painful way possible! If you call now , we will remove not 3 , not 4 , but 5 NAILS AT THE PRICE OF ONE! If you make a reservation we will even take a picture of your agonized face that you can share with your friends! Nail Remover (tm) is fun for the whole family! Don't stand there like an idiot - call now! \\n\r\nThis review was broght to you by Sonozaki Tortures (R).\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure we all enjoy a good torture , especially after a bath in boling water , but we must think about less fortunate people , who don't have the resources to get a quality torture. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere are three anime arcs:\\n\\n\r\n1. No Naku Koro Ni (\"McDonalds Arc\")\\n\r\nOnikakushi-hen ( \"Milkshake Drinking Chapter\")\\n\r\nWatanagashi-hen (\"Fried Fish Chapter\")\\n\r\nTatarigoroshi-hen (\"McChicken Eating Chapter\")\\n\r\nHimatsubushi-hen (\"Mascot Killing Chapter\")\\n\\n\r\n2.Kai (\"Filler Arc\")\\n\r\nMeakashi-hen (\"Celestial Squirrel Chapter\")\\n\r\nTsumihoroboshi-hen (\"Octopus Riding Chapter\")\\n\r\nMinagoroshi-hen (\"Reverse Harem Chapter\")\\n\r\nMatsuribayashi-hen (\"Haruhi Worshipping Chapter\")\\n\\n\r\n3. Rei (\"Pockemon Arc\")\\n\r\nSaikoroshi-hen (\"Pikachu Choosing Chapter\")\\n\r\nBatsukoishi-hen (\"Charizard Choosing Chapter\")\\n\r\nHirukowashi-hen (\"Bulbasaur Choosing Chapter\")\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe moral of the story is not to give up hope just because it's hopeless and punch fate in the face. However we all know , hard work is overrated - I'd much rather sit on my ass all day.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is forced to repeat her life all over again , never being able to get past June  , now - I don't know what the fuck she is complaining about - just imagine the POSSIBILITIES. You could eat all you want , be over 150kg and then BOOM , back to being a fucking sack of bones  - you could kill the president of 4kids all over again and watch every single anime ever created. You don't have to study because you've already done your homework a few hundred times and so you eating icecream while watching a Haruhi Suzumiya special for ALL ETERNITY. No pain , no side effects . Although if you are actually inside a game controlled by witches you might get your ass handed but that would be just silly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe school those guys are attending to is just ridiculous , it's basically a hut with only one class , one teacher and one chair (which can be used as a weapon). The whole building is surrounded by vegetation where wolfs often look for preys. That's why leaving and going to school is often regarded as a struggle for your life.\\n\\n\r\nOyashiro-sama (Pi-mp-G-o-d) is the deity of the village , like all loving gods he often kills people that are sexier then her (all tho I'm not sure why Tomitake was killed). tHE name of this demonic creature is Hanyuu - her favorite food is cream puffs and tofu and she doesn't like spicy foods. But don't be fooled - she will smugger you with a pillow in your sleep.\\n\\n\r\nMaids were supposed to be a major plot device in this anime , sadly Keiichi is the only one. Just imagine his parents surprise when he gets home late in a maid suit  , they must've been speechless.\\n\\n\r\nKeichi     : I'm hoooome!\\n\r\nMother : \"Welcome home , swee-........ah......um , dear come here a second....\"\\n\r\nFather  : \"Is it that son of mine again? Has he----....\"\\n\r\nKeichi    : \" Problem , father?\"\\n\r\nFather :\"I am disapoint , son ---------you would look much better in a nurse suit\"\\n\r\nKeichi :\"Huh???\"\\n\r\nMother :\" He looks just like you when you were younger , dear. Guess the transvestite genes run in your family.\"\\n\r\nKeichi :\" THE FUCK?\"\\n\r\nFather :\"Dunno , I looked much more moe - remember when I confessed to you while wearing a bikini?\"\\n\r\nMother : \" How could I forget , you did it in front of the whole school\"\\n\r\nKeichi: \"Father , Mother , this is a misunderstanding , it's a punishment ga-\"\\n\r\nFather :\" Son.\"\\n\r\nKeichi :\"W-what is it?\"\\n\r\nFather :\" You have been trolled :))))\"\\n\r\nKeichi : FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd thus we have come to a conclusion in our journey to understand this zombie pile of flying bee-weasels . I am pretty sure reading this review will serve you well during the Armageddon as you will need plenty of chairs to bring down the army of human eating time vampires ( you know , like those from twilight and other failed books).\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI lift my arm up , and gently touch the surface of the toast with the butter soaked knife which will fabricate the delicious combination that is my breakfast. The flagrant texture of the bread has been refined by the hot and entrancing flames of hell from the toaster and shall serve as a tool to satisfy my culinary needs for this sorrow morning of sunday. The hot surface of the toast would incinerate any life form and melt even the strongest metal - but fear not , for I have the only true god in the palm of my hand. I fold the napkin and use it to grab the incandescent toast and raise it at a comfortable 45 degrees angle while slightly opening my mouth. Time passes as the toast seems to challenge me - I hold the napkin like my life depends on it and quiver the shape of my mouth in to a round hole to attempt to cool down the infernal toast , as the cold air travels towards the toast it reaches the surface of hell and emits a monster of steam that envelops my hand - but I'm not afraid because the napkin protects me. I bow my head forward. And then I like flippin' chew on the goddamn toast LOL\\n\\n\r\nI hope you have enjoyed reading this. Because if you didn't you are gonna see me in your nightmares dressed in a maid suit and holding a rose in my mouth.l will then proceed to cover your body in honey and make a bear lick it off.\\n\\n\r\nBut no pressure , feel free to rate this review unhelpful . But before you do that , I advise you to say farewell to your loved ones.\\n\\n\r\nHave a nice day!\\n",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW FOR BOTH SEASONS OF THE SHOW**\r\nEver heard of the phrase \u201cDon\u2019t judge a book by its cover?\u201d Well, Higurashi no naku koro ni is an anime that takes this saying to a whole \u2018nother level. One minute you think you are watching some sort of K-ON clone, the next you are hiding under the covers and cringing at the horrific violence flashing across your screen. If that isn\u2019t enough of a hint, let me preface this review by elucidating the fact that this anime is not for everybody; the sheer amount of blood, gore, and bone-chilling imagery ensures that fact. It's bestthat the faint of heart pass on this one. However, Higurashi is so much more then the mindless scares and random violence that so many horror shows divulge into; it is a masterfully written, well-thought-out, psychological thriller based around an enthralling mystery that keeps you guessing from beginning to end, and it is absolutely fantastic at just about everything it does.\\n\\n\r\nGiving a proper synopsis for Higurashi\u2019s plot is completely pointless because this isn\u2019t the kind of show you can explain properly to people who haven\u2019t seen it. To elaborate, this anime is based on a visual novel, and rather then focusing the entire show on a single arc, you get to see ALL of the arcs. What this means is that there is a lot jumping around in chronology; characters will die in one arc only to come back to life in the next, but it is easy to detect that something is very, very wrong with the town of Hinamizawa. Keichi Maebara and his friends seem like normal teenagers in every arc, but something always seems to go horribly wrong and one or more characters will completely lose their minds. This brings us to the real strength of Higurashi's storyline: The element of mystery. Viewers are constantly trying to figure out what is causing these seemingly innocent characters straight out of a slice-of-life harem anime to suddenly go insane and start slaughtering everything in sight, only to have their theory blown out of the water during the next arc. Not only do these mysteries maintain several layers of intrigue throughout both seasons, they are well written. The reason I enjoy this anime so much is because everything comes together beautifully. By the end, everything you were initially confused about will have made sense and been resolved in a fantastically satisfying manner, no matter how confused you get along the way. Really the only complaint I can make about the storyline is that the pacing of the second season is a bit slow, but considering that the pacing of the rest of the show literally could not be any more perfect, that\u2019s just a nitpick. There is also a minor detail in one of the arcs that never gets explained; you'll have to look it up on the Internet to figure out the explanation, but it's nothing too major. Again, this is nit-picky stuff. All in all, FANTASTIC plot, especially considering that this is a horror show; a genre that is usually shallow.\\n\\n\r\nThe beauty of the characters in Higurashi doesn't necessarily lie in their character development; in fact, Higurashi leaves quite a lot to be desired when it comes to character development. The reason these characters work is because they are all relatable, they are all likable in some way or another, and they are incredibly entertaining to watch. Keichi is a stereotypical protagonist both in design and personality; I recognize that he is nothing special, but he actually has a lot of redeeming qualities that shine through especially in the second season. Also, he has a bit of a dark and disturbing past (NOT in the stereotypical \"my parents died!\" sense that you are probably thinking) that adds another layer of intrigue to him. Mion and Shion Sonozaki, on the other hand, are extremely entertaining to watch and absolutely steal the show, especially a particular one of those two. That is because she is by far the most fun character to watch \"snap\" (almost every character \"snaps\" at some point in some arc). She goes from an adorable, innocent girl to absolute psychopath. In one particular arc, this character will just leave you speechless with her cruelty and brutality; these sisters are truly some of the most memorable characters in anime if you ask me. I won\u2019t go over Rena, Rika, Satako, or the awesome side characters for the sake of time, but consider this: All of the characters in Higurashi are very fleshed out and have depth to them; most of them don\u2019t receive much development due to the fact that this is a show where we are constantly going back in time (every time an arc ends), so true development is next to impossible. However, if Steins;Gate taught us anything, it is that we don\u2019t necessarily need to see change in characters in order for them to work, and Higurashi is another example of that. These characters are all likable, distinct, and they have fantastic chemistry with one another. That makes them very successful in my book.\\n\\n\r\nSome people are very critical of Higurashi's art style, but I absolutely fell in love with the animation of this anime by the end of the very first arc for one simple reason: No anime in existence has ever executed contrast as beautifully and expertly as Higurashi did. One moment the animation will look like it's an over-the-top, moe, slice of life comedy, the next moment, it looks like a dark, stylized, bloodbath. It is executed to near perfection, and the viewers never, EVER forget the incredibly powerful facial expressions of the characters. Sure, the dialogue scenes can be sub-par and the character design is nothing special, but the execution is good enough to repent for these things. The soundtrack is the perfect compliment to the anime. It is uplifting and happy when it needs to be and dark/sinister/frightening when it needs to be. Throw in the show's iconic opening and you have yourself a great soundtrack, especially when you throw in the excellent voice acting. Satsuki Yukino provides what I believe to be one of the best voice acting performances in history with her unbelievably wide range of emotion as the voices of the Sonozaki twins. However, it is worth noting that the English dub for Higurashi is absolutely atrocious. It was so bad that they didn't even bother to dub the 2nd season. Needless to say, stick to sub on this one.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I absolutely LOVE Higurashi. Something about watching stereotypical slice of life comedy characters go insane and start butchering each other is just unbelievably appealing to me, but that's not all there is to this series; it is incredibly well written and will have you on the edge of your seat for its entirety. As I mentioned earlier, this anime is not for everyone, but if you are mature enough to handle it, it's a fantastic thrill ride that I highly recommend.",

            "content": "Innocent Sunrise\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro Ni [Higurashi] is a monstrous franchise that has spawned manga, anime, novels, films and drama CDs, but its roots began humbly enough as a dojin soft sound novel made by a small group of guys by the name of 07th Expansion. The small town of Hinamizawa, a sunny town in rural Japan, was born on that summer afternoon. Wild birds dot the vast landscape, and soft waves of veridian grass wash across the landscape. It's a small place, the local school only having one classroom with about fifteen students. Here we meet the young Keichii Maebara, a newcomer to thetown. Here he spends time innocently enough, playing card games with his friends Rena, Satoko, Rika and Class President Mion. The sunny days idly roll by as the friends joke about without a care, a luxury offered to those not yet immersed in busy adulthood. These days of youthful joy seem like they will never end.\\n\\n\r\nTomorrow is the Watanagashi festival where the townsfolk let small balls of cotton swell with the misfortune of their lives and float down the river, erasing them from the tiny reality of Hinamizawa. The group of friends spend the day continuing their games, horsing around till the sun has finally set and the stars and moon paint themselves across the sky. Tomorrow will just be another day to celebrate. \\n\\n\r\nA woman was found, her corpse burned, while another man had clawed on his own throat till he bled to death. The night of Watanagashi is anointed with their deaths. It's just a coincidence, right? Keichii finds out that this is the fifth set of murders that has occurred on the darkness of the town\u2019s only festival. It can't just be... coincidence. Hinamizawa holds many secrets within the vile folds of its history \u2013 too many.\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi\u2019s plot left me guessing. Until the last few episodes, I never really knew what was going on. The story is dark and twisted, filled with blood, guts, death, insanity and despair. The innocence of the first few minutes of the show is quickly thrown away for an ominous atmosphere, which left me disoriented, but gave the story that much more impact. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Higurashi is structured into seemingly separate story arcs, each representing a separate story. Characters are reused and those that died in previous arcs come back for another round of horror and misfortune. At first, this structure makes a bright, flashing LED \u201cWTF\u201d sign go off in your head, but trust me, by Episode 26, it all comes together. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters gave the same feeling as the plot, apparently na\u00efve and childlike at first. They appear to be two-dimensional clich\u00e9s from any other slice-of-life anime, but as each arc develops, each character is given personality. Higurashi has some of the most memorable characters I\u2019ve had the pleasure of seeing animated, as each tragedy adds layers of depth to each student. \\n\\n\r\nProduction\\n\\n\r\nThe production was aimed for effect, not eye candy. The characters are of the super deformed variety: huge heads, large glassy eyes, barely visible noses and shoebox shoulders. Usually, I dislike this sort of design, but in Higurashi it works. The large eyes properly reflect the disturbances in the character\u2019s souls, adding to the disturbing atmosphere, not detracting. The cuteness of the models against the backdrop of the gore makes terrifying scenes all the more unsettling.\\n\\n\r\nThe town of Hinamizawa itself is deliciously ironic. The art directors did a wonderful turning cheery settings into ominous stages for the next scene. The background itself isn\u2019t anything special to look at, but it gets the job done. \\n\\n\r\nThe cinematography was excellent. I\u2019ve heard Higurashi called disgusting, but most of the gruesome scenes are composed with cutaways and indirect shots. Episodes of brutality become that much more intense when all you can see is a silhouette, and all you can hear is the clank of a baseball bat shattering a skull. \\n\\n\r\nThe sounds of Higurashi were disappointing. The music did its job humbly without stealing much of my attention. My real complaint lies with the voice acting. Keichii and Rena\u2019s voices have an annoying timbre that grated at my senses. Souichirou Hoshi work generally pleases me, but when delivering Keichii\u2019s lines, his acting felt somewhat uninspired. The rest of the seiyuu do a plausible job, but nothing stood out as amazing. \\n\\n\r\nWatchability and Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi will be a hit or miss for the masses. If you can't sink your teeth into the morbid violence, you\u2019ll instantly be turned off. But if such a thing tickles the fancy of the little voice hidden in the corner of your head (the one that asks you to buy a chainsaw and play lumberjack in a crowded train station), then Higurashi will keep you hooked. The mystery is addicting, every arc answering a few questions, but adding another set of riddles to be answered. I enjoyed Higurashi a great deal. I looked forward to each episode, shivering with sadistic anticipation to find out the many ways to skin a cheery, well-mannered anime schoolgirl. I mean, eating entrails is awesome! Did I tell you that this show is not for everyone\u2026? \\n\\n\r\nThemes\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi poses an interesting question: how much can you take till your moral fibers snap, your iron rusts and crumbles and the tendrils of your sanity can no longer hold onto the edges of reality. Higurashi is an experiment of sorts: in what ways can you contort the mind without breaking anything? The answer: not many.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes, there is no hope. There is no light at the end of the tunnel; it just gets even darker. Higurashi is about annihilation, not just of the body, but the metaphorical death of identity, belief and ideals. Certain problems can\u2019t be solved, and certain battles can\u2019t be won. The piece serves to show that the hero can\u2019t always win; sometimes he is trapped, waiting for the system to eventually turn him to ashes. \\n\\n\r\nThe depth of the show is immense, not only focusing on human interaction, but the psyche. Higurashi is ambitious in this regard, surprising considering it all began a doujin sound novel. \\n\\n\r\nClosing Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nWith an interesting mystery, deep characters and a twisted atmosphere, Higurashi is a unique show worth the watch. While some of the sound production could have been improved, it\u2019s only a minor gripe. The story can more than compensate for the small flaws. So turn off the lights, grab your favorite plushie and hold it close because Higurashi no Naku Kori Ni will grab you by the neck and won't let go till the cicadas cry.",

            "content": "Higurashi: a rather dark horror/mystery title praised for its unexpected twists and complex storyline. It is told in a series of arcs that all have a similar start point and their own unique ending. While many found the story to be thrilling and exciting due to its sudden change ups and shocking nature, I found it to be an overly convoluted and jumbled mess.\r\nAs the story progresses, the many arcs are supposed to reveal information about our seemingly peaceful setting and its many troubles, but this is not the case. They are simply a series of disconnected scenarios. As soon as one ended, the writershit the reset button and came up with a different way in which the story plays out. The result? A mystery series in which the mystery is not really ever solved. Instead, the case is changed and re-labeled as \u201cOyashiro-sama\u2019s curse\u201d \u2013 a.k.a. a character snaps and goes ballistic for a reason that is either scrapped and thrown out the very next arc or never truly explained. Trying to discern what was happening was very difficult for me. A series that makes its viewers think is not a bad thing; in fact, most of the time it is a very good thing. However, I found Higurashi to be so jumbled up and confusing that it was unenjoyable \u2013 and not because I was missing a hidden deeper meaning. \\n\\n\r\nBeing that Higurashi is an episodic anime, one would expect that it would be a very character centered story, with each entry unveiling more about the characters as it progresses. However, this is not the case. It is more story-driven than anything, and because the way the story unfolds changes every arc, the characters are the same way. The ways they behave, interact with others, and react to events is constantly changing. While they may react to something in one way in one arc, their actions may take a 180-degree turn just a few episodes down the road. I found this to be quite annoying. It was impossible to get attached to any of the characters because they had no depth whatsoever, or if they did it disappeared along with any happenings of that particular arc. They were just tools to used to try to advance the story, which never really happened. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as violence goes, there is plenty. But there isn\u2019t really any point to it. It just felt like the characters were ripping each other to shreds just for the sake of being shocking and gruesome, like a slasher film. At first, yes it was quite unnerving to see the once good friends turn on each other in such a way, but this effect did not last long. My thought process quickly turned into \u201coh I wonder who is going to murder who next.\u201d Let\u2019s take one of my very favorite series, Berserk, and use it as an example of violence being used to advance the narrative. The violence in Berserk is incredibly difficult to stomach (people who have seen it in its entirety will know what I mean) but the reason it is so effective and meaningful is because it shows the dark and twisted desires of man \u2013 something many, if not most, possess, but very few will act on, and for good reason. In Higurashi\u2019s case, the characters act so unrealistically that the violence just feels like it\u2019s meant to make your stomach turn, nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Higurashi was not actually as abysmal as I made it out to be. The premise was quite intriguing and I found it to be somewhat entertaining for a good portion, but there were many glaring flaws I saw that took away from the series and made it harder and harder to enjoy. \\n",

            "content": "My first exposure to Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, like probably quite a few people, was the sight of a little girl taking a butcher knife as long as her arm, bracing it against the wall, and stabbing herself repeatedly in the temple until she lost consciousness. The girl who was watching her laughing hysterically. Honestly, that's Higurashi no Naku Koro ni in a nutshell; a dizzying but brilliantly choreographed foxtrot through hell on earth.\r\nHigurashi's strongest element is without a doubt its story. Like putting together a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle, it takes a lot of concentration and patience before the picture even becomes remotely clear.This is bound to frustrate some viewers, but those who stick with it long enough are richly rewarded. Another unfortunate bit of this is that the picture doesn't begin to clear up until the tail end of this first season, but that should only serve to spur viewers toward the second season in a flash.\\n\\n\r\nWhat this series does offer up in terms of plot is a convoluted style all it's own. Every arc starts the same, the beginning of June and our six main characters are the best of friends. At the end of every arc, one of them has gone insane and many characters, if not everyone, is dead. Then it's back to the happy start. Yet Higurashi overcomes this flaw by presenting every arc from a different POV and uncovering new information from this narrative style. The progression is slow, but only serves to stew the suspense. In short, the many flaws are not actually flaws. The story is essentially perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThis terrifying yarn is told from the perspective of the same six kids, all of which have a connection to the events that continuously take place. Rather than develop the characters, the anime serves to bring out existing aspects of them gradually. For instance, Satoko in the first arc is grossly different from Satoko in the third arc. The difference is the character hasn't changed, but the circumstances have and therefore we learn something new about her. Often the character revelations are disturbing and serve to deepen or raise even more mysteries, and enrich the complexity of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is not so much as a soundtrack, but ambient sound. The most apparent is the ominous chirping of the cicadas at pivotal moments, an effect which never loses its impact. The OP is sufficiently creepy and the ED, especially the lyrics, tell much of the atmosphere the anime tries to provide. Sound really shines though in the performances. Mai Nakahara and Satsuki Yukino especially raise the bar for terrifying vocal performances.\\n\\n\r\nThe weakest link of the anime though is, with a single glance, the art. Higurashi's animation is not only inconsistent but painfully cartoonish. It works best during the scenes in which characters are freaking out, providing many memorable facial distortions, yet it is otherwise painfully bland and simplistic. Often there is no pronounced style and characters' bodily strutctures and appearances will change for no given reason. The end of the final episode is sufficient proof that animation was not meant to be a factor for this show, and it's really what keeps it from being the best anime it could be.\\n\\n\r\nThough my first peek of the series scared the crap out of me, it only served to make me more interested in it as it progressed and I heard more about it. I enjoyed this series immensely, more than I ever expected to. This being the first half of the series, expect to be in complete disarray for the majority but there's enough here to pay attention to that once things start clearing up, you'll be desperate to recall all you can to put the pieces together, which is where the second season picks up. It serves it's purpose of terrifying and succeeds in being far deeper and more complex than a slasher tale.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Higurashi no Naku Koro ni a 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "Before actually getting into reviewing the anime, I'd like to talk about the When They Cry art box Geneon (RIP) released. The art box is pink, with images of the five main female characters (Mion, Rena, Rika, Satoko and Shion) in maid outfits, all looking either cute or sexy. I'm not sure what the people who designed the box art and picked the colour were on; the art box would give someone ignorant about the series the wrong impression of the show. No sane male would be seen walking out of a shop with it... Can you imagine how embarrassing it would be to payfor something that looks like animated child porn?\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, the reversible DVD covers had someone with a brain design them. One side of the DVD covers is a good (happyish looking, without pink or maid outfits) and the other side of the cover is evil, with shadowy versions of the characters showing. Unlike the art box, you could walk out of a shop holding copies of the DVDs themselves with your head held high. The only issue I have with the DVDs is the infamous volume two misprint where an intelligent person decided to put the episode descriptions for the first five episodes as the descriptions for episodes 6-10. Due to Geneon going south, not many copies were released and even less were re-released with the error corrected.\\n\r\nAnyway, enough talking about the DVDs. Time to get down to business.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nQuite frankly, When They Cry is the hardest anime I've ever had the 'pleasure' of attempting to explain. The reason for this is that the story is told in various question (the mysteries aren't explained) and answer (the mysteries are explained) arcs, with nearly all them being out of sequence for the fun of it. This is further complicated by parallel universes, meaning each arc (each question and answer arc pair are set in the same universe) have no direct connection to most of the others. Are you confused yet?\\n\\n\r\nAll the arcs are set in the fictional village of Hinamizawa, most of the time during June 1983. Changes are made to the characters in each story, varying from them being heroes and villains depending. So, basically, even though the setting and characters don't change, the roles of each character often changes significantly in each of the stories.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening arc reveals that Keiichi, a young boy, moved to the town with his parents a month or so prior to the beginning of the series. By the time the story starts, Keiichi has already become friends with a group of four girls in his class - Mion, Rena, Rika and Satoko. Things soon start to take a darker turn when Keiichi learns that the people of Hinamizawa worship a God known as Oyashiro, said to be the protector of the village. Keiichi discovers that there have been four murders each year on the same day as the Cotton Drifting festival; a festival that honours Oyashiro. Concerned about these serial murders, Keiichi starts to have doubts about his new friends when they lie to him about the murders...\\n\\n\r\nEach arc is a variation of the above theme, with a small amount of information revealed about the mystery in each arc. It's very hard to follow if you have a terrible memory (like me!) and you'll probably find yourself re-watching certain arcs later on to see if you missed anything. If you're looking for an easy to follow series, I recommend you run away now.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also best to avoid When They Cry if you only enjoy light-hearted series. While the character design and story try to trick you into believing it's a kiddy series at first, you soon discover that When They Cry is actually a horror series - a true rarity in anime. You'd be surprised how shocking it is to see a cute face change into a psychotic one, along with the voice changing from soft to menacing. There's plenty of gore on show, too, with the main characters dying on a regular basis throughout.\\n\\n\r\nMy thoughts on the story, you ask?\\n\\n\r\nI LOVED the initial four episode arc. The first episode set the tone of the show by opening with someone finishing beating two people to death with a baseball bat, the person screaming and looking seriously disturbed whilst doing so. After that, the scene changes and, for the rest of the first episode, the story follows the largely uneventful day of Keiichi at school with his friends, allowing the viewer to slip into a false sense of security.\\n\\n\r\nTo my utter disappointment, I soon discovered the truth about the show: Nearly every arc is set in a parallel universe. While it's an interesting and unique way of telling this mysterious story, I couldn't help but feel like the plot was standing still and not moving forward. I started to lose motivation as the story 'progressed', finding it hard to get into a show made up mostly of disconnected stories that will, rather inevitably, link up at the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I did enjoy the unique When They Cry experience. Outside of the parallel universe confusion, the main issue I have is that the mystery is far from solved after 26 episodes and there are still MANY more questions than there are answers... I'll have to watch the second season if I want my headache to go away.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIn When They Cry, there\u2019s a group of six characters that play key roles: Keiichi, Mion, Rena, Rika, Satoko and Shion. Excluding Shion, all of them go to the same school (there's only one in Hinamizawa, the only class being a mixed age class). They are all young, none being older than about 15 or 16, some being pre-teen.\\n\\n\r\nKeiichi, the only male in the six, plays the role of the main character in the first few arcs. Through his eyes you are introduced to Hinamizawa and the other characters. He's a kind, friendly and easy to get on with guy, said to have scored high on IQ tests.\\n\\n\r\nMion plays the role of the class leader due to her age and dominant personality. She's a green-haired tomboy who hides her more girly side. Her family, the Sonozaki's, are the head family in Hinamizawa and she's the heir to them. The mystery of Oyashiro and the mysterious deaths that occur every year on the day of the Cotton Drifting festival seem to be linked to the Sonozaki family. Mion has a twin sister, Shion, who has been thought of as a cursed child since birth (twins are supposed to be a bad omen) and chucked into a distant boarding school away from the family.\\n\\n\r\nRena moved to Hinamizawa a year before Keiichi. A shy girl who has a love of cute things, she comes across as the harmless. However, her past is a dark one and she's known for going into a rage at the mention of Oyashiro...\\n\\n\r\nThe final two main characters are friends and the youngest characters. Rika, a cute blue-haired girl, is the head of the Furude family; one of three main families in Hinamizawa. Much like Rena, she comes across as harmless, but she has the strange tendency to change into a more serious, more intelligent and more sinister person - as if two people are inside her. She will probably play a key role in solving the mystery in the second season. Satoko, a short haired blonde girl, has a tomboy type of personality, mixed in with a lot of insecurity. Her family is hated in Hinamizawa and all are either dead or missing, leaving only her.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also other, seemingly less important, characters that feature on a regular basis. The police officer Oishi and the village doctor Irie make appearances in most of the arcs, Oishi appearing in all of them.\\n\\n\r\nUsually, a reviewer would evaluate the depth and development of the cast when rating. However, this is difficult in the case of When They Cry due to the story being told with parallel universes and the plot not progressing as a whole. I know a lot about the characters after seeing them various angles, playing both the good guy and bad guy, but it's near impossible to rate the development unless I rate the characters in each arc individually.\\n\\n\r\nMy favourite characters are the twins; Mion and Shion. Both characters get fleshed out more than the rest in the first series, a lengthy arc towards the end of the series revealing all about the sisters\u2019 relationship, how their families work and, quite simply, how the sisters feel. The best eye candy (I'm SURE they're 16...well, 99% :D) and character development together - a win-win situation.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing I didn't like about the characters was how they acted rather bizarrely or out of character in certain arcs to play the roles they played in those arcs. For example, one character decided to kill someone to help one of his friends, who he had known for all of five minutes... What kind of person risks going to jail for life to help out someone they don't know very well? That plot point in particular seemed to be a bit forced to me.\\n\\n\r\nI feel that 8.5/10 is a fair rating when, while the characters did have depth, the parallel universe aspect stopped any episode 1-26 character development.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen They Cry uses cute, loli character designs to first fool the viewer and then shock them later. A horror series with cute looks - who would've thought it?\\n\\n\r\nAs you'd expect for a series that aired in 2006, the series is in widescreen format.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good. There's nothing amazing on show here, it doesn't compare to some of the other series that aired at the same time. I'm sure most people wouldn't mind too much; they'd be too distracted by cute young girls who hold meat cleavers whilst laughing in an insane manner!\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality was a little disappointing. It's not an action series, so you can forgive it for not being brilliant, but the few scenes with fast movement that do occur failed to impress me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nRating the When They Cry soundtrack reminds of when I rated the Koi Kaze soundtrack: Koi Kaze didn't have too many tracks that stood out, yet the music fitted the show like a glove.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme of When They Cry is brilliant. Creepy, dark and a little scary, I couldn't imagine a better song for this type of the show. The ED is also very good; a dark, relaxing type of song, part of which also plays during the episode previews.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack itself is made up of the dark type of music you'd expect to hear, mixed in with some cheerful music that plays during the more amusing parts of the show. Very little of the music made me want to download the soundtrack and listen to it on my PC, meaning it has little to no truly outstanding tracks in my opinion, but the soundtrack does fit the show perfectly and that's more important.\\n\\n\r\nJust to give the voice acting a quick mention, the voice acting was as excellent as Japanese voice acting usually is. I was impressed by the performance of Satsuki Yukino; the voice actress behind Mion and Shion. I've added her to my favourite voice actor/actress list after watching When They Cry. \\n\\n\r\nTotal: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I did end the series feeling a little disappointed after the near perfect start, I do regard When They Cry as being up there with the best. It's certainly the best horror series out there... Not that there's much in the way of competition!\\n\\n\r\nMy rating may improve when I get around to watching the second season and the questions the first series raised are answered. However, I feel 8/10 is a fair rating for the first season on its own.",

            "content": "Higurashi is a happy-go-lucky show about a bunch of kids.\r\nWith that in mind, watch it.\r\nThe tags are lying. It isn't horror at-\r\nHad you going.\r\nThis show would do a wonderful job at deceiving you if not for that intro tacked right onto the first episode. If not for that, you'd think you were watching a cute, slice-of-life anime.\r\nThe whole show is a puzzle for you to solve. Why is everybody dying? What drives a perfectly normal teenager to go Freddy Krueger on two of his best friends?\r\nAt times, the underlying problem of Higurashi seems supernatural, at times psychological. Right until the end of the first season,you'll wonder about this show, and more than likely, you'll be wrong.\\n\r\nMy advice is not to overlook Kai. While it may be a whole nother ballgame, it will provide some much-needed clarity.\\n\\n\r\nStory- The anime opens up on Keiichi Maebara, an average enough kid- except you just saw him hack up two people with a baseball bat.\\n\r\nThe two people, you find out, are Keichi's friends, Mion Sonozaki and Rena Ryuguu. For the first episode, you might wonder when you'll get to see that baseball bat again.\\n\r\nIt's coming. And soon.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The art is decent. I've heard people knock on it, but I thought it was really quite refreshing. The show deceives you by taking a lighthearted character design and shifting and mutating it into a slasher movie. \\n\\n\r\nSound- I don't watch an anime if it doesn't have an intro theme that doesn't immediately hook me, and Higurashi's has almost become the standard for that judgment.\\n\r\nIt's beautiful. It's wicked and mysterious. It's mythical.\\n\r\nIt's exactly like the show itself.\\n\r\nBeyond that, the soundtrack works with the show rather well, rather than detracting from it. When you want suspense, the show's soundtrack plays suspense... and it does it damn well. The soundtrack also plays cute, and mysterious, and... well, you'll just have to hear for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- This show is very plot-driven. As such, the characters are hard to follow and to sympathize with at first, because you're never sure whether to run away from them or to hug them. That's why you hold onto characters like Rika Furude, who carry the show's cuteness on their shoulders, and you try to understand the other characters all the while.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- At first, watching this show was a chore. I think I might have seem the first episode, then I shoved it aside, thinking \"Eh. My friend's crazy for recommending this.\"\\n\r\nThen I picked it up again, and I couldn't stop watching. I wanted to know what was going on.\\n\r\nAnd so I kept watching, and in no time at all I had finished with the first season. Then I went onto Kai, and then Reii, and I bulldozed through those.\\n\r\nHopefully, you will too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- For all of the above reasons, I'd strongly recommend Higurashi. The show requires a fair amount of patience, but if you keep watching, you simply won't be able to stop.\\n\r\nWell, the key to continuing is to knowing that there is a rhyme or reason for what you're watching.",

            "content": "\"Since everything is so fun all the time, it's scary to think how it might fall apart one day\" - Keiichi Maebara\r\nPreface:\r\nAt the recommendation of a friend, I started watching Higurashi, no expectations, no preconceived notions. Four episodes in, I was extremely surprised at what I'd found. This was the first psychological horror themed anime TV series I'd seen, and has really piqued my interest for more in the future. I want to use the idiom that Higurashi is like a trainwreck: some desperately grim and dark event that you just can't look away from. However, unlike a trainwreck, Higurashi keeps you glued to thescreen in grim fascination and awe of how the twisted depths of humanity can be so sympathetic, and yet so repulsive at the same time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverview: \\n\\n\r\nHigurashi begins in the sleepy mountain village of Hinamizawa, far removed from the hustle of city life... a place where time moves more slowly, and nobody meets a stranger. Keiichi Maebara is a transfer student from Tokyo, and his life is about to change in a series of dramatic and traumatic events. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Artwork: 7\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi is a little bit of a tossup here. On one hand, the series is quickly approaching 10 years old and looks a tad dated when put up against anime of the last 4 years, but at the same time, the slight roughness of the animation and characters gives an air of camp that fits the 1983 rural Japanese mountains setting despite the low budget, and I liked that.\\n\\n\r\nThe contorted faces, the chibi frog look, the dazzling moe bits, and the brutal blood and gore all have a place here, and it looks good for the most part. There are a few moments where characters lose some fidelity, some out of sync mouths, and a few areas where the key frames were few and far between, but otherwise it's good enough.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe OP, eponymously titled, is appropriately haunting and creepy, complete with visuals to match. The ED \"Why, Or Why Not\" by Hiroyuki Oshima matches as well. I enjoyed both songs and listened to them in every episode.\\n\\n\r\nI don't normally get into the sub or dub argument, but I think it's worth mentioning in this case. The English dub (I watched two episodes of it) was inferior to the sub. The dual personality intensity of Yukari Tamura as Rika was not captured well, and many of the other voices just sounded really forced and flat. The menacing, venomous voices and unhinged frantic rantings that pepper the show were more impactful and creepy in Japanese.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8 \\n\\n\r\nRight from the beginning, you know something is just \"not\" right with these characters. With every passing scene, a little more of the volatility and darkness of these girls (and guys) that look like they came straight from Haremtown by way of Moe Street reveals itself. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike ecchi harems, there's not any nudity to be found here, and the girls don't exist to fall in love with Keiichi. Each character isn't there to check a box or fulfill some idiotic fantasy- they are all interesting and mysterious in their own right. They are all competent on their own, and have their own tragic or just plain ugly backstories that make them who they are. At some point throughout the series, I found all the characters to be sympathetic in some way, and at other times absolutely detestable. It goes back to how the separate narrative threads are arranged with the limited perspective (described below). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters often spout dialogue lines that are foreshadowing the horrors to come, such as the opening quote, which is perhaps the biggest understatement in the entire show. The dialogue is a little cheesy at times, but the protagonists are all kids, so I'll give it a pass.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9 (Eye Opening arc: 10/10) {Time Wasting arc: 10/10, extremely helpful for answering questions}\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi is a slow burn of a story. You're presented with all these disconnected pieces of a puzzle, and somebody kept about a third of them. It really plays well into the general air of mystery and the sense of foreboding. There are a few D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu moments that really tie up seemingly disparate plot threads well, and serve to push the narrative forward, but keep you questioning what else can possibly go wrong. \\n\r\nThe plot itself is split up into 6 arcs which, while watching them, seem to stand alone; but slowly link together as the show progresses. The typical progression is almost comedic slice of life for the first short section, which sounds (and watches) really strangely for a horror/mystery show, but it darkens quickly and reaches a climax with enough revelations and crazy moments to satisfy even the most bloodthirsty viewer. Higurashi would be a good example of a show to dissuade those of the school of \"anime is for children\" thought. \\n\\n\r\nHigurashi avoids many of the typical horror pitfalls with the jump scares and stupid characters locked in a house with a murderer on the loose!! It's too smart for that. The characters have heads on their shoulders, and it's obvious that they aren't crazy just because the plot demands a killer. Everyone has their motivations, a backstory, and a part to play in the plot. Each character essentially gets an arc that focuses solely on them, which allows us to really get in their heads, which really puts what we've already seen in perspective, as we're mostly limited to what the main character of the arc is seeing and thinking. It also changes our perspective on several characters throughout: some characters' motivations don't make any sense until we're seeing the story unfold through their eyes, and the revelatory moments are really incredible, and make you question what you've seen.\\n\\n\r\nThere's an expo dump in the middle of the show, the aforementioned Time Wasting arc that really refreshes the sense of purpose in the show and ties up some loose ends that didn't make much sense previously. Higurashi is one of those shows that makes you feel lied to the whole time: that you can't take what you're seeing and hearing at face value, which for me, enriched the experience of sorting out what the truths were. All is revealed in due time, and in many ways I didn't expect.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nMan, I might 'beat this one to death' by the time I get to the end of this review, but the violence/blood/gore in this show were awesome. I cringed, I sat on my hands, I grit my teeth, and I even felt sick at one point. That's moving, folks. I enjoyed the twists and turns, and felt every stab, every bludgeoning, every nail. There were a couple of times I felt 'torn' on who I should sympathize with, or feel bad for; but at the same time I wanted to root for brutality, because sometimes they deserved it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nIn finishing, Higurashi was a thrill ride of mystery, horror, and pain. There's not much to complain about here... if violence, intrigue, and hurt aren't your thing, you probably weren't reading a review for Higurashi in the first place.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\r\n+ \"There will be... BLOODBATH!\" -Nightmare (Soul Calibur)\\n\r\n+ Deranged, unpredictable characters\\n\r\n+ Plot twists and turns to continually shock and surprise\\n\\n\r\n+\\- Rough animation at times\\n\\n\r\n- Occasional unrealistic responses to threats/danger\\n\\n\r\nRecommend? \\n\r\nYes, Higurashi is definitely a watcher. Awesome blood and gore, twisting and turning story, and insane characters keep you engaged and horrified til your heart's content.\\n\\n\r\n\"I think moving to Hinamizawa made me realize how happy I was.\" Oh, if only, Keiichi.",

            "content": "Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni is the first season of the famous Higurashi (When They Cry) series. The main story is about- Actually no, what is special about Higurashi is that the main story is revealed in the second season.\r\nPeople start watching Higurashi only knowing about a guy, Maebara Keiichi, who moves to Hinamizawa and creepy stuff is supposed to happen next. So until you get to the 2nd season I would totally suggest you not to pay very much attention in the show, but enjoy it instead. It will be gore, lots of blood and numerous crime scenes. That's what Higurashi is all about.If you're into that, just go for it without second thought. But if you're not a fan of animes which include violence and deaths, you're definitely in the wrong path.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, another feature Higurashi has, is to make you totally confused. One of its specials, actually. But don't worry, if you do as I said and just enjoy the show up to the last episodes, then Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Kaku (2nd season) is going to answer to all your questions.\\n\\n\r\nSo now i shall continue to my rating.\\n\\n\r\n-Story: 9-\\n\r\nMultiple ways of deaths, a lot of creepy behaviours, sources of mystery and of course gore. All that, while at the same time the viewer trys to find out what's going on. Sounds pretty cool, right? :P\\n\\n\r\n-Art: 9-  -Sound: 9-\\n\r\nI found the expressions of the characters the most creepy part of the show. Seriously, when I first checked Higurashi out, I thought: \"Some friends/classmates spending time together and having fun, what's wrong with that?\"\\n\r\nWhen I decided to try it out, even from the first minute (especially when I got to the opening, which is an AMAZING song) my mind was blown out.\\n\r\nWho could imagine that such ordinary faces for an anime would be actually the most creepy and violent ones I've ever seen. Big eyes. Loud laughter. Powerful voice. They all look and behave like that when they turn into their 'creepy side'. That was the most decent about the show which was accompanied with excellent backround music, which I gave it a 9. Epic success.\\n\\n\r\n-Character: 8-\\n\r\nI mentioned above what I liked about the characters, still not all of them acted like that, not all of them turned into 'mad' ones. Some of them were very week, not understandable to even childish at times. That is according to my opinion, 'cause at the same time someone may relate to a character I didn't even like, so that depends on tastes most. But all of them had a story behind them, a past. Well, I might learned some things from that. And not only me, but every viewer. Trying to overcome your fears, yourself, your mistakes. Trying harder and harder in order to please or thank someone, fighting for someone or even dying for someone. The creators sure would have liked the characters to pass those messages about life to the viewers, and there are many messages like that, referring to family, love, relatioships between people, and many more as well. All I have to say is that they definitely managed to do it.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment: 9-\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Higurashi and I'm definitely watching it again in the future. It's a really unique anime while it can cause you a mindblown but in a really decent way. I don't know how it does it, but what i know for sure is, that makes me enjoy it and consider it as one of the best animes I have ever watched.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall: 9-\\n\r\nWell, the truth is that this anime is worth a 10 BUT. I dont think the perfect anime exists and I also believe that each every one has it's own beauty, its own \"perfection\". \\n\\n\r\nSo, I will bring my review to its end by saying that Higurashi is an amazing, creepy, gore, mystery and psychological (and horror/thriller as well) anime, giving you the chills by its characters (the most of them), but relaxing you by its art and making you puzzled by its twists and special plot. You should totally give it a chance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n*Note 1: Do not drop it if it scares you, you'll miss the whole action and *advice* watch it on day\\n\r\n*Note 2: Same goes for if you get confused. You'll never manage to find out the main story of the anime, even if you go to the 2nd season you won't understand anything\\n\\n\r\nIt's a really good anime, so if you intend to start it, please don't drop it for any reason!\\n\r\nI am sure you are going to enjoy it, as I did!",

            "content": "A tail of horror and suspense, of intellectual constructs and supernatural phenomenon, of friendship and family, of conspiracies and deities, of murder and self preservation. \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni\" has it all. In 26 episodes and 6 stand-alone arcs it manages to squeeze in all this in vicious, gory detail. While at he same time, dedicates much of the anime to character development and story telling.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\n...And what a story it is! As afore mentioned the story is told in stand-alone arcs, that is, they don't seem to be all that related to one another, and one could exist without the others. Then atthe end, the writers manage to find a way to wrap all of this up, the story arcs that seemed too distant to be part of the same show finally make sense, and that in and of itself is rather gruesome as well. But that wasn't enough to satiate the bloodthirsty appetite of these writers. On top of the gore they had to include psychological complications in the cast that sends shivers down your spine, combining the gore and the mental breakdowns they managed to create a gruesome tale envied by the likes of Frankenstein (reference to the original book).\\n\r\nBut gore isn't all this anime has to offer, plot twists, despite being limited by it's stand-alone arc style, stand on par with (or at least near) \"Baccano!\" and \"Durarara!!\"\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe screen effects are beyond it's years, this anime manages to pull of stunning visuals not found in anime around 2006 outside of the budget monsters (Inuyasha and such). The blood is realistic, though some wounds, like a slit throat, are not shown. It's strange as they will show entrails, but not a bashed-in skull. Still the art style and the non excessive amount of blood gives the violence a very realistic sort of feeling.\\n\r\nNow character art is where my complaint lies. Rika and Satako's designs seem appropriate, and despite myself, I find them rather cute. Rena's personality argues her design, so no problems there. However Keiichi, Shion, and Mion's designs are way out of line in my opinion. It seems the art was dedicated a bit too much towards the blood and not enough on designs for the main cast. However, the story just dragged me right past that by the second episode and the art no longer bothered me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nBeing children one and all the voices of the cast are all very similar in Japanese. In English, however, the voices differ quit e bit, so I personally prefer the dubbed. That said the characters personalities and designs are all quite different so the voices aren't a nuisance in Japanese either. The opening is beautifully choreographed, with an eerie chill that will send shivers up and down your spine. The ending is symbolic, but the song seems strangely misplaced, likely to try and attract viewers, but no points lost there. The soundtrack suits this anime perfectly, interrupted periodically by the call of a nocturnal cicada (higurashi), or a crow seeking out blood.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters are beautifully developed throughout the series, all of them. Even those who get less screen time, the main six (Keiichi, Mion, Shion, Rena, Rika, and Satako), while shrouded in mystery, all have well established personalities, pasts, and are all likable. This show will twist and turn you sensibilities as it portrays it's characters as serial murders one minute and pitiful victims the next. Or perhaps at the same time, the viewer is left to fend for him/herself as any predictability is slowly stripped from his/her hands.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nTruly not intended for anyone who can't take some rather messy details or frighteningly unstable psychology. But I believe anyone would be able to enjoy it, just mentally prepare yourself before hand. With just enough lighthearted comedy in the mix to keep the flavor of this show changing, you'll be anything but bored.\\n\\n\r\nYou're not gonna have time to sit on the edge of your seat, I suggest you take a comfortable position now because once you start you face will be glued to the screen. I suggest you periodically make sure you've remembered to breathe.",

            "content": "Well a friend had recommended this anime to me since I love dark themes and horror.  I decided to give it a try since he seemed to really like it.  However.. I really started to get bored after a couple of episodes.  I tried to give it a chance and force myself to watch more but it just got... really.. boring.  I only had about 5 episodes left to finish but I didn't bother anymore.\r\nIt's basically about a closeknit town with a lot of secrets. Everyone seems normal, and yet they all have something to hide and act suspicious when themain character tries to get answers (he's new to the town). It seems to be connected to the Dam operation that was to take place in the town a long while back, which never happened because all the workers and people involved were murdered.  \\n\\n\r\nLet's just say.. it's very repetitive.  After the first couple of episodes, you'll basically be bombarded with the same story and characters over and over and it can be a bit confusing.  It wasn't even scary and it was like.. you'll know what's coming.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I mean by that is.. basically the series is divided into several episodes as having their own stand-alone story.  However, these stories use somewhat, similar plot and characters to re-tell a seemingly new story.  Think of it as watching different horror stories with the same setting, characters and such. The story and characters are not linear but the setting is.  \\n\\n\r\nMaybe I didn't have enough patience -shrugs-.. Perhaps there was a big twist in the end that may have made up for all the bore before it.. If you don't mind watching similar plots multiple times over then you may be able to endure this.  If you make it to ep8-13 and still feel hooked as you felt in the beginning then you're good to go.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy this, but maybe you will.",

            "content": "To describe Higurashi in a word would be easy. It's bland.\r\nHere you have bland, male MC moving to a new town only to be thrown face-first into a harem full of girls! But wait!!!! Nothing is as it seems!\r\nWhere could you possibly you go wrong?\r\nEverywhere, that's the answer you're looking for.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nLet's start from the top. When it comes to the horror genre, Higurashi has a fairly standard premise: boy moves to idyllic little town, and all hell breaks loose. Unfortunately, the execution of this premise is decidedly sub-par. Higurashi has a solid start, the first arc builds on itself and engages the watcher. Then...Nothing. A bunch of people die, everyone goes crazy, move on to the next arc. That's right. There are no answers. This anime provides no answers. Instead it becomes a shameless attempt at self-promotion. Hey, kids, ya wanna know what happens NEXT? Too bad, you'll have to watch the second season, here have some fanservice to hold you over until then. A good mystery should be able to be solved by the observer, not by spoonfeeding the observer the answers and that's exactly what Higurashi does. It presents an unsolvable mystery and then proceeds to spoonfeed you the answers... In the next season.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 2/10\\n\r\nIt's an eyesore. The only thing that saved it from a one is that the art in the Visual Novel was actually worse. Distorted proportions, lazy animations, ugly and bland colour schemes, you name it, this anime has it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe actual anime soundtrack is highly forgettable, but the OP and ED themes are very well done and fit the mood that the anime tries to create well. The Japanese voice work was nice, and the English dub was okay as well. Save for Rena who's voice will make sure you mute your television.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nThis is where the anime really falls flat. The characters have literally all been done before. To death.\\n\r\nBland, supposedly smart protagonist with no personality? Check\\n\r\nYandere girl? You're in luck! There are several!\\n\r\nForgettable side characters? Check.\\n\r\nCreepy children?\\n\r\nTomboy who secretly wants to be more feminine? Check!\\n\r\nInconsistencies in characters between the arcs? Check and double check.\\n\r\nImplied twincest?\\n\r\nAnd in the characters lie one of Higurashi's biggest problems: it's inconsistency. Characters may be sympathetic one arc and inexplicably unlikable the next. Personalities change on a dime with little-to-no explanation (which can apparently be rectified by simply slapping the yandere label on them). It's hard to like any characters because their personalities are just so inconsistent.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nInteresting for the first one or two arcs. Gets bland and stale after that. Just really repetitive and becomes a bore to watch. Not the mention the art makes you want to gouge your eyes out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nAnother (heh) mediocre entry into the horror/mystery genre. Bland, stale, and far too long for it's own good. Also fails to deliver any scares (and, seriously, isn't that the whole point of horror?).",

All of the characters are such incredible pushovers, they don't make the slightest attempt to help themselves at all.

            "content": "People often say that Horror and anime don't mix and that the genre never really works in such a medium. But Higurashi begs to differ, and it became the most common counter argument against that particular statement. And rightfully so.\r\nThis is a spoiler free review (none beyond episode 4 anyway) and it covers both seasons.  \r\n*Story*\r\nThe story takes place in Hinamizawa, a small town (based on a real life location) where a teenage boy named Maebara Keichi just moved in with his family. And he spends his days playing fun games with his friends. However, it doesn't take long for him to realize thatsomething is not quite right with this town (understatement of the century).\\n\\n\r\nBack when I first watched it, this premise seemed very simple to me... and it is. So I thought I was in for a basic mystery/horror anime. Needless to say, Higurashi is not exactly what I expected...\\n\\n\r\nWhat really impressed me about the story is how skillfully and carefully crafted it is. The first season is separated in to several arcs and each one starts out more or less the same but they eventually take different routes and contain very different developments, turns and conclusions. Each arc is also portrayed from a different character's perspective and leaves you to figure out how one arc is related to the other (if at all). At one point it will throw in a twist that will change the direction the viewer takes to find the answer, that is until it throws another twist on top of it that makes the previous one nothing but a red herring. This is an excellent way of keeping the viewer busy and keeping up the tension while simultaneously keeping him entirely in the dark. This also makes the story complex and is useful in making the viewer's head explode in the process (what the hell is going on!)\\n\\n\r\nThough I must say that it also misleads you in to thinking the answer is one thing, when the fact remains that it's something you had no way of figuring out in the first place. So this might hurt the mystery aspect of the story, since it's a mystery that is nearly impossible for the viewer to solve before the answers are revealed in the second season. On the bright side however, the answer is in plain sight the whole time with brilliant foreshadowing right from the first few episodes. It's just hidden inside a great deal of insanity so the viewer won't be able to see it clearly. This also makes Higurashi more rewatchable and once you rewatch it, you'll know exactly what to look for (OMG! I didn't notice that the first time around!)\\n\\n\r\nSome people are turned off by the first season because of its repetition and the fact that the first half of each arc is basically just slice of life/comedy, but I didn't mind it much in this particular case, since even some of the comedy bits were essential parts of the narrative and it was also a good opportunity to flesh out the characters (not to mention it makes for good build up). So I thought it was handled very well for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nIn the second season the series becomes more of a thriller with an overarching storyline in which the questions are answered. This does mean that it loses part of its charm of being a creepy horror anime, where the viewer plays a game of connect the irrelevant dots. But at the same time, it more than makes up for that by halting its repetitive nature and having more of a steady pace that keeps the viewer craving for more. In addition, things do get wrapped up in a manner that will likely leave you satisfied in the end, but don't expect too much realism out of it since the ending does come off as a little... well, forced.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story isn't exactly Shakespeare, nor does it have any realism or attempt to make sense, since It unfolds very conveniently for the most part and it keeps the viewer in the dark for very long (which is generally not a good thing). The strength it has is mainly in its many details and the unusual presentation that eventually reveals an interesting big picture that was actually in plain sight the entire time. Which is pretty freakin awesome.\\n\\n\r\n*Characters*   \\n\\n\r\nHigurashi is not a harem, but the main cast does consist of harem Archetypes which is to be expected from a visual novel adaptation, I guess (I don't play VNs).  You have a complete moeblob (Omoch Kairi!) 2 lolis, a tomboy and her more ladylike twin sister. Oh, and you also have some adults as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course there's the male \"lead\" Keichi who despite not being the usual harem lead and is surrounded mainly by harem archetypes, somehow ended up being the least memorable character. I don't know how that happened, it's not like he's a blank slate, he's just overshadowed by the presence of harem characters that happened to be very well done.\\n\\n\r\nThey all have some sort of dark past that eventually emerges and they are given a lot of focus. Some of the characters' dark interiors are hinted in the comedic moments as well, which is also very interesting to see. Especially when rewatching. \\n\r\nAnd their chemistry together is some of the best I've ever seen with such characters, it's fun to simply watch them play cards or something. This makes the intense moments all the more powerful because you actually care about the characters involved.\\n\\n\r\nAll they're backgrounds are very rich and they each have certain roles in this small town. They each have some kind of background that is relevant to the plot in one way or another and this is explored pretty deeply until the their backgrounds basically become part of the forefront in the narrative. So this is quite impressive.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters do develop eventually, but it's nothing that noteworthy (for most of them anyway) since the characterization here is very unrealistic and over the top. They're all mentally unstable and there's a pretty good reason for it, but the timing of their insanity doesn't seem to make sense, it just sort of comes and goes when it's convenient.\\n\\n\r\nAnd although some characters are more important than others, when it comes to the plot from a point on, the others still play certain roles, and it does the best in making you feel like their existence isn't just for pandering purposes. And it does that quite successfully. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the characters aren't the most unique, nor are they very realistic. But they are very memorable, well above average for their kind, an essential part of the story and a ton of fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\n*Art*\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are pretty simplistic and generic,  and the animation is passable but at many points looks pretty clunky. It also has somewhat bright colors so it can be all the more shocking when the massacre comes along.  But I think it fits with the (both goofy and creepy) tone of the show and it makes everything look weirder and gritty. I don't think this show would've worked if it had fancy animation with fluid movement.\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are actually very nice, since they're based on real locations. It's actually pretty scary to see how closely they resemble the real thing. \\n\r\nI also liked that the gore wasn't as graphic as you'd expect and it leaves a lot to your imagination. Which adds to the creepiness.\\n\\n\r\nThe directing is great for the most part, which is why Higurashi is a success in horror. But it does repeat a few of the effects a little too often, like having the camera close up on a character's expression at a fast pace during an intense moment. And at times the characters lips don't sync properly to the point where it almost looks deliberate (what's up with that?). It was still pretty cool though.\\n\\n\r\n*Sound*\\n\\n\r\nI would argue that the opening song is still one of the best in anime. It is both creepy as hell and the lyrics are very nice. The same goes for the opening of the second season as well which is just as creepy. The ending songs do fit the atmosphere, but the amount of Engrish is kind of a turn off for me. The soundtrack in general is excellent, though no particular tune stuck with me since it seems to have too much variety or it's either too quiet for me to remember.\\n\\n\r\nI don't speak Japanese, but it's pretty obvious that the voice acting gets very over the top at times. It was still handled well and most notably, there are some very memorable crazy laughs that will give you nightmares. Don't expect the most subtle performance out of it though.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are noticeably good and sound extremely creepy as well. They take up a good chunk of the cinematics.\\n\\n\r\n*Enjoyment*\\n\\n\r\nIt's been a few years since I've watched it, but I enjoyed every second of it. I even liked the slice of life parts, surprisingly.\\n\\n\r\n*Overall* 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Higurashi is smart enough to appeal to the intellectual crowd, gory enough to appeal to the gore fans and has more than enough cute girls to appeal to the moe fandom. \\n\r\nI also think it's a modern classic that excels in terms of atmosphere and will be remembered for doing horror anime right.",

Normally horror does not scare me, but this was different.  Higurashi really lives up to its title.  At each and every turn I was confused, and that does not happen often.  I was drawn in by the story.  While the art left something to be desired.  It did not take away from the experience at all.  The art itself was frightening.  It made me feel like I was there.I know people may fault me for enjoying the dubbed more, but I did.  Watching the dub was more exciting, the voices were well done and I highly recommend watching the dub and sub to see for yourself.  Though it is true that the subbed was almost as good as the dubbed.  Overall the subbed was absolutely the best-subbed anime I have ever seen and heard. The anime was action pack to the brim and the best part was it was unpredictable.  I will not spoil anything for those who want to watch this anime.  I highly recommend that you go and watch this anime without any prior knowledge of this series.  That way you will enjoy it more.  Overall I highly recommend this anime, not just because it is in my top five anime, but because it is an amazing and well put together anime.  This truly is the perfect horror anime.  No recent anime has since has ever lived up to this title, though they tried to.  Thus, I give it my highest rating of 10/10 overall.",

            "content": "The concept of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is one that seems interesting: we are able to watch a small town murder as a mysterious festival approaches in multiple timelines, each one with variations in events that bring us closer and closer to really understanding what happened. This premise seems to suggest it would be interesting to anybody who enjoys horror, psychological, or detective anime, allowing the watcher to appreciate the nuances of a scenario from a variety of perspectives.\r\nIdeally, anyways. Higurashi is a messy anime because although the premise is very good, the art is boring, the individual stories that make up the animeas a whole are mildly unnerving (at first) or ridiculous (later), and the characters are generic not in the sense they are traditional anime archetypes, but in the sense they literally have no personalities beyond what the plot itself demands. The premise, strong as it may be, is doing all the work here.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing interesting to say about the art beyond that it is extraordinarily bland. It doesn't look particularly bad, it doesn't look particularly good, it's just sort of there.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters provide the structure for Higurashi. By rearranging them, their pasts, their relationships to each other, or the actions they take in a given arc, the narrative is shifted. As the building blocks for much of the story present in Higurashi, one would expect them to have fairly distinct personalities. Unfortunately, most are so generic it would be difficult to even describe them in any meaningful way. Higurashi falls into the trap of assuming giving somebody a tragic past serves to characterize them; this is particularly untrue here, where the \"past\" seems to be a tool that can be changed depending on what arc of Higurashi's storyline we're in. The characters seem to spend 90 percent of their time having no personality characteristics whatsoever and the other 10 percent murdering people with shovels.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it is really the story that fails Higurashi. But while the story shows promise in the beginning, as it reveals more of itself it suggests that what is actually going on in Higurashi is far less interesting than we had been to led to believe. It is \"satisfying\" in the sense that we now understand what had happened, but it's deeply unsatisfying in the sense that it makes you wonder if you would have watched the anime had you known already. I will try to avoid spoilers here, but there is a satisfying eerieness to Higurashi at first as revelations come and characters go from good to bad for unknown reasons. The problem comes when we see the results of those revelations and the eventual explanations for them. The tone of the series does not match the explanation created for the premise of the series, and the explanation itself seems silly in the light of earlier episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say this anime is slightly above average because of the strength of its premise, but the ultimate lack of substance in the story and the characters severely detracts from its watchability.",

            "content": "*First Review*\r\n\"When a phone rings in the 2nd to last episode in the arc, shits about to go down.\" This review will contain minor spoilers. Oh Higurashi. Where do I begin with this one. Well this anime takes place in a town named Hinamizawa. In which, a re-occurring theme happens where every year, on the night of the ritual of Watanagashi, someone always dies and someone else disappears. Our main protagonists, the only boy Keiichi, along with Mion, Rena, Rika, and Sakoto cover each of their own separate arcs that usually tells us more about themselves and why they act the way they do..... Also,with some crazy freak out moments. But Higurashi has it's own special feature to it, and this is where I explain why. (Note: I will not talk about each arc in this review.)\\n\\n\r\nStory - 7.5\\n\r\nThe thing I love about Higurashi is the mystery behind \"The Curse of Oyashiro.\" Throughout the story you get the same mystery of what exactly is the curse of Oyashiro? Is it real? or is it not? In each arc, you learn little by little about the background of this Curse and the characters themselves. But, some of the arcs can be less impactful than others, which I take a little point off for. Yet the special feature that Higurashi has to it, is that the person watching this anime is solving the mystery, not the characters inside the anime. It makes it seem like you are one of the detectives inside this anime trying to put all the pieces together and solve the mystery. I won't try to spoil to much but I'll just say it gets 1 point off for some puzzle pieces not being useful to the mystery, at all. Some minor flaws behind the story is the beginning to each arc. When you first watch the episode of the arc, sometimes you have no idea when this is taking place. It leads to confusion throughout the arc and is little answered by the producers. Another thing I had a problem with was the characters in each arc, which I will talk about next. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4: \\n\r\nA major flaw in this anime is the characters in each arc. They seem to shift personalities before the arc even starts. I understand that characters develop differently throughout each arc, but they are already different before the arc even starts. Another thing wrong about the characters WAS their change. For example, Kei was the most useless character throughout all of Higurashi. He did nothing to stop anyone and really could be better off as a side character. But, no... the producers wanted to magically make him useful after all at the end because they realized this. This pissed me off because if your going to keep a character useless, in all of the arcs, make him useless until the end. Do not switch at the very last moment and confuse everyone. Two of the other protagonists, Rena and Mion, their arcs were not impressive nor significant, since they seem to be the closest to Kei. They were short. They had shitty endings. And told us little to nothing about the story at hand. Rika and Sakoto, our other protagonists, were honestly the ones that made this anime. They were so good, I would honestly go back and watch them again because they had great background stories, and had an actual significance on the story. Also, Rika was the savior of this anime. She was so cute, plus she gave me basically the understanding of the whole anime with two fucking episodes. The side characters though were more useless than Kei, besides Akataka and Oishi. They did nothing that changed the plot nor helped with any of the questions you had. You can see their attempts at trying to have an impact, but in the end they did nothing to explain the story, nor change any of the main characters, which is why I rate the characters as a 4. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation 6:\\n\r\nI'll start off with the good things about the animation aspect. There was actually blood in torture and killing scenes. Many anime just don't attempt at this or just fail at doing so. The scenes were realistic though, I believe they weren't over the amount of blood nor to little. In which I commend you Higurashi for taking a plunge no other anime has done before. Now to the flaws, even though this is made in 2007, you can tell some animation designs were just completely wrong. For example, every time Kei enters the cop's car to talk, the windows are white all around him. Also, a re-occurring animation problem was that you can see a pencil outline through their hairline. Let me clarify, if their is hair over a characters eye, you can still see an outline, in pencil, of the character's eye that's supposed to be covered up. I don't understand why a company would do that, it just looks awful on the characters and can be distracting. But I have to commend Higurashi for actually taking a step in the horror aspect and having red blood where it's needed. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nHigurashi has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in an anime. The opening was amazing along with the OVAs. The OVAs were set in the right place at the right time and created an ere and creepy aspect to parts where you know shits about to go down. I have to take a point off though for the ending and the cicada noises. If you hate cicadas as much as I do, you'll get really pissed off at this anime and sometimes may have to even mute it. I think the purpose of the cicadas was to establish a realistic setting and give a momento to the watcher that, \"hey you paying attention\" which can be really annoying. The ending I just didn't find as special as the opening. It lacked the mood to end each episode. The opening does the exact opposite in having a great song, and fits well with the anime. But, if the ending was a tad bit better and cicadas were less involved with the anime, this easily would have been a 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed Higurashi. Many episodes had great cliffhangers that kept you on your seat and made you want to watch the next episode. I marathoned this even though I was planning on finishing it in two days but, I couldn't stop. I always wanted to uncover the mystery of this Curse. The reason though I give it a 9 was because one arc was totally just awful, and had no significance what so ever and the horror aspect didn't affect me, but I can see it affecting others.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nYou know I don't really watch a lot of horror anime because I don't get scared easily and animation is \"un-realistic.\" But I have to give thanks to the creator of Higurashi because they have the best killing and torture scenes I've ever seen and the music just follows up with it perfectly. The big problem with this anime was the characters though, I understand it's an arc, with time skips, yet I know the producers of this anime could do way better as well with the animation. So my final score for this anime tying in all the scores is...\\n\\n\r\nScore for this anime: 7.1 round to a 7/10\\n\r\nRecommendation: Anyone new trying horror, looking for a good mystery",

            "content": "I don't usually watch horror anime. This was the first one I tried and it was very enjoyable. It had it's fair share of violence and gore, but it also had an undeniable creepiness to the story. The anticipation of the horror to come was creepy enough and when it actually arrived it made my heart nearly beat out of my chest. After the first few episodes I was definitely roped in and couldn't wait to watch the next.\r\nThe Story: The story mainly focuses on the mysterious deaths that always seem to occur during the time of Watanagashi Festival. There are three question arcs andthree answer arcs. Each question arc has a different murderer and victim. The Watanagashi Festival and the dam construction project are the only consistancies between them, along with the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I've avoided watching this series for a long time because I'm picky when it comes to animation and this one certainly lacks detail. The background has barely any detail and the character designs are okay at best. But in a series like this, the art isn't of much importance, plenty of blood though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice acting was amazing in Higurashi. There are many times when the creepiness is all in the hands of the voice actors and they did a fine job. At times, their voices would make me jump out of my skin with terror and at other times, their sweet innocent voices would make me believe whatever they had to say. The opening and ending songs had just enough creepiness to be perfect for this show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters were very original and cute. They were so well rounded it was easy to believe the character was adorable even after they murdered someone in the previous arc. Each character developes beautifully throughout the series and it's interesting to see the different ways they interact with each other going from arc to arc.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Much to my surprise I really enjoyed Higurashi. The way it's broken down into arcs with different scenarios made it nearly impossible for me to hold off watching the next episode. Although, with all the build up to the end of an arc, it makes you want more, only to have to start off at the beginning of the next arc. Which made the first few episodes of the new arc a bit boring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I say that this is definitely anime that most should check out, even if you're not much into horror.",

            "content": "Do note that I am reviewing this season of Higurashi ONLY, and that I am not including the events of Kai into this review.\r\nOkay, so, I'm not one for watching any show or movie that falls under the gore or horror genres. Many of my friends enjoy horror and gore, and since I hadn't really seen any before, I was reluctant to start this. This anime was kinda a stumble upon, and from this anime, I started to watch anime on a more regular basis.  When I started watching Higurashi, it was awfully confusing, and it was nowhere near what I had expected inwhat looked like to be a rather simple plot. I could understand why some people may have dropped it, but when I continued watching on, I found it rather rewarding and enjoyable. Just a note that there are a lot of laughing screaming girls around...\\n\\n\r\nIt's kinda hard to explain the plot without giving too much away. To say it rather simply, a young boy called Maebara Keiichi and his family move to what seems to be a relaxed and quiet little village called Hinamizawa. After a few days, he becomes known around the village, and rather easily makes friends at his school. One day, he accidentally finds out about a series of murders and disappearances that take place around the village every June during the celebration of The Shrine God. These murders are believed to be a &quot;curse&quot; that falls upon one, when they have angered the Shrine God. The question remains open to you, as to whether the murders and disappearances are caused by human means, or whether it is supernatural. The answers are revealed to you slowly, and the truth may be a little startling.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was mainly confusing, as I did not, at first, understand the concept of &quot;arcs&quot;. After a while, it became clear that this was more than a simple &quot;who dunnit?&quot; mystery. Each arc presented us with both questions and answers without going so far as to driving our brains into overdrive. The first half of the series told the story from Keiichi's point of view. The unknowns surrounding both him and the audience give us a feeling that we are in the same position as him, and that in order to uncover the truth, we have to decide ourselves what is fact or fiction, who is deceiving us and who are the people we can believe. The second half of Higurashi presented to us many answers. It revealed to us some answers, and the truth that may make you get the feeling that bugs are crawling beneath your skin... Certainly a strong plot, and a rather interesting way of presenting it, it did lack the suspense and tension that are produced by other anime. The plot stays firm, and does not veer off into something else. Everything is related someway or another.\\n\\n\r\nNow, personally, I don't really think you can call this &quot;horror&quot; though. The plot was very complex but the animation is rather horrible and of very low standard. It is very inconsistent and the position of facial features seem to vary every few episodes, giving a feel that this was a rather low budget anime. Don't get me wrong, the character design is fairly interesting, although a lot of the time, the facial expressions, the character's movements and &quot;camera angles&quot; did not match the expressions of what was being said (most notably, the ladder scene early in the series). Thankfully though, the animation is compensated by an excellent soundtrack and outstanding voice acting. The soundtrack is simply beautiful! It matches the tone and mood of each scene almost perfectly. The opening and closing themes were also excellent (despite the closings bad engrish), although there was room for improvement in the opening, but I think I'd be asking too much for an already very good opening. Exceptional performances by the voice actors, especially from Hoshi Souichirou playing Keiichi and Yukino Satsuki voicing both Mion and Shion. Rena's voice seems to fluctuate a lot, and varies every so often. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, so the animation is fairly terrible, and the plot at the start was a little confusing, although after watching it for the season, the complexity of the plot becomes clearer and what is revealed to be an interesting story, which I found very much enjoyable. Interesting and complex characters, high quality soundtrack and outstanding performances from the voice actors makes me give this anime an overall 8.5 out of 10. For those who have watched this, if you haven't already, I would strongly suggest you watch Higurashi no naku koro ni Kai. Kai has many more answers to the series, and ties the whole thing together, although contains much less blood than this season.",

            "content": "Higurashi No Nau Koro Ni is one of the best horror anime out there if you are looking for horror, blood, and murder. Almost everything about it can be seen by its genre (as in you can tel why it got the tags it has).\r\nSo i'll make this short and sweet; Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni is a horror anime but at the same time very adorable.\r\nStory: The story, at first, is very confusing to get with, but after a few episodes you will catch on with it. I thought the story of it was reall great the whole way through and made me lookforward to every next episode I watched. The plot goes alog really well with the characters, and (once you get it) can be reasonable with everything. If you are looking for a good horror anime with a good story going with it, then i think you should watch Higurashi.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I'll make this short and sweet. The art of this anime is very good and at times can be really life like. For me the art was seriously realistic throughout the whole story and was really great to watch. It rocks.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound, like the story, goes along great with everything. The sould can really get you into the mood of the anime. Since this is a horror anime it would have a creepy kind of sound right, well when it gets into the mood it can get that way. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Don't get me started about the characters. They go along really greatly with the plot. I have to say when I was watching it I loved all the characters and how they played along with the plot and stuff. If you watch it make sure to check ut the characters also.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni is a really great horror anime to watch. I think if any horror anime lover would wanna watch it, I think that you would really enjoy it all. So if you watch it have fun. Hope you like it as much as I did.",

The characters are amazing, the story is amazing, the art is amazing, the sound is amazing, and I loved it. My absolute favorite character is Rena Ryuugu, who can go from cute to insane at any time. My 2nd favorite is Satoko Houjou, who is strong(I'm not saying why, because it might be a spoiler), she's cute, and just awesome. And then I love Rika as well, but I didn't really like her until the 2nd season, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai. I haven'tfinished the 2nd season, but let's just say her personality sort of changes. And I like her changed personality better. Once I finish season 2, I'll review it, BTW. My favorite arcs are the Eye opening arc, which is mainly about Shion Sonozaki, and the Atonement arc, which is mainly about Rena. I love the ending theme, \"Why or why not\", which is sung in english, actually. I also love the opening theme, which is just called \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni\". Just to let you know, I do not reccomend the dub. The dub is awful. I reccomed the subbed version. Anyways, I really love this series, and I totally reccomend it.",

            "content": "For years I thought that Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, and it's sequel, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai were among the best Anime I had ever seen. This is in fact the general consensus, that Higurashi is an amazing Anime and it has garnered much praise over the last few years. \r\nI'm here to tell everyone that I, and everyone else, could not have been more wrong about the Higurashi series. When you look at it on it's own, you may see a wonderful story full of drama, comedy, suspense and mystery, but in actuality, you are only seeing a small portion of thestory.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is adapted from a Visual Novel, and for years the English speaking Anime community didn't have any way to read it, since it wasn't translated, so they knew of the Anime (and perhaps the Manga), but had never read the VN. But now the VN is completely translated and can be read by anyone, and it should be read, because after I completed the VN, I realized just how bad the Anime adaptation really is.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply, the Anime adaptations of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, and it's sequel, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai, are a travesty. Roughly 1/4 of the entire story from EACH arc are cut completely, and there are numerous other changes and cuts from what they DID manage to include in the Anime adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nThis adaptation is virtually devoid of the superb character development and storytelling present in the VN, not to mention cutting vital clues that prevent the mystery from being solved. In fact, some people don't even realize that Higurashi is a mystery at all, most people think that it's a suspense or horror series, a series about \"lolis killing people\", when in fact it is a mystery meant to be solved, as well as an emotional drama that the Anime completely fails to capture.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, I would almost say that the Anime of Higurashi isn't an adaptation at all, but a joke that DEEN created to make fun of the original material and showcase their own inability to create a proper adaptation. Some parts of the series don't even feel like the same story because so much is changed and cut, and though you may not notice these issues when watching the Anime by itself, by reading the VN it is made clear just how little DEEN actually cared about this series.\\n\\n\r\nPutting the hackjob of a story adaptation aside for a moment, let's talk about the other aspects of the series. The original VNs had a spectacular soundtrack, especially Kai's, but DEEN decided to just remove ALL of the VN music and replace it with much worse music, often opting to just keep things silent half the time anyway. In fact, the ONLY good part about the Anime, and by association, the only bad part about the VN, is the character design and animation.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have watched the Higurashi Anime, you have never experienced Higurashi. You essentially wasted your time watching it because you missed huge chunks of story and character development, and if for some reason that doesn't bother you, then you are an idiot and should go back to watching your Naruto crap where you can turn off your brain and not care or notice that the story is shit. \\n\\n\r\nIf it bothers you that you've never truly experienced Higurashi, or you've never actually watched the Anime in the first place, I strongly urge you to read the Visual Novel, and forget that the Anime even exists.\\n\\n\r\nOh and by the way, the Umineko no Naku Koro ni Anime is shit too, that doesn't exist either, read the VN.",

The story and plot was outstanding, and it kept giving me high hopes of what would happen next. For those who like Action and Violence Animes, here's one for you. I liked this anime because of the scenes that seem hard to explain, they made it very clear, and the story was a bit confusing to say at the least. If you seem confused after an episode, go back and rewatch it ifpossible. Otherwise, you won't understand the plot at all if you continue on. I give this Anime a 10/10 overall. I usually don't like very violent/blood type Animes, but this sort of changed it all.",

This anime is perfect for a lover of all three of those things.\r\nStory: Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni has eight arcs; Four question arcs and four answer arcs. The real plot to the story deals with a boy named Keichii Maebara. During the series he gets suspitious of his friends. Their are various murders and mysteries during the series. Overall the story really fits with the genres of the anime.\r\nArt: Art of this anime is good, worthy of a 8. Theart really gets realistic when you get deeper into the anime. Their isnt much to really say about the art besides how it gets more ad more real when you get deeper into the episodes but besides that their is nothing else to say.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is really good. The sound realy makes it worthy of being called a horror anime. The opening and ending also fits with its genre of horror. I suppose that if one would watch his anime they would thing the same as I did and say it fits in with the whole horror anime genre. Sound overall gets a 8.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are good. In all in this anime their are 6 main characters and a few supporting characters. Also 5 out of 6 are girls so I guess the anime would be considered a harem. Overall the characters are worthy of a 10 and they fit in with the plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall the whole anime of Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni is worthy of getting a 9. This anim e is perfect for a lover of gore, murder, mystery, and anyother thing related to horror. This anime is one of the best horror anime ever made.",

            "content": "Higurashi is the first anime that I finished by marathoning episodes - it took me three days to finish completely since I had to work in there, but even then, that's saying something for me. I am not someone who feels compelled to sit in front of my computer and watch through a whole series of anime in just a few days unless the story is that compelling - and Higurashi was just that compelling.\r\nThe story is flat-out amazing. While it may seem somewhat slow or even tedious for the first few episodes, the fourth episode will definitely mess with your head as it didwith mine, and the fifth one will completely screw you up. From there, Higurashi takes you on an awesome ride through a darkly disturbing story involving some of the most interesting and compelling characters I've watched to date. The great thing about this anime's story is that it keeps you thinking on your toes throughout the whole thing; this may not be appealing to someone who &quot;passively&quot; watches anime, but for someone who really wants to have to think about a plotline, this is a great anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is relatively good overall, but it shines to greatness when the more disturbing scenes are being depicted. One of the things I liked about the art is while there is a substantial amount of blood 'n guts, Higurashi also works hard with &quot;camera&quot; angles, shadows, and facial expressions to depict images that are plainly disquieting without having to throw in all the blood to get a point across. Also, I personally found the opening sequence to be very artistically beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is horrifyingly creepy - sound effects are used well, and scenes where people are crying, screaming, or laughing manicially (you'll hear all of this and more...) don't feel fake. The opening sequence is also enjoyable in my opinion, although the various poses that the characters are shown in during the opening may not make sense the first time you watch it; that'll change once you've completed the series. As for the ending theme, well, the words to it are hauntingly beautiful in my opinion, but I have to confess that I have never watched the whole thing, usually because I was too busy trying to get to the next episode so I could figure out what the heck was happening!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters...wow. Higurashi does a great job of starting you off thinking about all the characters in one light but then twisting the story around to make you think of them in another. The characters all have deep, compelling backstories to one degree or another, and as more is revealed about different characters' stories and their relations to each other, the more you realize how psychologically damaged and sociologically scarred the characters are. Really, it is difficult to talk about both the story or the characters without giving too much away, so let me just leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this series - like I said, it is the first one I seriously marathoned in my wee hours between working and sleeping. This isn't just because almost all of the episodes end at &quot;HOW COULD YOU LEAVE IT THERE?!&quot; points, but because the storyline they're a part of is so darn compelling that you just have to click on the next episode and keep watching.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this to anyone who is interested in a thought-provoking anime that you have to think on your feet while watching, anyone who loves a story that plays with your head and characters that freak you out, or even just anyone who wants to know what a great horror and psychological anime should consist of. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I would also be quick to note that you should be able to deal with adult themes before you even think of picking up this anime. There is blood, gore and violence, yes, but there are also scenes that are so saddening, so sickening, so disturbing, so desperate, and so starkly human in their emotional content that they'll stick with you even after you turn off the screen...maybe even after you hear the last cicada of the summer cry.",

            "content": "Disturbing to say the least, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is without a doubt a genre boundary breaker, starting with one of the most clich&eacute; settings, changing from harem to mystery in the first two episodes and then from mystery to horror in the next two.\r\nStory:\r\nI assume you've read the generic plot description, making my job a lot easier. This section is 10, hands down. Never before have I been able to witness such a barrage of clever plot twists, original script, terrific dialogue or just plain screwing-with-your-mind scenes. The story begins like an abomination of a generic harem set-up, then slowly builds into thesurreal cat and mouse game, with gore and blood to boot. As if this wasn't enough, it happens SIX times in the entire series, each succeeding to be no less original than the rest. The twists aren't cheap aka. something happening simply because the plot needs it; you can almost expect them because they make sense and take the story to new heights. It's quite obvious the story came from amateurs, with no pressure from their higher-ups, because the originality and the logic of the story are in a league of their own. Having six story arcs with the same characters, same setting, doing the same things and yet ending in an entirely different finale is like watching a playful puppy: you never know what it's going to do, all you know is you can't stop watching.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nSome say the art in Higurashi is too childish to be taken seriously. Some say the drawing quality drags the series to the pits. Some people should watch One Piece. They're quite alike, One Piece and Higurashi, art-wise. Both have a somewhat kiddy look and feel, yet both have been able to turn that into a forte. I used to wish they would've used the sequel's art in this one as well. Then I watched the series again and now I stand corrected. Large heads, with large eyes, hair in all the colors of the rainbow, burlesque bodies and such a clear difference between the style of drawing adults and children fit Higurashi better than any other style. When the faces warp(and they do, when something interesting is happening), they all reveal a darker side within, and, as madness is the carrying tag of this show, the cutesy art fits it like none other. It could've been better later on in the series, as the few action scenes look mediocre. Hence 9.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe title gives out the key element in the sound world of the show. Cicadas are heard chirping anytime when there's a meaningful stop in the dialogue. When in other similar shows this silence is either left as is or filled with thriller-esque music, Higurashi's cicadas (pun intentional) add a horror element of their own. I tried, I really tried, but I couldn't find a single scene where the music or the lack of it wouldn't have been perfect. Hence a 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nHarem Rule # 2: The show must have at least four girls surrounding the male protagonist and should include a childhood friend, an over-the-scale pulchritudinous older girl (who has the biggest crush on the protagonist), an innocent happy girl and a jailbait. Okay, I made that up, but judging by all the harem I've seen it fits. And it fits Higurashi like a glove. And yet Higurashi is not harem. Why is that? BECAUSE HIGURASHI'S A GENRE BREAKER! It's that simple. The characters seem familiar to a general harem anime fan, but cross the genre boundary in almost every arc. The sweet girl next door becomes a psychotic killer, the innocence of the little girl turns into wisdom of an older woman and the hard-boiled jailbait breaks at the slightest of mishaps. Some of the best voice acting I've ever seen play well with these ever changing character types. A ten if it wouldn't have been for the fact that sometimes the show forgets some characters, as if removing them from this arc. The character development is thin this way, which can be a bother to some, but I see the characters don't need development. Besides the development would be of little use, since after the arc changes the development is almost fully erased.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe arc-based storytelling can be puzzling to many people, but those who get accustomed to it fast are in for a roller coaster ride of emotions. Every arc succeeds in trapping you with its first episode, after which you simply have to watch the rest of the arc. After the arc is over you might want to take a breather, but you can't shake the desire to see how they could make a different adaptation of the same setting with as satisfying results as the one you just saw. You could easily spend an entire night watching the show. Like I did. On my SECOND viewing! The rewatchability(err... sorry, not good with words) of the show is the best I've ever seen. There are always some little things you haven't seen, or you simply must feel the magic again and again. The best thing about Higurashi is that if you're able to you can take it one episode at a time, but the sensation is almost the same with an all night Higurashi marathon.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nFew shows deserve to be called elite. Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is not one of them. Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is something beyond elite, rising on the same pedestal with some of the most legendary, such as Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann or One Piece. If you're not shy about blood or sadistic violence (in small portions, of course), pick up Higurashi today. It will make you love every single aspect of it, inspiring you with it's vivid story and lovable but oh-so-fragile characters. It will make you laugh and cry, keep you up at night (even without watching it) and what every good series is supposed to: it will make you want to be a part of it.",

At first, it looks confusing, but as we start connecting the diffent aspects of the story, we start to find answers and then the story starts to really make sense. Thats how i saw it, at first i didnt realize how good the story was...but as it develloped, i saw it was indeed an amazing story. \r\nThe story itself has a lot of mistery, suspense, and action. Even when it seems that nothing will happen, theres always something that is an important detail to the mistery. \r\nI liked it a lot, so i give a 10 in here.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8.5) - Well, for me this aspect isnt that great. Its good, but not that impressive for a 10. The desing is good, but the animations i think they werent that good. However, i want to make this clear, this aspect is definitevely not bad, so i give a 9. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8.8) - The background music fits very well with the anime, i liked it. The opening is amazing in my opinion, the ending is nice and the voices of the characters match with each situation, changing from &quot;happy/cute&quot; voices to &quot;dark&quot; voices...its indeed versatile. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10.0) - Characters in higurashi sure change a lot during the anime, but in my opinion they are all very well develloped, and everyone has an important role to play in the story. there is no useless character..they all are somehow important to what will happen next. Also, i personally like some of them.\\n\r\nSo, i will give a 10 here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10.0) - I really like this anime. The psychological aspect is indeed very good, as well as the mistery and suspense that the whole story gives to us. It really made me pass great time watching, and for it, it deserves a 10.\\n\\n\r\noverall - 10. Not much left to be said, this is indeed a great anime. I recommend!",

            "content": "The feeling that you get whilst watching this murder/mystery anime is that you're observing an elaborate experiment run by a mad scientist (or why not the evil government), in which a bunch of random individuals are placed in some kind of environment and are forced to follow a scenario in which most of them are killed. And then, switch roles and repeat the same experiment over and over again, with no end in sight. Welcome to the world of Higurashi, a parallel universe stuck in June 1983 forever.\r\nIt doesn't take long for us to get to know the main characters as they're all introduced inthe very first episode. They're all students at the only school in the village of Hinamizawa: cute-thing-obsessed \"Hau Omochikaeri~\" Rena, tomboyish class president Mion, likeable Rika, creative and trap-loving Satoko and Keiichi, the transfer student. They're all spending their days playing games, going on picnics and having fun on the annual Watanagashi Festival in June. This goes to show that you should never judge a book by its cover - not long after Keiichi transfers, mysterious killings and kidnappings start to occur in the otherwise peaceful village and the young boy believes that his new friends are involved. This is a story of doubt, suspence, suspicion of the ones closest to you, and most of all - a story of fate . Why fate - you'll see soon enough.\\n\\n\r\nWell, the animation certainly leaves a lot to be desired as the character designs are relatively simple - and I don't mean that in a good way. Badly proportioned, unbalanced and sometimes off-sync with the sound. For better or for worse, the characters' hair and eyes are in all the colours of the rainbow - at least that's an easier way to discern them from one another. Even so believe me, the art & animation improve by a mile in the sequel, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai (only to be slightly ruined in the OVA, Higurashi Rei, but that's a different story.) The scenery and backgrounds are rich and colourful, not too heavy on the eyes and not too simple either. By the way, the village of Hinamizawa, where the story takes place, is based on a real location - the village of Shirakawa, Gifu prefecture.\\n\\n\r\nMy compliments go to the soundtrack! The insert songs have done well to capture the mood of the show, and the opening song (it shares the name of the anime) by singer Eiko Shimamiya is absolutely spectacular. Great job to the voice actors too, for providing excellent voices and giving their all when their characters start walking on the yandere/yangire side. However, what left the biggest impression on me is the sound of crying cicadas which can be heard in the most awkward and most dramatic moments everywhere throughout the anime - hence the name! Such a wonderful way to keep the suspense coming at full blast.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: if you're into detective stories, mindf*ck plot twists and don't mind watching hardcore violence then this is the show for you. You'll be surprised how innocent it looks in the very beginning and how creepy it becomes as you advance. Don't forget to check your front door for girls with a machete tonight.",

            "content": "Higurashi was one of those rare anime that came out of left field and completely floored me early.  It\u2019s a bizarre and twisted little anime that most closely resembles a nasty car accident, the type that you feel guilty about as you look hard when you pass by, but at the same time, you\u2019re undeniably drawn to the wreckage by morbid curiosity.\r\nStory: The basic story of Higurashi is actually broken down into arcs, as the anime is based on a murder mystery PC game.  Thus each arc usually lasts about 3-6 episodes in length before it moves to the next arc, and toa degree, most of the things that occurred in the previous arc seem to have been erased and the show starts over.  The basic storyline is always the same though, as it focuses on a group of school kids in the small town of Hinamizawa and usually starts in the time right before the upcoming Watanagashi Festival.  Each of the arcs tends to vary from both the point of view that the story is told from, to the tales that unfold during the actual arc.  In the first three arcs, Keiichi is the person that we see the story through, but that switches in the other three, as the point of view is switched to different people.  The whole thing comes across as rather strange, as you see terrible events unfold in one arc, and then the next episode, all of the characters are right again and things begin a whole new spiral downward.  While initially fascinating, it started to drain on me towards the end of the show, as you watch these same, likable characters suffer terribly in arc after arc, only to have the story reset itself so that you can watch it all again, but slightly different.  Fortunately, the final arc begins to shed some light into the idea that these arcs aren\u2019t all totally unrelated, and that was an important factor for me.  It seemed like I was about at my breaking point with simply getting tired of seeing the same characters degenerate into madness and chaos over and over, only to have the show reset and begin again, when finally there was something different introduced.  The only downside is that this comes in the last arc, and obviously leads into the second season, where you\u2019re likely to get more answers.  That reprieve comes at just the right moment, as the initial shock value of the show tends to wear off later in the season, and you\u2019re just left wondering why exactly you\u2019re watching the repeated destruction of these characters.  In the end, the story is both horrifying and intriguing, and the show throws you a lifeline when you need it most to keep you along for the second half of this ride.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: They are what make Higurashi work, the characters that are so very likable that you can\u2019t help but be rooting for them every single arc that they somehow manage to make it out of that particular story unscathed.  The first arc is probably the best in my opinion, because the first few episodes actually come across as being close to your typical school comedy show.  Keiichi is an instantly likable protagonist, and the girls are all likable in their own ways.  Thus when the insanity starts, it makes it that much more profound as all the characters you liked so much, seem to be spiraling into madness and murder.  All of the characters of this show have an intense duality to them, with perhaps the only exception being Mion.  The cast in general switches from being likable, silly characters to insane and ruthless, and it\u2019s often jarring and unexpected.  This is a show where even the most moe characters have tragic back stories, and repeatedly have tragedy befall upon them.  I have to warn potential viewers that while you will likely these characters, it appears to be that the main reason they are so likable is to make it that much more impactful when they have to deal with the terrible things that will befall them later.  And there are a lot of terrible things that tend to happen to these characters.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation: Higurashi\u2019s art is something that is often hit or miss, but I suspect that this is largely intentional.  Sometimes, the art borders on bad, with cheap animation or sloppy character designs.  But those weaker art styles seem to give way in a blink to the crisp, sharper images that often accompany scenes of insanity or brutality.  Again, you get the impression that the art was used as another tool here to really make the crazy scenes that much more intense.  The music is all around decent and helps add to the atmosphere a lot, and the opening theme which shares the same title as the anime is hauntingly beautiful.  The entire intro really gives you some clues as to what kind of ride you\u2019re likely to be in for.  From top to bottom, Higurashi isn\u2019t a show that really excels at music or art, but it excels in the concept of using what they have to the best effect.  Thus while the art certainly isn\u2019t on part with a great number of other shows that are out there, it uses it\u2019s art better than almost any show I\u2019ve seen in a while, and it gets high marks from me for that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: Higurashi is a shady, crazy little anime that may leave you wondering why you\u2019re enjoying it, if you have the stomach for it.  Certainly, I can\u2019t say this is a show for everyone, as it\u2019s incredibly brutal at times.  Some of the scenes are downright disturbing, and that can take away from the show for a lot of people.  I found myself really enjoying the show early on, but the repeated effect of seeing these likable characters subjected to repeated madness, murder and torture begins to wear down the enjoyment from this show.  As I stated before, the series throws you a lifeline at the end, giving you a ray of hope at the idea that in the second season, things will be revealed and perhaps there is a way beyond all this tragedy.  But the first season only begins to hint at that, so the initial love for the show was tempered for me as it continued its relentless assault of brutality and cruelty.  It\u2019s probably not as gory as a lot of different anime out there, but I found it often more unpleasant to watch because you like the characters.  It\u2019s easy to see violence perpetrated upon characters you don\u2019t care much about, but seeing characters you like do that to each other, is something else.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I definitely recommend Higuarshi to those people who are looking for something a bit darker, perhaps more deviant.  It\u2019s not always an easy or even a fun show to watch.  Despite the type of show that it is, it\u2019s still an enjoyable show in its own way, and it\u2019s certainly a unique and interesting anime.",

            "content": "Horror in anime usually doesn't have the best reputation. It tends to have a big hate crowd. If done right, horror can be scary and even identifiable because of our fears of things like people stalking us at night, killers, and even telling the truth. For such a unique anime like Higurashi, it doesn't get as much hate as some other horror titles. There are people that hate this anime, but not as much as those other shows. So what makes Higurashi different then those other anime?\r\n\tIt has subtly, I'll explain it more as the review goes on,but Higurashi just has smart writing and great animation tricks to get their audience to feel the weight in a scene. Whether that would be a depressing scene or a terrifying scene. It just knows when and where to get their audience scared and when to make them feel bad for a character. It flip flops from being a light-hearted slice of life, comedy show into a dark, psychological, horror show and back again in the span of an episode. Now, let's go into the scary, psychological, and horrific world of Higurashi.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t\t\t                 ----STORY----\\n\\n\r\n\tHigurashi has just really great pacing. You'll have the characters in a diner or a car talking and it always adds to the plot. The viewer will find out things about a certain character or multiple characters just in these simple scenes. There's not a lot of filler in Higurashi and what makes it different from others of its genre.\\n\\n\r\n\t As the viewer goes threw this show, they start to figure out clues of episodes before it. Higurashi is like a jigsaw puzzle, the viewer is given a piece of the puzzle and has to put the pieces together. There's a catch though, they don't have every piece like they thought, so they try to guess what it might look like from the pieces they got. Higurashi is a good show to watch if you want something challenging to think about but not too hard to understand.\\n\\n\r\n\tHigurashi does have it's corny moments though, like the characters will talk about friendship and how they'll stay together like a family. It will turn some people off from the show, but if you trudge your way out of that, you get some really heart pounding moments throughout the show with some really well developed characters and a well paced story.\\n\\n\r\n\tNow, why does Higurashi give people chills down their spine? Well here are a few theories as to why it works so well. You don't have to agree with any of them if you don't want to.\\n\\n\r\n\tReason #1: The viewer is never sure who to trust in this anime, the murderer could be anyone, Keiichi, Rika, Satoko, Mion, Rena, Shion, the list just goes on. Each of the characters mentioned has their own story arc in the show. As you uncover the sheets, you see their true colors and you just want to trust them, but they all just have this demon inside of them that you just don't know how to feel about them.\\n\\n\r\n\tReason #2: It always starts somewhere humane. The viewer gets to see something they can relate to, like playing with your friends on a hot summer day with tons of laughs and smiles. So when it does go in a different direction, it feels like your best friend is about to murder you with a knife.\\n\\n\r\n\tReason #3: Higurashi is good at catching the viewer off guard. Just like a joke without any unexpected twist to it, it could fail. Not in this show, just when you think you've uncovered everything, it catches you off your defense. If you were to show this show to someone and didn't show them the description, the opening and ending theme, or the genres of the show, they'd be terrified. Those are theories as to why Higurashi works so well where others have failed.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t\t\t       ---ART & ANIMATION---\\n\\n\r\n\tThis is a mixed category when talking about Higurashi, the animation studio that worked on this was Studio Deen back in 2006, who did such well known titles as Fate/Stay Night and Fruits Basket. The art style is something that turns a lot of people away and they think it's too \"Moe\" for this show. The art for the characters actually helps give it that creepy edge this anime is usually known for. When the viewer thinks these are just going to be some just cute anime girls in a slice of life show, then they will surprise you by being really terrifying people.\\n\\n\r\n\tHere's another aspect of the character designs that work in the show's favor. The faces for when the characters go insane is scary and what give a lot of people the chills. It helps out the fear in Higurashi and what people think when they hear the words, \"Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni\"\\n\\n\r\n\tThe animation can definitely be slow and lazy at times, like they reuse animation from earlier episodes and it's very obvious, but when the animation is lazy, it then goes completely great. When the characters are terrified or when they go crazy, the animation wants the viewer to notice that. The Studio plays a lot of animation tricks like having shadows over a character's eyes or when they have exaggerate the facial features. They put in as much detail as possible into the animation for those particular scenes.\\n\\n\r\n\tBackgrounds are very memorable and beautiful. They use paintings of houses and grass which looks great and fits into the scene they are placed in. The audience will never forget them, as they are used in memorable events and scenes in the anime.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t\t\t                    ---SOUND---\\n\\n\r\n\tWhen talking about the voice acting, let's only talk about the Japanese VA's. The actors put as much emotion into their characters as possible. When a character goes crazy and laughs, they do sound like they're that character. There's never a moment where you feel like there's an actor doing the voice, you feel like a character is there. The Higurashi sub is overall a great, scary, and well acted sub.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe opening just added so much to the show. When you watch the first episode and this opening comes up, you know you're in for one heck of a scary and depressing ride. Add to that some really creepy visuals and bone chilling background music, and you have one of scariest openings out there.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe ending had a Japanese singer sing the lyrics into English and if you don't like the sound of those types of songs, the ending theme won't really satisfy you. On the other hand, if you liked the visuals in the opening and don't mind that type of singing, you're in for a real treat!\\n\\n\r\n\tThe soundtrack is also what added to the psychological nature of the show. With tracks like \"Henka\" and \"Matsuri\", it always knew a way to get your blood pumping and get curious of what else was to come. Placed in some of the scary scenes, it blended well into the background. It felt natural and like you were in this world yourself.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t\t\t           ---CHARACTERS---\\n\\n\r\n\tCharacters seem cliche on the surface, but when you dive deeper into the water, you find broken and tortured people. Every character gets their own story arc and then we start to understand their real self. Almost every character has something unique about them that sets them apart from other archetypes. It's hard to talk about why without spoilers, but the characters are almost all memorable in their own little way.\\n\\n\r\n\tDevelopment in characters is also another strength in Higurashi. The viewer gets to learn about every characters past and why they've become the people that they have. It makes it more realistic and makes a lot more sense for why characters feel, act, and believe the way they do. Instead of them just being insane people without any reasons why they are the way they are.\\n\\n\r\n\tSupporting characters aren't as used as the main cast. Most are just used in one story arc or are generic. Higurashi doesn't focus on it's supporting character cast and it would've been nice to see a bit more focus on them. The only supporting character that gets a lot of screen time is a detective named Ooishi, who tries to help the other characters solve a case. The other characters could have been focused on a bit longer, but that's the only complaint about the characters.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t\t\t                 ---ENJOYMENT---\\n\\n\r\n\tYou need a strong stomach in order to watch and enjoy Higurashi. It gets really brutal at some points, so if you don't really like those types of shows, avoid this one. If you enjoy a nice mystery with some horror and gore in there, definitely see this one.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t\t\t                    ---OVERALL---\\n\\n\r\n\tOverall, Higurashi is a great horror, mystery, and psychological show that deserves all the praise it gets. It has some faults, but if you can overlook them, this is a great watch. Great story, soundtrack, characters, and background art.\\n",

            "content": "Characters/Development\r\nThe first several minutes of the first episode will introduce you to the five main characters, showing off their personalities and ways of interacting with one another, having fun and enjoying themselves. This appears to be a typical day of school, with a happy atmosphere and touches of comedy, which then suggests a cute series of friends. However this leads the audience in the wrong direction leaving quite a surprise later on with the use of violence, horror and mystery as indicated by the short sequence at the very beginning. Show here is a young man&rsquo;s shadow holding a baseball bat being bashes against somebodies, blood scattering about while some gruesome sounds take place bringing up questions about what exactly is going on? Not only does that add to the horror aspect, but so does the opening sequence which has quite a large creepy vibe about it where the flowers add quite a bit of irony to the series, yet the butterflies can signify change and a form of link between individuals, such as twins which are presented in the series.\\n\\n\r\nAmongst each of the five main characters have their own unique personalities and other likable preferences, yet during the series you will begin to notice a few personality changes or as if they were being possessed. Keiichi is the only male within the group who seems to get on well with everyone and cares a lot about his friends. Then there is Rena, an innocent looking girl who likes to collects all sorts of cute items and visits the nearby junkyard to find such objects quite often hoping to find a brand new pile of junk. Apparently from the local police officer, she has quite a mysterious background and past. Mion is a little more of a tomboy at most times, however she does show off a more girly side when scared or in worry. She appears to be part of a high-class family of the village, again with quite some mystery behind it, her family and herself. Satako is a little girl who appears to have a slight uptight personality from time to time, yet she can be quite sweet and childish as she cries for her brother. And finally Rika, another cute and sweet little girl yet seems to have a mysterious side about her as well, seems to know quite a lot too. There are of course several other characters that play major roles within the story, each of course with their own personal touches.\\n\\n\r\nThe story however doesn&rsquo;t flow between twenty six episodes, but in fact spread out across in different story arcs with two different approaches. Question arcs, and Answer arcs, while one arc explains some facts closer to the end in two episodes, yet also adds a few other questions. These arcs are of varying lengths and presented to the audience in a different type of order. The question arcs take place during the first half of the series while the answer arcs will take place during the latter half. However, not everything is covered up, and holes are still left dug up and it&rsquo;s up to the audience to relate the story together quite like a jigsaw puzzle and working out a solution. This adds a bit more to the enjoyable experience for the audience as they get to have something to think about or analysis, however for others it can come across as confusing.\\n\\n\r\nThe general flow of these story arcs usually have a beginning, plenty of events taking place during the middle where questions arise, development of character will take place and the general stuff. Then of course an ending which doesn&rsquo;t fully conclude this piece of the story, where a decision to the correct answer arc will take place closer to the end of the series. Development of the characters is rather good as we learn something new about them during each different story arc, their changes of personality, the mysteries about them and their relations, and even experience some mental state changes. Each of the characters will have something of interest to know or learn about, usually explained to the audience, or more specifically Keiichi, throughout many different characters depending on the arc. There is quite some violence that takes place in the series, some of which can make people rather squemish due to the nature of these scenes, which come across as quite sadistic while the character&rsquo;s victim is going through a certain torture or death.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Scenery\\n\r\nThe art style used for the character designs is quite simplistic than in other usual series, of which use a small amount of detail and lots of bright colour tones have been used throughout them. This is what would expect in a children&rsquo;s series, however the lighting effects have been done considerably well adding some realism to their structure. Other noticeable points of the style are the small size of the hands and feet, the thin look of the arms and legs that seem to take place during many scenes. Close up shots throughout the series during the more latter parts are used to show off some ugly sides to the characters where their eyes are larger with small pupils when they start to go insane. This overall style isn&rsquo;t too bad though and the characters aren&rsquo;t defined by using thick lines as a transition between the backgrounds and other parts of their design.\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds were made fairly well with a variety of locations throughout using a different art style to that of the characters. They use a lot of warm colours, rather than brighter tones, with plenty of detail to make the scenery visually appealing and quite realistic. Many locations used for specific scenes use some very nice lighting effects which can helped emphasis some form of drama or mood taking place during some of the many scenes, especially a few exterior shots. Animation wise is rather average throughout where all the simple actions are done in a simple manner. During scenes that use more movement are done so and quite well, but could have been done better and makes the animation quite a disappointment for such a show but definitely watchable. The violent scenes however seem to have the most detail in this department making them come across as more sickening.\\n\\n\r\nAudio/Music\\n\r\nSound effects throughout were moderated and used well throughout. The cicada noises that are constantly heard seem to add both a warmer feel to the series yet a disturbing evil vibe and worked considerably well making certain scenes appear creepier. Background music was generally consisted of creepy tracks but the show was generally quiet which helped add a bit of suspense in there as well. As mentioned near the start, the opening theme was fantastic setting the overall mood of the series perfectly, quite mysterious and creepy due to the use of odd introduction sounds and chants. Eiko Shimamiya does a good job of the vocals and creates an enjoyable track to start each episode off with. Never had a problem with the voice actors and quite liked the picks for both Keiichi and Satako.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nMysterious story split up into different arcs that is put together and developed throughout the series. Several likable characters with plenty of learn about each of them, while the flow of the series keeps at a good pace. Average yet quite disappointing animation, with bright toned and simple art style for characters and warm colours for the appealing backdrops throughout.",

            "content": "Higurashi No Naku koro ni is my very first horror anime and is one of my most favorite shows of all time. For this review, I will focus on the story, character and enjoyment. {Some light spoilers might be included}\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nHigurashi consists a very creative story that knows where it's going. It might seem like your average plot of protagonist moving into new village and encountering sinister things. However there is so much more going on behind the scenes that slowly unravels throughout the show. At times the story might be confusing to follow. Some people might tell you this anime is filled with gore,however this show paces it's gore so well that I felt the absence of any gore at all throughout the whole show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nFor the most parts the characters are very likable, before the crazy things happen, the show takes time to show the innocent sides of the characters before turning them hostile. However when they do turn hostile, you can see the darker sides of the characters that might change your perception towards these characters.  The story also focuses on a lot of internal struggles within the characters and how their struggles take over their body and drive them into insanity, which provides a lot of good scares for the audience.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.5/10\\n\r\nHigurashi is a very thrilling ride and I enjoyed every second of it, from the cute and friendly moments to the terrifying and thrilling moments. Some of the comedic jokes felt sort of cheesy. However most of the scares had me sitting at the edge of my seat. I know that most horror fans enjoy jump scares, well if you are a fan of jump scares, then you won't find any while watching higurashi. This show is all about psychological horror rather than jump scares, which I don't mind at all. \\n\\n\r\nTags: Yandere/ Yangire/ Horror/ psychological \\n",

            "content": "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is one of the best anime to ever come out IMO. It starts as a fun slice-of-life show to extremely rapidly turn into a dark, mind-torturing, incredible psychological thriller.\r\nThe story is absolutely astounding, I always liked the \"arc\" thing, here it is made of perfection, win, and roxxance, to use vulgar and big terms. And I'm weighing them. All the mystery surrounding Hinamizawa makes you think as much as the main character.\r\nThe animation is basic, not much to talk about it. The sequel deals better with this issue. But as it is basic it is also agreable to view, soit's not a real problem.\\n\\n\r\nThe voices of each character are... it's like, there were no seiyuu, the characters are talking as if it ONLY was the characters talking. Not a thing to reproach. I personally LOVED the musics. The opening is addictive and matches the show's mood, the ending although being sung in English by a Japanese singer -- and seiyuu (Rekka Katakiri) is quite good. The cicada sounds used throughout the anime is the best sound effect that could be chosen for this series, it makes you anxious, curious... Just perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters look normal at the beginning, but as soon as something weird or discomfortable happens, they show their real selves and are really scary every single time you see that. It's crazy how great it is.\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro ni is without a doubt one of the greatest psychological thriller/horror anime. Not a bit exaggerated, scary for real, a priceless storyline, just stop staring at this page and buy the DVDs.",

            "content": "This is my first review so sorry in advance for how horrible it is most likely going to be.\r\nStory (7):Higurashi is a very intersting anime yet may not seem so until quite late in the series. At the very end of Higurashi i thought that the story was creative and brilliant, but that was the problem. \r\nNot until the end or the last half of the series did i actually start to really enjoy the anime and start to understand what was going on. But once you do you start to see how good the series really is. But this means sitting through all thefirst arcs or question arcs each with there own strengths and weaknesses and each a story in itself giving very subtle clues as to what is really going on. And i found asking the audience to sit through them with no explanation a big ask. \\n\r\nBut then the answer arcs kick in and proper clues to the overall mystery are given and this is when what is really going on can actually be figured out. \\n\r\nIf the story was of this standard from the start i could have easily given it an overall of 9 but then again if it wasn't set out the way it is it would lose its impact so it's a dilema. On one hand i found myself quite bored in the first half of the series alot of the time yet on the other hand in the second half i was hooked and thought it was done brilliantly.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8): I know alot of people dont like the art and animation of this series but i found it enjoyable 'offness' of it seemed to fit the series and i liked the colours used.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8): The opening and ending songs are very good that once the series gets a further in fit quite well. \\n\r\nI didn't often take notice of the background music of the series so most of the time it didn't add or distract anything from the series, but occasionally i heard something i thought was done quite well and actually did add something to the series but never heard anything i thought was done terribly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9): There aren't many characters that stay essentially the same through each of the arcs of the anime and i found myself enjoying this fact. When you think you actually knew a bit about a character they could change and this kept the anime at least a little interesting even when the story or other aspects let it down.\\n\r\nEach character seems to be pretty much insane through each arc acting very normal and calm in horrible situations not caring about gruesome things people might have done and this not affecting there realtionship what so ever or in a very minimal way, yet acting like morons in everyday situations. This was one of the only constants for most characters and in most animes i would have most likely hated this fact and rated the character score very low but in of Higurashi i very much enjoyed that they were like this and honestly im not sure why.     \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7): For the same reasons Story was let down so was enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7): At the end of this anime i was tempted to rate it higher for how much i enjoyed the last half of the series, yet in the end i left it at a seven as i thought the first half let it down quite a bit. \\n\\n\r\nI am expecting the second season to be very good even if it keeps the same formula as the first series though as there is at least some explanation of the story so i'll just have to wait and see how much i enjoy it.",

            "content": "No spoilers, and yes, I have seen the second season. There are some notes about the second season, but this review is mainly for this first season.\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro ni was one of the worst failures I've ever watched. You can tell what it's trying to do with schoolgirls going around with cleavers and torture devices killing each other, and even though many of us have the guilty pleasure of watching that, it doesn't make up for the horrid writing and inconsistency. But on the bright side, it still passed as entertaining for me.\r\nAs a story that's built on multiple arcs told from differentperspectives, it should at least stay consistent with it's characters and plot aspects. But this doesn't do that. It's ridiculously inconsistent with the characters among each arc, with them acting in completely different ways in different ones. There's the argument that can be made that that was intentional (mostly explained in season 2), but I don't like it. If the characters are going to have opposite and bipolar personalities in different arcs, am I watching one show? Or a collaboration of plot devices? \\n\\n\r\nOn top of unevenness among the characters, the story was just plain choppy. It's one of those stories that wants to be like this: throughout the show, many perspectives from different characters and time periods are shown, and as it ends it all ties together to create a story with explanations for most of the events. And this show does achieve that... sometimes. I'll avoid spoiling, but it seemed to me like there were some explanations of events that were thrown in just to tie a bad ribbon over it all. It's really kind of sad seeing a potentially great plot being brought down by lazy attempts to get things to make sense. And it's not that I'm shallow and can't understand the obscure storytelling; there are so many aspects of the plot that should be resolved (to me) yet aren't, not even in the second season. Granted, the story that unfolds in the second season is much more solid. But even the themes of the story were so unbalanced. There's talk of so many different grim things: a demon legend, a virus, schoolgirls trying to kill each other, child abuse, torturing, suicide, and a few more that I've lost track of. I completely understand the appeal of all of this edginess, but in the end you'll likely end up with a bad mixture of genres to the point where the arcs barely share a common mood. If some edginess is going to be thrown in, don't leave it floating there so out-of-place.\\n\\n\r\nHorrible, disgusting writing. Here's a prime example from this Higurashi no Naku Koro ni:\\n\\n\r\nBoy accidentally causes fire in kitchen. Two girls come in and help him put it out.\\n\r\nBoy: \"Thanks... hey, why are you in my house? This is trespassing.\"\\n\\n\r\nNo normal teenage boy makes an accusation like that immediately after he gets his life saved. No one. And things like this are scattered quite frequently throughout the whole show. Again, I'll avoid major spoilers, but here's what comes to mind: a relatively sane cop spills investigation details to a boy after being simply asked, a normal boy almost immediately thinks to murder someone after hearing that someone abuses a child (instead of telling an adult? k), a girl and boy remain friendly right after she had began shaking the ladder violently and nearly causing him to fall... and many, many more. If you think there's at least one thing wrong with those situations, be aware that this show is filled with it. And it's not just the writing of the events; it leaks into the actual lines too. They're not only beyond cheese, but they just don't make normal sense sometimes. No instances come to mind right now (besides the prime example up there), but I'm sure you guys know what I mean when I say these characters don't talk like people do in real life. And not in a way that you can dismiss. It really is extremely unrealistic.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'll go more in-depth about the characters. There isn't much to say, and that's not a good thing. They're so strange and act so randomly that I can only give consistent personality descriptions to a couple of them. The main boy, Keiichi, is everything that annoys me. I recently finished school, and there's someone I was glad to finally be away from, but then I watched this show and was shocked from getting to know Keiichi who was pretty much the same person. Keiichi's annoying because he does ridiculous things, says ridiculous things, tries so hard to act outgoing but comes off as nosy, and self-deprecates with no substance. The other girls aren't as bad, but they leave a lot to be desired too. They may have some consistent personality traits and harsh backstories, but there's nothing else to them. Like I said before, they seemed like their personalities were shaped just to fit the puzzle-y story. Slaves to the plot with some kawaii garnish.\\n\\n\r\nI don't criticize art much. I understand that different styles are all over anime and manga, and I won't insult any because they've all got their own audiences. But the art and animation in Higurashi no Naku Koro ni was very lazy. Mouths don't open wide when characters scream, mouths open wide when characters are whispering... there are some things like that. And yes, we've got goth lolis who are supposed to be teens yet have eyes taller than their abdomens, which I dismiss for the sake of open minded-ness, but there still wasn't proper detail in the drawings. I don't go for this area also because I have no idea how low the budget could've been, so I'll leave it at that. On the plus side, there were some minutes of amazing animation. Also loved the background drawings.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack fit well. The main theme is actually one of the reasons I wanted to start this, being unsettling and atmospheric.I expected more atmosphere from this show (something I treasure very much, @Monster and @Texhnolyze) especially contributed by the music, but it wasn't anything groundbreaking. Catchy and eerie opening, a calm outro to reflect on the chaos you'd just witnessed. Not knowing Japanese, I'm not one to judge to voice actors, so I'll just say I didn't hear anything off with them here (besides Keiichi's very annoying screams). More of what I minded were the changes between high-pitched and low-pitched voices among the girls. Yes, wow, you're bipolar and hiding a scary deep-voiced personality under your soft schoolgirl appearance. And that's when it's impossible to take it seriously anymore.\\n\\n\r\nSome of you guys might be thinking, \"This is anime, it isn't supposed to be realistic. Don't judge it that way; your standards for it are way too high!\" They're actually not. If they were, I'd have quit anime a long time ago. It's this show specifically that wants to be realistic and seemingly try to show the chaos in human nature (there's no other natural reason for schoolgirls to go around killing each other). However, if you're going to make the story realistic, at least the majority of the other aspects must be as well. I'll have to avoid spoilers again, but I've got to leave it at the fact that the mixture of realistic and supernatural causes was poorly done here.\\n\\n\r\nI'll talk about some positives now. What am I saying... schoolgirls killing each other? Heck yes. There's plenty of that and it's as entertaining as you think it would be. The downside was that it's so hard to take the show seriously when it's characters and story were terribly handled, but we can still enjoy the garnish of edge. The atrocious writing turned it into a bad comedy for me, where I laughed at parts when characters were acting so unrealistically you'd think it was trying to be bad. Even the insane collaboration of wild themes was entertaining to see. You can see kawaii moes in one episode and torture devices being used on them in the next.\\n\\n\r\nAs for some feedback on season 2, it was admittedly better in a critical sense (an actual solid story, writing that made more sense), but it just didn't entertain me the way season 1 did. In fact, the characters turned even staler. But this is a review on season 1, so I shouldn't go any further on that. There's plenty here already.\\n\\n\r\nIt was so bad that it became something I wanted to continue. \"So bad that it's good\" isn't something I've seen for myself before, but this is it.",

            "content": "This anime was a heartbreaker for me, and not because it's sad, but because the first third of it was unbelievably good and had me foaming at the mouth for more, the mid part was a bit worse but was still pretty good and the end was a complete dumpster fire. This anime had all the potential in the world and completely blew it in the end by leaving out multiple critical plot details and leaving several important questions completely unanswered.\r\nArt-\r\nI was skeptical that this art style would work for an anime that is trying to be creepy but it works super well. It's aperfect contrast to what is, at its core, a dark and very gory experience. For me this added a lot to the show and they really nailed it. The intro and outro sequences are both gorgeous.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nReally good intro song, good outro song and solid voice acting throughout minus a few moments where the young female voices feel a bit over the top. The moments in which the girls are being creepy are well acted and they definitely feel unsettling to watch. There were definitely a few moments that made me jump or feel chills and the sound, both the effects and the acting, had a lot to do with that.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack as a whole didn't feel particularly important to the anime, other than the aforementioned intro song that I thought was really good, but a lot of the time the songs in the background were really nice and perfectly fitting to their scene and well worth listening to outside of the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\\n\r\nThe story is both the best and worst part of this anime. It's a fantastic, genuinely creepy premise and the way the story is explained in the Wikipedia page is amazing. Like, one of the best anime stories of all time and I'm ridiculously into this and can't get enough kind of amazing. And, if you play the video games or do some outside looking into and understand all these things, great. However, if you only watch the anime, which is solely what this review is based off of, several absolutely critical details are omitted and you'll wrap this anime up with a whole lot of (very valid) questions. Huge plot elements are simply unexplained, period, and that's super disappointing as you end up with a feeling of a fantastic premise with a ton of buildup that simply never sees its resolution. I loved what this show tried to do, but the execution toward the end was terrible.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nThe first third of this show- specifically the first two arcs- blew my mind and had me creeped out, intrigued and on the edge of my seat in the best possible way. The middle section wasn't as good as the first part but it was still quite good and kept me interested. The last section was a complete dumpster fire, train wreck, botched operation or whatever metaphor you'd like to use and it felt like a convoluted mess and not at all like a conclusion. I don't see how anyone can watch this anime, not do any outside looking into to fill in the gaps and feel satisfied with its conclusion or like they have a clue what's going on. This anime built me up for an utterly satisfying conclusion but ultimately left me bitterly disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nFantastic premise and amazing start let down by terrible execution and lack of explanation or resolution at the end.\\n\\n\r\n+Fantastic premise\\n\r\n+No shortage of genuinely creepy and unsettling moments\\n\r\n+Art style and background music work really well with the product as a whole\\n\\n\r\n-Absolutely critical plot details that appear in other versions of this world inexplicably omitted from the anime\\n\r\n-Quality of the latter part of the show noticeably worse than the former\\n\r\n-Lack of answers/resolution\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- 6\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 7",

            "content": "Higurashi... is not an anime I got into when it first came out. In fact, I didn't get into it until shortly before Kai started airing. I regret this.\r\nIn my opinion, with the exception of two characters (Teppei and Rina), the entire cast is absurdly likeable. My personal favorite is Keiichi, who is an inspirational dork who makes sure we know why he's KOOL. Rena is a sweetie who you should be careful not to anger. Mion is a tsundere with a creative streak for coming up with games and punishments. Shion has a lot of love in her heart, even if it doesn't seemlike it. Satoko behaves like an annoying brat, but there is a hidden side to her that makes you want to protect her. Rika behaves with an astonishing maturity for her age. And her catchphrases &quot;Mii~&quot; and &quot;Nii~pah!&quot; make you want to eat her up. And that's just the main cast!\\n\\n\r\nThe art... is actually astonishingly bad at points. XD But for whatever the reason, I like it. Perhaps I have this mentality that makes me believe that horror anime is supposed to have bad animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds send chills up my spine. That's fitting, considering Higurashi began as a &quot;sound novel&quot; (basically a visual novel, only with more emphasis on sound).\\n\\n\r\nI confess, I'm not really a horror fan. That just goes to show how wonderful Higurashi is, to draw someone like me in. I enjoy Higurashi (I use present tense because Higurashi is a series I can enjoy again and again) and I am looking forward to the animated version of its &quot;sequel&quot; (so to speak), Umineko no Naku Koro Ni, also made by 07th Expansion.",

            "content": "Ah, Higurashi. This really is a horror anime, but not much so that it's all dark. Each arc is half light-hearted and fun, and the other half is dark and very, very bloody (with the cotton drifting festival in the middle).\r\nThe art, for starters is, honestly, not that great. It's in-between \"okay\" and \"good.\" The repeated use of content/facial expressions when the character is obviously in a totally different mental state is jarring, to say the least, but at the same time, I don't think it fully portrays their transition from a sane to insane mentality. Both the OST and Voice are excellent. (The OPand ED stick with you, and are great reflections of the series.)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very well done. While some may be a bit cliche at times, or even annoying, you still feel attached to them. If they are in pain, you are in pain. If they are happy, you're (for the most part) happy. (Just watch out for your fingernails...)\\n\\n\r\nThe setting is original, and completely fleshed out. (Now, I know the \"small town\" vibe may seem cliche, but the way that it's handled in the series, especially with the amount of people in this seemingly small town, is masterful. It really feels ALIVE.)\\n\\n\r\nEpisodic value is fabulous. It has you sitting on the edge of your seat, wondering what will happen next. However, while there's not any \"filler\" on this non-stop murder train, episodes (and time) jump, making things hard to follow. While this is on-purpose, it's still there.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall storyline is pretty good. Things may not always be clear, but questions end up getting answered eventually (for a majority). Ideas may be a tad cliche, but are drawn out and integrated wonderfully. Ending is fulfilling in some departments, but also leaves quite a few questions unanswered, making way for season two.\\n\\n\r\n\"Higurashi\" is a really strong series. While the art may take a little getting used to, as well as the way the story unfolds, it truly is a great show, and will have you sitting on the edge of your seat (or standing 30 feet away from the screen, depending on the type of torture being invoked on a character).",

            "content": "If you're expecting a, beautiful, nearly flawless horror masterpeice...watch something else. However, if you need to satisfy that itch for bloody violence, chilling stories and adorable little girls who are actually deranged psychopaths, [i]Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni[/i] may be exactly what you're looking for.\r\nThe style of storytelling is very unique. Basicly, it's a series of different \"chapters.\" Just about every chapter ends with several people dying, many of the main characters going insane, and at least one person dying a horrible, bloody death. However, when a new chapter begins, everyone is alive and well as if nothing ever happened. This style, although original andusually intriguing, is bound to leave you confused. It feels especially jumbled and thrown together when they bring up events from previous chapters that, given the events in the [i]current[/i] chapter, make no sense whatsoever. And when they realize this, they come up with the most ridiculous, unbeleivable excuses.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as we've seen in shows such as [i]Junjou Romantica[/i] and [i]Hanasakeru Seishonen[/i], director Chiaki Kon has a real knack for delivering her works in such a way that you don't realize their flaws while you're watching them. I give her, and the series, props for this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art was really nothing special. Although the characters look pretty great when they've completely lost their minds, the animation during the happy moments is mediocre.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors were at the top of their game. I thought that Mika Kanai (Satoko) and Satsuki Yukino (Mion and Shion) were especially talented in this series. As for the soundtrack, nothing too special. The right tracks were used at the right times, but none of them really blew me away.\\n\\n\r\nFrom what I've seen of the English dubbing, I say stick with the Japanese. Most of the English voice actors were either trying too hard, or not trying hard enough. The only person who I really thought did a good job was Jean Smart as Rina Mamiya, a character who only appeared for one episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I wanted to get to know the characters, I never felt like I really understood any of them. Keiichi, the main character, is about as dull as they come, despite his few moments of triumph. While the rest of the main cast did intrigue me, I can't say I really got who they were and where they were coming from.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDespite all of the flaws I've listed, I can still say that I thoroughly enjoyed watching [i]Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni[/i]. It made me laugh, it gave me chills, and it pretty much satisfied my horror craving. As I said before, Kon delivers her stories very well. Even though I had seen many of the bloodiest scenes on YouTube before watching the series, they still scared the crap out of me in context.\\n\\n\r\n[i]Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni[/i g]ets a bit more credit that it deserves, but definitely deserves credit. It is a very flawed and jumbled, yet very interesting and disturbing horror story that it is, overall, satisfying in the end.",

            "content": "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is possibly the most unique anime I've seen to this day. So much about it is good, so I'm going to go ahead and get started.\r\nStory:Story is really where Higurashi excels. The story itself follows several different arcs, each one having a fairly different storyline, but following the same general base.  Without spoiling too much, it's hard to explain exactly how the arcs work, but each one has you questioning the villain until you find out later on.\r\nArt:The art style of Higurashi is what puts off a good bit of people I've talked to from watching it.  Personally,I like it, especially the grimmer parts of the series when it takes a bit of a shift into the surreal and insane side.  Still, it's different than any other anime I've seen, and is pretty astounding.\\n\\n\r\nSound:The voice actors are pretty incredibly done.  The soundtrack is mostly good, but I didn't care for the opening or ending.  I rarely like openings or endings though, so that probably doesn't mean much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:Higurashi has well developed characters and appropriate voice actors for every character.  Determining a main character could be quite hard since each arc follows somebody different, though most would agree on Rika.  My small problem with the characters comes from the fact that my favorites are rarely in it.  Doctor Irie, Akasaka, and Tomitake are all very minor characters, except Akasaka actually has his own arc.  I would mention Ooishi, but he is in it enough that I don't have to complain.\\n\\n\r\nI know there are people who say \"It's an adaptation of the original, it sucks!\" But to look at it as an adaptation and not the anime itself isn't really fair.\\n\\n\r\nI'd say that Higurashi is by far the best anime in my opinion.  I've never been a big fan of the horror/mystery genre, but Higurashi has gotten me quite into it.  Yet, as deep into the horror and mystery genre it is, it still manages to be incredibly funny at moments.  Whether or not you like these genres, it deserves at least a chance, as does everything else.",

            "content": "I believe that when you have horror in the way of just mass murders and bloodbaths it is quite boring, because most of the cases it is just a really messed up person who feels good by doing it and nothing else. So, when I get to see an anime that has the horror but mystery and psychological aspects as well I really get excited about it, and this show surpassed my expectations by a lot.\r\nStory & Characters:\r\nHigurashi takes place in a little town called Hinamizawa where a group of friends live their lives as normal students until the Watanagashi festival happens and the Oyashirosama curse makes all characters lose their minds and so begins the slaughter.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is divided in question archs and answer archs, each arch has different character as the main one. An important thing to know is that in the last episode of every arch all the characters have died in many cruel ways, but in the next episode everyone is alive and the story begins again.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes each arch different are subtle things like who you gave a doll to. This actions then trigger the madness in some of the characters, after the Watanagashi festival btw,  and leads to the unavoidable massacre.\\n\\n\r\nEach arch also provides with different clues about what is actually happening, but some of the things that occur makes you rethink of what is true and what is just something a character has imagined.\\n\\n\r\nKeep in mind that you will have to watch the second season, Higurashi no naku kori ni kai, to fully inderstand what is going on and to get all the answers of what is going on.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is probably the only thing that isn't really good. The characters animation is not so good if you compare it to other anime released that same year(i.e Death Note and Code Geass).\\n\\n\r\nBut then we have the \"higurashi face\", this is the face most characters have when the curse of Oyashiro sama arrives, an essential part of the shoe's greatness. The look of despair and madness of the characters is just so amazing to the point that you realize that the animation suits the show amazingly well.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of higurashi is awesome, it fits perfectly with the scenes each piece is reproduced. You can feel the horror and despair just by listening to he ost. This truly tells the incredible capacity Kenji Kawai has when making music.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending give you an idea of what the show is about, and for me this is a really important thing basically because most of the times I don't read what the genres are of the anime I'll watch or the description of it. So I want to have as much information from the opening, ending and first chapter, and I must say that higurashi fulfilled my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nSomething very important about this anime are the voice actors/actresses. You can understand all the work they must have done to achieve such awesome performances, specially when it comes to the laughs, those incredible laughs at the time of the murders fit so perfectly it seems unreal.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that says why japanese voice actors/actresses are so incredibly good is the fact that the voice actress that plays the role of Rena is the same that of Nagisa from Clannad.\\n\\n\r\nI can't recommend this show enough. If you are into this king of anime then you will totally enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of my all time favorite anime and you should totally watch it.",

            "content": "Going into Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni, I thought I was going to be scared to death of it. I had not watched any other horror anime at the time and I was always terrified of scary movies like Psycho. But I actually really enjoyed this show, and also discovered that for some reason anime in general doesn't seem scary. That may be different for you so if you really can't stand blood or creepy moe girls, don't watch this show. One thing this show does have is \"uniqueness.\" This show is unlike anything else you will probably ever watch whether you like it ornot.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season of Higurashi is made of of about four or five arcs telling the story of the two weeks around the cotton drifting festival in a small town in the middle of nowhere. The story centers on a group of kids who are all extremely mentally disturbed in one way or another. The show starts off very lighthearted and looks like a comedy-moe anime at first aside from the very first scene of the first episode and the opening song. The first arc is told with Keiichi as the central character. In this town, there is a sort of deity worshipped by some people (mostly the crazy characters) who a continuous pattern of deaths and disappearanes over the past few years around the cotton driting festival has been attributed to.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people don't like how the first season seems to have no plot at first and just jumps around showing as much gore as as possible, but this is not true at all. While you don't really know much about what is really going on until later in the first season and into the second, it definitely is all connected and it makes for a very interesting plot in the second season though there is less gore if you're just into that.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Higurashi is very strange. The characters have very moe designs (as I've said a few times already), but this just helps to contrast the happy and gory scenes. The sound...well there isn't too much. Mostly just cicadas chirping in the background. Every times I hear cicadas in anime I think o Higurashi (which means cicadas I think, everything translates the title differenty).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, as I already said, are all psychologically disturbed. My personal favorites are Keiichi, Rena, Satoshi, and Shion. Keiichi is the main character and serves in most arcs other than the first as just a mediator to move the story along. Rena is a girl who enjoys everything cute as well as being a devout worshipping of the shrine deity (yeah she's one of the super-crazy characters). Satoshi is the older brother of one of the main characters, though he himself is mostly seen through flashbacks since he was one of the people who went missing from the shrine deity's curse. His relationship with Shion is one of my favorite parts of this show and it makes him my personal favorite character in Higurashi. Shion is the twin sisters of Mion, another main character. I won't say much about her since she isn't even introduced until the second arc and anything else would be a spoiler.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I was surprised how much I enjoyed this gory, violent, brutal, moe show. Higurashi may not be all that scary, but it does have one nailripping scene which grossed me out to the point where I had to look away from my laptop for a while. If you like Higurashi already then I recommend Shiki and Another for you which are both good horror/gore shows as well and have similar setups though they are all completely different shows.",

            "content": "[SPOILER WARNING]\r\n -\r\nStory, Art, Sound and Character: 3.125/5\r\nEnjoyment: 3/5\r\nOverall: 6.125/10 (or 3.0625/5)\r\n -\r\nAfter hearing so much about the so called Higurashi, I decided to try it out, and found my taste to be as horrible as always (well, I disliked Death Note so it is to expect), well, at least this is what I think it is, since I'm the only one to think that this series is rather... bad.\r\nFirst of all, to the good things: Higurashi's terror is top notch. One of the best in anime. Each scene is well scripted and does creep you out. The sound is great, specially the ambient sound,with the cicadas \"crying\" which set the mood amazingly. The character, while not that likeable, are really well developed, and have actual depth.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with all of these, what makes Higurashi fail amazingly? The plot, and the art.\\n\\n\r\nNow this may seem strange but I found the whole plot really tiring, not because the outlook isn't great, each arc's premises is great and when the plot reaches its climax, it's awesome. The main problem is the amount of time that is spent to reach there. The anime tries to make a \"fooled ya\" by being slice of life with just some small amounts of suspence here and there and slowly (VERY SLOWLY) reaching the ultimate terror.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two reasons why it fails:\\n\\n\r\n1. On the beggining of the first episode we are presented with a preview of the \"ULTIMATE TERROR\", where Keiichi kills Rena and Mion (this isn't a spoiler, it's literally the first seconds of the anime). This completely breaks the \"fooled ya\" effect since we already know what's coming, and rather than fool us, Higurashi just keeps us waiting, bored, until something happens, you could call Higurashi the Paranormal Activity of anime, you look for the scares like a fucking where's Waldo game. Not that I don't understand why they did that, because, sincerely, if it had been full slice of life without that sneak peek I would've dropped the show.\\n\\n\r\n2. Once you got the hang of it, it becomes a bore (even worse than it already was), despite all these things, Higurashi's first arc was one of the best, due to its suspence and all. It never felt badly paced since we were just discovering this world. So what happens on the second arc? SLOW. No seriously, SLOW. Seems like the writer forgot we didn't got back in time like the character, that we already know shit's coming, and that we don't need you to repeat everything thousand of times. It's really sad when Higurashi instead of picking up already, spends 2 or 3 episodes on its mediocre slice-of-life (sure, some is useful for character development but in this case I'm talking about the useless ones), specially when it has one of the best horrors out there.\\n\\n\r\nBut even then, I gave it a 6, why?! Because when it picks up, oh, it picks up. The Tatarigoroshi-hen arc (also known as \"Curse Killing\") became one of my favorites psychological horrors of all time, and a high point on Higurashi, since it only spends 1.5 episodes on the slice-of-life stuff and even the it's mostly character development.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I've already put my opinion on Higurashi's dreadful pacing on the table, what the Art has to offer to us. Well, nothing. It's not original in any way, it feels just like that other anime that disappeared after some months, or that other one, or that other one, or that other one. But it brings even more mediocreness, as the characters suddently become higher or smaller to make the cinematography better. The heads are really small for some reason and it makes me uncomfortable, probably explains the dumb shit the characters do, not enough brain.\\n\\n\r\nThese things made my enjoyment go really downstairs, specially since I had high expectations on this anime after the 1st arc. The second arc is m\u00e9h, the third arc is amazing, but then everything goes downstairs in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSo should you watch Higurashi? If you're okay on having to pass through all the mediocre SoL, yes. If not, you should just go see something else, or watch only the first arc.",

The first episodes are the scariest I've seen in anime and the rest of them are \r\nvery intriguing. It does however became a bit repetitive in the latter half of the season. The soundtrack helps the show to create an unrivaled sense of atmosphere. The show keeps you on the edge of your seat and keeps you in the dark but gives you enough clues to keep you guessing. Higurashi is also at times very funny which makes the disturbing parts hit even harder.\r\nIf you are a fan of mystery,horror or shows with an unconventional structure I highly recommend this show.",

            "content": "There are some shows that when people hear about them, you know there going to be - \r\nA) Really Good\r\nor\r\nB) Really Bad\r\nWhen I first heard of Higurashi it was because of a youtuber name GRArkada, A name that many of you are probably familiar with. Looking at the title and the art of the anime, i didnt expect to much. \r\nBOY WAS I WRONG!\r\n~STORY~\r\nDue to spoiler reasons im going to imagine that you know how this story lays out. I will say that this style of story telling I like. It doesnt spoon feed you the answers to whats going on and you have tofigure out whats happening and why people are dying. The story will keep you guessing till the end.\\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTERS~\\n\\n\r\nThe show has a pretty large cast of characters so ill go over the basic ones.\\n\\n\r\nKeiichi (I probably butchered his name) - He is new resident in the small village of Hinamizawa. Being that he is new he is unaware of local legends such as Oyashiro curse. Outgoing, but hides a bad past.\\n\\n\r\nRena - Other than being my favorite character, rena is the outgoing, lovable, some what child-like character of the series. She is very nice but hides a...dark side.\\n\\n\r\nShion - Mion's twin sister. An outgoing girl that acts as the leader of there small group. Next to be the head of her family, she has alot of stress and influence in the show. \\n\\n\r\nMion - Shion's twin sister. Mion is like her sister but is not associated with the family. It's revealed during the show she had an interest in Satoshi. Because of this a chain tends to occur with her and satoshi during the show.\\n\\n\r\nRika - A little girl with more to her than it seems. On the outside she is an average 7-10 year old girl with an outgoing personality. However though, she is a very reserved, very intelligent girl with a very dark side. \\n\\n\r\nSatoko - Rika's friend and the most mentally traumitized character (In my opinion). On the outside she outgoing, playful, average little girl. However she holds something of a mental scar with her. A very dark, depressing past.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this show really play a major role in the development of the story. Each character has some kind of dark hidden past. Each deal with it differently. And each hit there limits in different ways. In other words, they help with the story's progression and the development for each other. But each character is a ticking time bomb, waiting to be set off.\\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~\\n\\n\r\nFirst off - I love the op and ed of this show. They represent the show well in tone and pace.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly - The tracks played during the show is usually the same melody with different instruments. But it does it VERY WELL. However though anything else played during the course of the show is mostly forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nThirdly - The dub is awful. Doesn't matter how much I praise this show...that dub is pathetic. Go sub...seriously....do it.\\n\\n\r\n~ART~\\n\\n\r\nThe art is both a hit and miss for me. Usually the show has a slow pace, so theres no need for over-the-top animation. However, even when the show picks up at each arc's climax the animation stays the same. This isnt a bad thing, in fact at times it adds to the horror aspect. But it's kind of ridiculous that the animation doesn't pick up to fit with the show. But hey, i'd rather have smoother animation than stop screen portraits.\\n\\n\r\n~FINAL THOUGHT~\\n\\n\r\nThis show is amazing, however it is not for the faint of heart. Not to mention because the way the show is, some might get confused, others lost, and some will drop it. The show is defiantly not for kids and should viewed with knowledge that you will see blood, gore, death, violence, crusifiction, torture, and abuse. I am not kidding either. If you can handle this however, I highly recommend this show. Theres a reason It's a personal favorite.\\n\\n\r\nRating - BUY IT (If you can find it)",

            "content": "It is June 1983. The heavy battering of a baseball bat can be heard and we are only left to imagine what it is striking at or who is holding it. The bat accidentally hits the light bulb. Everything in the room turns to darkness. The battering continues. Blood bursts in different directions, all over the room. The boy starts panting, but he doesn\u2019t stop the repeated violent blows with his baseball bat. An intense feeling of horror can be noticed in his wide open eyes. He suddenly stops. The sound of blood pouring fills the empty silence in the room. He drops the bat.The two girls are as good as dead \u2013 their bodies are drenched in blood. The expression in the boy\u2019s eyes never once changed. It remains the same. Horror.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening scene of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is extremely visceral and even though it lasts less than 30 seconds it leaves its mark like a wound on the body of its viewer. Thus begins a brutal tale of mystery and terror that will lead the audience down an unsuspecting road filled with imminent darkness that only awaits its release. Such is the violent, raw nature of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, also known as When They Cry (or When the Cicadas Cry, if you will) and we are only left to wonder, and fear, what comes next.\\n\\n\r\nWhen They Cry is not your typical anime, or even horror anime for that matter. The first episode starts in an easy-going, casual manner and it is confusing to try to figure out how that disturbing opening scene will connect with these seemingly innocent, even humorous events that fill in the rest of the episode. Nothing seems to stand out or hint at a possible disaster, which is rather bewildering and troubling. One thing is for sure, though: something is terribly wrong and we all know it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of When They Cry is divided in a series of chapters which take place either at different times or in a completely different timeline. Several events may unfold in different ways as the chapters change and another scenario is introduced. The anime is centered around the strange events that take place in the village of Hinamizawa during the course of a few years. The main characters are a group of teenage friends who attend the local school, each of them carrying a different past and various secrets.\\n\\n\r\nEven with its affinity for gore and violence, When They Cry remains more of a psychological mystery filled with intrigue and intelligence. The story is incredibly well-written and its creative power and originality feels incredibly fresh and unique. It is not very likely that you have witnessed something even slightly similar to what When They Cry offers. There\u2019s a lot of gore present, but it is used in well calculated doses and at appropriate times. Disturbing scenes are not missing here either, and you will find yourself shocked and surprised at how effective and intense they can become.\\n\\n\r\nThe best quality of When They Cry is the characters and their development. Every character present in the story has a purpose and a well-written personality. It is incredibly impressive how this anime can take a character which feels so familiar and clich\u00e9 and turn it into a bloody killing machine in a matter of minutes. We start to learn more about every character and their inner self as the story progresses and the distressing events start to kick in.\\n\\n\r\nIt won\u2019t be an easy ride going through the whole anime. There will be times when it will be too confusing to even begin putting all the pieces of the puzzle together and nothing will seem to make sense. Some questions will be answered by the end of the season, but many of them will be left in the dark. The second season, entitled Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai, will answer the rest of the questions. It may seem like a pointless exercise, but fear not: even without knowing what heck is happening you will be drawn into the plot and every episode is involving enough to keep the entertainment value going.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art of When They Cry is its biggest flaw. Most of the art feels way too simplistic and monotone, even to the point where it is a bit of a turn-off. The visual appearance of the anime falls in contrast with its complex nature and the elaborate plot, which doesn\u2019t sit too well with most of the audience. It is not as bad as I make it out to be and fortunately the visuals keep well together during the more important and crucial parts. The art of the characters look particularly impressive and effective and their faces bear more expressiveness and emotion than what we are used to in anime.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s really no other way of find out whether this anime fits your taste other than to actually watch it. It is certainly entertaining and can get highly emotional at times, so it\u2019ll definitely hold on to you until the very end. Things can become quite gruesome and disturbing, so be ready for when that happens. Is it worth watching When They Cry? It is definitely worth watching and it is a unique experience that will remain with you for a very long time.\\n\\n\r\nWelcome to Hinamizawa. Enjoy your stay and beware of killer lolis.",

This season has a lot more frightening parts to it though. Both seasons are just as thrilling, but this one definately has more scary scenes. \r\nThe storyline is just as thrilling as everything else in the anime, though it's very easy to find spoilers for the series if you try to lookup what's going on, because it doesn't always make a lot of sense until you watch season two.\\n\r\nIt's a very clever storyline aswell. It keeps you interested through every second of it, and it was SO exciting that I finished both seasons in less then a weeks' time.\\n\r\nThere's very good humour in it too. I had a lot of laughs throughout the whole thing.\\n\r\nEverything was awesome about this anime, and it was so good that it's become one of my ultimate favorite animes. Though I didn't rate the art to be perfect, it is still very well drawn. I simply rated it that in relation to say Air, or Fullmetal Alchemist, because though the art is very good, it's just not as detailed.

            "content": "It kinda bothers me when an anime series will be tagged with things like \"psychological\" and \"thriller\" when it is neither. It makes me think there's going to be elaborate plans, shocking betrayals, a battle of wits, etc. Higurashi simply does not have these points. I would call it a mystery story, but don't watch it expecting it to really get you excited. \r\n- - - S T O R Y - - - \r\nIt kinda feels like an RPG. The way the characters met up to play games after school reminded me of how Will and his friends did the same in the SNESgame Illusion of Gaia. I know that's a pretty obscure reference, but it felt pretty nostalgic to me, and I liked that. \\n\r\nThis anime is RPG-like in another way, as well; the story changes depending on the main character's actions, and we are shown a few different versions of the story. This is kinda confusing at first, but it's okay after you accept that it is just like a retelling of the story in a parallel universe or something. \\n\\n\r\nIn the later half of the series, it elaborates on the previously told stories rather than retelling a new version. We get to see the other characters' perspectives, which adds to the overall story and reveals what's really happening. Now, I like this method of storytelling, but I don't think it went well with the \"parallel universe\" method. They only elborated on one timeline, leaving the others as pointless \"what if\" scenarios. They might as well have not bothered telling those different versions. \\n\r\nThey do incorporate it later in the story, making it seem as if the failed version was not entirely useless. It kinda works, but it kinda just feels like a mess. Instead of it being some big reveal, it's just something that can't make any logical sense. \\n\\n\r\n- - - A R T - - - \\n\r\nSome character art and some parts of the animation are, well, simply terrible. The girls look like babies and give a really bad first impression. Some of the adults are drawn decently, but a lot of them just look like anime teenagers, and many of them are as short as the kids. \\n\r\nThe animation is a terrible match with the voice acting at the \"intense\" moments, making it just look really cheap, poorly synced, and just not suitable. \\n\\n\r\n- - - S O U N D - - -\\n\r\nThe music didn't stand out to me like \"wow, I wanna listen to this song again\", but some of the songs that played did stand out to me a little. A lot of the time, I don't really notice when anime has music since it's just so generic and boring, but the music in this one caught my ear a little - enough for me to acknowledge that there was, indeed, music. \\n\r\nThe voice acting is okay. It seemed weird how these kids had such vicious voices at times, and the animation poorly conveyed it. It sounded kinda stupid when the characters had their \"insane\" laughter. \\n\\n\r\n- - - C H A R A C T E R S - - - \\n\r\nOverall, Shion was the only good character. She was just a lot more developed than the others and played a very active role, being involved with the story so much that she even became the master of her destiny. Her change of heart seemed a little uncalled for, though. She mainly accomplished what she wanted, though she failed to learn what she really wanted to know; there was no reason to go as far as she did. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters have their moments, but you can't say much about them since they're changing all the time. One mini-arc they're the nicest person in the wrld, next mini-arc they're the polar opposite. Keiichi played interesting roles, but I can't say he's a good character due to how drastically different the mini-arcs were. \\n\\n\r\n- - - O V E R A L L - - -\\n\r\nI was paying close attention to things as I watched, thinking that if I didn't, I'd have to rewatch the series for it to make sense. This anime is not that unforgiving, though; in the last mini-arc, I think they give enough hints and stuff that you can figure things out, such as the swamp disease; this must've been what was in that syringe. \\n\r\nThere are things that don't get solved or explained, though, like how Rena was possessed in the first arc, what really happened to Satoshi, what's up with the volcanic gases, or who the true culprit is. The stuff at the end is a little ambiguous, as if they wanted to make it seem like Keiichi was simply crazy and imagining things in the first mini-arc, but I think that'd be too much of a stretch. It's possible, but feels kinda cheap. \\n\\n\r\nI was worried the blood and violence was just there for the shock value or whatever. It mostly was, but they didn't forcibly overdo it, at least. \\n\\n\r\nHigurashi was fairly enjoyable overall, but I think they should have only chosen the \"parallel universe\" method or the \"alternate perspective\" method, not both. It's fine as a Scooby Doo kinda mystery, but it's certainly not a psychological thriller like Death Note. This was fun to watch, but there was nothing impressive about it.",

            "content": "Honestly one of the best stories I have ever seen in any media. \r\nThe story is about a mysterious event that happens in a small town called hinamizawa that would result in the death of every single person in the village. The strange thing is it is happening over and over again at the same time period. \r\nAs events unfold the show will leave you asking, WTF is happening in this place? \r\nThe show will confuse you with multiple possible explanation as to what is happening with different possible ways that would lead to the death of everyone. Each time everyone dies, more and moreof the story is explained with many red herrings added into the mix.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the story is finally explained in season 2 you realize how tragic and sad the story really is. As if the all the death and blood was not bad enough, the story reveals who the true victim is. \\n\\n\r\nThis may be a horror, mystery, and supernatural thriller, but it is also inspiring in its explanation of the word perseverance and the concept of an endless hell. It explores the meaning of hope in a very refined way and it warms the heart when their hard work finally pays off.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, this show made excellent use of materials to improve the story. They used blood and gore to intensify moments and to really show how terrible things are. The use of red herring is genius, misleading me who guesses story lines for breakfast. The use of lovable characters to show how nice everything is before everything collapses.\\n\\n\r\nI strongly recommend this show for those people that likes to think, mysteries, and battle of wits, and don't mind blood and gore, psycho moments, or being confused for an entire season.",

            "content": "\"Get Out! Get Out! GET OUT!!!\"\r\n-Keiichi in the Infamous Door Scene\r\nWatching Higurashi... was probably the the most terrifying experience I've ever gone through when it has come to anime. Anime in general is not considered to be a scary thing. We have animes like Elfen Lied, Hellsing and Another, and they're all classified as \"horror\", but none of them have really been able to make me hesitant before looking out my window at night. I don't know whether it was the creepy atmosphere, the gruesome deaths, or the sudden change of personalities in the characters. Either way, this anime was both horrifying to watch, butit was easily one of the greatest I've ever seen. Throughout this review, I will be giving no spoilers, but I will be explaining why you, your friends, your family, your children, and infants should watch this show. So let's get this review started.\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi no Kaku Koro Ni, or When the Cicadas Cry if you prefer the English title, is a story... well, multiple stories, about a boy named Keiichi Maebara who moves in to the small town of Hinamizawa. It's a quiet village, perfect if you want to get out of the city. The town has 1 festival a year, and that is the Cotton Drifting Festival. But, every year during this festival, a curse takes place. For the past few years, every night on the night of the festival, someone has died. Once Keiichi finds out about this, his best friends start acting a little... weird... Throughout this series, Keiichi's life is constantly in danger, and he's the only one that can uncover the truth about this string of murders. Over the course of 26 episodes there are different arcs that tell a different version of the story of the Curse of Oyashiro, each one with even more shocking content then the last. I found the story very unique and captivating, which was what I look for in animes.\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi was originally a visual novel, and an amateur one at that. The anime however was brought to you by the company Studio Deen, who was known for some other animes such as Dragon Crisis!, Fate/Stay Night, and Fruits Basket. I might mention that the artwork in Higurashi was a bit... odd, if that's the right word... the main characters (the ones that were all 16 or younger) seemed to have abnormally large heads, and  amazingly skinny arms and legs. It wasn't a bad thing though, it was interesting to watch an anime with an art style of it's own. Also, it's strange how something so disgustingly cute could turn into something so beautifully horrifying...\\n\\n\r\nI didn't recognize ANY of the voice actors in Higurashi. I did look them up afterwords to see if I actually knew any of them but had just forgotten any of their previous roles, but my suspicions were correct. I didn't know any of them. They could have all made their debut from this for all I know, but I liked all of them and I hope to hear more of their work in other animes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, oh Lord this is gonna be good... Higurashi had some of the best characters I've seen in any anime, which just strengthens my love for this series! Let's start off with Keiichi, the one male protagonist that I actually don't have any problems with at all. He's funny in the disgustingly cute scenes, and pure awesome in the beautifully horrifying scenes, my favorite being the Infamous Door Scene. Next is Rena, probably the most horrifying out of the bunch. I can say that I literally jumped out of my seat whenever she'd get that scary, demonic expression on her face whenever she'd ask \"Why are you lying to me?\". Horrifying, but beautiful at the same time. Then we have Mion and Shion. In this anime, either one of them could be Mion or Shion. It's just like Hikaru and Kaoru, there's not usually a surefire way of knowing which is which unless you've seen it before. Both have totally opposite personalities. One is the jock-like, super happy type. The other is the supposedly innocent type. Even though you'd think their personalities would give them away, you might find yourself surprised later on. Rika is next, and she was my favorite. Neepa! Enough said. Last is Satoko, which is probably the one girl I feel bad for the most in this series. It will be explained why I feel bad for her in the series, so no spoilers, but she's super cute and I'd love to have her as a sister. All of the characters were so brilliant, they were perfect. No complaints.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall score for this? 10/10. Some of you might make a mistake... and watch this during the afternoon. I do not recommend doing this. I recommend doing it at midnight or later to get the best experience. So, do I recommend this to people? Yes. I recommend it to those who love the Psychological genre, the Horror genre, the Action genre, all of them. Just watch this and love it like I did.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 10",

            "content": "I recommend not watching Higurashi no naku koro ni unless you plan on watching ALL of the 1st AND 2nd season (Higurashi no naku koro ni kai)! Without watching both, its like having the pieces of a puzzle and not knowing how they fit together, it wont make any sense\r\nOverall: 10/10\r\nI came across this series randomly, and I noticed that it had a very good average rating, so I decided to give it a whirl, now Im very glad that I found it. I really loved this series, though the first season is a little flawed, it still deserves a place in the greats. Everystory arc had its say in the odd collection of mysterious stories of psychopathic killing and death.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10 (1st season alone 10/10 when watched with 2nd season)\\n\r\nThis one of the things that gets me, unless you continue in the Higurashi series, the story in Higurashi no naku koro ni is very random and unexplainable, by itself, Higurashi no naku koro ni is a collection of different situations that all lead to killing and death... unfortunately they dont explain exactly why all the events occur, therefore there is pretty much a requirement to watch the 2nd season, Higurashi no naku koro ni kai, to understand everything. All the episodes are like pieces of a puzzle. Apart, they dont seem like anything that will awe you, hell, when you put together story arcs they even look like random yet interesting fillers, but once you have most the pieces of the puzzle, you can get the last pieces and put it together by watching the 2nd season, then from the seemingly random and pointless pieces, you put together an amazing picture that almost no other series can match.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nthe art is a little sketchy sometimes, especially when characters go insane, their faces are horribly contorted, and though it adds to the feeling that they are not normal anymore, the art still looks somewhat odd during those times. however, if you look past that, overall, the art is of good quality.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe opening is a pretty good tone setter for such a kind of anime, its a freaky kind of feeling that you get throughout the series. the BGM didnt bother me any, and it actually did a pretty good job at setting the mood. The sound effects however are quite good and plenty of splattering and crunching is to be heard from all the killing, pretty believable sounds of killing if I do say so myself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is one of Higurashi's strong points, whenever something horrible happens, they reveal what really happened later, which sheds much light onto the reasons as to why such acts are committed. it delves deep into the different psyches of the characters and reveals their pasts and their worries. You see clearly the reasons why they snap and go on murderous rampages...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI really loved this show, many times it delivered the kind of horror that you would feel only if a psychotic killer was after you, and other times, its like watching a slice of life anime, one thing is certain, the strange happenings in the little town of Hinamizawa are all interesting to watch, though you might need some mental strength because of the intense violence shown sometimes (disembowelment is shown once and torture a couple times). This is something you dont want to show kids, itll give them intense nightmares if they see certain parts of this...\\n\\n\r\nIve noticed that some random person gave Higurashi a bad score and claimed it was a harem and its just a bunch of fillers, hes only seen 5/50 episodes of Higurashi and has only seen a very small (and I mean VERY small) fraction of the full perspective of the situation in Hinamizawa, and its DEFINITELY NOT a harem, its a very bloody story about friendship and trust. Watch it all the way through and watch the 2nd season as well to fit the pieces together, then you will really know why so many people like Higurashi.",

Maybe if When they Cry didn't have so many boring episodes, then I would watch the entire thing.\\n\\n\r\nWhen they Cry should have chosen one genre instead of trying to implement two completely different ones. If this anime dived into the story a little bit quicker and threw away the 30 minute cute stuff, then maybe I would have enjoyed this show a LOT MORE.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this show does NOT do that...therefore I hate this show and I do not recommend it to anyone.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni was an anime that I was extremely skeptical about watching. But, all of the reviews I had seen made it seem like an interesting anime that I would enjoy. In reality, Higurashi turned out to be an awesome story with really nice themes of friendship and helping others underneath the gruesome first appearance. The story was extremely interesting but at the beginning it was a little confusing, since the story revolves around arcs which are then reset.  \r\n  On the surface the story focuses on a group of friends, Keiichi, Rena, Rika, Mion, and Satoko and the smalltown they live in. The first arc is mainly used to set up the story and get the mystery rolling, and it did its job extremely well. As the arcs continued and I got to see different viewpoints of similar stories I couldn't stop watching! \\n\r\nBesides the story being great, the characters were also really nicely developed and they each had an interesting life/ back story that was presented throughout the season. The characters and the backgrounds were all drawn to give the show a kind of lighthearted appearance which I thought was a nice touch since it made the plot seem to stand out more. I watched some of the English dub, but I mainly watch the Japanese dub because I felt that the Japanese voice actors caught the characters better than the English voice actors did. So I would recommend watching this show in Japanese.\\n\r\n  I honestly loved Higurashi and I thought it was highly enjoyable and interesting to watch. The end of the first season left me wanting more, which was great because the second season is available. The horror or violence aspect of the show may draw you in but the story is truly interesting and the mystery kept me guessing most of the show, so I highly recommend watching Higurashi no Naku Koro ni if you are a mystery or horror fan.",

            "content": "Okey, this is my first review on this site so I'll do my best but I'm not an expert on reviews so you have been warned.\r\nLet me start by saying this: Higurashi is a work of pure genius. In terms of the story I don't think there really is another anime series that can even compare to it. Higurashi is extremely original, all the characters are genuine, unlike many horror/drama animes it actually HAS something else to offer other than violence and gore.  It's filled with all the elements a good anime must have in order to become succesful; even the music is perfectlycomposed. \\n\\n\r\nI don't really remember a time when an anime had me so immersed. Higurashi will show you a world of mistery, drama, sorrow and leave you wanting more. The story's power is compelling and at times it will make you cry. I guess, watching this anime is just like being there and experiencing all those moments, be they good or bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters (Keiichi, Rena, Mion, Rika, Satoko) have immense depth, and their life stories are jaw-dropping. Basically, the story follows a teenage boy Maebara Keiichi and his small band of friends in a tiny village of Hinamizawa. It's a small peaceful place with a loving atmosphere, where all the villagers help each other and every day is filled with happines and joy. But then the story makes a 180 degree turn and Keiichi brutaly murders two of his best friends and commits suicide. From then on a chain reaction is triggered and tragedy after tragedy occurs. \"Why? why!? Why did it happen?? What is going on!?\" are the questions that probably everyone who watched this series asked themselves. And this is the reason why YOU, the reader of this review must find out. The anime will slowly give you the answers but beware, there are more and more twists and turns on the way. \\n\\n\r\nAnd when you finally find out the truth... you'll be left speechless.",

            "content": "It's no secret that Japan loves making series about cute things, especially girls. Most series about cute girls focus on having its main characters doing cute things just to fill out an episode, but every once in a while an anomaly arrives. This series is wonderfully twisted, and despite its initial appearance it offers a compelling murder mystery and some excellent insight into its characters as they are slowly broken down. It is fascinating to watch each character as they are slowly backed into a corner and their thoughts turn from rational to irrational, this series is one that appears to be yet another typicalcutesy harem but quickly shows its true colors as something much more enticing.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off fairly similar to a horror/mystery narrative, with \\n\r\nKeiichi a city boy moving to an rural village that appears to be hiding some secrets from its past, in particular murder. At first the story starts off as appearing to be a school slice of life with some harmless play between friends, but surely but slowly more and more sinister details begin to build up and do a great job of building tension and mystery to the story at the same time. Another interesting note is that the series does not follow a linear story line, as being adopted from a visual novel it instead shows the same day over and over. This could have easily been botched on make the series fell dull, but each story follows another main character and shows just exactly how they managed to slip so far out of touch with their sanity, and each perspective offers new clues and mysteries to the narrative, so it never feels repetitive or filler esque. \\n\\n\r\nThey all start very similarly however, each will start with a slice of life segment before meticulously working towards breaking its character, but the events that transpire in each timeline are so twisted and suspenseful that its hard to tear your eyes away from the screen, similar to how people can't but watch when there's a disaster on the television. The outcome of each particular timeline is usually known, so the series heavily relied on its execution to keep you watching, and it does indeed showcase some dark content and lots of blood, there are a lot of sequences in this series that will make your skin crawl, and I haven't felt such a sensation since when I watched Elfen Lied. I also enjoyed how the series leaves the source of the main mystery ope throughout its run, as its difficult to pick out what is causing all of this insanity in such a little town, and the writers do a great job not dismissing any possibility from aliens to the supernatural, and it legitimately feels like each is a legitimate possibility. However, if you do want answers to most of the questions that are posed in this series, you'll have to be in it for the long run as they are answered in the 24 episode second season. This makes this series a 50 episode investment, which is something to weigh when deciding if this series is right for you.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime really shines when it showcases its characters at their darkest moments in their respective arcs, as you see how they are slowly are beginning to unravel with each event until they reach their breaking point, with delightfully wonderful results. This anime plays deeply with the psychology of its character, and sometimes it is difficult to trust the narrator of the arc as you can see that they are clearly are no longer thinking rationally, which adds more to the suspense of the series as the characters rush to find that the dead have apparently left their graves or interpret every action of their friends as a threat. The trademark pan onto a character's face followed by a screeching soundtrack is employed heavily in this series, and surprisingly helps add to the atmosphere instead of making it appear cheesy. The art is definitely dated at this point, and is alright at best, its nothing spectacular but its not horrible either.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a compelling mystery and psychological anime that offers a lot more than initially expected from its cover and first episode. It strays from a linear story line and is still able to provide a beautifully twisted yet compelling story, and has a large cast of characters that is able to develop throughout the course of the show by slowly breaking them down. This series is definitely not one to show the kids, and is a series that any fan of psychological or mystery anime should give a try.",

            "content": "Higurashi is a little bit of genius. I personally loved every moment of it. It was enthralling, terrifying, and made me want to laugh like a psychotic idiot. All in all, this anime was completely amazing. Let me start.\r\nStory~\r\nIf it weren't for the first 30 seconds of episode one (and also the opening theme song) one might think this is a romance anime. However, if they continue watching, they'll find quite the opposite. It's an intriguing mystery horror series, where everyone goes insane at some point or another and ends up slaughtering all their friends.\r\nPersonally, this series was quite fun for me to watch. Callme crazy, but I enjoyed watching the characters slowly fall into the Pit of Insanity. There is a lot of blood and the like in this show, and a lot of it might disturb you. If it does, you might not want to watch Higurashi. \\n\r\nAnyway, the story centers around these characters. It's also a sort of \"What if\" story. Whenever one of the characters dies, it starts all over again-- or so you think. Actually, this whole show is just a big thing of \"what if\"-- such as, \"What would happen if Keiichi did this?\" And then, when they ask that question, the series gives an arc of episodes to portray what would happen, if Keiichi (or one of the other characters) did that. The process repeats over and over again. It sounds awful, but each episode is thrilling, and adds a piece onto the glorious mystery of this show.\\n\r\nAll in all, it's just amazing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt~\\n\r\nHonestly, this is where Higurashi takes a downfall. Don't get me wrong, I adore the character design, but the movement isn't all that good. Sometimes it is, as sometimes it isn't. I suppose that the gore scenes or other enjoyable scenes just didn't move as fluidly as I wished them too, and the choppiness sorta...ruined it. However, the art style itself is very good, and I love how they draw the characters, especially when they've lost their minds. Sometimes the movement was amazing, adding perfectly to the scene, but other times it was just average.\\n\r\nI won't dock the overall grade of the show on movement, though. All in all, it doesn't take anything away from the show just by being *occasionally* choppy here and there, so it's good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound~\\n\r\nI liked the voices in both English and Japanese, but to tell you the truth, the Japanese voices are slightly better. (It's just a matter of opinion though.) The opening and ending soundtracks are perfect, and no matter what the incoming episode may be about, the opening song always perfectly sets the mood. That haunting melody with that echoing, ethereal voice in the background... trust me, there hasn't been a better song for a horror series.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in the actual scenes isn't really soundtrack, more of a collection of sounds to form a weak, faint melody of sorts. Is this bad? HECK NO. The instruments used at those terrifying scenes are just perfect. If they actually had a real melody, an actual song going, it might actually take away from the mood. But what they've done in Higurashi is splendid-- not really trying to add in songs, but just enhancing the current scene, building suspense when it's needed.\\n\r\nThere are regular soundtracks though, and trust me, each one goes perfectly with the scene it's played in.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter~\\n\r\nAlthough this show has an amazing plot line, it also boasts the best of characters. They fit in perfectly with the show, and although they all end up insane at some point, they're all their own characters. None of them are ever the same, and each one turns psychotic for their own reasons, and in their own ways. I love the character development too. In each arc it just gets better and better.\\n\r\nNot to mention, it's amazing to see a happy, cute girl one moment, then a raving murderer the next. All in all, this show is a thrill, and I couldn't help but laugh psychotically when the characters lost their sanity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Higurashi isn't everyone's flavor of candy. However, if you like this sort of thing, it's definitely worth a look. Heck, it's more than worth a look, you need to check this out. Even if you don't like shows such as this one, you still might want to give it a try anyway, just to be sure. Trust me, it's an amazing show, and although you may just be watching it to watch it, there is so much more behind the story... an engaging mystery, if you'd like to try and piece it together yourself. If not, just sit back and enjoy this disturbingly engrossing story.",

After watching the first four episodes, the title was practically burned into my memory. By the time I finished the series, it had become a personaly favorite of mine. It is definitely one of the best psychological/horror anime I have seen.\r\n*If you do not like violent anime, you may want to stay away from this one. There is a lot of gruesome scenes. Don't let the cute faces fool you*\r\nThe characterdevelopment, the way they accurately portray each characters' fall into paranoia and madness, is brilliant and highly entertaining. The characters are awesome, each one with their own unique personality. The art/animation was alright. The music fit the mood greatly, and the OP is awesome.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing people seem to have trouble with is the way the show is arranged. They complain about being confused because of how the show resets after each story arc. It's alright if you are confused, because you're supposed to keep asking yourself . . . what exactly is going on in Hinamizawa? O.o The mystery is part of what makes this series so great\\n\\n\r\nThe sequel, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai, will give you all the answers you seek.

            "content": "{NOTES-This review covers both the first season and Kai as I don\u2019t see a reason to write 2 separate review for 2 halves of the same story. Also, this review does contain minor spoilers for episodes 1-4 of the first season, this is because I need to discuss the methods of storytelling in order to fully evaluate this series on its narrative quality. If you don\u2019t want to be spoiled you don\u2019t have to read, simple as that :)}\r\nIf you knew me well enough then you would know that I love murder mystery. Many an evening I have spent on my sofa watching reruns ofCSI, Agatha Christie\u2019s Poirot, Columbo and many other series. I am also a big fan of psychological thrillers like the films of Charlie Kaufman and Alfred Hitchcock. What draws me to these stories is difficult to describe. Perhaps it is the excitement of watching a complex set of seemingly unconnected events slowly shift into place like a seismic jigsaw, or the exploration of the mental states of damaged and deranged characters and what led them to this behavior, or maybe it's the gripping tension and fright that often accompanies these frequently grim and disturbing tales. With this said, you can probably deduce why I was drawn to today\u2019s subject: Higurashi no naku koro ni/Kai. Based on the popular visual novel series, Higurashi was adapted into anime in two seasons which aired between 2006 and 2007. It is famous for its infamous gore and unconventional storytelling methods. After finishing the series, I am convinced that it has been misrepresented by the people who sell it on these points alone. I was slightly hesitant going in that the series might turn out to just be a gorefest with a weakly defined mystery aspect, but I found myself pleasantly surprised\u2026\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory- Higurashi is a supernatural mystery thriller series set in a small village called Hinamizawa. The series is structured by means of various arcs that each tell a different story about the people of the village. Ok, sounds simple so far doesn\u2019t it? Well the fact is these stories aren\u2019t random or trivial and they\u2019re certainly not very lighthearted. Most of the arcs end with some kind of tragic event in which something happens to the characters or town and involve mental instability and often murder. The twist is that after this happens, instead of moving the story on from there, Higurashi resets the clock and plays out a different set of events because the whole show is set in a time loop. Each of these scenarios teaches you a bit more about the town, its inhabitants and the tragic events that keep occurring each time. You see Higurashi is a master of a little thing called perspective. There is no real main character, at least not a constant one. The perspective shifts between various characters throughout the show to give you clues about character motivations and the truth behind certain events.\\n\\n\r\nIts this bizarre method of moving along the story that gives Higurashi a unique edge among mystery shows, being more comparable to something more avant garde like Twin peaks or The prisoner than a standard murder mystery. The mystery aspect is by far one of the best aspects of the show, it has you totally confused but also totally hooked to find out what all the answers are as well as see the characters work out how to stop the tragedies. The show dangles the carrot to an almost ridiculous degree at some points, giving you no context to bizarre events and raising 5 times as many questions as it answers though I would argue this is part of the fun. This is not a cheap mystery drama where the conclusion can be guessed half way through, you have to think and pay attention to even keep track of some events.\\n\\n\r\nEach story arc is well paced and very intense, they all build up a heavy atmosphere of impending disaster and visibly show the mental states of the characters slowly fall into a state of despair by subtle dialogue exchanges and visual symbolism. The plot always starts unassumingly but slowly descends into darker territories but this change in mood is done so subtly and atmospherically that it adds a great deal of tension and foreboding. Though 90% of the show is dialogue and atmosphere, nothing ever feels boring or pointless as every conversation serves to build character, atmosphere or offer clues. \\n\r\nThe other 10% however is what everyone remembers and that\u2019s the gorier scenes. Yes, there are lots of gory scenes but they are not as frequent or intense as people say. In fact, often the show goes out of its way to directly show anything too horrific, we mainly see character reactions and brief glimpses of horrible images. This works to the show\u2019s favour as these images are more effective when less is shown and more is implied. Also, these scenes do not come out of nowhere. They are the emotional and narrative climax to each story arc, which has built them up over many layers of foreshadowing and tension. \\n\\n\r\nBetween all the mind boggling mystery and gory mess though, Higurashi is also a series with a lot of emotional and thematic poignancy. The descent of the characters into madness and despair is often heartbreaking to watch, especially because most of the tragedy is based on a mixture of character flaws and unfortunate events which lead the characters over the edge. Every time the story resets, especially near the end of the series you want to see the characters prevail over the tragedies and get back to their peaceful lives that the beginning of each arc gives you a glimpse of. As the plot and mystery unfolds, the show also raises a lot of interesting questions and explores a wide variety of themes and conflicts. Besides some messages about forgiveness, friendship and perseverance, Higurashi also comments on fate, various mental conditions, political corruption, scientific ethics, community, child abuse and God. These issues are not often addressed directly but rather are implemented into the stories of various characters so that they don\u2019t distract from the main conflict of the show. \\n\\n\r\nNow, because of my inner critic\u2019s solemn oath, I must admit that the story is not perfect. Not all the questions that are raised throughout the series are answered. Some plot threads which I assume were addressed in the visual novel or spin offs have been left out of this adaptation or not given enough explanation to make sense. I personally didn\u2019t find this too bad, it's good not to be handed every answer on a silver platter and have to make some inferences to fully get the gist of what\u2019s going on. With this said, there were a few things that I thought could have been given some more time and explanation to increase the drama of some of the reveals. There is also issues with scientific accuracy, some of the phenomena are not explained properly which may bum out people who crave total realism in whatever they watch. Finally, the transition between arcs can be somewhat tonally jarring. You witness the tragic train crash of a conclusion of one story only to be pulled over to a parallel line of carefree days in the village. Granted, you get used to this after a while but it is kind of weird in the first 10 or so episodes.\\n\\n\r\nDespite these flaws however, I have no problem calling Higurashi one of the best mystery/thriller series I have ever sat all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nStory 9.5/10 \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- The characters of Higurashi are like a surrealist fruit bowl, incredibly varied and all different flavours of crazy. Ok, maybe that was a little bit of an insensitive way to put it but seriously, they\u2019re all really fucked up, like i\u2019m talking Evangelion fucked up here.  Every character is essentially a ticking time bomb, in each story a different fuse is pulled and one of them succumbs to some kind of intense mental breakdown. Whether it is Keiichi, who suffers from paranoia and hallucinations, Shion, who is traumatised by her upbringing and the disappearance of her love interest before the start of the story or Satoko, who has had such a rough deal in life that you will just want to hug her by the end of the series. \\n\\n\r\nEvery character is like an enigma wrapped in a twinkie wrapped in 10 layers of more confusing behaviour and foreshadowing than a David Lynch movie. When you first meet the characters, they display fairly normal personalities and behaviours. But once things take a turn for the worse, their seemingly ordinary temperaments are revealed to be nothing more than masks that drop to floor covered in blood, revealing their true colours. If this was the extent of the characterization however, it would not be nearly as effective as it is as the show would have merely pulled the proverbial rug out from under your unsuspecting feet without any real drama of connection. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout every arc, information continues to be revealed about each character which makes you question everything you thought you knew about them. While they may have seemed to be a weak mental wreck in one story, in the next they seem to be a strong survivor who seeks to stop the impending tragedy. There are also no real villains, everyone is a victim. Despite the fact that this is a series where most everyone commits horrific acts of violence, the series goes out of its way to show you how these people got to this point and how it's honestly surprising they didn\u2019t snap long beforehand. The decisions that each character makes in each story is often different, sometimes they subconsciously learn from their mistakes in previous worlds and sometimes they just succumb to the same craziness that they did before. What makes the characters of Higurashi so great is that they aren\u2019t mere machines of the plot, as one character in particular learns, they have the power to influence the tragic events and change fate rather than be the victims in some schlocky horror story that kills people just to jerk undeserved tears. \\n\\n\r\nTo pick standout characters is like asking me to pick my favorite Doctor who, I like them all for different reasons. Rika Furude is one of the most intriguing characters of the series, remaining a complete puzzle box for the majority of the series, her true internal conflict is revealed near the end and by Oyashiro is it some truly intense stuff. Another standout character is Takano Miyo, whose backstory and character arc is so very heartbreaking but saying anymore would be major, major spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time we reach the end of the story, we know all we need to know about these characters. We know their strengths, their weaknesses, their masks, their true nature, their past and how it influences them, their motivations and most importantly we have seen them grow, learn and change. That, my friends is what all great stories should aim to do, not many can do it to this caliber.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9.7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt- The art style of Higurashi is rather minimalist. The character designs are thin and not particularly detailed, with a definite moe influence(as Higurashi was inspired by the works of Key). Though this was clearly a stylistic choice, it is also clear that this show was on a budget, and quite a small one at that. Often the characters look more like mannequins than people which, in the more disturbing scenes, actually adds to the horror on screen. But, sometimes the designs just look a bit too lifeless or disconnected from what we know as people. So, while it works for the horrific scenes, it can also subtract from the drama and emotion that the show is trying to transmit. This is somewhat remedied in the second season, where the designs are given more flair and detail but the point still stands for the first season.\\n\\n\r\nIt is also clear that the animation for the first season wasn\u2019t the best it could be, especially after you compare it to other titles from 2006. The reason for the clever camera tricks and use of atmosphere I mentioned earlier was probably because of budget reasons as well as an artistic choice. Often during the show, there are still shots of characters talking from a distance or repeated stock shots of the village to save on animation budget. Once again, this can also add to the atmosphere and it's admirable that they were able to turn a limitation into a tool to build atmosphere but once again it is technically a flaw and it is occasionally distracting from the experience.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that is worth mentioning in a positive light though is the design of the environments, specifically the village. Based on the real life mountain village of Shirakawa-go, Hinamizawa feels like a real town. Over the course of the series, you come to know certain landmarks and places that serve as the backdrop to important scenes. The many atmospheric shots I previously mentioned are used to give the viewer a feel of the village itself and its people. We often see Hinamizawa either in the evening or at night and the show makes fantastic use of lighting to build mood in the environments. The colour scheme is a mixture of murky oranges, lush greens and other rural shades. Another final thing worth mentioning is the animation in the openings which presents the viewer with lots of abstract images and symbolism which slowly reveals its meaning as you watch the show. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7.0/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound- The music of Higurashi is\u2026 well it's just\u2026 creepy. A lot of it makes me think i\u2019m in the Shadow temple from Ocarina of time. Menacing drums beats, heavy drones, ominous choirs and pretty much every other horror sounding instrument imaginable. Some of the sounds aren\u2019t even recognizable as instruments like the weird twisting noises and low humming. Something about it just makes your skin crawl(Could it be?) Most of the songs aren\u2019t really songs, rather just 1 minute of what sounds like an intro to something bigger. And when you think about it, that\u2019s exactly what this whole show is about so it definitely works. One of the songs worth mentioning is the \u2018Main theme\u2019, a haunting piano piece with some creepy non-linguistic singing over the top that displays both sadness and fear, things that this anime has no short supply of. Because of this, the soundtrack isn\u2019t too effective when listened to on its own but I think that\u2019s the point, it exists to compliment the show. \\n\\n\r\nThere are 2 opening songs used over the 2 seasons. The first season\u2019s opening, titled \u2018Higurashi no naku koro ni\u2019, is an ominous techno song with some disturbing lyrics and a driving, syncopated beat that makes you feel slightly uneasy.The second season opening, \u2018Naraku no hana(Flower in hell)\u2019, is a more melodic and hopeful song that I found myself singing along to by the end of the series. The ending themes are also quite nice. The first is a semi-whispered \u2018engrish\u2019 song that has quite a nice tune and piano accompaniment. The second ending however is a slightly jazzy number with some nice vocals, this time all in Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as voice acting goes, I only watched the sub because I was told that the dub is the worst thing since the Elfen Lied dub so I steered clear of it. If there\u2019s one thing I can say about the cast of this show it's that they have some incredible range and flexibility. Yukari Tamura is able to balance Rika\u2019s many shades and depths naturally to an almost scary degree. Mai Nakahara is able to make Rena cute and fluffy one moment and borderline schizoid the next and Miki Ito\u2019s portrayal of Takano is chilling in its intensity at points. Other notable standouts include Chafurin as the tough, seasoned cop Ooishi and Satsuki Yukino playing both of the Sonozaki twins, now that takes talent. Overall, the cast are excellent and are the magic that brings the characters to life, and to the edge of insanity\u2026\\n\\n\r\nSound 9.0/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Ah, the section I always have trouble talking about, I mean how do I effectively judge enjoyment? This show is a prime example of my difficulty with this category because no 2 shows are enjoyable for the same reasons and in the same way. 90% of this show is dialogue and atmosphere, preparing you for the more intense scenes. If you watch it for they gory bits alone, you won\u2019t be able to get the most out of its brilliant mystery and thriller aspects. It requires a certain type of mindset, like a mad scientist or detective looking for clues amongst the rubble. The draw of this show at first is looking for all the clues, picking up on the foreshadowing and trying to make sense of the seemingly random events. But, as the show goes on and the secrets unravel you start to care for the characters and want to see them escape the tragic events that befall them. Higurashi becomes an effective and engaging drama as well as a mystery mindfuck. It is this slow transition and duality that gives the show its edge among others of its kind. If you want something intense, confusing, mysterious, engaging, deep and emotional then I have no doubt that you will enjoy this series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9.0\\n\r\nConclusion- Higurashi is an excellent supernatural mystery series. It presents its story in an interesting manner, provides a lot of good mysteries, creates some highly complex characters and does this all while creating a thick, impending mood. It has its hiccups, unanswered questions and shoddy animation but these can work to its advantage in places. Its an interesting puzzle box study of severely messed up but still good at heart people. A highly thrilling experience if you\u2019re paying attention\u2026\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nONS(Overall narrative score, Story+Characters+Enjoyment/2)=9.4\\n\r\nOAS(Overall aesthetic score, Art+Sound/2)=8.0\\n\r\nOFS(Overall final score, average of all categories)=8.8\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading guys n gals, my next review will probably be on Blast of tempest :)",

            "content": "Setting & Plot\r\nHigurashi No Naku Koroni mainly takes place in the (seemingly) peaceful and idyllic town (or rather, village) of Hinamizawa.\r\nImportant to note is that the series does not have a single, clear storyline - instead, the series is divided into different \"chapters\" that each share the same setting and characters, yet all have a different storyline, with the exception of two; The Meakashi chapter has the same storyline as the Watanagashi chapter, but tells the events from a different person's point of view, answering many questions that remained after the Watanagashi chapter.\r\nSimilarities between all of the storylines include the Shrine God's Curse, the mysteriousmurder chain connected to it and the fact that a chapter usually ends with the deaths of several of the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nOn to the characters. The characters are very important in this series, as it mainly focuses on the relationships between the characters and the results of those. I'll make a small list of the most important characters here:\\n\r\nMaebara Keiichi: The only male main character. At the beginning of each chapter, he only just moved to Hinamizawa and is still in the process of getting to know everyone and everything - including the Shrine God's Curse and the mysterious chain of murders connected to it.\\n\r\nRyuuguu Rena: The cute girl with the axe. Yeah, laugh. She's always shown with it in the OP, but she barely ever has it with her. Other than that, she's just a friend of Keiichi's, and it seems like she is the one closest to him.\\n\r\nSonozaki Mion: Another friend of Keiichi's. She's the leader of the \"club\" all of them are members of, and she knows how to act like it. Other than that? Not much to say that wouldn't spoil a few things.\\n\r\nFurude Rika: My favourite character. That is because she's so mysterious, but she knows how to hide it. She's a few years younger than Keiichi, Rena and Mion, as well as the sole survivor of the Furude family, the family responsible for the village's Shrine. She also lives together with Houjou Satoko and is her best friend.\\n\r\nHoujou Satoko: She lives alone together with Rika. Her parents died and her brother, Satoshi, disappeared, all as results of the Shrine God's Curse. Not much to say about her that wouldn't spoil things.\\n\\n\r\nConfused?\\n\\n\r\nBelieve, this series CAN and WILL confuse you. Many of the events that form a part of the main storyline that takes place BEFORE the events of each chapter are only partially explained in each chapter; also, some events happening during the individual chapters can only be explained with information from another chapter. The best example is the Watanagashi and Meakashi chapters. Meakashi follows the same storyline Watanagashi does, yet they are told from the views of two different characters, so that many questions remaining after the Watanagashi chapter are only answered in Meakashi. A perfect example for that is the scene at the beginning of the Watanagashi chapter. The next time you see this scene is late in the Meakashi chapter, and there, it is explained what happened, why it happened and how it happened. Interesting.\\n\r\nHowever, to fully understand the whole series, you will need to watch Kai. But to understand Kai, you will need to watch the whole original series first.\\n\\n\r\nStyle\\n\\n\r\nEven though Higurashi No Naku Koroni might seem like a slice of life/comedy series at first glance, do not be fooled! Behind that facade hides a complicated story, with many confusing and disturbing twists and scenes. Many are quite bloody, so kids shouldn't watch this. There are funny scenes, but those are usually at the beginning of a chapter, to introduce you to the new setup.\\n\\n\r\nSummary\\n\\n\r\nAn anime you should watch, especially if you're a fan of mystery stuff. I really liked it, especially Kai. But Kai will be the object of another review.\\n\r\nOverall, I'd rate this show 9/10, but it gets 0,5 epicness points for having an epic OP, so it amounts to 9,5/10",

            "content": "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, also known in English as When They Cry, is possibly one of the masterpieces of the cute girls doing cute things genre of anime, although it does add in one male protagonist. This show is also one of the funniest out there, as multiple scenes had me totally laughing more than I had expected going into it. \r\nThe story revolves around 4 girls\u2014Mion, Rena, Satoko, and Rika\u2014and their male friend Keiichi, residents of the tiny village of Hinamizawa and students of varying grades at the small local school. Throughout the show, we get to better know these characters and watchtheir after-school club activities, one example being their super cute water gun fight, and also the classic test of courage scenes common in these anime like going into a locked building filled with medieval torture devices. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the cutest scenes tho are when people are brutally murdered, and I believe these to be some of the most moe scenes in all of anime.",

The impact of the blood and gore is blurred only slightly by the confusion in trying to follow the plot.\r\nStory. 8/10\r\nAfter only seeing around 7 episodes, you may decide the plot is, well, nonexistent, or that it doesn't make any sense. However, if you keep watching, you'll start to see that where the first \"chapter\" creates many holes in the plot line, these holes are filled chapter by chapter, leaving you with a sense of \"Ah, so that's what happened!\" And while it doesn't seem to come to a complete end,keep in mind that it's the prequel to many different Higurashi chapters. \\n\\n\r\nArt.  7/10\\n\r\nThe style is pretty unique, with characters not too in depth or distractingly beautiful. Strong emotions such as rage show the quality of the art at its best. The town of Hinamizawa is drawn well, and looks pretty realistic.\\n\\n\r\nSound. 7/10\\n\r\nThe scenes of graphic violence in this series are accompanied by the wonderful grunts, screams, or tortured silence of the victims with almost stunning accuracy. I wonder how they did their research?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter. 5/10\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw in this series is the character design. The main focus of this anime is Hinamizawa and its history. There's a little detail about each character, but just enough. Maybe there's more in the sequel?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. 8/10\\n\r\nHigurashi no naku koro ni is one of those anime that has a lot of \"wtf\" moments, and you'll probably start off the series being very confused and have suffered mild emotional scarring, but if you keep watching, it all comes together, and you may find that you end up feeling warm and fuzzy inside, after you've put all the pieces together.\\n\\n\r\nOverall. 7/10\\n\r\nFor some people the pure violence of Higurashi is enough to make them bow at  STUDIO DEEN's feet, and for others the confusion is enough to surpass the gore and make them drop the anime altogether. Lovers of this genre know you've gotta stick it out to the end and it'll all come to a close.",

            "content": "Imagine that since you born, you've been living a happy, calm life, filled with tranquility. You live in a small town where the everyone lives peacefully. Your school is great, and you're always surrounded by young, cute girls. Ahhh... That's the perfect life, right? If that's the case, imagine that, overnight, everything started to go terribly, terribly wrong, and everyone around you becomes either psychotic or insane... Or both. Suddenly, your whole life was brought to hell.\r\nThis, my friend, is pretty much how Higurashi feels.\r\nIt's a fantastic mystery series, in which the plot is presented in a way that makes you feel like you're watchingeverything right next to the characters, but the series also gives you the feeling that you are a mere investigator, gathering clues to solve an enourmous and complicated case. It's like a game, the only difference is that you have to play entirely in your mind. That's beacause Higurashi's plot is so brlliant and clever, that every time you watch and episode (or at least some of them), you take a few minutes to sort everything in your head, and try to come up with a sollution, or theory, that explains why a bunch of cute and mo\u00e9 teens are slaughtering each other all of a sudden. And each episode will either clarify some points, or just expand the mystery even more. Higurashi carries out all of this in an unique way that will keep you hooked.\\n\\n\r\nBut let's not forget the horror part of the show, which is also brilliantly carried out, and helps to give Higurashi an atmosphere of despair, doom and lost hope. It makes you desperate, and will only encourage you to keep watching, because you just want to see the characters solve things out, and live happily again. This is what encourages the viewer to solve the mystery even more. You want to save the main characters from that hell of a life.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, this series may not attract everyone, especially sensitive ones. But if you like a nice, mind-bending mystery, with great art, music, voices and characters that only make the show more interesting, then give Higurashi a try. It's one hell of a ride, in a great way.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 10/10",

            "content": "Transfer student Keniichi Maebara has grown a liking to his new town, the quiet village Hinamizawa. He becomes fast friends with four girls around his age. Although the town appears to be quite the humble place, it contains deadly secrets that can and does affect people's lives. -summary\r\nWhen They Cry is a series that surprised me upon my initial viewing, and I will admit that when I first saw it years ago my expectations were terribly low due to its stylistic similarities to Elfen Lied. One thing among many that Elfen Lied did terribly was the meshing of its genres. The comedy clashed with theviolent content and the fan service clashed with the horror. Therefore in the end, I couldn't take any of it seriously. This anime doesn't suffer from that tonal whiplash.\\n\\n\r\nWhen They Cry is superior to EL in every way by balancing its features. The comedy is well paced and it isn't presented to \"lighten up\" the mood. The comedy normally takes place in the beginning of an arc, and it actually works into the characters three dimensional development. It's meant to establish the kid's innocence and care free nature. This form of development may not be the best, but it did make the characters fun to watch on some occasions. However, when things become serious, this anime maintains the right tempo through well paced suspense, story build up, and definitely mystery.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot follows a group of friends as they find themselves falling victim to their town's curse, in which a person dies and another disappears during a festival that takes place each year. Some of them don't believe in it despite weird occurrences taking place; while others are convinced to the point of obsession and paranoia.\\n\\n\r\nThe meat of the series for me has to be the story and plot. The anime is broken up into six chapters using a horror-mystery backdrop. This is where the series takes some getting use to. At first, it utilizes a repetitive story and plot elements that becomes quite predictable. Normally, I hate this method of storytelling, but it actually works here for several reasons: For one, the stories continue to add background and present different, in-depth perspectives to the character's backgrounds and motives. Second, the stories are just plain interesting with the focus being on different individuals. Finally, the ending ties up everything making sense of it all in the process, and believe me, the ending is very strong because things feel quite weird nearly throughout the entire trip. \\n\\n\r\nThe series tells its tale by exploring the myths surrounding the villages history and traditions. I found the anime to be gripping once the plots began, and I believe the horror elements worked out rather well. The anime did a great job exercising its themes such as paranoia, deceit, manipulation, revenge, and obsession. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the elements that most fans mention about the series is the violence. The violence in the series can be very over the top, but it doesn't take place to carry or mask an incoherent plot. It also isn't used as a cheap and repetitive gimmick like a certain title out there. The violence is meant to shock the viewer, and I do believe it's effective along with supporting its themes. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters will work for some folks, but at times they were too saccharine for my taste. I understand the reasons for combining cute with violent. Still, this is an approach that can spell disaster for some, and I found a couple of the characters detestable on certain occasions. Overall, they are well developed and actually benefit the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe series does a great job handling its soundtrack and sound effects. The sounds of the cicadas adds to the series atmosphere creating a sense of ambiance when it's needed. The soundtrack also works well making the drama and even the horror stand out a tad bit more. Although my feelings are slightly mixed here; I enjoyed the artwork concerning the beautiful backgrounds but the character designs really didn't do a thing for me. The animation really wasn't anything special either. However, I must give props to the violence, when someone is getting smashed to pulp with a pipe, it can be quite disturbing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, When They Cry is definitely something hardcore anime fans should see. I think the series did its job in delivering a gripping experience. Some people think multiple watches are needed to fully get the story but I disagree there; the twists are nothing very special and a single viewing should be enough, yet I do think the ending is one of those \"wow\" moments. Personally, I don't think it's the masterpiece some may consider it. I didn't find the comedy funny in the least, and I do think the characters could have been developed differently. In any case, the only people I would advise against watching this are those whom despise this type of style. If you need 100% serious, tonal consistency with adult character designs in your anime, then it would be a very good move to skip this.\\n\\n\r\nHighs: Well use of horror elements, becomes more focused later\\n\\n\r\nLows: Unfunny comedy, style will completely put of certain types of anime fans",

Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni is one of few anime&rsquo;s that are able to put you into the mind of a killer; in fact, you often cannot tell what is simply a delusion and what is really happening. \r\nThe story does not really have a main character; this is due to the story being told in arcs, each from a different characters point of view. However,the characters develop quite a lot in each arc, often seeming like a completely different person by the end of four episodes. Characters that seem useless at the beginning of this anime become more important as the story goes on.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is quite a bit like an unsolved murder case; as more evidence, in other words, information, is acquired, the mystery starts to make sense. For this reason, to fully enjoy Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni, you must not strain yourself trying to figure out what is going on; as the story progresses everything will start to make sense.",

            "content": "This is my first review, and I'll revise it most likely, but I really wanted to write one for this anime.  I don't know where to start, except to say that the story for this show, is just amazing.  I will try to not say many, if any, spoilers, but basically, this is a story about a group of kids who live in a town in which the locals celebrate  this event as a way of appeasing a particular god of sorts.  However, the reason for this, is because of how strange events have occurred in the town  for thepast 5 years.  Each of these events, involves people either dying, or going missing.   \\n\\n\r\nSo through out the show, you get to follow certain characters around and learn how they think of people and about life.  I really can't say too much except that there are plenty of \"wtf?!?!\" moments in the show, whether it is plot related, character related, or just settings related.  Anyway, if you watch it for the first time, you will get confused and will not understand what exactly is going on.  My advice is to just remember what has happened, and think about how it all blends in throughout the show.  \\n\\n\r\nBesides the story, the sound effects, music, and other ambiance noises, are amazing.  The sounds used when you see people change personalities, is extremely haunting!  Best case of this, is episode 3, near the beginning-middle to middle when there is a \"late night conversation\".   The music in the OP and ED are very creepy and fit the show, perfectly.  As for the overall ambiance sound, you hear the cicadas crying in the trees and bushes, which is also why the show is called Higurashi, in the first place.  \\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed this show and then went and watched the second season.   As for last bits of advice, there are a few graphic murder/torture scenes, but they are not that bad, but can be skipped if needed.  Also, if you watched the season and feel like not everything was explained, then I highly recommend watching season 2 because it goes into great amounts of detail in explaining a lot more about the story, the characters, and other things as well.",

            "content": "It\u2019s not my favourite genre, but murder mysteries are something that I really enjoy watching/reading about (unless they\u2019re real, of course). The whole \u2018whodunit\u2019 aspect is really appealing to me, mostly because of the suspense, and, if it\u2019s done well, the little clues that foreshadow the true answer without being too obvious. Last time I watched such an anime, I got so into it that I forgot to make my own deductions. I promised myself that next time, I would also try to solve the mystery. \r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro ni (referred to as Higurashi from now on) seemed like such an anime. Unfortunately, it\u2019sanything but. \\n\\n\r\nWatching Higurashi reminds me of writing an English essay. I know what I want to write it, but I have no idea how to start. I can\u2019t write an introduction to save my life. When I ask for help, I\u2019m told to \u2018state my thesis\u2019, but I don\u2019t even know my thesis. In the end, I write sloppy, repetitive paragraphs with no link between them and a confusing introduction. Then I proof read, and, with some help, finally manage to write something a little more readable.\\n\r\nHigurashi feels just like my crappy first drafts. It\u2019s all over the place, repetitive and without a proper conclusion, forcing you to watch the 2nd season in hopes that the story will somehow sort itself out. The murder mystery that seemed to be prevalent in the anime is nowhere to be found. I suppose there is a little bit of mystery, but you really need to dig deep to just maybe figure out what you\u2019re supposed to be asking yourself. The more obvious mystery elements, notably the deaths and the constituents of a strange drug, do not have an answer within the first season. Despite being mainly within the genres of horror and psychological, it has that awful slice of life feel that after 21 episodes, it feels as if nothing has happened. Why? Because the entire plot line is presented within 3 or 4 episodes which are simply repeated with different characters as the focus. It\u2019s pretty much an omnibus format, but you\u2019re given no clues as to where in time the episode has jumped back to, and what things the characters have done differently to get this outcome. Whenever a new arc started, I had trouble recalling what events had already come to pass and those that were still to come. Furthermore, there is no order to the arcs, as if the director wrote down the names of the different arcs on pieces of paper, pulled them out of a hat and decided that would be the order. Sure, Shion\u2019s arc did shed light on Mion\u2019s arc, and thus had to be after Mion\u2019s, but apart from that, there was no evident reason for the order chosen.\\n\r\nOn the whole, all there is to it is simply little girls turning crazy and killing each other, the end. It\u2019s repetitive, mostly confusing and boring. Explanations passed mainly like they did in No Game No Life - where once character explains everything and the viewer is left mostly in the dark. The only reason why I wasn\u2019t totally lost throughout the whole anime is because I was accidentally spoiled. \\n\r\nAs if that\u2019s not enough, most episodes are full of gore, gore, gore, crazy laughter and more gore. It almost reminds me of Pupa, except it\u2019s not AS graphic (but not by such a wide margin) and doesn\u2019t involve as many pained cries or cannibalism. I\u2019m not squeamish when it comes to blood, in fact I\u2019m a little bit of a sadist, but I found myself looking away from the screen a few times. That fingernail scene in Shion\u2019s arc will certainly haunt me for life. *shudder*\\n\r\nThe one redeeming factor would be that the writers know their cliffhangers. The ending theme has a tendency of starting at the worst moment possible. As a result, even if you have a general idea of what\u2019s going to happen next (though, to the anime\u2019s credit, the events do deviate between arcs), you\u2019re still enticed to press that \u2018next\u2019 button. That\u2019s the only thing that kept me watching all those 26 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters match the plot line standards. There is some diversity in their personalities at the start, but they\u2019re all obviously based off the same format. At the base, they\u2019re all mentally unstable and quick to kill. Well, maybe except for Rika. Rena and Shion are certainly the quickest to go crazy, and as such there is little difference between them. Rena\u2019s love towards cute things makes her crazy side all the weirder.  Shion is an extreme yandere. And by extreme, I mean extreme. The tomboyish, leader-to-be Mion has a girly side. Satoko used to be childish and is now acting like a big sister. Keiichi is a typical male protagonist (and the only one, at that). Nothing I haven\u2019t seen before. Rika is also supposed to be the MC, but Keiichi seems to fill that role better.\\n\r\nPerhaps it\u2019s a part of being mentally unstable, but even though they all become crazy and do pretty much the same things, notably killing, why they go crazy remains mainly a mystery. They tick over almost immediately, without much warning and without obvious reasons. This makes it hard to engage with the characters. \\n\r\nThe \u2018struggles\u2019 between the characters may have valid themes, but they have all been done before - such as friendship vs. trust. There\u2019s also a weird, deformed love triangle that doesn\u2019t add anything to the plot or characters.\\n\\n\r\nOnce you\u2019ve seen it once, you\u2019ve seen it all. That is the story with Higurashi.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s no appeal in the more important constituents of an anime, we could at least that the aesthetic value is high. Nope, sorry to disappoint\u2026 yet again. The art is possibly the worst I\u2019ve seen yet. In fact, I was almost put off watching Higurashi by it. 'Never judging a book by it\u2019s cover\u2019 is only partly valid in this case. \\n\r\nProportions are never exact in anime - whether it\u2019s slightly big head or the huge round eyes, but Higurashi\u2019s proportions were even more crazy. Huge heads and stick-thin limbs are not a good combination. The animation itself though wasn\u2019t that bad (movements weren't jerky or anything). I do remember that there was one scene where the voice acting did not match the animation - hilarious - but apart from that, there were no glaring problems. Gore was disturbing, especially since most of the blood was a disgusting dark brown colour. \\n\\n\r\nAt least sound is here to save the day. The opening does get a little repetitive, since it is the same throughout all 26 episodes, but it was a good opening theme, so I didn\u2019t mind that much. The ending theme was good, since the somewhat calm theme was often a large contrast against the previous events of the episode. The bad thing about it is that it\u2019s entirely sung in English, with the least fitting words. And it\u2019s not even like Danganronpa\u2019s OP, where the English pronunciation was decent, but Engrish. The words are also sung really word, like a loud whisper combined with sighs and bit of a tune. I mostly skipped it. \\n\r\nOne thing we can thank the VN for is the wide range of BGM. I find myself complaining a lot that there isn\u2019t enough music during an anime. Well, not with Higurashi. They wouldn\u2019t go down as some of my favourite tracks, but there were pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to sum up my feeling towards Higurashi in one word, it would probably be \u2018what?\u2019. What is the plot line? What is happening? What has already happened? What is up with the art? What is the point of this much gore? \\n\r\nWhat did I miss that made most others give a score of 8 and above?\\n\r\nI\u2019ve had this same feeling with the Monogatari Series. Everyone loves the anime, but it seems as if I somehow missed this vital ingredient. Maybe it\u2019s just me, or maybe it\u2019s easy to miss. Higurashi wasn\u2019t a total failure, but I was certainly extremely disappointed.\\n\r\nThere is a bit of a\u2026 \u2018twist\u2019 to this, however. I believe it is possible that the terrible plot line and characters were actually what keep you watching - especially when it comes to the 2nd season. You\u2019re so confused that you can\u2019t help but want to know the answers. In that sense, Higurashi was simply an introduction - a bad one, but then again a bad introduction doesn\u2019t necessarily herald a bad story/essay/etc. Hopefully, Higurashi no naku koro ni kai will, as the description says, \"shed some light on the dark mysteries prevalent in the preceding season.\u201d I suppose it\u2019s up to you whether or not this is an efficient marketing technique\u2026 just kidding.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Higurashi no Naku koro ni is a poorly executed anime with few redeeming factors, but not torturous to watch.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 4/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4.6/10 - rounded to a 5\\n\\n\r\n\u2014 - - \u2014 - - \u2014 - - \u2014 - - \u2014 - - \u2014 - - \u2014 - - \u2014 - - \u2014 - \u2014 - - \u2014 - - \u2014 - - \u2014 - - \u2014 - - \u2014 \\n\\n\r\nThoughts?

            "content": "'WARNING' \r\nThere is a lot of blood but it isn't overly graphic and this is a theme throughout, with the exception of one or two stills, so, unless you really hate blood, don't let it put you off. \r\nI'm writing this review 15 episodes in because I genuinely couldn't watch beyond that point in one go. I'm definitely planning to go back to this because I just have to know the reason why these little kiddies are butchering each other.\r\nIt's definitely a headscratcher. \r\nStory - 8 \r\nFrom what I can gather the series is done in an way similar to the omnibus style of animeslike Amagami SS and Yosuga No Sora except for a minor change. Instead of the main and the girl skipping off into the sunset hand in hand, and then the whole thing repeats with a different girl, Higurashi's mini-arcs ends with the main and/or one or more of his female friends dying pretty gruesomely. The first two mini-arcs were particularly horrifying. At first glance there doesn't seem to be much of a connection between the arcs but don't let it fool you. They are all little pieces of a bigger puzzle and that's where the true strength of Higurashi's story lies. I won't say more about the actual story because 1) I don't know it all myself and 2) I don't want to spoil it for anybody reading this.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\r\nThis area, I feel is Higurashi's big drawback. The art of the characters is weak and looks to have been done, either in a hurry, or with a small budget. There are definitely some positives though, with the stills of some of the environments taking the fore here.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nI'm being generous. My recommendation is to watch this subbed because I watched it in dub format  and there will never be a more annoying bunch of voice actors ever assembled to work on one anime. The opening theme is truly haunting. Beyond that, I didn't really notice the soundtrack much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9 \\n\r\nAnother massive strength of Higurashi is it's characters. You cannot relax for a second with any of them. In one episode they can be sweet, innocent and charming and in the next they're hammering nails through your joints and dismembering you alive. All of them seem to have some ulterior motive that isn't entirely their own and all of them act like they are under some outside influence, leading to some genuinely creepy moments. If it wasn't for those facts you'd have your stereotypical harem, more-or-less. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8 \\n\r\nMuch like School Days, I'm not entirely sure you're supposed to enjoy watching this. It's a regular guts and gore fest and if you enjoy the fact that this is being carried out by twelve year olds, it probably means your childhood was tainted by the Happy Tree Friends and you ought to toddle on off to the nearest therapist ASAP. The true enjoyment of Higurashi comes from trying to deduce the reasoning behind the Curse of Oyashiro. I'm over halfway through the anime and I'm still puzzling over whether the spate of killings is the result of some kind of supernatural phenomenon or not. Whether enjoyment is the right word or not, it'll definitely occupy your thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\r\nDefinitely one for the Sherlock Holmes' of anime fans. The mystery is pretty deep and I can only hope that it does a satisfying job of pulling all the seemingly unconnected threads together, either in this season or the next. It's also one if you like to be freaked out repeatedly. It isn't in-your-face scary but the ominous feeling you get from watching this will definitely send shivers down your spine. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm going to go and finish watching it and finally find out what is what.",

            "content": "Keep this in mind- I write this review after seeing all the seasons of Higurashi. \r\nNote- If you don't want to be spoiled on how the story is told and want to go off the story summary, then do not read the story section of this review. Otherwise this review is spoiler-free.\r\nStory- Higurashi has a very unique story to it. It shows basically the same setting, but in each arc different things happen. The show then leads you down bad endings (visual novel terms as it is based off a visual novel) in hopes to give you hints about what is really going on. Itis the viewers job to gather the information given to you and attempt to find out what is going on. Seeing as this is the FIRST season, of course it will not be resolved by the end of it. Another interesting fact is that when arcs are revisited, it's done in another character's point of view. This adds even more to the story. The various stories eventually come together to help lead to the truth. What is the truth? Well that is what the SECOND season is for. Basically this is a mystery, and if you like a good ol Mature-rated mystery then this is the show fits that category big time. \\n\\n\r\nArt- People say this is a downfall of Higurashi. The animation is \"plain and simple and painful\" to look at is a consensus I seem to be getting after looking online for a while. However, I would like to argue otherwise. The animation, while plain and simple, adds even more to the series. It goes from a innocent and kid-like  animation to a dark and murderous one. The transition between these types of animations help set it apart from other murder/mystery/slice of life/ect. shows. The faces when people go insane or afraid also give the show more original animation then it already had. This was done so well that other shows tried to pull it off, but couldn't do it to the extent Higurashi did. A downfall is that the art is, at times, flat for too long which could bring people out of the moment when they do not find the humor or scenes to be to their liking. So while is animation might not be the best quality, it certainly holds a deeper meaning then looking its best.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Before i start with music, can I just say that Higurashi's dub is one of the worst dubbings I have ever heard in my entire lifetime. Seriously, the voices don't match the characters at all and it is all just one big convoluted mess. So this is pretty much the only con I have with the sound of the show. Anyways the opening (which has the same title as the show itself) is probably one of the best openings of all time. The music and tempo match perfectly with the show itself. It lets you know what you are getting into. Then ending \"Why, or Why Not\" may be slow and a bit boring at times, does provide some more atmosphere of the calmer and darker side of Higurashi.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- The characters are all unique and different. Each character has a motivation or desire that is brought on by something that happened in their past. Rena and Shion's past give us the ability to relate with them. It humanizes some of the decisions they make as they are not full stereotypes. Sure they are in some respects, and that doesn't bother me much. It is the buildup to the character that I want to see, and that is what I got (again not all characters are touched on due to their being a second season). So the only thing I can critique it on is that it is incomplete in that regard. Although it is corrected in the second season, which is why I did not take a lot of points off its score.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. I love a good mystery and this certainly was a great start to that. The violence and gore did get to me a bit but I expected it coming in. It's like watching a horror movie, you don't come in expecting sunshine and rainbows. No, you come in to expect violence, a good mystery, and a reasonable conclusion. And as again this is the FIRST season, Higurashi fulfilled all the requirements for me to give it 10. Again, I have a different sense of taste than most people so those who do not enjoy violence, gore, and such should probably stay away.\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi is a great start to an amazing story. It gives me all I need to be locked in to the characters and enough clues and surprises to keep me guessing. I hate rating shows by seasons because this show is technically one anime (combined with Kai) and I cannot include everything I want to praise the show about or depraise. So while this would be the end of my review it isn't This review is incomplete until I finish the review of Kai.",

            "content": "I&rsquo;m not a fan of horror films. I get scared easily over things that will most likely never happen in the real world. Despite all of this, I still decided to take a look at Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni, even though I knew what I was getting myself into. I&rsquo;m glad I did.\r\nThe use of deception can be tricky to master. Use it too much, and the story becomes too difficult to follow, while not enough can make the show predictable and take away from the shock value. Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni manages to travel along this line, for the most part, perfectly.It puts you into a false sense of security with a typical shonen harem exterior, only to make your eyes shoot wide open with shocking violence and torture. No amount of preparation can set you up for it; it hits just as hard every time. Unfortunately, this system trips up at about the half-way point. For two episodes, the story stumbles off that fine line and becomes uninteresting. Luckily, the story recovers and puts up a strong finish.\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing that really sells this anime is the seiyuu. A flat cast here would&rsquo;ve taken a lot of the suspense out of Higurashi. Luckily, everyone does their part and then some. The way the cast effortlessly swings from playful to psychotic along with the story is nothing short of amazing. The cast is accompanied by a simple, yet oh so effective soundtrack that adds to the suspense. There&rsquo;s just something about two high pitched violins in a horror anime that sends chills up my spine.\\n\\n\r\nThere is just one more part, or rather one person, that bothers me about Higurashi. One character, Officer Ooishi, becomes a nuisance rather quickly. His constant appearance and smug attitude at the situations unfolding on the screen becomes quite tiresome and annoying. I understand that he is an important part of the plot, but is it asking too much for him not to stick his nose in as far as he does on a regular basis?\\n\\n\r\nDespite this, I really can&rsquo;t knock Higurashi down too much. Did this anime scare me? Several times, yes, but it was worth it. Will this change how I feel about the horror genre? Not at all, but as long as you have a strong stomach, Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni is a series that shouldn&rsquo;t be skipped.",

            "content": "Ok so this is my first review. I just wanted to give it a try so, here it is.  \r\nHigurashi no naku koro ni... hm yeah at first I just wanted to try a scary and violent anime because lately, I haven't watched anything of the sort. Ok so, when I watched the first episode the only thing I could think of was the crappy animation. For me, the art in an anime is like the cover of a book. If the cover makes the book seem bad i don't read it. However this anime just shows how the saying \"Don't judge a bookby its cover\" is totally correct. \\n\\n\r\nStory: One of the best, most original and greatly achieved stories out there. At first Higurashi no naku koro ni seemed like an anime that was purely made for the sake of violence. But if you keep watching you will soon realize it is not. It has a very cleaver and unique plot. The fact that the story is repeated like 8 times all over the series (including HnNKnK) isn't anoying at all. You just don't get bored.\\n\r\nFor all of these reasons but mostly for its originality i give the story a 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Well this is the one weak (very weak if i may) spot this anime has. I don't mean the drawing itself. I think the quality of the animation is what bothers me the most. It made it seem like a crapy anime. It is just bad. The good thing is the animation was greatly improved for the next 2 seasons (Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai + Rei), so it didn't bother me anymore. Just to make things clear I like the drawings. I like how the characters look like and the landscapes. The thing i hated was the animation. OK?? OK fine. I gave art a 6. (just for the first season though)\\n\\n\r\nSound: Well i don't know how to rate sound. I mean the voice actors are great. The only bad thing is, there were times when the voice didn't seem to fit in the situation the characters were (e.g. when Mion (or was that shion...I don't remember anymore lawl) is shaking the ladder which keiichi is trying to climb). \\n\r\nOther than that the openings and endings (including kai and rei) are excellent. I would even say, some of the best openings and endings I've heard. (I love Kai's ending Taishou.a). I gave sound a big 8.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Characters are epic. Rena. Who the hell would not remember Rena after that epic yell. (\"USO DA!!!\"). Rika, shes one of my top 5 fave anime characters. I don't know why i just like her. Shes...great! I don't know. You will certainly like her. \\n\r\nAnd well the other characters are also nice but i found those two the best.\\n\r\nOne thing i HAVE to mention about these characters is how moe they seem at first (e.g Rena: \"kana, kana?\" Rika: \"nippaa!\" and so on) but they are much more than just cute catch-frases. Just watch and you will see. I gave character a big big 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I don't know. There's a feeling certain animes give to my soul for some unknown reason. Higurashi sure is one of them. \\n\r\nI enjoyed it a lot! Therefore: 10. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Ok overall ill give it an 8. I think it deserves a 9. But the second season was way better than the first one. However it does not deserve a 10. So to make clear that kai is better than the first one, I gave this one an 8.\\n\r\nHowever I'm not sure why I am not giving kai a 10. I mean it deserves it... OH what the heck ill give this one a 9 and kai a 10 yeah thats it. :)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is a very strange anime to say the least, at some points it's a fun pure hearted comedy, and the next minute they're talking about vicious murders. Even though it seems wierd to have a comedy/horror - i think that's what'd you call it - be good, but it transitions almost perfectly. With great characters with very creepy laughs, Higurashi has one of the best characters in any anime I've ever seen. I won't reveal much, but with the strange story transitions and occasional bloody times, the story will make you love eachepisode and make you want to watch the next one just to see what happens, you will know what it's like to be one of those stay at home mothers who watch soap operas all day. lol",

            "content": "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is probably one of the most difficult to watch animes. The way the story is presented is sure to make any viewer stare at the screen, wandering what the hell is happening. That\u2019s because the series is made up of individual arcs, telling similar stories about the same people, but taking place at different times, or even at parallel universes! Also, the first impressions this series gives are totally misleading \u2013 the first episode, as well as the first episodes of each arc, seem more like harem comedy than the horror mystery the series is supposed to be. So, unlessthe viewers show enough patience for the story to unfold, they would be mistaken to think Higurashi is just another of those overrated, meaningless animes.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what a mistake they would have made\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe beautifully written script, together with the innovative way it is presented, make for one of the most gripping mystery stories out there. Each arc begins in the seemingly peaceful and cheerful Hinamizawa village. Through the eyes of each arc\u2019s protagonist, we see that blissful image being gradually torn apart, as old mysteries and modern murders are constantly revealed. They will take their toll on the protagonist, and by the end of the arc\u2019s end there will be a cruel, bloody finale - usually with the protagonist committing murder, then finding their own tragic demise. Each of the six different arcs presents a slightly different version of the same story, be it from another person\u2019s view, from a different time or with key events altered. As the different stories unfold, the viewer will have more and more questions about what \u2013 and why - is happening, some of which will be answered as episodes pass by. But the stories are each time presented from a subjective point of view, so nothing revealed is bound to be the actual truth.\\n\\n\r\nArtwise, Higurashi is surely not the most breathtaking anime. The character designs often appear faded or not properly animated. However, the artistic style itself is pretty amazing. The cute character designs create a big contrast with their dark stories. The way their eyes and faces start deforming when they are flooded with rage is one of the creepiest aspects of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe character voices work astonishingly well both at the comedic and the dramatic parts of the series. Particularly Rika\u2019s voice is perfect. It could make anyone melt with its cuteness \u2013 but it also has another, more serious \u00abmode\u00bb that sounds almost otherworldly. Moreover, Mion\u2019s laughter has to be noted as one of the scariest, creepiest laughters in history. But where sound gets my 10 from is the opening theme - \u00abHigurashi no Naku Koro ni\u00bb from Eiko Shimamiya \u2013 which is going to send shivers down your spine no matter how many times you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are another of the strong elements of the show. They all have, despite their young age and superficial cuteness, very dark backgrounds. In each arc, we see them transform from ordinary kids to bloodthirsty murderers. Other than the main team of young protagonists, there are many others who also get their share of character development.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is my all-time favorite anime series, due to its gripping story, it\u2019s suspense and its healthy dosage of elements from many other anime categories. That being said, there are quite a few gory scenes in Higurashi \u2013 nothing like the intensity of those in Elfen Lied of course, though many seem to think they are similar, for some reason \u2013 but the shocking aspect of the show lies mostly in the people committing these acts, not the acts themselves. All in all, if you think you can handle the medium amount of gore - and the truly gigantic amount of confusion \u2013 in the series, then you really have to watch his show. Also, if you decide to do so, keep in mind that there are two continuation series (Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei) that, together with the original series, tell the whole story.\\n",

            "content": "I really liked this one. After two episodes, I knew I was hooked. I love an anime with blood and gore, and this show delivered, but it gave a lot more, the story was well written and instead of just waiting to see someone get killed, I was actually really interested in this story, even more than usual. I enjoyed the thrill, the suspense, and the shock of finding out who died, who killed them, where, and why, and also seeing how the characters develop the mental state that drove them to murder. And the curse was the most interesting thing, with each time thestory shifted, you get a little bit more information about it, which just added to the suspense.\\n\r\nI'll admit that I got a little lost and confused and frustrated after like episode 5 (when the story reset for the first time), but then it started to make sense, and I liked how each of the story \"arcs\" showed the end, then showed how it got to that point, but also each arc was different, but connected to each other in the long run. What blew me away the most was how, like the end of the arcs were shown at the beginning of the arc, the very end of the series was connected to the beginning of the series in a way that I completely forgot about... BRILLIANT!\\n\\n\r\nI found out that there is another season, and I kinda hope they continue from where this one left off, but if it goes a different route, I'm still pretty excited to check it out. See you guys in the next season.",

It's a highly reputable and dark cult classic with a unique ability to flick between states of innocence and happy days, to the most psychotic of attitudesand moral standpoints regarding the recurring theme of death, the occult and torture galore... So i'm gonna stop you right there if you're a little faint of heart...\\n\\n\r\nDespite the inclusion of many young girly characters, Higurashi defies their \\n\r\ntied-in stereotypes and stays pretty well away in hindsight from any form of relaxed presentation. Like the masterful horror piece that it is, Higurashi instead continuously refreshes a fear of the unknown. It works wonders in the way that the theme of death is continuously reinforced, how it forever looms over the ENTIRE cast; perusing them relentlessly. As a result, the viewer always seems to be left in a highly suspenseful state, and due to the show's unpredictable state-switching, it's easy to relate to, and immerse oneself in the realistic and vivid plights and confused feelings of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nEffortlessly, it taunts you with your own curiosity, and will always take you off-guard. It throws rocks into your trail that cause you to stumble and fall over in confusion, all-in-all boosting the power, and weighty mystery atmosphere that it has - to boast. \\n\\n\r\nHigurashi is really confusing at times, and whereas near the start, you may feel that you've begun a very elaborate sequence of deaths, it's more so a cycle. You see, the main device that it uses is a seamless time and perspective shift, that defines the show as detail driven, as opposed to a more predictably plot driven production. This is also where the gateway for historical, and more importantly: character development elements come into play.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the the show's unique selling points, is the way that it intimately exposes the thought processes of all parties involved in a common incident. It's a very thought provoking show that presents a variety of conflicting morals...\\n\r\nwhile the chaos of the abstract and mind-bending story presentation is appropriate for the chaotic struggle of all the characters' emotional states and drives, it's understandable that some viewers may not appreciate its questionable methods.\\n\\n\r\nLooking back, the plot was extremely vivid and well considered. While at times, it might seem nonsensical, it's one of THOSE shows with a lot of dramatic twists and secrets to hide, that make it all the more interesting. It's almost as if they solve one mystery, by introducing another...\\n\\n\r\nLater on, Higurashi's methods become more clear-cut, and it becomes more of a dramatic horror towards its (fyi: inconclusive) ending \"climax\". I must say that you'll have one hell of a time piecing everything together if you do learn everything that the show has to offer, and it's this addicting, thought provoking and morally questioning nature that is the beauty of the show...\\n\\n\r\nSomething very dark, straying FAR from cliche, and being unlike anything else I've watched...\\n\r\nI could anticlimactically rant for awhile now about how the character development isn't perfectly spread, and how the art is mediocre...\\n\r\nbut i agree on so many levels with the writer and animators' refreshing look at the occult. The dark, psychotic themes resonate with me, and i feel like it was a show made to appease our horror cravings, on a large scale.\\n\r\nUltimately...  i wouldn't want to defile the name of Higurashi with ANYTHING less than a 10.\\n\r\n(so far, i plan on starting season 2 soon!)",

My only complaints are that the last arc explaining away every unexplained aspect of the first several arcs ruined a lot of it, except the first arc. My other complaint is that if you were unaware that it was a visual novel first, the transitions between arcs are somewhat nonsensical, it could have been adapted better in this way, but otherwise is incredibly well adapted. Does horrific moments incredibly well, truly chilling. Doesn't rely on cheap tactics like jump scares, and when things aredisturbing, it really revels in the hopelessness and terror of it all. Characters are very well done too, particularly since they're different in each arc. If not for the ending of season 1 I would give this anime a perfect 10.",

            "content": "In my estimation, this anime is another case of the fan-base of an anime over-stating how good an anime is. \r\nGiven the high praise the series has received, I was quite interested in seeing what much of the community has praised as being one of the best horror anime available. Unfortunately, I was left unimpressed by it.\r\nStory:\r\n(I should preface this in saying that, while I talk about the story's inconsistencies and how things aren't very clear, I'm not looking for something with a simple story; quite the contrary. One of my favorite films is 2001: A Space Odyssey and one of my favorite game franchisesis the Metal Gear Solid series, both of which are notoriously confusing to understand, with the former being highly symbolic with the latter being simply very complex and you just have to dissect it. I do believe, however, that there are effective ways at leaving things \"open-ended\"  and others that just come off as poor story-telling, where Higurashi no Naku Koro ni falls into the latter category. There are hardly any pieces, really to put things together, and it's also not intended to really be heavily symbolic. You start the series with a certain major questions that structure everything and you finish with those same questions unanswered which makes it impossible to piece anything together without pure speculation.)\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most disappointing aspects of the anime is the story. The story is told in a set of six arcs focusing on the same exact sequence of events but as a different \"arc\" which tends to feel a bit repetitive by the end of it. It's also unclear what the goal of doing so was, as well. There is no real resolution as to why the episodes are all similar. There is some overlap in the stories of certain episodes, but you're left wondering why it appears that the sequence of events are reoccurring and, by the end of it, it appears to hint at the loop simply restarting. The first loop takes you by surprise after roughly the sixth episode or so, but it's never clarified by the end why the loop is occurring or if it's even ended, for that matter, even if it's hinted that it continues. Now, to it's credit, since I have yet to see the second season, it's possible that it's explained in the next season, but, as is, it's rather unsatisfying a first season. I should clarify, however, that I'm not simply opposed to there being a few things left unanswered and a few mysteries left to solve when setting up for a second season; that's perfectly understandable and makes the next season desirable to watch. However, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni's entire story structure was left unexplained. It's not just that there were a few mysteries still to solve, but that they didn't really provide enough to give the viewer a sense of what was going on. It's as though everything was just left a mystery rather than just leaving a few things still as a mystery to explain in a second season. \\n\\n\r\nAnother issue I had with the story was the end to the last arc of the season. It wasn't immediately obvious whether that was the \"real\" ending that finished the loops or if they continued. In the end of the last arc, there are a lot of things that seem like they may be intended as the \"real\" story of what's going on which, if that's the case, then it really is an odd ending, in my estimation. Without spoilers, the \"reason\" that they give for a lot of the odd behaviors that you see throughout the series comes totally out of left field, and not in a good way. It doesn't sound like a \"big reveal\" that was carefully crafted, but felt more uninspired and completely out of nowhere that I found myself laughing when they \"revealed\" it. Again, this may have just been the ending to the sixth arc which still wasn't the \"real\" ending to the loop, but if it was, it was sorely disappointing. There's just so little resolution to the story at the end and there's never any real clarification as to why the loop is occurring that it's hard to be satisfied at all with the ending. \\n\\n\r\nAnother issue that struck me was how many of the events don't make very much sense. What I mean by that, is not that I don't understand what's going on, but, rather, there are certain behaviors or events that don't really have much motivation for them and there are events or behaviors of characters that feel like they came from nowhere or could have been avoided rather easily. 'Plot-holes' isn't quite the right word for it, but I suppose it's adequate in describing some of the inconsistencies that I found through the anime. There were simply too many instances where I'd be asking myself, \"Wait, why did the character just ___? They don't even have a reason to and they could have just ___ which would have avoided all of that.\" \\n\\n\r\nTo its credit, there are a lot of little details which they do pay attention to such as making references to other arcs or doing something that maybe retells bits of a previous arc from a different perspective, but, again, it's never clarified on why there is overlap between the arcs or why they're occurring so the apparent \"overlap\" doesn't appear to hold any significance. Is the \"overlap\" the \"real\" story? Is the story repeating until they finally arrive at a \"good\" sequence of events which will look like most of the overlap? Is it just a series of disjointed tails that happen to look like each other? Was the last arc the \"true\" arc? Was the last episode actually a hint at the arcs repeating again? There were even things about characters that were revealed that seemed like they were true in some episodes, but not in others, so what was \"actually\" true about the characters and what wasn't? There are some things that hint that they may be connected in the last arc, but hardly anything really satisfying. In fact, the way in which they all feel connected is like, the third arc sort of has little references to the second arc, the fourth to the third, the fifth to the fourth, and the sixth to the first. The fact that the overall structure of storytelling was never even explained or clarified as to why it was occurring is part of my frustration with the story as you couldn't tell what \"actually\" happened, what was \"actually\" true about the characters, and separate that from stuff that was just part of that particular arc and things that were supposed to be true of the characters. Again, since I haven't seen the second season, I could be unfairly judging it, but as it stands, the story was hardly satisfying. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nNext to the story, my other least favorite thing was the art. In fact, this was much worse than the story. The art style is the rather stereotypical mid 2000's style that just looks really bland and uninspired. It wasn't just the character art style, though, that I felt looked bad, but also the quality of work. There were so many angles that were really poorly done, in my opinion, and felt like something from an amateur studio. Lots of really off looking proportions and perspectives that felt very amateur. \\n\\n\r\nI do like the fact that they're trying to do the whole \"cute girl gone psycho\" trope and I think sometimes it can work as it's fairly effective, but I think they just abused it to death -- no pun intended --, they didn't execute it very well, and they never did anything else beyond that.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was actually not bad. The musical score, especially, was adequate for the series. Several tracks really set the atmosphere and even the opening theme was fine, as well. There were a few tracks that were sort of mediocre, but I think overall it was possibly one of the higher points of the series. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were fine, but nothing special. The \"slice of life\" portions of the anime were part of what I disliked about many mid 2000's anime where the \"moe\" characters are painfully cringy to watch. \"Shuffle!\" was another good example of this. To its credit, however, there is some variety in how the characters are expressed throughout the series since each arc is slightly different so you see a \"different side\" to each of the characters. However, again, because the story isn't not very clear, it's difficult to determine what's \"actually\" part of their character and what isn't and is just part of \"that arc\" and won't be true in the next arc. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\\n\r\nI don't hate the anime, but I wasn't really amazed by it at all. It wasn't really a chore to get through it, but it was still pretty forgettable, in my opinion. I mean, if you like moe girls and gore, then have at it, but it didn't really feel like much more than that. The story was just a bunch of tropes strung together in a form that wasn't explained, which left it feeling like it wasn't even the point of watching the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nI won't say that it was a complete chore getting through the anime, but it didn't really have any impact on me as a horror anime. When I watch a good work of horror, I expect it to stick with me for several day. I expect it to have a big impact on me and get me thinking. I expect it to cause me great uneasiness and anxiety while watching the entire thing. This... this just didn't do any of that. It was just a little gory and the topics a bit more mature. That's basically it. It's relying too much on the \"cute girl gone psycho\" trope to push the feeling of horror, but I think it relies far too heavily on it. After a while, I just started getting bored with it as much of it was just a repetition of the same thing and you knew that a cute girl was going to become really violent. The feelings of uneasiness, if they even exist at all, begin to diminish after the first two arcs or so. \\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is: \\n\\n\r\n1.) Moe high school setting \\n\r\n2.) Moe girl goes psycho \\n\r\n3.) Moe girl is going to be covered in people's blood by the end of the arc. \\n\r\n4.) Rinse and repeat for six arcs of 26 episodes of the same core events told slightly differently with a different psycho moe girl. \\n\\n\r\nIf this were really the best in horror anime available, it would appear to me that anime wouldn't have much to offer the horror genre.",

If a series wants to invoke fear, I believe it NEEDS to stay away from 4-head-tall character designs that have stupid, unnatural ways of speaking, unnatural hair, and no variation in wardrobe If you are writing a fun, adventure shonen manga, go for it. If you are writing mystery/horror, it's just stupid. The story-telling was also bad. Parts that should have created an emotional impact failed to do so, and I never cared enoughabout any character to feel moved when they died.

But still it is good:-)\\n\r\nSoundtracks: soundtracks are definitely the plus point of this anime. Especially the opening song sung by Eiko Shimamiya named \"HIGURASHI NO NAKU KORO NI\".

U will see peace lover KEICHII. Both cute and violent RENA and SHION. Strong willed leader and quite tomboyish MION. And there is RIKA and SATOKO. Satoko played a great role. RIKA is n't given priority in this season\\n\r\nSince this series contains a great deal of violence, child abuse you shouldn't watch this if u have any problems. And don't back down only after watching the first two min of the first episode\\n\r\ni know you will have a lot of questions while watching this. Don't worry, there is almost(or none?) no plot hole.

It sucks you in without even knowing it with a brutal (in a good way) storyline and deep characters. I didn't even realize how much i enjoyed it until i had finished it. i had seen a few video clipsof some of the more gruesome scenes from the show and had always been hesitant to try it, just because i usually am not into horror and gore and the whatnot. But the show doesn't rely on the gore factor to keep it's watchers intrigued, surprisingly. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is absolutely amazing. it's one of those plots that almost doesn't quite make sense until literally the last few moments of the final episode. But once you've watched that it's like \"Load universe into cannon, fire at brain.\" if at first you get a little confused by the style of the story then don't worry, i did too a little. Higurashi's style is pretty unique and i actually had to read up on the game it's based off of to get a better grasp on it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is ok. it's definitely not going to floor you, but it's not going to detract from the show at all. there are few moments that it get's kicked up a notch, mostly whenever someone goes crazy, but mostly it's pretty dang simple.\\n\\n\r\nthe sound is very good. the opening theme is very fitting for the dark nature of the anime and the in-show sound clips are very artistically used, giving crazy moments an even more sinister feel. the voice acting is mostly great, but i personally didn't like Keiichi's voice. a bit too whiny for me, but it's not a huge deal.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters and character development are almost as top notch as the story. at first glance the setting seems like a normal slice of life school drama with a possible harem added in for fun. Then the characters glare at you with the most evil eyes ever drawn in anime and brandish hatchets and bats at you. just about every character is not what they seem and it's so much fun to find out all their crazy little secrets\\n\\n\r\noverall, simply a great anime. it's not perfect, but it is DEFINITELY worth watching and no avid anime watcher should go without this one in his \"completed\" section. can't wait to watch the sequel series. thanks for reading my first review\\n\\n",

Well, this anime is one that I like to bring up over most anime that you would consider \u201cnot a kid\u2019s show\u201d, because of how great the story line is andjust how intelligently the plot is carried out. Higurashi no Naku Koroni is a horror, mystery anime that is really much more than that in my point of view.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts out with Keiichi moving in to a town named Hinamizawa, where he meets new people, makes new friends, and soon starts to discover the secrets that this strange town holds. Now, the first episode spoils the ending of the first chapter, and as you will know, a lot of people will die in this show, many times. \\n\\n\r\nAs Keiichi soon realizes, most of the \u201cdeaths\u201d happen when the Cotton Drifting festival occurs and the curse of Oyashiro-sama supposedly arrives. The curse seems to bring paranoia and eventually death to certain people in the village. The most interesting thing about the Higurashi series is that the story is carried out in a time-loop kind of thing, where after one set of deaths happens, the story goes back and everyone is alive again. Higurashi is based on a visual novel and the anime seems to show al the \u201cbad endings\u201d in the VN. These bad endings are necessary for you to piece together and figure out the truth to these deaths.\\n\\n\r\nI just really love how this anime gives you small hints and clues during each death case it gives you only to show you something even more gruesome, which confuses you with what you thought was true. The first season of this anime shows you all the death cases while the second season reveals everything to you and actually gives you a pretty awesome and heart-warming ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nNow, most people would say that the animation quality for Higurashi is awful, with which I would agree, but, the transition between the light and fluffy animation parts to the eerie and spooky animation parts makes me argue that the lower animation quality can add to the sudden change in atmosphere. The transition really throws you off and adds to the scare score. Higurashi is also famous for its \u201cHigurashi face\u201d, where the character\u2019s faces look pretty insane and scary.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe Higurashi series\u2019 soundtrack still amazes me to this day. One of the pieces includes one titled \u201cMain Theme\u201d which offers pretty eerie and freaky atmospheric background music. \\n\r\nThe openings are amazing! The song for the first opening was one of the things that kept me watching the series, considering on how unnerving the series was, in a good way. The openings prepare you for what is to come and really gets you in the mood. In my opinion, I liked the first opening song better than the second, but I like the second opening\u2019s animation over the first.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nWhen you first watch this series, it is hard to get attached to the characters at first, due to them either being freakishly haunting and scary when it comes to those parts, or die in first few episodes. But once you get deeper into the story, you start to get attached to the different character\u2019s personality especially during the parts where the characters are having fun, playing games, and getting closer to each other. In the first season, there are just so many deaths, where even some of them are mysteries or aren\u2019t explained that you just get confused and scared about what\u2019s going on and you feel bad for the characters. During the second season, things start to get clearer, deaths are starting to be explained, the whole time loop thing is revealed and you get attached to the characters as they fight to change their destined deaths.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime as a horror and mystery show just because of how the plot is carried out and how it slowly feeds you the horror at the perfect and most unexpected times. It did a great job in its pacing but you really can\u2019t just stop at the first season, you must, and I really mean it, you must watch the second season to find out the truth and wrap up the whole series. Plus, Hanyuu, one of the cutest characters there, doesn\u2019t appear till the second season, so, watch it!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think that this series will become a classic in its genre and really enjoyed it. Even though it\u2019s a horror anime, giving you horrible experiences of death and despair, and is emotionally jarring, it has its funny moments and can be emotional towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nI know that I\u2019m reviewing both the seasons at the same time, but it\u2019s really hard and frustrating to review the first season without the second season for me. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is just great in itself and is a prime example to why anime isn\u2019t just for kids and can be enjoyed by teens, young adults, and adults who just love a good horror/mystery show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall well-rounded, well-made, and perfectly executed, I give this a 9/10. I would like to give it a perfect score, but as this is a professional critique, I like to consider the possibilities as to why others might not like this (gruesomely violent and rather jarring). \\n",

Because it's so crazy in the beginning.. And so unexpected at the end. Don't try to figure out, who's the murderer... because it's changing! It depends on what part you're watching. At the first (when I was wathing second part) I thought : something is weird here.. Hey! They're all dead! Later I was wondering why this story doesn't have sense.. But near ~20 episode I finally understood.\r\nOh, don't watch the last episode, because you'll loseall enjoy while watching it.\\n\\n\r\nFor art: 9\\n\r\nAnd here someone will ask me: why not 10? Hm.. Because I like older style of line.. There isn't note like 9,5 (shame). Colours are really nice and peaceful, blood looks like real :) Something for fans of mass kill and a fountain of blood :)\\n\\n\r\nFor sound:9\\n\r\nOpening is great, nothing much nothing less. But ending.. It's worse.. I didn't like it at all (please, don't kill me, if you like it).\\n\\n\r\nFor enjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis depends on what we like to watch. But for me, fan of mass kill, mystery and dreadful moments this anime was just fantastic. I wanted to watch more and more.. And now I can't wait till I watch next season..\\n\\n\r\nconclusion:\\n\r\nIf you like anime styles like horror, mystery, blood and friendship, this anime will stay in your memory for looong time.\\n\r\nBut..\\n\r\nIf you like lovey-dovey.. F**k off and go away >.> and watch love hina or something like that :P\\n\r\n(I don't have anything to this anime, don't kill)\\n\\n\r\nThat's all.\\n\\n\r\nSorry for stupid mistakes, but I'm just Polish girl with fascination in English and anime :)",

            "content": "Story: 9/10\r\nHigurashi has been one of the most interesting anime story I've seen.   It goes from a mystery murder cases and connects it to aspects such as supernatural beings, and at one point of the series: aliens.  The story structure is also very unique because it is composed of mini story arcs where each of the characters will be given their own back story.  These mini arcs are composed of 3 to 6 episodes, wherein after one arc the story resets again with all the characters alive to begin another arc with a different story this time. The first half ofthe series being the 'Questions arc' while the second half the 'Answers arc'  which is actually an answer to the series of events that happened in the answers arc.  But a mini spoiler,  you will not get the complete answer and that's why there is a 2nd season to this series. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nArt style and animation are not the most beautiful out there.  Honestly, I was not a big fan of it.  Though the opening sequence is beautiful when it comes to the animation and art style the rest of the series is not.  The comedy also feels awkward at time when it comes to animation, really really awkward.  Also I want to point out an animation failure at the 2nd arc, episode 6 or 7 I think, where Mion was shaking the ladder where Keichi was climbing.  Just watch that clip and I'm telling you it's very very weird.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for the series is something I commend when it comes in giving the feel of horror in the series.  Also the opening sequence, being a very great starter for an episode to give you the creeps.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters of the series are heavily developed every ending of an arc.  Especially for the relevant characters per arc, like Keichi in the first arc, Mion and Shion in the second arc, are three characters that were developed in their own arcs.  My favorite character though is Oishi.  He is a policeman first introduced at episode 2, and just when you thought he will be the shed of light in the series due to his actions in the first arc, the series portrayed him to be a corrupt cop in succeeding arcs.  I like the way he was portrayed that way making the viewers unexpected of his actions.  My least favorite would be Rika, though I'm aware the she will be most relevant in the 2nd season,  I was not a fan of hers in the first season just because there was not much development happening within her.  So that's why I really wanted this character to have a boost in the 2nd season.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nWhile I mentioned a while ago that the comedy is very awkward and it's something I actually did not enjoy, which is why it's weird,  the enjoyment I had for this series is its horror, gore, and mystery aspect.  Don't watch this for the comedy, seriously, LOL.  If you're a fan of mystery animes, then I recommend this to you.",

            "content": "Hmmm. This one is a tricky one. Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, is another psychological-type anime. If you know who I am, I've appeared on many supernatural, psychological animes. By 'many' I of course mean two. I've appeared on Death Note and Parasyte -the maxim-. Two very great animes. Don't get me wrong, I love Higurashi, I really do, but just not this one. This one isn't as great as Kai.\r\nFirst of all, Maebara Keiichi moves to a \"Peaceful village\" called Hinamizawa. If you noticed the quotes, it isn't really that peaceful. He finds himself beating the crap out of his two friends. I hopethat wasn't a spoiler. Because you see that in the first scene. I'll continue. Maebara Keiichi is just a simply teenage 16 year old that hangs out with utterly random people he just met.\\n\\n\r\nBut, as time proceeds, he finds out that his friends aren't as innocent as they claim to be. Keiichi ends up almost getting drugged, and beating the living shit out of the two girls that he had as friends. No, no! Don't write a fanfiction about it! God...\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the other thing to it is, a curse called Oyashiro-sama, or the curse of Oyashiro-sama, that's a better thing to call it, kills people every year for the fifth year in a row. This is set in 1980 sometin, I can't remember. But, people believe it to be the Oyashiro-sama curse that kills the people, but people suffer from something called the Hinamizawa Syndrome.\\n\\n\r\nThe Hinamizawa Syndrome is a deadly disease that causes people to commit suicide. I really hope that wasn't a spoiler. But, it's only if you get to a certain stage of the disease. I think it's like stage five or six or something like that. Eventually, you'll get to the point where you'll claw your own throat out. Yep. That can happen.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some funny moments in this anime, but most of the moments are dark and really, really messed up. I'm not going to explain the scenes in detail, but there is a lot of gore. Some people think the bad quality makes the anime scarier, but that makes no sense to me.\\n\\n\r\nNow... the quality of this show is kind of bad. The resolution isn't too great, the graphics are like... under the standard, but this was made in... the year 2006 or something? I don't know, someone can remind me. But, that would probably explain the bad quality. I know I'm going overboard with this quality stuff... BUT ITS FOCKIN' IMPORTANT, AIGHT MATEYS?\\n\\n\r\nAs I say in most of my reviews (Only have two), the soundtrack of the anime is amazing. I am a diehard fan over music, especially Japanese music. I don't often listen to English music, because I'm not into that type. Japanese music really stands out to me, the instruments, the vocals... It's all amazing. Higurashi no Naku Koro ni explains all those visuals in it's OST. It truly is magnificent.\\n\\n\r\nNow... for the characters... Eh, all the characters in this anime are all kinda fucked up, but whatever.\\n\\n\r\nMaebara Keiichi was transferred to Hinamizawa after a tragic accident in his other town. Eh, let me make up a name. Nothinamizawa. Perfect. So after being transferred from Nothinamizawa to Hinamizawa, he meets a group of \"friendly\" school girls that \"definitely\" do not want to harm him at all. Okay. Moving on. Did I explain enough? Did I mention he steals somebody's bat and beats the shi- okay moving on.\\n\\n\r\nSonozaki Mion and Shion are twins. But, you wont figure that out until the second or third arc. But, if you read this review, I don't even know if this is a spoiler, considering it's just revealing another character. But, Mion spends most of her time at home training to be the next Sonozaki head while Shion does... I don't know, stuff? However, Shion does not go to the same school as Keiichi and the others. Shion goes to a different school, somewhere else. Shion is also the older sister, although is mostly mistaken for the younger one for some reason I don't quite understand. Good enough information.\\n\\n\r\nHoujou Satoko, simple, blonde haired little girl that is completely innocent in every single Higurashi arc. Has never killed anyone in an arc. I'm going to keep the ongoing character summaries short, since I'm really tired at this moment.\\n\\n\r\nFurude Rika, blue hair, I think, then changes the color of her hair in season 2, little girl, little girl means over 1000 years old, that is actually the main character of the show. It may not seem like it at first, but Furude Rika is actually the main person of the show. In season 2. But, who cares.\\n\\n\r\nRYUUGUU RENA!!!\\n\\n\r\nRena is so awesome. I can't explain why I like Rena so much. Maybe it's because she's unique? I don't know, but she just is so... uh... kawaii? Nah, she's just so cute at times, and she often takes people home... that's a habit she has to get rid of, and anything cute she'll often want to take home. She's not really that innocent, but actually, she is. Sorry... I keep lying...\\n\\n\r\nAight. Enough with that. I don't really enjoy this season as much as the second one, but this season of Higurashi is still pretty good, considering it was the first season, and has bad graphics, oops, sorry. I gotta get away from the graphics section. But, other than that, it's really an amazing anime. I know, my overall for the anime is 7, but isn't that a good score? That's pretty good to me. Hope you enjoy the anime, as much as I did, if not, even more... or less. But I wouldn't want that. Neither would you.",

            "content": "This will be a spoiler free review, so feel free to read without fear. :)\r\nI'm going to break up what I have to say into 5 paragraphs.\r\nStory: Interesting story, unique, but be prepared to be almost completely lost for the most of it. It's done in little segments that, when viewed all together, tell different parts/versions of the same story. Hang in there, it is worth the watch.\r\nArt: You won't see much in the way of fancy graphics here. Everything will be fairly standard. One tone of shadow, nothing really mind blowing. That said the contrast between its goofy, almost innocent style of animation mixedwith its darker scenes was really quite the contrast, and gave things an edge I really enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Each character is fairly unique, different personality types with their own back-stories and motivations.... that said, why they do things don't always make sense, at least not to me. I won't spoil anything, so I'll point out the one thing that stood out the most to me without giving away any plot points. Shion has a gun... its in plain sight basically all the time, and it fits into the back story, thats all fine. BUT SHE NEVER USES IT! No one is ever like \"Hey, you're sixteen, why do you have a gun?\" Or \"Hey, that would be really useful to use right now.\" Which trust me, there are plenty of times it would have come in handy... but nope, it just sits there, every episode... taunting you with its uselessness. And at quite a few points in the story you are going to be like \"Oh he is definitely going to confront them about this... what?... he's just going to be passive aggressive and bitchy? They just tried to kill you!\" That said, the rest of the story makes up for this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If you don't mind gore and enjoy a dark story, then this is a good anime for you. If however you don't like to see violence against children in your fiction... well, I'd avoid it. The characters motivation make enough sense that it is watchable, and the story is solid. You could definitely do worse.",

            "content": "Higurashi no naku koro ni is probably the best written and thought through anime ever made. At a push, undoubtedly the best. Why? Not just because it is a blend of two of the hardest genres to make. Because it's different.\r\nStory:\r\nLike every other typical horror anime, they use high school to push things into the depths of misery and antics that happen within. Even with death note, mirai nikki and deadman wonderland, if high school wasn't the original setting the show never would've happened. Although Higurashi involves a school, it is nowhere near the level of high school and holds around 15 people of allages, and the show could've been good even without it. Is it set in a city? No. It's set in a peaceful and quiet village. It's the way that the writers have started from complete scratch and made something completely different that astounded me. I don't even need to get on how phenomenal the plot is and how brilliant and enjoyable it is. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNow let's just get across the fact that the animation isn't the greatest thing about this show. It's annoying watching ordinary talking scenes with complete out-of-proportion people, not going to lie about that. But with the hilarious faces and the moe parts, I got used to it and decided it was a good part about this show. It really outlined the torture scenes and made some of it hilarious and almost laugh-out-loud funny, so I'm going to give this a solid 8.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNow this is where this anime really shines. If i recall my sources correctly, this anime's OS was written by the genius Kenji Kawai, which is a culture change from his other work. Let's just say he delivered. It has the greatest depressing anime song of all time, and really added to some of the more neutral scenes, which is nice as in normal anime the background stuff of those scenes are neglected. It's a 9 for sound from me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis show has two of my top 5 characters. Rena, and Keiichi. Shion is at a push in my top ten, with Mion, Takano and Oishii all within my top 20. So, why is this so low? One word: Rika. Oh my god I absolutely hated her. How this stupid little space filler is just randomly assigned into this fortune-teller godly role. And she was also a total bitch at the best of times, and a rather large slacker. It would be 9, but since Rika occurred, it's an 8.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is self-explanatory. An obcious 10.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion? Don't need one. If you're thinking about watching it, just do it, no matter what genre.\\n\\n",

For myself, it was \"Higurashi no naku koro ni\", also known as \"When They Cry\". \r\nA very mature show, combined with mystery. The story it self is about a group of friends living in the rural mountain city, Hinamizawa. \r\nThey all attend the same school and enjoy playing board games, partaking in competitive challenges with one another, and attending the annual Watanagashi Festival. The long summer days for the five friends are care-free and innocent. \r\nUntil something goes terribly wrong...\r\nFor the past four years,on the cotton drifting festival, a gruesome series of deaths comes on this special night. \\n\r\nThe story of Higurashi takes place during the time of the fifth festival since these events began. \\n\\n\r\nFrom here, it's not your usual horror story. \\n\r\nThe story is retold differently with every story arc which presents a different view of the same events. The re-tellings are character-dependent which develops the characters and makes each story vary from one another to the point where even some of the facts of the case are called into question but nevertheless provides clues to the overall mystery. I suggest watching this one arc at a time so dedicate about two hours in the middle of the night, turn off the lights, and prepare to get creeped out.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is nothing extra ordinary, but that is certainly not required. \\n\r\nPutting this sweet look to the girls really helps developing their character, making the tension when the gruesome scenes happen even worse. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s been years since Higurashi was released and this anime remained one of the very, if not the most, important titles in horror anime circle. My rating seems quite trivial now because time has already proved this anime\u2019s quality and achievement.",

            "content": "[SPOILER WARNING]\r\nAmong all the genres and subgenres of anime I\u2019ve come across, none seems to have a worse reputation than the horror genre. While reputations vary from show to show, one series that consistently garnered good reviews and praise was the Higurashi series. \r\nThe Higurashi series started back in 2002 as a series of visual novel games on PC, with ports coming later to PS2, PS3, Playstation Vita, Nintendo DS, iOS, and Android. The first 4 games of the series (Onikakushi-hen, Watanagashi-hen, Tatarigoroshi-hen, and Himatsubushi-hen) made up the \u201cHigurashi no Naku Koro ni\u201d arc and told the story of Keiichi Maebara and his misadventures inthe fictional town of Hinamizawa.  Critical reception was very high for the series and due to the growing popularity, an anime adaptation as well as several manga that were also met with widespread critical and audience acclaim were released.\\n\\n\r\nWhat we\u2019ll be looking at today is the anime adaptation that aired during the Spring 2006 season and was produced by Geneon and Studio Deen, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. Is Higurashi a bright spot in the often bleak landscape of horror anime, or is it a product of a desperate audience praising a mediocre title? Let\u2019s dig in!\\n\r\n----------\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\n----------\\n\r\nWe\u2019ll start with the story. The story of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni revolves around, as stated previously, the misadventures of Keiichi Maebara and the lolicon guild in the fictional town of Hinamizawa. The story is cut into multiple arcs, which appear to be alternate realities where the events that take place often contradict each other, leaving the audience wondering what is real and what isn\u2019t real. I like the idea, really. For a psychological horror title, toying with the mind of the audience is always a plus. However, people seem to be ignoring all the terrible things that are contained within these arcs. \\n\\n\r\nFor starters, little girls are not scary. Ever. The Exorcist was the exception, and that was because the makeup and sound effects used on the actress was fantastic. In Higurashi, I honestly found it laughable. None of the characters are scary when they turn \u201cpossessed\u201d by the shrine demon. I always groaned or laughed whenever they resorted to it. Part of this is due to the frail nature of the characters (which I\u2019ll get to later), but in general the \u2018evil little girl\u2019 trope is awful, overused, and ineffective. If you want some examples, just take a look at feardotcom or Village of the Damned. Children are not intimidating or scary unless the execution is solid, and in Higurashi it is most certainly not.\\n\\n\r\nAnother big problem was the delivery of plot-crucial information. Generally speaking, in horror it is pretty much always a bad idea to resort to long drawn-out conversations to deliver exposition. To put it bluntly, the blatant exposition conversations between Keiichi and detective Ooishi are nothing short of painful. These scenes are boring, uninteresting, and treated with such sincerity that it\u2019s impossible to enjoy them. The director clearly intended us to be shocked or horrified by the information revealed, but honestly the delivery and execution was so terrible and dull that I couldn\u2019t care less about what they were talking about. \\n\\n\r\nOn the positive side, Higurash no Naku Koro ni is very solid tonally. It\u2019s unnerving and some of the ideas they play around with are very interesting. The idea of a shrine god wreaking havoc on people due to a dam project that will bury the shrine and town under water is actually pretty interesting, despite being done better in the movie Noroi: The Curse. It FEELS like a horror title. For Higurashi no Naku Koro ni being a hybrid slasher/paranormal entry, it is filled to the brim with the potential to be something great. The biggest problem here though is execution, and I\u2019m afraid Chiaki Kon butchered most of the potential the show had with awful execution and direction.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni gets a 4/10.\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nWith that, let\u2019s move on to the characters. The key players in Higurashi no Naku Koro ni are Keiichi Maebara, Rena Ryuuguu, Rika Furude, and Shion and Mion Sonozaki. There\u2019s nothing necessarily wrong with the characters, so much as they\u2019re burdened with terrible character designs and irritating comedy scenes that defy the tone of the show constantly. There is a genuine feeling of sympathy towards them at the end of the show though, as it becomes pretty clear that none of them have much malicious intent so much as the spirit of the shrine god is influencing them into committing violent and malevolent acts. Once you realize after that that the shrine god doesn\u2019t actually exist and it\u2019s some sort of virus that\u2019s doing it, you feel even less resentful towards the characters. The writers did a pretty great job at redeeming the characters\u2019 actions, and I feel that the characters are probably the strongest part of this show. It doesn\u2019t really explain though why the virus makes the characters into psychotic murderers, but I suppose I\u2019ll have to wait until Kai to get a detailed explanation on that.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni get a 7/10.\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\r\nMUSIC/SOUND:\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\r\nWhile there are huge problems with presentation in Higurashi, the music is not included among them. The music of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is honestly pretty great, and it evokes a wide array of emotions that fit the varying tones of the different arcs. I actually have a big thing for opening themes, and I really dig the opening theme of the show, \"Higurashi no Naku Koro ni\" by Eiko Shimamiya.  It\u2019s mellow, aggressive, violent, and ambient all at the same time, perfectly complementing the overall feel of the show. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the voice acting is abysmal, and I\u2019m not even talking about the dub. The Japanese voice acting in Higurashi is just awful. Outside of Yukari Tamura (Rika) and Satsuki Yukino (Mion and Shion), the acting for the main characters is highly questionable. While Soichiro Hoshi did a pretty mediocre yet acceptable job as Keiichi, Mai Nakahara (Rena) and Mika Kanai (Satoko) were absolutely horrible. Nakahara\u2019s performance as Rena was fairly uninspired, but the biggest offender overall is definitely Kanai. Kanai gives by far the worst performance in the entire show, and the result is some of the cheesiest voice acting I\u2019ve ever heard. You look me in the eyes and tell me you didn\u2019t laugh your ass off when Satoko freaked out in the classroom and kicked Keichii across the room. That hokey scream is still embedded in my mind a month after finishing the show, and pretty much encapsulates what\u2019s wrong with the vocal direction in general: it\u2019s too cheesy and impossible to take seriously.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, the sound department of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni gets a 5/10.\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION:\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nFinally, we arrive at the biggest problem with Higurashi: the art and animation. Putting it simply, the art and character designs in this show are complete and total garbage. The art-style itself looks like crap, and the entire experience is basically ruined because of it. First off, all of the main characters look like those toothpicks they use to hold sandwiches together. They\u2019re all incredibly thin and frail, and feature clich\u00e9 anime hairstyles with stupid colors like green and blue. I can\u2019t STAND it when animators do this, as it sucks me right out of the show.  \\n\\n\r\nI said earlier that I\u2019d talk more about why the character design make it impossible to be intimidated by any of the characters, and I\u2019ll talk about that now. Due to how frail and silly the characters look, I found it impossible to take any of them seriously when they started to act crazy. They\u2019re essentially all lolis, meaning we\u2019re basically supposed to be afraid of little girls yelling like maniacs while wielding giant knives. Yeah, I don\u2019t think so. Some deranged teenage girl isn\u2019t going to scare me, no matter how much the animators twist their face to try to make her scary. I\u2019ve seen far too many horror films and shows to be scared by something that dumb. On a positive note though, the gore was done pretty well and keeps the grave feeling of the story very much alive amid the bad artwork. \\n\\n\r\nAs for animation, it doesn\u2019t really fare well either. While it certainly looks fine, it\u2019s still plagued by the terrible art and as such I find it difficult to judge it without noticing the bad art. I guess you could call it average.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the art and animation for Higurashi no Naku Koro ni gets a 2/10.\\n\r\n---------------------------------\\n\r\nWHY YOU SHOULD WATCH:\\n\r\n---------------------------------\\n\r\nI refuse to grade for enjoyment. Instead, I will substitute it with this:\\n\r\nWatch Higurashi no Naku Koro ni if you enjoy horror that messes with your head, has good tone, and features tons of gore. Avoid if you don\u2019t like evil-acting children, bad art, or cheesy voice acting.\\n\r\n---------------------------------\\n\r\nAnd that just about sums up my feelings about Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. If you can\u2019t tell by now, I don\u2019t think this is anywhere near deserving of the praise and critical acclaim it\u2019s received. Being a huge horror fan since I was 13 and after seeing hundreds of horror films, I\u2019d say I have a pretty firm grasp on what constitutes good horror and bad horror, and unfortunately this falls slightly toward the bad side of the scale. The art is terrible, the voice acting is bad, the direction and execution is schlocky and stupid, and there are a lot of ideas that just weren\u2019t realized. However, it is somewhat unnerving and there are some genuinely creepy ideas in play here, so by no means would I say it\u2019s awful. It just falls a bit below average.\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro ni gets a 4/10.\\n\\n",

And then that OP plays and they know they're in trouble. I can gush about this series like the manchild I am that damn well watched every single piece of it that I could get my hands on. I love this fucking work of art.\r\nThe first scene of this season gives you just a minor taste of what's to come before you find yourself in the sleepy village of Hinamizawa. You canimagine the long summer days that never seem to end, the cicadas creating a cacophonous ambiance in rhythm with you and your friends playing, and the slight breeze now and then cooling you off as you wipe the beads of sweat from your forehead. It's perfectly perfect. And yet, something feels off. The Cotton Drifting Festival is just around the corner and every year it seems someone dies and someone disappears, thanks to a vengeful gods curse. But surely that can't be the case, can it?\\n\r\nThat's a picture I feel that is amazingly captured through the art, the sound design, and the character interactions within this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are fantastic and each character save for Keiichi, who has sadly been watered down to act as a viewer insert, have so much depth. The village and the history behind it feels alive. You will take your time and learn much about the characters, and you will have many questions. If you stick it out. You might just find your answers.\\n\\n\r\nThis first season was the only one dubbed in English, so if you want to try to keep continuity before moving on to the second season watch the subbed version.",

            "content": "If any of ya like creepypastas, this will be the perfect anime for you. Not only is it good cause it's a yandere anime (which are always good), but it's also because I feel like this is telling me a creepypasta in animation. If I tell you even just a little about the plot, I'm practically ruining the experience for ya, cause I know that google did by telling me who the yandere of Higurashi is.\r\nI just wanna talk about why I love Higurashi so much. Well I need to mention first that this anime just doesn't progress normally like others do. There are likethese arcs (I think there's six of em) that have maybe about 4 or 5 episodes in each(there's one that has six and another that has two). It's strange cause each arc(except for the two episode one) takes place around the same time and portrays the same events, but each arc might have a different protagonist so you could see what they do in the shadows while the other characters are doing what you saw in the previous arc. You'll get my point when you watch it. Anyway, why I love this anime:\\n\r\nGreat psychological horror\\n\r\nGreat regular horror(if that's a thing)\\n\r\nGood humor(when it's not being f***ed up)\\n\r\nVery emotional\\n\\n\r\nThis was my first horror anime, and I absolutely love it. The psychological horror is perfect. Honestly it is sooooo good I felt sympathy for all of the characters. This is better than your average horror anime, cause there actually is as many guts and gore as I thought. Regular horror anime relies too much on guts and gore and monsters(like corpse party), but in higurashi, they just do such a good job at expressing the characters feelings that you just want to step in there and help them(but you probably shouldn't). It's ironic, but I find this anime just as sad as gorey. This was actually the anime I probably felt the saddest when watching, but I haven't watched a truly sad anime yet(I'm planning to watch Angel Beats in the future). The regular anime horror is also gruesome(poor Satako).\\n\\n\r\nNext is the characters. You got Keiichi the main character for the first three arcs. He ain't that unique, but it's not really the characters that stand out. Also Rena whose voice sounds like Rin Tohsaka(they're voiced by the same actor). Satako and Rika are just adorable lolies. And then there's Shion and Mion. Mion is mostly just your typical tomboy, but Shion, well, watch it for yourself. These characters all have their psycho moments which is when it gets really interesting.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I close up, I just want to point one thing out, I watched it dubbed, on purpose. Now I know you all must be going like \"WHAT, why would ya do that you baka.\" Let me explain, first I like dub better than sub. Sub ain't bad, but dub in my opinion is better. And also, I honestly don't know why it's bad. It sounded ok to me. The voice acting was alright. There were some high pitched voices and that Rena sounded like Rin Tohsaka, but I didn't mind. It certainly sounds better than the high pitched voices in sub anime. I actually wished that they would've continued to dub Higurashi. For me, it's sad that only the first season is dubbed, but watch it in whatever translation you want.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, hell yeah go watch this f***ed up anime cause it's awesome. I guess I should talk about the art style, it's adorable, but that's why it's better, cause I don't want a mature looking art style in this anime. Actually even if you have a weak stomach, but still want to see some psychological horror, well you can still watch it, but you might miss some important information. You know what don't watch it if you have a weak stomach, but if you don't yeah sure watch it. If you love creepypastas, yeah this should be the first anime you watch right now.",

I feel like my review would have been fine if it was just the first line. it's my personal review of the show, i'm not gonna write an essay or a documentary about every little bit of the show. I'm not a famous critic. Fuck character minimums.\\n\\n\r\nBut seriously this show is great i definitely recommend it it gets my rating of watch it with a group of people so you can make fun of each other's bull shit theories ok bye",

            "content": "*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\r\n*My first review, be gentle*\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThis anime in a nutshell is a murder mystery divided into Arcs that plays threw one of the main character's individual story in a the month of June. These arcs can be seen like a visual novel so to say.  Each of the MC's (Main characters) Arcs astray slightly different then the others but are crucial to the story and unveiling the key to why the murders are happening in Hinamizawa. In Hinamizawa there is a Parasite that causes people to get berserked if the person is too stressed out. These Arcs revolve around the MC'sperspective and give subtle clues on how the MC becomes too stressed out and goes berserk in the first place! Many do not know of this virus like parasite and just refer to it as Oyashiro's curse. The villagers are left in the dark not knowing the true reason why people go insane since the parasite is kept secret for political and safety reasons. Once the MC is too stressed out they lose their ability to think rationally this disease makes it so that they hallucinate and their fears can truly become a reality! Once inflicted with the ailment they cannot think rationally and have auditory/visual hallucinations. At this stage the MC can't differentiate friend from foe, and usually ends up murdering someone then dying. You learn watching this anime that the character Arcs in the revolve around the current MC's downfall and lets you try to pinpoint the event that eventually triggers why the MC gets berserked in the first place! This is one of those anime you want to watch again and again because you pick up more subtle information each time you watch it..!\\n\\n\r\nI cannot stress enough that this was very well thought out, a lot can happen in *one* month ;)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nIts all right, nothing too visually stunning, and it doesn't have to be.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10: - The creators deeply grounded the atmosphere with this one..! Most opening / closings OSTs I don't really care for, but I can rewatch/listen to these until forever. The sound/OSTs played during the anime are well synchronized and not out of place. This really captures the moment of suspense. The normal sound/music isn't bad either, it can be very upbeat and cheery when the main group do their day to day activities.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nEasily a 10/10 because how the anime is presented like a visual novel. During the Arcs you learn so much about the current MC. This makes the characters seemingly flawless because of how heavy one an Arc revolves around one person. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 \\n\r\nI personally love it for all the reasons above. I lost count of how many times I've rewatched this. Highly recommend. \\n",

How insane the characters in this anime truly are? Or should I just ask why isn't Rika my daughter yet(This anime has the most adorable girl ever)? If you are a fan of horror anime then why haven't you watched this yet? I have always loved the whole horror genre so this anime was so amazing to me. Most horror anime just didn't do it for me. I went in to horror anime thinking I was gonna see something likeThe Ring or The Grudge in anime form. I was disappointed with horror anime for the most part until I finally came across Higurashi. The feeling you get from watching this anime is so dark and perfect. Don't even get me started on the opening. The opening is great, the vocals fit in so perfectly with the visuals giving you a brief glimpse of the dread and insanity you are about to experience. Now if you cant stand gore stay away from this anime. It has some of the most messed up scenes I've ever seen in anime. The characters are memorable. All of them having a very good amount of screen time giving you enough to get attached to. The art is a turn off for some people but I think the art made the anime even better. The faces of the characters in the insane moments have so much feeling in them. You see how insane they are just by looking at their faces. If you like gore, horror, and/or psychological anime give Higurashi a shot.",

            "content": "Cute girls killing each other. That's what Higurashi is, and it is awesome.\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro ni tells the tale of a group of ordinary high school students who live their happy lifes together in their weird little club in this little town. However, everything is not what it seems in this little town. Every year, one person dies and another person disappears on the night of the Cotton Drifting Festival. Villagers blame it on the curse of the town's local deity, Oyashiro-sama. And so, the group of high school students find their lives intertwined somehow with these events. \r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro ni hasa very interesting format. Every arc starts out all happy until the characters go all insane. Then once the stories wrapped up in four episodes or so, everything resets and we get another story involving the same characters, but different things happen. This allows us to see different sides of all of the characters and how they react to different situations, allowing us to get a deeper understanding of them that greatly adds to the show. The format also helps as when an arc ends, you really want to know what happens next and who's going to go crazy next arc (as a lot of people go crazy on this show, trust me). And so that adds to Higurashi no Naku Koro ni's experience and makes it such an addicting, show.\\n\\n\r\nAnd really, this show is so addicting. While I didn't find Higurashi no Naku Koro ni to be scary at all, I did love the suspense. While episodes do not always end with cliffhangers (there's very few actually) due to the mystery of the show, you need to watch another episode so you can try to figure out what's going on. The events that happen to the characters in the show are horrific and you truly pity them, even the ones who go absolutely insane. And while this season doesn't tie up all loose ends (the equal Kai, which I haven't seen but will very soon), it still ends well enough that even without a season two, it's just a really melancholy conclusion instead of a mess like other shows do. \\n\\n\r\nThe best part of Higurashi are the characters. While at first glance they seem like your normal harem stereotypes such as the dull harem lead, the moe girl who likes cute things, the tomboy, the moe loli, and the tomboy loli, they are not. All of the characters have hidden sides, almost like split personalities, inside of them. No one in this show is how they seem upfront, and finding out the character's true sides is part of the fun of the show. However, having characters with personalities that can change with a drop of the hat does mean that they can be however the story wants them to be with no pattern. While it does typically come off more as cool than lazy, I can see this angering some. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now let's talk about the animation. Ah, the animation. To put it simply, Higurashi is one of the most badly animated anime I've seen. While it isn't the worst, it does come really really close at times. Characters almost never look on-model, people do not move when they talk, and their faces are commonly hidden. They always make these really silly faces that are supposed to be scary, but they are not, they are silly. Faces are covered in shadows often, and don't even get me started on the fight scene in the last episode. While Higurashi is not an action anime and good animation isn't necessary, there was more than one time where I thought that if Studio DEEN had just a little more budget, the scene would be more awesome. \\n\\n\r\nFortunately the soundtrack fairs much better. The opening theme is haunting and fits the mood of the show perfectly, with a slow-paced ending with haunting Engrish lyrics. The background music, while it doesn't have any standout tracks, does fit the show perfectly and adds to the tension. However, these voice actors are awesome. While they do sound average when the characters are normal, when the characters go insane, they just sound so perfect with some of the best acting I've seen in an anime and they really make their characters more believable. \\n\\n\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro ni is an addicting anime, and once you start watching you cannot stop. I recommend it to any anime fan.",

            "content": "I'm going to keep this review very short. No thorough analysis of each section, just my overall opinion and mood after finishing this series.\r\nNow, before you start hating me for giving this popular series only a 7, hear me out. When I first heard this series was a psychological horror involving cute, little girls, I was pretty perplexed. So, I started watching it and the first story arc completely blew my mind. I had no idea someone could warp such a nice little group of people into a bunch of maniacal assholes. Then, as the series progressed, each story arc had a little less impactthan the last. The scary aspect became very repetetive and I felt like just turning off my TV and actually going to work. All these random story arcs confused me, but the ending did clear some things up. Sadly, the payoff just wasn't worth it in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nIn my honest opinion, the random story arcs were not really necessary. They could have just followed the first arc and continue the story with other characters who were alive. I didn't see the need to piece together all these progressively unamusing arcs and expect you to figure shit out like a detective. I'm not saying I wouldn't have enjoyed a little mystery solving, but I don't have the attention span to watch a series that \"resets\" every 4 or so episodes.\\n\\n\r\nYou ever see the Twilight Zone? That was one of the best TV shows ever. It created a mood of suspense, horror, and mystery that left you sweating and sometimes disturbed. They did all that under 30 minutes. It kept you guessing, prodding the plot, and made you scared or at least mildly disturbed.  I'm know I'm rambling on here, but if a show can do all that in less than 30 minutes, why can't this one do it across the span of 26 24 minute episodes?",

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\nYou don't find a lot of horror anime out there. I mean yes, you could point to shows like Another, the currently airing Tokyo Ghoul, or even though I haven't found the time to see it yet, I hear Monster is absolutely fantastic show. But the fact remains that horror anime are few and far between, and this is because of the disconnect of animation and real life. I touched on this in my Coraline review, but in anime, the very style of animation instantly separates the viewer from what's going on, unlike in a movie, and thus it's a lotharder to actually scare anybody watching. To be truly frightening, an anime needs to be damn good at what it does. Higurashi no koro ni is an anime that is almost unique in the ways that is plays with your expectations, keeps you in the dark of what's actually going on pretty much the entire time, and by the end of the first season, completely warps your views on everything that has happened beforehand. It'll leave you clues yes, maybe giving you hope that you will be able to wrap your head around what the hell is going on, before doing a 180 degree turn and using what you thought were hints to screw with your head. But it's also a show, that when you reach the end of it all, and take a step back for a moment or two, thinking about everything that the anime has told you, you realize that (almost)everything makes complete sense.\\n\\n\r\n     Hello people of \"The Wired\", my name is Quan, and I hope you're doing lovely on this first day of August, 2014. Today, we will be looking at the horror mystery mindf*ck, Higurashi no naku koro ni, or if you prefer the unfortunate English title: When They Cry. Before we get started, I'd like to point out that while I'm not technically spoiling anything in this review, if you're the kind of person who likes to know nothing about a show before you watch it, you should close this review now. It's like if you went into Madoka Magica not knowing the true nature of the show. If you knew what it was like before you watched it, a certain surprise might not have as much impact if you hadn't known what you where getting into. Now, if you don't know a certain \"twist\" of this show, one that is made quite clear by the end of episode 4, I'd say stop reading and go watch Higurashi, you'll be even more confused and intrigued then you would usually. However, if you are aware of the unusual way Higurashi tells its story, that's fine, nothing else will be spoiled in this review. Now with that, let's get started with this review.\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi aired its 26 episodes through the April and September of 2006 and was produced by the people over at Studio Deen, who haven't exactly been one of the forerunners of animation as of late. They've been around since the 1980's, but really, there's not a lot of their works you can point at and say: \"that was a good anime\", and looking down the list of shows they've created, I'd say Higurashi is still their strongest work. However, they were responsible for the original Fate/stay night anime, the semi-popular offbeat harem series Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? and of course, who can forgot the recently aired, and let's be fair, disaster that was Pupa.\\n\\n\r\n     Higurashi was directed by Chiaki Kon, who again, really hasn't been involved in a lot of notable works, though get this, she directed the romance anime Golden Time, which you know, really couldn't be any more opposite than Higurashi, so I'll give her points for range I suppose. She also directed some yaoi for some reason. Huh. The script was handled by Rika Nakase, who like her director, seems a little hit and miss. While she did work on the script for Bleach(though she was one of like 6 to do that), the rest of her works are very forgettable or anime that I've just never heard of. Now with that technical shenanigans out of the way, let me try to explain just what the plot of Higurashi no naku koro ni revolves around.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a new start for teenager Maebara Keiichi. He's moved into the quiet little town of Hinamizawa, a town so small that there's only one school, with only one classroom, made up of all the town's children. He quickly makes a number of friends and joins their small club: who include the chipper and happy girl Rena Ryuugu, the club leader Mion Sonozaki, the young mischievous Satoko, and the mysterious Rika Furude. For a short time, things are peaceful for Keiichi, he hangs out every day at the club room and plays cards with his friends, but things aren't quite what they seem in the small town. Keiichi learns from a woman named Takano that a sinister curse lies over the town: The Curse of Oyashiro-sama, which decrees that every year around the time of the town's annual Cotton Drifting Festival, one person will be found murdered, and one person will just disappear all together. It is a time of mass paranoia for the town, and while Keiichi tries to find out more, his new friends seem to be unwilling to talk about it, and are growing slowly more strange and detached, as if they know something they don't want Keiichi to find out. Keiichi tries to unravel the secrets of the town and his friends, but as Oyashiro-sama's curse descends, and events play out, by the end of it, nearly every one of our main characters is dead. Yes, that's right, by the end of episode 4, everyone is basically dead, from Rena, to Mion, and even Keiichi is found with his throat scratched out.\\n\\n\r\n     Now you might think this is a massive spoiler, but here is where Higurashi springs a little of a chin-scratcher. Come episode 5, suddenly, everyone is alive again, and the Cotton Drifting Festival is still a few days away. And this is where the intrigue starts setting in. Yes, Higurashi follows an arc format, but by the end of every arc, everyone is dead. Maybe by different means, maybe a because a different character went insane, and maybe in a different order, but once the one \"constant\" in each arc: The Cotton Drifting Festival, occurs, you know that nearly every one of the characters is going to slaughter each-other. And of course, you the viewer have absolutely no idea why or how.\\n\\n\r\n     And this is where the brilliance of Higurashi's story-telling starts to set in. Every arc just leaves enough clues and hints about what might be going in the bigger picture of things to keep you interested, but you don't even if there's a bigger picture, since the show never really tells you if these arcs are even connected at first. For most of the show, its left up to the viewer to piece together all the clues and hints the show leaves you, and try to determine who or what is causing the inhabitants of Hinamizawa to start going crazy. Yes, for most of the show, you have no idea, but eventually, it will all start coming together, and I promise during a certain scene in season 2, you will have that \"Oh snap!\" moment, as everything falls into place. Oh, did I not mention that? Yes, while I'm just reviewing the first season of Higurashi in this review, there is a second season titled Higurashi no naku koro ni kai, where they actually start telling you what the hell is going on. This makes the second season extremely important, 'cause while it might not be as good as the first season(I'll review it at a later date), it's pretty much the only way you'll be able to solve the mystery. Yes, season 1 does have a little climax of its own, where they do give a vital piece of information to solve the mystery, but nothing is really concluded, and it's pretty much left to you to watch season 2, and understand the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I love about Higurashi's cast is just how much they are more then first meets the eye. They all hold some sort of psychological damage, whether it be from abuse, to extreme family issues, to just being born completely crazy. Of course, before the Cotton Drifting Festival, they are able to disguise and hide their own individuals forms of trauma, but of course, Oyashiro-sama's curse is the perfect way to drive out the worst of all of them. It becomes an interesting way to learn more about the characters, and of course, what their role is in this grand mystery, because nearly every character takes their turn to go insane, depending on the arc. Rena's arc at the end, and of course Mion's arcs are the best example of this, from being either mind-boggling or kind of epic. It's something to keep in mind when watching Higurashi, almost every character you meet probably has much more grand importance in the \"bigger picture\" than you'd think. Even our \"main character\" Keiichi, who seems at first a typical bland protagonist, is hiding a dark past from his new friends. Though if I had had to choose a standout, I would say, of course not being dramatic, that Rena Ryuugu is pretty the most awesome character that has ever existed. Yeah, she might seem like a happy cute girl at first, but just wait she gets a cleaver in her hands, it's freakin' awesome. But yeah, besides from that, you might noticing I'm kind of avoiding character descriptions here. Well, I don't want to spoil more than I already have, so I'll let you experience this group of psychopaths for yourself, and get to know them well, since almost all character development for the characters stops once you hit season 2(again I review that eventually).\\n\\n\r\nTurning to animation, this is probably be the show's biggest weakness right here. I'm not going to sugar-coat it, the animation is pretty bad, or at the best of times very average. Now, I suppose you could blame this on the year being 2006, but hell, if you look at Fate/stay night, which Studio Deen did only a year earlier, that show seems much more polished then Higurashi. Higurashi's animation suffers from a painfully limited color palette; everything in the show looks really bland and basic, and it might have been OK if the show had at least stayed at the quality where it was, but we don't even get that. During the final arc, it becomes painfully obvious that the budget is getting a little bit tight, so the fight scene we get at the end, no matter how awesome it is conceptually wise, suffers from the really quite poor animation. Also, I'm sorry, but I hate the character designs. They never look like they fit into the world quite right to me, especially with Rika's design, which never fails to make me wince every time I need to look at it. I know this is more personal preference, and is not so much Studio Deen's fault as it is the original visual novel that the anime was based off of, but it really bothers me either way. This faulty animation could potentially ruin the experience of a scary or psychological scene, but I think the anime is directed well enough to make you forgot about the animation and just concentrate on the massacre unfolding before you. I've said this before, but quality of animation isn't necessary important when the story and characters are good enough, and this anime is a perfect example of this, but in the cheerful parts of the anime before the Cotton Drifting Festival where nothing much is happening, it does become rather hard to ignore. If you can look past it, that's great, if you get hung up on it, it might take away from some of the psychological scenes.\\n\\n\r\n     However, the one thing I really do like about the animation is something that's become known as the \"Higurashi face\". This is when the features of a character's face become extremely exaggerated and the eyes widen in moments of either madness or pain, and I must say, it's very effective, especially when coupled with the crazy laugh the characters do occasionally. It's the contrast when characters who have been nice and cheerful up till now have their face contort like this is what makes the face so creepy and memorable. A really cool feature, and one that only ramps up the fright level in certain scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Higurashi was produced by the superb Kenji Kawai, who for a change, seems to have a number of notable works under his belt. He did the music for Eden of The East, the original Fate/stay night, and the currently airing anime Barakamon, which even though I haven't seen, everybody seems to agree is pretty damn good. This means that unlike some other people who worked on Higurashi, I've got quite a bit of expectation for him and I'm delighted to say he fulfills it. While not many standout tracks are here, the quite large OST is filled to the brim with delightfully creepy and catchy atmospheric music. Of course, you've got the typical slice-of-life jingles there for the the fun bits of the series, but those are necessary after all. Yes, the sound-track isn't particularly memorable, per say, unlike some other works by Kawai, but the music is mostly there to really build tension and make your skin crawl during scenes rather then being listened to on your musical device, and I am perfectly fine with that. Also we need to talk about the opening for the series, because damn is it good. The creepy chanting fits the off-putting atmosphere of the series perfectly, along with the schizophrenic visuals that are colorful, surreal and frightening at the same time. It's no doubt the best part of the OST.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow I usually don't talk about subs and dubs in my reviews, but for Higurashi I'll make an exception, because the dub is truly awful. No, I'm not a purist, I'm willing to watch a show dub or sub, it really depends on what I watch first. There are some dubs better than their sub counter-parts, like Baccano! or Cowboy Bebop or arguably Gankutsuou, and Higurashi's sub is simply much better. The dub really feels forced by all the actors, and the mad laughs they do or nowhere near as good as in the Japanese version. So yeah, that's just a little footnote, when you go watch the show, find the sub version. \\n\\n\r\nWith that, I shall bring this review of Higurashi no naku koro ni to an end. Now, keep in mind, the opinions I gave and the rating I will give remain solely for the first season of the show. Higurashi no naku koro ni kai will get a review at some point; I couldn't just bundle the two seasons together judging from just how different they really are. So yeah, if you've been repeatedly frustrated by the lack of good horror anime out there, look no further than Higurashi. The first season is an awesome mind-boggling experience form beginning to end, and while the second season does have its problems, it ties up the mystery fairly nicely. Just keep your mind on its toes, and never trust anything the anime tells you, because its definitely going to be turned on its head by the end of the show. It's not for the faint of heart, but if you can stand a little blood and gore, give it try late at night, when the lights are off, and preferably when you're high on caffeine. You never know, it might just scratch that horror itch. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nP.S: So there was nothing wrong with the lunch?\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog!

            "content": "This anime is a personal favorite of mine for many reasons most of all for the way they use horror. They introduce you to a bunch of characters all very likeable and each have their own qualities that make each other unique from one another and then toss those characters into some crazy bullshit. Whether it has something to do with murders, paranoia, or situations your not sure what's happening at all. Its extremely enjoyable to see the fucked up things that happen to them and watch as the story reveals itself. There are moments that actually caught me off guard and left me sayingoh shit out of how fucked up some moments could be. The story also is told in an EXTREMELY confusing way in the first season, its made up of many different arcs knows as question arcs and answer arcs and at the beginning of each one you are guaranteed to say what the fuck is going on. If you're into a good horror/psychological anime I definitely recommend this one. I wont talk about too many details that way you can be completely oblivious going into it. Enjoy! and if you have an comments or questions please let me know! also watch season 2 Higurashi no naku koro ni kai!",

            "content": "I enjoyed this anime, there where things I wish it had done differently but for the most part I understand why they did the things they did and I'm able to enjoy this series.\r\nStory:\r\nI enjoy the way they went about telling the story for the most part. I don't like the constant rehash of the same information (I don't want my anime to hand hold me) but higurashi didn't try to explain to much of the plot. I was annoyed that every other episode I relearned about the curse and it's victims but as the series progressed they went into less and less detail andit seemed as if they were spending less time explaining it so it's a minor complaint and if you pace out the episodes you yourself may consider it much less annoying than I did. Overall I find the plot enjoyable. It's rather simple but not dumb and sometimes I like not thinking to hard anyways. I would like to note that this feels more like an introduction to the world in order to explain and advance the story in a way that makes the viewer more interested in the characters than the complete story and I believe the sequel goes about resolving the actual conflict. I cannot say for sure because I have not seen the sequel but everything points towards that being the case. Non the less I consider every episode necessary and so I don't mind personally the way they did things.  \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis series has fairly decent art work I suppose but I must admit that I've never been to picky about the general appearance of my anime. I'd like to note that the anime was not as gory as I expected it to be, although it had a couple moments there were only a few of them and they were tamer than I was expecting. Still this anime isn't about trying to give it's viewers a cheap thrill, rather it's more about mood, so I found it appropriate.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening was better than I thought it was going to be and I really enjoyed it. other than that everything felt right but nothing else seemed to stand out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI'll admit I didn't like the characters at first. I found them annoying and dull, but every arch seemed to be focused on one character and as time went on I even found myself picking favorites. The character development managed to make me change my mind about everyone over and over again but in the end also managed to find a way to make me understand there motives and feelings and even sometimes care about them. Now having finished the show I can say with certainty that I  like all the characters, even rena who I found to be the most annoying for quite awhile.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime and while no anime is perfect this one was very good in my opinion. and since 8 means very good on this site I can say that the number 8 even if it doesn't sum up all of higurashi, perfectly sums up how much I enjoyed this series.\\n\\n\r\nI'm happy to say that I see myself honestly recommending this to someone in the future and for me this anime was better than decent but not quite great.",

            "content": "When I first heard of Higurashi, I was overjoyed to think that such a thing could exist. The first thing I ever saw of it was the fingernail removal torture scene and frankly, I thought it looked awesome. I love horror and gore and torture - torture porn horror movies with more blood than plot are one of my favourite things. But no matter how many psychos or scratched out necks or mutilated corpses showed up in this anime... it never got good. Not once.\r\nStory - 1:\r\nThis story starts off pretty simple. A young boy called Maebara Keiichi moves to a new town. It's small,with a school that literally just stuffs all the kids in one class because there's too few for year groups, and he consequently makes female friends of different ages (fuck knows where all the guys are in this anime - he even joins a baseball team at one point and manages to make no male friends) who he goes on stupid cheery picnics with. At first, I thought this wasn't too bad. But I quickly became incredibly confused and simultaneously frustrated.\\n\\n\r\nThe first problem with this anime is the layout. It's presented in these really stupid arcs that last a few episodes, and are mostly dull and predictable. The aim and potential of these arcs is clear - they wanted to show all the sides of a mystery and reveal different details with each storyline. But these storylines were ridiculous. They all deviated so far from each other that I could barely recognise that they were meant to be connected. It was like the writer was trying to write plots and just gave up half-way through with a sigh and started another. There's nothing clever about this anime. There's nothing mysterious about this anime. It's just confusing and convoluted and ridiculous - characters completely change personality between arcs, and nothing really make sense and the ending - oh god, the ending!\\n\\n\r\nI can honestly say I have never hated an anime ending more than the ending of this anime. I made such an effort to force myself to the end of this 26 episode anime only to find that it wasn't worth it. It was never worth it. It was the biggest waste of time storyline I've ever attempted to follow. That ending was so ridiculous and answered no questions. I was appalled, frankly, that I'd allowed myself to sit through it. It's awful.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 3:\\n\r\nThis anime's art feels so low quality throughout. 2006 isn't that long ago, but animes even older than that do a better job at art than this does. The character designs are bland and unattractive, the backgrounds are no sort of breakthrough, and the colours were dull with only splatterings of blood diverting your attention from the apparent lack of effort put into the animation. Really, this anime's art is nothing you'd call pretty. It's mediocre at best.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 3:\\n\r\nThis anime is yet another that suffers from what I like to call \"does Japan really sound like that?\" syndrome. These weird shrieking insects constantly sound whenever anyone is outside like nails on a chalkboard, although this is hardly something only Higurashi suffers from. I can only assume these are the cicadas that the anime's title refers to (which I only learnt were bugs from watching Haruhi Suzumiya) but Jesus Christ - they surely can't honestly be that loud?\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, the voice acting here was mostly mediocre in the Japanese dub but for the love of God, do not under any circumstances approach the English dub. I have watched some frankly atrocious dubs (particularly when I first watched Higurashi, since I hadn't been watching anime for long and still struggled to read subs and catch all the action) but I couldn't watch this anime's English dub past the first episode. More blood spewed from my tear ducts in those first 20-odd minutes than out of any character in the entire anime. The only dub of this I was impressed with was the French dub, so if you speak French then try that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 1:\\n\r\nOh, dear. The characters of Higurashi. Where, exactly, do I begin? Perhaps with our main character, the idiot that he is. Despite the anime trying to reinforce that Keiichi is smart, he does the stupid thing at every turn. He's the male equivalent of big breasted female running up the stairs which, although I'm used to as a horror fan, could simply not abide to see in a guy that was straight up supposed to be this bright puzzle solver. He was a fucking moron.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, this anime is dripping in infuriating lolis. They tend to go psychotic every arc or so, which was predictable and sigh-worthy. Nothing about the apparent villainy of these young girls felt realistic. It felt bratty. There was nothing creepy about them - it was like they all just threw a tantrum with a knife in their hands. All these characters ever did was scream and shout and kick and then stab things. They were irritating even before this, with their obnoxious giggles and ridiculous games. They just plain aren't likeable, and their personalities were mostly dull as all hell.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 2:\\n\r\nThis anime is not fun. It is a drag, plain and simple. It is painful to force yourself through, with little in the way of interesting plot points and characters. You become pleased to find their lives are awful because, frankly, they deserve that shit for putting you through this despicable piece of crud they call an anime. You won't laugh. You won't cry. You won't even be that disgusted, because the horror itself is lame. This anime isn't scary or creepy or suspenseful. You don't care if the characters die because they'll all be back in an episode or two to infuriate you again. In fact, I challenge you to attempt to care about the characters full stop. Maybe if they actually became good villains and were entertaining in that respect, I'd have actually enjoyed this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI mean don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that horror is a good genre. I enjoy horror, but the genre itself is awful. You are more likely to find something awful than something good, but at least a lot of the bad shit is at least entertaining in its ridiculous grotesqueness. This is not the case with Higurashi. Higurashi is plain unenjoyable from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 1:\\n\r\nPathetic, appalling, however MAL wants to describe the 1/10 rating... it's right. Frankly, no matter how hard I try, I can't see a reason why you would like this anime. There are animes I hate where I at least understand some semblance of an appeal in their grotesqueness. Heck, there are animes I myself enjoy that other people would say are awful. But this anime, in all truth, is a waste of time. It does not deserve a 10 rating. It does not deserve a 9 rating. You are welcome to give it one and enjoy it, by all means, but I will never understand your motive or reasoning. You are giving this anime more credit than this overrated jockstrap will ever need and the fact that it has such a high average on MAL is, more than anything, shocking.\\n\\n\r\nPlease, if you ever listen to anything I say, do not watch Higurashi.\\n\r\nDo not waste your time on this anime.\\n\r\nDon't even open the streaming link.\\n\r\nDon't type the name into Google.\\n\r\nDon't put it on your to watch list.\\n\r\nTurn back.\\n\r\nTurn back now.\\n\r\nIt's too late for me, alas, yet there is still hope for you.",

            "content": "Welcome to Happy Tree Friends Anime version!!\r\nHigurashi is, up to now, the very best Anime I have ever seen, along with its second season, kai, but we will talk about this one.\r\nAs you may have heard, higurashi is a psychological horror anime. This means it plays with your mind more than it does with your capability of holding your puke. And I really mean this. The gore of this anime is intense, but it's so well executed that you won't even realize due to the complexity of the plot progress.\r\nStory: 10\r\nThe story follows this group of kids who live in a small town called Hinamizawa,and holy crap, a lot of stuff has happened in Hinamizawa before you arrived. The main focus of the plot is around a curse that makes people kill themselves. I will say nothing more, so you can watch it for yourself :D\\n\\n\r\nI will warn you right away, that this anime uses the so called \"Omnibus format\", which takes several stories and connects them through something they have in common, building a unique one from them (See Amagami SS). However, this format has its reason to be in the context of the anime. You will catch it when the time comes, and if you watch the second season, it will be even better.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of this anime manages to capture the atmosphere of a rural area, as well as the scenarios and \"camera\" angles are perfect for most of the horrorific and comedy moments as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe weak point of the art is without a doubt, the character design, it is kinda clumsy and some of the scary moments are ruined due to some of the expressions and the way they are built. However, this is not enough to take the atmosphere away completely. Some people I've shown this anime get scared even more because of them. I think it's a personal standards thing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe anime constantly plays crying grasshoppers at different dynamic volumes, to kinda set the pace and atmosphere to what's happening. I think it's kind of a narration or suspense-building thing. Even the background music steps back then the Grasshoppers are crying. Pay special attention to these moments. Speaking of background music, i thought it was awesome. It builds up a lot of suspense when it must, intensifies happy and comedy moments and every other aspect is covered. Basically what it should be.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is good, although some comedy moments felt forced through the characters voices.\\n\\n\r\nAs you may have read on my other reviews, i skip the Opening and Endings. I don't really care about them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nThrough all the Higurashi journey (and this also counts the 2nd season), these characters are shown to spend through a lot, in many different ways. They are also shown to have many diferent sides of their personalities, and not even the most \"experienced\" one shows to have \"no emotions\" nor is inexpressive either. It is really wonderful to see all these characters go through a lot, and watching the respective reactions to the different situations they are put into every time is just priceless; and executed in a way that you may not have seen before (or will ever again).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is simply outstanding and I absolutely recommend it to anyone that has not watched it. It really has a way to have you hooked, entertained, scared and curious all the time. You will feel like there are questions unanswered, but give it time. When you finish this, watch the second season until the end and you will be truly satisfied.\\n\r\nDamn! I even want to watch this all over again for the 3rd time Lol.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nI really don't have words for this.

            "content": "Higurashi is an anime that I initially thought would be nothing more than loli\u2019s killing stuff. Cute, adorable characters do cute, adorable things but secretly harbor murderous intent. If that had been the plot of Higurashi, it would have probably sucked pretty bad. Thankfully, Higurashi is a lot more complex than that, and while the loli killers are definitely the selling point of the anime and the main draw, what you will ultimately be sucked in by is the plot more so than the characters. And admittedly, I was going to drop Higurashi about halfway through as I couldn\u2019t understand what the hell was takingplace, nor did I really care at all for any of the characters. Thankfully, I stuck with it because while the series is very confusing and the drama and violence is pretty low-key for much of the series, the final two arcs really rectify everything with very satisfying drama, torture, and bloodshed.\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi is not so much the story of a group of characters, more so the story of the small town of Hinamizawa. Five years previous to when Maebara Keiichi joins the town\u2019s population, a dam construction project was going to take place. It would wipe out the entire town, so of course there was resistance to it. At some point during the resistance people died and the dam project was scrapped. It was during a town festival, Watanagashi, that this happened, and for every Watanagashi since people have died. It\u2019s in groups of two, where one person is killed and the other is \u201cdemoned away\u201d; basically he or she disappears.\\n\\n\r\nMaebara Keiichi seems to be the main character of Higurashi. He\u2019s new to the town and ends up making friends with some of the girls in his class; Rena, Mion, Satoko, and Rika. Each has a pretty harsh past and one in particular is very involved in the goings on of the town. That said, I can\u2019t really tell you a lot about what happens in Higurashi without spoiling anything. Suffice it to say, these girls are all caught up in what is considered \u201cOyashiro\u2019s Curse\u201d, the two deaths that happen during the Watanagashi festival, and Keiichi is caught in the middle of family feuds, crimes of passion, and much more.\\n\\n\r\nAs I stated, the series doesn\u2019t really pick up steam until the final two acts. It is divided into quite a few arcs, all of which are self-contained to an extent and focus on a different character. The story is tough to follow because of these different arcs overlapping, and sometimes being negated by the next arc. It\u2019s very mysterious and sometimes tough to get through because you have no idea what the hell you\u2019re watching and what to believe. Higurashi explains a lot of what is going on toward the end with an amazingly well-done arc concerning Mion\u2019s twin, Shion. Shion becomes the most memorable character in the anime through this arc, as well as produces the best drama in the entire show. Further explanation is given in the final arc, though I can safely say that not a lot is resolved and there are a lot of questions left unanswered, though you can probably make a few inferences for yourself on what\u2019s happening.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, as far as gore and violence goes (the reason many probably watched this anime), it\u2019s not really too bad until the Shion arc. There are some pretty brutal moments sprinkled throughout, but the Shion arc is the darkest of all of them and is sometimes downright disturbing in the gore department. That said, the beginning of the anime is not as disturbing for its\u2019 gore and violence as the creepy way that the girls act. When shit\u2019s about to go down, their eyes turn cat-like, and this small change in the eyes is just creepy enough to make you feel uncomfortable. It\u2019s like the red eyes in Shiki, just a small little thing but very effective as far as making the person watching feel a little disturbed.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a lot of disturbing content. Even by my standards (and trust me, it\u2019s pretty hard to make me cringe at gore and violence). There was one scene concerning a knife and a neck in particular that was pretty damn gross. And the part where one of the characters has to have her fingernails torn out. That was pretty gross too.\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi\u2019s characters don\u2019t follow any conventions really, they are all disturbing in their own ways and negate any genericism through their insanity. As I said before, I wasn\u2019t pulled into Higurashi by the characters as much as the plot. Maebara Keiichi is a decent protagonist, though I never grew to like him. The same can be said of Rena; while she has a lot of back story and is a very good character as far as story is concerned, she\u2019s meek but for those violent mood swings. The same can basically be said for all the girls. They aren\u2019t really entertaining unless they are ready to murder someone.\\n\\n\r\nThe exception: Shion. Shion is an interesting specimen in that you really get to see her develop into her craziness and you can understand completely where she\u2019s coming from. Shion\u2019s the only character who you get to see one hundred percent of the bad things that have happened to her and get to follow her fall. While Higurashi focuses continually on the latest Watanagashi festival; with the Shion arc it focuses on more than a year worth of plot and her character really shines due to all that attention. She\u2019s quite possibly the greatest insane character I\u2019ve ever seen in an anime, whose passion for a man leads her to kill and torture so many in such brutal ways.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best parts of the anime is the theme song, which is fantastic. It\u2019s eerie and haunting. It has great vocals and is a delight to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the bad parts of the anime is the animation. Sadly, characters can look really weird, especially during faster action sequences where they become blurry Picasso\u2019s rather than people. Even up close the girls always seem to look emaciated.\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi is a fun anime that takes a while to get into. Some of the more slice-of-life moments are unnecessary and boring, but if you can get through those you are rewarded with a pretty deep plot with a lot of disturbing and dramatic moments. It\u2019s not a masterpiece by any regard and some moments can be painful to watch (\u201cThankfully nobody notices I\u2019m wearing an earpiece and talking to myself!\u201d) but it\u2019s overall worth your time and really enjoyable.",

            "content": "(Editor\u2019s note: This will primarily be a review of both seasons, however, I will refrain from going into too much depth about the second season.) \r\n Originality: Let\u2019s face it, we don\u2019t see that too often in the media nowadays. While there\u2019s nothing wrong with something that\u2019s unoriginal inherently, just as long as it\u2019s done in interesting ways, it\u2019s always a breath of fresh air when we see something beyond the norm. What do you get when you combine both mystery and horror into one?\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro ni.\r\n-Story & Characters-\r\nThe story of Higurashi takes place in a small village in the middle of nowhere,called Hinamizawa. Everything seems peaceful, but as the story continues, more and more sinister secrets about Hinamizawa reveal themselves, and this tiny little village is not at all what it seems. Every year, there is a special event called the Cotton Drifting Festival. There are games and food stands, and the local priests perform a ritual in honor of a god named Oyashiro. But things are never that simple: After the Cotton Drifting Festival, one person is murdered, and another person vanishes into thin air (Spirited away). \\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s unique about the story of Higurashi is that it\u2019s actually set in a time loop. After a handful of episodes, time resets, and the story plays out again in a different way (Also known as \u201carcs\u201d). Each arc features the same core concepts and are all connected in certain ways, but we learn new information in each arc, giving you the pieces of the puzzle to solve this mystery once and for all. The arcs primarily focus on different characters, and we learn things about the characters that we didn\u2019t know before, and our views about the characters change, and not every character are how they seem on the surface. The arcs also even sometimes change the personalities of the characters. Why were two of the characters trying to kill the main character during the first arc of the show? How come one of those two characters is cute and bubbly in the next arc? Who is the one that is murdering and \u201cspiriting away\u201d these people after the Cotton Drifting Festival? These are just a few of the shocking reveals that occur in Higurashi. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the questions that are left unanswered in the first season are explained in the second season (Known as \u201cKai\u201d), however, I did say \u201cmost.\u201d There are a few key plot points that are just left up in the air without proper explanations, and while I cannot say what these are due to spoilers, they are unfortunately very large plot holes that simply cannot be ignored. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the second season, I have to admit that it\u2019s not as good as the first season. The atmosphere just isn\u2019t there anymore, and there are parts of it that feel convoluted. However, do not misunderstand me: Kai is VERY good, and it\u2019s necessary to watch it if you want the full story. It was highly enjoyable, even though it was a notch or two below the first season. \\n\\n\r\nBut what\u2019s a great story without characters? The characters are some of the deepest characters that I have seen in a long time. Every character has a story to tell, and not everyone is how they seem. The main character of the first season, Keiichi Maebara, seems like your typical bland teenager, but has a very twisted past, Rena Ryuuguu seems like your typical moe girl, but she has a more sinister side to her, Rika Furude is not your average little girl and is probably the saddest of them all, and I could go on about how three dimensional these characters are. Each of them have some sort of struggle or obstacle to overcome, and watching them develop is very satisfying, and the cast as a whole is very relatable. \\n\\n\r\nMystery, horror, plot twists, deep characters, is there really any reason not to love this story?\\n\\n\r\n-Visuals & Sound-\\n\r\nHigurashi\u2019s visuals are, unfortunately, its weakest suit. Even for the time that it came out (2006), it doesn\u2019t look good. The visuals are below average at best, and nauseating at worst. There are a few scenes in particular where the visuals take a serious nosedive. Sorry, Studio Deen, you horribly failed here. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style, though, mostly makes up for this. The first season is very eerie and creepy, and the atmosphere is just amazing. What\u2019s interesting is that the show uses two different visual styles: One for the comedic, lighthearted scenes, and one for the creepy, scary scenes, and there was a very nice contrast between the two. Something thing that added to the horror aspect of it all were the exaggerated facial and eye expressions, when a character is laughing maniacally, and their pupils shrink. The show is also not for the squeamish, as it hosts a good amount of violence, blood, and gore. \\n\\n\r\nThe dub is an aspect of Higurashi that seems to garner the most criticism, and, to be perfectly honest, I don\u2019t see it. The dub for this anime was very solid. While there were some less-than-stellar performances, the lines for the characters were delivered very well and the voices themselves perfectly matched the characters\u2019 personalities. In fact, there were actually a handful of characters that I preferred in English, particularly that of Keiichi, who I thought was very poorly voiced in Japanese. It\u2019s unfortunate that the second season is not dubbed, and since I am the type of person that prefers to watch anime dubbed, this was disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also solid. What I particularly enjoyed about the soundtrack is just how fitting every song is within the context of every scenario. Watching a funny scene? You\u2019ll hear a quirky song. Watching a terrifying scene? You\u2019ll hear eerie noises, beats, and moans. The best part about the soundtrack, however, the first opening, as it is one of my personal favorite openings of all time, featuring a quiet, creepy, somber song accompanied by disturbing animations and scenery, but I was saddened when they changed it in Kai.\\n\\n\r\n-Conclusion-\\n\r\nOverall, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni (Kai) is a phenomenal anime that masterfully blends together mystery and horror. With a mature and intricate plot, complex characters, and amazing atmosphere, this is one not to be missed by any anime fan. Its flaws are there, and they are noticeable, but these are by no means deal breakers. Higurashi is top tier, and if you\u2019re looking for a great mystery, look no further:\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi has got you covered.\\n\\n\r\n+Intriguing story\\n\r\n+Deep and complex characters\\n\r\n+Eerie atmosphere\\n\r\n+Solid dub\\n\r\n+Nice soundtrack\\n\r\n-Second season, while very good, is not quite as good as the first season\\n\r\n-Second season is not dubbed\\n\r\n-Some things are left unexplained\\n\\n\r\nFinal score:\\n\r\n10/10\\n",

            "content": "Oof. If you're reading this and expecting anything short of a psychological thriller with horror and gore, I suggest you find something else to watch. This is for those not easily rattled and those who can watch rather gruesome... /events/. I recommend not watching this while in the presence of small children, the faint-hearted, in the dark, or while eating. Just a heads up. \r\nNow, that being said, this isn't the mindless gore and violence that one would expect. In fact, it's more of a slow and methodical sort of fear that it induces in you. The storyline (which I will not elaborate upon, becausespoiling something as good as this is definitely a sin) is one big puzzle for the viewer to solve. There are cliffhangers and unexplained ideas simply waiting for you to connect the dots. One of the things I love about this show is that it never spoonfeeds you anything. It simply shows you bits and pieces of a story and leaves it up to you to interpret. All in all, it's a masterpiece in how it's written and told. I suggest binging this in one go if you want to understand it fully. \\n\\n\r\nThe first time I watched this, I nearly stopped because I hated the animation. I have to say that even as I just finished binging it, I've gotten more used to it but a lot of the time I didn't like it. However... when the show delved into more of a sinister feel, I began to appreciate the way the characters were drawn. It gave almost a Madoka Magica sort of feel in the beginning (tho I really despise Madoka Magica) and quickly evolved into darkness. It fools you, and I liked that about it. \\n\\n\r\nOh, the music, where do I begin? The opening was phenomenal. The first time I heard it, shivers just crept down my spine. It's one of the few openings that I listened to all the way through every single episode. On top of that, the opening gives a lot of foreshadowing about the plot itself, but it doesn't make itself apparent other than in hindsight. Watching the opening again after finishing the show was a terrifyingly enlightening experience. The closing was also very soft and soothing, which was a nice way to stop being completely terrified after the actual show ended every episode. That being said, I did rather despise some of the voice actors. Shion's was good, for example, but Rena's and Rika's really pissed me off (Though Rika's VA pulled off a very scary switch to serious later on).\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, I thought that the characters were somewhat cliched and annoying, mostly because it started off as somewhat of a harem school anime. However, as time went on, every single character was developed into a complete, round character. It was astounding, watching it as it happened. Characters that were once just flat tropes became terrifyingly deranged psychopaths, yet it was impossible to hate them at all. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this way too much to be able to express in words. What does that say about my mental state? :D Either way, I've been in somewhat of an anime slump for weeks (and I haven't seen a REAL horror anime in years) but this got me completely back into it. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this if you: liked Another, like psychological horror, like the line between deranged and paranormal, like mysteries, like plot twists, enjoy psychotic characters, like the 'cute' trick premise of Madoka Magica, like gore\\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend this if you: are easily scared, don't like horror, don't like psychological thrillers, can't stomach gore, like your characters as a blank slate of good or evil, are expecting a plot to be handed to you, want to sleep at night \\n\\n\r\nHave a great day everyone!",

            "content": "****There might be spoilers****\r\n*This review is only about the first season of Higurashi no naku koro ni*\r\nThis, this is definetly my favourite anime when it comes to splatter and psychological anime. \r\nWhat is first being embodied as a cute slice of life kind of anime turns into one of the most gruesome experiences out there. Without doubt, if you like splatter - a lot of blood and innards - while the lovliest characters turn into the biggest psychos, then watch this. Until this day, I haven't found any other anime I love as much as I love this one.\r\nThe best of it all is, thatthis anime isn't jsut one single story. It's made with muliple 'arcs' which was kind of hard for me to understand at first, but, I really quickly started to love it as there's even more of all the horror stuff like that. And so, each arc contains one little story, which, in my opinion, improves through the anime. The scenario always turns from bright and cheerful to blood red and brutal.\\n\\n\r\nAs this anime is pretty old by now, so is the animation. But still, I find that Studio Deen did a great work on the crazy faces of the characters e.g. Renas eyes in the first arc. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the best things in this one is the music. There's NO other intro music that gets stuck in your head as the first opening of the Higurashi series. Eiko Shimamiya did a really good job there and I just can't stop listening to it. It is never getting boring for me and I always find something in there, that feels new to me.\\n\\n\r\nI already said that the characters are all truly adorable and - when it comes to it - scary as hell. Each character comes with his or her own personalities and  is letting them shine through that.\\n\\n\r\nKeiichi, who just moved in the town, already found friends, as they are in a small class because the town is so small.\\n\\n\r\nRena, a quite shy and nice girl, who's in love with adorable things has a dark backstory.\\n\\n\r\nMion, a girl which acts kind of like a boy, a member of one of the three leading families in Hinamizawa, which apparently have their hands in a lot of  dirty buisness  \\n\\n\r\nand\\n\\n\r\nSatoko and Rika, who both suffered the same - the death of their parents through a unknown reason.\\n\\n\r\nAll the stories of every single character makes each very interesting to me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd all of that leads to my rating of this anime - a 10/10.",

            "content": "Honestly this anime is one of the best in my opinion but there is alot of comments saying to slow or just the same thing over and over again but i tell you that is not the case the first couple of episodes sets the stage for many different types of stories every arc is different in alot of ways (the 1st episode i always introductions of each arc) like how in one of the arcs were more focusing on one character from another.\r\nHorror- Well to be honest if you want to see some blood and some gruesome killings than yes this has it butthis anime is more for psychological. The show doesent really build off shock factor once you actually get into the show. When i was watching this it always made me think what i would do in that situation and you could pass it by saying something funny or whatever but when you really dive deep into your mind to figure out what you would actually do in that exact situation. Its almost frightening to think of that its almost no different than what the characters would or could do. I think thats where the true horror lies although going through the manga and anime at some points i would think differently\\n\\n\r\nStory- So im going to be honest you have to pay attention to the story because sometimes it can get confusing but im not going to lie knowing the full entire story i believe that it has one of the best story lines known to date.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/artwork- So lets keep in mind this artwork is from 2006 and because of that i still believe this artwork has it own style to it although the artwork in the manga is alot better i still think it doesent really need to be called bad\\n\\n\r\nSound- So as the name implies (higurashi means \"evening cicadas\") there is alot of birds and guess what cicadas when listening to this you mosy likely hear some repeats of the cicadas but what anime doesent have that overall i think the sounds do add to the aesthetic at horror moments it almost dead silent with some exceptions of sharp sounds i think overall its pretty good\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- So the characters guess what. have very different personalities ranging to tomboy to shy to just upbeat suspicious i believe that all these personalities display the good and bad of each character and not just sucking off the MC constently so which they rarely really do. When i watch this anime i feel like im really getting characters i can grow fond of.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i think this a masterpiece this anime changed my look on my day to day life so if you have the time i would really recomend to atleast give it a go\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Every anime watcher has their personal favorite, and this is mine. Riding on the back of excellent characterization, a brilliantly gripping narrative, stellar vocal performances, and a beautifully executed atmosphere. \r\nThe element that Higurashi does best happens to also be the single most important element of any story, which is the cast of characters. Starring a cast of six kids, every single one has a distinctive personality, a backstory to reinforce said personality, and a metric ton of chances to showcase their qualities.\r\nThe story is an excellent mix of the mystery and horror genres, but I would argue that Higurashi is ultimately a drama withmystery and horror elements. Halfway through the season, it shifts to explaining more backstory and further emphasizing the personality of the cast, and the mystery/horror begin to fall to the side. However, it's after that point  that the writing really shines. The interactions between the cast are pure gold, and you truly hope for them to succeed in their struggle. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the animation isn't the best (this is a DEEN show after all), I really need to give credit to the excellent death scenes. Higurashi is soaked in enough blood to fill the Atlantic basin, and it appears in some truly well-made scenes of characters being offed. The  animation gets highly fluent, the level of detail is higher than the rest of the show, and the whole thing comes together for truly memorable scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in this show (in the sub, not the dub) is perhaps the best I've ever heard. Every VA performs to the absolute highest standard, and completely sells their capability. My personal favorite performance is Mai Nakahara in the role of Rena, who shifts from quiet to furious in the matter of seconds and manages to nail both attitudes perfectly. Satsuki Yukino delivers a wonderfully unhinged performance in the roles of Mion and Shion, and has perhaps the greatest laugh of anyone I've ever heard. The others are varying levels of good, but nobody's performance is at all bad. the dub is utter garbage, but I'm not factoring that in to my overall opinion on the series. The actual soundtrack is pure gold, with beautiful atmospheric pieces playing at just the right moments. The OP of the show is famous as being one of the best in anime history, with a brilliantly unnerving atmosphere to it that gets the viewer pumped for the upcoming episode. The ED isn't quite as good, but it's still fun to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Higurashi fluently masters all the most important elements: great characters, brilliant story, and wonderful voice acting. While the animation could be slightly better, it's good enough to pass by anyway. Ultimately this series is one that nobody should miss, and it easily earns its place as my favorite anime ever.",

            "content": "Hinamizawa is a village frozen in time, and I\u2019m not just talking about it\u2019s isolationist principals.  It\u2019s the kind of small town where everyone knows everyone, and most family names can be traced back for centuries.  Despite belonging to a family of outsiders, new resident Keiichi Maebara has had no problem fitting in with the community.  In less than a year, he\u2019s already amassed a close circle of friends who are just as snarky, competitive and weird as he is, and his days playing games with them are pure, peaceful bliss...  Right up until a chance encounter with a transient photographerleads him to a glimpse into some of the town\u2019s darker, more disturbing secrets.  As it turns out, Hinamizawa was almost destroyed to make way for a dam a few years ago, and the conflict eventually resulted in a gruesome murder...  And to make matters worse, mysterious deaths and disappearances have literally become a yearly thing in this quiet village, and the deeper he digs, the closer it takes him to the very people he\u2019s becomes close to.  With every new discovery leading to more questions, will Keiichi even survive long enough to untangle this vast, intertwining spiderweb of a mystery?\\n\\n\r\nStudio Deen has a pretty dodgy reputation, but they\u2019ve been getting better in recent years.  Obviously, 2006 is not a recent year.  Well, maybe that\u2019s not entirely fair, because they did release titles that were okay looking, and that\u2019s pretty much the camp that Higurashi no Naku Koroni, also known as simply When They Cry, belongs to.  It\u2019s not too bad looking over-all, nor is it the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen from it\u2019s studio, but it has a hard time not tipping it\u2019s hand as to the fact that they didn\u2019t have a great budget to work with when they were animating it.  It checks off most of the boxes for responsibly managing this issue, though...  There are a lot of static images and key frames, but the backgrounds are well drawn and highly detailed, and they\u2019re edited in such a way that they never get boring, what with sharp cuts, dramatic panning in all the right places, intense close-ups, and heavy support from the soundtrack and dialogue to keep you on the edge of your seat while it milks the scenery.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t always work, however, and you\u2019ll still get the odd moment when two people are having a conversation while walking, and their pictures are basically just being bounced up and down in time with each other while their lips move, which is kind of an ugly exception to make, considering all the other areas where the visuals were able to successfully compensate for their shortcomings.  I\u2019m also willing to bet, although I haven\u2019t really looked into this, that having the series largely take place in the same village means a lot of the backgrounds and scenery get reused, which might be why they were able to splurge so hard on background art.  I know that at the very least, the repetitive nature of some stories has allowed animation to be reused, although I can\u2019t say for sure whether or not it happened in more than one obvious instance.  I will say that for a village we never leave, the range of settings that it lends itself to is surprisingly diverse, even if most areas get revisited a ton of times.\\n\\n\r\nOne area where it does come up short a lot of the time is with character animation.  Now, in regard to the character design, as cartoony and over-designed as the characters may look, it turns out that they\u2019re just as malleable as the setting, with each one of them having quite a few more outfits than their basic, everyday anime attire.  Yes, I say everyday meaning that the characters do generally wear the same clothes everyday, but they have other outfits too, and the switch between them does feel natural with the way it\u2019s all used throughout the story.  The repetitive outfits do help in some cases, like in one story arc where outfits being exchanged between two characters is very important to the plot.  The area where the animation falls short is in some instances where we get the aforementioned dramatic close-ups, and the artwork gets so distorted that even if it works in the moment, they look really weird when paused.  The characters also unfortunately stray off-model more than once, with some shots showing their legs looking about an inch thick, and some truly derpy expressions for anyone willing to search for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs do manage to shine where it counts, though.  This is meant to be a horror title after all, and while their outfits and hair colors may be a bit on the goofy side, they\u2019re still designed to be extremely expressive, and instead of the sweet doe eyed smiles and waterfalls of tears that you may expect from similar moe-inspired characters, their faces can contort in very frightening ways, showing off a range of emotion that can convey paranoia, fear, exhaustion, full-on batshit insanity, and in some cases, the cold dead eyes of hopelessness and resignation.  Keep in mind, some of these characters are still little, like, literally little.  A couple of the female characters have very generously endowed figures, which you\u2019re probably no stranger to if you\u2019re into anime, but even when they are showing cleavage or baring skin, they\u2019re never sexualized, either by the story or the camera.  If anything, some of their most revealing moments take place in scenes where you\u2019re meant to be more worried than titillated, with their exposure linked more strongly to their fear and vulnerability than to your pleasure.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this series, for the most part, is very subtle, and used almost exclusively as support for the story.  Aside from the obligatory fun with friends music, of which there are a few generic sounding tracks, the composers knew exactly what they were doing whenever it came time to accentuate the tension of a scene, which they can do with nothing more than a few well-picked notes to drone on while these pivotal scenes build up to their inevitable conclusions.  One of my favorite tracks is Michishirube, which they play during a lot of the more sad or depressing moments, making it instantly recognizable not just for the feelings it evokes, but for it\u2019s attachment to some genuinely heart-wrenching moments.  There\u2019s also a lot to be said for the sound design, which takes the place of the music in a lot of instances, with such effects as concurrent thuds and especially with the shrill cry of cicadas, or Higurashi in Japanese,which the series was of course named after.  Sounds like these are way more memorable than the music, which feels like it was kind of the point.\\n\\n\r\nAs subtle and forgettable as the music may be...  And I have spoken to some people who didn\u2019t realize the series had music at all, which speaks to how good a job the legendary Kenji Kawai did...  The opening to this portion of the series is my favorite of all time, and no, that\u2019s not me using hyperbole.  The song captures all of the tension and drama of the series, with almost all of the more chilling sound choices taking place in-between the actual verses, and it\u2019s easily one of the only anime songs that I feel gets better when you listen to the original, uncut version, which opens on a more creepy, demonic sounding gasp of a note that wouldn\u2019t feel out of place in a Fatal Frame game.  The actual video is filled with imagery that carries the themes of the series as well as clever foreshadowing as to the fates and pasts of the characters.  It\u2019s hard to decipher what they all mean without seeing the entire series, so you can\u2019t really appreciate how brilliant the image of Rika taking off a mask really is until later on.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, I think most audiences will be able to grasp the significance of all the flowers and kaleidoscope imagery, at least as far as it\u2019s representation of twisted, distorted innocence,  and while that\u2019s not the central theme of the story, it does support it\u2019s more important themes quite nicely.  The singer is a woman named Eiko Shimanaya, a Japanese singer who\u2019s best known for her work on this series, because she sings the opening and closing song for both seasons...  And yes, this means she also sings the English language closing song, Why or Why Not, which is sung from the character Rena\u2019s point of view as blood flows over a black background.  This, as well, is really awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe English dub, like the animation, is okay.  It start s out on a really weird note, with the actors using voices that were obviously directed with the intention of matching their Japanese counterparts, but this is usually a really bad idea.  Considering this was a Geneon effort, it\u2019s also not a surprising choice, as a lot of their dubs towards the end of their existence were plagued by screechy, unnatural sounding performances of women trying their best to sound like moe characters, which there really isn\u2019t any English language equivalent to.  The problem is just as bad here, but the actors did the best they could with it, and it does get mostly better over time.  The voices almost all sound unnatural and awkward, but the actors do settle into their roles fairly quickly, if you manage to stick around long enough for them to do so.  The acting, in spite of this unnatural quality, is largely competent, but the performances are just about as inconsistent as the moods swings of the cast.  \\n\\n\r\nGrant George, who has a very long resume in both Japanese and American productions, does an admirable job as the lead role Keiichi, even if the voice he has to use sounds like somebody doing a really bad impression of Bob Dylan.  He shares a similar quality to most of the rest of the main cast...  He sounds weird and awkward during his down-time, but shines really effectively when he has to push the character to more intense material.  The same thing goes for Rebecca Fortstadt as Rika, Jennie Kwan as Satoko, and Mela Lee as Rena...  They sound almost unbearable most of the time, and rarely ever sound like actual people, but when they have to freak out, scream, or, you know, act at all, you\u2019d practically forget any complaints you may have had about them before.  There are two exceptions to this,. and the more bizarre one is Megan Hollingshead, who you may know as both Officer Jenny and Nurse Joy in the earlier seasons of Pokemon, who plays Mion Sonozaki, among others.  \\n\\n\r\nWith her, it\u2019s the opposite situation.  She sounds great normally, matching her Japanese counterpart beat-for-beat, even improving faster than her peers after the awkward beginning, but it\u2019s during the more intense scenes where she has more trouble, sounding over the top and hammy instead of genuinely insane.  The other exception is with the supporting cast, most of whom actually used their real names in the credits(the only main actor to do this was Grant George), and while Kyle Hebert and Karen Strassmen do some pretty solid jobs as the ill-fated Jirou Tomitake and Mio Takano, the actor who most impressed me was John Snyder in the role of Detective Oichi, a character who\u2019s personality seemed to change depending on each story arc.  Aside from these names, The English dub may be serviceable enough for hardcore dub fans, but it doesn\u2019t hold a candle to the original Japanese.  Back when this series was still new, the terrifying performances of the female seiyuu were legendary, and kind of turned the series into a viral hit.  The sub is highly recommended in this case.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of those performances, Higurashi\u2019s popularity in the states is very similar to another title that came out around the same time, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya(It\u2019s eerie how many discussions lead to her, isn\u2019t it?).  Both shows slowly gained an audience through viral exposure...  Replace the Hare Hare Yukai with videos of over the top death scenes and scary Japanese laughter...  And soon took the nation by storm, becoming one of the most popular and well known titles, before the diminishing returns of it\u2019s franchise caught up with it and it faded back into obscurity.  These days, it\u2019s easy to find people who\u2019ve never seen either title, which used to not be the case.  The difference is that unlike that famous moe nerd comedy, the original Higurashi series has aged really well, at least in terms of story and content.  However, since it\u2019s been largely forgotten, I can\u2019t stress enough that this is a show you really need to go into blindly, so before I go any further, I have to ask that you at least watch up to episode 5.\\n\\n\r\nDid you do it?  You promise?  Good.  Rena hates liars.\\n\\n\r\nNo, if you\u2019ve gotten that far into the series, you\u2019ve probably noticed a few peculiar details, some of which you may have questions about.  Yes, the story escalates very quickly, but more importantly, if you\u2019re like me on my first viewing, you might be confused as to why and how the series reset itself.  That\u2019s something you\u2019re going to have to get used to with Higurashi...  Rather than one long continuous story, it\u2019s made up of several smaller arcs, which occupy completely different timelines that focus on their own unique situations and perspectives.  Setting aside the how, as I promise there is an in-universe explanation for it, the reason why is because this anime is based on a series of visual novels, and if you know anything about those, you\u2019ll know that VN\u2019s and dating games present a tricky challenge to anyone who wants to adapt them...  How do you make a coherent series out of a story that has so many branching and unique paths to explore?  There are many answers to this dilemma, most of them bad, but Higurashi luckily had the perfect solution ready and waiting in the source material.\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t spoil what the secret behind it is, especially because you won\u2019t officially learn it until the second season, but there is a reason that time is always rewound after a huge disaster, and it has several effects on the story, both positive and negative.  On the positive side, the pacing is unusually tight, and while the series does have a tendency to goof off in the early stages of most arcs, none of it ever feels like wasted time...  Not even the Time Wasting Arc, which, yes, is a thing.  Another benefit is the lack of plot armor, as any character can die at any time during a story, and they\u2019ll be there again in the next arc.  You would think this would take away the tension and stakes of any given scenario, but you\u2019re wrong, because some seriously strong writing gives each arc a healthy dose of gravity and stakes, which they go out of their way to make you care about, resurrection be damned.  Of course, then you have one of the biggest drawbacks of the series, which is the heavy amount of inconsistency between each arc.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, while we\u2019re supposed to believe this is just the same period of time repeating itself, there really isn\u2019t any clear divergence point.  Rather, most stories, save for two that work as mirrors of each other from different perspectives, follows a totally different series of events, which feels less like a proper Butterfly Effect story and more like the writers just doing whatever the hell they want.  There are some details that never change, such as Hinamizawa\u2019s history and certain events taking place at the Cotton Drifting Festival, but aside from that, some of the changes can be baffling at best and stupid at worst.  Like, you\u2019ve seen episode five, right?  Notice how easy Mion gave up the fact that she had a twin sister?  In the first story arc, she was tight lipped about a lot of her personal details, but she doesn\u2019t even question how Keiichi met her sister, or what he thought of her.  I can only assume this was done to service the reveal at the end of the episode, but it feels like a full-on betrayal of her character.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of inconsistencies like that, and while I\u2019m glad that certain details that were meant to be reveals and mysteries in previous arcs become common knowledge in future arcs...  It does, at least, keep the story from becoming repetitive...  It has another element working in it\u2019s favor.  Higurashi likes to play around with the concept of an Unreliable Narrator...  You know, that literary trope where you don\u2019t know the truth of a story, because it\u2019s being told from the perspective of someone who\u2019s too biased or unstable to give you an accurate recounting of events?  There\u2019s more than enough evidence in this story to suggest that it\u2019s narrators don\u2019t always see things as they are, and there are times when you can\u2019t really guarantee if entire events are really going down as you\u2019re seeing them.  you can\u2019t trust what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not, which works as an excuse for Higurashi to do plenty of things that I\u2019d call shenanigans on with any other anime.  You don\u2019t know whether characters are really living, dying, or even present when you\u2019re told they are, so of course some personality based inconsistencies are going to happen.\\n\\n\r\nBesides, even with those inconsistencies occasionally working against them, the cast of characters in this series is still absurdly strong.  They\u2019re all complex and layered, with their own unique flaws and motivations, and these play very well into their own individual stories.  To be fair, they don\u2019t all get their own perspective stories, at least not in this season, but they\u2019re still at least explored thoroughly in other character\u2019s stories, either as antagonists or in supporting roles.  The issues these characters go through are unbelievably relatable, as well.  Even though most of us have never had first hand experience with the more horrifying elements of the stories...  Let\u2019s face it, most people don\u2019t wind up involved in the middle of conspiracies or murder cases...  They do have to deal with real world issues, like divorce, child abuse, watching loved ones suffer and get taken advantage of, family drama and forbidden love, and while the way they approach and resolve their issues may be extreme, it never feels melodramatic or cheap, because of how well we know and care about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to group all of these situations into one theme, which would admittedly be a huge stretch, I\u2019d have to see that this is mostly a show about secrets.  It\u2019s about the dark secrets you keep from others, secrets you know are being kept from you, what you should and shouldn\u2019t tell your friends and the possible consequences of digging too deeply into someone else\u2019s affairs.  This theme is explored thoughtfully, and from many angles, and to be honest, I can personally relate to it, because I\u2019ve been on some very distinct sides of it.  I\u2019ve been left in the dark plenty of times in regard to issues directly effecting me.  My whole family keeps secrets from me and other people just for the sake of convenience, using obvious strategic lies that I felt alienated by.  I used to have friends who I thought I could trust, but who dug up dirt on me behind my back and spread it all to pretty much my entire workplace.  I don\u2019t know if you can find all this relatable, but for me, it hits really close to home.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, there are some problematic elements.  On top of other issues, there\u2019s some really outdated gender politics on display, with more than one instance of female characters basically being told to smile more, and there\u2019s one really awkward moment where a grown man expresses a genuine interest in romantically pursuing and eventually marrying a preteen, but considering the fact that this is supposed to be 1980\u2019s Japan, we should probably just be grateful that it isn\u2019t worse.  Also, while I\u2019m glad there isn\u2019t any obvious romantic sub-plot among the main cast(aside from some flirtatious banter and a couple of hinted or confirmed crushes), which I understand is accurate to the non-H VN, but there is one story arc that could be described as a yandere-type situation, with a character\u2019s psychotic behavior tied directly to her unrequited love for another character, but I\u2019d also argue that her circumstances are much more forgivable than they would be in most similar titles.  \\n\\n\r\nHigurashi , or When They Cry, is available from Sentai Filmworks.  The original Geneon DVDs are out of print, but the new format is way superior, because there\u2019s a Bluray option, and the disks are divided so that each one carries a different arc, so it\u2019s easier to watch whatever individual story that you want without having to change disks.  Sentai also released the sequel, Higurashi Kai, and one of the OVAs, Higurashi Rei, in the same format.  Three other OVAs have not been released stateside(but you should totally check out Outbreak), neither have the awful live action movies.  The light novels and a live action TV show haven\u2019t been released either, but the manga has been released stateside by Yen Press, and it contains some crazy details from the games that the anime omitted.  I don\u2019t know any specifics about the games, but I\u2019ve heard some of them are available online.  There\u2019s also a spiritual successor called Umineko, which I\u2019ve seen, and it\u2019s honestly pretty awful, but it\u2019s still kind of interesting with some of it\u2019s choices, so give it a watch.\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi might just be one of the most effective horror titles in anime history.  It\u2019s MO is to keep it\u2019s focus on suspense, building up scenes of simple conversations and interactions with tense music and creepy, unsettling direction, leading to pay-offs so abrupt and shocking that most of them have become memes or AMV Hell jokes in the years since.  It avoids using jump scares like the plague, and keeps it\u2019s horror elements centered firmly on the story and plot, and while it doesn\u2019t go out of it\u2019s way to be edgy or disturbing, it still never shies away from showing the gory details of any given scenario when the time is right.  The mystery is tightly woven and full of red herrings and unanswered questions, and while it lays out several details at a decent pace, it still leaves enough loose threads to leave you wanting more, even if the second season winds up being a bit of a disappointment.  It\u2019s not perfect, though, and even if you were to excuse the lackluster  visuals and spotty dub, the writing itself still leaves enough holes to tarnish what could have been considered a masterpiece.  I give Higurashi: When They Cry an 8/10.",

            "content": "Higurashi no naku koro ni (When they cry) is one of the few actually good horror anime out there. But even though it's horror, it also tells a beautiful tale about friendship and changing your fate. So, even if you aren't a fan of horror, I would still recommend you to watch this anime because of how beautiful and sad it is.\r\nThis review may contain some minor spoilers.\r\nStory 10/10\r\nHigurashi tells a story about Keiichi Maebara and his group of friends who live normal lives in a village called Hinamizawa, until Keeichi hears about the terrible past of their village. Every year one person dies andone disappears. After this his friends start acting weird and suspicious around him.\\n\\n\r\nBest part about Higurashi is definitely the story. There are 6 story arcs in the first season of Higurashi and 3 in the second season. The first arc begins with Keeichi living normal life with his friends until someone goes crazy and people start dying, but in the second arc, it's like nothing had ever happened and the people who died are suddenly alive again. This happens with all arcs, and the reason for this is explained in the second season, like most of the things that happen in this series. I highly recommend you to watch the second season of this anime right after you have finished the first season, because watching only the first season is like dropping this show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are the second best part of this show. They are likeable and it's interesting to see them go crazy.\\n\r\nKeiichi Maebara is your typical boring harem/shounen protagonist, but what makes him interesting is seeing him gradually lose his mind or reacting to his friends going crazy though that applies to all of the main characters.\\n\r\nRena Ryuugu is waifu material.\\n\r\nRika Furude is my favourite character but I can't tell you because of spoilers.\\n\r\nSatoko Houjou is sometimes kind of a brat and that's why not many like her but I like her. She blames herself for the disappearance of his brother. She tries to act very independent because she believes that her brother ran away because she was too dependant on him and I find that pretty interesting.\\n\r\nMion Sonozaki is okay character.\\n\r\nShion Sonozaki's love for Satoko's brother, Satoshi in the fifth arc is also very interesting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic is very subjective so I know that not everyone is going to agree with me, but this anime has one of the best OSTs. I often listen to these OSTs on my free time and they fit the series very well. The OPs and EDs are also very  good. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is very average. It isn't good but it isn't bad either, though the crazy faces that the characters make are pretty good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI love a good psychological horror and I love a good emotional story. Higurashi has both of them so of course I am going to love this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nGo watch this anime",

            "content": "Yes, I did say I was doing Kanon next, but I found out Kanon wasn't really my cup of tea, then I came across it's mentally unstable half brother. The rest is history. \r\nSTORY: 10\r\nThe story keeps you on your toes practically the whole time, even the slice-of-life portions at the beginning of each 4-6 episode arc fit right in and do little to disrupt the near perfect pacing this series has. Even after just watching the first season, most of the questions one might have after one arc is resolved in a later arc. I found myself hooked every night watching entire arcs. Eventhough this is not quite the end of the series, the ending is perfect and if there wasn't a season two, it still would be one of my favorite anime endings of all time, which it happens to still be.\\n\\n\r\nPRESENTATION: 4\\n\r\nYeah, let's just say you shouldn't expect high quality from a late 00's Studio Deen Production. Even in climactic action scenes, the detail in the animations is extremely choppy (geddit) and the character designs, while not  THAT bad. Compared to S2's (as I have seen as of now), it looks very undetailed. While the minimalist approach can be admirable, it can often look very derpy. Though that's not to bring down the over-the-top faces characters make that are so crazy that they actually work.The visuals help compliment the series' atmosphere, but overall, the presentation is bleh.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10\\n\r\nHigurashi's excellent use of sound more than makes up for the bang-up job they did animating the thing. The series' use of ambient noise, such as cicadas chirping (complimenting its title, When the Cicadas Cry) and that little fountain that you can hear flowing in the Sonozaki house help establish a calm, yet foreboding atmosphere, like a fistful of murder is about to strike. The sounds used for noises like slashing, footsteps, etc. help bring this anime to life. The soundtrack is fantastic as well, with several motifs used to great effect at key moments, and interestingly sparingly used, as many moments, especially during the more foreboding moments don't have music at all, letting the ambient sound do the work. Good Job.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9\\n\r\nWe have a solid set of mains, all with some sort of mental problems, such as family issues, a past of violence, and being a general creep. The side characters are a bit of a mess. You don't really get to know much about the side characters since they tend to, you know, die soon after they are introduced. But the mains are very well constructed and you end up falling in love with them even though all of them murder each other at some point. While Keiichi is technically the main character, the role is not really set in stone, as many characters share the spotlight, with some even stealing it, like in Shion's arc. Overall, the characters help make this a good watch, pulling your heartstrings while they brutally murder each other. It's hard to find another anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nRECOMMENDATION: VERY HIGH\\n\\n\r\nTry and avoid Hinamizawa this summer, okay?\\n\\n\\n",

This is one of the few things from the horror genre I was able to watch all the way through. Don't get me wrong, this scared the shit out of me when I watched it, so much that for a long time I was afraid to leave my house at night andI still can't sleep with my closet open (pro tip: don't watch scary stuff right before you go to bed and after you eat that one food that always gives you weird dreams). What kept me was how interesting the stories were and how you never really guessed what would happen next. But the huge thing for me was the characters. There wasn't a character that I didn't fear at one point and I didn't love at one point. They were all so interesting and kept me sucked into the show.\\n\r\nI would absolutely recommend this anime to anyone who loves horror and gore, and to anyone who thinks they can handle it. Just don't watch it before bed.",

            "content": "You know what? I honestly have to thank this show. It has taught me a valuable life lesson that I will cherish forever: It\u2019s that I should never EVER live in really-small-town, Japan. So thanks, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni (When They Cry), I love you man.\r\nBut no seriously, this anime is a decent horror offering that suffers from a few common flaws inherent to the genre. \r\nThe premise is simple, because of main character\u2019s family, he has to move to really-small-town, Japan. But this innocent-looking village has some dark and terrible secrets (because of course it does), and when the spooky shenanigans start happening,it\u2019s up to Kei-chan and his trusty harem to make things entirely worse for everybody (because, you know, anime plot). \\n\\n\r\nThe atmosphere of this setting, clich\u00e9d as it may be, nails that \u201ceverything just seems slightly off\u201d vibe you would find in traditional horror films, tickling at your morbid curiosity and compelling you to move. There is a legitimate sense of lovecraftian fear felt by both the audience and the cast, as if these people are messing with a power far beyond what they can hope to overcome. It permeates into every action and thought, and you can feel the sense of the hopelessness about their situation. Friends and family turn against each other. Delusions and paranoia feed increasingly disturbed mental states. And the entire cast is forced to live a gruesome and deadly cycle of death and despair. There are times when you just simply don\u2019t know what to believe anymore. Are the ones that went crazy, really crazy? Are they legitimately onto something, or are they just plain bonkers? Who is really the bad guy here? Are there even any good guys? And what is even driving everybody to deception and murder?\\n\\n\r\nI also have to compliment how the dark, morbid parts of every arc are mixed in between more light-hearted, comical, slice-of-life moments. This part of the show has the dual effect of easing the tension and lulling you into a false sense of security that everything is A-OK up until when the human defecation hits the fan.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is presented in a format similar to what can be found to shows like Yojouhan Shinwa Taikei (The Tatami Galaxy). The entire show is divided up into partially self-contained arcs. Each arc contains a different flavor of spooky shenanigan that plays out over the course of 2-6 episodes. At the conclusion of every arc, the show is \u201creset\u201d back to a beginning point so that a new arc can play out.\\n\\n\r\nWhat this format has in redundancy (reintroducing almost everything at the beginning of each arc), it makes up for in its ability for clever storytelling. With each new arc, the story is told from a different characters. The change in viewpoints, and the subsequent change in what parts of the story are told this time around, slowly reveals more plot points by which the audience can use to piece together a larger narrative. This slow process of revelation, especially in a horror, effectively establishes an atmosphere of tension and over the course of the whole series. It compels you to keep watching for the sake of learning something new concerning the mystery and seeing the scary stuff happen in a different way.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some concerns I have with the show though. For one, the uniquely presented story isn\u2019t airtight. There are some plot points that were never really resolved, and there were few inconsistences between the arcs that shared a connection. The occasionally some of the characters suffer from the classic \u201coh life-threatening scary movie situation? Something seriously aloof? Time to go full retard!\u201d affliction affecting most horror show casts. I want to cut them some slack, but I was hoping that the writing was better than that.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary:\\n\r\n+ atmosphere and setting that provoked tension and suspense\\n\r\n+ cool presentation of story\\n\r\n- some plot holes\\n\\n\r\nGood show overall with some flaws.\\n",

            "content": "Have you ever bothered by the slice of life genre? I don't mean in just anime, but in other television programmes like soap operas or a romantic comedy film. Personally I find a great deal of it mundane and just plain dull to watch. Let's use K-ON as an example. Now I really like this anime. The music is good and there\u2019s plenty of good light-hearted comedy. But the one area I find it the most weak in is its take on the slice of life. It\u2019s just very standard, nothing special, something that anyone could whip up. I can understand that mostly life islike that, but I just don\u2019t think it can be very good entertainment This is not the case with Higurashi. In fact the end result is quite the opposite.\\n\\n\r\nWhat this anime has done is taken one of the most common elements of anime we have seen throughout its history: the loli character. The cute young girl stereotype, the one individual who from the audience point of view would never harm a fly. That stereotype has been ripped to shreds by this anime. And does it so brilliantly.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is told through a series of arcs, following the encounters of a close group of friends, the majority of which could be filed under loli or at least something close to it. But as time goes by, each are reveals that each one of them has skeletons in the closet which, when discovered drastically change the dynamic of their relationships, whether it be friendship, family or love. Everyone has their lives derailed in an insane manner.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the way that this is one is just fantastic for the slice of life genre. To begin with anyone could be fooled into believing its simple school/slice of life anime, the kind of one that can be found almost anyway these days. Then BAM! This illusion is shattered, whether it is what a person suddenly says or a certain event. The atmosphere changes form pleasant everyday scenario to having you on the edge of your seat. And from that point you are left like that. Higurashi has become a ticking time bomb with the viewer completely aware of it, yet at the same time wondering could possibly change these almost princess peach style characters, to psychotic murderers who would stab Bowser in the face if he so much as coughed within a few metres. It's intriguing to watch but also scary: the first anime to actually do so which is impressive in itself for me.\\n\\n\r\nBut the good stuff doesn\u2019t stop there. There's this real feeling of mystery about the whole series, about why the girls have all turned psycho, and the background events that occur. And as the series progresses, pieces of the puzzle slip into place, something will happen that will destroy all your detective work and cause to revaluate it again and again. I really liked this, because if it were easily solved, I feel that some of that atmosphere, that tension would have been lost. The series just feels like pure chaos at the end with no obvious solution to some of the biggest questions. And in this lies the fear of something unknown. In fact, the only thing I know for certain is that I'm never gonna be able to look at the loli stereotype in the same way again. \\n\\n\r\nWell, I hope you enjoyed this review and please give me any feedback on it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I guess the best place to start with a review for this anime would be it's main unique selling point, the story it tells. I will try to refrain from giving away any spoilers as one of this anime's best points is the suspense it creates.\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro ni, often shortened to just Higurashi, has a story that branches over 26 episodes, however these episodes do not always fit together. Without spoiling too much the episodes will string together for about 3 in a row, then in the next it will be as though those episodes never happened. This happens several times within the26 episodes. Although this keeps the anime interesting it can also make it a little hard to follow at times. It is an example of an anime that needs your full attention when watching or you'll be in the dark by the end of each episode. That being said it is very good at grabbing you're attention with insane plot twists and each episode being filled with suspense, it's hard to not want to keep watching.  Alongside this there are no episodes that feel like fillers, the pacing was executed perfectly.  Although it is a crime mystery/horror anime, it also has some comedic themes to it. They blend together extremely well and I have not found another anime since watching Higurashi that can compete with this. \\n\r\nThe ending to this anime leaves quite a few plot holes, but these are then filled with the second season, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni kai. It makes you want to watch it as the last episode ends with a cliff hanger.\\n\r\nAnother key point to mention about the storyline is how well the characters help to move it all along. There is not a single character who doesn't have a key part in the storyline. And each character had different qualities that bounce of each other perfectly. \\n\r\nOne of the only things that lets down the anime is the art style. It is very unrealistic apart from in the more gory scenes. Consisting of bright colours and fun designs it takes away some of the atmosphere within the anime which is the main thing it needs to tell the story. The change from the vivid colours to the more realistic violent scenes felt to broken and there was no in-between blend to help it flow. However all of the characters were very different and individually designed making it easy to remember names and tell them apart. The names themselves are very fitting for the characters, however the only part I didn't agree with was that there was a set of twins called Mion and Shion. I felt their names were too similar showing a lack of originality, although the names themselves fit the two characters exceedingly well.\\n\r\nThe characters voices were extremely fitting of each character in the English dub and original Japanese voice acting. However I felt that the Japanese voice acting was far more dramatic in the horror situations and was far better at creating the right atmosphere and at certain points scaring the viewer and making them feel uneasy. The English dub just didn't quite fit the characters as well and did not flow as well. I would highly recommend watching it in the English sub/ original Japanese voice acting. The music to me was one of the best points of the anime, each song fit the atmosphere at the point, and the more relaxed songs were overall beautiful to listen to, while the more up tempo horror style music helped create uneasiness.\\n\r\nOverall I think this anime as a whole is a very good watch but only if you are willing to watch the second season, Higarashi no Naku Koro ni, as well as the anime may not make complete sense. As I have watched both of these I can say I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and would highly recommend it to all anime watchers that enjoy suspense filled horror and crime mystery. I have re-watched the anime a few times and I can safely say it doesn't ruin it at all, you just find yourself picking up on new things when you watch it again, this then gives you those moments of 'ohh yeaaah' when you realise something you didn't the first time you watched it. I think this anime is highly memorable and is likely to stick with you whether you love it or hate it.",

            "content": "Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni is an excellent psychological horror/mystery anime. It starts off looking like your typical Harem anime with one male protagonist surrounded by a cast of female characters, but boy does that image change. Your first clue is when you start hearing about the mystery of the Hinamizawa dam project that ended in a violent murder. Keiichi, the male protagonist begins to wonder about this murder, so he attempts to seek information from his friends Rena and Mion. He begins to question the credibility of his friends, because they seem to be hiding the dark truth from him. Eventually, Keiichi comes tothe conclusion that he is going to have to prepare for one hell of a fight against his friends. I will leave it at that, because I don't want to spoil anything. To be honest, you will probably be wondering what the hell just happened after the first four episodes. Well, you might be a little confused throughout the first season, as you will get more and more pieces to the puzzle throughout the series. This season has a total of six chapters or arcs where you will see different versions of a similar story. As each chapter progresses you will obtain more and more clues to the crisis of Hinamizawa. The second season definitely has more of a central story line, and will explain everything that had you wondering in the first season. The problem is that Funimation has not dubbed the second season, and nobody really seems to know if they ever will. I really hope that Funimation will licence and dub the second season of Higurashi because it is a fantastic season that will really clear up any confusion that you might have had about the first season. Overall, I really recommended this series, that is if you can stomach animated blood, gore, torture, and violence.",

It has unique story telling, unique plot and unique character. Watching this series is like playing a game. The series were divided by several arc, each arc start a new stories, but it is related to the previous arc. Watching it without knowing anything about the Higurashi visual novel will make you bang your head thinking what going on actually. But, if you bear with the unique story telling, you will find this series is really interesting.\r\nHigurashi has quiteamount of gore and suspense moment. So, be warned.

So I have decided to right one myself.\r\nFirst, I would like to say that this is not a bad anime it's just not a great anime. Yes, the mystery in this anime is good. Some of the episodes blew my mind when I found out parts of the whole story. But I have to say that the characters are really thin and not convincing. At first it didn't matter as much because thecharacters just seemed insane so anything crazy that they did was justified, but as the series progressed and the show started giving reasons for their craziness it became unbelievable because their logic didn't make any sense. Whenever something goes wrong the characters just assume that the best course of action is to kill first and then figure out the problem.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, by the end the horribly gruesome murders got kind of boring. I feel like the writers just tried to find a way for each character to kill off each other character and then developed a story.\\n\\n\r\nSo....I won't say don't watch this because the mystery in this series is pretty intense but don't expect to have any empathy for these characters by the end. The characters simple become thin. So, give the show a watch just don't blame me if you become a psychopathic killer.",

            "content": "Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni is one of my favorite animes of all time. It's not just of the terror and gore it delivers in its wonderful package, but more for the plot line itself. At first glance, you could say and most likely deny the actions of the main cast, but personally, I don't think that's possible. The show itself is just a simple reason not to judge at glance. Beneath the covers, it covers a dark, horrific and mysterious series, but at the same time, it could be a bit uplifting.\r\nThe story of this amazing series follows a high school student named KeiichiMaebara. He had recently moved to the small town of Hinamizawa, and it's not too long before he makes several friends in his class, which at first they seem all cute, innocent and overall happy. But he soon realizes that his seemingly harmless group of friends isn't so innocent as they may seem. What I really like about this anime, is it's very unique story structure. It is divided into \"question arcs\" and \"answer arcs\", all of them containing their own story and mystery, while giving great character development in the mix. Now, this is were one of its terrific qualities shine, as  the question arcs like to withdraw information. They do hint some clues, but it doesn't really tell you what is fully going on in the big picture. And the answer arcs are usually the question arcs, but told in another characters perspective. At first, I was a bit confused, especially in the beginning, but as I continued to watch I soon caught on to what was really going on and why the murders are happening at all.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation, it's nothing to get excited about. I found it pretty average throughout this series, but for some reason I found that it could have done a lot better. I know Studio Deen isn't the best at animation, I've seen Jigoku Shoujo, Fruits Basket and Vampire Knight, so I know where I'm coming from. But I feel if it was a bit more detailed, I would have liked it a whole lot more than I already did. They use a particular kind of animation when they do this. It was like they were animation a romance anime. The style of the animation doesn't change went the show goes into their dark roots and portray the characters as evil they possibly can. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the characters for this series are great, all of which have amazing back stories. All of them ranging from abuse to death of a family member and other wonderful things. The main cast of this show was really well done(for the most part, I did have times where I wanted to slap a character, but still) All of the characters put on a well, established personalities. Most of them were likable and were relate able and that's what I see in a good character or cast. At one point, one could be the main antagonist of the arc and in the next they could be a simple victim, which defiantly works for this anime a lot. It makes it more jarring than it already is in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound for Higurashi was great in the music department. Where it really shines, however, is the more depressing and mysterious music in the background. Not to mention the sound of a cicada makes the whole thing even better, because during the series, I was on the edge of my seat. For the VA's, I would have to go with the subbed rather than the dub. There were a few voices that I did like(Keiichi, Mion and Shion's were my favorites)and some that I didn't. I didn't enjoy Rika's, Satako's, and Rena's voice. I mean they could have gotten someone to do it better. I've listened to Yuki Cross's VA in Vampire Knight English Dubbed and I didn't like it at all, there is proof there if you know what I mean. The VA's were trying to act cute and innocent, but didn't achieve to the standards of VA's who can do that \"correctly\"(ex. Luci Christian).\\n\\n\r\nAs I stressed a lot of its's qualities, there are some things I didn't like about this anime, besides the voice acting in the dubbed version. I didn't like the fact that it the second season to this anime was not as great. The second season was really good, in fact I kept wanting to watch it because how good I thought it was. What I'm saying is that it was inferior to the first. In the first, there was a lot of terror and gore. The second season is more turned down on that factor and it turns more into a thriller rather than a horror. I wish it could have stayed in it's genre, but it was to continue and finish the story, which I didn't mind at the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is a wonderful series to check out if you are into a mystery shows. But I warn, this is not for everyone, as it displays a lot of frightful psychological insanity. I would suggest getting prepared before entering the hole that is this anime is. Needless to say, I recommend this to anyone who can put up with a lot of fear, because that is what you will be feeling once you finish. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

The anime very much shows all the endings from the visual novel and did a pretty good job on adapting it.\r\nalthough it is listed as horror i don't find this anime scary at all, the amount of gore in this anime is nothing compared to real gore anime. the story can get pretty interesting from episode 1to end, it is recommended you watch both seasons or else you will not understand what the heck is going on.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has inspired many other series such as madoka magica of the reborn concept. While watching this anime you should try your best to look at every bit of detail and try to understand it or else it will turn into a mind-fuck fest.\\n\\n\r\nthe anime might seem to be quite old now but overall its still pretty enjoyable. this is the sort of anime that act like innocent at start then it becomes dark afterwards.",

            "content": "Let's be honest for a moment here. Anime often relies on cliches. It's just a fact. Needless to say, as with most things that are repetitive, these cliches eventually get tired. I wanted an original story that didn't rely on cheap thrills to keep the viewer engaged. Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni did just that by renewing my faith in anime and as an otaku. \r\nWhat makes this show so special? Two things: characterization and storytelling. \r\nThe true genius in this anime is that it plays rather like one of those \"choose-your-own-adventure\" books you used to read as a kid. The anime consists of multiplestory arcs that all start out the same, but end differently. It shows you the events of a story arc from one perspective leaving many questions unanswered, then it shows you them again from a different perspective, revealing how the scenario really played out. While each of these story arcs could be a stand-alone series, the story arcs parallel each other, revealing more about the other scenarios with each arc watched. It's really unlike anything else out there, and, in my opinion, is sheer genius. \\n\\n\r\nThe second thing that sets this anime out from the crowd is the believable characters. You can connect an sympathize with every single character in the show, and your heart aches whenever one of them is killed. Also, I don't want to spoil any of the story for you, but there is something truly horrifying in the way these seemingly innocent characters transform into murderous psychos in the blink of an eye.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Unique storytelling\\n\r\n+Believable characters\\n\r\n+Creepy\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Bad dubbing (watch subbed)\\n\r\n-Animation could have been a bit better\\n\\n\r\n9/10",

            "content": "Higurashi season 1 is a flawed gem. Be warned that you'll see the flaws, much much before you realise that you are looking at a gem. The character design is awful, the characters themselves are stereotyped cliches, the attempts at humour and levity are cringe-worthy and the voice acting is mediocre at best, jarring and clumsy at worst. Even the shocking moments the series is known for barely will manage to raise eyebrows a couple times, if you have seen almost any modern anime.\r\nEven the story is seemingly disappointing. A series of arcs of varying quality repeating the passing of same two weeks over andover, while some characters and events apparently change radically between them. However, that's where the genius of the script comes in: towards the end of the last arc, a small revelation put the whole series in a new perspective and as understanding dawns, you cannot help but awe at its cleverness. Moreover, the delivery revelation was not a lengthy, ham-fisted exposition as it's often the case; a few seconds of previously seen footage with but a few words and all of a sudden, all pieces fall into place.\\n\\n\r\nIn sum: throughout the series you may wonder why you are still watching it and consider dropping it. Don't. The pay-off is entirely worth it.",

            "content": "This anime is about a group of crazy demented lolis that secretly rule a town out in the country. In the cover of this anime it shows 4 of the girls secretly planning to torture you, light you on fire, leave you naked and bloody on the ground dead, hanging you, pushing you off a cliff, smiling creepily at you till you start to go insane and kill people, and a number of things. Anyways lets get to the actual opening of this review.\r\nThis anime is a horror and a mystery. It has multiple arcs in it that eventually intertwine with each other. You willget multiple perspectives as each arc goes to a different loli and boy. The story goes that the town has a curse and that curse is enacted once a year during the festival.  I mainly want to talk about the characters because thats the best part, but I'll do this review in order anyway.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 7/10\\n\r\nThe story is a great setting for the arcs. The story in general is not all that creepy on the outside, but the more in-depth that you get, the more you want to wet your pants.\\n\\n\r\nART 7/10\\n\r\nThe humor in this show is mainly done by the art. The funny faces along with the voices really make this show hilarious (when it is not being creepy loli mode) The fact that the girls change from funny loli to I'm going to kill everyone loli is quite breathtaking.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 10/10\\n\r\nI can't think of a single bad thing about the sound. The opening really sets the mood. All the other music helps establish the atmosphere well. It would not be a very good anime without this ost. The sound effects and the voices are well done as well: from laughing to laughing dementedly as you slash into someones arm.\\n\\n\r\n(Oh boy here it comes!)\\n\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS!!! 10/10!!!!!!!\\n\r\nOk where to I begin, I suppose I will list them in the order in which this site has them listed in the \"Characters & Staff\" tab.\\n\\n\r\nRika Furude\\n\\n\r\n-Probably the youngest loli (idk they all seem the same age minus body type)\\n\r\nShe cries niipah! When she is about to kill. Its a battle cry that causes you to lower your defences so she can attack. She is subtle in her approaches though because she doesn't have secret torture chambers, or hidden baseball bats to kill with.\\n\\n\r\nSatoko Houjou!\\n\\n\r\n-Perhaps the most annoying loli?\\n\r\n-She cries on her freetime when she isn't trying to kill. She enjoys trapping humans and eating them for breakfast and then using the bones from them to make more traps and then eat them again. Its a never ending process.\\n\r\nPranking is another hobby of hers where she likes to taunt poor Keiichi until he comes at her with a baseball bat. She also likes to make Shion angry, she gets off when she is kicked alot. She has a special relationship with her brother that borders on the erotic. (just like all the other lolis apparently.)\\n\\n\r\nKeiichi Maebara\\n\\n\r\n-You can consider him the pimp of this loli town.\\n\r\n-He spends his time prancing around in a maid costume and on some days he wears makeup. Usually in the form of cat whiskers, and eye shadow, but when he uses eye shadow he often gets confused and it becomes a mess. (watch first episode around 18:20 to 19:25)\\n\r\n-Hes got some balls too. Keiichi is just something else. I think there is something wrong with him since it fails to realize the dangers that he puts himself in until its to late. Moving on:\\n\\n\r\nRena Ryuuguu\\n\\n\r\n-Rena stands on telephone polls looking for something cute. When she shes something cute she screams KAWAIIIIIIIIII as she swoops down and picks it up, taking it home to her bus with her.\\n\r\n-The creepiest thing about this girl is the way she views things that are cute, she automatically thinks she owns them and starts screaming, I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU HOME. Whenever I see this I'm like \"Can't you see shes a crazy loli!! run you stupid idiot! don't let her get you!!!\" But anyway, Rena is amazing because she lives in a bus in the dump. There she collects kawaii things that she gathers and puts them on display in her bus. In her bus she rocks back and forth in the fetal position screaming KAWAIIIIII while looking at her cute stolen objects. She is also very skilled with sharp blades. Moving on.\\n\\n\r\nShion Sonozaki\\n\\n\r\n-She the one without the ponytail!\\n\r\n-I figured that out about halfway in the show and it cleared alot of things up xD. Only to make it more confusing though, since the twins like to switch position with each other, anyway.\\n\r\n-As far as hobbies go, she enjoys extreme manicures and torturing. By extreme I mean she polishes those things until they are gone (if you have seen the anime.... you know) By torturing I mean torturing herself and others. She is not very good with the elderly since she tends to \"accidentally\" kill them every time she gets her hands on them. This is a hard character to describe without spoiling things, but she might be the craziest loli.\\n\\n\r\nMion Sonozaki\\n\\n\r\n-She is the other twin.\\n\\n\r\nMamoru Akasaka\\n\\n\r\n-He is a legend since he is one of the few people to actually meet the lolis and live. He spends his days talking to little girls.\\n\\n\r\nChie Rumiko\\n\\n\r\n-Who knows how many blind eyes this teacher has turned.\\n\\n\r\nSatoshi Houjou\\n\\n\r\n-The Nii-Nii of satoko. This young man hates his relatives and goes out of his way to either kill them or drive them crazy. He has a baseball bat license, which means he can buy various types of baseball bats to either crush, smash, or clobber people with. Its ok, hes licensed. He keeps this baseball bat at the school since he needs loli insurance.\\n\\n\r\nTeppei Houjou\\n\\n\r\n-He has good fashion sense\\n\\n\r\nToshiki Inukai\\n\\n\r\n-He is in episode 14\\n\\n\r\nIrie Kyousuke\\n\\n\r\n-The doctor of the village. He has a crazy loli fetish for Satoko and takes pictures of her. Him and Rena would get along if they tried.\\n\\n\r\nKasai Tatsuyoshi\\n\\n\r\n-This action hero is the James Bond of the village. He creeps around at night in his black suit and wear-all-the-time sunglasses to spy on the little girls. This would explain his extensive knowledge of each loli's lifestyle. He spends his free time watching Shion sleep.\\n\\n\r\nKimiyoshi Kiishirou\\n\\n\r\n-He is actually asleep for the entirety of the anime. He fools people because he sleep talks and walks. You never see him open his eyes.\\n\\n\r\nRina Mamiya\\n\\n\r\n-Poor lady gets herself involved with lolis\\n\\n\r\nOoishi Kuraudo\\n\\n\r\n-This overweight police officer spends most of his time in the car eating. Since he is the oldest male that is not a geezer, it is safe to assume that his diet consists of the secret ingredient found in the people that are killed by lolis that keep you from reaching an age in which you start losing your fat.\\n\r\n-The only reason he is named Ooishi is because he makes an Ooooo noise when he moves outside his car because he hates leaving his car (his food is in the car) and he hates the heat (because he has to much insulation).\\n\r\n-His hobbies include talking to little girls and little boys, eating, introducing himself to Keiichi, and looking at dead bodies.\\n\\n\r\nOryou Sonozaki\\n\\n\r\n-Gravity has been cruel to this poor woman's face. She worships demons at night and earth's gravity during the day. This why she is called Oni-baba (demon hag)\\n\\n\r\nSonozaki Mom\\n\\n\r\n-She is the mother of the twins and perhaps the least interesting character in the show.\\n\\n\r\nMiyo Takano\\n\\n\r\n-She lights herself on fire on her free time. She also has a conspiracy complex in which she believes irrational theories are being plot against her. She lists them in her journal.\\n\\n\r\nLast but definitely not least there is Jirou Tomitake\\n\\n\r\n-This guy is my favorite character of all time. He has more deaths than Krillin and Yamcha combined. The first thing he does when he gets to the village is die.\\n\r\n-As soon as I see him come on screen theres in a voice in my head screaming, run Jirou! you're going to be first!\\n\r\n-Half way through the anime I find him quite comical, his lack of screentime and immediate death I think were meant to replace the lack of comedy later in the series, as things got really serious.\\n\r\n-No one cares when he dies except for Keiichi, but Keiichi is paranoid and wears makeup and sometimes dresses as a maid, who cares what he thinks.\\n\r\n-He dies alot.\\n\r\n-He is listed in my favorite characters list because he is such a trooper. No matter how many times he dies, he will come back and try to take pictures again, making is feeble existence seem even more pathetic. He is also Ooishi's main diet since he dies first and Ooish needs food.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was crazy loli fun.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you like a good horror, but do not mind the switching of arcs (because it can get kind of uninteresting seeing things repeated) this is an amazing anime for you. You do not know the definition of crazy loli until you watch this.\\n",

This series never manages to disappoint.\r\nHigurashi does that thing, that trick, where it starts of easy, peaceful, simple, heartwarming, and calm but instantly changes when the smallest mistake happens. It can go from sweet and innocent, to the most unexpected, horrific, gore-filled, disastrous outcome you could possibly think of in less then 15 minutes.\r\nHigurashi reminds me a lot of a RPG in the sense that thesmallest thing always changes the whole outcome of the story. Higurash has multiple story arks in the series, resetting from the very start everytime the inevitable bloodbath of all our beloved characters takes place, usually ending the current story ark. If you take the RPG example again, and factor it into the scenario, it's essentially like starting a new game and trying to get a new ending. The start is always the same, but the events change, always leaving you asking, \"I wonder who's going to got bat-s**t crazy this time around.\" \\n\\n\r\nHigurashi is by far one of the most gory, stomach twisting series I've seen. If someone told you otherwise...you're sadly mistaken. Even if you go into in preparing yourself for the worst, you'll never see anything coming when it does. It leaves you in the dark until the perfect moment arises. It never fails to surprise.\\n\\n\r\nAs for animation, Higurashi has relatively decent animation but nothing to spectacular. Compared to other anime realised in 2006 (take Death Note for example) it doesn't exactly match in quality. I'm not saying the animation is awful, it's not, but it doesn't look as good as some others. It has its moments, but it's nothing to special, but it's not bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in Higurashi though is considerably better. It's been a few months since I finished both season one, and two, so my memory is a little murky, but the soundtracks I remembered where very nicely done. They always fit perfectly with the current situation and setting, which is always a major \"make it, or break it\" factor for things like horror/mystery series like this.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, voice acting. The voice acting for Higurashi is also very nicely done. The actors all portrayed their characters and situations well. No complaints on that part.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I think that concludes my full review of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. I hope you found this somewhat helpful and enjoyable! ^^",

However I was not sure whether I should watch this one or not.\r\nThe reason was that I heard this anime is very cruel, full of blood and violence. Yea I don't mind uncensored scenes like that but you know everything has it's limits.\r\nIt is not necessary to talk about that any further so let's go straight to the point. I completed this anime. :D Have to say that despite the violence (committed by and on little cute girls) thisanime was very valuable piece. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime made me think about the events in there for hours :D. At first you may think oh what the hell did I start to watch? But when \"everything\" is slowly uncovered I was just staring on the screen with opened mouth.\\n\\n\r\nSo for everyone who don't mind a bit of blood in anime, don't be afraid and watch it with opened mind. Some scenes are very forceful and scary but they make the story even more serious and awesome.",

This is the first anime i truly watched as an adult and is what got me into anime as much as i am today. The music, the characters, the ambiance and the suspense truly make this one of the most remarkable animes in the psychological horror/mystery genre. And to this day (considering i have seen almost all animes in this genre at this point) i STILL rate this the number one best. i recommend this anime to anyone who likes horror/mystery and things that really leave you second guessing everything about your self and the characters you watch on screen.",

            "content": "Story 9: Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni had a very unique way of telling its story, though it is not for everyone. The short scenarios worked for me because it offered good stopping places after just a few episodes, unlike most shows where I usually have to stop when something interesting happens and I can't stop thinking about it (which is intentional I guess). The overall story was fantastic in my opinion and the ending was done very well.\r\nArt 7: The art in Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni I thought was about average at first but the show unsettled me for some reason and ittook me a while to find out why. This was due to the character designs, the way they looked was unsettling to me because of how small their necks were but it took me a while to notice. It fits the atmosphere of the show very well so it worked for me. Everything else in the show looked about average to me and nothing else really stood out.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6: Other than the opening song the sound didn't really stand out for me. I really enjoyed the opening song though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7:  The characters in Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni were nicely developed. Most of the characters were developed later in the show. I didn't like Keiichi though mainly because I couldn't relate to him but he wasn't a bad character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10: I had a lot of fun with this show. I liked the mystery part of the show and I liked the scenario aspect of it. I couldn't wait to watch the next episodes of this show, and the plot twists in Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni were amazing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9: This is definitely a show worth checking out if you love horror/mystery anime or if you really want to see a show with a unique way of telling a story. However if gore and brutal scenes bother you then you might want to pass on this show.",

            "content": "Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni is one of those series, in my mind, that is both addictive and very hard to like. As a writer, my knowledge of how to write a plot and how not to write a plot screams. As a viewer, I enjoy the mystery and the gore. I waver between loving this anime and loathing it.\r\nThe series has the base of a very, very good story. But it feels half-baked to me - for many episodes there is little to explaination about the \"curse\". I felt ripped off by this later when it became interesting. It was as if the firstfew episodes were filler, pulling in the viewer with blood and gore and a small story - the curse, and other simple elements - then later deciding that it had a plot. If the writer/producers of this series were trying to hint at a story behind it all, then they failed.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is some good to say about the series. It is definitely worth watching through the slow moments at the beginning. As the series progresses, the story becomes a bit more satisfying and we begin to see more sides of the story than \"character 'insert name' goes crazy and kills 'insert name' and 'insert name' in 'insert name' location\". Additionally, some of the scenes, when placed individually, are well thought out and gut wrenching.\\n\\n\r\nFor the reasons above, I give the story a 6. It has good roots, but needed to be expanded on more, and developed into a more concrete form. I give the art a 5, as it is rather generic. The sucks and weapon-hitting-target effects are very good, deserving a eight, although I did notice from time to time that the sounds were late (and I can do without the sound of rubber when someone is being choked). Characters are 7, I enjoyed it to a 9, and overall, in my eyes, Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni is worth a watch at a 8.",

This was due to a Japanese friend telling me about this amazing story that she was reading. I then decided to try and find out about it, and thus watched the anime, and have done so ever since a little of a year ago now, and obviously if it got me to watch anime almost everyday and start learning Japanese, it's a really good story as my friend said.\r\nStory: Perhaps because I had neverseen an anime I found the story unique. An alternative universe, a repeating June until finally being able to imprint a lasting memory and solve the mystery... it was such a fascinating tale, and the fact that it slowly became less about gore and into a soft and more meaningful story is something that I've realized is not often done. I recently saw \"Another\", and oh how hard did it try to make you scared, and all that ... it was sooooo lame when i was thinking of this story, in which the gore crazed school girls didn't last... I truly hope that there are more stories like this, if this gore genre must continue...\\n\\n\r\nArt: Excellent, very well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I don't remember any stand out music, but it all flt the bill as i remember.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  Some of the characters are somewhat lacking, but they are all quite likable and well written.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It's one of the best anime's I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would highly recommend this anime to anyone looking for an excellent story, gore, substance good characters, and a mystery that will make you drop all your work and watch it till the end.",

            "content": "Alright, so I haven't actually watched the rest of the series yet, so my opinion might change by the time I'm done. But I felt like I needed to write this review before starting on the rest of the series since my feelings about it are going to be VERY different by the time I'm done.\r\nStory: 8\r\nArt: 5\r\nSound: 10\r\nCharacter: 7\r\nEnjoyment: 9\r\nOverall: 9\r\nStory:\r\nThe first arc nearly made me want to put this down and come back to it later, purely because it didn't seem too interesting or unique. But the ending of the fourth episode definitely changed my viewpoint, and I found myself binging this andfinishing it in about two days. The arcs are all so different and unpredictable, and seeing how the characters acted differently in each was enticing, to say the least. I have to admit, though, that some arcs were too over-the-top to make much sense or be realistic, which detracted a little from my investment, but the problem there laid more with how some of the characters acted than with the story, so it's not something that I'll go too into detail here. This anime did, however, leave quite a lot to be desired, though I hear the second season takes care of that. This story does get a little complicated and confusing at times, but that's partially what makes it so intriguing. I honestly was a little disappointed in the horror aspect of this series. I feel like I would definitely describe this more as a mystery since that's what it felt like it was concentrating on more to me. So if you came here looking for a plethora of horror, I recommend watching something else.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I don't really think I need to elaborate much on this, but the art isn't the best, even for something that came from 2006. The character designs were pretty bland, and sometimes, some parts even looked a little awkward (mostly the hair, since it seems to strangely defy all gravity and physics, and the chibis, which for whatever reason felt very unproportionately drawn to me). The animation wasn't lacking however, and overall, the art style didn't detract from the story whatsoever, especially since you get used to it very quickly. Overall, not a reason to not give this anime a go.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Alright, I don't know much about sound, but usually in anime, I don't really give the soundtrack/music much attention. But this soundtrack was, in my opinion, truly a masterpiece, since it stood out to me notably multiple times throughout the show, something that nearly never happens. The soundtrack just fit the scenes perfectly, and it adds IMMENSELY to the overall vibe and feel of the scene; I actually got shivers multiple times down my spine purely because of it. Since this is a horror, sounds are especially important, and this anime seems to know this and give a lot of attention to them as a result. The opening was amazing and was somehow just the right mix of creepy and alluring, and the voice actors were pretty great as well, though nothing too memorable compared to some others that I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Overall, the characters were good, and they were quite enjoyable. I actually quite liked the mc, which boosted this score immensely, since a bad mc is probably one of the fastest ways to get me to drop an anime. The character interactions were interesting, especially with how vastly different they were with every arc and yet somehow remained the same at their very core. I appreciated the character development that they gave the characters considering they're such a significant part of the story, but I have to say, everything with the characters always just fell a little... short. Even though these characters weren't shallow and actually quite likable, it felt like they were built up with a lot of potential that was just never explored. Quite a shame.\\n\r\nThat, however, isn't my main problem with the characters - the main problem I had was the ridiculously unrealistic way they acted in certain episodes. While it was interesting seeing the different characters act differently in different arcs, sometimes, their actions were more believable than in others. Sometimes the mc, Keiichi, acted like Kazuma from Konosuba (intelligent and likable) while at others, he was just as bad as Yukiteru from Mirai Nikki (illogical and idiotic). This wasn't just a problem with Keiichi, however; this problem is prevalent with ALL the characters. It really ruined some of the arcs for me and came close to ruining my favorite, but since this is really only prevalent in about a 1/4 of the series and, even then, only at certain moments, it's quite overshadowed by the quality of the story and the character's actions in other circumstances, so it's not honestly not too big of a deal.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I IMMENSELY enjoyed this anime. As a mystery, it operates amazingly well and  is structured in such a complex and yet entertaining way that make it feel refreshing and unique. The constant what-ifs of the series and the way it manipulates and takes advantage of the flexibility the story offers took me by surprise quite a few times, and in a good way. Definitely one of those shows that you will be unable to put down until you're done with.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: While I can't really say much about this series being a horror, the mystery aspect was definitely explored very thoroughly and written in a thought-provoking way. This series is definitely building up to something, and you can most definitely sense that it is going to be good. The art is mediocre and bland, but nothing that detracts from the series, so it's not something to give much attention to. The soundtrack was amazing and really made some scenes for me, and the opening was quite memorable as well. The voice actors were nothing special, but they did a pretty great job. The characters had some moments that made me think that the writers had no idea what their personality was like or what common sense even was, and though they could have had a bit more development, overall, they were pretty interesting and well-rounded. I immensely enjoyed the anime, and it had me invested all the way through, wanting to know what happens next and how everything links together. Overall, this anime is definitely worth a watch, and it most likely is going to make it on your list of the most memorable animes, if not on your list of favorites.",

            "content": "This is my first review, so I apologize for possible inaccuracies.\r\nHigurashi is a must-watch for fans of the horror genre. It is filled with gore, psychological horror, and will confuse you in a way that will keep you watching until the very last episode.\r\nStory 9/10- Higurashi is more of a collection of stories then one basic plot. Each story tends to start out slow having an episode where it just focuses on the characters messing around, but no matter how stupid it may seem it will almost always introduce something important, like a character who will play a big role in the future, or somethingmight happen between two characters which will be the origin of a series of violent acts. After the slow start, the series wont waste any time to mess around, it becomes fast pasted, full of plot twists, and will leave you extremely confused. The stories may be similair in plot but you never feel bored  just because youve felt you've seen it before, since each story is presented in a different way and each time you will get a chance to learn new things about the characters.\\n\r\n     The plot usually takes place a short while after the main character, Keiichi, has just moved to a town called Hinamizawa. Each year in Hinamizawa there's an event called the cotton drifting festival, and each year on the same night as the cotton drifting festival, someone is found dead, and another found missing. But as the plot continues your focus seems to somewhat drift away from the festival and focuses more on the events happening between the characters and how the events from each story tie together.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/animation 3/10- I found this to be the downside of Higurashi as the animation was dull amd could sometimes be so awful I couldn't even look without cringing. The lighting wasn't brilliant either since horror series tend to have more of a darker lighting, but Higurashi's didn't really do much with it. I usually don't judge shows based on artwork, but I feel it's important for horror shows, since it usually adds to the eerie aspect.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10- Higurashi has one of the most beatiful openings I've heard and goes with the series perfectly. I can't really say much on the voice acting except for the laughter. I found the kaughter to be the scariest part of the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10- The most interesting part of the series was watching the characters fall into insanity. Not only that, the characters were going through problems that anyone could relate to, some more traumatic than others, such as child abuse and betrayal. Each character developed as we learned their backstory(except for one who remains a mystery) and they all played their role in story. It also will occasionally switches the main character and we get to see events unfold from other perspectives.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10- Another downside in the series was how poorly executed some of the scenes that were supposed to be creepy were, the music would go all dramatic yet there would be no tension because of the way it was presented. But that and the art were the onle problems. As some scenes weren't creepy didn't mean there weren't ones that were downright terrifying. Each episode confused me more and more and the tension in some places was so high I had to pause and go get a snack to calm myself down.\\n\\n\r\n With pyschological content that will disturb you and near impossible to solve mystery's. I reccomend this to any fan of horror or mystery.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It's quite an odd one.\r\nThe story is told from different views (arcs). So something different happens in each arc.\r\nIt is very violent at some parts, there's some medival torture scenes and general violence. (Which I thought was the best part, since it was quite scary!)\r\nThe characters are also very interesting. They are all quite secretive about their past. And the local villagers don't like talking about their pasts. ( Mion, Rena, Satuko, Rika.) \r\nThere was a terrible incident before the main characterKeiichi (main character) came along, and the villagers pretend that they don't know anything, and don't want to talk about it. This is where the plot starts and it begins to get interesting.\\n\\n\r\nA very good anime, probably my favourite one. \\n\r\nI won't go into any more detail, otherwise, I'll get carried away and tell the whole story line. ^ ^ ;\\n\\n\r\nOne thing to say..\\n\r\nWatch it!\\n\\n\r\n(Sorry if I accidentally wrote any spoilers, I hope I haven't. ^ ^ ;\\n\r\nArigato.)",

            "content": "\" The horror...the horror...\" - Col. Walter Kurtz, Apocalypse Now.\r\nIf there is any form of entertainment out there whether it be books, movies, anime or comics that need something to spark an inspiration for how they should tell a story to their audience. To have them constantly wondering, to have them second guess the people involved, to have the shit scared out of them so bad that they lie awake at night thinking \"my god...that was not only the most terrifying experience of my life, that was the most well structured piece of storytelling I have ever seen.\" Then they should look at Higurashi (Whenthey Cry.) \\n\\n\r\nThe absolute brilliant thing that When the Cry did for me was how I was able to re-watch it three times and even though I knew it was coming, was still creeped out by the scary stuff. But was also able to figure other stuff out that I wasn't able to the other viewings.  The fact that I can watch it so many times and know what is exactly going to happen but still find something new out is brilliant storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a small village of Hinamizawa and its endless cycle of blood and violence in the year of 1983. Maebara Keiichi has just moved in. He befriends a group from his school, the shy and quite Rena, the loud mouth boss-like Mion and two younger girls cat like Rika and another quite type Satako. It all seems well for Keiichi, until the annual cotton drifting festival comes around and Keiichi's world turns for the worse. And this all happens about five different times!\\n\\n\r\nIf you didn't fully understand what I meant in that last part, the show is split into different arcs that tell different sides the story involving the other characters and introducing new ones. The point is these reviews on this site are not gonna be enough, I can give you endless descriptions of this show like \"It's groundhog day with killer little kids\"  but When they Cry is an anime that is not meant to be talked about until it is watched Going into more detail would only ruin what I consider to be a classic not just among anime, but just a classic in general. \\n\\n\r\nTake care everyone. \\n\\n",

This was the first horror/suspense that I've seen out of any anime and I enjoyed it quite a bit, although hopefully this doesn't spoil it, don't think it will, but the ending... all I saidfor 10 minutes was \"WTF!\" after it was over.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were voiced well and just the suspense of all of them left me on the edge of my seat, as well as the story.

Oh, and if you don't know what I'm talking about, yes, it's that mind-blowing).\r\nThe art is average, so it's a five... ya know, half good half bad... yeah.\r\nCharacters don't experience development, but only to a very small level (they have small bursts of memory of eachworld, and some people won't know what I'm talking about, again). But we went deep into who each character is, but they're pretty stereotype with insane qualities underneath. I mean, Higurashi doesn't really deal with deep psychological themes on a realistic scale, but yeah, it does deal with psychological themes.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it so much, I wish I could erase my memory and rewatch it again, just to kill my mind.

            "content": "((BTW: Yes,I know that I put 10 for everyone catagory. I LOVE HIGURASHI~!))\r\n5 words: Don't underestimate loli/moe girls\r\n-Story-\r\nThe thrilling anime spun from the mind of 7th Expansion, I personally thought Higurashi no Naku Koro ni (When the Cicadas Cry) was one of the best anime of '07.  With the concept of the mysterious Oyashrio-sama always watching over you and how that even little girls can turn out different then you originally expected is pretty clever. I must admit that When The Cicadas Cry is pretty confusing unless you pay close attention. The story's plot jumped from one moment to another, but was well thoughtout. \\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\\n\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro ni had amazing art animation and depiction. The fight scenes were pretty detailed down the every drop of blood splattered. The character designs actually were better than the manga's, but both designs were impressive. Aside from that, the scenery was spectacular in my opinion. What I didn't like about the art was that the artists didn't use a lot details on the minor characters. Anyway, the art overall was amazing to me.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\\n\r\nWhen I began watching When The Cicadas Cry, I immediatly noticed the epic music of the OP and ED songs, Eiko S. was an amazing singer and song writer and I was pretty impressed with her work. The intriguing music in the battle scenes were pretty intricate and fit the mood. To sum up the music and sound in Higurashi, it fit the entire image of the series.\\n\\n\r\n-Charatcer-\\n\\n\r\nIn one word: suspensful! Yes, crazy. When you watch Higurashi, you alway will begin to feel suspense when you start seeing the character creeping around town. The more you learn about the characters you more you feel amazed. Epic characters like Rika Furude and Rena &quot;Reina&quot; Ryuugu make the series feel &quot;complete&quot;. With their scary tactics, the characters always can end up giving you a fright.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment doesn't even begin to tell how much I fell in love with Higurashi. Every episode hooks you in more and more until you feel like you're experiencing the same moments the characters have. The way the story is told is quite wonderful and interesting to any horror fan. If you love horror, gore and cute-turned-crazy anime girls, you will definetly enjoy this series as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni was a very interesting and suspensful anime that I reccomend to ANY anime fan. Bt, heed this warning, if you are faint of heart and hate seeing blood and death, this series is NOT FOR YOU. Higurashi has kept me on the edge of my seat the entire series. If you enjoy When The Cicadas Cry as much as I do, please watch the sequels: Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai, the Higurashi Neko OVA and the new season coming season, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei! I guarentee that Higurashi will suit you taste.",

That's why this anime will always be my top 1, even tho Monogatari Series is my favourite.\r\nHigurashi's plot is one of the most fucked up things I've seen, but It's super well done and It really gets you into it... plus, If you checked my other reviews, I'm sure you know that I LOVE fucked up plots, huge mindfucks and colossal plot-twists, and Higurashi is all about those things. The Art-style sucks all of theass tho, even for It's time, but I can't say a thing since the VN is even worse in that aspect, but if you get passed that, the anime is amazing, and even for It's shitty art-style It has a really good animation.\\n\r\nAs I said, Higurashi is an horror anime, It's manga legitimately hit me with a jumpscare and shit, If you read it... I'm sure you know which chapter I'm talking about.\\n\r\nIf you love horror and mystery as much as I do and you don't really care that much about desing and that kind of stuff, you'll fall in love with Higurashi",

            "content": "*No Spoilers Here* \r\nWhat a great anime we have here.\r\nWhen I first started watching this I was a bit hesitant on whether or not I would enjoy this. I was mainly put off by the art in the anime. After watching this I haven't learn't not to judge an anime by looks and how long it has been around.\r\nHigurashi no Naku Koro ni (When they cry) was what I was looking for in a horror anime. It was the first anime that sent shivers down my spine and made me want to look away from the screen during some scenes. \r\nStory: Maebara Keiichi moves toa village that goes by the name of Hinamizawa. Hinamizawa is known for it's small population and horrifying secrects. Keiichi meets four girls, Mion Sonozaki, Satoko Houjou, Rika Furude and Rena Ryuugu. They become very close friends and Keiichi ends up joining their club at school. Peace comes to an end as Keiichi learns about the current and pass secrets of Hinamizawa. This is spilt up into six arcs that range from two to six episodes long.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Higurashi's art is pretty good. It definitely a lot different than current art styles in anime but it really was good. No heavy colours were used and the flow throughout the anime was superb.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I felt the voice acting was amazing, characters can go from being in a really good and jolly mood to sounding like they have muderous intentions. Background music was nice really went with the animation. The OP wasn't that bad, I skipped the OP for 11 episodes and then realized it wasn't that bad. The ED however I didn't like too much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: What I really like about the characters in this anime is that each of the main characters get an arc explaining their story and how it contributes to the main plot. If I had to pick a favourite character I would have to say Rika Furude was mine. She is so young and says the cutest things but if someone messes with her she has a whole different side to the cute little girl.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: To begin with I wasn't really interested in the first two or three episodes but after I really did have fun watching the anime. Each episode had a cliff hanger which lead me to wanting more and more. I'm a really big fan of mysteries and stuff that messes with your head and I think that is what really stood out about Higurashi.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you really are into the whole murder, mystery and psychological, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni is a must watch. \\n\\n\r\nFor all those who are wondering yes there is a sequel to Higurashi which i'm yet to watch but when I do I will definitely write a review on it!\\n",

            "content": "The moral of Higurashi: Good friends help you hide the bodies, bad friends are the bodies.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe overall plot tells me that the story follows Maebara Keiichi a boy who moved into a village that hides many past horror and future drama, together with his group of friends who can either turn into psychopaths or really good friends (the kind that help you hide the bodies) uncover the dark secrets behind Hinamizawa and Oyashiro-sama's curse.\r\nThe concept of this is possibly one of the most confusing for someone who would decide to turned on his anime casual mode (me for example) and watch this, the plotisn't something simple that you can graps right away but you can certainly mislead yourself by thinking that it's just an anime well cute girls kill each other because of... well, stuff.\\n\r\nOr, you can just think it as a far less lazy and alot more bloody Haruhi Suzumiya's Endless Eight. That being said, this series is divided into many arcs, some arc may seem similar to each other but in truth it's different choices and different point of view with a possible chance of the yielding the same result as the last time or more questions for the viewers or even answers. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art style certainly sticked to the VN adaption without making them looks like children with very big limbs, but then it's nothing special as the animation fail at some point in the series, in fact, I'd say it was sub-par in comparison to other series that was aired at the same time (Haruhi Suzumiya is a nice example but that series far exceeds it's timeline, animation-wise), I didn't really bother to review much about this anime first before watching it and at first I thought it was just a happy harem with a bunch of lolis but apparently I was taken by surprise to see... LOLIS DYING, ALOT OF LOLIS DYING. It is also worth to mention that if you are not used to art style like this it's going to take a few episodes for you to ignore/love it.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 7\\n\r\nFor this first season the soundtrack did not particularly stood out well in comparison to it's sequels, the main BGM (Main theme) actually sounds decent and fitting to the anime, though. Unfortunately, while I can see how other people says that the OP is beautiful, I cannot, mostly because I find that the voices changes far too often and it was a little too slow, but if you did bother to read the lyrics it really tells the story of the anime well, once again, the ending have very great lyrics but I do not enjoy the Engrish very much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nI love all of the characters, from the possible archetype tsundere Mion ,the yandere Rena, or the... well, fabulous Maebara Keiichi. How the anime begin to explore these characters never cease to not make me regret watching this at night. In one arc they're a psychopath and in the next they're the victim, and of course, at one point they also stick together and show My Little Pony what friendship really is, yea, take that bronies!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.5\\n\r\nLater on in the series as the story progress and the viewers start to symphathize or laugh with the characters, they also start to want more answers to every ending of a \"question\" arc, the viewers also start to make their own theories on the story, and just to make sure that they got it right, they'll keep watching. Whether it's joyful laughter from comic relief or maniacal laughter from slaughtering a character Higurashi did all of them, one of the many reasons why this series is a must watch for every horror lover.",

            "content": "I'm writing this review because I haven't seen very many negative ones for Higurashi, and just want to provide another point of view. For me, Higurashi was mediocre. I started it after going on a horror anime kick, and was expecting something exciting and horrifying (I had just finished Corpse Party and Another). And this anime disappointed in both senses.\r\nStory: I really can't accurately review the story, as I didn't finish the season, and the arcs are supposed to connect at the end. But what really matters to me is that it didn't keep me watching in the first place. Each arc had the samepace: everything is totally normal and then BAM girls doing f*cked up shit. It was too abrupt, too cliche. The arcs each start off the same way, and on the 3rd one I was thinking, \"I have to watch this shit again?\" The plot twists weren't surprising enough, the girls' actions weren't believable, and it just wasn't scary. I watched this at midnight and didn't feel a drop of fear. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Often, strange art styles can be overlooked if the anime excels in other aspects. And that's not the case with Higurashi. The strange, childish art just added to the annoyance of it. It didn't make it creepier; it just made it laughable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: If it couldn't get any worse, this anime is also kind of a harem anime. One guy, bunch of girls. Of course, romance isn't the focus, but it still perpetrates that stupid troupe of the guy and his bitches. And they're in middle school. \\n\r\nEach of the characters are perfect cliches. You have all the anime stereotypes: stupid guy, yandere, tsundere, moe, ect. So it's not like I care if any of them die. I can barely even stand watching them. Characters could have saved the story, but instead they put the final nail in the coffin. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is not good. Maybe the end is smart, maybe everything is tied together, but what does it matter if it's unwatchable? There's nothing to gain from this anime; it's not scary, interesting, or innovative. That's just my opinion. \\n",
