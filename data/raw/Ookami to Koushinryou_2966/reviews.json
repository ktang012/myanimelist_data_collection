            "content": "Wolf and spice can be summed up fairly easily. Be prepared for ALOT of dialog. In essence, its about a story about merchant trading during medieval times. A time when the word of the catholic church was more important than anything else and anyone else was deemed a witch or heretic. Since it is set in such archaic times it would be a perfect fit to have an anime about merchant trading.\r\nEver since i was in middle school I used to play video games with trading and how prices rise and fall from location to location and how supply and demand and even risk marginsfor investing in certain things to turn a profit. That was the main goal, to make money. And that is the main goal of our main character Lawrence Kraft. Through his travels he entrusted a small heretic town that believed in a wolf god named Horo that watched over their crops. And it just happens that Lawrence Kraft befriends this god and he soon finds out that she just wants to go home. And so the adventure begins....\\n\\n\r\nBeing a story about trading goods there is bound to be alot of dialog between bartering, negotiating, trading information and the chemistry between Horo and Lawrence. If theres going to be alot of dialog an my anime it better at least intelligent and make sense. Luckily this show does it very well, almost perfect. And its safe to say this is because how Horo and Lawrence feed off each others energies so well that you almost feel like you're right there arguing with Horo. Theres no &quot;voice in the head&quot; in this anime, all their thoughts and ideas go between each other and nothing is never left out. Although little background details are left out for time constraints, viewers with an open mind can understand most of the unmentioned side stories. Those who cant figure out the small things, the subbers (ayako) were nice to place side notes for every episode. Its very refreshing to see an anime that actually takes time to explain things to the point that you are convinced enough to believe the situation at hand. \\n\\n\r\nLawrence and Horo are the only main characters of the show so having a good chemistry between them was key but also having a strong seiyu cast for those two is another reason why this show is addicting. Their voices emit their emotions perfectly and the background music just makes this show so much more elegant and beautiful. Its basically consists of a string quartet. Who ever composed all of the background music must be one of the best composers I've ever heard. I never knew so many emotions can come out of just a group of strings. Environmental sound effects are just as what you would expect after hearing the beautiful strings and artwork. Crickets chirp at night, flames flicker and click, they're all of high quality. But they never interfere with the dialog at all which I enjoy the most. \\n\\n\r\nThe last component that brings this whole show to masterpiece status is the artwork. This show is best shown on HD resolution definitely. You can see all the painstaking detail it took for all the artists to draw all the settings of the medieval towns, each cobble stone looks different from each other, the stained glass is painted with perfect care. Even all the guild halls and churches have a massive feel to them. Everything about the artwork screams perfection and is easily one of the best artwork I've laid my eyes on. The character animations aren't as greatly skilled as  the background and static animations but it does hold a medium-high quality at best. But Horo and Lawrence are still quite memorable throughout the whole show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this show crams so much information and dialog to the viewers its easy to say that its not for everyone. But this is indeed a very intelligent, beautiful, and intriguing show. Its a show that you will either understand or not. As for me I love shows like this that leaves JUST enough out for the viewer to make them think and analyze about the episode they just saw. And I am a total sucker for beautiful artwork and music, but character chemistry is what drives me (and all my other 10's on my list) to score this a 10.\\n\\n\r\n...mind you this show still isn't for everyone. \\n\\n",

            "content": "This is a review of BOTH seasons of Spice and Wolf, but I have gone to great lengths to make it completely spoiler-free.\r\nPersonally, I believe Spice and Wolf's central theme to be a rephrasing of the saying 'Never judge the content by the cover'. The story is one of the most unique in anime, despite the presence of a naked wolf girl that would normally slap a bold 'FANSERVICE' stamp right across the middle. Spice and Wolf is inexplicable, to be honest. It's a medieval fantasy, but has nothing to do with swords and spellcraft, but rather trading and economics. If I try to explainthis in any further detail, I will risk adulterating the amazing experience that is the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, having watched the anime first, the light novels don't cut it (well-written as they are). Spice and Wolf isn't just beautiful in context to the (basic scaffolding of) a story, the world, the atmosphere, the narrative, or what I believe to be the greatest female lead of all time. It's one of the most visually and aurally appealing stories out there. Only three or four shows have made it into my top ten before I even completed the series, and this is one of them.\\n\\n\r\nAs has now become customary, I will proceed to rate the show on the subject of story, characters, its visual aspect, its aural aspect, and its overall entertainment value, plus any bonuses or deductions it might earn along the way.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Spice and Wolf is not exactly a story. It earns points for setting everything just right, but gives the story the freedom to be divided into arcs; most of which are thoroughly enjoyable, and the origin stories to provide background are well-written, but still enough to shroud the subjects in mystery, which I personally tend to favor. However, at times, the show becomes unnecessarily complicated, resulting in convoluted storylines revolving around arbitrary trading escapades, which might bore viewers who aren't fascinated by the subject of economics (and I am yet to find those who are). However, this is but a tiny imperfection in a masterwork.\\n\r\nI hereby award the story with an 8 out of a possible 10. However, a more realistic portrayal medieval world is something I greatly value, as seen on George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire, and that gives it a one point bonus to result in a final rating of a 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are some of the best I've ever encountered. Holo is probably one of the greatest characters of all time, and undoubtedly my favourite female lead in all fiction. Lawrence is also a brilliant character, with quirks and eccentricities and a keen intellect, but not without flaws. It only makes it better that his English voice is the same as that of Okabe Rintarou from Steins;Gate, my favourite male lead, who also happens to share a slew of character traits with Lawrence. I hate to say this, but some characters come across as lazy and one is a little too Moe-influenced for my liking. If not for the sheer brilliance of the lead characters' performance, I would deduct an entire point for the few bad characters there are. However, I cannot find it in myself to do so.\\n\r\nI award the characters of this show with a 9.5 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals of Spice and Wolf aren't overly extravagant, but are beautiful, and manage to capture the setting of a medieval world (without an emphasis on huge gilded swords and dragons) perfectly. The visuals in the second season, due to the change in the animation studio, are a tad more outlandish, but still carry much of the same flair.\\n\r\nThe visuals of Spice and Wolf earn a 9.5 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nNow, moving on to the aural aspect.\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf's music is beautiful, it's opening is one of my favorites to date, and the lengths the studio went to in order to incorporate medieval instrumentation into the soundtrack really paid off. Tracks like the initial score to the festival in Pasloe or the more fast paced Zawazawa Suru, or even the tracks that add to the suspense of the show when it's required really hit home.\\n\r\nI award the aural aspect Spice and Wolf an 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nI would be remiss if I did not, at this point, mention the show's opening sequences, both of which are rather spectacular and definitely are a credit to the show's sound and animation departments. On that note-\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of bonuses, there is one thing that Spice and Wolf has that earns it an enormous sack of brownie points; the dub. Aye, Spice and Wolf boasts what is, in my opinion, one of the greatest dubs of all time, and is comparable to the likes of Cowboy Bebop and Steins;Gate. The Japanese voice simply cannot do justice to the character of Holo herself, much less Brina Palencia's impeccable portrayal of her. J. Michael Tatum as Lawrence is, as I might have mentioned, a perfect match. The dub and openings are so utterly spectacular that I award not one bonus point, but two, resulting in a final rating of the aural aspect; 11 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the show's entertainment value;\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf is my favourite show for a reason; the characters. No matter how convoluted and frustratingly intertwined the stories get, you can always divert your attention to the main characters and their interactions, which is what the show really is about. Although it goes without saying that the story will have its impact on everything, and at times is good enough to turn your head in its direction, and then weaving itself in with the MASTERFUL character development to create something truly amazing. I hereby award the entertainment aspect of Spice and Wolf with a 9 out of a possible 10. However, it gets a one-point deduction; letting it drop at the end of the second season with a half-baked finale (whereas the ending of the first season was conclusive enough to serve as a true finale) seals its fate in stone as naught but promotional material for the light novels, however good as it may be. Hence, the aspect of entertainment gets an 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't fine-tuned these ratings as much as I normally would, but I didn't want to analyse the show at such a critical level as to end up sullying the experience for a prospective audience.\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf earns an overall rating of 9.4/10, and a personal recommendation that comes with my three favourite anime series' of all times; right alongside Steins;Gate and Cowboy Bebop.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I would like to say that if by any chance a third season were to be announced, the rating would instantly increase to a perfect 10. However, if it does what the second season did, I the overall rating of the franchise might drop down a notch to a 9.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this was a satisfactory overview.",

            "content": "A show about a merchant and an incarnation of a harvest-wolf-god, set in a beautiful medieval world.\r\nSo, a merchant named Lawrence encounters the incarnation of the harvesting god - a wolf god at that. Her incarnation looks like a human except wolf ears and the tail to match. Then, he's supposed to accompany her to her home country in the north. On top of that, it's all set in a medieval setting. That's pretty interesting, if you ask me. It lays the base for a good adventure anime; which I definitely like.\r\nThis show doesn't have a vast array of main characters - it's mainly Lawrenceand Horo (the wolf-god) so far. Well, they're both good characters, and I especially like how Horo is a contrast in herself: She is pretty smart, and wise - as she says herself several times - at times. Still, she can be pretty child-like, and has a personality that doesn't really indicate wisdom or smartness.\\n\\n\r\nLawrence is, well, a pretty average main character, I think. I don't really have much to say about him. There's one thing I don't like, however: They both try to act though towards each other, hiding their feelings. Or something like that. Anyway, I am pretty tired of seeing that, even though it's turning into a standard part in a recipe for this kind of anime.\\n\\n\r\nAh, and I really like the setting of the show, as I mentioned earlier: A medieval world. I find it really awesome to watch this show with its medieval feel - I've always been a sucker for that.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this can turn into a pretty good show. I'm going to recommend this to all of you adventure anime fans out there. However, it can be pretty confusing in the first episodes - I'm just starting to understand it after thinking a bit about it. But that may just be me, so watch it yourselves!\\n\\n\r\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)",

            "content": "A sensory description accompanied by fields of gold swaying as the west wind moves. A reference to a European legend so obscure most people living where the legend was current will have never heard of it, and well-used to boot. A depiction of change, of progress and of its accompanying alteration of people's perception. All in a preamble spoken in a soft voice.\r\nHow could this not turn out to be brilliant?\r\nWhen discussing Spice and Wolf, the very title of the series is of interest. More particularly, the sequence of the words of that title. Whereas the Japanese original should have produced the sequence 'Wolf andSpice', the reverse is used in the English title; both sequences are used when people talk about the series. The very preference of one sequence of the title's elements over the other might very well show which such element is more important to the viewer. Equally, it will probably betray appreciation of the show as a whole, as one of the two elements is clearly inferior to the other.\\n\\n\r\n-= Wolf =-\\n\r\nOne way of looking at this series is to see it as a traveller's tale, perhaps even one of a budding romance: a story of two companions trekking from place to place to reach their goal and becoming more firm friends with each bump in the road - bumps that are present, partly as that's how roads are, but mostly as a method of giving the travellers something to struggle with and to overcome.\\n\r\nSuch a view can easily enough be taken, since both protagonists, travelling merchant Kraft Lorenz and his companion Holo, have a penchant of running into trouble at each way stop, either of their own making or by coincidence and plot-convenience, and especially since theirs is an age-old adventure tale, a tale of crossing a continent while finding one's way home. The particular angle from which Spice and Wolf looks at this story is noteworthy, though.\\n\\n\r\nKraft Lorenz is one of the more unusual characters concepted within the entirety of anime and manga. A travelling trader owning little but his own horse and carriage and dreaming of making enough money to open a shop, he is hardly an archetypal hero. Nor is he concepted to become one. The focus of his character and his actions lie squarely on his business. A generally upright and decent, if competitive, man, his is a less than overly adventurous life of trying to strike a good deal and staving off bankruptcy, trading in commodities and making the best of opportunities encountered by favourable exchange rates or the novelty of trading on credit. At first glance it may not be the most exciting of lives to watch, but it is made up for by the detail poured in each individual transaction and the worries they bring to someone whose very survival hinges on the successful deal.\\n\r\nThere is also the little fact that he has made a promise to a spirit of an age past, letting this spirit travel with him and helping her search for her far-off home for as long as their routes overlap. His motivation is partly one of expedience, partly one of awe, and partly one of wishing for a companion on the road.\\n\r\nWhile Lorenz is simply a character who is able to assess and laugh about himself and who never strays too far from the path of weighing all his options and usually acting from his thoughts instead of his emotions (somewhat rare in itself), only being overcome at times by the greed his profession might by necessity entail, Holo is what, to many, makes the show memorable.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, there's her concept. She's a 'Roggenwolf', a wolf-spirit from folk legend who was a protector of the rye fields and the harvest; the legend depicted in the anime, including the idea that the wolf hides in the last sheaf of rye, comes directly from the actual legend (although the anime most likely speaks about barley, not rye - it's hard to tell, with 'mugi' meaning barley as well as rye and wheat). But Spice and Wolf adds to this simple notion, mentioning how she agreed to be present in the fields in days when the success of the harvest depended on the whims of nature and the supernatural, only to be forgotten when progress and developing technology made her antiquated, until she roused herself from her placidity, longing to return to her old home, a semi-mythical place where everything was bathed in a brilliant silver.\\n\r\nA being who is not human, Holo is shown to enjoy the marvels of the human world with all the lack of solicitude of a child. Seeing herself as better than humans, she is a trickster, toying with whatever interests her, shown to like mind-games, wittiness and swiftness in conversation, all the while seemingly thoroughly enjoying being pampered, being treated to large amounts of alcoholic beverages and socialising.\\n\r\nWhile this might make her likable, perhaps even charming, it doesn't make her stand out as a character. What does manage to do so is the fact that, every now and again, without too much attention being piled on it, she, and the audience with her, is reminded of the fact that she is, in truth and not only in word, different, a spirit. At such times realisation creeps through that she is, in fact, hundreds of years old and wise in the ways of the world - but in the ways of the world that was and now is gone. She is a stranger in a strange land, having awoken from slumber only to find that what she once knew is lost. It infuses her with a sense of loneliness that might not always be the most convincing, but at least appears to be sincere.\\n\\n\r\nViewed as a traveller's tale, their story is one of visiting new places and getting involved with the goings-on there, either by becoming embroiled in the affairs of that locale or by interacting with the local markets and traders in a professional capacity. The different tales, more or less one per locale, depicting the ideological problem of Holo being a wolf-spirit and the fiasco of investing in something the market is flooded with, among others, focusing on the interaction of the two travelling companions in their persons and professions with the wider world, generally lead to a calm pacing that give the two ample space to converse with each other and their surroundings and developing the bond between such unlikely bedfellows.\\n\r\nAs it should be, that bond is slow to develop. Their travelling together at first being nothing but a marriage of convenience, slowly the practical agreement gains an emotional aspect as trust starts to build up. Equally slowly, their conversations change from the purely economical (in all meanings of that word) to the moral and the emotional, yet both keep their distance, befitting two persons who have only known each other for a short time: though banter is exchanged, sometimes infused with quite a bit of wit and mocking of self, once it starts getting personal both have a tendency to back off unless it is truly important for their travels together. If there is no progress in their relationship, this is because there should not be any: Lorenz and Holo are companions, perhaps friends. By knowing each other, they can work together; by caring, they can travel together. But more would be out of place: they are fundamentally different persons in outlook and goals and their focus on the practical side of things only makes them all the more realistic and mature.\\n\\n\r\n-= Spice =-\\n\r\nLooking at Spice and Wolf as the story of its two protagonists, travelling companions and unlikely friends slowly growing into a stronger relationship is, however, missing the trees for the forest. The super-story isn't but a method to link the little tales together. What makes this series one that stands out from the crowd is the staggering amount of detail poured into the fictional world, a world brought to life in many of its facets by the highly unconventional method of making one of the protagonists a merchant.\\n\r\nAs a trader, Lorenz is bound to explore the cities he travels through and while he does so the audience is treated to a setting that is as evocative as it is true to actual history. Though Spice and Wolf is ostensibly set in a fictional world, it becomes clear very soon that this world is the Central Europe of the late 14th, early 15th centuries in all but name. In particular, the cities appear as the market towns of the late Middle Ages, and the trading guilds mentioned are a clear reference to the rising Italian companies and the Hanseatic League. \\n\\n\r\nThe actual content of the show has little to do with the relationship between Holo and Lorenz, but is squarely focused on immersing the audience in the particulars of the small-scale trade of a time when pepper was worth more than gold. It is this what makes Spice and Wolf different from almost anything else out there, and the series makes the most of it, being sure to place enough emphasis on minute details to bring both the practice of the trade and its mentality to life.\\n\r\nThrough Lorenz and his dealings, the audience is shown the workings of the guilds and bourses of that age, including the modus operandi of the early international trading companies and the limited use (and understanding) of trading on credit, as well as the developing sense of difference between nominal and real value of coinage. While watching Lorenz and Holo exchanging banter, the audience is also shown the more mundane aspects of city life, being taken to watch folk festivals, inns and hostels and a variety of stalls and shops.\\n\r\nThe faithful rendition of historical detail of the setting - utensils, architecture, accoutrements all, and even, for once, the ships - surpasses anything I've seen to date in anime, putting your average (and better-than-average) Renaissance fair to shame. From the exact construction of buildings to the fact that trenchers were usually made of bread, it seems as if every single detail of the daily life of people has been carefully checked and incorporated. It does so well that I was honestly miffed when noticing that one letter shown was written in modern, not mediaeval, German.\\n\\n\r\nEqually striking is the general optimism of the general worldview, a sense that people can understand the world and leave their footprint on it. This, too, is an important part of the portrayed setting and true to historical fact. The time was, and is explained to be in the setting, one of technological progress, one wherein more and more tools were developed to aid agriculture and industry and less and less was dependent on chance. Belief systems focus on the human and their mastery of the world, with nothing standing between man and his God but his own mind, resulting in a general outlook of opportunity, contrasting sharply to most fantasy and historical shows and befitting the more grounded story marvellously.\\n\\n\r\n-= And everything nice =- \\n\r\nAnd then, there is myth. Vague, half-forgotten, impossible but in the dark places of the world. Hidden in plain view, in tales from the countryside and quaint mannerisms of people who should know better, shadows of a system of belief of a world past still remain. Only very seldom made explicit, Spice and Wolf employs one of the more subtle and low-key depictions of magic, neatly integrating it into the overall setting. Spirits being real, they only survive where the remaining tales say they ought to be. Reminding the audience every now and then that there is more to the fictional world than market towns, Holo is made less of a unique phenomenon and her desire to return to a home the continued existence of which she can't even be certain of, is thereby enhanced. The supporting cast, as well, complements the setting very well, living wholly in the world of man's endeavours or still faintly recalling what's outside the walls, considering alchemy to be a science yet still a bit fearful of getting involved in it because of its storied connection to the supernatural.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a series with a slow-moving plot and a lot of dialogue, it was a good choice to try and have each conversation be infused with at least an attempt at wit, and it's nice to see how the failing attempts are often recognised as such by the characters themselves. Always remaining on the safe side of the rational-emotional spectrum, the conversations have a lightness and lack of unnecessary outbursts that keeps the overall tone of the series intact.\\n\\n\r\nMention should further be made of the music. Granted, it's about as standard folk fair as it comes, but it fits the setting, accompanying especially the more festive moments perfectly and has the good graces to sometimes simply not be very good. As far as I can tell, there has been made something of an effort to only use traditional folk instruments and what's left of the musical scores of the time (little of which is certain to be actually old, by the way), and some of these instruments just aren't capable of producing the purer sounds their modern varieties can produce. The opening tune's lyrics also do a very good job of introducing and accompanying the type of story told.\\n\\n\r\n-= Icing and Cake =-\\n\r\nLooking at Spice and Wolf as the tale of Holo and Lorenz is mistaking the icing for the cake. What comes first in this show is the spice, that is, the setting. In many ways, the travels of the protagonists are but a means to show the audience a small piece of a living and breathing world. \\n\r\nOriginal, if not unique, in focus and angle, superbly detailed in setting and at least decent in adding a glue to fit the separate stories together, Spice and Wolf was, to me, 2008's biggest surprise and an instant favourite. I'll admit that my particular interest in the era alluded to makes me biased, but even without it the originality of the concept, the integration of actual and made-up legend in a detailed world and the soothing charm of the low-key telling of the tales would have me recommend it as one of the very few shows that shirk away from the incessant need to bombard audiences with action and suspense, romance and relationship or like topics. \\n\r\nCharming, enjoyable by all age groups, calm and beautiful in its manifold details, Spice and Wolf is a delight to sit down by after a long day and simply enjoy.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf is a Supernatural, Romance, Adventure anime set in a sort of fantasy, European, Medieval world. The story itself revolves around a young travelling merchant (Craft Lawrence), who encounters a legendary wolf god, in the appearance of a cute girl (Holo/Horo) and they end up travelling together. However for those expecting plenty of wolf action or full-on romance may be disappointed. Instead it basically follows their journey from town to town, helping each other on complex business deals, whilst coming across major developments and dilemmas. Of course there are pockets of action & minor romantic developments but those don&rsquo;t play much part untillater on in the short series.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the nature of the story; the main characters don&rsquo;t really stay at one place, so the series lacks recurring characters. But the Craft and Holo duo helps make up for the lack of characters, with their thought provoking and witty comments. Craft is a guy who&rsquo;s usually so full of himself that it&rsquo;s hilarious and Holo is the cute, arrogant, wolf-girl that&rsquo;s there to put Craft in his place. The conversations the 2 have are what make the series worth watching however if you turn off that factory in your head called a brain you are bound to miss something important or amusing.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the animation is sheer amazing. The environments are aesthetically well designed that you&rsquo;ll notice straight away it is strongly influenced by Medieval Europe. The characters and objects move somewhat fluidly and have a general slender design but this series doesn&rsquo;t have many opportunities to show what it&rsquo;s fully capable of.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is a mix of piano melodies complemented by a variety of string and wind instruments, to go well with the medieval theme. Though I must say, the music is extremely catchy that you may start humming the OP or ED themes without even knowing it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Spice and Wolf is definitely something to watch if you want to try something a little unique, or if you&rsquo;re just into girls with a pair of cute ears &amp; a tail; because either way you won&rsquo;t be disappointed. The story may not be all that interesting and neither is the very educational economics and trade involved, nonetheless the well developed, main characters are what make it interesting. With such captivating and hilarious, high-brow conversations between the main characters; it is quite easy to forget about the story that doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s going anywhere, half the time. At least the story does nothing to ruin the clever plot but the ending is pretty unsatisfying and in need of a continuation.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "\"Presented a whole new definition for anime. One of a kind story-plot. Intriguing character relationships.\"\r\nTired of action-based (shounen) anime? Want to try something more \"wordy\" for a change? Spice and wolf will be your ideal candidate in this case! Heavily driven by plot, Spice and Wolf require the viewer to pay 100% attention to the dialogues between characters. It is, however, important to note that the conversations between the characters were so well planned that one will hardly ever feel bored over the course of the series.\r\nSkillfully constructed dialogues throughout the series resulted in a wonderful story full of joy and sorrow. While it canbe confusing to follow at first, the story develops itself slowly and quietly for the first few episodes leading to one climax after another in the short 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality is very consistent throughout the series. Smooth transition from scene to scene really makes it hard for even the \"pickiest\" guy (or girl) to complain. HOWEVER the occasional \"nude\" Horo scenes really frustrates me, not because I don't want to see nudity (heck, who wouldn't want to see Horo naked), but rather it is due to the horrible body line curvature/texture (or whatever you want to call it) of Horo's supposedly \"goddess\" body. It would have been better to keep her covered up instead, the animation crew just completely shattered my fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf have some well known CV voicing the main roles. Lawrence's CV is Jun Fukuyama (Lelouch in Code Geass, Kimihiro Watanuki in xxxHOLiC). Horo's CV is Ami Koshimizu (Kallen in Code Geass, Nina in Mai Otome). Norah's CV is Mai Nakahara (Mai in Mai-HiME and Mai Otome, Nagisa in Clannad, Nagisa in Strawberry Panic). Although I am not a fan of Natsumi Kiyoura who sang the OP, I find the OP suit very well with the overall image of the story.\\n\\n\r\nArtfully woven character relationships (though 90% of the time the focus is on Horo and Lawrence) is one of the strong points of Spice and Wolf. In fact, the special bond developed over time between Horo and Lawrence is one of the keys to the success of the show. The bond shared between the protagonists is so unique that it is rarely seen in modern days anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt is worth noting that Ami Koshimizu used a rather catchy accent to make Horo's character stand out (Horo is known to be \"wise\").\\n\\n\r\nAs previously stated, it is heavy with dialogues and will often make you think. Some people may find it enjoyable while others will just drop it instantly. There wasn't much for me to complain about the overall production of the show (beside the nude Horo) and I do completely enjoy the series from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf delivered what it intended to deliver to its viewers very successfully in one season (13 episodes). The ending was not conclusive since, as we found out a while, a sequel is underway. Although not a masterpiece level of work, Spice and Wolf definitely redefined anime in a whole different way.",

            "content": "\"We won't laugh until we get the money, we won't cry until we go bankrupt.\"\r\nIf one wishes to switch a bit from action and cute-girls-doing-cute-stuff series, and watch a more serious but yet funny and romantic story, this is the perfect choice.\r\nThe quote above, said from Lawrence to Holo, represents one of the main features of the anime: the mixture of an economics theme with slice-fo-life elements. From the surface, it sure seems pretty odd, but when you take a deeper look, you see it blend so well with the storyline that long conversations about price raising and market value -boring to many people- endup as things joyful to watch in a way that it's even possible you get excited over commercial deals just as much as you'd be with a mecha fight.\\n\\n\r\nSpice & Wolf is a smart anime, with a serious tone and a lot of dialogue, however, it doesn't lose its silly moments and sometimes shows a glance of an heartwarming comedy.\\n\r\nAlso, I may clarify for those who are still wondering about it, the fanservice in this series is very close to zero, with the exception of few seconds in specific episodes, there is none of if. Then you might ask me \"oh, but that girl was naked in pics and in the first episode as well, wasn't she?\". Well, of course she was. That girl is a wolf and I've never seen a wild wolf wearing clothes before. With that in mind, there was never such intention to turn this series into an ecchi. I would consider it... realistic (in some extension of course).\\n\r\nThere is indeed some eroticism in the series, most of the female characters do have a slender look. It might have been a marketing maneuver, in order to catch more viewers in the beginning of the series, who knows. \\n\r\nAnyway, it is just a nice eye candy, not a huge appeal and definitely not the major focus of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind, the summary here in MAL is very nice. It sums up the beginning of the story, and without further spoilers leave that scent of mystery on the air. \\n\r\nHow lonely would be travel all by yourself? How important it is to have someone with you?\\n\r\nCraft Lawrence is a peddler traveling by himself for more then 5 years. he was able to establish himself as a somewhat-known merchant in the territories of South and is working hard with a goal in mind. After a while, he arrives in a agricultural village during a spice harvest festival, do  some business, meet up with old friends, and... find a wolf-girl. *ahem* Not just an ordinary wolf-girl, please. She is Holo, The Wise Wolf. To the church, a pagan god. For the villagers, the deity of that region spice harvests. What does she wants with him? What will develop from this? Just watching to find it out.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I found wonderful about this story is the placement and the context of it.\\n\r\nThe fantasy element plays an important role in the story, although, it is not the \"generic style\" of fantasy, common in many anime titles nowadays. \\n\r\nInstead of doing an story full of magic, wizards, knights, titans... and things like that, Spice&Wolf approaches the folklore and tales from the medieval era. The struggle between believers in other divinities and the holy church, gods living between people and holiness protecting and blessing the fields are just the tip of the iceberg that will develop along the storyline.\\n\r\nWhat is marvelous to see, is that even with all this development, scriptwriters were cautious enough to not let this characteristics takes the spotlight of the show, which should and indeed continued to be, economics and Holo & Lawrence relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThis series sure has one of the best classic OST I've ever listened to. \\n\r\nWith the sole exception of ARIA -which has a very similar tone then this series by the way- this was probably the first series I actually paused one episode to search what song was playing and if there were any TABs for it.\\n\r\nAlong with a great performance, the sound direction in this anime was also superb. Since I'm already on the topic, I'd take a moment to emphasize the difference some VoiceActors can make in an story. Something that I was amused by was the characteristics and the accent they attributed to some characters speech. The geographic location of them would change their way of speaking and some slang, while Holo for example, talks in a completely different way from other characters. She uses an old dialect from Edo period Tokyo. \\n\r\nIt is great to see that someone did cared about this details. Think about it, indeed  would be weird for a 600+ years old wolf, to talk modern Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf brings up a deep psychological analysis of characters and a lot of development.\\n\r\nDo not expect simple or formulaic characters and never underestimate Holo's personality\u2019s complexity.\\n\r\nThis being a slice-of-life series, of course it would focus on dialogues and characters themselves, however the way these chars interacts with the environment and how the scenario contributes to the normal flow of the story and conversations was also carefully thought. \\n\r\nThe collabo between animators and writers succeeded into this great \"visual interaction\" with characters expressions, allied with a marvelous voice acting already mentioned. One notorious example of it, is Holo's physical reactions to some emotions, where instead of just blushing, she would sometimes raise her ears or move her tail.\\n\r\nThat said, I have no complains with the artwork. In some episodes it was visible that few scenes were rushed, but besides from minor weird camera angles and some lines in the wrong place, there is nothing else to complain.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I'm still enjoying its \"afterglow\".\\n\r\nIt was sure over my expectations. I dislike doing \"generic\" recommendations, but this title is something everyone should watch. But there is a right time for it. If you are new to anime, or if your list contains mostly action/mecha shounen, this is not the right time to watch it. On the other hand, if you're already used to romance or medieval themed dramas this would be a nice pick. Give it a try! Unless you have horror to economics or suffer from fear to math and/or long dialogues, you won't regret it.\\n\r\nI wonder why is this series not very popular... It isn't underrated, as we can see, the score it holds here in MAL isn't that high but still above average. But the ranking of popularity is awful low. Maybe due to the studio who made it isn't that famous? \\n\r\nIt is a jewel in a dunghill after all.\\n\r\nAlong with this, I would recommend for anyone who enjoyed it, to read the Light Novels. Since the anime adaptation of season 2 just cover till chapter 5, it stops right in the middle of the adventure, which is a pain. While we hope for a 3rd season, read the books!",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nAre you tired of action shonen series with a fighting tournament every 2 story arcs? Want to see something different? Anime has many different genres from which to choose: psychological drama, slice of life, echii comedy, sports, etc. How about something REALLY different? An anime centered around trading that mainly teaches the viewer principals of economics like inflation, buying on margin, and short selling stock? Spice and Wolf is a show so uniquely odd that I had a hard time convincing my friends that it actually exists. This is an anime so dialogue heavy and business oriented that it would likely get better ratings onBloomberg than on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. Spice and Wolf also has some well written romance and great characters, so even if you aren't into economics, there is still a chance you will like it.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Spice and Wolf seems simple, but it is very well written and can actually teach the viewer something. It would be an understatement to say that Spice and Wolf is much better at teaching economics principals than Hetalia is at teaching history. For an anime to have such a daringly unique and unconventional story in today's consumer driven media is extraordinary. The setting in medieval Europe reminds me of the famous economic author Ludwig Von Mises and his tendency to use Robinson Crusoe to simplify and better explain complex fiscal theories.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins when a travelling merchant discovers an unusual girl with dog ears and a tail lying naked in the pile of wheat he is transporting. Lawrence is obviously shocked by this, but the mysterious girl Holo claims to be a Goddess that controls the harvest and now wishes to leave this village because the farmers no longer believe in her. Lawrence is skeptical, but Holo offers to prove that she is a wolf goddess by transforming in front of him and causing him to faint from sheer terror. Later that night, Holo appears before Lawrence again and convinces him to take her along with him since she needs to travel with wheat as a harvest deity. This is sort of like Dracula and his need to travel with his coffin and soil of Romania. Holo offers her wise advice she has gained from centuries of living to help Lawrence in the world of trading, and Lawrence in turn will eventually take her back to her birthplace in the far north country of Yoitsu.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters are Kraft Lawrence and the wolf goddess, Holo. Kraft Lawrence is a very believable and realistic protagonist. He is a medieval merchant that at first mostly cares about profit and seems to have a Randian Objectivist outlook. However, as the series goes on we see that he does have a heart and he grows as a character. Lawrence doesn't conform to the stereotypes of anime romance leads. He isn't a pushover that lets a harem of girls beat him up all the time. He isn't a secret pervert that gets nosebleeds at the slightest provocation. He isn't a musclebound hero that rescues random damsels in distress. What he is, is a well rounded character that seems like a real person. Since this is tagged as a Romance title, it is not a spoiler that Lawrence eventually begins to develop some feelings for Holo. However, he is reserved with his feelings and doesn't rush head first into a relationship. Lawrence is calm and calculating as one would expect from a medieval broker. The other character is Holo, who calls herself the \"Wise Wolf\". Holo is centuries old deity that can help crops grow and bring bountiful harvests. However, as mentioned above, she has been abandoned for a new God, which is sort of the Spice and Wolf universe's version of Christianity. This new monotheism denounces the old Gods despite the viewer knowing for a fact that they exist and believes only in 1 God, which the viewer never sees any evidence exists. However, Holo doesn't take revenge because she is not a \"jealous God\" as God Himself said in the Old Testament. Holo is a very bored god that lives in the field of wheat and longs to return to the place she was born. How Gods are born in this series has yet to be explained as of the end of season 2, but it isn't particularly important. The important thing is that she wishes to return to the land of Yoitsu in the far north. Yoitsu is a very vast land with lots of snow, lots of wolves, and few people. If Holo is an accurate representative of the population, the people of Yoitsu seem to have hair trigger tempers and a propensity to get sauced. I honestly wonder why the English dub didn't just give her a Russian accent and be done with it. Holo is in fact quite wise and knows the ways of the world through her centuries of life. However, she can often act immaturely and has a very sharp tongue. It is shown quite often that Holo is very cautious about developing feelings for a mortal, because she knows that she will be alive for centuries after her love has died. Like Lawrence, Holo is a well rounded and believable character that doesn't just fit into an established mold like \"tsundere\" or \"yandere\". A point of criticism from some viewers revolves around Holo's lack of shyness in regards to nudity. The nudity in Spice and Wolf though is very mild and avoids showing nipples or any detailed bits feminine anatomy. It is far more artistic than erotic and realistically displays the attitude that a God would have around mere humans.\\n\\n\r\nSound Track: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFrom the absolutely beautiful opening theme to the sickeningly sweet ending theme, Spice and Wolf has a solid OST. The soundtrack is heavy on flute pieces and seems to fit the environment of an alternate Medieval Europe. My only criticism is that some tracks sound a little too silly like the track \"Kenshi to Yopparai\" which bares a striking resemblance to the famous Torgo theme from \"Manos\".\\n\\n\r\nArt:  5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character drawings are fine, but art isn't really the strong point of this series. The animation is normally OK, but there are scenes that are so poorly animated that it causes unintentional hilarity. Just type: \"Spice and Wolf horse\" into youtube and see what I mean. Those scenes with horrendous animation are few and far between, but they are in fact there and stick out like a sore thumb.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI will say that this is a very dialogue heavy anime. There is little action and that alone may throw off many viewers. Parts of the series can get confusing, so if you can't quite wrap your head around an economic concept or a certain sub-plot, don't be afraid to rewind and watch again. This is especially true if you are watching the subbed version and aren't a very fast reader. Spice and Wolf is not an anime for everyone like Cowboy Bebop or Attack on Titan. It doesn't go for a calculated line drive when it can go all out and swing for the fences. As a result, Spice and Wolf will either be a strikeout or an out of the park home run depending on the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf is the kind of anime that only comes around once in a long while. It is a daring and unique series that everyone should at least try. If you watch the first 6 episodes and absolutely hate it (like most of my friends), that is OK. You don't need to torture yourself and finish the whole thing. However, if you have the desire to keep watching, it is a series that won't disappoint.",

            "content": "I've noticed that the vast majority of the reviews for this series are absolutely glowing, which is the reason I decided to give my input. After having watched it (save for that mysterious 7th DVD-only episode), I thought I'd write a review so that people with my tastes might get a little more perspective on the series. \r\n~Story~\r\nThe story is actually fairly interesting and has a good foundation: a merchant happens upon the incarnation of a wolf God while conducting business in a small town. He promises to escort the wolf home to the north and off they go on medieval merchant inspired adventures. It'soriginal and intriguing, but the execution of the main ideas leaves something to be desired. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the very start, I feel like we the viewers are left with gaps in the overall story. Horo, the wolf, never really explains how exactly she came to be the wheat God for the village in which she and Lawrence, the merchant, meet. It is somewhat implied, but this is never fully explored. Okay. No big deal. The story is still interesting. However, the gaps in info. don't end there. I'd personally like to know why in the world and how in the world she is connected to wheat. She's a wolf, so how did she become so reliant upon wheat? And can that connection ever be broken? Sadly, this is something that is pretty much ignored. The ending of the series is also very open-ended and ambiguous. Now, maybe there's a second season in the works, but it still seemed like a rather random and unsatifactory ending to me. It sort of tied up some overarching themes and concluded the final subarc, but it just felt unfinished to me because it failed to progress the main plot.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I felt was unsatisfactory was how they presented the various economic nuances and dilemmas of the protagonists. It was very difficult for me to figure out what was going on whenever they started talking about debts wrought by miscalculated contracts and the inner workings of bartering businesses. I felt like my confusion could have easily been cleared up had they bothered to add a sentence or two explaining the situation in layman's terms. For example, the movie &quot;The Producers&quot;, which also deals with understanding how an economic risk works, I understood because of the scene in which Bloom explains how their scheme could scam the system. For &quot;Spice and Wolf&quot;, there was no such equivalent explanation scene. They tried to explain things but did it in a fashion that presumes that the viewer already grasps the basic situation. Hece, confusion. \\n\\n\r\n~Art~\\n\\n\r\nAs has been pointed out by the other reviews, the artwork for the series really is high-calibre, especially in relation to the backgrounds and buildings. So, why didn't this section get a 10 out 0f 10 from me? Two reasons: 1. the way they drew noses for straight-on headshots was pretty shoddy at times by using only a bent line to indicate the nose, 2. they often drew Lawrence in such a way that it looked like he had a double chin. Yes, yes, nit-picky, I know, but the double-chin thing in particular really bothered me and they did it consistently throughout the series. I think they were trying to make it look more realistic (your chin does do weird things when you clench your jaw and/or lower your head) but it just came off looking awkward.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of the series was superb both in the sound effects department and openings and endings department. There was one scene in particular which I was impressed by because they included realistic sounds mimicking how someone's bare feet would sound running on stone. The openning theme is slow and methodic, fits the show well, and was so enjoyable that I only skipped it for one episode. The ending theme is cutesy...and weird. But not uncharming. \\n\\n\r\n~Character~\\n\\n\r\nThis is the section in which I deviate most strongly from what the other reviews have said. Horo is a nice enough character, but I found myself usually more annoyed by her than engrossed. There were just a couple of things that she did that really grated on my nerves, and had she been a real acquaintance of mine, I would have smacked her. For example, the scene in which she uses Lawerence's money to buy apples, hits him when he tries to eat one, and when he points out that she bought them with his money so he's entitled, she claims, &quot;I can get money whenever I need it.&quot; I would have kicked any friend who did that to me off the cart. I don't find such behavior endearing or cute, but selfish and bratty. \\n\\n\r\nShe also had the tendecy to always act superior and constantly say &quot;I am Horo the wise!&quot; Aside from scamming a merchant, concocting one plan, and determining the validity of one or two things, she doesn't really do anything &quot;wise.&quot; In fact, when it comes to relationships and helping Lawrence out of tight situations, she's pretty useless. Or at least, that's how it seemd to me. Her arrogance just bugged me. Oh! And as I just stated, she scams this one merchant and that reeeeeaaallly bothered me considering said merchant had done nothing wrong and originally offered Lawrence a really good price for his wares. The merchant takes it in stride, but that doesn't make conning honest business men out of their money any more right. Okay, so it's the game of merchanting to get the most money you can, but that doesn't mean that every merchant should sink to the corrupt system's level. \\n\\n\r\nOther than Horo, my main beef with the characters is that they weren't very dynamic or developed. They're realistic enough but all rather flat and forgettable. \\n\\n\r\n~Miscellaneous~\\n\\n\r\nTwo other things to note: 1. the dialogue at times is somewhat nonsensical and doesn't flow particulatly well, 2. there should have been more Horo in wolf form action. I gotta say that Horo in wolf form was awesome. I liked her in wolf form (for all the things I dislike about her otherwise), and I really wish they'd focused more on that. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's not a bad series, not at all, but it's not fantastic either. It's decent and seems like it's more of a work in progress waiting for some more touching up. Hopefully, people interested in watching it will take the time to read all the reviews and compare their lists with the users who left them to determine whether or not it's for them. Then again, if you've got time to burn anyway, giving it a chance won't be detrimental.",

            "content": "I saw this anime because of a few recommendations online and several glowing reviews, however upon watching Spice and Wolf I have to wonder how old the writers of these reviews are that they can find this enjoyable. If you've read any other review on this show, you'll know it is praised for its \"character depth\" and its use of economics. Let me warn you ahead of time, I have seen puddles with more depth than these characters. They are extremely 2 dimensional, the dialogue might as well have been written by a junior high student, and the monotonous tone of the voice acting isappalling. As to the economics so heavily praised by viewers, it is hardly a fair trade for a good story. When the subject is brought up, it sounds more like the characters are reading from a textbook rather than furthering the story. It basically consists of an economic buzzword being said, followed by the definition, in other words the show is extremely full of parrot expositions.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of the show also leaves something to be desired, as there is little to no music, almost exclusively dialogue and ambient noise, which I understand was the intent, and could be quite powerful if done correctly. Unfortunately, it was not. Instead of using this tactic to emphasize important and deep scenes, the entirety of the show is treated the same and the viewer is quickly desensitized to the effect and no emphasis  is ever placed on anything. When music is actually used, it tends to be poor quality and rather obnoxious, typically played over conversation which was clearly intended to make the conversation seem fun and uplifting but ends up causing the opposite.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of the show is average quality and I really have no comment on it.\\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat, we are greeted by both Lawrence's friend provocatively discussing a business transaction and Holo explaining nonverabally how comfortable she is nude, and how frequently you can expect to see her that way. At this point you would expect that fanservicing will be the downfall of this show but overall what ruined the show for me was the abysmal dialogue and  utter lack of real character depth. As I continued to watch I noticed that the closest thing I could compare this show to, both in character and in dialogue would be Twilight. The obnoxious amount of exposition tropes is also reminiscent of your typical shonen. \\n\\n\r\nI expect the crowd who actually do care for this show are coming from a background in Naruto or One Piece, which were also not my cup of tea. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: If you are below the age of 16 and have never seen anything with a more dynamic story than Naruto, you may enjoy Spice and Wolf, you may even praise it for the greatest characters ever written. But for the adults reading this article who are looking for a show with legitimate character development and an enthralling story, look elsewhere.",

            "content": "Wolves are beautiful creatures to look at. You see them prowling around the woods with their pack and rule the territory that they claim as their own. There is no doubt that they have been the focal point in some anime shows over the years, but when have you seem them being used as an intelligent focal point in a show's narrative? Out comes Spice and Wolf, a tale that follows two of our heroes in their journey involving mercantilism, to convince us once and for all that you can pull off a simple concept and make something brilliant out of it.\r\nSpice and Wolf setsup as your typical traveler's type of story where we follow Kraft Lawrence, a traveling merchant who deals with trading anything that is profitable and makes a fortune out of it. He is then confronted with a Wolf goddess named Holo who wants to come with him in his travels and help him with his business for reasons that involve trying to establish a bond between Kraft and her. What is very fascinating about the relationship between our two main leads is how perfectly paced the bond is between Holo and Kraft. There is no awkward transition between the two automatically becoming lovers over the course of a day or two into the story, or in this case episodes if we're being more formal here. The show takes it's time to build it up slowly so that we can breathe into the scenes that involve them talking to one another and displays them increasing their relationship's strength in a realistic fashion than relying on pointless melodrama. Not there is not any drama between the two but it doesn't come across as being hammy or out-of-place, it fits well with the scene it portrays and succeeds quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nIt also helps to the show's credit that the way Kraft and Holo enhance their relationship isn't just through romantic dialog or dialog that only involve positive responses, they get into arguments, they disagree a lot, and things don't always work out between each others plans. Just like what a real relationship is like for most people. You see this a lot in anime and movies that tackle romance in a formulaic style that doesn't seem very organic or pragmatic from how relationships are really like in a real world setting. Not that portraying relationships in that way is bad, but it's refreshing to see something like Spice and Wolf pull it off and do it in a successful way.\\n\\n\r\nNow let us talk about both characters individually. To my surprise, Kraft turned into a very memorable male lead by the simple fact that they build him up around an archetype that could have easily been bland or generic. I say this because when you deconstruct Kraft as a character, there really isn't that much to go around other than that he's just a simple merchant and nothing else but the way they write him as this strong individualistic character who can handle any given situation with ease comes at a shock considering how Kraft has to one up Holo in terms of character traits. Now Holo, the main star of the show, is one of, if not, the greatest female leads that has ever graced the screen. She's witty, sly, and is an absolute joy to watch when she is front and center. Normally any character like Holo could be looked as a cheap way of shoving in nudity or a generic female character to spice things up, no pun intended. With Spice and Wolf the way it handles Holo's development and personality is very mature and charming in the witty writing that she is given that definitely makes for an interesting character study of how Holo and Kraft come across as very believable characters in how they carry the story forward in a delightful aspect.\\n\\n\r\nThe story's writing, while relying heavily on economic theory, is top-notch and lenient to where it isn't necessarily hard to understand what is going on. Spice and Wolf's economics is grounded upon Medieval lore, where the economy was a little simpler to understand than in today's economic system. What really works well in this demeanor is how it doesn't drag on the narrative too much. How the characters explain their economic motives is not only interesting in an intellectual standpoint but also makes for a strong gripping drama from the way it trickles down to Kraft's eventually economic troubles. Even if you are not a scholar in an economic school, you can still feel the pressure that Kraft and Holo are going through when the eventual climax sets in when they have to find out a way to get out of their debt. How they portray the politics that involve heavily with the church is intellectually honest in how things were running in the era and they portray it with the narrative to good effect on how bribery and trading being done on a daily basis between the economic markets that existed in the past.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically, Spice and Wolf doesn't break any new ground in regards to animation but the backgrounds and the character designs are all done superfluously well. The lush colors in the backgrounds of the mountains and trees, the grimy walls that inhabit the cities and towns they go through, and the darkness that surrounds them really add to the atmosphere that make you feel like you're really looking at a Medieval world. While the animation isn't special, the scenes that involve Holo's wolf transformation were done with good effect in its direction to make it mysterious and dark to let us know that she is a living breathing goddess.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and voice acting do their jobs well although the music itself wasn't anything that stood up as highlights of the show. It features music that fits well to the setting that involves a nice orchestral score that adds to the overall feel of every scene. However the voice acting is exceptionally well done, the main contender for being the best one is Ami Koshimizu. Her sultry remarks with her sly voice for an entertaining listen. That and with Jun Fukuyama's straight man personality make for the great chemistry between the two leads even better in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nAll things considered, Spice and Wolf is a glorious achievement to witness for anyone looking for great storytelling and a great world to experience. It is near perfect with its brilliant character development and astounding use of political themes to meet a well-balanced character story. It's the type that once you finish you want to experience more of its world but not in a negative sense where they do a poor job of expanding it's plot and world to full effect. Spice and Wolf does the exact opposite where you're fulfilled with joy in being shown this contextual landscape to great effect and you hunger for more exploration. The only way to do that for the creators of shows consistent to Spice and Wolf is to look over the show's horizon and embellish the story to new heights with the setting and characters. There's no telling whether it will succeed or fail but it's the effort that definitely counts.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A",

            "content": "It's an anime about economics. And cheating out of economics with a giant wolf.\r\nSTORY - Seriously. It's a show about medieval economics and how the church influenced businesses at the time. The series thus involves a lot of talking heads, and there isn't a whole lot of action, making it a potential turn-off for people who dislike long-winded explanations. Despite this, there is an actual story beyond the educational rambling which, surprisingly, isn't really exposition at all. Spice and Wolf can almost be considered a semi-historical slice-of-life in that it follows the day-to-day activities of a traveling merchant... and his wolf girl companion. It followstheir monetary triumphs and losses and explores the difficulties associated with traveling with a pagan deity when the church is as strong as it is.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely found this to be a very original concept, but even though it's a short series, it took me a while to get into it. The first four or five episodes moved incredibly slow for me and consequently, it took me several months to move past them. Economics is a topic I think schools should cover sooner and in more depth, especially in today's economy, but if you already know your economics, then a lot of the explanations can be irritating and hard to sit through. After the first few lessons though, the story really picks up with drama and tension and serious business and it's easy to finish the second half of the series in one sitting. \\n\\n\r\nInterestingly enough, the relationship between the church and business is really stressed throughout this series, and at times, Spice and Wolf felt very anti-Christianity -- or at least, anti-church. It exposes the power and almost dictatorial authority the church had over the people, their lives, and their businesses. For any religious folk planning on watching the series, I think it's important to keep in mind that this is a historic time period and the corruptions inside the church system were very real -- the series isn't bashing Christianity so much as its giving an accurate critique of history.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - The depth of the characters is always an important aspect of any series, but I think they become even more important in a character-centered and otherwise relatively simple story like this. Lawrence and Horo are really the only characters of consequence here, and honestly, Lawrence is a pretty typical protagonist -- he's a nice, down-to-earth guy, but a shrewd businessman (it's his trade, after all). Horo, however, balances out his normalcy by being generally unpredictable, cheeky, and stubborn. Her antics and mood seem to change suddenly and abruptly at first, but after a while, you get used to it, and you understand why she is the way she is.\\n\\n\r\nHoro's past is not particularly intriguing or original, but the character she is because of it is incredibly interesting in its realism. Horo is definitely a character I can imagine as an actual person; her emotions, reactions to events, and most of all, her relationship with Lawrence reminds me a lot of the dynamics between real people. They way they bickered and they way they looked out for one another was stupidly simple sometimes, but that showed that their creators weren't trying too hard to be something amazing, and that simpleness really worked. ...It's hard to explain, and I'll be the first to say that I wasn't all that impressed with Horo at first, but as the story progressed into that dramatic second half, the depth of her character and her relationship with Lawrence just pulled everything together.\\n\\n\r\nARTSTYLE &amp; ANIMATION - I don't really like the art in Spice and Wolf. It's exceedingly plain for the most part, and I was bothered by Horo's larger-than-need-be eyes in some scenes. Well, duh, it's anime, you say, but... I don't know. I've seen plenty of other big-eyed styles, but this particular one bothered me? Something was off with the proportion of her face (and other female faces) and I didn't like it. It also always, always annoys the hell out of me when an animal is supposed to be a wolf, but they give it a fox tail. Wolves don't have long bushy, white-tipped tails, sorry. I also wasn't impressed by Horo's wolf form, but I've yet to be impressed (artwise) by any anime wolf. That's probably just me, my affinity towards wolves, and my resulting grumpiness though.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was also about average.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - Excellent. Both theme songs are both deliciously fitting for the series, and the end theme in particular is absolutely adorable. The music during the series is also wonderfully appropriate, and it's one of those soundtracks that I'd definitely recommend picking up. \\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING - Also excellent. Jun Fukuyama has a really versatile voice, and despite the fact that I was watching Code Geass R2 concurrently with some of Spice and Wolf, I never really got the impression that Lawrence sounded anything like Lelouch. Like I said though, Lawrence is a pretty typical protagonist and thus had a pretty typical-sounding voice. In those rare moments when his emotions were at an extreme though, Fukuyama really shines through. Ami Koshimizu was a little more recognizable, but it's also not hard to shed previous perceptions of her voice. I really love that these voice actors actually act instead of just providing one typecasted voice that's recycled for similar characters over and over again. I really loved Koshimizu's performance as Horo -- it definitely had a big hand in enhancing the wolf's overall character.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - Spice and Wolf is a unique little series, and if you're patient and up for something a bit different, I'd definitely recommend it. If you're up for some lessons in basic economics, great! The beginning feels a little generic and unimpressive, but it definitely gets better. This is also probably the only series I've seen in recent memory where an add-on, unplanned second season doesn't seem like such a bad idea. The conclusion of the series here is plenty open-ended, but works well enough as an ending if it needs to. Then again, Spice and Wolf was adapted from light novels, and I'm not sure whether this original season touched on the entire story -- regardless though, I'm looking forward to that second season. :3",

            "content": "In one word, spectacular.\r\nSpice and Wolf is a long journey filled with heaps of dialogue and economics, just keep that in mind when deciding to watch it.\r\nStory: Spice and Wolf is set in the medieval in a land that appears to take inspiration from European countries. Our story begins with the introduction of Kraft Lawrence, a travelling merchant who while on his way from town, is approached by the wolf goddess who goes by the name of Holo the Wise Wolf. Who asks to accompany Lawrence on his travels so she can return to her home in the snowy north. From here on out thisis a journey filled with heartwarming and fun filled adventure between the two as they ride together selling goods and getting into trouble. All around a great, interesting and inventive concept.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is partly Spice and Wolf's most charming feature. The interactions that take place between Holo and Lawrence will keep you engaged and smiling throughout the entire series. The quirky and witty conversations that take place at any given chance in this show is the icing on the cake, easily creating a lively and warming atmosphere. Along the journey we will meet a couple of characters who will be introduced and have an important role in certain story arcs. While it could have been done slightly better if was by no means bad and each character was great fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound: while I am a big fan of the opening song for this show it should be said that while the sound is far from anything below average for this excellent show, they are not the strongest aspect of the anime. Never will the sounds be lackluster for this show, with its solid OST filled with nice tracks and great background noises. This anime has good solid sounds which will help immerse you into the world.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Spice and Wolf has a nice and very suitable art style. It has plenty of detail on both the characters individual designs, as well as the background artwork. The style of art chosen for this show reflects well with the time period set, helping to make the show feel more relaxed and alive at the same time. The colour pallet chosen for this show was also nice with a deep lively green and beautiful autumn oranges for the leaves, which absolutely caught my attention.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Throughout the show I was entertained by both the story and the dialogue which helped keep the show alive. It's important to however mention that economic speeches and context are used on a regular basis, while to the large majority of people it is simple and quick to grasp, some may find it can make the show rather stale and boring. That opinion will change per person and is up to you to find your view on it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show was a beautifully executed piece of artwork which will keep you entertained and excited for the whole show. Probably leading you to both watch the second season and then read the light novels and manga.\\n",

            "content": "Personally I did not especially enjoy &ldquo;Spice And Wolf&rdquo; for what it was originally advertised, its dealings and plots involving medieval economics. Those sounded promising but proved to be a bit too difficult for me to fully grasp and really enjoy. Sure, the various aspects of economy, trading and business were interesting and quite unique to see portrayed in an anime series like that, but in the end they did not seem to be able to bring it in such a way that it provided grasping plot material. The fact on most occasions they resorted to standard action events (double-crossings, betrayal, attack by wild wolves,...)to spice up -pun intended- the plot and various business dealings did not really help either.\\n\\n\r\nWhat made &ldquo;Spice And Wolf&rdquo; a real joy to watch for me were the characters, Horo, Lawrence and their relationship, especially their conversations were terrific. \\n\r\nBoth Horo and Lawrence were interesting characters by themselves with the necessary depth to make them more three dimensional. \\n\r\nHoro may be the wolf deity aged over several hundreds of years who proclaims she's known as &ldquo;Horo the Wise&rdquo; and often portrays insight and wit into humans and their many dealings, regardless of that, she is shown to feel lonely, vie for Lawrence's affection and to be jealous when she'd think his eyes would stray. Lawrence on his end may be an experienced merchant, he still has much to learn and even though he seems to be a  kind person that firmly believes in his principles, he does  not shy away to condemn that -or those- which he disapproves of.\\n\\n\r\nThe pairing of the two leading characters and their interaction make for the bulk of interesting scenes and plot the series has to offer, next to Horo being an enticing leading character, they end up carrying the entire series.\\n\r\nHoro and Lawrence's budding relationship is especially interesting and deserves further development as their love has unique implications since Horo does not only age differently, she simply isn't human, her human appearance is merely a disguise. Seeing them both attracted and attached to each other regardless of those facts is not only romantic but interesting to see. (Similar plots arose in series such as &ldquo;Chobits&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ghost In The Shell: Stand-Alone Complex&rdquo;, although it involved androids and humans in those series.)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was good and consistent throughout the series, it did not especially excel but never dropped either. Backgrounds were nearly always lush paintings which aided to give the series its medieval atmosphere. \\n\r\nCharacters such as Horo and Lawrence received a lot of attention and Horo was always well animated which helps in showing the different facets of her character. The first episode may give off a wrong impression since Horo is drawn 'naked' throughout most of it but her nudity is never really used as a fanservice medium but oft as a plot device to show that with her being a wolf and not a human being, she deals differently with her human appearance. The absence of clothes for her is not an absence of defence or a means to gain advantage through the sensuality of the naked human form.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack supported the scenes well and was able to convey a medieval touch with its abundant use of violins. I personally didn't care much for the ED song though, it sounded a bit too odd.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for an interesting series that deals with serious economic principles, I'm not sure &ldquo;Spice And Wolf&rdquo; will really bring you what you seek. Instead, I'd recommend it more if you want to see a nice character pair interaction that thrives on its dialogues and developing bond.\\n\r\nAnd if you like cute wolf girls, you can't afford to miss this series!",

            "content": "At first I was baffled what kind of anime is S&W and would it leave an impression on me when I watched it. Happily enough, it did and with a fresh genre that it introduced for today's generation.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nMaking a breakthrough using \"economy\" and \"trade\" as the main theme, it is a fresh approach that was injected to the mostly underrated medieval theme anime series without the fancy mahou or sword-and-damsels-in-distress approach. The story would be slow at first but will pick-up for most 1st time watchers.\r\nArt: 9/10\r\nIMAGIN studio did a great work in making this series to suit a medieval atmosphere for the viewer.The graphic and art is very good with the golden fields of wheat to the dark forests of the countryside that makes one to be fully absorbed into it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nAs I expected, orchestral music was used to simulate the theme for the anime and it was very good although it was a bit tedious that they would re-use them most of the time as the series progresses. The OP and ED theme fitted the theme and gives you a mellow and warm feeling.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nHORO~! Well, who could love or hate her? Lawrence too and some of the other characters in the series. Although character development was not much of a factor, their expressions and attitude are enough to entice us to either love OR hate them in a way. ^__^\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI rarely enjoy a SHORT anime series such as S&amp;W but it did for me. Most of the feeling comes from Lawrence and Horo arguing to each other and of course the trades of being a merchant. What lacks maybe is more romanticism since medieval themed ones like this is all about romance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nA great series BUT TOO DAMN SHORT, Spice and Wolf is definitely a very good series to watch not because of its exquisite art or marketing, but how the author was able to create a fresh genre of &quot;economic anime&quot; that would surprise even for me who watches them for a long time.",

            "content": "Usually, when one thinks of fantasy, sword-wielding heroes and epic battles are the first things that come to mind. Indeed, these are the norm for the genre. While there are some great stories that fit into this description, such as Lord of the Rings, or Berserk (to name an anime), the genre can feel quite stale. In this sea of monotonous tales, Spice and Wolf provides a refreshingly different take on the genre. It is a charming, laid-back tale that treads in territory scarcely explored in fantasy: Economics.\r\nKraft Lawrence is a traveling peddler. Traveling from place to place in order to make a profit, heleads a rather lonely life. That is, until he finds he has picked up a hitchhiker. A girl, with the ears and tail of a wolf. She claims to be Holo, the harvest god of a near by town, and requests to travel with Lawrence until they reach her homeland in the north. Though hesitant at first, Lawrence decides they could travel together, as he figures that traveling with a deity could benefit him. However, his new companion may be more trouble than he expected. \\n\\n\r\nThough the concept of a fantasy revolving around economics seems disastrous, Spice and Wolf pulls it off amazingly well. Despite being 90% dialogue, this anime is always involving and never dull. It creates a rich medieval world full of interesting  and likable individuals, and turns the seemingly boring topic of economics into something truly fascinating. This is due, in no small part, to the fantastic characterizations and chemistry of the leads.\\n\\n\r\nHolo is one of the most endearing female leads in recent memory. She can often be fickle, flirtatious, jealous, vindictive, and a real tease; throughout it all she is always charming and a joy to behold. However, she also has a more sensitive side, and a strong desire to not be alone. This is usually masked by her self-assured demeanor, but it gives her character genuine depth, and her moments of vulnerability are some the the show's best. Though he does not quite have the star power of Holo, Lawrence has perfect chemistry with his companion. His market-savvy outlook balances Holo's more primal outlook incredibly well; plus he can match her in wit. On top of that, there is Holo constantly teasing him and sending mixed messages. The result of this chemistry enthralling. Most of the time in any given episode is dedicated to Holo and Lawrence in extensive conversation, but it never becomes tedious to watch. It's just as fun to watch Holo tease Lawrence as it is to see her fight off a gang of thugs in wolf form. The rest of the cast fall firmly into supporting roles, none can hope to steal the spotlight from the leads. This is not to say they are bland or boring, quite the contrary. It is that they are all just people who Holo and Lawrence come across, and as such it is hard to really attach to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe theme of economics is used very well, and is the driving factor in the show. Most of the conflict does not come from Holo's identity of a wolf deity, but from Lawrence's business dealings. This is good because it makes the whole idea of economics part of the plot, instead of just some gimmick to distinguish itself from other anime fantasy. The flip side to this is that the story arcs can be quite predictable: Lawrence makes a business dealing, it turns out to be more than it seems, he and Holo work together to solve the predicament; occasionally Holo uses her wolf form. That's about the extent of what happens in a story arc. This is likely due to the plot's laid-back nature, it is simply about Lawrence and Holo traveling to Holo's homeland in the north and the business dealings they have along the way. Make no mistake, there are some deeper themes about Lawrence and Holo's mutual loneliness, and the difference in their live spans (Holo already being a few hundred years old), but these are merely brought up rather than dealt with. This laid-back approach may be a bit off-putting to those looking for a more gripping plot, but there is just so much to enjoy that it hardly matters.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side, Spice and Wolf is superb. The both the character designs and backgrounds are appropriate to the show's setting. The lively cities, small towns, and vast undeveloped land illustrated create a convincing Middle-age European style world. Not a single character looks out of place in this world, their designs reflect the setting of the story as well as their social status. From modest town folk to regal lords, each character is designed accordingly. Then, of course, there is Holo's character design; never before have ears and a tail looked so good on a character. It is not just that her character design is attractive (and it certainly is attractive), it is the unique way her personality is expressed. Whether Holo is being a flirt or having a more vulnerable moment, her mood at any given moment can be seen clearly through her ears and tail. It is a brilliant use of body language, and a surprisingly seldom used one (considering how many anime characters are running around with animal ears and tails). The music also fits the setting incredibly well, sounding like something that would be played during the era. It is usually light-spirited, pleasantly supporting the long stretches of dialogue between characters. However, when called to do so, the music can tenses up to build excitement in the more dramatic moments; it can also be heartrending during the more tender moments.\\n\\n\r\nThough seeming a bit to laid-back at times, Spice and Wolf is a fascinating take on a genre that is dominated by trite sword-wielding adventures. It has one of the strongest couple of leads in recent memory, and the world they explore is well detailed and wholly believable. For those looking for something out of the norm for the fantasy genre, this is one show not to be missed.",

            "content": "The driving force behind any action we take can be attributed to the profit as a result of said action. Whether that profit is tangible or intangible, our lives are loosely based on a \"avoid punishments and collect rewards\" mentality. Yet, it is strange. We sacrifice our health in order to acquire wealth only to spend that surplus to recuperate our well being. In that sense, it is seemingly irrational for us to work without pause in with the hope that our efforts will be handsomely rewarded.\r\nHowever, people continue to do so, sweating tears and blood in the process. Ookami to Koushinryou, also known asSpice and Wolf, explores this theme with a supernatural, medival, and romantical flair. Through the utilization of cleverly written dialogues and exchanges, a memorable cast of characters, and intriguing arcs, Spice and Wolf presents fundamental financial concepts and human relationships in a witty and interesting way.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the show is built upon the relationship formed by chance between Kraft Lawrence, a traveling merchant, and Horo, a wolf deity who oversees the harvest. Under the agreement that Lawrence guides Horo to her homeland in the north, the two begin to travel together, creating fond memories, facing hardships, and of course, conducting business together.\\n\\n\r\nMany consider money and love as the two primary forces behind the demeanor of any person; the tangible and intangible reasons, if you will. It is unusual for these two forces to work together resulting in a ideal life for any person, and this is what Spice and Wolf primarily focuses on. Casting aside the aspects of the show that are based in fantasy, the conflict between the two is a very real struggle that Spice and Wolf explores. The relationship between Lawrence and Horo is far from ideal: it is tested in many ways, by adversaries that take many forms, and exhibits the fundamental concept of risk versus reward. It has been said that there can be only one great love in your life. The question is, is it the prospect of great fortune and the happiness that comes with it, or the fortune of a person that cannot be bought at any price? Spice and Wolf presents both sides of that coin.\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf's strength lies in the personality of the characters and the discussions about life, love, and profit between them. The merchants who act based on logical thinking and appraisal of facts; Spice and Wolf takes us into their world and shows us how a bit of cleverness and wit can go very far, and how any lack of information or foresight can cost someone more then they could ever imagine. \\n\\n\r\nLawrence and Horo make for an interesting combination to watch. On one hand, you have your wily traveling merchant who is a respectable man in his field and gets by making profit through calculations and predictions, and on the other, we have a wise wolf who has seen many a years pass and many a person met who is an expert at manipulating emotions and expectations. This duo, as expected, are able to use their talents to make a greater profit than your run of the mill peddler. However, as intelligent and cunning as they are, they are not perfect, and run into their fair share of troubles, and makes it that more interesting to watch. There is a lot to be said about a romantical relationship between a man and a deity; however their relationship does not follow the natural paradigm of such a situation. It is surprisingly ordinary, as each try to deal with their feelings for the other, and how they express their affections and emotions concerning the other. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is tastefully done and with accordance to the time period. From the well drawn towns that the two visit, to the scenery in the background while they are traveling; everything serves to enhance the atmosphere of a true adventure and the concept of traveling freely. The music is appropriate; ranging from lively violin pieces to somber folk songs, the tune more often than not fits the mood very nicely. Whether it's a relaxing scene in a pub where Horo and Lawrence are sharing a drink in high spirits, or it's a high tension situation between merchants, the music accompanies the scene appropriately.\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf weaves a tale of finance with hints of fantasy and romance in a endearing and intelligent way. For those who like a show to be stimulating, witty, and emotional, Spice and Wolf is an excellent choice.\\n",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf is a peaceful journey through a stylized, medieval Europe.  The story follows Lawerence Craft, a successful merchant, as he travels a winding path North to take his companion, the wolf-god, Holo, back to the home she has nearly forgotten.\r\nArt \u2013 7\r\nArtistically, Spice and Wolf succeeds in its panoramic intake of the various environments Lawerence and Holo travel throughout the series.  The show is very drenched in the authenticity of its time, from the rickety wagons to the stone inns.  The colors are mute wheats, somber blues, cloudy grays, and lots of brown, a palette that sets the show apartfrom most other series.  With that in mind however, the show becomes a bit of a bore when the focus is not on new sights, but on the bland character design, or even once the town of the moment has worn its welcome.  None of this is helped by the very stagnant sense of animation that contributes to a bit of Spice and Wolf\u2019s mustiness.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 8\\n\r\nAs with much of the natural, and researched feel of the art, a lot of the music helps contribute to the realism of the time period.  A score of wonderful strings and woodwinds greatly contribute to filling in the emotional backdrop of Spice and Wolf.  Music aside, the aural focus of the show is clearly in the performances of stars, Jun Fukuyama, and Ami Koshimizu.  In an almost traditional male/female comedy pairing, the two perform their roles with more charisma, wit, and depth in one episode than most casts manage to accumulate over a whole series.  For all intents and purpose they are the shining focus of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 8\\n\r\nSo, of course, because of the skilled performances of Fukuyama and Koshimizu, Lawerence Craft and Holo are brilliantly characterized solely because of the nature of their interactions.  With very little to go off of from the script\u2014Lawerence is a crafty merchant with lofty goals while being a bit inexperienced in meaningful human interactions; Holo, a wizened and free spirited wolf-god, has lived so long she can\u2019t manage to remember her roots\u2014the two are fully realized because of their relationship with one another.  This is enhanced by the clever and flirtatious dialogue use to dance circles around each other, the hallmark of Spice and Wolf.  That aside, every other character introduced seems wooden and unnecessary compared to the partnership of the leads. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 6\\n\r\nPerhaps the main weakness of the show is that the story is an uninspired adventure that is ultimately very forgettable.  Craft and Holo travel from town to town and encounter some sort of problem that, with high school level economics, they must scheme their way out of messes.   Insert a twist and a mysterious young girl for the sake of strengthening Holo and Lawerence\u2019s relationship, and you have the jist of the plot.  That said, I think the show was successful once in combining those elements to create an entertaining amount of tension. Beyond that, as a viewer, I tended to yearn more for the fantastic dialogue and a stronger sense of development in Holo and Lawerence\u2019s relationship than what was witnessed onscreen. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 7\\n\r\nThough the on-screen team of Lawerence and Holo is one of the best relationships this side of Banner of the Stars, it wasn\u2019t enough to carry a lot of the staleness of the overall production.  In conjunction with a heartily disappointing ending, the viewer is left either totally mystified by the luminous performance of Fukuyama and Koshimizu, or with a slightly bitter, \u201cThat was all?\u201d taste in their mouth.  My feelings are of the latter.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\\n",

            "content": "When watching this show I ponder on what it really means to \u201cFalling into the Hype\u201d.\r\nIt is na\u00efve to think that when a show is popular that it doesn\u2019t effect your mood going in. \r\nBut on that same thought is there a difference in \u201cFalling into the Hype\u201d and just seeking understatement on why something is popular. \r\nI didn\u2019t come into this show hyped but throughout this experience I was always search for that special something. \r\nSomething I never found. All I was left was this indifferent feeling. \r\nWhen you are stuck in an indifferent feeling is a good indication that the show is average.\r\nItis tasked upon you at that point to go through all the aspects of the show and see what would you say is above average and if that is enough to warrant putting up the score. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I asked about this show before I started watching my comrades noted there was a lot of mentioning of economics.\\n\r\nThat is definitely something that caught my attention and was the most enjoyable plot about the show.\\n\r\nI actually wrote a paper in college all about merchant guilds and having an anime that covered it was satisfying but only to a certain extent. \\n\r\nWe saw glimpses of the trade warfare going on but it wasn\u2019t a full-fledged dive into the economic wars of the world. \\n\r\nI would personally like to see a show about merchant guilds that would operate more like 91 Days. \\n\r\nThere was no individuality given to any of the guilds. \\n\\n\r\nThe merchant guilds were primarily there to only put hardships on our main character Lawrence. \\n\r\nA character that I have to say am disappointed in as he was fairly bland the entire entry. \\n\r\nThere were glimpses at the end that showed he could improve in the second season. But he needs to drop the White Knight act. \\n\r\nThen even as a businessman I can\u2019t respect him as I don\u2019t know who in their right mind would put all their money in one basket instead of building up a contingency. \\n\r\nThere is no time in this show where I can definitively say I felt bad for him.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Holo calls this guy a loser. She isn\u2019t wrong.\\n\r\nHolo is the best character of the show by default but still isn\u2019t exactly my type of girl.\\n\r\nI have seen a lot of individuals deeming Lawrence and Holo to be one of the best couples in all of anime.\\n\r\nYet the romance in this season has barely even been scratched. I would hope in the second season there would be much improvement. \\n\r\nBut as for the first season we\u2019ve only seen Tsundere flirting. That is nowhere near enough for me. \\n\\n\r\nThen we move on the supernatural element of the show. \\n\r\nI really liked the opening the show and the world it was attempting to create in episode 1 about Holo\u2019s origins.\\n\r\nBut all of that was downgraded to a side story and an unfulfilling one at that. \\n\r\nThere was all this talk about the people believing they didn\u2019t need Holo anymore to bless their crops.\\n\r\nBut because of everything else going on in the show the climax to that just fell flat. \\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t even put that into the importance of the currency wars that was noted throughout the season. \\n\r\nHaving rivaling currencies was very intriguing aspect to follow.\\n\r\nBut when the economics changed over to just being there for hardships on Lawrence we lost that flare there as well. \\n\\n\r\nWhat it comes down to is can I say that anything about this show was fulfilling? The answer would be no. \\n\r\nThe OP and ED are good but nothing I would put in my top 20. \\n\r\nThe Art is good but nothing I\u2019d rave about. \\n\r\nI\u2019m giving those 8 out of 10 but there is nothing amazing there for me to want to bump up the score. \\n\r\nI will also note that I felt the pacing was rushed for the plot. There was also time for more plot that was taken up by slice of life episodes. \\n\r\nFinally I do find it ironic that even in the moment of writing this review. My feeling on this review of the show reflects my opinions on show. Indifferent. \\n",

            "content": "Ookami To Koushinryou, also known as Spice And Wolf. Medieval culture, medieval economy, medieval legends, and a wolf, this is what Spice And Wolf is all about. An immortal wolf. An adorable, funny, sad, Wise wolf who loves apples and who loves to tease her companion. You will hardly forget of such wolf, and the more you'll know about her, the more you'll want to know about her.\r\nStory: 9\r\nI rated the story of this series 9 but... There is actually no story. The plot is about a medieval merchant, Craft Lawrence, who one night stumbles upon Holo The Wise Wolf. She seems to be anormal girl, despite having a \"Wonderful Tail\" and wolf years on her head, but she's actually a kind of goddess. Her will is to return to her homeland, to the north, and Lawrence is supposed to fulfill her wish. That's it, as far as the plot only is concerned.\\n\r\nWhat happens in the episodes then, you ask? In each and every episode we'll have Lawrence simply making his job. He's a travelling merchant, so he travels from town to town trying to make convenient deals and make profit. Be prepared to see a lot of PURE medieval economics. \\n\r\nSo the \"Story\" if you want to call it like that, is divided in two big parts: the first one is the economics one, in which we simply follow Lawrence's deals; the second one is the relationship between the two protagonists, and that's the main event of the whole anime. But I will get to that later.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI'm not a huge expert as far as Art is concerned, but I can say that I liked pretty much everything in the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe opening, Tabi No Tochuu, is by far the best one I've ever heard so far. The 1 minute and 20 seconds edit we hear in the show gives even more pathos than the original song, in my opinion, because such beginning with a soft piano and the beautiful voice of the then 18-year-old Kiyoura Natsumi is magical, mysterious and extraordinarily fitting with the atmosphere of the anime. I was literally chilled the first time I heard it and for the first time I was actually sad that an anime opening ended so fast. The ending is just funny.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the anime itself is very very nice and it perfectly fits with the medieval setting of the show. There are no particular tracks to quote, but all of them are good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nHere we go. This is the real reason why Spice And Wolf should be a MUST. As I said before, one whole half of the story focuses on the relationship of the two main characters Lawrence and Holo. \\n\r\nLawrence is just a merchant. He's not any kind of \"The Best Merchant Of The Lands!\" or \"A merchant of incomparable ability!\" or some other epic guy who's gonna take over the world with his trades. No. He's a simple travelling merchant who simply does his job and lives like that. His job requires ability and luck as well. So if he's not good enough or lucky enough, he's gonna pay for that, and you WILL actually see him in desperate conditions, during the show.\\n\r\nHe's an open person, who enjoys talking, exchanging information, he's quite the solar guy. He's just a little slow with women, which makes his relationship with Holo way more awkward than it should be, sometimes, and quite funny other times. His best quality, though, is his generosity. He doesn't turn down Holo's request of taking her back to the north, and he's even ready to put aside his own future goals for her sake. \\n\\n\r\nBut the shining gem of this show is Holo. She is, so far, the best character I've ever seen in anime, and with no doubts my favorite one. What about her? \\n\r\nAs I said, she's some sort of Wolf-Goddess, but she introduces herself as \"Just Holo, nothing more, nothing less\". During the show we will see almost every kind of her personality. We will happen to see a teasing Holo, a drunk Holo, an apple-loving Holo, a funny Holo, an angry Holo or even a heartbreaking sad Holo. We will be surprised of how much human a WOLF-GODDESS is. We will notice how her immortality is an actual burden to her, and how sometimes she genuinely wishes to be mortal. The depth of this character will catch you in every possible way and as I said in the very beginning: the more you'll know about Holo, the more you'll WANT to know about her. There can be no filler episodes in Spice And Wolf, because whatever we know more about Holo, that's like gold to us.\\n\r\nI'll just make an example and share my own thought about Holo. There is a saying, that \"People die only when they are forgotten\". Holo is immortal, so in other words, she can't die. On the other hand, all the people she's met in her life were all mortals, and soon or later, they all died. But since Holo is alive and has memories of all of them, they still \"aren't dead\", as we refer to that saying... But is Holo really alive, having nobody to remember HER? The beautiful, cruel and very delicate contrast in this is that Holo, in some ways, isn't actually immortal, but she grants immortality to everyone she meets. She's really alive only for small periods of her life, and Spice And Wolf is set during one of them, while she's making room in Lawrence's memories.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThis rating is an average of two other ratings, one for each half of the show. I rated 8 all the economics parts, since even though I didn't really understand everything, it was quite interesting to see how things worked back then, what is actually a travelling merchant and so on. I won't give more than 8 because I have to say it, in certain moments I really got bored and was tempted to skip parts of the episodes, which I fortunately didn't.\\n\r\nThe other half, the relationship between the two protagonists, gets a 10/10 hands down. It's natural, you actually feel like you're with them, their third companion, and you are actually able to share their thoughts and feelings. I really loved to see how the two behaved during difficult or critical situations, as well as their psychological development. You'll always want to see more from them, even about their most stupid or less important aspects, such as drunk Holo.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThe show itself is awesome, and I really really loved it. It isn't a full 10/10 simply because of the whole economics half which is great, but if someone isn't specifically into it, it's hard to follow and it might lower the expectations of the show. So you should better avoid it if you aren't ready for a lot of talking about hard stuff. But if you love well-made romance, with really awesome characters, then I'm sure that all of the economics won't be a huge burden to bear.",

            "content": "Wolf and spice can be summed up fairly easily. Be prepared for ALOT of dialog. In essence, its about a story about merchant trading during medieval times. A time when the word of the catholic church was more important than anything else and anyone else was deemed a witch or heretic. Since it is set in such archaic times it would be a perfect fit to have an anime about merchant trading.\r\nEver since i was in middle school I used to play video games with trading and how prices rise and fall from location to location and how supply and demand and even risk marginsfor investing in certain things to turn a profit. That was the main goal, to make money. And that is the main goal of our main character Lawrence Kraft. Through his travels he entrusted a small heretic town that believed in a wolf god named Horo that watched over their crops. And it just happens that Lawrence Kraft befriends this god and he soon finds out that she just wants to go home. And so the adventure begins....\\n\\n\r\nBeing a story about trading goods there is bound to be alot of dialog between bartering, negotiating, trading information and the chemistry between Horo and Lawrence. If theres going to be alot of dialog an my anime it better at least intelligent and make sense. Luckily this show does it very well, almost perfect. And its safe to say this is because how Horo and Lawrence feed off each others energies so well that you almost feel like you're right there arguing with Horo. Theres no &quot;voice in the head&quot; in this anime, all their thoughts and ideas go between each other and nothing is never left out. Although little background details are left out for time constraints, viewers with an open mind can understand most of the unmentioned side stories. Those who cant figure out the small things, the subbers (ayako) were nice to place side notes for every episode. Its very refreshing to see an anime that actually takes time to explain things to the point that you are convinced enough to believe the situation at hand. \\n\\n\r\nLawrence and Horo are the only main characters of the show so having a good chemistry between them was key but also having a strong seiyu cast for those two is another reason why this show is addicting. Their voices emit their emotions perfectly and the background music just makes this show so much more elegant and beautiful. Its basically consists of a string quartet. Who ever composed all of the background music must be one of the best composers I've ever heard. I never knew so many emotions can come out of just a group of strings. Environmental sound effects are just as what you would expect after hearing the beautiful strings and artwork. Crickets chirp at night, flames flicker and click, they're all of high quality. But they never interfere with the dialog at all which I enjoy the most. \\n\\n\r\nThe last component that brings this whole show to masterpiece status is the artwork. This show is best shown on HD resolution definitely. You can see all the painstaking detail it took for all the artists to draw all the settings of the medieval towns, each cobble stone looks different from each other, the stained glass is painted with perfect care. Even all the guild halls and churches have a massive feel to them. Everything about the artwork screams perfection and is easily one of the best artwork I've laid my eyes on. The character animations aren't as greatly skilled as  the background and static animations but it does hold a medium-high quality at best. But Horo and Lawrence are still quite memorable throughout the whole show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this show crams so much information and dialog to the viewers its easy to say that its not for everyone. But this is indeed a very intelligent, beautiful, and intriguing show. Its a show that you will either understand or not. As for me I love shows like this that leaves JUST enough out for the viewer to make them think and analyze about the episode they just saw. And I am a total sucker for beautiful artwork and music, but character chemistry is what drives me (and all my other 10's on my list) to score this a 10.\\n\\n\r\n...mind you this show still isn't for everyone. \\n\\n",

            "content": "This is a review of BOTH seasons of Spice and Wolf, but I have gone to great lengths to make it completely spoiler-free.\r\nPersonally, I believe Spice and Wolf's central theme to be a rephrasing of the saying 'Never judge the content by the cover'. The story is one of the most unique in anime, despite the presence of a naked wolf girl that would normally slap a bold 'FANSERVICE' stamp right across the middle. Spice and Wolf is inexplicable, to be honest. It's a medieval fantasy, but has nothing to do with swords and spellcraft, but rather trading and economics. If I try to explainthis in any further detail, I will risk adulterating the amazing experience that is the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, having watched the anime first, the light novels don't cut it (well-written as they are). Spice and Wolf isn't just beautiful in context to the (basic scaffolding of) a story, the world, the atmosphere, the narrative, or what I believe to be the greatest female lead of all time. It's one of the most visually and aurally appealing stories out there. Only three or four shows have made it into my top ten before I even completed the series, and this is one of them.\\n\\n\r\nAs has now become customary, I will proceed to rate the show on the subject of story, characters, its visual aspect, its aural aspect, and its overall entertainment value, plus any bonuses or deductions it might earn along the way.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Spice and Wolf is not exactly a story. It earns points for setting everything just right, but gives the story the freedom to be divided into arcs; most of which are thoroughly enjoyable, and the origin stories to provide background are well-written, but still enough to shroud the subjects in mystery, which I personally tend to favor. However, at times, the show becomes unnecessarily complicated, resulting in convoluted storylines revolving around arbitrary trading escapades, which might bore viewers who aren't fascinated by the subject of economics (and I am yet to find those who are). However, this is but a tiny imperfection in a masterwork.\\n\r\nI hereby award the story with an 8 out of a possible 10. However, a more realistic portrayal medieval world is something I greatly value, as seen on George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire, and that gives it a one point bonus to result in a final rating of a 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are some of the best I've ever encountered. Holo is probably one of the greatest characters of all time, and undoubtedly my favourite female lead in all fiction. Lawrence is also a brilliant character, with quirks and eccentricities and a keen intellect, but not without flaws. It only makes it better that his English voice is the same as that of Okabe Rintarou from Steins;Gate, my favourite male lead, who also happens to share a slew of character traits with Lawrence. I hate to say this, but some characters come across as lazy and one is a little too Moe-influenced for my liking. If not for the sheer brilliance of the lead characters' performance, I would deduct an entire point for the few bad characters there are. However, I cannot find it in myself to do so.\\n\r\nI award the characters of this show with a 9.5 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals of Spice and Wolf aren't overly extravagant, but are beautiful, and manage to capture the setting of a medieval world (without an emphasis on huge gilded swords and dragons) perfectly. The visuals in the second season, due to the change in the animation studio, are a tad more outlandish, but still carry much of the same flair.\\n\r\nThe visuals of Spice and Wolf earn a 9.5 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nNow, moving on to the aural aspect.\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf's music is beautiful, it's opening is one of my favorites to date, and the lengths the studio went to in order to incorporate medieval instrumentation into the soundtrack really paid off. Tracks like the initial score to the festival in Pasloe or the more fast paced Zawazawa Suru, or even the tracks that add to the suspense of the show when it's required really hit home.\\n\r\nI award the aural aspect Spice and Wolf an 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nI would be remiss if I did not, at this point, mention the show's opening sequences, both of which are rather spectacular and definitely are a credit to the show's sound and animation departments. On that note-\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of bonuses, there is one thing that Spice and Wolf has that earns it an enormous sack of brownie points; the dub. Aye, Spice and Wolf boasts what is, in my opinion, one of the greatest dubs of all time, and is comparable to the likes of Cowboy Bebop and Steins;Gate. The Japanese voice simply cannot do justice to the character of Holo herself, much less Brina Palencia's impeccable portrayal of her. J. Michael Tatum as Lawrence is, as I might have mentioned, a perfect match. The dub and openings are so utterly spectacular that I award not one bonus point, but two, resulting in a final rating of the aural aspect; 11 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the show's entertainment value;\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf is my favourite show for a reason; the characters. No matter how convoluted and frustratingly intertwined the stories get, you can always divert your attention to the main characters and their interactions, which is what the show really is about. Although it goes without saying that the story will have its impact on everything, and at times is good enough to turn your head in its direction, and then weaving itself in with the MASTERFUL character development to create something truly amazing. I hereby award the entertainment aspect of Spice and Wolf with a 9 out of a possible 10. However, it gets a one-point deduction; letting it drop at the end of the second season with a half-baked finale (whereas the ending of the first season was conclusive enough to serve as a true finale) seals its fate in stone as naught but promotional material for the light novels, however good as it may be. Hence, the aspect of entertainment gets an 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't fine-tuned these ratings as much as I normally would, but I didn't want to analyse the show at such a critical level as to end up sullying the experience for a prospective audience.\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf earns an overall rating of 9.4/10, and a personal recommendation that comes with my three favourite anime series' of all times; right alongside Steins;Gate and Cowboy Bebop.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I would like to say that if by any chance a third season were to be announced, the rating would instantly increase to a perfect 10. However, if it does what the second season did, I the overall rating of the franchise might drop down a notch to a 9.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this was a satisfactory overview.",

            "content": "A show about a merchant and an incarnation of a harvest-wolf-god, set in a beautiful medieval world.\r\nSo, a merchant named Lawrence encounters the incarnation of the harvesting god - a wolf god at that. Her incarnation looks like a human except wolf ears and the tail to match. Then, he's supposed to accompany her to her home country in the north. On top of that, it's all set in a medieval setting. That's pretty interesting, if you ask me. It lays the base for a good adventure anime; which I definitely like.\r\nThis show doesn't have a vast array of main characters - it's mainly Lawrenceand Horo (the wolf-god) so far. Well, they're both good characters, and I especially like how Horo is a contrast in herself: She is pretty smart, and wise - as she says herself several times - at times. Still, she can be pretty child-like, and has a personality that doesn't really indicate wisdom or smartness.\\n\\n\r\nLawrence is, well, a pretty average main character, I think. I don't really have much to say about him. There's one thing I don't like, however: They both try to act though towards each other, hiding their feelings. Or something like that. Anyway, I am pretty tired of seeing that, even though it's turning into a standard part in a recipe for this kind of anime.\\n\\n\r\nAh, and I really like the setting of the show, as I mentioned earlier: A medieval world. I find it really awesome to watch this show with its medieval feel - I've always been a sucker for that.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this can turn into a pretty good show. I'm going to recommend this to all of you adventure anime fans out there. However, it can be pretty confusing in the first episodes - I'm just starting to understand it after thinking a bit about it. But that may just be me, so watch it yourselves!\\n\\n\r\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)",

            "content": "A sensory description accompanied by fields of gold swaying as the west wind moves. A reference to a European legend so obscure most people living where the legend was current will have never heard of it, and well-used to boot. A depiction of change, of progress and of its accompanying alteration of people's perception. All in a preamble spoken in a soft voice.\r\nHow could this not turn out to be brilliant?\r\nWhen discussing Spice and Wolf, the very title of the series is of interest. More particularly, the sequence of the words of that title. Whereas the Japanese original should have produced the sequence 'Wolf andSpice', the reverse is used in the English title; both sequences are used when people talk about the series. The very preference of one sequence of the title's elements over the other might very well show which such element is more important to the viewer. Equally, it will probably betray appreciation of the show as a whole, as one of the two elements is clearly inferior to the other.\\n\\n\r\n-= Wolf =-\\n\r\nOne way of looking at this series is to see it as a traveller's tale, perhaps even one of a budding romance: a story of two companions trekking from place to place to reach their goal and becoming more firm friends with each bump in the road - bumps that are present, partly as that's how roads are, but mostly as a method of giving the travellers something to struggle with and to overcome.\\n\r\nSuch a view can easily enough be taken, since both protagonists, travelling merchant Kraft Lorenz and his companion Holo, have a penchant of running into trouble at each way stop, either of their own making or by coincidence and plot-convenience, and especially since theirs is an age-old adventure tale, a tale of crossing a continent while finding one's way home. The particular angle from which Spice and Wolf looks at this story is noteworthy, though.\\n\\n\r\nKraft Lorenz is one of the more unusual characters concepted within the entirety of anime and manga. A travelling trader owning little but his own horse and carriage and dreaming of making enough money to open a shop, he is hardly an archetypal hero. Nor is he concepted to become one. The focus of his character and his actions lie squarely on his business. A generally upright and decent, if competitive, man, his is a less than overly adventurous life of trying to strike a good deal and staving off bankruptcy, trading in commodities and making the best of opportunities encountered by favourable exchange rates or the novelty of trading on credit. At first glance it may not be the most exciting of lives to watch, but it is made up for by the detail poured in each individual transaction and the worries they bring to someone whose very survival hinges on the successful deal.\\n\r\nThere is also the little fact that he has made a promise to a spirit of an age past, letting this spirit travel with him and helping her search for her far-off home for as long as their routes overlap. His motivation is partly one of expedience, partly one of awe, and partly one of wishing for a companion on the road.\\n\r\nWhile Lorenz is simply a character who is able to assess and laugh about himself and who never strays too far from the path of weighing all his options and usually acting from his thoughts instead of his emotions (somewhat rare in itself), only being overcome at times by the greed his profession might by necessity entail, Holo is what, to many, makes the show memorable.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, there's her concept. She's a 'Roggenwolf', a wolf-spirit from folk legend who was a protector of the rye fields and the harvest; the legend depicted in the anime, including the idea that the wolf hides in the last sheaf of rye, comes directly from the actual legend (although the anime most likely speaks about barley, not rye - it's hard to tell, with 'mugi' meaning barley as well as rye and wheat). But Spice and Wolf adds to this simple notion, mentioning how she agreed to be present in the fields in days when the success of the harvest depended on the whims of nature and the supernatural, only to be forgotten when progress and developing technology made her antiquated, until she roused herself from her placidity, longing to return to her old home, a semi-mythical place where everything was bathed in a brilliant silver.\\n\r\nA being who is not human, Holo is shown to enjoy the marvels of the human world with all the lack of solicitude of a child. Seeing herself as better than humans, she is a trickster, toying with whatever interests her, shown to like mind-games, wittiness and swiftness in conversation, all the while seemingly thoroughly enjoying being pampered, being treated to large amounts of alcoholic beverages and socialising.\\n\r\nWhile this might make her likable, perhaps even charming, it doesn't make her stand out as a character. What does manage to do so is the fact that, every now and again, without too much attention being piled on it, she, and the audience with her, is reminded of the fact that she is, in truth and not only in word, different, a spirit. At such times realisation creeps through that she is, in fact, hundreds of years old and wise in the ways of the world - but in the ways of the world that was and now is gone. She is a stranger in a strange land, having awoken from slumber only to find that what she once knew is lost. It infuses her with a sense of loneliness that might not always be the most convincing, but at least appears to be sincere.\\n\\n\r\nViewed as a traveller's tale, their story is one of visiting new places and getting involved with the goings-on there, either by becoming embroiled in the affairs of that locale or by interacting with the local markets and traders in a professional capacity. The different tales, more or less one per locale, depicting the ideological problem of Holo being a wolf-spirit and the fiasco of investing in something the market is flooded with, among others, focusing on the interaction of the two travelling companions in their persons and professions with the wider world, generally lead to a calm pacing that give the two ample space to converse with each other and their surroundings and developing the bond between such unlikely bedfellows.\\n\r\nAs it should be, that bond is slow to develop. Their travelling together at first being nothing but a marriage of convenience, slowly the practical agreement gains an emotional aspect as trust starts to build up. Equally slowly, their conversations change from the purely economical (in all meanings of that word) to the moral and the emotional, yet both keep their distance, befitting two persons who have only known each other for a short time: though banter is exchanged, sometimes infused with quite a bit of wit and mocking of self, once it starts getting personal both have a tendency to back off unless it is truly important for their travels together. If there is no progress in their relationship, this is because there should not be any: Lorenz and Holo are companions, perhaps friends. By knowing each other, they can work together; by caring, they can travel together. But more would be out of place: they are fundamentally different persons in outlook and goals and their focus on the practical side of things only makes them all the more realistic and mature.\\n\\n\r\n-= Spice =-\\n\r\nLooking at Spice and Wolf as the story of its two protagonists, travelling companions and unlikely friends slowly growing into a stronger relationship is, however, missing the trees for the forest. The super-story isn't but a method to link the little tales together. What makes this series one that stands out from the crowd is the staggering amount of detail poured into the fictional world, a world brought to life in many of its facets by the highly unconventional method of making one of the protagonists a merchant.\\n\r\nAs a trader, Lorenz is bound to explore the cities he travels through and while he does so the audience is treated to a setting that is as evocative as it is true to actual history. Though Spice and Wolf is ostensibly set in a fictional world, it becomes clear very soon that this world is the Central Europe of the late 14th, early 15th centuries in all but name. In particular, the cities appear as the market towns of the late Middle Ages, and the trading guilds mentioned are a clear reference to the rising Italian companies and the Hanseatic League. \\n\\n\r\nThe actual content of the show has little to do with the relationship between Holo and Lorenz, but is squarely focused on immersing the audience in the particulars of the small-scale trade of a time when pepper was worth more than gold. It is this what makes Spice and Wolf different from almost anything else out there, and the series makes the most of it, being sure to place enough emphasis on minute details to bring both the practice of the trade and its mentality to life.\\n\r\nThrough Lorenz and his dealings, the audience is shown the workings of the guilds and bourses of that age, including the modus operandi of the early international trading companies and the limited use (and understanding) of trading on credit, as well as the developing sense of difference between nominal and real value of coinage. While watching Lorenz and Holo exchanging banter, the audience is also shown the more mundane aspects of city life, being taken to watch folk festivals, inns and hostels and a variety of stalls and shops.\\n\r\nThe faithful rendition of historical detail of the setting - utensils, architecture, accoutrements all, and even, for once, the ships - surpasses anything I've seen to date in anime, putting your average (and better-than-average) Renaissance fair to shame. From the exact construction of buildings to the fact that trenchers were usually made of bread, it seems as if every single detail of the daily life of people has been carefully checked and incorporated. It does so well that I was honestly miffed when noticing that one letter shown was written in modern, not mediaeval, German.\\n\\n\r\nEqually striking is the general optimism of the general worldview, a sense that people can understand the world and leave their footprint on it. This, too, is an important part of the portrayed setting and true to historical fact. The time was, and is explained to be in the setting, one of technological progress, one wherein more and more tools were developed to aid agriculture and industry and less and less was dependent on chance. Belief systems focus on the human and their mastery of the world, with nothing standing between man and his God but his own mind, resulting in a general outlook of opportunity, contrasting sharply to most fantasy and historical shows and befitting the more grounded story marvellously.\\n\\n\r\n-= And everything nice =- \\n\r\nAnd then, there is myth. Vague, half-forgotten, impossible but in the dark places of the world. Hidden in plain view, in tales from the countryside and quaint mannerisms of people who should know better, shadows of a system of belief of a world past still remain. Only very seldom made explicit, Spice and Wolf employs one of the more subtle and low-key depictions of magic, neatly integrating it into the overall setting. Spirits being real, they only survive where the remaining tales say they ought to be. Reminding the audience every now and then that there is more to the fictional world than market towns, Holo is made less of a unique phenomenon and her desire to return to a home the continued existence of which she can't even be certain of, is thereby enhanced. The supporting cast, as well, complements the setting very well, living wholly in the world of man's endeavours or still faintly recalling what's outside the walls, considering alchemy to be a science yet still a bit fearful of getting involved in it because of its storied connection to the supernatural.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a series with a slow-moving plot and a lot of dialogue, it was a good choice to try and have each conversation be infused with at least an attempt at wit, and it's nice to see how the failing attempts are often recognised as such by the characters themselves. Always remaining on the safe side of the rational-emotional spectrum, the conversations have a lightness and lack of unnecessary outbursts that keeps the overall tone of the series intact.\\n\\n\r\nMention should further be made of the music. Granted, it's about as standard folk fair as it comes, but it fits the setting, accompanying especially the more festive moments perfectly and has the good graces to sometimes simply not be very good. As far as I can tell, there has been made something of an effort to only use traditional folk instruments and what's left of the musical scores of the time (little of which is certain to be actually old, by the way), and some of these instruments just aren't capable of producing the purer sounds their modern varieties can produce. The opening tune's lyrics also do a very good job of introducing and accompanying the type of story told.\\n\\n\r\n-= Icing and Cake =-\\n\r\nLooking at Spice and Wolf as the tale of Holo and Lorenz is mistaking the icing for the cake. What comes first in this show is the spice, that is, the setting. In many ways, the travels of the protagonists are but a means to show the audience a small piece of a living and breathing world. \\n\r\nOriginal, if not unique, in focus and angle, superbly detailed in setting and at least decent in adding a glue to fit the separate stories together, Spice and Wolf was, to me, 2008's biggest surprise and an instant favourite. I'll admit that my particular interest in the era alluded to makes me biased, but even without it the originality of the concept, the integration of actual and made-up legend in a detailed world and the soothing charm of the low-key telling of the tales would have me recommend it as one of the very few shows that shirk away from the incessant need to bombard audiences with action and suspense, romance and relationship or like topics. \\n\r\nCharming, enjoyable by all age groups, calm and beautiful in its manifold details, Spice and Wolf is a delight to sit down by after a long day and simply enjoy.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf is a Supernatural, Romance, Adventure anime set in a sort of fantasy, European, Medieval world. The story itself revolves around a young travelling merchant (Craft Lawrence), who encounters a legendary wolf god, in the appearance of a cute girl (Holo/Horo) and they end up travelling together. However for those expecting plenty of wolf action or full-on romance may be disappointed. Instead it basically follows their journey from town to town, helping each other on complex business deals, whilst coming across major developments and dilemmas. Of course there are pockets of action & minor romantic developments but those don&rsquo;t play much part untillater on in the short series.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the nature of the story; the main characters don&rsquo;t really stay at one place, so the series lacks recurring characters. But the Craft and Holo duo helps make up for the lack of characters, with their thought provoking and witty comments. Craft is a guy who&rsquo;s usually so full of himself that it&rsquo;s hilarious and Holo is the cute, arrogant, wolf-girl that&rsquo;s there to put Craft in his place. The conversations the 2 have are what make the series worth watching however if you turn off that factory in your head called a brain you are bound to miss something important or amusing.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the animation is sheer amazing. The environments are aesthetically well designed that you&rsquo;ll notice straight away it is strongly influenced by Medieval Europe. The characters and objects move somewhat fluidly and have a general slender design but this series doesn&rsquo;t have many opportunities to show what it&rsquo;s fully capable of.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is a mix of piano melodies complemented by a variety of string and wind instruments, to go well with the medieval theme. Though I must say, the music is extremely catchy that you may start humming the OP or ED themes without even knowing it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Spice and Wolf is definitely something to watch if you want to try something a little unique, or if you&rsquo;re just into girls with a pair of cute ears &amp; a tail; because either way you won&rsquo;t be disappointed. The story may not be all that interesting and neither is the very educational economics and trade involved, nonetheless the well developed, main characters are what make it interesting. With such captivating and hilarious, high-brow conversations between the main characters; it is quite easy to forget about the story that doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s going anywhere, half the time. At least the story does nothing to ruin the clever plot but the ending is pretty unsatisfying and in need of a continuation.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "\"Presented a whole new definition for anime. One of a kind story-plot. Intriguing character relationships.\"\r\nTired of action-based (shounen) anime? Want to try something more \"wordy\" for a change? Spice and wolf will be your ideal candidate in this case! Heavily driven by plot, Spice and Wolf require the viewer to pay 100% attention to the dialogues between characters. It is, however, important to note that the conversations between the characters were so well planned that one will hardly ever feel bored over the course of the series.\r\nSkillfully constructed dialogues throughout the series resulted in a wonderful story full of joy and sorrow. While it canbe confusing to follow at first, the story develops itself slowly and quietly for the first few episodes leading to one climax after another in the short 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality is very consistent throughout the series. Smooth transition from scene to scene really makes it hard for even the \"pickiest\" guy (or girl) to complain. HOWEVER the occasional \"nude\" Horo scenes really frustrates me, not because I don't want to see nudity (heck, who wouldn't want to see Horo naked), but rather it is due to the horrible body line curvature/texture (or whatever you want to call it) of Horo's supposedly \"goddess\" body. It would have been better to keep her covered up instead, the animation crew just completely shattered my fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf have some well known CV voicing the main roles. Lawrence's CV is Jun Fukuyama (Lelouch in Code Geass, Kimihiro Watanuki in xxxHOLiC). Horo's CV is Ami Koshimizu (Kallen in Code Geass, Nina in Mai Otome). Norah's CV is Mai Nakahara (Mai in Mai-HiME and Mai Otome, Nagisa in Clannad, Nagisa in Strawberry Panic). Although I am not a fan of Natsumi Kiyoura who sang the OP, I find the OP suit very well with the overall image of the story.\\n\\n\r\nArtfully woven character relationships (though 90% of the time the focus is on Horo and Lawrence) is one of the strong points of Spice and Wolf. In fact, the special bond developed over time between Horo and Lawrence is one of the keys to the success of the show. The bond shared between the protagonists is so unique that it is rarely seen in modern days anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt is worth noting that Ami Koshimizu used a rather catchy accent to make Horo's character stand out (Horo is known to be \"wise\").\\n\\n\r\nAs previously stated, it is heavy with dialogues and will often make you think. Some people may find it enjoyable while others will just drop it instantly. There wasn't much for me to complain about the overall production of the show (beside the nude Horo) and I do completely enjoy the series from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf delivered what it intended to deliver to its viewers very successfully in one season (13 episodes). The ending was not conclusive since, as we found out a while, a sequel is underway. Although not a masterpiece level of work, Spice and Wolf definitely redefined anime in a whole different way.",

            "content": "\"We won't laugh until we get the money, we won't cry until we go bankrupt.\"\r\nIf one wishes to switch a bit from action and cute-girls-doing-cute-stuff series, and watch a more serious but yet funny and romantic story, this is the perfect choice.\r\nThe quote above, said from Lawrence to Holo, represents one of the main features of the anime: the mixture of an economics theme with slice-fo-life elements. From the surface, it sure seems pretty odd, but when you take a deeper look, you see it blend so well with the storyline that long conversations about price raising and market value -boring to many people- endup as things joyful to watch in a way that it's even possible you get excited over commercial deals just as much as you'd be with a mecha fight.\\n\\n\r\nSpice & Wolf is a smart anime, with a serious tone and a lot of dialogue, however, it doesn't lose its silly moments and sometimes shows a glance of an heartwarming comedy.\\n\r\nAlso, I may clarify for those who are still wondering about it, the fanservice in this series is very close to zero, with the exception of few seconds in specific episodes, there is none of if. Then you might ask me \"oh, but that girl was naked in pics and in the first episode as well, wasn't she?\". Well, of course she was. That girl is a wolf and I've never seen a wild wolf wearing clothes before. With that in mind, there was never such intention to turn this series into an ecchi. I would consider it... realistic (in some extension of course).\\n\r\nThere is indeed some eroticism in the series, most of the female characters do have a slender look. It might have been a marketing maneuver, in order to catch more viewers in the beginning of the series, who knows. \\n\r\nAnyway, it is just a nice eye candy, not a huge appeal and definitely not the major focus of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind, the summary here in MAL is very nice. It sums up the beginning of the story, and without further spoilers leave that scent of mystery on the air. \\n\r\nHow lonely would be travel all by yourself? How important it is to have someone with you?\\n\r\nCraft Lawrence is a peddler traveling by himself for more then 5 years. he was able to establish himself as a somewhat-known merchant in the territories of South and is working hard with a goal in mind. After a while, he arrives in a agricultural village during a spice harvest festival, do  some business, meet up with old friends, and... find a wolf-girl. *ahem* Not just an ordinary wolf-girl, please. She is Holo, The Wise Wolf. To the church, a pagan god. For the villagers, the deity of that region spice harvests. What does she wants with him? What will develop from this? Just watching to find it out.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I found wonderful about this story is the placement and the context of it.\\n\r\nThe fantasy element plays an important role in the story, although, it is not the \"generic style\" of fantasy, common in many anime titles nowadays. \\n\r\nInstead of doing an story full of magic, wizards, knights, titans... and things like that, Spice&Wolf approaches the folklore and tales from the medieval era. The struggle between believers in other divinities and the holy church, gods living between people and holiness protecting and blessing the fields are just the tip of the iceberg that will develop along the storyline.\\n\r\nWhat is marvelous to see, is that even with all this development, scriptwriters were cautious enough to not let this characteristics takes the spotlight of the show, which should and indeed continued to be, economics and Holo & Lawrence relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThis series sure has one of the best classic OST I've ever listened to. \\n\r\nWith the sole exception of ARIA -which has a very similar tone then this series by the way- this was probably the first series I actually paused one episode to search what song was playing and if there were any TABs for it.\\n\r\nAlong with a great performance, the sound direction in this anime was also superb. Since I'm already on the topic, I'd take a moment to emphasize the difference some VoiceActors can make in an story. Something that I was amused by was the characteristics and the accent they attributed to some characters speech. The geographic location of them would change their way of speaking and some slang, while Holo for example, talks in a completely different way from other characters. She uses an old dialect from Edo period Tokyo. \\n\r\nIt is great to see that someone did cared about this details. Think about it, indeed  would be weird for a 600+ years old wolf, to talk modern Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf brings up a deep psychological analysis of characters and a lot of development.\\n\r\nDo not expect simple or formulaic characters and never underestimate Holo's personality\u2019s complexity.\\n\r\nThis being a slice-of-life series, of course it would focus on dialogues and characters themselves, however the way these chars interacts with the environment and how the scenario contributes to the normal flow of the story and conversations was also carefully thought. \\n\r\nThe collabo between animators and writers succeeded into this great \"visual interaction\" with characters expressions, allied with a marvelous voice acting already mentioned. One notorious example of it, is Holo's physical reactions to some emotions, where instead of just blushing, she would sometimes raise her ears or move her tail.\\n\r\nThat said, I have no complains with the artwork. In some episodes it was visible that few scenes were rushed, but besides from minor weird camera angles and some lines in the wrong place, there is nothing else to complain.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I'm still enjoying its \"afterglow\".\\n\r\nIt was sure over my expectations. I dislike doing \"generic\" recommendations, but this title is something everyone should watch. But there is a right time for it. If you are new to anime, or if your list contains mostly action/mecha shounen, this is not the right time to watch it. On the other hand, if you're already used to romance or medieval themed dramas this would be a nice pick. Give it a try! Unless you have horror to economics or suffer from fear to math and/or long dialogues, you won't regret it.\\n\r\nI wonder why is this series not very popular... It isn't underrated, as we can see, the score it holds here in MAL isn't that high but still above average. But the ranking of popularity is awful low. Maybe due to the studio who made it isn't that famous? \\n\r\nIt is a jewel in a dunghill after all.\\n\r\nAlong with this, I would recommend for anyone who enjoyed it, to read the Light Novels. Since the anime adaptation of season 2 just cover till chapter 5, it stops right in the middle of the adventure, which is a pain. While we hope for a 3rd season, read the books!",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nAre you tired of action shonen series with a fighting tournament every 2 story arcs? Want to see something different? Anime has many different genres from which to choose: psychological drama, slice of life, echii comedy, sports, etc. How about something REALLY different? An anime centered around trading that mainly teaches the viewer principals of economics like inflation, buying on margin, and short selling stock? Spice and Wolf is a show so uniquely odd that I had a hard time convincing my friends that it actually exists. This is an anime so dialogue heavy and business oriented that it would likely get better ratings onBloomberg than on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. Spice and Wolf also has some well written romance and great characters, so even if you aren't into economics, there is still a chance you will like it.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Spice and Wolf seems simple, but it is very well written and can actually teach the viewer something. It would be an understatement to say that Spice and Wolf is much better at teaching economics principals than Hetalia is at teaching history. For an anime to have such a daringly unique and unconventional story in today's consumer driven media is extraordinary. The setting in medieval Europe reminds me of the famous economic author Ludwig Von Mises and his tendency to use Robinson Crusoe to simplify and better explain complex fiscal theories.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins when a travelling merchant discovers an unusual girl with dog ears and a tail lying naked in the pile of wheat he is transporting. Lawrence is obviously shocked by this, but the mysterious girl Holo claims to be a Goddess that controls the harvest and now wishes to leave this village because the farmers no longer believe in her. Lawrence is skeptical, but Holo offers to prove that she is a wolf goddess by transforming in front of him and causing him to faint from sheer terror. Later that night, Holo appears before Lawrence again and convinces him to take her along with him since she needs to travel with wheat as a harvest deity. This is sort of like Dracula and his need to travel with his coffin and soil of Romania. Holo offers her wise advice she has gained from centuries of living to help Lawrence in the world of trading, and Lawrence in turn will eventually take her back to her birthplace in the far north country of Yoitsu.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters are Kraft Lawrence and the wolf goddess, Holo. Kraft Lawrence is a very believable and realistic protagonist. He is a medieval merchant that at first mostly cares about profit and seems to have a Randian Objectivist outlook. However, as the series goes on we see that he does have a heart and he grows as a character. Lawrence doesn't conform to the stereotypes of anime romance leads. He isn't a pushover that lets a harem of girls beat him up all the time. He isn't a secret pervert that gets nosebleeds at the slightest provocation. He isn't a musclebound hero that rescues random damsels in distress. What he is, is a well rounded character that seems like a real person. Since this is tagged as a Romance title, it is not a spoiler that Lawrence eventually begins to develop some feelings for Holo. However, he is reserved with his feelings and doesn't rush head first into a relationship. Lawrence is calm and calculating as one would expect from a medieval broker. The other character is Holo, who calls herself the \"Wise Wolf\". Holo is centuries old deity that can help crops grow and bring bountiful harvests. However, as mentioned above, she has been abandoned for a new God, which is sort of the Spice and Wolf universe's version of Christianity. This new monotheism denounces the old Gods despite the viewer knowing for a fact that they exist and believes only in 1 God, which the viewer never sees any evidence exists. However, Holo doesn't take revenge because she is not a \"jealous God\" as God Himself said in the Old Testament. Holo is a very bored god that lives in the field of wheat and longs to return to the place she was born. How Gods are born in this series has yet to be explained as of the end of season 2, but it isn't particularly important. The important thing is that she wishes to return to the land of Yoitsu in the far north. Yoitsu is a very vast land with lots of snow, lots of wolves, and few people. If Holo is an accurate representative of the population, the people of Yoitsu seem to have hair trigger tempers and a propensity to get sauced. I honestly wonder why the English dub didn't just give her a Russian accent and be done with it. Holo is in fact quite wise and knows the ways of the world through her centuries of life. However, she can often act immaturely and has a very sharp tongue. It is shown quite often that Holo is very cautious about developing feelings for a mortal, because she knows that she will be alive for centuries after her love has died. Like Lawrence, Holo is a well rounded and believable character that doesn't just fit into an established mold like \"tsundere\" or \"yandere\". A point of criticism from some viewers revolves around Holo's lack of shyness in regards to nudity. The nudity in Spice and Wolf though is very mild and avoids showing nipples or any detailed bits feminine anatomy. It is far more artistic than erotic and realistically displays the attitude that a God would have around mere humans.\\n\\n\r\nSound Track: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFrom the absolutely beautiful opening theme to the sickeningly sweet ending theme, Spice and Wolf has a solid OST. The soundtrack is heavy on flute pieces and seems to fit the environment of an alternate Medieval Europe. My only criticism is that some tracks sound a little too silly like the track \"Kenshi to Yopparai\" which bares a striking resemblance to the famous Torgo theme from \"Manos\".\\n\\n\r\nArt:  5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character drawings are fine, but art isn't really the strong point of this series. The animation is normally OK, but there are scenes that are so poorly animated that it causes unintentional hilarity. Just type: \"Spice and Wolf horse\" into youtube and see what I mean. Those scenes with horrendous animation are few and far between, but they are in fact there and stick out like a sore thumb.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI will say that this is a very dialogue heavy anime. There is little action and that alone may throw off many viewers. Parts of the series can get confusing, so if you can't quite wrap your head around an economic concept or a certain sub-plot, don't be afraid to rewind and watch again. This is especially true if you are watching the subbed version and aren't a very fast reader. Spice and Wolf is not an anime for everyone like Cowboy Bebop or Attack on Titan. It doesn't go for a calculated line drive when it can go all out and swing for the fences. As a result, Spice and Wolf will either be a strikeout or an out of the park home run depending on the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf is the kind of anime that only comes around once in a long while. It is a daring and unique series that everyone should at least try. If you watch the first 6 episodes and absolutely hate it (like most of my friends), that is OK. You don't need to torture yourself and finish the whole thing. However, if you have the desire to keep watching, it is a series that won't disappoint.",

            "content": "I've noticed that the vast majority of the reviews for this series are absolutely glowing, which is the reason I decided to give my input. After having watched it (save for that mysterious 7th DVD-only episode), I thought I'd write a review so that people with my tastes might get a little more perspective on the series. \r\n~Story~\r\nThe story is actually fairly interesting and has a good foundation: a merchant happens upon the incarnation of a wolf God while conducting business in a small town. He promises to escort the wolf home to the north and off they go on medieval merchant inspired adventures. It'soriginal and intriguing, but the execution of the main ideas leaves something to be desired. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the very start, I feel like we the viewers are left with gaps in the overall story. Horo, the wolf, never really explains how exactly she came to be the wheat God for the village in which she and Lawrence, the merchant, meet. It is somewhat implied, but this is never fully explored. Okay. No big deal. The story is still interesting. However, the gaps in info. don't end there. I'd personally like to know why in the world and how in the world she is connected to wheat. She's a wolf, so how did she become so reliant upon wheat? And can that connection ever be broken? Sadly, this is something that is pretty much ignored. The ending of the series is also very open-ended and ambiguous. Now, maybe there's a second season in the works, but it still seemed like a rather random and unsatifactory ending to me. It sort of tied up some overarching themes and concluded the final subarc, but it just felt unfinished to me because it failed to progress the main plot.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I felt was unsatisfactory was how they presented the various economic nuances and dilemmas of the protagonists. It was very difficult for me to figure out what was going on whenever they started talking about debts wrought by miscalculated contracts and the inner workings of bartering businesses. I felt like my confusion could have easily been cleared up had they bothered to add a sentence or two explaining the situation in layman's terms. For example, the movie &quot;The Producers&quot;, which also deals with understanding how an economic risk works, I understood because of the scene in which Bloom explains how their scheme could scam the system. For &quot;Spice and Wolf&quot;, there was no such equivalent explanation scene. They tried to explain things but did it in a fashion that presumes that the viewer already grasps the basic situation. Hece, confusion. \\n\\n\r\n~Art~\\n\\n\r\nAs has been pointed out by the other reviews, the artwork for the series really is high-calibre, especially in relation to the backgrounds and buildings. So, why didn't this section get a 10 out 0f 10 from me? Two reasons: 1. the way they drew noses for straight-on headshots was pretty shoddy at times by using only a bent line to indicate the nose, 2. they often drew Lawrence in such a way that it looked like he had a double chin. Yes, yes, nit-picky, I know, but the double-chin thing in particular really bothered me and they did it consistently throughout the series. I think they were trying to make it look more realistic (your chin does do weird things when you clench your jaw and/or lower your head) but it just came off looking awkward.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of the series was superb both in the sound effects department and openings and endings department. There was one scene in particular which I was impressed by because they included realistic sounds mimicking how someone's bare feet would sound running on stone. The openning theme is slow and methodic, fits the show well, and was so enjoyable that I only skipped it for one episode. The ending theme is cutesy...and weird. But not uncharming. \\n\\n\r\n~Character~\\n\\n\r\nThis is the section in which I deviate most strongly from what the other reviews have said. Horo is a nice enough character, but I found myself usually more annoyed by her than engrossed. There were just a couple of things that she did that really grated on my nerves, and had she been a real acquaintance of mine, I would have smacked her. For example, the scene in which she uses Lawerence's money to buy apples, hits him when he tries to eat one, and when he points out that she bought them with his money so he's entitled, she claims, &quot;I can get money whenever I need it.&quot; I would have kicked any friend who did that to me off the cart. I don't find such behavior endearing or cute, but selfish and bratty. \\n\\n\r\nShe also had the tendecy to always act superior and constantly say &quot;I am Horo the wise!&quot; Aside from scamming a merchant, concocting one plan, and determining the validity of one or two things, she doesn't really do anything &quot;wise.&quot; In fact, when it comes to relationships and helping Lawrence out of tight situations, she's pretty useless. Or at least, that's how it seemd to me. Her arrogance just bugged me. Oh! And as I just stated, she scams this one merchant and that reeeeeaaallly bothered me considering said merchant had done nothing wrong and originally offered Lawrence a really good price for his wares. The merchant takes it in stride, but that doesn't make conning honest business men out of their money any more right. Okay, so it's the game of merchanting to get the most money you can, but that doesn't mean that every merchant should sink to the corrupt system's level. \\n\\n\r\nOther than Horo, my main beef with the characters is that they weren't very dynamic or developed. They're realistic enough but all rather flat and forgettable. \\n\\n\r\n~Miscellaneous~\\n\\n\r\nTwo other things to note: 1. the dialogue at times is somewhat nonsensical and doesn't flow particulatly well, 2. there should have been more Horo in wolf form action. I gotta say that Horo in wolf form was awesome. I liked her in wolf form (for all the things I dislike about her otherwise), and I really wish they'd focused more on that. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's not a bad series, not at all, but it's not fantastic either. It's decent and seems like it's more of a work in progress waiting for some more touching up. Hopefully, people interested in watching it will take the time to read all the reviews and compare their lists with the users who left them to determine whether or not it's for them. Then again, if you've got time to burn anyway, giving it a chance won't be detrimental.",

            "content": "I saw this anime because of a few recommendations online and several glowing reviews, however upon watching Spice and Wolf I have to wonder how old the writers of these reviews are that they can find this enjoyable. If you've read any other review on this show, you'll know it is praised for its \"character depth\" and its use of economics. Let me warn you ahead of time, I have seen puddles with more depth than these characters. They are extremely 2 dimensional, the dialogue might as well have been written by a junior high student, and the monotonous tone of the voice acting isappalling. As to the economics so heavily praised by viewers, it is hardly a fair trade for a good story. When the subject is brought up, it sounds more like the characters are reading from a textbook rather than furthering the story. It basically consists of an economic buzzword being said, followed by the definition, in other words the show is extremely full of parrot expositions.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of the show also leaves something to be desired, as there is little to no music, almost exclusively dialogue and ambient noise, which I understand was the intent, and could be quite powerful if done correctly. Unfortunately, it was not. Instead of using this tactic to emphasize important and deep scenes, the entirety of the show is treated the same and the viewer is quickly desensitized to the effect and no emphasis  is ever placed on anything. When music is actually used, it tends to be poor quality and rather obnoxious, typically played over conversation which was clearly intended to make the conversation seem fun and uplifting but ends up causing the opposite.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of the show is average quality and I really have no comment on it.\\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat, we are greeted by both Lawrence's friend provocatively discussing a business transaction and Holo explaining nonverabally how comfortable she is nude, and how frequently you can expect to see her that way. At this point you would expect that fanservicing will be the downfall of this show but overall what ruined the show for me was the abysmal dialogue and  utter lack of real character depth. As I continued to watch I noticed that the closest thing I could compare this show to, both in character and in dialogue would be Twilight. The obnoxious amount of exposition tropes is also reminiscent of your typical shonen. \\n\\n\r\nI expect the crowd who actually do care for this show are coming from a background in Naruto or One Piece, which were also not my cup of tea. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: If you are below the age of 16 and have never seen anything with a more dynamic story than Naruto, you may enjoy Spice and Wolf, you may even praise it for the greatest characters ever written. But for the adults reading this article who are looking for a show with legitimate character development and an enthralling story, look elsewhere.",

            "content": "Wolves are beautiful creatures to look at. You see them prowling around the woods with their pack and rule the territory that they claim as their own. There is no doubt that they have been the focal point in some anime shows over the years, but when have you seem them being used as an intelligent focal point in a show's narrative? Out comes Spice and Wolf, a tale that follows two of our heroes in their journey involving mercantilism, to convince us once and for all that you can pull off a simple concept and make something brilliant out of it.\r\nSpice and Wolf setsup as your typical traveler's type of story where we follow Kraft Lawrence, a traveling merchant who deals with trading anything that is profitable and makes a fortune out of it. He is then confronted with a Wolf goddess named Holo who wants to come with him in his travels and help him with his business for reasons that involve trying to establish a bond between Kraft and her. What is very fascinating about the relationship between our two main leads is how perfectly paced the bond is between Holo and Kraft. There is no awkward transition between the two automatically becoming lovers over the course of a day or two into the story, or in this case episodes if we're being more formal here. The show takes it's time to build it up slowly so that we can breathe into the scenes that involve them talking to one another and displays them increasing their relationship's strength in a realistic fashion than relying on pointless melodrama. Not there is not any drama between the two but it doesn't come across as being hammy or out-of-place, it fits well with the scene it portrays and succeeds quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nIt also helps to the show's credit that the way Kraft and Holo enhance their relationship isn't just through romantic dialog or dialog that only involve positive responses, they get into arguments, they disagree a lot, and things don't always work out between each others plans. Just like what a real relationship is like for most people. You see this a lot in anime and movies that tackle romance in a formulaic style that doesn't seem very organic or pragmatic from how relationships are really like in a real world setting. Not that portraying relationships in that way is bad, but it's refreshing to see something like Spice and Wolf pull it off and do it in a successful way.\\n\\n\r\nNow let us talk about both characters individually. To my surprise, Kraft turned into a very memorable male lead by the simple fact that they build him up around an archetype that could have easily been bland or generic. I say this because when you deconstruct Kraft as a character, there really isn't that much to go around other than that he's just a simple merchant and nothing else but the way they write him as this strong individualistic character who can handle any given situation with ease comes at a shock considering how Kraft has to one up Holo in terms of character traits. Now Holo, the main star of the show, is one of, if not, the greatest female leads that has ever graced the screen. She's witty, sly, and is an absolute joy to watch when she is front and center. Normally any character like Holo could be looked as a cheap way of shoving in nudity or a generic female character to spice things up, no pun intended. With Spice and Wolf the way it handles Holo's development and personality is very mature and charming in the witty writing that she is given that definitely makes for an interesting character study of how Holo and Kraft come across as very believable characters in how they carry the story forward in a delightful aspect.\\n\\n\r\nThe story's writing, while relying heavily on economic theory, is top-notch and lenient to where it isn't necessarily hard to understand what is going on. Spice and Wolf's economics is grounded upon Medieval lore, where the economy was a little simpler to understand than in today's economic system. What really works well in this demeanor is how it doesn't drag on the narrative too much. How the characters explain their economic motives is not only interesting in an intellectual standpoint but also makes for a strong gripping drama from the way it trickles down to Kraft's eventually economic troubles. Even if you are not a scholar in an economic school, you can still feel the pressure that Kraft and Holo are going through when the eventual climax sets in when they have to find out a way to get out of their debt. How they portray the politics that involve heavily with the church is intellectually honest in how things were running in the era and they portray it with the narrative to good effect on how bribery and trading being done on a daily basis between the economic markets that existed in the past.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically, Spice and Wolf doesn't break any new ground in regards to animation but the backgrounds and the character designs are all done superfluously well. The lush colors in the backgrounds of the mountains and trees, the grimy walls that inhabit the cities and towns they go through, and the darkness that surrounds them really add to the atmosphere that make you feel like you're really looking at a Medieval world. While the animation isn't special, the scenes that involve Holo's wolf transformation were done with good effect in its direction to make it mysterious and dark to let us know that she is a living breathing goddess.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and voice acting do their jobs well although the music itself wasn't anything that stood up as highlights of the show. It features music that fits well to the setting that involves a nice orchestral score that adds to the overall feel of every scene. However the voice acting is exceptionally well done, the main contender for being the best one is Ami Koshimizu. Her sultry remarks with her sly voice for an entertaining listen. That and with Jun Fukuyama's straight man personality make for the great chemistry between the two leads even better in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nAll things considered, Spice and Wolf is a glorious achievement to witness for anyone looking for great storytelling and a great world to experience. It is near perfect with its brilliant character development and astounding use of political themes to meet a well-balanced character story. It's the type that once you finish you want to experience more of its world but not in a negative sense where they do a poor job of expanding it's plot and world to full effect. Spice and Wolf does the exact opposite where you're fulfilled with joy in being shown this contextual landscape to great effect and you hunger for more exploration. The only way to do that for the creators of shows consistent to Spice and Wolf is to look over the show's horizon and embellish the story to new heights with the setting and characters. There's no telling whether it will succeed or fail but it's the effort that definitely counts.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A",

            "content": "It's an anime about economics. And cheating out of economics with a giant wolf.\r\nSTORY - Seriously. It's a show about medieval economics and how the church influenced businesses at the time. The series thus involves a lot of talking heads, and there isn't a whole lot of action, making it a potential turn-off for people who dislike long-winded explanations. Despite this, there is an actual story beyond the educational rambling which, surprisingly, isn't really exposition at all. Spice and Wolf can almost be considered a semi-historical slice-of-life in that it follows the day-to-day activities of a traveling merchant... and his wolf girl companion. It followstheir monetary triumphs and losses and explores the difficulties associated with traveling with a pagan deity when the church is as strong as it is.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely found this to be a very original concept, but even though it's a short series, it took me a while to get into it. The first four or five episodes moved incredibly slow for me and consequently, it took me several months to move past them. Economics is a topic I think schools should cover sooner and in more depth, especially in today's economy, but if you already know your economics, then a lot of the explanations can be irritating and hard to sit through. After the first few lessons though, the story really picks up with drama and tension and serious business and it's easy to finish the second half of the series in one sitting. \\n\\n\r\nInterestingly enough, the relationship between the church and business is really stressed throughout this series, and at times, Spice and Wolf felt very anti-Christianity -- or at least, anti-church. It exposes the power and almost dictatorial authority the church had over the people, their lives, and their businesses. For any religious folk planning on watching the series, I think it's important to keep in mind that this is a historic time period and the corruptions inside the church system were very real -- the series isn't bashing Christianity so much as its giving an accurate critique of history.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - The depth of the characters is always an important aspect of any series, but I think they become even more important in a character-centered and otherwise relatively simple story like this. Lawrence and Horo are really the only characters of consequence here, and honestly, Lawrence is a pretty typical protagonist -- he's a nice, down-to-earth guy, but a shrewd businessman (it's his trade, after all). Horo, however, balances out his normalcy by being generally unpredictable, cheeky, and stubborn. Her antics and mood seem to change suddenly and abruptly at first, but after a while, you get used to it, and you understand why she is the way she is.\\n\\n\r\nHoro's past is not particularly intriguing or original, but the character she is because of it is incredibly interesting in its realism. Horo is definitely a character I can imagine as an actual person; her emotions, reactions to events, and most of all, her relationship with Lawrence reminds me a lot of the dynamics between real people. They way they bickered and they way they looked out for one another was stupidly simple sometimes, but that showed that their creators weren't trying too hard to be something amazing, and that simpleness really worked. ...It's hard to explain, and I'll be the first to say that I wasn't all that impressed with Horo at first, but as the story progressed into that dramatic second half, the depth of her character and her relationship with Lawrence just pulled everything together.\\n\\n\r\nARTSTYLE &amp; ANIMATION - I don't really like the art in Spice and Wolf. It's exceedingly plain for the most part, and I was bothered by Horo's larger-than-need-be eyes in some scenes. Well, duh, it's anime, you say, but... I don't know. I've seen plenty of other big-eyed styles, but this particular one bothered me? Something was off with the proportion of her face (and other female faces) and I didn't like it. It also always, always annoys the hell out of me when an animal is supposed to be a wolf, but they give it a fox tail. Wolves don't have long bushy, white-tipped tails, sorry. I also wasn't impressed by Horo's wolf form, but I've yet to be impressed (artwise) by any anime wolf. That's probably just me, my affinity towards wolves, and my resulting grumpiness though.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was also about average.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - Excellent. Both theme songs are both deliciously fitting for the series, and the end theme in particular is absolutely adorable. The music during the series is also wonderfully appropriate, and it's one of those soundtracks that I'd definitely recommend picking up. \\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING - Also excellent. Jun Fukuyama has a really versatile voice, and despite the fact that I was watching Code Geass R2 concurrently with some of Spice and Wolf, I never really got the impression that Lawrence sounded anything like Lelouch. Like I said though, Lawrence is a pretty typical protagonist and thus had a pretty typical-sounding voice. In those rare moments when his emotions were at an extreme though, Fukuyama really shines through. Ami Koshimizu was a little more recognizable, but it's also not hard to shed previous perceptions of her voice. I really love that these voice actors actually act instead of just providing one typecasted voice that's recycled for similar characters over and over again. I really loved Koshimizu's performance as Horo -- it definitely had a big hand in enhancing the wolf's overall character.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - Spice and Wolf is a unique little series, and if you're patient and up for something a bit different, I'd definitely recommend it. If you're up for some lessons in basic economics, great! The beginning feels a little generic and unimpressive, but it definitely gets better. This is also probably the only series I've seen in recent memory where an add-on, unplanned second season doesn't seem like such a bad idea. The conclusion of the series here is plenty open-ended, but works well enough as an ending if it needs to. Then again, Spice and Wolf was adapted from light novels, and I'm not sure whether this original season touched on the entire story -- regardless though, I'm looking forward to that second season. :3",

            "content": "In one word, spectacular.\r\nSpice and Wolf is a long journey filled with heaps of dialogue and economics, just keep that in mind when deciding to watch it.\r\nStory: Spice and Wolf is set in the medieval in a land that appears to take inspiration from European countries. Our story begins with the introduction of Kraft Lawrence, a travelling merchant who while on his way from town, is approached by the wolf goddess who goes by the name of Holo the Wise Wolf. Who asks to accompany Lawrence on his travels so she can return to her home in the snowy north. From here on out thisis a journey filled with heartwarming and fun filled adventure between the two as they ride together selling goods and getting into trouble. All around a great, interesting and inventive concept.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is partly Spice and Wolf's most charming feature. The interactions that take place between Holo and Lawrence will keep you engaged and smiling throughout the entire series. The quirky and witty conversations that take place at any given chance in this show is the icing on the cake, easily creating a lively and warming atmosphere. Along the journey we will meet a couple of characters who will be introduced and have an important role in certain story arcs. While it could have been done slightly better if was by no means bad and each character was great fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound: while I am a big fan of the opening song for this show it should be said that while the sound is far from anything below average for this excellent show, they are not the strongest aspect of the anime. Never will the sounds be lackluster for this show, with its solid OST filled with nice tracks and great background noises. This anime has good solid sounds which will help immerse you into the world.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Spice and Wolf has a nice and very suitable art style. It has plenty of detail on both the characters individual designs, as well as the background artwork. The style of art chosen for this show reflects well with the time period set, helping to make the show feel more relaxed and alive at the same time. The colour pallet chosen for this show was also nice with a deep lively green and beautiful autumn oranges for the leaves, which absolutely caught my attention.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Throughout the show I was entertained by both the story and the dialogue which helped keep the show alive. It's important to however mention that economic speeches and context are used on a regular basis, while to the large majority of people it is simple and quick to grasp, some may find it can make the show rather stale and boring. That opinion will change per person and is up to you to find your view on it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show was a beautifully executed piece of artwork which will keep you entertained and excited for the whole show. Probably leading you to both watch the second season and then read the light novels and manga.\\n",

            "content": "Personally I did not especially enjoy &ldquo;Spice And Wolf&rdquo; for what it was originally advertised, its dealings and plots involving medieval economics. Those sounded promising but proved to be a bit too difficult for me to fully grasp and really enjoy. Sure, the various aspects of economy, trading and business were interesting and quite unique to see portrayed in an anime series like that, but in the end they did not seem to be able to bring it in such a way that it provided grasping plot material. The fact on most occasions they resorted to standard action events (double-crossings, betrayal, attack by wild wolves,...)to spice up -pun intended- the plot and various business dealings did not really help either.\\n\\n\r\nWhat made &ldquo;Spice And Wolf&rdquo; a real joy to watch for me were the characters, Horo, Lawrence and their relationship, especially their conversations were terrific. \\n\r\nBoth Horo and Lawrence were interesting characters by themselves with the necessary depth to make them more three dimensional. \\n\r\nHoro may be the wolf deity aged over several hundreds of years who proclaims she's known as &ldquo;Horo the Wise&rdquo; and often portrays insight and wit into humans and their many dealings, regardless of that, she is shown to feel lonely, vie for Lawrence's affection and to be jealous when she'd think his eyes would stray. Lawrence on his end may be an experienced merchant, he still has much to learn and even though he seems to be a  kind person that firmly believes in his principles, he does  not shy away to condemn that -or those- which he disapproves of.\\n\\n\r\nThe pairing of the two leading characters and their interaction make for the bulk of interesting scenes and plot the series has to offer, next to Horo being an enticing leading character, they end up carrying the entire series.\\n\r\nHoro and Lawrence's budding relationship is especially interesting and deserves further development as their love has unique implications since Horo does not only age differently, she simply isn't human, her human appearance is merely a disguise. Seeing them both attracted and attached to each other regardless of those facts is not only romantic but interesting to see. (Similar plots arose in series such as &ldquo;Chobits&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ghost In The Shell: Stand-Alone Complex&rdquo;, although it involved androids and humans in those series.)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was good and consistent throughout the series, it did not especially excel but never dropped either. Backgrounds were nearly always lush paintings which aided to give the series its medieval atmosphere. \\n\r\nCharacters such as Horo and Lawrence received a lot of attention and Horo was always well animated which helps in showing the different facets of her character. The first episode may give off a wrong impression since Horo is drawn 'naked' throughout most of it but her nudity is never really used as a fanservice medium but oft as a plot device to show that with her being a wolf and not a human being, she deals differently with her human appearance. The absence of clothes for her is not an absence of defence or a means to gain advantage through the sensuality of the naked human form.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack supported the scenes well and was able to convey a medieval touch with its abundant use of violins. I personally didn't care much for the ED song though, it sounded a bit too odd.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for an interesting series that deals with serious economic principles, I'm not sure &ldquo;Spice And Wolf&rdquo; will really bring you what you seek. Instead, I'd recommend it more if you want to see a nice character pair interaction that thrives on its dialogues and developing bond.\\n\r\nAnd if you like cute wolf girls, you can't afford to miss this series!",

            "content": "At first I was baffled what kind of anime is S&W and would it leave an impression on me when I watched it. Happily enough, it did and with a fresh genre that it introduced for today's generation.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nMaking a breakthrough using \"economy\" and \"trade\" as the main theme, it is a fresh approach that was injected to the mostly underrated medieval theme anime series without the fancy mahou or sword-and-damsels-in-distress approach. The story would be slow at first but will pick-up for most 1st time watchers.\r\nArt: 9/10\r\nIMAGIN studio did a great work in making this series to suit a medieval atmosphere for the viewer.The graphic and art is very good with the golden fields of wheat to the dark forests of the countryside that makes one to be fully absorbed into it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nAs I expected, orchestral music was used to simulate the theme for the anime and it was very good although it was a bit tedious that they would re-use them most of the time as the series progresses. The OP and ED theme fitted the theme and gives you a mellow and warm feeling.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nHORO~! Well, who could love or hate her? Lawrence too and some of the other characters in the series. Although character development was not much of a factor, their expressions and attitude are enough to entice us to either love OR hate them in a way. ^__^\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI rarely enjoy a SHORT anime series such as S&amp;W but it did for me. Most of the feeling comes from Lawrence and Horo arguing to each other and of course the trades of being a merchant. What lacks maybe is more romanticism since medieval themed ones like this is all about romance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nA great series BUT TOO DAMN SHORT, Spice and Wolf is definitely a very good series to watch not because of its exquisite art or marketing, but how the author was able to create a fresh genre of &quot;economic anime&quot; that would surprise even for me who watches them for a long time.",

            "content": "Usually, when one thinks of fantasy, sword-wielding heroes and epic battles are the first things that come to mind. Indeed, these are the norm for the genre. While there are some great stories that fit into this description, such as Lord of the Rings, or Berserk (to name an anime), the genre can feel quite stale. In this sea of monotonous tales, Spice and Wolf provides a refreshingly different take on the genre. It is a charming, laid-back tale that treads in territory scarcely explored in fantasy: Economics.\r\nKraft Lawrence is a traveling peddler. Traveling from place to place in order to make a profit, heleads a rather lonely life. That is, until he finds he has picked up a hitchhiker. A girl, with the ears and tail of a wolf. She claims to be Holo, the harvest god of a near by town, and requests to travel with Lawrence until they reach her homeland in the north. Though hesitant at first, Lawrence decides they could travel together, as he figures that traveling with a deity could benefit him. However, his new companion may be more trouble than he expected. \\n\\n\r\nThough the concept of a fantasy revolving around economics seems disastrous, Spice and Wolf pulls it off amazingly well. Despite being 90% dialogue, this anime is always involving and never dull. It creates a rich medieval world full of interesting  and likable individuals, and turns the seemingly boring topic of economics into something truly fascinating. This is due, in no small part, to the fantastic characterizations and chemistry of the leads.\\n\\n\r\nHolo is one of the most endearing female leads in recent memory. She can often be fickle, flirtatious, jealous, vindictive, and a real tease; throughout it all she is always charming and a joy to behold. However, she also has a more sensitive side, and a strong desire to not be alone. This is usually masked by her self-assured demeanor, but it gives her character genuine depth, and her moments of vulnerability are some the the show's best. Though he does not quite have the star power of Holo, Lawrence has perfect chemistry with his companion. His market-savvy outlook balances Holo's more primal outlook incredibly well; plus he can match her in wit. On top of that, there is Holo constantly teasing him and sending mixed messages. The result of this chemistry enthralling. Most of the time in any given episode is dedicated to Holo and Lawrence in extensive conversation, but it never becomes tedious to watch. It's just as fun to watch Holo tease Lawrence as it is to see her fight off a gang of thugs in wolf form. The rest of the cast fall firmly into supporting roles, none can hope to steal the spotlight from the leads. This is not to say they are bland or boring, quite the contrary. It is that they are all just people who Holo and Lawrence come across, and as such it is hard to really attach to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe theme of economics is used very well, and is the driving factor in the show. Most of the conflict does not come from Holo's identity of a wolf deity, but from Lawrence's business dealings. This is good because it makes the whole idea of economics part of the plot, instead of just some gimmick to distinguish itself from other anime fantasy. The flip side to this is that the story arcs can be quite predictable: Lawrence makes a business dealing, it turns out to be more than it seems, he and Holo work together to solve the predicament; occasionally Holo uses her wolf form. That's about the extent of what happens in a story arc. This is likely due to the plot's laid-back nature, it is simply about Lawrence and Holo traveling to Holo's homeland in the north and the business dealings they have along the way. Make no mistake, there are some deeper themes about Lawrence and Holo's mutual loneliness, and the difference in their live spans (Holo already being a few hundred years old), but these are merely brought up rather than dealt with. This laid-back approach may be a bit off-putting to those looking for a more gripping plot, but there is just so much to enjoy that it hardly matters.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side, Spice and Wolf is superb. The both the character designs and backgrounds are appropriate to the show's setting. The lively cities, small towns, and vast undeveloped land illustrated create a convincing Middle-age European style world. Not a single character looks out of place in this world, their designs reflect the setting of the story as well as their social status. From modest town folk to regal lords, each character is designed accordingly. Then, of course, there is Holo's character design; never before have ears and a tail looked so good on a character. It is not just that her character design is attractive (and it certainly is attractive), it is the unique way her personality is expressed. Whether Holo is being a flirt or having a more vulnerable moment, her mood at any given moment can be seen clearly through her ears and tail. It is a brilliant use of body language, and a surprisingly seldom used one (considering how many anime characters are running around with animal ears and tails). The music also fits the setting incredibly well, sounding like something that would be played during the era. It is usually light-spirited, pleasantly supporting the long stretches of dialogue between characters. However, when called to do so, the music can tenses up to build excitement in the more dramatic moments; it can also be heartrending during the more tender moments.\\n\\n\r\nThough seeming a bit to laid-back at times, Spice and Wolf is a fascinating take on a genre that is dominated by trite sword-wielding adventures. It has one of the strongest couple of leads in recent memory, and the world they explore is well detailed and wholly believable. For those looking for something out of the norm for the fantasy genre, this is one show not to be missed.",

            "content": "The driving force behind any action we take can be attributed to the profit as a result of said action. Whether that profit is tangible or intangible, our lives are loosely based on a \"avoid punishments and collect rewards\" mentality. Yet, it is strange. We sacrifice our health in order to acquire wealth only to spend that surplus to recuperate our well being. In that sense, it is seemingly irrational for us to work without pause in with the hope that our efforts will be handsomely rewarded.\r\nHowever, people continue to do so, sweating tears and blood in the process. Ookami to Koushinryou, also known asSpice and Wolf, explores this theme with a supernatural, medival, and romantical flair. Through the utilization of cleverly written dialogues and exchanges, a memorable cast of characters, and intriguing arcs, Spice and Wolf presents fundamental financial concepts and human relationships in a witty and interesting way.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the show is built upon the relationship formed by chance between Kraft Lawrence, a traveling merchant, and Horo, a wolf deity who oversees the harvest. Under the agreement that Lawrence guides Horo to her homeland in the north, the two begin to travel together, creating fond memories, facing hardships, and of course, conducting business together.\\n\\n\r\nMany consider money and love as the two primary forces behind the demeanor of any person; the tangible and intangible reasons, if you will. It is unusual for these two forces to work together resulting in a ideal life for any person, and this is what Spice and Wolf primarily focuses on. Casting aside the aspects of the show that are based in fantasy, the conflict between the two is a very real struggle that Spice and Wolf explores. The relationship between Lawrence and Horo is far from ideal: it is tested in many ways, by adversaries that take many forms, and exhibits the fundamental concept of risk versus reward. It has been said that there can be only one great love in your life. The question is, is it the prospect of great fortune and the happiness that comes with it, or the fortune of a person that cannot be bought at any price? Spice and Wolf presents both sides of that coin.\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf's strength lies in the personality of the characters and the discussions about life, love, and profit between them. The merchants who act based on logical thinking and appraisal of facts; Spice and Wolf takes us into their world and shows us how a bit of cleverness and wit can go very far, and how any lack of information or foresight can cost someone more then they could ever imagine. \\n\\n\r\nLawrence and Horo make for an interesting combination to watch. On one hand, you have your wily traveling merchant who is a respectable man in his field and gets by making profit through calculations and predictions, and on the other, we have a wise wolf who has seen many a years pass and many a person met who is an expert at manipulating emotions and expectations. This duo, as expected, are able to use their talents to make a greater profit than your run of the mill peddler. However, as intelligent and cunning as they are, they are not perfect, and run into their fair share of troubles, and makes it that more interesting to watch. There is a lot to be said about a romantical relationship between a man and a deity; however their relationship does not follow the natural paradigm of such a situation. It is surprisingly ordinary, as each try to deal with their feelings for the other, and how they express their affections and emotions concerning the other. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is tastefully done and with accordance to the time period. From the well drawn towns that the two visit, to the scenery in the background while they are traveling; everything serves to enhance the atmosphere of a true adventure and the concept of traveling freely. The music is appropriate; ranging from lively violin pieces to somber folk songs, the tune more often than not fits the mood very nicely. Whether it's a relaxing scene in a pub where Horo and Lawrence are sharing a drink in high spirits, or it's a high tension situation between merchants, the music accompanies the scene appropriately.\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf weaves a tale of finance with hints of fantasy and romance in a endearing and intelligent way. For those who like a show to be stimulating, witty, and emotional, Spice and Wolf is an excellent choice.\\n",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf is a peaceful journey through a stylized, medieval Europe.  The story follows Lawerence Craft, a successful merchant, as he travels a winding path North to take his companion, the wolf-god, Holo, back to the home she has nearly forgotten.\r\nArt \u2013 7\r\nArtistically, Spice and Wolf succeeds in its panoramic intake of the various environments Lawerence and Holo travel throughout the series.  The show is very drenched in the authenticity of its time, from the rickety wagons to the stone inns.  The colors are mute wheats, somber blues, cloudy grays, and lots of brown, a palette that sets the show apartfrom most other series.  With that in mind however, the show becomes a bit of a bore when the focus is not on new sights, but on the bland character design, or even once the town of the moment has worn its welcome.  None of this is helped by the very stagnant sense of animation that contributes to a bit of Spice and Wolf\u2019s mustiness.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 8\\n\r\nAs with much of the natural, and researched feel of the art, a lot of the music helps contribute to the realism of the time period.  A score of wonderful strings and woodwinds greatly contribute to filling in the emotional backdrop of Spice and Wolf.  Music aside, the aural focus of the show is clearly in the performances of stars, Jun Fukuyama, and Ami Koshimizu.  In an almost traditional male/female comedy pairing, the two perform their roles with more charisma, wit, and depth in one episode than most casts manage to accumulate over a whole series.  For all intents and purpose they are the shining focus of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 8\\n\r\nSo, of course, because of the skilled performances of Fukuyama and Koshimizu, Lawerence Craft and Holo are brilliantly characterized solely because of the nature of their interactions.  With very little to go off of from the script\u2014Lawerence is a crafty merchant with lofty goals while being a bit inexperienced in meaningful human interactions; Holo, a wizened and free spirited wolf-god, has lived so long she can\u2019t manage to remember her roots\u2014the two are fully realized because of their relationship with one another.  This is enhanced by the clever and flirtatious dialogue use to dance circles around each other, the hallmark of Spice and Wolf.  That aside, every other character introduced seems wooden and unnecessary compared to the partnership of the leads. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 6\\n\r\nPerhaps the main weakness of the show is that the story is an uninspired adventure that is ultimately very forgettable.  Craft and Holo travel from town to town and encounter some sort of problem that, with high school level economics, they must scheme their way out of messes.   Insert a twist and a mysterious young girl for the sake of strengthening Holo and Lawerence\u2019s relationship, and you have the jist of the plot.  That said, I think the show was successful once in combining those elements to create an entertaining amount of tension. Beyond that, as a viewer, I tended to yearn more for the fantastic dialogue and a stronger sense of development in Holo and Lawerence\u2019s relationship than what was witnessed onscreen. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 7\\n\r\nThough the on-screen team of Lawerence and Holo is one of the best relationships this side of Banner of the Stars, it wasn\u2019t enough to carry a lot of the staleness of the overall production.  In conjunction with a heartily disappointing ending, the viewer is left either totally mystified by the luminous performance of Fukuyama and Koshimizu, or with a slightly bitter, \u201cThat was all?\u201d taste in their mouth.  My feelings are of the latter.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\\n",

            "content": "When watching this show I ponder on what it really means to \u201cFalling into the Hype\u201d.\r\nIt is na\u00efve to think that when a show is popular that it doesn\u2019t effect your mood going in. \r\nBut on that same thought is there a difference in \u201cFalling into the Hype\u201d and just seeking understatement on why something is popular. \r\nI didn\u2019t come into this show hyped but throughout this experience I was always search for that special something. \r\nSomething I never found. All I was left was this indifferent feeling. \r\nWhen you are stuck in an indifferent feeling is a good indication that the show is average.\r\nItis tasked upon you at that point to go through all the aspects of the show and see what would you say is above average and if that is enough to warrant putting up the score. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I asked about this show before I started watching my comrades noted there was a lot of mentioning of economics.\\n\r\nThat is definitely something that caught my attention and was the most enjoyable plot about the show.\\n\r\nI actually wrote a paper in college all about merchant guilds and having an anime that covered it was satisfying but only to a certain extent. \\n\r\nWe saw glimpses of the trade warfare going on but it wasn\u2019t a full-fledged dive into the economic wars of the world. \\n\r\nI would personally like to see a show about merchant guilds that would operate more like 91 Days. \\n\r\nThere was no individuality given to any of the guilds. \\n\\n\r\nThe merchant guilds were primarily there to only put hardships on our main character Lawrence. \\n\r\nA character that I have to say am disappointed in as he was fairly bland the entire entry. \\n\r\nThere were glimpses at the end that showed he could improve in the second season. But he needs to drop the White Knight act. \\n\r\nThen even as a businessman I can\u2019t respect him as I don\u2019t know who in their right mind would put all their money in one basket instead of building up a contingency. \\n\r\nThere is no time in this show where I can definitively say I felt bad for him.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Holo calls this guy a loser. She isn\u2019t wrong.\\n\r\nHolo is the best character of the show by default but still isn\u2019t exactly my type of girl.\\n\r\nI have seen a lot of individuals deeming Lawrence and Holo to be one of the best couples in all of anime.\\n\r\nYet the romance in this season has barely even been scratched. I would hope in the second season there would be much improvement. \\n\r\nBut as for the first season we\u2019ve only seen Tsundere flirting. That is nowhere near enough for me. \\n\\n\r\nThen we move on the supernatural element of the show. \\n\r\nI really liked the opening the show and the world it was attempting to create in episode 1 about Holo\u2019s origins.\\n\r\nBut all of that was downgraded to a side story and an unfulfilling one at that. \\n\r\nThere was all this talk about the people believing they didn\u2019t need Holo anymore to bless their crops.\\n\r\nBut because of everything else going on in the show the climax to that just fell flat. \\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t even put that into the importance of the currency wars that was noted throughout the season. \\n\r\nHaving rivaling currencies was very intriguing aspect to follow.\\n\r\nBut when the economics changed over to just being there for hardships on Lawrence we lost that flare there as well. \\n\\n\r\nWhat it comes down to is can I say that anything about this show was fulfilling? The answer would be no. \\n\r\nThe OP and ED are good but nothing I would put in my top 20. \\n\r\nThe Art is good but nothing I\u2019d rave about. \\n\r\nI\u2019m giving those 8 out of 10 but there is nothing amazing there for me to want to bump up the score. \\n\r\nI will also note that I felt the pacing was rushed for the plot. There was also time for more plot that was taken up by slice of life episodes. \\n\r\nFinally I do find it ironic that even in the moment of writing this review. My feeling on this review of the show reflects my opinions on show. Indifferent. \\n",

            "content": "Ookami To Koushinryou, also known as Spice And Wolf. Medieval culture, medieval economy, medieval legends, and a wolf, this is what Spice And Wolf is all about. An immortal wolf. An adorable, funny, sad, Wise wolf who loves apples and who loves to tease her companion. You will hardly forget of such wolf, and the more you'll know about her, the more you'll want to know about her.\r\nStory: 9\r\nI rated the story of this series 9 but... There is actually no story. The plot is about a medieval merchant, Craft Lawrence, who one night stumbles upon Holo The Wise Wolf. She seems to be anormal girl, despite having a \"Wonderful Tail\" and wolf years on her head, but she's actually a kind of goddess. Her will is to return to her homeland, to the north, and Lawrence is supposed to fulfill her wish. That's it, as far as the plot only is concerned.\\n\r\nWhat happens in the episodes then, you ask? In each and every episode we'll have Lawrence simply making his job. He's a travelling merchant, so he travels from town to town trying to make convenient deals and make profit. Be prepared to see a lot of PURE medieval economics. \\n\r\nSo the \"Story\" if you want to call it like that, is divided in two big parts: the first one is the economics one, in which we simply follow Lawrence's deals; the second one is the relationship between the two protagonists, and that's the main event of the whole anime. But I will get to that later.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI'm not a huge expert as far as Art is concerned, but I can say that I liked pretty much everything in the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe opening, Tabi No Tochuu, is by far the best one I've ever heard so far. The 1 minute and 20 seconds edit we hear in the show gives even more pathos than the original song, in my opinion, because such beginning with a soft piano and the beautiful voice of the then 18-year-old Kiyoura Natsumi is magical, mysterious and extraordinarily fitting with the atmosphere of the anime. I was literally chilled the first time I heard it and for the first time I was actually sad that an anime opening ended so fast. The ending is just funny.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the anime itself is very very nice and it perfectly fits with the medieval setting of the show. There are no particular tracks to quote, but all of them are good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nHere we go. This is the real reason why Spice And Wolf should be a MUST. As I said before, one whole half of the story focuses on the relationship of the two main characters Lawrence and Holo. \\n\r\nLawrence is just a merchant. He's not any kind of \"The Best Merchant Of The Lands!\" or \"A merchant of incomparable ability!\" or some other epic guy who's gonna take over the world with his trades. No. He's a simple travelling merchant who simply does his job and lives like that. His job requires ability and luck as well. So if he's not good enough or lucky enough, he's gonna pay for that, and you WILL actually see him in desperate conditions, during the show.\\n\r\nHe's an open person, who enjoys talking, exchanging information, he's quite the solar guy. He's just a little slow with women, which makes his relationship with Holo way more awkward than it should be, sometimes, and quite funny other times. His best quality, though, is his generosity. He doesn't turn down Holo's request of taking her back to the north, and he's even ready to put aside his own future goals for her sake. \\n\\n\r\nBut the shining gem of this show is Holo. She is, so far, the best character I've ever seen in anime, and with no doubts my favorite one. What about her? \\n\r\nAs I said, she's some sort of Wolf-Goddess, but she introduces herself as \"Just Holo, nothing more, nothing less\". During the show we will see almost every kind of her personality. We will happen to see a teasing Holo, a drunk Holo, an apple-loving Holo, a funny Holo, an angry Holo or even a heartbreaking sad Holo. We will be surprised of how much human a WOLF-GODDESS is. We will notice how her immortality is an actual burden to her, and how sometimes she genuinely wishes to be mortal. The depth of this character will catch you in every possible way and as I said in the very beginning: the more you'll know about Holo, the more you'll WANT to know about her. There can be no filler episodes in Spice And Wolf, because whatever we know more about Holo, that's like gold to us.\\n\r\nI'll just make an example and share my own thought about Holo. There is a saying, that \"People die only when they are forgotten\". Holo is immortal, so in other words, she can't die. On the other hand, all the people she's met in her life were all mortals, and soon or later, they all died. But since Holo is alive and has memories of all of them, they still \"aren't dead\", as we refer to that saying... But is Holo really alive, having nobody to remember HER? The beautiful, cruel and very delicate contrast in this is that Holo, in some ways, isn't actually immortal, but she grants immortality to everyone she meets. She's really alive only for small periods of her life, and Spice And Wolf is set during one of them, while she's making room in Lawrence's memories.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThis rating is an average of two other ratings, one for each half of the show. I rated 8 all the economics parts, since even though I didn't really understand everything, it was quite interesting to see how things worked back then, what is actually a travelling merchant and so on. I won't give more than 8 because I have to say it, in certain moments I really got bored and was tempted to skip parts of the episodes, which I fortunately didn't.\\n\r\nThe other half, the relationship between the two protagonists, gets a 10/10 hands down. It's natural, you actually feel like you're with them, their third companion, and you are actually able to share their thoughts and feelings. I really loved to see how the two behaved during difficult or critical situations, as well as their psychological development. You'll always want to see more from them, even about their most stupid or less important aspects, such as drunk Holo.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThe show itself is awesome, and I really really loved it. It isn't a full 10/10 simply because of the whole economics half which is great, but if someone isn't specifically into it, it's hard to follow and it might lower the expectations of the show. So you should better avoid it if you aren't ready for a lot of talking about hard stuff. But if you love well-made romance, with really awesome characters, then I'm sure that all of the economics won't be a huge burden to bear.",

This girl is Holo,who sees no purpose in helping the town with its harvest,since they now have the expertise to care for the crops themselves. She wishes to go to herhome in the North,and has chosen Lawrence to be the one that takes her there.\\n\\n\r\nAnd,that's it. The series is essentially their journey through the land,and all the interesting characters they meet along the way. Like I said,not a story heavy show,but that's not what makes it enjoyable. It's more about the characters than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf is a gorgeous show to look at. All the characters have wonderful facial animations,the backgrounds are perfect,and the designs are nice. Why give it a 9? Well...there's the occasional instance of \"Not showing legs while walking to save animation money\" which is very noticeable,but not a deal breaker.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf's soundtrack is a pleasure to the ears. It fits the setting of middle age Europe that the show is going for,and knows exactly how to set the mood.\\n\\n\r\nAlso in the case of sound is the voice acting,I watched it dubbed (Please don't kill me.) and it sounded great,there was never a character that sounded \"off\" at any point.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what carry this show.\\n\\n\r\nHolo and Lawrence have some of the best chemistry I've seen in a show. They FEEL like real people. The acting,writing,animation culminates together to form these wonderful characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe people they meet are also very interesting. You'll find yourself incredibly interested in a new character's issues and problems,and actually care about what happens to them,even though you only see them for a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:9/10\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf is a show in which the rather weak story is made up for the characters and the art and music. I'd recommend this to anyone who just wants to take a breath,relax,and see your favorite characters get out of their new predicament.\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nOne of the strangest feelings that people often experience is yearning. Wanting to see one more time your late mother, hoping to get that perfect job, wishing to experience what the world has to offer; everyone has dreams and aspirations. And what's amazing is that they come in all shapes and sizes. Spice and Wolf Season One is a story filled with such yearning, yearning for money, for home, and especially for each other, and is a wonderful beginning to a memorable tale.\r\nSTORY\r\nS&W1 stars Lawrence, a traveling merchant who, one night, comes upon a wolf-girl named Holo. Shedreams of visiting her homeland in the north. Helping each other along the way, Lawrence and Holo begin their journey to the snowy land.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you talk about anime, Spice and Wolf is always brought up. And along with its mention is the talk about economics. After viewing the first season myself, they were certainly right. Something that the show does well is its take on the financial side of dealings and what it all entails. Meaning, besides just showing off gold and silver coins, the show takes considerable time to explain the money deals involved to not only provide interesting schemes but to also demonstrate the rougher side of the business. Lawrence and Holo are good at what they do, and for the most part, they succeed. However, the difficulties encountered are realistic and trying. \"Trying\" in this case means affecting both their wallets and their mental fortitude.\\n\\n\r\nIn tandem with the economics, season one also establishes the relationship between Lawrence and Holo. Being a \"Romance\" anime, such a development should be mandatory. Thankfully, it is handled quite well. Their personalities, despite being completely different, work nicely in unison. They understand each other on a deeper level, often resorting to teasing and jokes (some of which can go too far!), which further helps to showcase how close the two become. Being the first season, it's understandable that huge progress isn't made. But it is clear from their interactions and the dynamic they share that they truly care for one another beyond just peddler and dog.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at it a bit more analytically, season one is an expression of what it means to trust another person. Trust is fickle, so its worth is entirely dependent on the person it is given to. As such, Lawrence especially, but Holo as well, gets to experience its many convoluted sides. The types of trust dealt with include: earning it, having it betrayed, losing it, finding it, using it, and most important of all, knowing that it is there already. The latter is heavily tied in with Lawrence's and Holo's relationship, and plays large roles throughout the season. By nature, \"trust is earned and not given.\" And by the end of the season, this idea is firmly brought to light.\\n\\n\r\nChanneling even more of my inner \"wise wolf,\" the show also takes a rather interesting stab at a very touchy topic: religion. The outside force usually at work in S&W1 is the church. They bring the taxes, require donations, and oversee their town's item handling. While they may seem honest and trustworthy on the outside, their word is law. A lot of the trouble our duo encounters is in some way related to the house of God. Perhaps ironically, the solutions to such problems are always aided by a God, Holo. In this way, the first season is more or less a \"battle of the Gods.\" This idea can be interpreted in quite a few ways: God is \"wrong,\" having differing beliefs is entirely correct, etc. While I don't think that S&W's true aim was something so deep as insinuating religious doubt, I think there is enough evidence at play to believe that this train of thought is not out of the question.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nI think the best way to put it when it comes to the art style for S&W is \"right for all the wrong reasons.\" The show takes place in what I would call a 1500's (give or take a few hundred) era. In this time period, coins are king, market trading is prevalent, and the church has its hands in all aspects of life. As such, the towns our couple visit are filled with people, the bustling of trading, and the clamoring of carts as they move down the road. The atmosphere provided fits very well with the art itself; the houses appear \"old-time-y\" and the clothes are appropriate. I say \"wrong reasons\" for everything because the show's old looking vibe doesn't really fit the time it was made. In other words, it looks older than when it was produced, but that actually helps itself out.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of actual animation, S&W is actually about average. The show is heavy on the dialogue and for good reason. As such, there is a lot of sitting in taverns, riding on carts, and resting on beds. So for the most part, there is no character movement. However, there are things such as Lawrence's mannerisms and Holo's ears and tails that do see animation from time to time, but they are pretty natural so they never really stand out.\\n\\n\r\nOne final note, I loved Holo's character design. Both of her outfits, her eyes, her facial expressions, her smile; it just screams \"Holo\" for some strange reason.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThis is a story about Mr. Spice and Mrs. Wolf. So, while there is usually one important side character for the about three arcs in this first season, the main focus is understandably on Lawrence and Holo.\\n\\n\r\nLawrence is a peddler by day and a business man by night. Smart, thoughtful, and good-natured (as Holo would have you know), he is a man who stays true to his convictions and the contracts that he establishes. Early on, he cares mostly about how to profit from the situations that he is in. But as time passes being with Holo, it becomes less about the gains and more about not losing what he already has. He is defined by his unrelenting will to see a \"job\" all the way through, and his ease of handling Holo in all situations is a testament to his understanding of her.\\n\\n\r\nNow to perhaps what many of you have been wading through to read! Holo, or to many, many people, \"best girl,\" is in actuality a wolf-god of harvest. She is extremely playful, terribly prideful, and downright powerful when she needs to be. She adores teasing Lawrence whenever she gets the chance and both hates and loves to be pampered by him. As she describes herself, she is wise when it comes to dealing with decisions and with people. On top of all of this, she is incredibly cute, very pretty, and has a good sense of humor.\\n\\n\r\nFor Holo, one of her most important defining characteristics is also one of the most human. That is her feeling of loneliness. Being a God, she was used to having \"company,\" people believing in her. But when peoples' faith began to waver, the only one who would stretch out his/her hand was Lawrence. Holo absolutely despises being left alone, especially being away from Lawrence. Now, one could argue that this behavior is precisely because he is the only one to have given her any attention. However, this isn't the case at all due to the many different ways in which they help one another over the course of the first half of their journey. From Lawrence protecting Holo's robe to Holo guarding Lawrence until the right people arrived, their commitment towards one another goes beyond simple travel companions.\\n\\n\r\nAs I've said already, this is the first \"season,\" so I'm being a bit more lenient. The characters have been introduced, characterized, and given at least some direction. Next season I do expect more growth from them both, both individually and between the two of them, but for what was presented, it was definitely done well.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP for S&W1 is, in one word, beautiful. It starts off serene and eerie, but the halfway point introduces the male singer in conjunction with the female singer, and their voices work in harmony with the country guitar and drums to provide a stunning arrangement. And the final note from the vocalist is strong and emotional. Coupled with the visuals, it is wonderfully crafted.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED has become one of my favorites. Like Holo herself, it's quite playful, fun, and joyful. Also quite unique to it is that it's the only all-English lyrics for a song in an anime that I've heard. At this point, I've listened to it enough times to know the lyrics, and now often find myself \"whistling around the world.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also quite good. Two of my favorite pieces are the ocarina/flute playing that accompanies Holo or Lawrence teasing one another and the other is the guitar piece that usually plays during the explanations of the schemes or plans ahead.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting-wise, there were no stand-out performances. However, Lawrence's and Holo's voices match their characters perfectly, which are probably the most important to have down pat.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf is notorious for two things: economics and the main couple.\\n\\n\r\nFor the former, I actually found myself re-watching many of the explanations so I could understand everything exactly as it was meant to be understood. This was me really wanting to get what they were talking about because I enjoyed the conversations about silver Trenni coins, buying armor on credit, and using indirect means to lower prices.\\n\\n\r\nThe latter is something I cherish in all anime, no matter how small. While the romance between Lawrence and Holo isn't at the forefront, it is definitely there amid the playfulness, the conversations, and the way they act towards one another. As a viewer, you know it is on each of their minds during certain segments, so when it isn't directly stated or when it is skirted around, it is frustrating but in the teasing, good way.\\n\\n\r\nMany shows need time to fully create the world they want to present, flesh out the characters they want to show, and craft the narrative they wish to tell. For Spice and Wolf Season One, they created a very strong stepping stone that gives the second season a big head start.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, money, love, trust, and religion\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, art style somehow works but animation is average\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, Holo really is best girl\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, among the best OPs and EDs, good soundtrack, fine VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, scales are accurately balanced between economics and romance\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf is a wonderful tale that about the relationship and adventures of a merchant and a wolf-goddess. It is very well written, set in a very interesting time-period, and has great meaning to it. The story is a good one, with just the right twists and turns, and all the right developments a story needs to turn into something you will enjoy or at least be slightly intrigued by.\r\nStory 10/10- The story is one you have heard of several times,perhaps even in your bedtime stories. A normal person meeting a wolf-girl. But this story is different from most stories told like this, andits original. The story goes into great depth about everything. The world and how it works, the characters and thier feelings, the people around them, how they live, and human and (in this case) wolf behavior. And in terms of human behavior and wolf behavior, i mean how,where,when, and why people and wolves do the things they do and how they are different.\\n\\n\r\nThe story does have some action in it, but not too much or to little. Just enough to keep everything going. Don''t expect lots of sword-slashing or lots and lots of blood like Bleach or Death Note, but you can expect that the characters will be endangered by outside forces....or possibly worse. It also has adventure, though like i said, not a lot of fighting or anything. Later in the story, you can see a little romance, not any of lovey-dovey stuff, but it is hinted every so often so you know somethings going on, but not enough so that it annoys you. For the most part, it is a pretty realistic story, except for the wolf-girl factor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Art for the Series is AWESOME. You can see almost every detail about everything single thing. Their are also a lot of colors for everything, so nothing will look dull and you'll never get bored. It is truly beautiful. And it is done is such a way so that it looks great, but doesn't try and stand out too much. This is important because if you like the setting and background for the world, the world becomes a lot more believable and then so do the characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound was also done very nicely. Everything from the sound of a carthorse trotting by, to a bird twittering, to the sound of Holo howling in the moonlight, is realistic and sounds great. The music for the series was also done very nicely, with perfect themes for all the characters and for all the different situations and feelings that arise. The OP theme sung by Natsumi Kiyoura is a perfect way to start the series, starting nice and slow and ending with a great emotional climax which leaves you wanting to know what happens next. The ED theme done by ROCKY CHACK, was also good. I personally didn't think it was the best, but it was  pretty good all the same. Overall, the sound and music for Spice and Wolf was AWESOME.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters for Spice and Wolf are GREAT. Even the side-characters are all likable in some way or another. Holo is the one that stands out mostly for this series. She is in no way weak in any way. She is Strong, Wise, Crafty, and Amusing all at the same time. She can be happy one second and then angry another, she is cunning at in both words and action, and she is very smart when it comes to things such as Craft Laurence's business and the ways people's minds work. She also shows great development in the beginning and throughout  the story. She is overall a great character who's original, fun and interesting to watch, and nice to relate to.\\n\\n\r\nBut that doesn't mean she's the only reason why you should watch this. Craft Lawrence, the merchant in the story, is also a great character in many ways. Most male characters in these types of stories do not often have much spot-light or they do not develop well enough. Craft Lawrence is a exception ( I also like Tomoya Okazaki from Clannad). He is done just about as well as Holo. He is very smart when i comes to business,people, and what they are thinking and doing (almost as well as Holo,making him pretty smart). He is also very considerate to others, helping Holo with her woe's and concerns and vice-versa. Of course, his character also develops more as the story goes, in a way that keeps you interested, and after a while, lets you accept the character (and vice-versa with Holo). He is an original character and an interesting character as well, and as a person i would like to meet if i had the chance(Same with Holo).\\n\\n\r\nThat is the thing that really keeps this series going. The relationship between Craft Lawrence and Holo. It is interesting most of the time, and funny at others. It is indeed unique, and one that grows over time, so that they become more and more dependent on each other. Their relationship starts out simple and slow, but quickly turns into a close friendship...maybe even more. It is one that does not drag itself or push itself too much. It is a wonderful thing, with both pros and cons. One with many different circumstances to test thier bond between them, some that even change thier choices and disitions(sorry if i spelled that wrong)), and possibly almost break their bond( this is actually more prominent in the second season). Both have everything to lose and everything to gain.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters also contribute to the story well. They do not drag the story down in any way, and sometimes even make the story more interesting or funny to watch. Most of them are actually important at times, unlike a lot of side-characters in stories.Some might even leave the same impact on you that Craft or Holo might leave. Overall, every character is worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\n- So far, i have enjoyed Spice and Wolf very very much. Everything about it fascinates me, including the Renaissance-Europe setting, which for some reason is a time in history i've been fascinated with for a long time. I enjoy watching Craft and Holo's relationship grow, along with the many conflicts that come their way and they conquer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall- This is a great anime(it is originally a bunch of light-novels, and now a manga, and its on-going), and i look forward to watching the second season very soon and eventually more.  I highly recommend it to anyone who's interested in this genre or just wants to watch an anime thats original...or just to anyone who's interested.Just to let you know, the series does have a dub, and its GREAT. Unlike most dubs,each voice for each character fits perfectly and does not ruin the anime. Even if your someone who only watches subs, try it out. You will not be dissapointed.",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf is a curious little piece of fictional work because it makes you think and that's not something one would expect from a romance themed series. It touches upon a wide variety of topics - currency, business, animism and even the attitudes and base, primal, desires of human beings. Moreover it does so with surprising grace. Not once did I think that the plot presented here was superficial or lacking in substance. That said however, Spice and Wolf is not a masterpiece as there are a few blemishes on its otherwise well thought-out plot. \r\nIn short, the story follows a young man namedKraft Lawrence on his adventures throughout the medieval world as he moves from village to village selling various goods to people. One day, while out and about he discovers Holo - a wolf-like deity in human form (this here would be the animist part). They decide to form a bond based on a number of conditions (which I shall omit from this review to keep it spoiler free) and set out across the medieval land to barter their way to fortune... and eat apples.\\n\\n\r\nYou see for all its intellectual rambling, picturesque locations and deep drama, Spice and Wolf still maintains a healthy balance and manages to squeeze some comedic moments in which is something that I enjoyed tremendously in this anime. Despite of all these strengths however I feel that the story is ironically the weakest component of Spice and Wolf and that's merely down to a single flaw - the romance. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not that it's not there, oh it is there. But no, the problem is that it is way too intellectual and based upon witty exchanges that the male lead and his female companion throw at each other, a bit like in Bakemonogatari. It's not even that it's not earnest as it seemed genuine for most part but the problem is that you can't invest yourself emotionally in this type of romance. While you're trying to project yourself into their situation or feel for them, they're discussing the purity of a silver coin, inflation, role of the church in feudal systems etc. (btw, this is how they show affection for each other, for the most part) and so your brain is completely engaged on an intellectual level while your limbic system is screaming to get a piece of the action - which never happens.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, there were a few emotionally exclusive moments where my lizard brain became partially aroused (Especially in the second half of the show) but it was majorly let down as there was much more room for passion without making the story seem trite. As such the romance is very tame, sheepish... immature even. Very much reminiscent of the relationship between Keiichi and Belldandy from Ah! My Goddess. \\n\\n\r\nDespite these few shortcomings however, I still thoroughly enjoyed the story and consider Spice and Wolf to be an interesting and most importantly - novel experience. I have watched quite a few romance themed animes, but I must say that this would be the first time where so many intriguing topics have been combined together so well. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the visual and auditory aspect of Spice and Wolf is something else altogether. I'm a sucker for classical music or music that even vaguely resembles something that might have been made by a classical composer. Spice and Wolf delivers majorly. The OST made me want to strap on conquistador armour, hop on a boat and sail through the Atlantic to re-enact the battle at Tenochtitlan.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are fairly good, but not flawless. Characters might look a little bit odd in distance shots but I never place that much importance upon it because such is the case with most anime series. The designs on the other hand is where Spice and Wolf's visual strengths lie. Each character is unique and not just because of different hair colour. The environment looks stunning and the way the wheat fields are animated in this anime is sure to pleasure the eyes of even the most scrupulous connoisseurs.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, Spice and Wolf is a must watch for any business management undergraduate, and a recommended watch for the average anime watcher. The main and really only problem was that the romance here was lackluster in the way that you couldn't really FEEL it. It was certainly there (with plenty of flirting to boot) but not once did it engage me on an emotional level and as such every episode feels like you're watching a married couple give you a sleep-inducing lecture on economics and micromanagement. That however should not keep you, the reader, from watching Spice and Wolf ( or re-watching if you've seen it already) as it has plenty to offer. It is, all in all, a very good anime.\\n\\n\r\nA solid 8 points.",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf is an impressively charming tale of politics, economics, and romance. However, that was not the reason I watched it. It was recommended to me for its characters. To be more specific, the main reason I watched Spice and Wolf now is because Holo was Sudostef\u2019s (my favorite internet personality, RIP) number 1 favorite character. Given that he placed Holo above Asuka was a really, really big deal. I have Asuka as my number 1 and can\u2019t really imagine a character topping her. Anyways, onto actually talking about Spice and Wolf. \r\nSpice and Wolf is a breathtakingly beautiful anime. The art style, characterdesigns, backgrounds, and directing style are all done extremely well in a manner that really appealed to me. Spice and Wolf is surprisingly high quality. \\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf\u2019s world setting and world building are absolutely spectacular. The world feels like something straight out of a documentary; it is astoundingly rich with realism. It does a superb job at selling its complex, politically and economically driven plot. Spice and Wolf does this so well that it feels like it overshadows the underlying romance / character development. To me, this is a bad thing considering I came into Spice and Wolf looking to be blown away with character development. \\n\\n\r\nHolo, so far, seems like a pretty good character, but as of right now I don\u2019t think she even breaks my top 20. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the things she represents are very deep and hit home for me, but it is just not developed enough at this point. I\u2019m hoping that this first season serves primarily to just place a setting for more character development to happen in the second season. The rest of the characters feel real enough and are good on their own accord. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m rating Spice and Wolf with the assumption that its themes on introspection and loneliness are portrayed with purpose and with the intent to develop them further in the second season. If those themes are not actually in place here, I will reconsider my rating. For now, I\u2019m giving Spice and Wolf a \u2018Good\u2019 score. There are much better political anime out there. There are much better romance anime out there. There are much better character driven psychological anime out there. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve seen an economics based anime out there so this might very well be the best one, but that is irrelevant to me. \\n\\n\r\nMy Recommendation: \\n\r\nSpice and Wolf\u2019s first season is worth a watch. It is average to above average in every way, but not spectacular at anything other than economics. Once I watch the second season I will come back and say if this is a must watch as a prelude to that, but for now I can say that it is somewhat skippable despite my \u2018Good\u2019 rating. \\n",

            "content": "This is a somewhat spoiler review which I will mention when I get to the section, so my short, spoiler-free opinion is that, if you want to see a well-written female character, not just in anime but in every type of visual medium, try it.\r\nBy far the best thing about this anime is Holo the wise wolf. In fact, I enjoyed the character so much I had to coin a new name: a 4-D tsundere. Her character and aura revolves around mischievousness--and it's genuinely exciting to watch. Why? because, even as a watcher, sometimes you don't actually know if she has an ulterior motive oran underhanded meaning behind what she says or does. For example, it may SEEM ironic at first how she calls herself \"wise\" despite falling into human tropes like jealousy and sensitivity yet the way she immediately presents herself as so self aware of this interactions makes you rethink whether if she is actually falling for them. The way she initiates romance with may SEEM typical-tsundere-esque, but it's unique in that she still comes off confident with no self-defeat which presents her as not just adorable, but admirable. To parallel a merchant's dialogue, it seemed as if she's always getting the \"better deal\" and I couldn't help but me amused.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of Holo's sheer presence, Lawrence is the complementary character, but not forgettable. They both outwit each other, teach each other, and i'ts not always about \"do you like me or not\" dialogue. This made me feel that there was a genuine friendship there as opposed to their wagon being the slowwww vehicle that would end in romantic love. A golden example of their dialogue is this:\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER BEGIN\\n\\n\r\n\"you listen. There are times when you want to hear something even it's a lie. There are times when you feel like hitting the person until his face swells up if he takes too long to say it. which do you think it is now?...from now on, please be upset. I appreciate you being considerate, but sometimes, problems can be solved quicker if we both get upset and argue...[from episode 11]\"\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER END\\n\\n\r\nYou can see why I'd call her \"4-D.\" She is cleverly being meta but not just for the sake of it--it makes sense in the story and doesn't betray her character.\\n\r\nI can only appreciate that she is calling out not only Lawrence, but also basically every shounen/shoujo conflict out there. People can't read each other's minds. So why not blow off some steam and move on? At the end, both will understand each other better. Not only is this a mature dialogue, this exemplifies how Lawrence and Holo treat each other: respect and no bullshit. From now on, when someone asks me what is a \"true feminist?\" I will think of Holo.\\n\r\nBe it a romantic or plot issue, it's almost as if Holo embodied a harsh studio editor who would say \"This conflict is dragging the pace. let's chop chop chop and move on.\"  \\n\\n\r\nInteraction with Lawrence certainly brings out heavy dialogue, to which I disagree with it being \"boring.\" This ultimately lies in personal taste and age of the viewer so I can't \"argue\" why the dialogue matters, but imo, I just found it enjoyable and logical that he would explain his thought process which stem from the culture of a merchant's life. Even though some were shoehorned in, I found most of the virtues that he admires to which he believes to be a pivotal part of merchant identity make sense. The point is, it's clear that whoever was responsible for this world building actually cared about what mattered at that time and I appreciate that dedication.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER BEGIN\\n\\n\r\nA problem I had with the plot was its repetitiveness--specially, betrayal being the only MAIN driving factor that moved the story. Because betrayal is such an easily predictable problem in the business world, I was bored and kinda rolling my eyes. While Lawerence seemed to be a master at his craft in the beginning, being a victim to this trap repetitively made him seem like an optimistic fool, which albeit he admits, but doesn't justify that he seems awfully naive in a world that clearly portrays this merchant cultures as quite dubious. By the conclusion, It just seemed like he didn't actually learn much from his experience but was more conveniently saved by his mischievous companion and friends. This doesn't champion the idea of \"may good be rewarded\" either. I personally think there were plenty of other areas they could've used to move the plot such as delving more into the stereotypes about women in that time, confrontation with the Church's values, his relationship with Chloe or perhaps with his family, more about Holo's past ( seriously,...). I understand these were all mentioned but not nearly as I'd hoped. In all major conflicts, betrayal was clearly the poster boy and I found it boring.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER END\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack was forgettable, but understandably I guess. I do love the OP though.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the show itself was its own worst enemy because other characters and the world building just didn't' seem as good compared to Holo who I thought was truly impressive. I want to give sincere praise to whoever designed this character because this is a feat that other entertainment industries have a hard time executing as well.",

The people who watched the show were praising the crap out of it. So I was expecting at least a watchable show. When I sat down to fully watch it, I was amazed how attached I was to the show. It got me like a tornado and attached like glue. This show just knew what genres I loved, mainly romance, drama, and fantasy and made them even better then the average show.Even though I love the genres that Spice and Wolf present to us, it can still be watched by any gender and fans of any genre out there. I've seen males watch this and love it and basically anyone out there. I haven't found a single person who didn't at least like one aspect of this. I think the main reason people got caught in the tornado like me is the character, Holo. I'll talk about her more in depth as the review goes on, but here's my rant of why people love her for now. Holo just adds this, I guess you could say, \"flavor\" to the show. What I mean by this is she gives the audience some smiles and laughs, and when the heavy stuff hits and she changes from what she usually is, we feel for her as she tries to cope with it. She was defiantly a great character and one of the best parts of this anime. Well, that's my mini rant, let's get to the calming, charming, and beautiful world of Spice and Wolf.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nPlot Description:\\n\\n\r\n\"Kraft Lawrence, a traveling merchant searching for profit, finds a naked girl with the ears and tail of a wolf asleep in his cart. Her name is Holo \u2013 a harvest goddess with an untamed beast lurking inside who longs to return to her beloved northern home. Armed with his street smarts and her animal instincts, a simple peddler and a forgotten deity begin a journey through the wild countryside. Along their path, the riches of happiness shall be reaped, even as the bankruptcy which dwells in the human heart is exposed.\"-MyAnimeList plot description\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\nThis show just loves to switch from comical to emotional, and it really works. You just get sucked into the dilemmas the characters have to get through and the fights they have to win. Take example the relationship of Holo and Lawrence, it's not just one of those, \"Everything will always work out\" types of relationships. You actually get a flip between the two and it makes it so much more real. That's probably why so many people love Spice and Wolf, it feels so much more real then most anime tend to be. It gave me unexplained and happy attachment towards the show itself. I bet that's what a lot of people have towards this show. I just love those shows that can flip between emotional and comical and not feel forced. I feel that's one of the strong points that anyone going into Spice and Wolf can feel.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\nMy major con with the story is that I don't really give two craps about the economics the show keeps bringing up. It really got on my nerves and what gave the story an eight. There was like this one episode were they were trying to rescue one of the characters and gave this really boring exposition for like half the episode. I was basically half asleep during that whole thing. That's not a feeling I want from a show, I want an exciting feeling and not a boring one. \\n\\n\r\nMy other con is the ending to the first season. Yes, I know that there's a second season that I'll get around to reviewing one day, but I felt it was a bit too average for Spice and Wolf standards, and leaves a lot of things unanswered for the time. Like, \"Did they ever find Yoitsu?\" or \"What happens to Holo and Lawrence?\"\\n\\n\r\nMy last con is the story can get a bit slow for people who don't want to feel bored. It's not fast paced and quick visual kind of show, it's more like one of those, \"Just wanna sit down and watch TV and have some snacks after a long day of work/school.\" types of feelings. Nothing too crazy or exciting, just normal and calming in a good way. So don't go into this anime expecting something, \"Oh my gosh, that was amazing dude!\" worthy. Instead expect, \"That was a really sweet moment. I really love the main duo.\"\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 9/10\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I really loved the backgrounds of the show. They felt very lively and fit the show so perfectly. It really did feel like they were in a very calming environment the show presented to us. They put a lot of detail into those that I just wanted to be in the world Holo and Lawrence were in. I don't really have much to say in this department.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs to me are simple but effective. They're very recognizable out of context and fit the show 100%. They give the character's very unique and distinguishable features that stands out instead of the same character but different hair and eye color. Holo has her long and graceful hair with wolf ears and a soft and long tail. Lawrence has his down-to-earth look to him. So plus in that type of place.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation can get a little slow at times. Like they'll have a character talk and they'll only have their mouth move. Sometimes they have an expression on their face to go along with it. So they'll cut corners by moving the camera different angles. This is only sometimes so it's not really a major con. I don't really have a lot of cons in this part.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, thank you Funimation for this wonderful dub. When I listen to the dub, I feel as though these are actual characters talking and not actors talking behind a microphone. The dub gave Holo her own flair and fit her character so well. Brina Palecia, great job on making the character your own instead trying to imitate the Japanese Holo. We don't stop there, we get J. Michael Tatum as Lawrence. Of course he'd play the part well, he played Okabe from Steins;Gate and Scar from FMA. If you don't want to read a bunch of subtitles, please check out the dub.\\n\\n\r\nAnother pro is the beautiful opening. They could have gone with a J-Pop band, but nope, they gave us a beautiful song with great vocals and calming instrumentals. It fit the calm universe of the show super well. I could listen to this opening all day and never get tired of it. It's one of those openings to listen to if you just want to kick back and relax. I just love those types of openings that you can just listen to and not skip past it.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is recognizable but not a certain track I'd like to point out. That really sucks because this show has a lot to like about it's sound. I would like to just listen to just one part of the soundtrack on it's own. That's really all I have to say about this part.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nLawrence:\\n\\n\r\n\"Kraft Lawrence, who chiefly goes by his surname, is a twenty-five-year-old traveling peddler who goes from town to town buying and selling various things in order to make a living. When he was twelve, he became an apprentice to a merchant relative, and set out on his own at eighteen. His goal in life is to gather enough money to start his own shop, and he has already been traveling for seven years while gaining experience in the trade. He meets Holo one night and eventually agrees to her traveling with him. She helps him by providing her wisdom which helps to increase his profits and get him out of jams.\\n\\n\r\nLawrence usually goes by his surname, only some who have known him for a long time, like Jakob Tarantino, the master of his guild, call him by his first name Kraft in the novel.\"-MyAnimeList character description\\n\\n\r\nWords I'd use to describe Lawrence is down-to-earth and very calm. He's the voice of reason to a conflict that arises when him and Holo are traveling. He's not the most energetic and lively, but does get very happy whenever him and Holo are together. If he didn't have Holo around to spice up his life, he'd probably just be a very average type of traveler. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I like the most about Lawrence is the development he get's throughout the story. He starts out as just an average traveler just going from place to place. When he then meets Holo, he starts to be lively and protective around her. He will protect the ones he loves and if not, he does get depressed. It's just a ton of fun to see him interact to Holo. They sometimes get in a fight, but not a huge cat fight, just more playful. These two make a good duo and couple, I'm glad he was in this story because he does add his own \"flavor\" to it.\\n\\n\r\nHolo:\\n\\n\r\n\"Holo is a wolf harvest deity originally from a land in the north known as Yoitsu. She made a promise with men from a town called Pasloe where she would ensure the town would have good wheat harvests year after year. However, as time went on, the townspeople slowly started to forsake Holo and did not rely on her as they once did. As such, Holo escapes from town in Lawrence's wagon and started traveling with him to see how much the world has changed since she has been in Pasloe. Holo has chosen the form of a girl younger than Lawrence, though she still retains her large white-tipped wolf tail, and ears. Her true form is that of a very large wolf which many people revered and feared.\\n\\n\r\nShe refers to herself as the \"Wise Wolf of Yoitsu\" (\u30e8\u30a4\u30c4\u306e\u8ce2\u72fc). She is typically very haughty and self-sufficient, though due to her isolation for hundreds of years in Pasloe, she gradually feels very lonely, and sometimes shows a more fragile side of herself. She relies on Lawrence for company as she fears loneliness, which is something that Lawrence is very aware of and tries to comfort her in his own way. Holo is also very aware of the different time spans that she and Lawrence have, as a human lifespan is like a blink of an eye for her kind. Holo is quite scared of that fact, but hides it with jokes. She has a peculiar way of speaking, modeled after that of the oiran high-class courtesans. She is fond of delicious food and alcohol, but especially loves apples. She takes pride in her tail and takes special care of it, constantly combing and maintaining it.\"-MyAnimeList character description\\n\\n\r\nWords I'd use to describe Holo is stubborn, not easy to please, childish, and wise as her name, \"Holo the wise wolf\" implies. She tends to say things she regrets later and tends to win a lot of arguments. She tends to get people to do as she wishes. Holo hates to be alone and that's why she hangs onto Lawrence so dearly. She had been alone for such a long time before she met Lawrence and is petrified of even thinking of being alone. As the quote at the top of my review implies, she thinks loneliness and death give you the same feeling.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I love about Holo is despite all of her flaws, she still remains a lovable and identifiable character. Why you may be asking to yourself right now, well I'll do my best to explain why. Her interactions to Lawrence just give this anime it's flavor to the soup. Those scenes made her such a fun character. We've all at some point have been alone and we can all relate to Holo's dilemma and fears. It just made her feel so much more human and it's nice to know she has flaws, positive traits, fears, and things she loves. She is defiantly a great character and what you think of when you hear the words, \"Spice and Wolf.\"\\n\\n\r\nYou're probably wondering why I didn't give the characters a ten, well I do have some flaws to point out in the character department, the supporting cast is quit forgettable. The show just has a habit of introducing characters, then forgetting about them. Like the character, Chole. She was only there for the first episode then forgotten about until the halfway point, then she never appears ever again. I would've like to see more from her and her background. This is just me trying to grasp for straws here, the show is still great as it is.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI haven't met a person who hates Spice and Wolf and I hope you never find any either. You'll love the interactions between the main characters, the balance of drama and comedy, the art style, the opening, and the dub. I know you'll enjoy something about Spice and Wolf.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something enjoyable with a great main cast to go along with that, this is a great show to check out. If you're looking for something dark, suspenseful, and action-packed, you should probably look in a different direction. It's one of my favorites for a reason. Well that's it for me, I hope you enjoyed the review!",

            "content": "Well, I think it is time for me to write my first English review. \r\nWhen you imagine a medieval fantasy anime, you think of knight, dragon, mage and Legolas. Well, Spice and Wolf don't has those. In fact, Spice and Wolf approach the ''med fantasy'' with a very unique direction: economics. Instead of war, fight and magic, the action of Spice and Wolf revolve around trade and currency. So, expect many dialogue.  Especially since romance is very important here.\r\nStory:\r\nLawrence Kraft is a travelling pedlar who come back in the village of Pasloe. Unfortunately for him, the village is in the middle of a paganfestival, making him unable to stay there. This festival is in honour for Holo, the wolf god of good harvest. While quitting the village, he will find a little (naked) girl in is cart who pretend to be Holo. In fact, she is really Holo, and this is the beginning of their journey to the north.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is, maybe, the flaw of the series. It's not bad, far from that. But, it's quite simple: small arch revolving around a trade one after the other. There is a main plot (to return to the north), but it's really vague and not much developed in the anime (except in season 2). \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the main plot is marginal: the heart of the series is the relationship between Lawrence and Holo.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is quite good. Even if the movement aren't that fluid, the characters, their expression and the background are perfectly done. Unfortunately, I don't have a Bluray of the first season... But, I got it for the second, and it's really something.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis is very good. It's not the soundtrack that you will listen in your IPod (except if you like medieval music), but this is a perfect soundtrack for this series. Far better than ''We will Rock you'' in a certain medieval movie of Ledger ;) . The OP have one of the better music of the industry and the seiyuu are perfect. For the dub, I must say that I love the work of the voice actor. Maybe, even more then the japanese one. For the ending, it's simply funny.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe best point of the series. Lawrence is far better than the average main male character of the industry. He got some wits, personality and he can make mistake. He's development is well as well, even if the series touch only to the first half of the light novel series.\\n\\n\r\nBut, he looks pale in comparison to Holo. She is simply one of the best developed character of japanimation. Somewhere between the tsundere, the kid, the sage and the fragile, she's more human that the vast majority of lead female character.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, she got a tail et wolf ears. It's important ;) .\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIt's my favourite series so my review might be biased. The romantic comedy between Holo and Lawrence is a real pleasure for the mind, even if it's kinda slow. The economic part is well build and give to the anime a unique complexity. \\n\\n\r\nSo, if you love only action brain-less anime, don't wath it. If not, try Spice and Wolf. Maybe your life will be a little more spicy after :p .\\n",

            "content": "(read before marking help full or unhelpful)\r\n(this show has dub suggestion by me over sub. Dub has better dialog translation and Holo sounds older than 15, as she should)\r\nA wise man once said that it is not the destination, but the journey that defines us. The journey of life if you will. And no other show I have watch has shown me this more than Spice and Wolf. Spice and wolf is the story of a travelling merchant named Lawrence during what appears to be the enlightenment era in Europe. This Merchant one day finds a naked women in his cart(hair censored ftw). Whothen in turn reveals herself as a wolf spirit  named Holo. Holo who had been worshiped as a god of harvest in the town he just traded in; has left because the people have stopped praying to her and pray only to the \"one god\"(allot of gawd talk in this anime as is for the period). The Merchant then agrees to take the goddess back north to her homeland.  This enlightenment Merchant being some what god raised (as was for period) is somewhat disturbed by taking a \"pagan goddess\", but soon gets over it and their journey begins. \\n\\n\r\nNow that the introductions of plot and main characters are out of the way shall i discuses what it did well and wrong? And whether you as the reader should or shouldn't watch it due to your tastes?  \\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10: Now why 9/10? I probably would normally give an 8/10 for this story and was debating as such, but I  leaned to 9/10. This is due the story being of a certain taste. Spice and wolf is extremely dialog heavy.  There is barely any action what so ever. The interesting part  though is the characters and their journeys through the lands. This is accompanied not by roving bands of bandits, but business deals and carefully calculated economics.  Its the betrayals and deals via business and  the ways our \"wise wolf\" goddess and our \"experience\" merchant handle every situation. This is basically the entire story. If you want some over arching plot with action everywhere go back to the shonnens . But, if you want a well crafted episodic journey with witty dialog and surprisingly interesting economics then you should press on.\\n\\n\r\nArt:7/10 Nothing special ok for its time, was done by a new animation company and had a somewhat low budget. Yet, is not bad by any standards.\\n\\n\r\nSound:8/10 Some medieval jaunts and other tunes in osts. Yet, the Opening  is completely divine. It is sung by the voices of the main characters and sets the tone so well it scares me.  Yet, no other songs stick out. Thus only +1 from average(ratting scale on profile) \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:10/10 OK the dialog is the show. The two main protagonist are the show. Spic and wolf is told by the perspective of both of the mains, and follows which ever when the times calls for it. Though it follows the perspective of mainly Lawrence the merchant. The interaction is  amazing, its right on par with Steins;Gate and if you thought that was good you'll like Spice and wolf's characters. Let us start with Holo, she i s wolf goddess that  has been in a filed of wheat for 700 years and is some what depressed and rarely shows it as she is peppy and witty most of the time. After being stuck in a  field for 700 years  and has not seen anything outside the old village. She then enjoys all the new sights and tastes on her journey. As she discovers each thing, you also feel that you discover it. Lawrence though is an Honest peddler and goes from place to place. He is overly good nature d, yet extremely shrew when it comes to his work. In Spice and Wolf many Characters are introduced, but it never goes to their perspective, though each in unique and adds their own flair to the plot. Thus flawless in character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10 I loved this show, was very good watch  for my tastes especially. The Nature of the plot and the interactions of the characters work in near harmony. Yet, for some this show may be too slow paced and monotonous. Yet, Spice and Wolf teaches us that sometimes one needs to  slow down, smell the roses and enjoy the journey of life. Thus Spice and Wolf gets a 9/10\\n",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf review: By John Kim\r\nPrerequisite: There is nothing I love more than being pleasantly surprised by anime, and Spice and Wolf delivers on all fronts, even managing to excel in some areas. Spice and Wolf certainly has captured my heart, and with a collection of memorable characters, charming and witty dialogue, and beautifully detailed scenarios, Spice and Wolf is a definite step ahead of most anime and deserves to go down in the books as a classic, if not a genre breaking show. \r\nStory: Ah, the world of merchants and business. Set in a medieval-type world, Spice and Wolf, doesn&rsquo;t have the mostexciting premise, but all the same, that&rsquo;s what makes it so great. The fact is, that anime today has been devolved into a mesh of guns, explosions, senseless action, and stereotypical settings, with story being placed as second priority. Spice and Wolf delivers a sophisticated and extremely well crafted and balanced world that is truly a shining gem is a sea of redundant and overused stories. Moving on to the events, and the main plot itself, Spice and Wolf features many conflicts and moments that normally would never be entertaining, in fact, many of the events in Spice and Wolf are normal everyday bland happenings, but this is again where the show shines. The two characters, Lawrence, and Horo, truly make this show a captivating experience. The everyday normal happenings of a traveling merchant may not be the most exciting thing in the world, but the chemistry between Lawrence and Horo gives us some of the most well acted dialogue I&rsquo;ve ever heard of in an anime. The show deals quite largely on several themes, but are all relevant. Human nature is put into question many times throughout the story, and many moral questions about trade and business ethics will be put into question. I would rather not ruin the story of Spice and Wolf because unlike most anime, it&rsquo;s best to witness first hand a brilliant story in motion. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Skipping ahead here. In my honest belief, the characters in Spice and Wolf, most notably Horo and Lawrence, are what truly makes this show a step above the rest. Spice and Wolf is wise to feature a strong cast of side characters, but never taking the spotlight off Lawrence and Horo. As I have said before, this show has something most anime, nay, most any form of media lacks. And that is chemistry between characters. Watching to interaction between Horo and Lawrence has been one of the very few joys I have found in watching anime. These two characters aren&rsquo;t merely a collage of archetypes, and stereotypes. Horo and Lawrence are believable, real, and most importantly genuinely charming characters that have soul. Horo and Lawrence aren&rsquo;t cookie cutter characters that are a collection of other past characters from other anime. They are truly alive, and that kind of dynamic translates itself onto the viewer. Just for an example, there are times when Horo and Lawrence are merely talking about something as redundant as the value of certain currency in contrast to others. But because, these two characters have so much chemistry, the scene becomes memorable and the plot expands and grows. It&rsquo;s not often a story rests on the shoulders of the characters to advance the narrative, but Spice and Wolf is a rare example that works. Horo&rsquo;s charm, and Lawrence&rsquo;s, indecisive &ldquo;softy&rdquo; behavior, are both small facets of their multi layered personalities. Just like real people, the viewer will never be able to completely comprehend these characters, and such sophisticated and complex characters, warrants a high degree of praise. Witty and clever dialogue, tense moments of silence, moments of fond laughter, is just the tip of the iceberg of what to expect from Horo and Lawrence&rsquo;s travels. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: It&rsquo;s superb. What else can I say? In all due honesty, half way through the show I no longer cared whether the animation was top notch or not, I was too dazzled and enamored by the dynamics between Horo and Lawrence, that I just simply ceased to notice. Need good art, to enjoy a show? Don&rsquo;t worry, you won&rsquo;t be deterred if you are hell-bent on jaw dropping visuals, Spice and Wolf won&rsquo;t let you down, take my word for it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I&rsquo;m going on a limb and assuming voice acting is a given in this category, which warrants it an automatic ten. The voice acting is nothing short of brilliant, and I would argue, that the voice acting in this show rivals the acting skills of acting legends. We are talking about some of the most amazing chemistry between characters I have ever seen in an anime, and it was through the voice acting that much if this chemistry was established. Expect nothing short of perfection, the complexity in the lines delivered have so many nuances that you will be spinning in your chair. The music also heightens the atmosphere and only adds to the show&rsquo;s success. The opening and ending are both fitting themes, admittedly, the ending was the weaker of the two. Nevertheless, all your senses will be on a ride from start to finish, your ears included. So don&rsquo;t worry about the sound, Spice and Wolf has it covered. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment &amp; Overall: Spice and Wolf, looking at it now, deserves more acclaim and praise than it has received. A classic? Perhaps not, but an amazing work of art that not only stirs the human soul, but also captivates our hearts and minds: that is what Spice and Wolf is. The show may not be for everyone, and in a sense, the show isn&rsquo;t for most people, but for those who are sick of your day to day, bland, and monotonous anime outings, prepare to be surprised. Spice and Wolf is truly a rare gem, and deserves to be recognized as such. It is not very often a show delivers something new and refreshing, and it&rsquo;s even more rare for a show to actually moves the heart of it&rsquo;s viewer. Spice and Wolf is an anime that may go unremembered, but for what its worth, Spice and Wolf is the culmination of the last bit of originality, creativity, and beautiful character driven story-telling, left in the anime industry. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf is an interesting series to say the least. Despite being a romantic comedy, a genre that typically inspires audible groans whenever I am subjected to it, this series actually manages to avoid many of the annoying pitfalls found in this genre.  The tale of Lawrence and Holo, our protagonists is one that took me by surprise and showed me that this genre still has life.\r\n\tFirstly, the art and animation in this series is fairly adequate. Particularly, the backgrounds are done very well done and definitely do well in breathing life into the world. You can also tell that this isa very eastern European inspired world because of the art. The characters themselves are drawn nicely aswell. The animation itself is nothing special, but doesn\u2019t need to be to begin with, as the majority of the show consists of talking. There are a few action sequences here and there however, and they\u2019re animated consistently with the art. One thing in particular I want to draw notice to is Holo, the main heroine\u2019s design, in particular her eyes. They\u2019re very expressive and show her mischievous nature which is a very important part of what makes her character work. You can tell they took great care in how they came up with her design as it mirrors her personality perfectly. Overall though, I have to say that this is a show that is pleasant to look at. It\u2019s not amazing by any means, but still fairly above average.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe music in this anime is also fairly good. I especially enjoyed the opening and ending themes of the first seasons, although I didn\u2019t care for the new ones in the second season.  Otherwise, the music that plays during the actual show is done well and applies itself accordingly to what\u2019s on screen. A lot of the music in it had this folk kind of feel to it, which I think perfectly fits the show. Now I have not listened to the Japanese dub but I can safely say that the English dub is a great one especially because of Brina Palencia who doesthe voice of Holo. She brings a sense of mischief, yet regal-ness to her character that is simply perfect. Michael Tatum as Lawrence is also done very well. Since Lawrence is kind of the straight man to Holo, he does a good job having a slight annoyance to his voice when putting up with Holo\u2019s antics. Besides our protagonists the rest of the cast perform their roles well.\\n\\n\r\n\tSpice and Wolf is primarily about Kraft Lawrence who is a traveling merchant whose goal is to make enough money to open up his own shop and Holo, a 600 year old wolf spirit who wants to go back to her home in Yoits. After the two meet for the first time Lawrence agrees to take her back to her home and the majority of the show is them traveling. What makes this show really work is the chemistry between these two. Unlike other shows like Inuyasha, where the interactions feel needlessly drawn out or unnatural, Lawrence and Holo honestly feel like they\u2019re real people and just sound like they truly enjoy each other\u2019s company. Holo, like I\u2019ve mentioned before is a fairly mischievous character and she loves to toy with Lawrence. Lawrence becomes easily flustered with her due to his inexperience with women. This does change however. Throughout the two seasons of the show, the relationship these two have goes through a gradual development that feels very real. Lawrence becomes more quick witted and starts to retort Holo\u2019s jokes. However the show isn\u2019t simply watching them having fun together as there are conflicts the two endure during the course of their journey. Given that Holo is a wolf spirit, this often causes problems in more than one occasion and even Lawrence himself makes mistakes that get them into trouble. The show does a good job of keeping your interest for the most part; however I feel it sometimes gets too convoluted in one area in particular. A main point of the show is Lawrence being a merchant. A lot of the talk in the show deals with mercantilism and it can be hard to follow. Some of the things that happened in the second season for example went right over my head and I usually never have that sort of an issue. Still I have to admit that this is a small complaint in what is largely a very enjoyable story.\\n\\n\r\n\tIn the end Spice and Wolf is a show that I highly recommend. With decent art, great music, and a simply wonderful duo of protagonists, Spice and Wolf is a joy to watch. Granted, this is not a show for everyone but  to those that it does appeal to, I find it hard to believe that you won\u2019t enjoy it and hey maybe you\u2019re like me and this normally isn\u2019t the kind of show you like and it will impress you as much as it impressed me. \\n",

            "content": "Well i must say i feel very bad for not watching this show sooner.This is what made me feel happy after one of episodes, and i didn't even notice smile on my face.\r\nStory: So story is about trader Lawrence and Holo which is godess/wolf deity, call it whatever u want.Upon some circustances they ended up traveling together ( Lawrence recognised that Holo can ride people easily) and doing trades together.If you really like business and i mean selling things which prices go up and down, and want to train your brain for things like that, this is right thing for you.Chemistry between them is oneof factors of this story, how they laugh together,get in fights together and other things couple do but they don't notice that.A lot of plots ( which is expected from anime where is main story about trading ) maded it feel like you could actualy trade with them in 3rd person standing next in room.And there is church which is dominant so they need to be beware.Also story is developing fast so you won't have to wait till like 6th episode and things like that, in other words u will be intro it from episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Now art is quite beautifull but art in season 2 is even better so if i could i would give 11 to s2 :) Beautifull views, everything is on spot except few glitches like horse running on epilepsy.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Now this is what i need to praise the most. This is easily one of the best music/soundtrack i have ever heard in anime and this is full jack pot, using flaute as main instrument in old fashioned surrounding.With all these energetic people ( mainly traders ) its pure satisfaction.Also opening is phenomenal too, one of the best i heard too.Voice acting is also on the spot, and i think they couldn't find better voice actors than Koshimizu Ami and Fukuyama Jun\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: So Lawrence is confident,shy,sometimes introvert, sometimes extrovert person. He caught my eyes since beggining of series and i could say i know a lot of people like him and you can enjoy while you are with them.Development of him is right on spot, not rushed, not slowed just like it needed to be.\\n\r\nHolo is  cute/beautifull girl which is full of herself and so inteligent, and love to teases people and tricking them.Character development with her is also majestic and bond between her and Lawrence is quite strong since begining of the series.\\n\r\nAnd every supportive character is right on the spot. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: So this is one of few shows i actually keep liking more and more from begining to end and i really wanted it to have more seasons, and i know a lot of more people would love too. Didn't regret this show, not a single second of it.And i actually feel sad cause this doesn't have more seasons.And there was a lot of sad and happy moments.Sad moments would hit so hard, just like getting stabbed in the heart.i remember my eyes being blury cause one of those moments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This is easily one of best shows with simple story i ever saw.Not a single thing was wrong with this show.So yeah i suggest you to watch it right now cause u will feel bad if you missed this masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nAnd only and only thing that bugs me in this show is their ageing, imagine how broken Holo will be cause Lawrence will get old and change body while she will still be in her teens, and of course he will die before her leaving her and daughter Myuri alone.And she will probably find another man like she did before Lawrence. Damn it.\\n\\n\r\nHope you liked my review.",

            "content": "Craft Lawrence was an ordinary merchant until he came across the pagan wolf deity Horo, disguised as a cute wolf-girl. In exchange for assisting him in his work Horo asks that he take her with him to see the world and to go home. Lawrence has no idea what he's gotten himself into, but accepts his fate to travel with her in search of himself and their fortune together.\r\nStory & Characters (8/10)\r\nSet in the fictional renasanse world, the story follows a girl Horo who is a sage wolf and a guy who is a merchant named Lawrence.\r\nThese are some of the good aspects of theanime. The story itself mostly focuses on those two characters and their traveling. The world that the story is set in, is very nicely and best put to actually explain how the world at that time functioned and the people that lived there. Mostly these two characters. What is special about them is that both are different in their own personality. One is human, other is wolf. Both of them are met by a strong bond and set on a wide journey.\\n\r\nYou will find it interesting how Horo is always the smart one and always get them out of the situation, while the Lawrence is more experienced one though in most cases he doesn\u2019t act like that so he gets help from Horo, while actually both of them are pendent of each other.\\n\r\nOne thing that may lack here is how the story slowly and fast progresses. This may sound weird, but it is just because it is. The story itself may sound confusing at first, but as you more watch you will begin to understand. What may take you for that are some of the historical knowledge, especially from that era. How classes were formed, beliefs, faiths, currency and such. But that all may prove it to be even more confusing to most audience, because later when you just figure one thing from there, another comes which takes whole episode of explaining and you might just end more and more confused. Until later you actually find out what really happened. When I wrote this review I first watched few episodes and to be honest I was a little disappointed on how the story progress. Later though I became liking it more and more. It truly is something special and different. No, better to say unique. What most might hold you is the suspense when Lawrence needs to do something. There are always challenges, always something behind the angle that you might miss, but that might later come. The suspense will keep you for actually looking at the screen and just waiting and waiting impatiently what will happen next. It is something not seen in many anime, but presented here. That all is build even more by good detailed camera angles and music that covers that all up. The only bad thing is that all this might be the result that would keep someone away from watching and enduring it, but few of them would actually stand up after getting caught in one of these scenes. Other thing I have to mention is that many characters become easily forgotten, even the ones that you might think might get more screen time. There are always new characters by each town they visit and always new adventures. Then again, there is a good thing behind it that it leaves more space for the main character and their strong personalities, but it is just matter of taste. \\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\r\nThe overall graphics in this anime, to get it out at the beginning, are on an average level. Both the animations and the drawings are like that. There are not many chances in the beginning where you can actually see some changes with animation, since they are mostly just walking to one spot to another and talking and so on. Now this anime has some interesting habit. It gets better from episode to episode in terms of the overall quality that it is made. While it also gets more confusing with that, but that\u2019s for something else.\\n\r\nEven if the drawings are average and not something special unlike many other animes, there are some things that I should praise. Those are the color blending and the classic-ness that is presented here. The colors are very nicely done. You can notice that by all the periods that change, as well by the nature and the details of surroundings and even the characters too, though in their cases they are more sharp, but that is normal.\\n\r\nWhen I mentioned that this anime has classic drawings, I didn\u2019t meant overly classic. When I see it, I see a combination of the style that is used in 90-is combined with the style of the newest animes. It gives a good impression of the overall anime and it is one of the best styles that could be used for this type of it. Though there is one thing that I have to mention about graphics and that is cuteness. Yes, they are quite cute, especially with all the actions that Horo does. Some may think that it comes from the presentation section, but it is the animations actually that make that possible. \\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nNow this is the part that might be different for different viewers. And that is the overall OST. You will feel almost not even noticing it through the whole episodes. You might, but actually thinking about it would not get too much attention, only later though. Only later you will remember all these nice little songs that very with it, but they are still on the average side. On the other hand this also has some interesting things behind it. And that is the opening and ending song. While to some it may be a little slow and not suited for this anime, I think that it is actually very well done for this short anime. Especially the ending song, you will always stay wanting to hear it till the end, because it really gives the impression like it was made just for this anime.\\n\r\nNow there is another aspect why the OST may not be so needed. It is the sound effects. They are very well done here and you will even notice some small like horse riding to those of wolf cry (or song or whatever you want to call it). Even the voice acting is tried to be done the best it could be to match the people from that age. And by that I mean Europeans, because the overall surrounding looks like it is set in renesanse Central Europe. And yes, that\u2019s what\u2019s really good. Not only outstanding voice acting, but also music that accompanies that. To some poor, but actually it gives a good medieval effect around it. Though this is not really the medieval age, it could be said that it is the late one and still it gives a nice touch to it. Sound effect are also on a good level, from carts moving, horses, running and all other things. You will find all that maybe not that noticeable, but very enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nA fun, entertaining, romantic, yet serious anime set in the history of real world combined with the folklore tales... If that is the anime that you are looking for, the look no further, you just found one. The overall presentation of it is something that should be praised. Mostly because of their characters, their deep personalities and the world that is surrounded by them. Now we get here some negative things behind it. This anime may be confusing to some and boring at first. But even then, it only requires some basic history knowledge for you to actually understand it. You can try to portrait yourself where the world is set, how the church works there, what are these heretics, what is the main purpose of the merchants and the system in which they work, how the currencies change and so on and so on...\\n\r\nOne of the other things which could be noticed by many viewers is the actual approach of the characters. Characters at first develop too fast and too sudden for some, but actually everyone, take a closer look after a few episodes. What is the relation between Horo and Lawrence? Can anyone say? Well you can guess, but not give the true answer, because you are not sure yourself. But that what you know is somewhat nice resting in you. You know in what will become, but when always there is a situation to show that it just skips. To some it may be annoying, but just give it time. Give it time, later everything comes on it\u2019s place and for fast paced growing storyline it actually falls on a careful and calm one. And soon you will noticed what Horo actually is and her feelings and personality. Yes, that\u2019s what it is good here. Not many characters, no no. But definitely it is given a lot attention to those are there, especially two main ones. You will at one moment even feel like you are in that fable, you will quite enjoy it.\\n\r\nWhen I mentioned historical knowledge, I really meant that. You have to understand the world that it is set it. It is much realistic and a good presentation of the real medieval world. That might become boring, because just when you think that something might happen, everything goes calmly. Here action doesn\u2019t take place with swords, powers and magic. Here\u2026 it takes place with economy, swiftness, logic and mind. Can you enter that mind? Well it is your choice to find out!",

            "content": "A friend of mine once told me that a show lives or dies on its characters, and while this statement may seem rather self explanatory, it\u2019s shame to see just how often such a fundamental part of a show can be left in the dust to make way for other aspects to receive more polish. While I do appreciate and admire said other aspects reviving polish, it goes without saying but regardless as to how much time is spent making some action sequence the most eye poppingly vibrant array of colours to ever be put into film, I generally won\u2019t find them all that interestingif I don\u2019t give a damn about anyone involved, regardless as to if I like or dislike them.\\n\\n\r\nSpice and wolf is a show that realises that it can\u2019t try to be the jack of all trades, but it\u2019s quite happy being the master of one.\\n\\n\r\nS&W begins following the travels of a merchant called Laurence through what can only be described as a mild fantasy version of medieval Europe, whilst stopping by in a local town, Laurence accidentally picks up our other main character, a Pagan wolf-god in human form (abit with wolf ear\u2019s and a tail) who goes by the name Holo. She wishes to be aided to travel to her home up north and from there on out, S&W focuses less on the destination and more on the journey. \\n\\n\r\nSimply put, the two characters of Laurence and Holo are both wonderfully realised and their interactions with one another are a joy to watch. Part of this charm extends from the fact that their characters are rooted in reality, Laurence himself is just a ordinary guy who just happens to be in extra-ordinary circumstances and similarly Holo, despite being a wolf, is a rather human character, flaw\u2019s and all. This isn\u2019t a show about action sequences and nor is it one about forced relationships, instead S&W get\u2019s by on solid writing and acting alone. \\n\\n\r\nInitially in the opening few episodes conversations had a tendency to flow un-naturally every now and then but as time goes on it becomes quite clear that Laurence and Holo become more relaxed with one another and both the writing and the acting reflect this subtle change over time. Though it\u2019s well worth mentioning that more then just this change is captured well; Brina Palencia gives a sense of playful regality to Holo which perfectly reflects her character as one to not act without thought nor having not thought out what to do when acting, even in the most serious of situations. Though her mannerisms also play a welcome role in defining Holo\u2019s character, flicks of a tail and ear flops speak more then words ever could and this is carried over to other elements to. Even Holo\u2019s posture, pose and language seek to reflect her status as a wolf at times and it really is a splendid use of the medium. \\n\\n\r\nHolo isn\u2019t the only one standing in the spot light though and Laurence thankfully get\u2019s a similar treatment. J. Michael Tatum employs a cautious and collected tone to Laurence, which given his current occupation go rather well in hand with another more curious tone as he consistently seeks to find a new way of making profit via an opening in a new market or at the suggestions of others.\\n\\n\r\nTogether, the two of them are constantly poking fun at each another and making snarky remarks at the expense of one another. None of the interaction feel\u2019s forced and never does the show stoop to include risqu\u00e9 scenarios to appease fan service. The relationship between Laurence and Holo feel\u2019s natural as it develops over time and it is by far the best thing the show has going for it.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately though, S&W doesn\u2019t just have character interaction on its plate as is suffers from doing a number of other things fairly well, but not really all that well in comparison to the aforementioned interaction. \\n\\n\r\nThe first of these is what actually happens in each episode, throughout its length, S&W encompasses a small number of story arch\u2019s that play out in a way that I could only really describe as finance battles, with great focus spent of detailing how the economy works in the world of S&W, and just as much time spent talking about how to take advantage of it for the sake of profit. And while I can applaud the decision to try and stem high risk scenarios from a source other then gratuitous violence, I can\u2019t deny the fact that generally, I just found the proceeding\u2019s of these stories dull. Their pacing is more at home on the medium that S&W was originally written for but in a TV show spread out over a number of episodes they loose their appeal.\\n\\n\r\nTo an extent, these stories do serve a purpose quite well because they allow us to see more from the main characters. Seeing the otherwise calm Laurence loose himself over his current situation and subsequently seeing how Holo reacts to this new side of her friend does continue to aid their development as characters, and in that regard the show still holds its appeal throughout these sequences. \\n\\n\r\nOr at least it would do if it wasn\u2019t common for the two main characters to be separated for what ever reason in such sequences leaving us with the small selection of side characters that populate S&W\u2019s roster. None of these characters are massively deep in any way and nor are they voiced in a way to write home about, and it\u2019s unfortunate to say it, but even for a world that holds quite a bit of potential, it doesn\u2019t really have anyone else to show for that fact, and it\u2019s a real downer considering how well things are handled else were. \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem with said finance battles is that they primarily take place in city\u2019s and the art work for the city\u2019s is a place were the budget of S&W is quite present, for the most part, the streets are rather empty giving an almost convenient lack of life to the environments. This is excusable given how much time it takes to animate a crowd, but the problem really stems from the streets themselves. If you go into any urban environment you will immediately notice a lack of coherence between structures, building heights and widths vary here and there and each architect\u2019s own style can be seen adorning each building with love. S&W doesn't really capture this not nearly well enough to give the cities a sense of vibrancy in amongst the chaos of urban living, the repeated vanishing point perspectives and rather dull straight edges that are pretty common give the setting an almost sterile feel to them that really doesn't lend its self well to the setting or show considering the length of time that is spent in said cities. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s worth noting though that the country side backgrounds are generally an exception to the rule and do remain pleasing enough to the eye throughout the show\u2019s duration.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is unfortunately another area where the show suffers from it\u2019s budget, while expressions look nice enough most of the time, and the aforementioned mannerisms are lovely, for the most part the character art and the character animation is below par and rather choppy. This is excusable given the rare need of smooth animation, but it\u2019s a shame to be honest, and I would love to have seen it a bit smoother, or at least weightier at times.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarise, Spice and Wolf isn\u2019t the jack of all trades, nor is it a masterpiece, but it does what it does well and deserves credit for being a lovely and rather slow experience. If you\u2019re at all interested by all means give it a punt, because with any luck you might just like it more then you though you might.\\n",

            "content": "I now remember how I got to know the name Spice and Wolf, I think I was looking around for another anime's sequel or something when I stumbled on it's name, and then again I saw it's name. Seeing it like this and good words after it I decided to pick up the series and begin watching, what I found was one of my favorite anime of all time. \r\nThe story is wonderful, it deals with economics that can sometimes be hard to follow, romance, comedy, being alone, relationships, politics, drama, and other things as well. The story holds you tight as you sink deeperand deeper into it. The idea of them traveling is also a great as they visit new cities and see and face new people and challenges. I was also able to pick up on many quotes throughout my watching of the series and then again in my re-watch, as there is much dialog between the characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are wonderful, they are unique and funny, lovable, and so many more things. Holo and Lawrence are two of my favorite characters in anime, and the relationship they share is also wonderful, as it develops and as it moves, how they interact. It's wonderful. Not to mention characters that come up later in the series. Character development is also wonderful, it's great to see how they move and develop on the journey. Other characters don't see as much development as Lawrence and Holo, but there is still some for 'em. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music is some of the best I have encountered in anime, the opening is one of my favorite as it is an amazing song. I even used it as a ringtone of mine for quite a while. While the opening theme is more serious and such the ending theme is much less serious and much more fun, and is amazing as well. Rarely, actually I don't think I ever skipped the opening and maybe only skipped the ending once if that. Both the opening and the ending are also both rememberable. Not to mention that the soundtrack is great as well, maybe not as memorable but still done it's job. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation for the series is also well done and is really beautiful and nice to the eye, it was well done. The English voice acting was also very well done as I though each voice really fit the part and the character, I really didn't think about it too much as they started to meld into one, which happens a lot granted. I do normally have little complaint about voice acting, but this was well done. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe ending in the first season is okay, as I know that it had a second season that I quickly jumped to.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment of this series is immense and deep, I've re-watched it before and wouldn't even mind re-watching it again. I've also bought a wall large wall scroll last year at an anime convention with Holo on it and just recently was able to hang it up and this year I also bought a button with Holo on it as well. In fact I have on my desk a jar with smelly stuff in it, you know, with sticks coming out of it, that produces a wonderful scent and whenever I smell it one of the many things I think it brings to mind is Spice and Wolf, so as It starts to vanish, I am in need of a replacement.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall it is one of my favorite anime, with great stuff all round, it will always hold a special place in me. You might not like it as much as me, but I truly think that you will like this series and I'd ask you to just give it one episode or just the opening and I'm sure that it might just grab you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis was my first review, I'm not sure how you'll like it so clicking a helpful or a not helpful will help. Thanks and I hope you liked it.  \\n",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf is a series that I didn't expect much from. Little did I know, this would become one of my all-time favorites. \r\nI think most of the reviews are spot on when they say this is a story about the characters. Although the plot line of economics and spice trading may seem dull, the characters and development are true masterpieces. \r\nHolo is a character that you won't find in any other series and makes this series a masterpiece. Words cannot describe how brilliant her character development is. The interactions and progression of her feelings are on a different level, where the two MCsreally understand each other beyond words. There isn't the constant need to say \"I love you\" or kiss in every scene. In fact, the satisfaction in their relationship stems from how they deal with each conflict and ultimately grow closer with each obstacle. Holo's personality is an amalgam of being wise, stubborn, and caring rolled into one. And I might be forever flagged as an Otaku for saying this, but she really makes you wish you could meet someone as interesting, mysterious, and loving at the same time (wouldn't hurt to be a wolf god either).\\n\\n\r\nI need to reiterate that it truly is amazing that there are very few scenes where the MCs openly announce their affection for one another. You don't see them kiss constantly or tell each other \"I love you\". The plot itself shows their affection and bond with one another on a deeper, more human level.\\n\\n\r\nHaving watched the series a few weeks ago, I was disappointed to find that there really isn't a single series that even comes close to Spice and Wolf. This will forever remain a classic that I truly enjoyed every second of.\\n\\n\r\nBrief Vote Breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\r\n- Spice and Wolf is one of the few stories where you'll find a combination of fantasy, economics, comedy, and tear-jerking romance. These themes are not only unique, but also incredibly well balanced. Each episode flies by and leaves you wanting more.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\n- I thoroughly enjoyed the art. I thought the attention-to-detail was amazing and you can tell the artists really understood the time period they were working with.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\n- I went so far as to download all the sounds in the series. Like everything else about this series, they're really unique and remind me of the most heart-wrenching scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 100/10\\n\r\n- Yes, there's an extra 0. The character development is nothing short of a masterpiece. There's a lot of subtext, where the characters grow and understand each other through actions, tears, and laughter. It truly feels amazing when at the end of the series, you can tell the characters understand each other beyond words.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\n- This show was incredibly enjoyable to watch. I would finish an entire episode and realize my mouth was sore from smiling the entire time. Same goes for the heart-rending scenes.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nThere aren't a whole lot of shows that stay in your mind long after watching them and make you think deeply about the characters and their interactions. Spice and Wolf is a classic that will take you on ups and downs, leaving you feeling fuzzy inside or as if someone yanked your heart out. It truly is a one-of-a-kind masterpiece.",

            "content": "\"Understandably overrated\"\r\n\u201cLazy and arrogant adaptation of much better source material\u201d\r\n\u201cPerhaps written by Lawrence himself, since it values potential profit over good writing\u201d\r\nIt seems that, in art, there are certain works or artists that are viewed with such overwhelming and universal positivity and affection that speaking out against the said work automatically means one has bad taste.  For example, it's okay for anyone to bash Justin Bieber, but the moment you say one thing negative about the Beatles, you are instantly branded a bratty teenager with terrible taste in music; people may even accuse you of being a Bieber-lover.\r\nSpice and Wolf no doubt holds asimilar position among anime fans, being one of the most universally beloved works in the genre.  So I risk my very credibility as an anime-reviewer in writing this less-than-glaring review of Spice and Wolf.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe way I see it, there are 4 ways Spice and Wolf could have turned out:\\n\\n\r\n1. Amazing/Ideal: An impeccable and consciously-written work that is at once a quality romantic comedy AND a fascinating economical thriller.  (I place the original light novel at this tier)\\n\\n\r\n2. Great: A highly unique piece of anime art that incorporates economical themes into an engaging storyline, while providing a decent romantic comedy on the side.\\n\\n\r\n3. Good/Okay: A solid romantic comedy that sets itself apart from others by including some economical themes.\\n\\n\r\n4. Bad/Terrible: A complete failure of an anime that fails to deliver on both fronts.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAfter having run through both seasons, I am inclined to place the series at number 3: a decent romantic comedy with a likeable character that tries to weave in some mercantile intrigue.  I shall henceforth discuss why I came to adopt this viewpoint.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, there is no denying the fact that Spice and Wolf has an adorable romance line.  There is great chemistry between the two leads.  Speaking of leads, Horo is SUCH a breakout character for this show.  She is the reason this show exists, the reason it works to the degree that it does, and most likely the sole reason for its popularity.  What is there to not love about this adorable fox-girl.  Yeah, yeah I know she\u2019s  WOLF, but for all intents and purposes she is the typical kitsune fox-girl commonly seen in the genre, with FOX ears and FOX tails and FOX personality.  She is visually cute, both to the viewers and the characters in-universe, as repeatedly noted.  Her personality is delightfully tsundere, coy and playful.  In short, Horo is a memorable character\u2026 but that\u2019s about it for this show.\\n\\n\r\nTake a look at Lawrence.  His entire character and pertaining story arcs can be summed up in one sentence: a mild-mannered and hard-working merchant. That\u2019s it.  He has no intriguing backstory, no hints of hidden depths, no moments of personal triumph, and no character development.  Lawrence, as a character, was obviously slated to be an intelligence-type hero, one who, like Odysseus from Greek Mythology, triumphs through guile and wit.  Yet, never once in the series does he solve a serious conflict through his own acumen.  It\u2019s always some deus ex machina (usually in the form of Horo) that swoops in to save the day after everything he tries has failed.  There is definitely potential for interesting character flaws, such as his greed often popping up, and the fact that he values profit over morality.  Such developments, however, are presented in such lazy writing that they may as well not have been hinted in the first place.  In the parts where he gets himself in trouble because of his greed, it is never clearly foreshadowed that he was being overly greedy until the world has already come tumbling down around him a few episodes later, then it is mentioned that this was because of his greed in the previous story arc.  Basically, when he successfully makes profit, it is retrospectively thanks to his ambition and balls, and when he gets into trouble, it is retrospectively because he was \u201cgreedy.\u201d  Another interesting character flaw that could have potentially set him apart from many other straightlaced protagonists--that he values profit over doing the right thing--is only mentioned off-handedly during one of his many banters with Horo.  Never does this turn into character development of him realizing that money isn\u2019t everything, etc.  In short, the character Lawrence exists only to further highlight how adorable Horo is.  He is awkward and dorky just so Horo can coyly tease him, and be ADORABLE in the process.  Other times, he is suddenly and inexplicably savvy and teasing, just so Horo can be flustered and pout, and be ADORABLE in the process.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the main protagonist was written this lazily, it goes without saying that the story-arc specific characters, such as Nora and Amarty, are completely flat, predictable, and unchanging.  It was repeatedly hinted that Nora might hide some dark side behind her sweet facade, but no, she was the sweet, innocent, and helpless shepherd to the very end.  Amarty was heavily hinted to also hide a darker side behind his likeable exterior, but no, he remained to the very end a young and starstruck hotshot.  Etc, etc, I rest my case on the characters.\\n\\n\r\nWith such uninspired characters (with the exception of Horo), it is only natural that the storyline is also flat and predictable.  Basically every story arc follows the same pattern:\\n\\n\r\n1. A new town is introduced with some pretty obvious \u201cgood\u201d characters and equally obvious \u201cshady\u201d characters.\\n\r\n2. Lawrence gets tricked by the shady character into a dire situation.\\n\r\n3. Lawrence tried to do something, but effectively gets nothing done.\\n\r\n4. Horo, along with the \u201cgood\u201d characters, saves the day.\\n\r\n5. Horo gets mad at Lawrence for \u201cnot trusting her enough\u201d or \u201cbeing too nice to her.\u201d\\n\r\n6. Horo and Lawrence embrace.  Horo blushes.  Everything is A-OK. Awwww\\n\\n\r\nDo you see where I am going with all of this?  It was painfully obvious to me, as a reviewer of anime and other works AND as an amateur writer myself, that the writing staff freely used Horo as deus ex machina to both write themselves out of conflicts AND to sugarcoat otherwise poorly-written story arc.  I was almost insulted as a viewer by the lazy attitude of: \u201cwell we really stumbled through THAT storyline. Whatever, now watch Horo being adorable.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nReally, I have the utmost respect for artists and creators, so I hate to single people out, but there is just no euphemism: the director and adaptation-screenwriters for the anime adaptation were straight up lazy and unprofessional.  Just to confirm this before actually writing my review, I looked up the original light novel and read a few chapters.  COMPLETELY different experience.  The characters had hidden personalities, desires, worries, insecurities, and redeeming qualities that were not at all portrayed in the anime adaptation.  The story arcs were well-paced with great balance between the cutesy romance and economical intrigue.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of economical intrigue, that was really the nail on the coffin for me.  This could\u2019ve been such a UNIQUE anime that makes an engaging and nail-biting story out of the unexpected and boring topic of economics, but this goldmine is brushed aside in the adaptation for sake of MOAR HORO TIME.  The economical battle-of-wits between the characters that took up pages in the light novel are dumbed down to a few frames of dialogue in the anime. It\u2019s like \u201cokay so  we got the boring econ stuff out of the way. Now for the actual reason people would watch this.\u201d This decision I can somewhat sympathize with: if you\u2019re on the board of investors for the show, what do you think will bring in better sales?  Discussion of economics and mercantilism, or CUTE FOX GIRL? (Again, I get that she\u2019s supposed to be a wolf)  But again, it boils down to laziness in writing.  Other greater works have shown that even the most mundane topics can make for nail-biting storyline.  Look at Shokugeki no Soma and tell me cooking is boring.  Watch Dagashi Kashi and tell me cheap candies aren\u2019t fun to watch.  It is this taking the easy way out attitude, the heavy reliance on deus ex machina of ADORABLE HORO that really led me to condemn the anime adaptation as lazily written.  Again, I would perhaps be a bit more understanding of this \u201ccreative decision\u201d had I not seen other works that \u201ccould have\u201d let one attractive character carry the show, but turned into much deeper and varied experience by the virtue of meticulous writing.  For example, Bakemongatari is a show that is often compared to Spice and Wolf, at least in terms of the chemistry between the two leads, and the overwhelming attractiveness of its female lead.  However, Bakemonogatari was brave enough to completely sidebench Senjougahara for the majority of the story because, as fascinating as that one character is, the show had plenty more to offer in terms of other smartly-written characters and dialogue.  On the other hand, there is Spice and Wolf, basically a one-character anime.  I even daresay that the reason for such overwhelming positivity regarding this series is similar in effect to when a pretty girl talks to you, and you completely overlook her less-savory nature because you are so struck by her beauty and blinded by your infatuation. I tried repeated to give Spice and Wolf the benefit of a doubt, but each subsequent lazy and poorly-paced story arc only further cemented my disappointment with the writing staff of the anime adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nJust look at one dialogue in Season 2.  Horo has just discovered a devastating truth and completely loses it, tearfully lashing out at Lawrence.  Nothing Lawrence says can calm her down, until she suddenly goes dark and cold. She flatly says \u201csorry\u201d and turns away from Lawrence.  She\u2019s clearly not in the mood to talk anymore, and, Lawrence, realizing this, walked out to leave her alone.  She doesn\u2019t stop him. THEN, many episodes later, after the conflict has been resolved, it\u2019s revealed that her suddenly turning cold and saying \u201csorry\u201d was actually her CALMING DOWN and being ready for a more rational talk; Lawrence only had to talk to her at that point.  I am sorry, but that is just terrible and lazy writing.  You simply don\u2019t do that in writing anime dialogue, or dialogue in any genre, for that matter.  That\u2019s a direct insult to the viewers, and, frankly, shows the lack of effort and consideration the writers and the director put into animating this pivotal scene.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the original light novel, at least the few parts I\u2019ve read before writing this review, is VERY intelligently-written and well paced.  I can only hope that there will be a third season or a new series altogether that does its source material better justice.\\n",

            "content": "I am very excited to be able to write a review about my favourite anime series to date. \r\nSpice and Wolf is certainly like nothing I've seen before. I've seen adventure shows, romance shows, and historical/fantasy shows, but there's nothing that can compare to Spice and Wolf in my opinion. The way the series functions is mostly through dialogue with very little monologue. This writing style allows the full display of the character chemistry that it's trying to portray between Lawrence and Holo, and is a solid foundation for the series to develop. I personally think that season one is there to make you reallycare for these characters and season two just pours it all out and takes a lot more emotional investment. Simply put, season one sets up the themes of season two as good as it can be.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of plot, there isn't a very clear storyline other than the merchant Kraft Lawrence, who's trying to make a living by going to different towns, finding Holo in his wagon and then beginning an adventure with her. That synopsis can seem dull on the surface, but this series is far from just that. The merchant life of Lawrence often creates situations involving money that can guide the story in one way or another; by doing so, the leads are able to develop their relationship through each event. The way that the series made me feel leading into each event and then resolving it is one of the most satisfying feelings I've gotten from watching an anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt is simple but gets the job done. The OPs and EDs are simply amazing. I've personally made a guitar medley of the songs on my channel to try to recapture the emotions I got from them as much as I possibly can because they are powerful songs beneath the surface. Mitsu no Yoake (OP2) and Perfect World (ED2) is written in a similar bittersweet tone where Holo knows she will outlive Lawrence so she's afraid of being alone. This is completely different from the season one songs which has a type of quirk to them and is a lot easier to digest. These beautiful songs and the wonderful Celtic/medieval themed soundtrack are just irreplaceable and essential for making the series what it is. \\n\\n\r\nHolo is the best heroine I've ever seen in any anime. She is a multidimensional character, a god-like figure, but beyond that she is also a very personable character. The way Holo talks is almost never how she actually thinks unless she is actually serious e.g. the Amarty arc in season two. Holo says things to Lawrence that is half implied and retracts it when Lawrence questions what she says/doesn't get her meaning and it's very clear to the audience what she means, but not to Lawrence. That brings us to Kraft Lawrence who is designed as a perfect compliment to allow the author to fully develop Holo's personality; part of that is what I've already mentioned - how clueless he is with Holo sometimes - but more importantly, they are able to give each other what the other needs. Holo has always feared being alone and Lawrence taking her and being her companion makes her very happy, while Holo's power and wisdom can benefit Lawrence in many ways. All in all, they are basically a perfect pair which makes it so interesting to watch their interactions and developments. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I have left to say is to just watch it. Both seasons. If you liked what I just said about it then it will not disappoint you. \\n\\n\r\n10/10",

Holo has special powers but she only uses them a few times to avoid being spotted by the church. the whole series is about craft Lawrence and Holo traveling and doing business together. their relationship startsoff being like business partners and then friends and even beyond that.lawrence is a smart and a very good merchant but holo seems to do better at times taking advantage of her looks and tricking other merchants. even if it starts off with nudity you shouldn't worry about them because it isn't like fanservice and it starts to disappear after the first episode, \"spice and wolf\" is one of best fantasy series I have ever seen and the part about the business world was really fun.",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf was originally a series of light novels written by Hasekura Isuna. The original novel won him the silver prize, or third place, for the Dengeki novel prize. The novels ran for seventeen volumes and the series quickly got manga, anime and video game adaptations. The first anime was done by Imagin, the studio responsible for Strawberry Panic among others. Spice and Wolf is really popular, but is it good? Let's take a look at the anime and find out.\r\nThe main story begins with an ordinary merchant named Craft Lawrence. He's going through a small village that's holding a festival when he findsa naked woman with lupine ears and a tail napping in his cart. She identifies herself as Horo the wise wolf, about a half a dozen times, and claims to be the deity that the villagers used to worship. She's grown weary of dealing with the people of the village and wants to return to the north. Lawrence agrees to take her. The series follows their journey as they go through several villages trying to make a profit. Let's dive right into the issues. The biggest issue is that there are a lot of moments that just drag on and get boring. Particularly the moments where Lawrence exposits about the economy of their fantasy world. They could have easily lost two or three episodes worth of content by cutting these speeches and lost nothing of value to the narrative. Really, it reminds me of the long descriptions that Victorian era literature included. The main difference is that this is worse since it's only thirteen episodes and the time could have easily been put to better use. The chemistry between Horo and Lawrence is really hit and miss. Some moments work others just come off as forced. That being said, there are some interesting ideas and I did really like what they did with the church in this. While there are some boring moments, there are also some really good, tense moments. Unfortunately, those moments tend to get resolved far too quickly and have no apparent impact beyond the immediate. That might be fixed in the second season, but it is an issue with this one.\\n\\n\r\nLet's move on to the characters. Most of the characters are pretty one-dimensional and under-developed. A lot of them even share the same vague motivation, making profit. Lawrence himself is a pretty stock character with very little personality or development. That being said, I loved the character of Horo. Horo gets some great dialogue, she's very interesting and she shows a lot of great development as a character. Spice and Wolf might be worth watching just for Horo. That's how awesome she is.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really well done. I can certainly see the visual similarities to Strawberry Panic. The various villages are lively and the backgrounds are very well done. The only real issue I had with the art is that the action scenes are kind of boring. They tend to end very quickly with Horo just kind of barreling through everyone. I know that action scenes with wolves can work, I saw Wolf's Rain, they just don't in this. You probably expected me to complain about Horo being shown naked so frequently, but there actually are valid story and character reasons for it, and they refrain from using them for mindless fan-service, mostly, so I didn't really have a problem with it. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is a little bland, but that's probably due largely to the character issues. Most of the characters just don't have any good dialogue so it's not surprising that the voice actors couldn't give their best performances. The only exception is Koshimuzu Ami who gives a very strong performance as Horo. The music is weak, especially the Engrish closing theme. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 1/10. There are all of three important female characters and they don't interact that much with each other. \\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Spice and Wolf is a 6/10. It's a decent anime that could have been much better. While there are some good ideas, the writing is weakened by a lot of padding and stilted dialogue. Horo is the only character worth mentioning. Although she is a spectacular character, she can't carry the entire anime by herself.",

            "content": "I wonder, what does it feel like to be able to travel all over the world and sit under the blue sky while making countless friends and acquaintances, and having a beautiful companion to witness all of it with you?  Now, what exactly is Spice and wolf and how does this question relate to it? Spice and Wolf is an anime that depicts the life of Craft Lawrence and his fateful encounter with Holo, a wolf deity who takes the form of a young, beautiful woman. Together, they travel across the land as traveling merchants with their goal being to be able to reachHolo\u2019s hometown, Yoitsu. So, what exactly is so special about this anime then? Well, to put it simply, Spice and Wolf is one of those rare gems that come along every couple of years or so. It is different from other animes in a way that it is of the romance genre, yet it shows it in a way that is quite different from others. That, along with a wonderfully written plot makes it a very unique anime that can both pique your interest and minds and at the same time give you the vibes that romance animes usually have. \\n\\n\r\nYou see, the plot is, as simple as it sounds like, is actually one of the most complex and unpredictable plots I\u2019ve ever seen. The anime is subdivided into several arcs that each have their own separate story. Now, each of these arcs are seemingly simple and straightforward, but in reality, they can task your mind just by thinking about how things will end up. Each story has more twist and turns than a slum, like in one moment they are happy and smiling then suddenly one simple mistake and their entire situation turns upside down. it still manages to tie up everything perfectly though and is the way they solve these problems is what makes Spice and Wolf interesting. It makes use of economic principles(whether they are applicable in real life or just made up is beyond me) that can either amaze you or confuse you.  Also, along with these events are the messages that make Spice and Wolf into the anime it is. These messages are subtle implications about things like how money corrupts men, how untrustworthy people become when faced with certain opportunities and other things which may sound a bit philosophical. Then there\u2019s the romantic aspect of Spice and Wolf. I find it really entertaining yet very infuriating to watch the two main characters flirt with each other but their relationship seems to remain platonic. Sure, after a few episodes or so they start holding hands or so but other than that there really isn\u2019t anything else. This kind of flirting though does have a certain charm that makes me crave for more. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of craving more, I just can never get enough of Holo. She is one unique character that never fails to amuse; a beautiful, wise and quick-witted woman who has a distinct love for alcohol and apples. Then there\u2019s the traveling merchant Craft Lawrence, a bona fide gentleman who has a great way with words and is Holo\u2019s love interest. Every time these two are on screen alone, you can just be sure that a wonderful exchange of words is about to ensue. Along with these two characters are a bunch of other side characters that they meet in every arc then leave as they venture out. Unfortunately though, since only Holo and Lawrence are given enough screen time, only they are the ones with solid and unique personalities. Don\u2019t get me wrong though, the side characters are not entirely dull and boring or anything of the likes, you just can\u2019t really grow to love them as they don\u2019t really stick around for long. This kind of character development does kind of fit the story though as Lawrence and Holo are both traveling merchants so meeting a multitude of other characters does benefit the plot in some way or another.\\n\\n\r\nThen throw in a bit of wonderful music and sceneries and you\u2019ve got exactly what Spice and wolf looks like. The opening of this series, Tabi no Tochuu, is one of the most beautiful and emotional song I\u2019ve heard from an anime. Then there\u2019s also the ending, Ringo hiyori, which has a happy and energetic beat to it, and not to mention, it\u2019s in English, something you don\u2019t see everyday. The scenery is somewhat plain yet fitting to the theme of the storysSince the story of Spice and Wolf usually occur within cities. As such, most of the things you can expect to see are large brick buildings and markets cluttered by stalls with cloth roofs. When the occasion calls for it though, Spice and Wolf can surprise you with views ranging from vast wheat fields and rural sceneries that are based off medieval Europe to foggy, foreboding forests and quiet paths along the countryside. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Spice and Wolf has done a great job being unique and staying true to its concept. It never strayed from the story and had a very intricate and mind-boggling plot. Along with the romance going on between Holo and Lawrence, Spice and Wolf truly delivers type of entertainment that hasn\u2019t been shown in any other anime. it tries to both tease the mind by putting the characters into complicated yet conceivable situations and charm the heart by slowly developing the relationship between Holo and Lawrence. It has been a fun watch for me and for everyone who is looking for an anime that has a well constructed plot and a sweet, mature love story, look no further because I am sure that Spice and Wolf will deliver.\\n\\n\r\nBtw, don\u2019t you just love apples?\\n\\n\r\n~First and foremost, thanks for reading my review. If you have any comments regarding my review or just want to have a discussion, then leave a comment at my page. I will greatly appreciate it. =)~\\n",

            "content": "Spice & Wolf is in essence, a fairly simple story. It\u2019s about a travelling merchant called Lawrence who one day while visiting a town comes across a young girl sleeping in his cart. He soon finds out that this is no ordinary girl. This is Holo the wise wolf, a pagan god who ensures good harvest for the village. Due to the spread of the new church (very similar to the Catholic Church) pagan beliefs are dying out and Holo has found there is no longer any need for her to be there. Lawrence reluctantly agrees for her to travel with him as she headsnorth and back to her homeland.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main aspects of the story is the development of the characters Lawrence & Holo, how their relationship evolves and how they deal with the challenges that face them. The story also comes with a dose of economics and in many ways you think this shouldn\u2019t work, but it really does. Lawrence takes calculated risks which don\u2019t always pay off and along with Holo they must find a way out without it costing their lives or leading to something worse (for a merchant) - bankruptcy. Holo is a complex character who is both wise and cunning but very stubborn.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story is slow paced with alot of talking, if you looking for action then look elsewhere. One of the joys of the series is the vocal sparing between Holo and Lawrence. You can see them becoming closer as the series develops and you find yourself rooting for them when they are up against it. The story also follows the books quite closely which is always a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nHolo has the ability to transform into her wolf form if needed but thankfully there are only a couple on instances where this is needed which only adds to the drama and tension as Lawrence\u2019s money making schemes go sour. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very good and the character designs are excellent. A special mention needs to go to the English dub which is one of the best I\u2019ve ever heard. The music is pretty good and compliments the medieval environment the story is set in. \\n\\n\r\nSpice & Wolf is perfect example of a character driven story. The second series focuses more on the romance side and is even better than the first. Holo is one of the strongest female characters in any anime I\u2019ve seen and Lawrence is a competent and intelligent character too. If you\u2019re after a great romance with strong characters and gripping story then you won\u2019t get any better than this. Both series are an absolute joy. The only issue is that they only made two series, we need more. If you want to continue the stories after the anime the books are great as well. I would recommend picking it up from Volume 6.\\n\r\nIn conclusion this is one of the best amine\u2019s I\u2019ve seen and is just fantastic from start to finish.\\n",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf was decently rated at the time this review was made and I feel like writing about it so let's get to it. I'd like to start with the question is Spice and Wolf able to measure up to this for everyone? Let\u2019s talk about that in this review!\r\nSpice and Wolf is different in terms of pacing, character interaction, and settings from a lot of anime, however, I think the character interaction is probably the most noticeable. It is more conversation over action based and way wittier than a lot of anime. This makes Spice and Wolf a little more interesting as manyanime can be a little too direct or blunt when characters speak to each other. Even the characters themselves ask for elaboration during conversation and the way the dialogue is written does not really make anything feel like indirect exposition, so it\u2019s pretty well done.\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf's action scenes are very spread out and not very long. The action scenes are ok but nothing too crazy. You can feel the focus was not exactly on these scenes, but the buildup does make them feel pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting can throw you off if you are not a big fan of historical looking things like castles, horses, or carts. Honestly though what is there to say, you either like the setting or you don\u2019t here. It is a mostly overall realistic setting other than the part where Holo is a wolf deity thing. They use (ab)use the setting for conversations between the characters, I guess that was easily expected though right?\\n\\n\r\nLet's go back to the question I asked at first, is Spice and wolf for everyone?\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest the first time I started watching this I did not really watch that long. I made it to about the 5-6th episode before quitting. Then lately I restarted from the first episode again and it felt different this time for some reason. I did enjoy it this time around and wanted to write a review because of this.\\n\\n\r\nI think the most important thing to realize this anime has to grow on you. It's not what you are probably used to watching due to how the anime goes along. If you start to get into the conversation, exploring, and exploits they have together it really is a good watch.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, try it for yourself and see what you think.",

            "content": "This review is based on both seasons of Spice and Wolf.\r\nFor such a shameless furfag as myself, it certainly took a long time before I got to watching Spice and Wolf; an anime where one of the two protagonists is a cute wolf girl complete with bushy tail and pointy ears. Ending the procrastination paid off, for besides indulging a geeky fetish Spice and Wolf (or Wolf and Spice, ha ha) offered some semi-educational dialogue, intriguing characters and interaction and, perhaps most importantly of all, plenty of heartwarming and easy-going entertainment.\r\nTo start off, folks who've usually preferred cyberpunk-, scifi-, or any such anime with modernmilieu will find themselves challenged in case they decide to pick up Spice n Wolf, for a tower clock and a simple scale are among the most hi-tech inventions you'll see in this show. Set in a rural world where church is the highest authority and deities the trusted insurance for good harvest, most of the shows atmosphere indeed leans on the classic feel attached to any tale set in the past times. How well would've Horo's charm fared had she dressed in a miniskirt and a top instead of the archaic and more concealing attires she wore? Or hid her ears with a flipped baseball cap instead of the granny scarf and hood? What would've become of the shows emphasis on hers and Lawrence's long and time-consuming travels together had they been done with a sports car instead of a horse cart? To fully appreciate the overall languid nature of the show is to either like the type already or bite the bullet and see if you can stomach it. My place is in the former category, so no need to guess whether I consider the slice-of-life-ishness good or bad.\\n\\n\r\nThose of you who enjoyed works such as Death Note, Eden, and FMA because of their fascinating storylines will have to prepare yourselves to try and find something else enjoyable in Spice and Wolf. As most of you propably deduced from the previous paragraph, S&W is yet another one of those shows that just doesn't have a single storyline that'd last throughout the whole show, unless you'd like to count wolf girl's and Lawrence's constant traveling as such. The two of them travel to one place, deal with whatever conflict they encounter there, move someplace else and repeat. It's as simple as that, and if this kind of plotline (story arcs following one another) hasn't appealed to you before, it likely won't do so this time either and vice versa.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with the show clearly not trying to make too much of an impression through plot or an exciting genre, it is only natural that the series's main spice should lie in the characters. Namely, Horo and Lawrence. Even more namely, the chemistry between the two. The towns that they visit change, the people they meet on their journey change, the only constant is their interaction. Be it friendly bickering over matters more or less trivial, bitter arguments when differing opinions collide more drastically, or, on the rare case, completely serious discussions ranging from pure business to deeply personal issues. Whatever it is, the two are always going at one another (though sadly not in the more physical sense), and ever so slowly, unsuspectingly under their very noses, their relationship begins to deepen. It does so through hints subtle at first yet obvious later on, resulting in no sexual encounters nor outright confessions, for better or for worse, that is left for the viewer to decide. Personally I found myself missing some romance past the awkward fumblings and perhaps some sort of continuation after the discovery of their mutual feelings. Perhaps the original light novels, manga, or possible future anime projects may offer gratification on this issue; it is left for those interested to find out.\\n\\n\r\nThe aforementioned \"semi-intellectual dialogue\" steps into play in the aforementioned rare cases of serious business talk. I doubt any PhD level economic science is discussed (though I can't be sure since I'm no professional), but Lawrence's occupation as a merchant and the resulting trade thematics in the show are not to be downplayed. Rarely an episode passes without the viewer witnessing at least one in-depth analysis of a specific trade technique, the importance of good relations, the gravity of knowing currencies and their values and the foul play associated with them and anything else trade related and...well you get the point. Some might find these little lessons fascinating, others will be bored to tears. I stood somewhere in the middle ground, though generally the longer the talk, the less I focused.\\n\\n\r\nA bit of a checklist at the end. Slice of life? Check. Story centered around two main characters and their interaction? Check. LOTS of dialogue? Check. Crapton of action a la Black Lagoon and Gurren Lagann? Sure Horo and Lawrence stumble upon conflicts that escalate beyond a little disagreement between bestest buddies, but otherwise, no. Drama rivaling that of top ten western soap operas combined? Sure they have their small quarrels with even some love triangle thrown in at times, but beyond that, no. What Spice and Wolf is essentially about is two people slowly finding one another through time and talk, and that's that.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and perhaps most importantly of all, a cute furry girl with a wicked attitude? CHECK! ;)",

It would not be far fetched to say that this is the pinnacle of them all, byoverall story, by overall character development,  by overall execution of the story and by execution of light novels into anime while story staying intact. P.S. : 2 seasons only consist 2 books,1st to 5th 4th being excluded. And whole book series have 17 books, leaving are much more books to animate... This is what a \"Masterpiece\" is.",

However, even if you have only the slightest interest in economics, please enjoy.\r\nSpice and Wolf is a more slowly paced anime than what I'm used to.  There's a little action; but its not action heavy.  There's a little romance; but its not sickeningly saccharine. Its really just a good anime about a traveling merchant and a wolf spirit who was once revered as a local God. It's so sweetly simple.\r\nWhat interests me most about this show is that the characters, both individually andas a pair, are incredibly fleshed out.  As individuals, both characters have interesting goals that motivate them and distinct personalities. As a pair, they are even more interesting. The two make a dynamic duo who's interactions are genuinely fun to watch. \\n\r\nIt seems like the creator of the anime wrote about people with with lives rather than a story with characters. That is SO REFRESHING, you have no idea.\\n\r\nThe best compliment I can give Spice and wolf is that its just a good story, which is high praise in my book.",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf is one of those series I heard everyone and their mother talking about, and honestly, it didn't look that appealing to me. I finally decided to watch it, to be honest, to have something to write a bad review about to balance out good/bad reviews. After I started watching it though, and getting into the story and characters, I quickly fell in love with this series, even though it's one of those shows I usually wouldn't like or enjoy.\r\nStory:The story revolves around Craft Lawrence, a traveling merchant going from town to town selling and trading various goods. After leaving a town, hestumbles upon Horo, a wolf in human form who was considered a &quot;God&quot; by the local villagers, sleeping in his wagon on his furs. After listening to Horo's story, Lawrence decides to accompany her back north to her homeland. Though the story is overall great, there are a few minor things I had a problem with. Mainly the constant explanation of how the economy works, it tends to wear out it's welcome after hearing it several times. The suspense was the main point of the story that hooked me though. It might get slow at a few points, but for the majority of the series I was on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound: There really isn't much to say about the animation other then it was simply beautiful. Even the smallest detail like the faces on coins or the small rust spots on signs are draw with utmost care and attention to detail. The sound is equally impressive. Horo's howl gave me chills every time I heard it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: My personal favorite aspect of the series. Jun Fukuyama as Lawrence and Ami Koshimizu as Horo make the series their own with their outstanding performances. Add together a very good and well-rounded cast of supporting characters and it's any anime fans dream. Though I do feel some characters weren't as fleshed out and developed as they could of been, mainly Chloe and Norah. Norah did have a fairly big role, but I still feel there was so much more potential with her character. Chloe I though and hoped would have a fairly large role, but has no screen time at all for the entire second half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Honestly, I didn't have high hopes of enjoying this series when I started it, but I was very pleasantly surprised. I was sucked in from the moment the opening started (which is one of my top openings now) until the ending credits (which was somewhat of a letdown, unless theres a second season) Overall, would I recommend this series? Yes. It was very good and highly enjoyable, and thats coming from someone who usually dislikes series like this. Here's hoping there's a season 2.",

However, the artists did not add any \u201cgirly parts\u201d to these scenes so Holo has the body of a Barbie doll. Also, these scenes are done so tastefully that it isn\u2019t exactly fanservice. Now that that\u2019s out of the way\u2026\r\nSay hello to Kraft Lawrence, our witty protagonist in medieval times. Lawrence is a traveling merchant who sells a variety of things, and he\u2019s quite skilled in his\u2026er\u2026craft. Upon reaching the village Pasroe, he finds hidden in his carriage Holo. Holointroduces herself as the wise wolf deity who looks after the village to ensure that their wheat harvest is successful each year. Yet as time went on, the village began to resent her, and now Holo asks Lawrence to travel with him until she reaches her original home. Eventually, after poor Lawrence getting quite the scare once he sees Holo\u2019s true form, Lawrence agrees and the two set off from the village.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all well written and they work well together, however Holo steals the show with her wondrous charm and ability to play off Lawrence\u2019s character. She is a god, and in every way superior to Lawrence or at least that is what her personality would lead you to believe. Kind yet haughty Holo isn\u2019t afraid to boast about her higher status or how wonderful her tail is and\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nYes, her actual tail you pervert.\\n\\n\r\nOf course she doesn\u2019t call herself the \u201cwise wolf\u201d for nothing and numerous times she is able to help out Lawrence in the economic half of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOh yes, economy plays a big part in Spice and Wolf, as most of the premise is based on Lawrence and how he can either outwit or find a way out of financial struggles. Don\u2019t let the premise of economics scare you away just yet. While a good amount of the show is based on economy, it does a good job of attempting to explain the jargon and the how and why of it so even a simpleton should be able to get the gist of the plot if they pay attention. However, they do need to pay attention, as this is also the huge bump in the road that could alienate many viewers.\\n\\n\r\nTo call Spice and Wolf\u2019s visuals impressive would be an understatement. The color palette is rich, and the environments are an absolute joy to look at. The music is no slouch either, as period instruments are to say the least charming. The soundtrack is vaguely Celtic and fits the slow portions well, but is able to speed up well when the situation calls for it. As for the dub all of it is good, but once again Holo (or in this case her voice actress Brina Palencia) outshines everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nWhat could be said for the first season can more or less be said for the second season, although a dub is not available just yet (it has been licensed though). However, if the first season could be surmised as 70% economics, 30% romance then the second season could be surmised as 60% romance, 40% economics. It's still as good as the first season, though.\\n\\n\r\nIs Spice and Wolf for everyone? Of course not, as the show is very slow moving and even if that doesn\u2019t turn the viewer off the economic jargon might. However, to those who do venture into this anime they will find rich characters, wonderful art and music, and clever story plots.",

My point is Spice and Wolf is perfect in every way possible.\r\nStory: \r\nMost anime's have some point in them where there's a lull in the story, or something annoying, basically anything to break the chain of events. This never happens! Everything in spice and wolf is relevant to the plot, so the spacing is great, which is crucial for a story like this one. Secondly, there is a romantic sub-plot in there, but unlike most animes it doesn't interfere with thestory, nor does it get annoying! I don't know what else to say.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music in this amazing, even though there really isn't all that much. However, the way it's used is kind of similar to how it's used in Ico or Shadow Of the Colossus, in that what IS there, and when it IS used, because of it's rareness, enhances the music's overall effect and contributes to the mood. Voice acting rocks too ^_^\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nHoro is the greatest ever.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nYeah, it's fun!

The majorityof the anime is filled with heavy dialogue and smart-witted dialogue and is the basis of Spice and Wolf's plot.\\n\\n\r\nLawrence and Holo's \"relationship\" as it were is expanded in this first season and for the most part it does show us how much Lawrence and Holo's friendship turned business partner to psuedo-love interest prospers through Lawrence's trials and tribulation in being a merchant of his trade and how he or Holo or both get themselves out of certain situations only improving their relationship even further. Those trials and tribulations goes from as petty as a merchant trying to rip Lawrence off in a deal to Holo's jealousy of other woman to full on betrayal of certain deals and worst yet their lives are on the line, these trials and tribulations by all means nudge you further and further into liking Lawrence and Holo both as individuals as well as a pseudo-couple.\\n\\n\r\nIf there were some problems in this anime that would be, if you don't like heavy dialogue animes, then this anime will quickly bore you, trust LA, LA in the first 3 episodes was kinda slow to start off with but thankfully it got ALOT better when the plot got a bit more serious but to this defence, LA does understand that the early episodes were at least trying to world build seamlessly with it's folktales and it's very real life economics that functions in Spice and Wolf's world and it succeeded in that front however because of this, the heavy dialogue would bore some people. You'd think LA would say that Lawrence being a bland main character would be one too not noticing Holo's advances or being the average nice guy, but no as LA said Lawrence has a solid personality himself and is ALSO trying to play mindgames with Holo (for fun of course) only somewhat strengths this relationship even further and him being the average nice guy ALSO nips him in the butt during the course of this first season as well, if only because of Holo's anger.\\n\\n\r\nLA does say this as Holo isn't pining for Lawrence when they first meet or Lawrence is utterly dense, these two characters being our main leads are plenty clever if one Lawrence needs to survive as a merchant and Holo being a wise wolf god of the harvest leading her own hand and being the ever sharp tongued harvest God she is and using her quick wit or her instincts to catch merchant's schemes in such nonchalant ways. Really what LA is saying is, for main characters be it Lawrence and Holo individually or together, they are really the ones pushing the plot forward ever single time and neither of them are bland or uninteresting characters, if you remove either one of them, it just wouldn't be \"Spice and Wolf\" anymore\\n\\n\r\nNow the economics exposition actually does function into a plot like this especially with Lawrence and Holo with how they outwits many of their fellow merchants and guess what, the fantasy economics of Spice and Wolf can be used in real life situation at best, the easiest being the many different valued currency of Spice and Wolf's fantasy world and how rumors of different currencies being used, the obvious deals Lawrence goes through as well as the supply demand of the items Lawrence uses as a merchant is prevalent that the fantasy economics is a mainstay of Spice and Wolf, whether you enjoy economics doesn't matter at least in LA's eyes, as it's HOW Spice and Wolf utilize real world economics and reinvent ways for it to be put into their fantasy world equivalent economics and how it functions in their world that interests and better yet when it gets more serious with Lawrence and Holo's current situation, when their in a bind or if it affects their partnership and guess what, it worked!\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by Imagin, LA would say the animation is consistent and decent even for the time of when it was released of 2008. The backgrounding was decent, the character designs were also decent but special props would probably go to Holo as she's the most exotic out of the entire cast and although this anime rarely has fight scenes, the fair few that did was tense to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, the majority of the voice acting was decent though the only noteworthy voice actor that LA was somewhat surprised by was Ami Koshimizu, as LA thought it was Mai Nakahara at first (what with her verbal tic and accenting, and yes LA knows Mai Nakahara actually voices Norah), still nonetheless if there were two MVP's in this anime it would be Jun Fukuyama and especially Ami Koshimizu as Lawrence and Holo respectively.\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf may have it's slight problems with pacing and it's heavy dialogue of quick wit, betrayals and deals however it is ALSO because of it's pacing and heavy dialogue that makes up Spice and Wolf as one of the smartest, quick witted, interestingly fantasy economics tale of a brilliant merchant and his companion that makes Spice and Wolf soo great.",

            "content": "In a nutshell (tl;dr):\r\nHumanity enjoys deceiving and showing its superiority over nature. In Spice and Wolf, farmers no longer pray to the caring Goddess Horo, because they know how to control harvest without her help. Horo became really sad, but could not abandon the village that she had promised to protect long time ago. One day, however, she is freed by a wandering merchant named Kraft Lawrence. The merchant knew that there was only one person with the name Horo and after a little test, the man agreed to travel with the witty Goddess. Spice and Wolf will take you in a wonderful journey ofmany smiles, as well as good feelings. \\n\\n\r\nDo you like strategy games as much as I do? It must have taken you a few all nighters to beat Heroes of Might & Magic 3, or Stronghold Crusader, have not it? Did you enjoy playing Sid Meier's Civilization? Do you think that the Middle Ages is the most beautiful, as well as interesting period in the history of humanity? If one of these if true for you, then you should definitely give Spice and Wolf a try, because this anime is one of these series you might fall in love right after the first episode. Spice and Wolf has 2 seasons, but I will only touch upon the first season in my review. \\n\\n\r\nOokami to Koushinryou (Spice and Wolf) short description:\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf is a Japanese light novel series written by Isuna Hasekura, with illustrations by Juu Ayakura. ASCII Media Works has published 20 novels since February 2006 under their Dengeki Bunko imprint. ASCII Media Works reported that as of October 2008, over 2.2 million copies of the first nine novels have been sold in Japan. The series has been called a \"unique fantasy\" by Mainichi Shimbun due to the plot focusing on economics, trade, and peddling rather than the typical staples of fantasy such as swords and magic. Yen Press licensed the light novels and is releasing them in English in North America. ASCII Media Works has published three volumes of a spin-off light novel series titled Wolf and Parchment since September 2016.\\n\\n\r\nA manga adaptation illustrated by Keito Koume began serialization in the November 2007 issue of ASCII Media Works' seinen manga magazine Dengeki Maoh. The manga was licensed by Yen Press, which has begun releasing the volumes in English. A 12-episode anime adaptation aired between January and March 2008, plus a single original video animation (OVA) episode released in May 2008. A second OVA was released in April 2009 as a prequel to the second anime season Spice and Wolf II, which aired 12 episodes between July and September 2009. Both anime seasons were released in English by Kadokawa Pictures USA and Funimation. Two visual novels based on the series for the Nintendo DS were released by ASCII Media Works in June 2008 and September 2009.\\n\\n\r\nHoro and Lawrence\\n\r\n\u00abSpice and Wolf\u00bb focuses on the story of a wandering merchant named Kraft Lawrence. The story takes place in the medieval period, at the time when danger was awaiting you at every corner and turn: outlaws, different deadly illnesses, and church, which was the number 1 issue for many-- a misstep and you become a heretic. Kraft Lawrence has been wandering for 7 years already, trying to earn enough money to open his own shop and to become a better merchant. When he leaves another small village to sell goods, he finds the Goddess of harvest in his wagon. Horo explains the merchant that people no longer need her help and are starting to forget about her: they neither pray to her, nor do they even remember about her lending a helping hand to them when they needed it. And after a little test, the merchant agrees to take the Goddess on his journey. Because who would refuse to have a Goddess on your side? (Kraft, you lucky bastard)!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThere are only two protagonists in the series--the wolf girl Goddess Horo and the merchant Kraft Lawrence. It becomes obvious right from their first meeting that they complement each other well, and this first impression will prove correct later on. Kraft Lawrence is calm, when Horo is quick-tempered, but they both care for each other. What I am trying to say is that both of them are very different, but they are also very similar to each other. And the reason for that is their loneliness, they both are aware of. As the series progresses, the protagonists will have to face many challenges that will test them. With that being said, I believe that with every new episode of Spice and Wolf, you might fall in love with this series more and more. \\n\\n\r\nHoro\\n\r\nHoro \u2014 is a local deity of harvest; her original form is a tremendous wolf. Several centuries ago, she came to the south from her homeland in the north. She agreed to protect the village\u2019s harvest. However, humans are ungrateful creatures that are unable to understand that even a deity is unable to control nature. With time, soil becomes exhausted and is no longer able to support crops or other plant life. But the villagers think that this is just the Deity\u2019s whim and blame her for everything, little by little forgetting about her existence. Having understood that people no longer need her help, Horo decides to return to her homeland. \\n\\n\r\nAside from that, Horo has two forms: the first being a giant wolf and her second is a 15-year old girl. Horo is fond of delicious food and alcohol, but especially loves apples. She takes pride in her tail and takes special care of it, constantly combing and maintaining it.\\n\\n\r\nWithout a single doubt, Horo is one of the reasons for success of this series. She might be one of the most interesting and beautiful female characters you will ever see. It is somewhat challenging to give a proper description of her character, because she is always different. She is very smart, her jokes are better than what you see in 90% of comedy series, she looks strong, but she also makes an impression of a fragile creature that you want to protect really baldly. She is always ready to help; a perfect companion a merchant will ever find. \\n\\n\r\nLawrence\\n\r\nKrawft is a merchant that hopes one day to open his own shop. At 12, he became a student of an experienced merchant; at 18 he started his journey to earn enough money to open his own shop. Since that time, he has been earning money for 7 years already, buying and selling goods in different towns. As a true merchant, he is trying to find profit in everting and refuses to accept unprofitable deals. When he meets Horo, he agrees to help her. Yet, in return, she will have to compensate for losses. Kraft Lawrence is very smart and crafty, but also very kind individual, which Horo dislikes about him. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough, there is nothing special about him, as a character, he makes a very positive impression. Mainly because of the fact that with story-line development, his character also changes. (Which is rare for some series). On top of that, you cannot say that Lawrence is weak: he is ready to stand up for those who are dear to him. Though, when the situation is dire, Horo will help him. That said, he is a very interesting character with his own principle and beliefs; his development is very interesting to follow. His cold, but also kind character complements Horo very well.\\n\\n\r\nPlot\\n\r\nThe plot consists of three main components: trade, action, and dialogues. Despite the fact that trade is often associated with something boring, in case of Spice and Wolf, the economics is presented in an easy-to-understand manner, and is explained in detail. This, as I think, makes the story-line even more interesting, but never boring. As a person who loves strategy games and especially everything connected with trade, I found elements of economics very interesting to follow. Although, many may disagree with me. Personally, I found it interesting to find out about many tricks that are connected with coining of money and how one can make a fortune using these tricks. Action scenes are the only drawback to find in Spice and Wolf; there are like two scenes in the whole 2 seasons. That said, if you are looking for some actions scenes, that is not the anime you should be looking for. But even without action scenes Spice and Wolf is able to prove that it is a masterpiece, a diamond, which is very difficult to find sometimes, because even without action, it is able to kindle your interest, which is a huge problem of many SoL series. \\n\\n\r\nHolo and Lawrence\\n\r\nThe most important role in the story-line, based on the economics would surely play dialogues. It is not surprising, because Spice and Wolf is based on the light novel, which was written by Isuna Hasekura. And as you know, this means that there will be many dialogues, and the success of the series will only depend on the quality of these dialogues. I must say that, for some reason, they work well. I cannot describe the reason why they work that well: the reason for that might have been an excellent work of the Japanese voice actors that voiced Horo and Lawrence (by the way, I would highly recommend you to watch it in Japanese with English subtitles, or insert your first language subtitles. The amount of the work the Japanese voice actors paid to their characters is simply amazing, Spice and Wolf is one of these series you should only watch in Japanese. But, of course, it depends on your likes and dislikes, so feel free to watch it in whatever language you want), maybe because of the superb dialogues, written by Hasekura Isuna. Another thing worth mentioning is that these dialogues are never annoying, because they give you all the needed information. However, sometimes you will still have to think based on the information you have about some things that have not been mentioned in the series. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nWithout a doubt, the series is somewhat old. (The second season has a much better art than the first series, simply an eye candy, by the way). However, one thing is obvious-- the amount of work paid to make every single frame look amazingly beautiful. Not only do characters look unique, but also their outfits, backgrounds; the whole series look quite enjoyable, because it is somewhat a challenge to capture that medieval feel in your work. Spice and Wolf animators, however, did manage to do it. \\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\r\nComposed by Yuji Yoshino, a Japanese composer who has done a variety of works in video game music, such as in .hack//Legend of the Twilight. He has also arranged a number of music collections for the Suikoden series, including Genso Suikoden IV Music Collection: Another World, some tracks of Genso Suikoden Celtic Collection 2, and all of Genso Suikoden Celtic Collection III, Spice and Wolf\u2019s OST is truly charming.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening performed by Natsumi Kiyoura perfectly illustrates how lonely both Horo and Kraft are. However, together they are not lonely anynore, they can overcome all the possible hardships they might face, and no matter how long their journey is going to be, they will still succeed. The ending theme displays the comedy part of the series and it is possible to say that it illustrates Kraft\u2019s and Horo\u2019s relationship. \\n\\n\r\nGrade:\\n\r\nOverall (dub) : c\\n\r\nOverall (sub) : A\\n\r\nStory : B+\\n\r\nAnimation : B+\\n\r\nArt : A\\n\r\nMusic : A+\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Spice and Wolf is a series worth watching, but it requires some patience in order to fully appreciate the pacing and complexities in the plot and in order to engage with the characters. Fans of SoL will highly appreciate every single detail in Spice of Wolf; there is nothing I can dislike, or criticize in this series. My only regret is that it did not get a third season. But it should not worry you, since you can always find light novel\u2019s spoilers on the internet.",

Featuring a strong female character, Holo the Wise Wolf, and a charming merchant, Kraft Lawrence, this anime explores the nature of self-discovery through travel and trade.

Regardless, the romance between the two characters is pure and certainly not shallow like many others.

            "content": "I was actually looking for something a less intense for what I'm usually used to. Spice and Wolf is one of those animes I find hard for anyone to actually hate unless your doing it on purpose or you really don't like settings placed in medieval periods.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nThe story seems very generic to me but I like the point of view they put the whole thing into. Its not set into your typical Knight in Shining Armor or peasant who just gets wrapped up in all of the mess. No its just told from an ordinary traveling merchant who decides to take matters into hisown hands. Its plot revolves around Holo trying to get home and Kraft promises to get her there. Well the only thing I really dislike about this idea is the subplot they add in there to add some development. However they do still keep your attention through all of it which some animes aren't very good at. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is actually very beautiful and fits nicely with the tone of this anime. Though it seems very common in animes of the decade so really it wasn't unexpected to have a style as such.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nAs for our music I really didn't like the ED. Just the sound reminds me of Christmas Carolers and pushes it. However I do quite enjoy the OP its really beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters in Spice and Wolf become very developed by the end of the season. I find it difficult to hate anyone in this anime unless you just don't like furries. However, it is pretty interesting to hear about merchants trade or wolf life every now and then. They really portray medieval periods well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10 \\n\r\nThis anime was quite something. Its not really an intense thing to watch so if your an action junkie this may not be for you. However its story and character development work out really nicely so if your in it for any of these or the adventure give it a watch, you won't be disappointed.",

            "content": "Ookami to Koushinryou is one of those shows that fall under the category of more complex/focused shows like Death note and Code Geass, where one really needs to focus on what is going on in a sense, in order to fully understand.  While personally, I could care less about that stuff due to my simple nature, I will say that I fully enjoyed this series to its fullest.\r\nStory (9/10): Spice and wolf, as this series is known in English, has, on one hand a rather simple plot.  The actual 12 episode anime is split into 2 arcs, where each of them correspond toa different problem that the 2 main characters, Lawerence and Holo, must overcome.  The reason why I say this plot is simple is for one reason only; its exposition.  The exposition and the meeting of the 2 leads is very easy to understand and done very simply and beautifully.  The majority of this series is done in this simple concept, and executes it very well with an easygoing plot line and its wonderful, glorious, banter.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Spice and wolf has another side to its simple traveling style, explained in the form of medieval economics.  Yes, the complicated part I was talking about at the beginning of this review, is reflected like this.  Because the series has a merchant for its main lead, the characters face economic situations and problems which...confuse me.  Personally, I hate it.  While watching it, I was always confused about what was going on when the economics part was occurring, to the point that I paused the show and read the subtitles, and still didn't get it.  The economics goes very deep, and to one who doesn't have any knowledge of economics, it can be a bit of a turn off.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story of Spice and wolf definitely has a solid plot that isn't too difficult to understand, (minus the economics), and doesn't at all feel droned out or carried out.  It picks up when it wants to, and slows down when it needs to.  It didn't feel boring at all, and I enjoyed all of it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10):  I just want to get one thing straight.  I...Love...Holo.  The wolf deity of the north is by far, one of the best female leads in all of anime history.  The reasons for this is because of just how awesome and wonderful she is.  She's flirty, mischievous, smart, etc.  Overall, she's a very complex character that cannot be put under the normal troupes for female characters that we all know.  She's an individual character that stands out so much, that she is by far, one of my favorite characters of all time.  Adding to her complexity is the fact that she has a hidden side to her, that just makes her all the more awesome and adorable, not to mention, more realistic in terms of an actual person.  I just cannot put into words just how awesome of a character she is.  \\n\\n\r\nThe series's male counterpart, Lawrence is quite awesome in his own way.  As a traveling merchant, he has innate knowledge of economics and plays the part as the one who sets up the plot for the series.  I find however, that most of his character is defined with Holo.  It's because of her that we get to see more of Lawrence, developing his character more, and allowing us to see sides we've never seen before.  The series focuses on the relationship between these 2, which makes them so much better, and adds so much good quality and merit to it.\\n\\n\r\nSide characters are arcic.  (I made that up.)  Meaning, similar to the word episodic, is that they all pertain to a certain arc.  Any character other than the main two, you will never see beyond the arc that they're in.  It's a bit strange that they just drop off of the face of the earth, but it's perfectly fine considering that they're not the main people that drive the story.  \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8/10 and 9/10):  The art for spice and wolf has a very rustic feel to it.  It features quite a bit of dull colors, reminiscing the olden european age of the renaissance age with wooden buildings, marketplaces, and oh so beautiful scenery.  The characters themselves are fairly simple in terms of clothing design, and fit very well with how this anime displays and shows itself.  The animation is very fluid, and overall, looks really nice.  It really sets itself apart from a large majority of animes, considering that the setting is in a completely diferent area.  Although, the animation can get a bit strange sometimes.  (there's a horse that derps around.  It was hilarious!)\\n\\n\r\nThe music.  Oh my god!!!  Personally, I think that Spice and wolf has one of the best soundtracks in anime history.  Its opening Tabi no Tochu is one of the most gorgeous things I have heard.  It's incredibly soft and soothing, with a bit of a depressed tone as well as some pick-ups, that works so well for this anime.  It fits incredibly well, and I love it.  Its ED is also very interesting and fun.  It's a short little song that contrasts its OP companion, with a fun little song that is sung in english.  It's very different and very fun to listen to as it has a very upbeat beat, and some pretty fun lyrics.  It's background music is awesome as well.  (To me, when background music in the anime sounds really good, you know the soundtrack is awesome.)  To compliment its medieval europe feel, the background tracks are split into 2 categories.  One, is a track with light and airy wind instruments for when the plot isn't serious, and a more string heavy song for when the anime picks up.  All in all, the music is gorgeous and I applaud the people who made and played them.  \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for both english and Japanese versions are wonderful as well.  Spice and wolf has a pretty good dubbed version of itself.  But personally, I would recommend the sub, only if either you're like me and prefer subs, or you really want to understand the economics of this anime.  Since it provides words that you read off over and over again when paused.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (9/10): While no, I'm not a big fan of economics, thus repeatedly getting confused with the whole financial situation, I found Spice and wolf to be a rather fun and good series to watch.  Spice and wolf hosted a pretty good and interesting plot, which I always love seeing, as well as how original it actually was compared to what we have these days.  There's a nice hint of romance which I can secretly ship, and overall, just wonderful, wonderful characters.  (Holo in particular.) I would highly recommend this show to anyone who would love an original and semi-serious plot line, filled with banter and golden conversations, and the occasional drunk goddess.  After watching this series, my only wish, is that I could have someone like Holo in my life.  Seriously, that would make life so much more interesting.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 8.92\\n\\n\r\nP.S.  Yes, I have watched the second season, and will write a review about it in the future.",

            "content": "SPICE AND WOLF REVIEW:\r\nMINDSET:\r\nUnique for Anime, but not so ambitious.\r\nSYNOPSIS:\r\nIn 1*whatever the date is in Europe* AD comes a travelling merchant (peddler) known as Lawrence, who all of a sudden saw a beautiful wolf Godess in he's cart at one night called Holo. Holo then managed to persuade Lawrence into taking her in he's cart, so she can get to the North. The two set off a journey filled with Drama, excitement, Tension and best of all... *drum roll* beastiali- I mean the two just sitting down and talking all day.\r\nREVIEW:\r\nTo be critical, I have re-watched some of the show for a bit of nostalgiaand the intense moments when Holo and Lawence being no longer together for a while has just lost its effect, since the tension has shorten into a predictable;e arch, any ways, the chemistry between the couple is so good that the show is probably going to hit sh*t ratings if they die too early. \\n\\n\r\nHolo and Lawrence are still one of the best romance couples I still know of to this day because Anime has this horrible tendency to make there couples either feel like one or two dimensional characters, or mass cloned from the Unholy Grail of 20th century Anime known as the Archetype Virus.\\n\\n\r\nThe chemistry (wait, thats quite an overused term when You describe couples in reviews, let me change it to get out of the clich\u00e9 plague a bit....) the writers conjuring alchemy blending the duo can make some really entertaining reactions, it has in some way a depth of realism, and Holo and Lawrence just simply being themselves as a happy couple is the biggest strength of the show, both in casuals, new fans, veterans, replay-value and the age of time will be given a pass for this.\\n\\n\r\nYes I am a Holo fanboy, and Lawrence, though fairly on par just doesn\u2019t seem to be Holo's more equal counter part (in terms of critical standards go)\\n\\n\r\nThe plot will not be as strong as it will it ever be, and side characters don't have a great deal of personality or exploration for us to care too much about them, and this is probably the biggest grype of the cast, Holo and Lawrence just easily out shines every character in terms of depth, personality, interactions, reactions, complexity and many other major factors. Sure, they are good side characters and some DEFINITLY, above average, however they do seem to have enough screen time to have nice grasp of there personality, though they seem to feel a bit too much like back drop at times.\\n\\n\r\nI have a good feeling that Spice And Wolf, depsite how different it is to a lot of Romance Anime still has small signs of its Anime tropes (what do You expect something to be made in the 2000's?) like the Shepherd Girl who seems to just be this really kind person and seems to act in this near perfect manner, or how Lawrence's apprentice shows signs that she is in love with him.\\n\\n\r\nWait, Lawrence has Holo, Chloey and Norah... and all of them seem to at least show some level of love interest to him.... Hareeeeem anyooooone?\\n\\n\r\nPlot conveniences are there, but they don't seem to go as far to be so distracting, like how Holo gets a new pair of clothes and how she always seems to get the best ones because 80% realosm ans 20% plot convenience, but such events don't seem to be annoying in any way shape or form.\\n\\n\r\nThough season 2 seemed like the same thing, going near the end we all got p!ssed when I was about to give the show a higher score! To be honest, there was nothing much to talk about season 2 except for that badly written ending and that there closer to the North.\\n\\n\r\nSomthing Spice and Wolf was infamous for was its use of describing economics instead of having Your boring History teacher, we have the Teachers animated! But, it does get tiring after listening a dragged out speech about economics that You soon forget about the next hour, fortunately, it does finally manage to fix that sort of pacing to be more tolerable soon enough.\\n\\n\r\nBrains Base seem to do a very well detailed job on immersing with its very clear and beautiful backgrounds, You see a healthy amount of orange flames emitted as light, a sharp blend of CGI and 2-D feel for most of the backgrounds (especially the old housing and infrastructure) though its very tolerable as it looks rather beautiful and still stands with modern day standards. Holo looks absolutely beautiful and the rest of the other cast seem to look decent enough, though the girls seem to be tad flashy.\\n\\n\r\nI watched the dub, and it feels like it has a mix between an American and British accent combined, You clearly cannot tell who is from this County of the UK and what kind of Englishman they are, but it still a damn great dub, each voice actor fits there voice amazingly, and  every sounds great. The music is mostly Folk with an upgrade, and has has this old European feel with its own modern twist from there compositions which is both unique and great! It also adds an accordion to the mix. The OP and ED songs are both great to listen to, and get You to the mood very nicely.\\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nI think the biggest all rounder for the series is something that I think many casuals have went into the misunderstanding that the show at its core is really just two travelling merchants as a couple stocking up on supplies each time they get closer to the North to find any living wolves happening to stay by. That alone is not some crazy and ambitious concept that will get a greatly high score if You know that the biggest strength is not the Drama and rising tension to a harsh climax, but one that seems to like the safer route a bit more has a sprinkle of its own harsh moments, but is not meant to make You cry or give You a heart attack. It is made to be a very calming, entertaining, joyful and overall not considerably great by from my definition. You see this show not to sob, or go f**king ape shat on a wet bra, but to just see to very entertaining pieces of chemicals reacting in a happy and cleverly sarcastic manner... Which is why giving a score of 9-10 is just silly!\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\n6.5/10- Holo and Lawrence = Amazing Couple, side characters are above average at best, and that's all.\\n\r\n6/10- The plot likes to stay at the safety area, but for a peaceful road journey that just there for the atmosphere, well done.\\n\r\n7/10- Great Animation Brains Base!\\n\r\n7.5/10- Great folk tunes guys!\\n\r\n6.5/10- Entertainment value is 85% to Lawrence and Holo, and the 15% can be anything, which is not all rounding.\\n\\n\r\nFINALE: 7/10!",

            "content": "Synopsis:\r\nKraft Lawrence, a traveling merchant looking for a beneficial trade to make, encounters a mysterious girl with the ears and tail of a wolf asleep in his cart. Later on, Lawrence finds out that that mysterious girl, Holo(Horo), is a harvest Goddess longing to return to her beloved homeland somewhere in northern lands, as she feels that the town has forgotten about her existence. The two make a deal leaving the village behind and start their new journey to the Horo\u2019s birthplace.\r\n-Story (10/10)-\r\nSpice and Wolf (Ookami to Koushinryou) narrates a story about lonely traveling merchant, Kraft Lawrence, looking for a beneficial trade to make. Onone of his journeys to the Pasloe village he encounters a mysterious girl with the ears and tail of a wolf asleep in his cart. Later on, the story reveals that that mysterious girl is the harvest Goddess called Holo(Horo) longing to return to her beloved home, since the Pasloe people have forgotten about the solicitous Goddess. The two make a deal leaving the village behind and start their new journey towards happiness and disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf is a medieval fantasy and one of these anime proving that a journey can actually be catching. Spice and Wolf\u2019s storyline mostly revolves around the day-to-day travels of a wandering merchant and his fascinating companion, Horo. The main problem of such anime is that it becomes boring after the first 2 or 3 episodes. By the way, Spice and Wolf has 2 seasons(25episodes), an OVA and two special episodes. It is quite long, isn\u2019t it? Here comes the question, why do people like it that much? The answer is simple, Spice and Wolf is called a masterpiece, because it is able to not only show you some relaxing scenes, but also make you worry, and believe me, Spice and Wolf WILL surely make you worry about a thing or two.\\n\\n\r\n-Animation (10/10)-\\n\\n\r\nWhile Spice and Wolf doesn\u2019t have a brand new animation to brag about, it still has its advantages: the animation perfectly displays the medieval setting (from landscapes to the ancient cities encircled with walls.) In addition to this, the attention paid to the colors can\u2019t left anyone unsurprised. Spice and Wolf\u2019s colors are simply bewitching. The series\u2019 cast, as well as their cloth, are also very beautiful to look at. \\n\\n\r\n-Sound (10/10)-\\n\\n\r\nI appreciate both English and Japanese dubs. Alas, the quality of the English dubbed versions, in most cases, is far from being bearable. Spice and Wolf does have a bearable English cast; however, in the Japanese version the main characters are voiced by Fukuyama Jun(Lamperouge Lelouch, Lute Ryner, Okumura Yukio) and Koshimizu Ami(Stadtfeld Kallen, Matoi Ryuuko), who did one hell of a job voicing their characters. If you are familiar with these two, it may be a good idea to watch it in Japanese. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was also very pleasant. Tabi no Tochuu by Kiyoura Natsumi and Ringo Biyori by ROCKY CHACK, will surely be added to your music list. Never annoying, both themes fit the anime well, not saying that the OST is splendid, as well.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters (10/10)-\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt is, indeed, a very important criterion for every adventure-based series and I must say that Spice and Wolf has managed not to fail that important task. It is truly a very difficult thing to do: to please both males and females and, somehow, this anime does it simply brilliant leaving absolutely no flaws. As stated in the synopsis, Spice and Wolf revolves around the two characters: Horo and Lawrence. \\n\\n\r\nHoro displays a dream of every man, she is the interpretation of beauty, she is fragile; yet, she is able to protect what is dear for her, she is wise, but sometimes she may make a mistake. It is truly captivating that Horo isn\u2019t a human; nevertheless, she is the most humane creature you will ever find in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nKraft Lawrence is more a strategist than a person who can easily fight against a bunch of people barehanded. However, when it is time to fight, he is ready to fight even a battle that will be impossible to win. Kraft Lawrence is a person who lives for the others.\\n\\n\r\nIn result, both characters are lonely and don\u2019t have a place to go to, but together they form a heartwarming duo, which will be surely interesting for both males and females, no matter how old you actually are.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment (10/10)-\\n\\n\r\nI honestly can\u2019t express my happiness, Spice and Wolf is one of these rare gems, which will leave a huge hole in your heart, as you, perhaps, will never find a show even a bit similar to what Spice and Wolf is.\\n\\n\r\nThe good:\\n\\n\r\n1)Story-line.\\n\r\n2)Animation.\\n\r\n3)Characters.\\n\r\n4)Music.\\n\r\n5)Enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad:\\n\\n\r\n1)The anime adaptation is unfinished and the probability of S3 is almost zero. (For more information, please, read the overall part.)\\n\\n\r\n-Overall (10/10)-\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf doesn\u2019t have a brilliant story to offer to its viewers; yet, it, somehow, proves that even a plain adventure may become something you will never forget about. It is a gorgeous show with very likable characters. It is a very deep show, which talks on such topics as: religion and people\u2019s nature. This anime is very calm; yet, it is also able to make you worry about the characters. Your heart will cry wanting to see the characters to be safe and sound, or being together. I guarantee you that you will never forget about this show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have never heard anything about Spice and Wolf and you think that giving it a try would be a good idea, you should keep in mind that Spice and Wolf\u2019s storyline is unfinished and the probability of S 3 is very low. But, don\u2019t be upset, it shouldn\u2019t prevent you from watching this splendid show. You can easily find a light novel on the internet, or if you are pressed for time, you can find a summary. Anyways, even being unfinished, Spice and Wolf is definitely a show, which deserves your attention.\\n\\n\r\n*Recommended audience: All. (Spice and Wolf does show nakedness; yet,it is very difficult to call it erotic. It's there, though, for those who care about it.)",

            "content": "The first time I saw Spice and Wolf, I took one look and decided it wasn't for me. After all, the main character appears to be a half-wolf half-human thing, and that's just not my thing. I like mature, romance stories, not super fantasy tales.\r\nI couldn't have been more wrong about Spice and Wolf. Spice and Wolf is one of the most mature, well done romances I have ever seen. I've seen more human emotion out of the wolf-goddess Holo than in half of the nonsensical tsunderes I see every day. I'm not typically a fan of fantasy-esque elements in anime; yet I never feltlike the fantasy elements of Spice and Wolf detracted from the main storyline. They were always present in the storyline yet never overpowering. From the beginning It was clearly a story of Lawrence and Holo and that never changed throughout the entire series. The budding relationship of Lawrence and Holo is what drives the story throughout season 1 and 2.\\n\\n\r\nAnother worry I had before watching the show, was that it would be too focused on \"economics\". You hear \"medieval economics\" all the time when reading about the show. I'm not particularly interested in economics or medieval life. However I found Spice and Wolf yet again to never overplay it. The plots revolving around money schemes and the daily life of Holo/Lawrence were always interesting. I never felt overwhelmed with strange terminology, or bored. It was the perfect mix.\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf wasn't without its one major downside though. And that's the fact that there wasn't a season 3. Spice and Wolf is the only anime to date that I've actually thought was worth reading the source material (light novels) afterwards. I was really blown away by just how much the Light Novels read like watching the show. It was 100% worth it to continue on and finish the story from the anime. The entire experience was brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nEven if the story just ended with the 2 seasons of anime though, it would be worth the watch. For fans of mature stories, of which there are so few that are well done in anime, Spice and Wolf is a MUST watch. Give it a chance if you're skeptical about its setting. It'll blow you expectations away.",

            "content": "I'll try and avoid going into fanboy mode because this anime turned out to be my best watch ever!\r\nIn a nutshell; A traveling merchant, after visiting a town to buy some wheat from. Happen to find out that a girl have snuck into his cart. But this is no ordinary girl. She is the wolf godess of harvest in her human form. After turn of events and bargains they accompany each other to an adventure that will take them to several cities and alot of drama!\r\nIn my opinion. Medieval times with a focus on mercantile like open market, coin values, trading and haggling just can'tgo wrong. And this anime executed it very well. Quite an original story line, using an unoriginal plot. Guy meet godess. It's done before but this is out of the ordinary. There is no 5 meter long sword or fire balls or dragons, this is quite a \"real\" medieval world. The church do taxes for many things and are one of the big powers. Trade guilds compete with each other etc. It's so many good things packed into one punch. And to be a short anime of 13 episodes, it really felt like i watched a 26 episode anime. I'm amazed how much they were able to put into 13 episodes!\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very good. People are drawn good, especially main characters and important minors. But sometimes background audience looks like paper figures which kinda ruins it but at least they are not a big bunch of black blobs. You can see that there are humans there. And when our heroes are not in a town and traveling, you have a gorgeous nature scenery and the cities and buildings are drawn very good. The world is not too bright but not to dark either, they did nice colouring on this.\\n\\n\r\nSound effects are good, i can't recall any specific but the music in S&W is amazing! The music managed to put you in the right mood and the opening theme gave the the goose bumps everytime! The ending was a nice little brake from the intense episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters have details on them and each character is unique, how the protagonist have grey eyes and hair and a brown leather jacket and being soft hearted yet the greed of a merchant and how he must balance those and find out if he is in love her or the money. How the wolf girl have red eyes, fangs and orange/white fur and being selfish but helpful at the same time. And they also have unique personalities which was a joy. The voice actors did a great job on the characters. You get a great connection to the characters and i found them all likeable, although the male protagonist is a idiot sometimes. Which can result in facepalm moments or \"Damnit! why didn't you do it?\".\\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment. This was amazing! As mentioned this turned out to be one of my favorite animes and best marathon watches i've done! You have plot twists and drama on par of death note quality. The art is very well done although some background characters turn to paper. The music score in this is amazing as well! The opening makes me want to cry but it has that hidden joy in the song which prevents me from doing so. Characters are deep and great! Each one of them is unique and how they react and handle in situations is interesting. You get tied closely to the characters and you can feel them when something happens.\\n\\n\r\nIf medieval times is a thing for you, like games or just stories. You should definately check Spice and Wolf out. This is not a fantasy medieval world with swords, fireballs, elves and dragons. You have normal people in a harsh and realistic medieval world where the church collect the biggest taxes for helping the poor and trade leagues competing and how easy it is to be backstabbed or tricked into a trap if you are careless and how valuable it is to have a guild or friends to run when things go really bad. Trading, haggling and market value is a big part of the anime but it's done interesting. If economics is a thing for you this will be a great bonus. The relationship between the male protagonist and wolf girl is a slow one but it's there. There is alot of dialogues so if you enjoyed animes like death note, you will love this i'm sure of it!",

            "content": "I'll be honest: I absolutely loved Spice and Wolf. It took me a long time to buckle down and watch it, but once I did, I couldn't stop. I can't believe I skipped over it for so long. You see, I was in this romance anime phase where I would exclusively watch school-based anime. Gross, I know. I'm still a bit infatuated with school-romance anime, but that has more to do with me currently being in high school and having a soft, guilty romantic side to me. With that in mind, Spice and Wolf is my favorite romance anime yet.\r\nWhen I looked at the synopsisand noticed that the main character was a furry, I teetered between watching it or forgetting all about it. I watched around four or five other animes after noticing Spice and Wolf for the first time. Each time I finished one, I'd browse MAL for another to watch, skimming over Spice and Wolf with a tortured glance. It looked boring, with the premise being a traveling merchant meeting some furry off in the wilderness. But something about it caught my eye. I can't quite explain what, though if you clicked on it in a similar manner then you've most likely felt the same. \\n\\n\r\nOnce I began watching, as I said earlier, I couldn't stop. The first episode entranced me (though I always thought the ending theme was out of place). The interactions between the characters were flawless, and the dialogue felt natural. The characters were portrayed perfectly, with just the right amount of flaws to go with their otherwise story-book personalities. The main character isn't your usual romance anime main. He isn't dense as a rock with no redeeming qualities that make you question why the girl falls for him. He can be dense, but that's explained in his cautious nature. He theorizes and questions everything, looking for ways to make a profit. Because of that, he tends to fop when it comes to general interactions. \\n\\n\r\nThe female lead is stunning as well. She isn't dainty or clumbsy, always tripping over her feet in a haphazard attempt to look cute. She's arrogant, witty, and mischevious as well. Yet, while lacking the general cute tropes, she still comes off as one of the cutest characters I've dealt with in a romance anime. It has to be the eyes. Or I'm a furry. I pray to God Hand that I'm not, but you never know...\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Spice and Wolf is fairly easy to get into. Some audiences may not understand everything that goes on, but it's enjoyable for just about everyone. It's one of the few series that I am willing to rewatch and pray for a new season to eventually be released. The only other time I've wanted a continuation this badly is with Natsume Yuujin-cho, and that one has met those expectations. Hopefully Spice and Wolf follows suit.",

            "content": "Ookami to Koushinryou(or Spice and Wolf), is one of the best romance animes out there, it has a nice rate here on MAL, and it deserves it. It has one of the best character i've ever seen (Holo) which made this anime really unique and fun to watch. \r\nThis review if for the both seasons. \r\nShort review: \r\n-Nice plot, original, simple, beautiful. \r\n-Nice main characters. Especially Holo, great look, great development. \r\n-Enjoyable soundtrack. It fits with the action, but there is nothing memorable here .. \r\n-Reasonable art, the character detail is nice, although the background detail is weak. \r\n-Overall: 8/10. Nice lovely romance story, withsome interesting talks about economy. (i mean they really are interesting, even if you don\u00b4t understand anything about it you will get to it) \\n\\n\r\nNow more detailed, \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10. This is a fantasy anime, and in fact it has it. But only in our main character, Holo. She is a wolf that can be in human form if she wants to. She is some kind of god of wheat (at that time, wheat was really important for civilization). The story takes place at 600 DC,  a time were being merchant was a comun job. The other main character, Lawrence Craft is one of them. When all of a sudden, Holo appears in front of him, they start a journey together, helping each other with the problems that they are going to face. \\n\\n\r\nI found no plot holes, and all the things related to economy are really well explained so i belive even if you don\u00b4t understand much about it, don\u00b4t worry i didn\u00b4t understand either but this anime taught me a lot of things about it :) \\n\\n\\n\r\nAs i said, the plot is really simple, nothing deep. Yet for being so simple it gets nice. At least i felt that way. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10. Well  only the characters look nice, not the best art but at least nice design. They are well shaped, with bright colours that fits with the anime. The only bad problem may be the background, it looks pretty bad sometimes.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10. Pretty much a normal sound, makes the romance moments intense, the rest is meh we can accept it well. The music fits better with the time when the action takes place. I mean the music has the same style as the music of that time. So it gives a nice enviroment. The openings are beautiful and in my opinion, they fit well with Holo's feelings and with the romance between our main characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10. We only have 2 characters with development. Holo takes the first place, while Lawrence gets behind, he does not have much development as Holo had but still it is a nice one. \\n\r\nThroughout the anime, we get to know how Holo feels about everything, i mean they explore pretty well this character which for being so cute and so funny gets super interesting to see her development. She is a mixed of emotions and feelings. Or she is fragile, or she is strong. Plus she is wise and teach a lot of things about the world to Lawrence, while he teaches things about humans as well to Holo(because she didn\u00b4t had much contact with humans). On top of that, the slow progressive romance between them both makes the anime pretty cute and also we can see a excelent development in their relationship, which is just lovely. Personaly, i loved that aspect. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10. We can divide this anime into mini arcs. Every arc takes place in one city, and there is always a problem to solve. And between those arcs or even in the middle, we have my favorite part, the development. It is just amazing the way that they talk to each other. We get to know everything about them both, and it is just amazing. I felt something that i've never had felt before, so this anime for me became memorable ! Their dialogues are at the same time intense, cute, dramatic, or simply all of that together. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this show is a lovely show with a cute main character and i belive for who likes romance, this is one that you need to check out.",

            "content": "After hearing so much about \"Spice and Wolf\" and how many people consider it one of the best anime around, I finally sat down to watch the first season. Having done so, I must say that I am surprised just how enthusiastic some reviews of this show have been. Personally, I thought this show was...good. Just that. A good show to casually watch and enjoy, but hardly a show that would stick out to me among many others. \r\nHere are a few reasons why I did like the show...and a few reasons why I wouldn't rank it as highly as some other people have done:\r\n-The show is often praised for its unique story concept, fusing a bit of romance with a plot about medieval economics...however, I thought it was a bit of a shame that the economic aspects of the show, which are such a central aspect, were primarily aspects that ONLY apply to economics in medieval times, thus being of little relevance or interest to a modern viewer, unless someone is specifically interested in history for history's sake. In comparison, another anime about medieval economics, Maoyuu Maou Yuusha, featured general economic issues about how to build a state or an economy that are still relevant today, which made the plot a lot more interesting in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n- The character of Holo, a transforming wolf deity, is certainly unique...however, it is therefore a bit disappointing that her personality is often reduced to that of a generic tsundere character. That's often fun and cute and all, but it doesn't quite fit the idea of an ancient wise godess. Maybe that's why she constantly has to remind the audience explicitely that she is indeed the wise wolf Holo. Still, despite her tsundere mood swings, her intelligence and wolf-abilities make her a fairly interesting character.\\n\\n\r\n- The relationship dynamic between Holo and Lawrence is thankfully always interesting and pleasant to watch...but, on a negative note, it is one example of how this show does not transcend many other typical romance anime. The characters and the relationship is nice...but not that unique. Similar relationships with similar back-and-forth dialogue can be found in several other anime. Still, it's never annoying or boring to watch, thus making it still a good experience.\\n\\n\r\n- The medieval setting and the soundtrack are certainly worth a watch...even if the animation is fairly average.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I think hardly anybody who watches Spice and Wolf would be disappointed with it. It's a good show and 13 enjoyable episodes fly by fast. It's just that, out of a bunch of several other \"good\" anime, I would know no reason why it should be considered to stand out in any significant way. Many other anime seem to be just as decent as this one. Good, but not spectacular.",

I watched Ookami to Koushinryou as one of my first anime series and I fell in love.  I can't rate this lower than 10/10 because it is what got me hooked on watching more and more anime.  Everyone has their first, and this just happens to be mine.  Now, it's not 10/10 only because it was my first, to this day I could still re-watch this and call it 10/10 because of its beautiful artwork, sound, and extremely relatable characters.  Ofcourse I don't live in a medieval fantasy world, but the relationship between the characters is that of people I know in my life.  This review may not be the most descriptive, but I hope in helps someone in the slightest.",

She has looked after the grain fields of a village for thousands of years. But now, she has a wish. She wants to go home. To the north.  To do this, she recruits the help of friendly merchant Lawrence, who's dream is to open his own shop, by forcefully stealing way into his cart. her soul inhabits the grain that Lawrence bought at this village. As payment for taking her North, she offers tohelp Lawrence make enough money to open his own shop.The two begin a journey to the north, along which Lawrence attempts to make money using his trade. Together, the two travel from town to town meeting varieties of people, becoming closer to one and other, and running into a kind of trouble different from the usual anime conflict. Financial trouble. This anime has little to do with violence and fighting for friendship. Instead the conflict is based on any financial trouble Lawrence and Horo encounter, from the change in the value of coin, to buying goods that are actually worthless. This anime is more about the journey than the destination, and it is an incredible journey. \\n\\n\r\nDON'T DISMISS IT YET! This anime is nowhere near as boring as what i just said sounds. This is one of the few intellectual anime that you will really ever find. Despite there being a wolf, there is next to no violence in this anime. Instead, it is replaced with Horo's adorable way of talking and her sharp wit. The two constantly compete with one and other in a love hate relationship. It is amazing to watch the way these two characters interact with one and other.\\n\\n\r\nI watched this anime while i was taking an economics class, and I swear i got an A because of it. The thoughts and concepts this anime portray are so accurate that the creators deserve an ovation for properly explaining and implementing such complex concepts ideas into a anime without being boring.

            "content": "This anime has a gripping story, great characters, and a fantasy world that isn't like your average fantasy world with magic  and fantasy species, in fact its a lot like our medieval world with one exception, which is in fact our main heroine, Holo. \r\n   Actually, Holo is one of the main reasons why i love this anime so much, shes sly and smug, but also quirky and sometimes blissful. She's extremely intelligent and a quick-learner, but is often prone to child-like attitudes, and awe-struck wonder to some of the simplest things. \r\n   Holo is one ofthe reasons why this anime stands so high for me. Don't get me wrong Kraft Lawrence is an amazing character as well and often his veteran merchant-like attitude offsets perfectly with Holo's more childlike demenor, its just that Holo is such an unpredictable character that you never know when she might pull a rabbit out of her hat, or use her silver tongue to talk herself out of purgatory. Holo seems to be able to make even the most boring trip from one town to the next out to be an exciting adventure. As for the world it does a great job of immersing you in it as well as giving you both background and information so that you feel like you understand the intricacies of the world. Even the opening to the anime by Natsumi Kiyoura is such a good song that it simply send shivers down my spine when i listen to it. \\n\r\n   However I don't necessarily feel like this is an anime for everyone. As I describe it, its \"half anime, half economics\" and often comes off as being a bit slow and having little in the way of action. The anime is heavy in dialogue and if you watch anime in the original Japanese with English subtitles like I do, it also means a lot of reading.  \\n\r\n   Still, the characters, the story, and the atmosphere all come together so perfectly that it is a great master piece in my book. That is why it is my 2nd favorite anime series of all time.\\n\r\n(PS: I listened to Tabi no Tochuu (the Opening from the anime) while I wrote this review)\\n",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf represents a very interesting and unique outlook on relationships. It's not a surprise however that an anime expressed through use of a time period in which people still pray to pagan Gods could appear to be boring to some watchers. As an individual who enjoys animes that can transport oneself to an intense space battle or see characters face immense challenges with their supernatural powers I was a bit skeptical taking this slice-of-life journey about a traveling merchant and a wolf girl. Obviously I was overjoyed to find this masterful gem.\r\nAlthough I can imagine most watchers believing Spice and Wolf being onlyabout their relationship growing while their wealth of money and experience grow as well. I would not argue with this thought but I would have to say that it is much more than that. Kraft Lawrence, our main character and expert merchant, is kind-hearted individual who doesn't mind getting his hands a little dirty in the name of business. In fact he even goes as far to tell Holo the Wise Sage Wolf, his companion, that all he thinks about is his business and dream to own his own shop. Watchers learn much about the ways of negotiating, bartering, and trading as well as techniques that border on absolute cunning. What makes Spice and Wolf unique is that the more we learn about merchant trading the more we see that relationships are the same. The bond between Holo and Lawrence perfectly illustrates the lessons in love and trading. With each town they travel to they experience different hardship that is linked not only in trading but in romance. Throughout their journeys we see actions of greed, selfishness, and risk applied to both of Lawrence's relationships: trading and Holo. This is clearly represented through their long dialogue and without understanding the connection between the two can leave watchers confused and bored. Overall, Spice and Wolf's story line is simple but full of emotion that makes you longing for more.\\n\\n\r\nThe art work is basic for being produced in 2008 but it might have been on purpose to further represent the older time that the story takes place. Either way it doesn't affect the watchability of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nI lose complete interest in an anime when the personality of a character changes throughout the story, especially when the characters are older. Character growth is extremely important to any good story. What did the character learn? How have they grown to meet the various challenges they faced? Becoming more courageous or becoming bolder are characteristics that can change easily through various events but personalities stay the same - it's who we are. In Spice and Wolf we see cleverly how growth changes how one makes decisions and expertly how their personalities remain true despite their many challenges. Perhaps one of the best reasons for selecting a (10) is the fact that the characters we love at the beginning, are the same characters we love in the end. \\n\\n\r\nI leave you with a simple conclusion - if you are one that watches anime purely for how it looks then this anime is most likely not for you. But if you enjoy listening to the several lessons that great animes contain then Spice and Wolf is a great place to look. The love is subtle and yet strong. If I could add anything to the wonderful work it would be to have seen a more  affectionate Lawrence. Although he clearly develops a strong bond with Holo that rivals even his obsession with his trade it could have been more clearly displayed to watchers waiting eagerly for that special moment.",

The story sounds kind of boring from reading the synopsis and the heavy use of currency exchange rates and bartering would turn off anyone who doesn't watch bloomberg, but somehow it all works here. Watching Holo and Lawrence traveling and getting to know each other and the world they live in is a joy. Their journey playing out as this strange romance with people that seem to have no chance at love and sticking together anyway.This is one of those must see shows that come around so rarely.",

            "content": "Well this is my first review and I watched this short anime with no real expectations and without reading any reviews, it turned out that I enjoyed this anime very much and I would recommend it to anyone who is sick of the usual rom-com or adventure story.\r\nStory: 8\r\nI thought the story although not amazing; was on the other hand very unique Ive never seen an anime like it and I am very pleased by it, first of all you have a traveling merchant which doesn't sound exciting whatsoever next you have a wolf god of the harvest or something silly like that. Anywho we'remixing it up by throwing that in there. After a little dispute with the wolf girl god person they end up travling together, doesn't sound like the kind of story that could stick me to my seat but it turned out to be more than meets the eye.\\n\\n\r\nAfter a few episodes the show turns into something different something that a younger audience or the type of viewers that don't like much dialog with their anime sandwich would be turned off by. I found out in actuallity this was an interesting concept. Alot of Dialog about economics and trading. But for people who do want a bit of action with their anime, there is a few episodes where the action actually put me at the edge of the seat and I was worried about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 \\n\r\nThe art is not amazing by any means but its not terrible either, it gets the job done some people dont like it and at times I found the shape of the peoples faces to be kind of annoying, for example at times I thought Horo was cute and then at others times I just thought she was weird looking, maybe it was just me.\\n\r\nAnd for a relatively second-class studio, I must say, Imagin has done surprisingly well making this series look good. The scenery in particular is beautiful, and makes the world so much more vivid and immersive.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 \\n\r\nI actually didn't know until looking at the credits that Jun Fukuyama was doing the voice for Lawrence, it turns out that his voice is very good and I didn't get the impression I was watching Code Geass at all. Jon did a swell job at making Lawrence sound real, and at the times when emotions would show I felt that he did a great job making it seem realistic.\\n\\n\r\nAmi Koshimizu on the other hand had a recognizable performance and the whole time I listened to her speak I couldn't help but think of big boobed Kallen form Code Geass.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was simple it seemed but it did a good job of setting the mood for the story and also I enjoyed the music from the op, although I felt that the ending music was a bit odd I never listened to it more than once just to listen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters were pretty well developed for a 13 episode show.\\n\r\nLawrence appeared to be a normal guy doing a normal trade and he was a rather boring guy which was sort of apparent in the first episode. Of course as the characters develop a bit Horo does a good job of bring out his fun side along with being a fun character herself who always tried to keep the show amusing when it started to get dull.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between the two was realistic at least it seemed so to me via the way they were arguing and constantly teasing each other it reminded me of a realistic thing and that's most of what kept the show great.\\n\\n\r\nOther than Lawrence and Horo there wasn't any special recurring characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nTruthfully I found this show to be extremely enjoyable, I would recommend it to anyone who has the patience to watch it develop personally I watched it all between a two day period and I only stopped because I got tired in the first place. The ending left a lot to be desired but obviously since there is a second season coming  those desires will hopefully be fulfilled. Yup Im excited for the second season.",

            "content": "What happens to the gods when people stop believing in them? Do they disappear, or simply go back home? While finding a person you love, is \"forever\" a simple word?\r\nThis is, simply, a story about a merchant travelling and selling goods, trying to get by the best way possible, with a little fantasy put in as his companion is a pagan goddess, trying to get home. The story is simple, at the same time deep and complex, it relaxes you while making you think. Being composed almost completely out of dialogue, it never becomes repetitive or boring.\r\nPeople, nature, rural buildings appearing around them while travellingare all done nicely. It creates a feeling as if you were there too, sitting in the cart listening Lawrence and Horo bicker. The only thing I didn't like is that the characters  were sometimes looking a little stiff.\\n\\n\r\nSound is perfectly composed with the nature of the anime. Voice actors, background music and the opening song were completely adapted to the nature of the anime, never sounding sudden or weird. The ending song makes me happy :)\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between the two main characters is progressive and subtle. From complete strangers, bickering partners then friends, it is completely natural that it would eventually turn into love.\\n\r\nListening to their conversation would be similar to imagining a ball flying from one to another end during a tennis match. There is passing, bluffing or playing cute, but, unlike many other couples, everything's completely honest and said out loud. Both of the characters say everything that's on their mind, be it embarrassing or maybe a little teasing.\\n\\n\r\nLawrence is a successful merchant, charismatic and smart. Still, he would be far from perfect. As every human being, he makes stupid mistakes and gets angry, despite being a \"nice guy\". Being much more mature than most anime mains, in the eyes of Horo, he's still just an innocent, little boy.\\n\\n\r\nHoro is a beautiful wolf pagan deity. She is much more cunning then Lawrence, she doesn't miss saying that to him, too. Despite being hundreds of centuries old, she still likes playing around, sometimes greeedy like a little child. Though, behind a playful smile, hides a past of centuries of loneliness, which comes out only in her most vulnerable times, when she's not strong enough to hide it.\\n\\n\r\nIt is funny, how most of the time the dominant role's being switched back and forth between the two of them. Being older and wiser, Horo often regards Lawrence as a little boy who just started learning about the world. At the same time, when she starts looking for food or is just being weak, Lawrence acts with her as if with a child.\\n\\n\r\nHistorical anime. If it's not unusual beasts and fantasy creatures, or knights, swords and fighting, then it must be a samurai story or at least an action with magic. It's nice to see anime that breaks out of a cliche at so many places.\\n\r\nRelationship is natural and warm, and the people feel alive.\\n\\n\r\nBeing one of my all-time favorites, and probably will always be, I enjoyed this anime a lot. :)",

            "content": "I couldn't pass over this anime to save my life. Being a big fan of Code Geass to see Jun and Ami as the main roles had me much excited to check out the voice acting in this one. I've also read the manga and loved it enough to bother going over the story again in the anime adaptation, you can pretty much tell how my review is going to be.\r\nStory - This anime takes place in a sort of medieval universe. Lawrence is a traveling merchant and dreams of opening his own shop in a town where he can settle down and have theprivileges granted from staying in one location to trade, such as finding a wife and having close friends. Being more specific with this anime's universe, religion is universally recognized as the highest power, beside gold and silver coins. Both of which are more highly regardless than the god of grain harvest Horo. Horo is a wolf but takes a human form and meets Lawrence. He makes a promise with Horo to take her up to the north forest in his travels of trade as he does so he learns about the many powers Horo has and how he can use them to benefit his trade. It seems more money is spent on keeping Horo content and happy than she helps make. Spending it on trivial goods as apples, clothes, and alcoholic drinks.\\n\\n\r\nBasically the plot is about Lawrence and Horo dealing with many business opportunities, some being very perilous, and there are points where it feels as all is lost for Lawrence.\\n\\n\r\nIt might sound either very dull or enjoyable, I warn you there is a ton of information to process and viewers will not understand why anyone is doing anything unless giving it their full attention. You must have a base understanding of economics. Even if you don't it's still watchable but it won't be as interesting as learning every side of the story. It's better to pick up everything as it goes on or you might not be able to find what you need by going back.\\n\\n\r\n9 - Yes there is a romance story, but we all know where that's going.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art was fantastic and captures the medieval universe very well. The clothing, people, villages, landscape, very much fit the archetype of the middle ages.\\n\\n\r\n8 - Beautiful, much to stare at as they talk about business matters.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Goodness did I enjoy the voice acting in this one. The long dialogue was done professionally. The BGM was very enjoyable, there was a sort of cheery flute music that I favored. The OP doesn't sink it at first, but as you keep hearing it, you find it to be a soothing and rather beautiful song. The ED I enjoyed a slight more, the accents for the English lyrics, I will never be able to emulate. It's a cute song really, something out of a children play. Expect some great howling and voice acting.\\n\\n\r\n8 - long explanations, no problem.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Being about a traveling merchant Lawrence never gets to spend much time with anyone in the span of the anime. Besides Horo, all the other characters are in it for their respective arcs and never feel as important as Horo or Lawrence. What's important is that they focused on the two characters that matter the most. You learn a lot about both and learn to love them both.\\n\\n\r\n8 - To describe it, I would compare it to a very small but delicious plate of high class cooking. You wanted more but at the same time fear that it might spoil the Horo/Lawrence combo.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - While never having to pay attention to the subtitles in a long time, i found every bit of business spiel interesting and enjoyable. I would have never been able to write a story such as this one involving so much about trade and economics, the falling and rising of prices, dealing, contracts, companies, scams, etc.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end you get your money's worth of story and content, to top it all off you have a very attractive and skillful wolf God in the mix.\\n\\n\r\n9 - Very much satisfied thank you. I anticipate the second season!\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Prepare to be entertained, in the smart way. Never has trading been so tense and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSo stop what you're doing, put that down, and watch this.\\n\\n\r\nI give it a deserving 9! \\n\\n",

            "content": "STORY (8/10)\r\nThe story of spice and wolf is overly simplistic, but don\u2019t get me wrong, simple things can be the best things. Ookami to Koushinryou is a story about Lawrence, a traveling merchant and Holo, a wolf deity. While economics do play a part in spice and wolf, you shouldn\u2019t let it stop you if you don\u2019t like the subject. The economics are really interesting in the series, you can see how Lawrence do his trades and earn his money, but obviously the story isn\u2019t only about this. On a personal point I think it\u2019s the characters that make this series original and good.\r\nSOUND (8/10)\r\nIlove spice and wolf ost\u2019s, the opening is great, it fits so well with the anime, even the ending is good (even if it\u2019s \u2018\u2019engrish\u2019\u2019). I really loved Holo and Lawrence voices, they fit perfectly. The background ost\u2019s really add a good atmosphere in the anime, they are unique, it\u2019s the kind of ost that I enjoy listening while doing other things.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (9/10)\\n\r\nThis is by far the best part of spice and wolf. The characters are so unique. Holo is an awesome character, her personality is well made and she\u2019s an original character, she\u2019s not your main tsundere girl you will see in every anime. Lawrence is a good character too, this guy doesn\u2019t know how to talk to a girl which can be funny sometimes, how he doesn\u2019t understand how Holo thinks, and he\u2019s a cool merchant, what else can I say? The relationship between our two main characters are something that I really enjoyed, there\u2019s always a \u2018\u2019tease and tease back\u2019\u2019 when they talk together. It\u2019s really enjoyable and they are the type of characters you will eventually care for as the story goes.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (8/10)\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re someone like me who really enjoys when characters are well made and are not left undeveloped you will definitely enjoy everything about spice and wolf. As a light novel reader I think the season one was really well adapted, they did not leave weird plot holes that they could have done by skipping light novels things, which is really enjoyable. I would definitely re-watch spice and wolf in a year or two. I can\u2019t, but suggest anyone who loves spice and wolf to read the novels, they are awesome. Spice and Wolf as surely climb to my top five favorite series of all time\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10, would recommend\\n\\n\r\nTL:DR: Story is great, characters are awesome, memorable series, if you like spice and wolf I suggest that you read the novel to continue this awesome adventure!\\n\\n\r\n*Sorry for my mistakes, English is not my native language.*",

            "content": "*Some minor spoilers. Proceed at your own risk.*\r\n*Have not read the manga or light novels, nor am I aware of what goes on in them. I will likely not be reading them.*\r\n*This review takes into account the developments of the second season.*\r\nIf you've seen any of the other media associated with this anime, you probably think you know what it's about. Cute wolf girls, lots of fan service, medieval action, etc. It is with no small amount of surprise that I can report that this show is not at all what it appears to be on the surface. I believe that I'd go so faras to call it truly unique--at least, I've never encountered another anime (or really, television show period) that's comparable. Yes, it draws you in with the furry manic pixie dream girl element, but two episodes in it reveals its true intentions: Spice & Wolf is not about mindless, hyperactive cuteness and adventure. At the risk of sounding off-putting, it's equal parts Renaissance-era Wall Street and Linklateresque talky romance. Let's approach these two halves one at a time.\\n\\n\r\nAnime fans are used to action. Even the rom-com and every-day life drama anime equivalents typically have action sequences. Consider the mindlessly cute and mostly harmless Fruits Basket--sure, the kung-fu is mostly used for comedic effect and nothing is really at stake, but that doesn't stop these action sequences from being choreographed carefully (well, within the context of the show) and from being absorbing at a character level. There are exceptions to this generalization, but even if there's no strict action there still tend to be sequences of increased hyperactivity that pass for action--characters bouncing around the frame and super-deforming to ramp up the emotion, drama, or absurdity of a sequence are very common, as are moments of un-explainable magical realism or characters showing off previously unseen skills to liven up the on-screen happenings a bit.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Spice & Wolf doesn't break completely from the above conventions (obviously--there's a wolf-girl, after all!), it does so more drastically than any other anime I've seen, with the possible exception of Paradise Kiss. The key difference between the two is that Paradise Kiss built tension by relying on coming-of-age storytelling elements and teenage angst. Spice & Wolf is concerned with economics and trade. And I'm not saying that it's concerned with economics and trade in the same way that Hikaru no Go is concerned with Go. There is very little effort to hold the viewers' hand or to make the tension of the central machinations 'more exciting.' Spice & Wolf's plot twists revolve around market crashes, unexpected fees, and the ebb & flow of supply and demand. Its characters talk at great length and (and so far as I can tell) display great knowledge about market influences, financial risk assessment, credit poisoning, etc. Occasionally (particularly in the first season), surprise violence pushes the plot forward, but more frequently it's the hazards of being a traveling merchant in a volatile market that supplies the series' tension, at least on the plot-arc level. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not for everyone. Some are going to find it incomprehensible. I actually had to rewind and pause frequently while watching the subtitled version to fully understand what was happening in some scenes (and some moments are still beyond me), and I was pleasantly surprised to realize that the characters were 'coming' to conclusions more quickly than I was--which almost never happens in anime. Anime is fully capable of being heady and difficult--though frequently when it is challenging your intelligence it's doing so from a post-modern/avant-garde/metaphorical position. Spice & Wolf instead challenges your logic and your intuition. When its characters sit down to discuss business, you realize that they are playing a very advanced game of chess, or perhaps poker, with one another. They are gambling, and the stakes are high, and if you're not as in-tune with their dealings as they are, you will get left behind. I thought it was actually sort of exhilarating. Frustrating, yes, but challenging and stimulating. Of course, I suspect that this aspect of the show won't hold up as well on repeat viewings--which is where the romance comes into play, and where the writers really, really deserve credit.\\n\\n\r\nThe story gets its start when Holo, a wolf goddess who influences wheat yields for a small southern town, sneaks onto a travelling merchant's cart on his way out of town. The townsfolk, through their own ingenuity, no longer require her supernatural intervention, and she is tired of being alone and unneeded. She wants to journey north, to her place of origin, and reunite with entities she has not seen in centuries, and has largely forgotten. The series hints (or maybe I'm reading into it way too deeply) that her hugely extended lifespan may be coming to its drawn-out conclusion--she seems to suffer physically from a weak constitution, and mentally from years of regret and a desire to do things over again. The merchant she imposes herself upon is Lawrence, and he is truly a breath of fresh air, insofar as male leads in anime are concerned. He's got a head of grey hair and has already been through his 'coming-of-age' story. Lawrence has learned how to be an adult and has been one for some time. He's set in his ways, wise, and sure of himself. He does have some weaknesses, particularly for pretty women and for gold, but he knows what he wants in life, and is already working toward it when he discovers the very naked Holo in the back of his cart.\\n\\n\r\nLet me quantify 'very naked' here. Holo is shown nude frequently throughout the series--as a wolf goddess, the only reason she really wears clothes at all are to hide her ears and tail from prying eyes when in her 'human' form. This sounds like a weak attempt to defend the nudity, but it helps that Holo's nudity is rarely sexualized, thanks to her Barbie doll anatomy--by which I mean not only in the lack of explicitly drawn detail (contrast this to the frequently disgusting nude fan service in a show like Elfen Lied), but in her unrealistic features (her conical breasts). She does know that she's attractive and uses her sex appeal to her advantage, but in another rare turn for anime, she manages to do so while being clothed head to foot. (Indeed, when in public, she looks almost like a nun, albeit a stylish one.)\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, Lawrence, in awe of her power, agrees to aid her in her journey north. Along the way they become business partners after Holo demonstrates uncanny business sense and intuition, and they quickly thereafter become fast friends. They consistently and amusingly banter with one another, and their teasing and flirting (sometimes gentle, sometimes not) is a pleasure to behold. They both relish wit and wordplay, yet both seem afraid of their emotions, and occasionally wound each other deeply. By the time the second season starts, we realize that Holo may love Lawrence in ways that he either does not reciprocate or is afraid of returning, and Holo is afraid of the emotional harm she'll do to herself if she allows herself to love a mortal, whose lifespan is but the blink of an eye, compared to hers. It's a well-worn idea in fiction (and in myth), but is here spiced up considerably by their complex relationship that balances business and flirtatious friendship with Holo's need to go home and Lawrence's dreams of owning his own storefront in a large city. They cannot travel together for forever, no matter how much they enjoy one another's company. The two come to the conclusion that it may take in excess of a year to find Holo's home-this is presumably not a problem for Holo, but a year is a long time for Lawrence. Lawrence can only put his life on hold for her for so long, and when Holo realizes this fact, she begins to consider leaving him early and letting him move on with his life.\\n\\n\r\nViewers conditioned to expect certain things from romantic relationships in anime might be frustrated. (Typical YouTube comment: 'I would sell my family just to see Holo and Lawrence kiss!') Both strive to keep the heat between them low, but both eventually become possessive of one another, and commonly-explored themes like jealousy and self-sacrifice are given time in the limelight, though in ways viewers may not be used to seeing. In a sense watching the relationship between the two grow can be maddening--the writers treat the romance on a slightly cool and reserved level (outside of Holo's seemingly playful attempts to seduce Lawrence), and so much depends on what the viewers think of the characters themselves. It'd be easy to just call Holo a manipulative tease and Lawrence a greedy idiot and just move onto another anime with more 'satisfactory' character development. In fact, it almost seems like the writers are trying to do this on purpose--as if they were weeding their audience. Viewers that become truly invested in Holo and Lawrence will be physically pained when the two genuinely fight--others will just shrug and say that they don't get it. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending will please even fewer people. The ultimate destination is not reached, with the writers opting for an emotional climax instead--albeit it a hugely understated one that relies on a close, almost literary reading of the characters and an important development in the penultimate episode to get anything out of. It will please those who admire restraint, but people who want definite conclusions will either be itching for a third season or will just be turned off completely. Truthfully, I would not mind seeing a third season myself, and since the anime is based on a still ongoing series of novels and/or manga, there is more than enough material to justify another season. Still, it's a finely honed ending to a finely honed series that has subverted expectations throughout. I realize that I haven't yet written about the art or the music (both fine, but neither amazing), but let's leave it at this: Spice & Wolf is a series that boasts incredibly well-developed characters, fantastic writing, and a unique sensibility with regards to conflict and resolution. It trades in action for talkiness, and ease of appreciation for real challenge. Its greatest flaws (the mercantile plot, the tricky romantic angle) are also its strongest attributes. It's not for everyone, but you won't know if it's not for you until you give it a try. Or if you possess greater respect for my reviews than I do, myself. Lol.",

            "content": "Spice and wolf at first I have to say this is a slow paced romance anime much of the show is predicated on witty and clever dialogue and they spend most of the time  talking about how merchants make their profit the other half is the Romance between a wolf deity and a merchant first lets start with the star of the show which is holo the wolf deity she is the one that makes thing worthwhile during its slow pace she just about has all this a knowledge and street smarts of a elder with animal instincts but her companion which is themain protagonist Lawrence is not bad either he is what I call the clever business man or trade man he is the one that meets holo but he really isn't that interesting for a main protagonist but oh well this show can't be perfect the romance and story of this show builts up slowly and the drama as well which are really good there's only two arcs one deals with shady business and the other deals with bankruptcy the way they navigate through these problems are clever but predictable but the story is only good if u are emotionally invested in the clever dialogue the main characters between each other throughout much of the series  there isn't much action some here and there visuals sound pretty good but not mind blowing this story is only about the love and business or $$$ so if u don't like stuff like this don't watch it all that matters is if u like clever dialogue and romance between a merchant and wolf god this is for u see ya later :)",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf is a perfect example where I loved a series despite not grasping the telling of the tale of this fantasy, this historical fiction, and a simple story of growth and bond. I loved most of the first season. It's fair to say that I'm not in the minority about not understanding the economical side of the story. I'd go as far as saying that I expect 80% of the viewers were too young or not sharp enough to get the gist at first viewing. Despite not much happening in the first season, you cannot know for sure that somethingwill not happen at some point. If this anime were a Japanese novel, it'd be stunning. I'd probably not be able to lay my hands on that imaginary book, and I'd not even be aware of it. Big thanks to the anime community for keeping on producing art that is risky, outlandish, solemn, daring, thoughtful, eager, wholesome, fantastic, and in the case of Spice and Wolf, humble and unpretentious.\\n\\n\r\n  The animation is gorgeous. Most animes, especially long running ones, tend to lower the absolute best bar of the background, so as to blend in the characters and the decor, landscape and the background.  There's also the budget and the schedule to think of. Spice and Wolf foolhardily gives us some gorgeous and magical drawings of  the scenery and boldly differs the animated characters from the world. This, is not a problem, as there is no gamble that paid off, since I'm sure the animators knew what they were doing. Considering that I've never seen such rendering in any other anime I can think of, I wonder why this is so. The standards of animation has followed the trajectory of any medium where drawing is involved - anime, manga, comics. These last few years have been a golden age for anime and I wish - en passant - that along with us, the hardworking animators would profit from it as much as us viewers do.\\n\\n\r\n  The strong points in favor of the high score eclipses the lapses in Spice and Wolf but we do feel the errors' pull. Humor is surprisingly near inexistent in most of the 13 episodes I've watched. The 'acting' of Lawrence in particular, is lacking in subtle and varied terms. This seems to be a direct result of the yoyoing playful but repetitive bond between Holo and Lawrence. Holo is the playful character and it's good that she doesn't joke really, but taunts and teases, but often with a punctuality coated with girlish charm. The routine that develops is that Holo keeps on yanking the chain of Lawrence and we expect Lawrence to retort but his reactions are the shrugs of a man prematurely old and fully knowing of his situation, and accepting it with stoic regularity.\\n\\n\r\n  I've forgotten most of the males' names and remember Nora Arendt's because the former are so many and interchangeable while women are at a premium in Spice and Wolf. The drawing style of the anime is not kiddy at all and Nora is the one that benefits most from it. I was quickly concerned about her well-being, and I don't know for sure who she is exactly. She seems shy, devout, humble, timid but trusting and fearless and loving towards her animals. She is important in providing a rival of sorts for Holo. Or at least, that's what they want you to believe. Talking about Spice and Wolf is rather difficult and I've done my best, and exceptionally, I count this review to be more writing than talking. Hope it has been useful to you! \\n",

            "content": "Spoiler Alert\r\nIt is about a merchant, Lawrence, who travels around selling various goods. He comes across a wolf-god, Holo, and they travel together so that Holo can return to her home with a companion. Holo is dependant on Lawrence at first, but she helps with Lawrence's trade now and then, and their mutual relationship pays off. However, Their journey goes not go according to plan all the time.\r\nThe main reason why I liked this show is because the tease from Holo is not fun, but it's very heartwarming. She is like the female senpai you always wanted to be with. The emotional connection between thecharacters are genuine, and the connection between the character and the viewer is also very genuine. The expression and the music help you get into the zone, if you understand.\\n\\n\r\nOne criticism it always receives is that it is very dialogue heavy. This is true, but it is partly the whole point of the anime. The expected level of intellectual knowledge one needs to enjoy this is rather high, so if you don't like to think as much, or don't like reading the text as much, and would prefer visual anime, this anime isn't for you.\\n\r\nMy personal criticism for this is that I disliked the ending song. Although there are others who completely disagrees with me, I felt that the lyric and the voice was not suited to the anime. It very much sounds like my mother trying to speak English (I am full Japanese). The starting song however, is gracious. It is the perfect song, especially because the rhythm and the meaning of the song matches with the story. I don't like the translated song.",

            "content": "So i decided to make a random review to help this site. Don't just judge my review by my score (7). I do not think this anime is weak in fact i think it has very strong points and i really like it.\r\nSo this show is about two travel buddies one wolf god and a merchant and definitely the best part about the show is the dialogue and interactions between these two.\r\nThe story is not particularly appealing but don't let this fact undermine this great anime, Spice&Wolf is more about the journey than the destination.\r\nLets go for the reason i gave a 7 instead ofthe usual 8/9/10 people give. First i use a comparing system for my scores, while the setting (medieval europe) is a favorite of mine i feel like it could have been explored a bit further.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part about this series is how it looks, not in the art style sense but in overall animation quality and stuff. It still works, its not jarring enough to break imersion but even compared to titles of the same year it wasn't great.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the relationship of the main characters was fantastic i felt like all the other characters where meh. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing i also disliked where the \"villains\" or the conclusion to each arc (this anime has 2) the disclosure on both felt lacking. The middle part of each arc was definitely the more interesting part because you get a lot of interaction and they actually explain medieval economics a mit\\n\\n\r\nThis show is also really mature and approaches its themes very very well, there is no obnoxious fanservice (even though theres a few naked scenes) but in the context of the show it works really well.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all if you are on the fence about watching this show i will ask you 2 questions: are you a fan of romance? and do you value character interactions highly? If you answered to any of these yes then you should check out this show\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR read the paragraph before this one\\n\\n\r\n+ strong main cast\\n\r\n+ romantic relantionship\\n\r\n+ interactions between main cast\\n\r\n+ mature approach to stuff\\n\\n\\n\r\n-world not explored enough(imo)\\n\r\n-side characters\\n\r\n-conclusion to each arc (and its respecting \"villains\")",

            "content": "After reading many reviews and seeing the awsome rates people gave to this anime, i had pretty high expectations, and although it was a good show it wasn't as good as i though it would be. \r\nStory:\r\nI found the story very original because it is focused on economy and how is a merchant life in medieval times. But i felt that this topic was featured in the series to only been understand by people how knows about economy.  The strategies used are so complexly explained that you have to re-watch many times these scenes to actually understand what are they going to do. \r\nIimagine that probably most viewers won't be masters of economic studies, so that might hold up you a little bit in the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nRealism:\\n\r\nThis anime introduces a medieval atmosphere that i have never seen in any other anime so far. Most anime that are located in the middle ages mix magic and spells that take out any realism of the series (such as Zero no tsukaima, for example). Spice and wolf have a totally different feeling: Everything look so real and accurated to the time. The clothes, buildings, social scale, economy, transport, the power of church, everything.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack fits perfectly with all the atmosphere, the right instruments are used and that really helps to the enjoyment of the series. The opening is gorgeus, i didn't skip it a single time, and after listening to it many time i realised that apart from the female voice, in the chorus, there was a male voice behind; and that made me love even more the song.\\n\r\nThe ending song isn't appealing for me but the pictures that are shown in the ending looks really cute.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIn my opinion if it wasn't for Horo, the whole cast would be boring and forgettable. The only one that stands out is her: She's sassy, smart and funny. The other characters, including the main one, are just generic.\\n\r\nSomething that pissed me off is how Chloe's character is managed trough the anime. You see all this secondary characters which you know that won't appear more than 2 chapters in the series and won't be very important; but Chloe looks like she's going to do something big in the series. After many episodes without seen Chloe, she appears in one envolved in a big problem with a company. I though: \"Oh, i knew she was gonna be important\" but, no! She\u00b4s just left to the side and what could became a perfect villain becomes another forgettable character. I would wanted to watch her confronting Lawrence face to face.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art in general is good but i found some scenes were the backgrounds are static and while Horo and Lawrence are walking, the rest of the people are in a certain position without moving and that feels weird. The characters could have had more realistic features to complete the hole atmosphere, but is was fine anyway.\\n\\n\r\nTo end up my opinion, i think that the end was too opened. I know there is another season but sometimes is better to round a little bit everything to give a nicer feeling.",

Some even called it \"Economics: The Animation\" due to its nature of talking economics on every possible occasion. The set of the story is in Medieval Europe (I think) or influenced by it. Instead of having the MC as a brave knight who's going to save the kingdom or a crown prince, here we have...... a peddler! Yep, a humble peddler is our MC. So, it's given fact that the anime will involve economics and yeah... a lot of talkingtoo. Even so, even when you somehow flunk your economics class in high school, you don't have to worry about having to read your old textbook since you'll still understand a bit of what's happening to them without a proper knowledge of economics (But, it's advised to have at least a basic knowledge of economics for the best experience)\\n\\n\r\nAh, if you're looking for romance, I have to say this up front. The romance is there but, it's lacking. They tease you here and there but they never actually enter such relationship. It's cute to see their interaction, though.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the character, it mostly progresses around the duo MC and their everyday life as a peddler. It progresses nicely in my opinion. You will end up caring for the two over the course of the story.\\n\\n\r\nI really love this anime. It's a breath of fresh air for me from my usual watching list. I have my doubt when watching this but I give it a try anyway. Needless to say, I have no regret",

Lawrence whose heart is kind enough to help Horo in finding his homeland and take her there. Along there adventure, they encounter many troubles about the deals they take. Honestly, it is somewhat complicated for me to understand some scenarios that I needed to repeat it again but once I did, it is really interesting. The story did a really great job in tackling every significant information on every decision Lawrence take as a merchant. Not only Lawrence but mostof the story. It revolves around how a barter system works, how to think when you're an entrepreneur, I guess. The economy of the town they go into and what are the advantage they can get in order to make a credit for it. Of course, there will also wrong decisions, a bad reading of the people who you make deal with, a sudden change in the economy, a downfall as a merchant. It is all in this series. This anime keeps me goings and click the next episode button. It is a great anime to watch, even though it is a classic one. The season 1 is great while the season 2 is much more greater.\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10/10\\n\r\nLawrence and Horo is a funny combination, I guess. Horo is too talkative, too comical, too teaser. While Lawrence, is kinda old and serious and the type who can't even break a plate. He is too kind. But eventhough it's like that, they have a funny way to express their likeness with one another. Along the story, Lawrence successfully show the character of a real merchant, the struggle and the effort he did in order to keep the thing he owned intact. And the emotion which is growing inside of him that affects the way of his thinking as a merchant. While on the other side, Horo, also change and opens up to Lawrence more. How she is scared on being alone, how she helps Lawrence on making a decision when she knows it is needed. How they don't leave each other even after every quarrel and misunderstanding they get into. It is a lovestory, yes. But it more focuses in the economy side. And eventhough it is like that, you can still feel the love or likeness from them in a sweet or small gesture they did with one another and that is what makes it cute. Eventhough Lawrence is not something like a protagonist like, a common one I mean. The one who is handsome and charismatic and the like. What I'm pointing is he is a simple one. A normal one. And even if he is like that, you can still take interest on him. This is where personality takes action.\\n\r\nSOUND: 10/10\\n\r\nI love the voice of Horo, really. It is too good in the ear. It is too regal. Like I am listening to a queen's voice and the like. While Lawrence voice is a mature one. Sometimes, a sarcastic tone is sliding and it still depends on the scenario they're in. The other voices will make you think that there is something hidden on it. That they are planning on something. Thus, it all made the series really great. The opening and the ending song is cute. It is solemn and easy and light to listen to.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed it. I learned new things in these series. And there is no single episode that bore me. Every action of the two protagonist, will either make me laugh or think. Though, it is somewhat an old anime compare to the new ones, it is one of the best for me. It can level on the other new series that's been release. It is a great watch and it's worth it.\\n\r\nENDING: 9/10\\n\r\nI want more. I want to see more of Horo and Lawrence story. The ending is satisfying, I guess. But since it is a great series, there is nothing I can feel that to need more of it. Something like how they really end up. Sinve Horo is a pagan God, she won't get old unlike Lawrence. I want to watch more struggle they will take. But yeah, the ending was also good. I mean, great.",

With out either of these i may have dropped this already.\r\nThe relationship between the two of them is kind of adorable. Only issue with this is that they tend to not even have much time getting to know each and talk about each other. \r\nHave you ever played a game Like Mass Effect or watched an anime like Little Witch Academy and wondered \" Wow, I love these stories so much but the only thing bugging me is i want to know more about the world Economics and whata merchants life is like ?\" No you may say ? Well too bad cause this is what we get instead of bonding time between the two MC's. \\n\\n\r\nNot a single 5 minute instance will go by were they aren't talking about trade or the value of the coin. It's pretty bad. It's also annoying cause this time we spend could be spent on the Two MC's \\n\\n\r\nI think this could have been better if it was just the two MC's going town to town while experiencing random events. \\n\\n\r\nThe only other problem with this is that we get these forced feeling types of evil schemes that tend to not make any sense and only seems to be in the show as a way of filling time. \\n\\n\r\nLawrence ( I think is the guy MC) He tends to not be very smart and gets himself into trouble. \\n\\n\r\nBut i do really like this show. Even if i did take breaks from it cause of the evil schemes happening. Holo and Nora and the two best characters with the third being Nora's dog. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is also very nice and the music is the finishing touch on this. \\n\\n\r\nOverall i greatly recommend it if you think you can look past hard to follow talk about the worlds economy.",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf is a sweet story based on the trading of goods in a medieval setting, showcasing light action, a lot of meaningful, rewarding character interactions.\r\nStory: 7\r\nIts story isn't the forte - in Spice and Wolf, the character dynamics between Lawrence and Holo make for the blunt of the show's strengths. The story is therefore rather on the light side, and mainly serves to showcase the two protagonists; however, it still stands on its own merits, keeping us on our toes more than one could think upon hearing the premise of the show.\r\nArt: 8\r\nAs for the art, the character designs range from good togreat, with a special mention for Holo's design. They managed to make most characters memorable in a universe where it's easy to come up with plain, hard-to-differentiate designs. The background art, while good, can get repetitive, however, as the different cities often have quite similar taverns and buildings and the color palette is limited.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe voice acting is great and fits the characters; for instance, you can quite easily tell the dynamics of a conversation between the two main characters without watching attentively, even with limited or no knowledge of Japanese. The sound design is otherwise adequate, and while the ED isn't my favorite, the OP is extremely calming and memorable. The soundtrack is otherwise great and complements the mood.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, the character dynamics make this show. Holo and Lawrence's relationship develops smoothly and avoids a lot of tropes well. Their relationship actually shapes up throughout the whole season in a very sensible way, at a good pace. Their quips and quirks remain interesting and varied the whole way through, and their interactions with other characters contrast and complement each other nicely. Moreover, seeing their affection for each other slowly blossom kept the show quite sweet.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nRight from the start of the opening, Spice and Wolf takes you right into its atmosphere. Said atmosphere lets you follow along with the mood of the show every step of the way. Relating to the characters and enjoying the ride is made easy, and even in its tense moments, the show lets you bathe in its setting and emotions in a very rewarding way. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

            "content": "Just a little thing before I start, I do my best to write my own opinion and not read anyone else's opinion before hand but sometimes I do so ha. Anyways let's get started. \r\n\u2665\r\nRecommended: If you are okay with a slow anime with a lot of dialogue but overall, yes. \r\nRead Manga: Yes,\r\nBest Character: Holo\r\n\u2665\r\nThe anime is extremely calming. Somehow this anime gave me a feeling I've never felt when watching this anime, it gave me a feeling. Somehow this made me feel happy and calm. In this anime you can almost picture if this was real. You could almost imagine that the wolfgod is true. You can almost see Holo and Kraft and cheese almost real. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime itself isn't super climaxed itself but it what makes the anime. The anime is an adventure story with the two main characters going around in the countryside while we can learn about merchants. This anime teaches you in a diffrent way about merchants and teaches about the struggles they go through and their tactics. With the main male character (Kraft and cheese) he uses a bunch of tactics and is successful merchant. Though I don't remember anything they taught us because I binegd it in two days so... My fault.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are diffrent. They aren't the normal age group you get in anime. We have two adults. Not teens. So it always feels nice when there is a change. \\n\\n\r\nOne con about this anime is how slow it is but I really didn't mind how slow it is. Another con is I wished they could go more indepth with the anti protagonist but it's okay and the last con is the dialogue, it isn't something I can really sit through.\\n\\n\r\nThe pro is something I rarely see in anime, A natural romance between the characters. When they do flirt with each other it's natural and it's something you can see them saying.  \\n\\n\r\nThe background art was something I needed to point out, the colours and the scenery were so nicely done and it looked beautiful. It fits with the whole anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a once in a lifetime story and I wish I could see more of these kinds of anime.",

            "content": "Spice and wolf review. \r\nSpoilers may be in this review \r\nSpice and Wolf is a show which isn't impressive on any front. It isn't bad, it isn't good, it just is. It exists and that is all there is to the show, story and characters. Existence and that is. Whilst I say it\u2019s so unimpressive that it deserves no more than 6/10. \r\nThe graphics aren't terribly impressive, the art style is typical the sound is okay and the voice acting was fine. But it\u2019s so so. It won\u2019t leave a bad taste but just a slightly sweet taste. \r\nI\u2019d probably be inclined to give itmore if it had finished the story. Some people like the whole just existing thing, and I can understand the satisfaction in that, but if there is no end you find no closure. \\n\\n\r\nStory \\n\r\nWhat can I say, the story is unique in terms of settings and occupation of the characters, but other than that it was bland. The most engaging thing about the show as all the talk about economics. \\n\r\nThe romance and drama was so predictable that I didn't find allot of enjoyment in it. The story is so boring, but the setting, characters, and economic talk and it\u2019s relation to politics made up for it for me a bit. Because of that I wasn't bored and did enjoy the show somewhat. \\n\\n\r\nTech \\n\r\nNothing much to say, it\u2019s so average it hurts. There wasn't anything really impressive about this except for the background art. This links to why the setting was so interesting. But there really isn't anything more to say. Music was fine, art was fine, and animation was fine everything was fine. Nothing to complain about only one thing to praise. It\u2019s kind of depressing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nLawrence was an interesting character to me. Holo started interesting and fun but then in the second season descended into a spoiled Princess, but regained some of her former self towards the end. \\n\r\nLawrence was too good willed for Holo\u2019s own good. Other than this there were other characters which were interesting on the way, don't expect me to remember their names. The woman who was a bird was a good character, she seemed charming. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion \\n\r\nIt was an anime which is just there. Not impressive but not a disappointment. Even though it\u2019s just that I think it\u2019s still worth a bit of a watch. I am kind of regretful that there wasn't an ending, but kind of happy that they didn't continue producing it. After this point I think the show would have ended up repeating itself. I think maybe an epilogue movie would be in order just to give it a good ending.",

            "content": "Overall I would give the show a 8.5 if there was the option too. \r\nHowever, this show; since in reality it does not go through the entirety of the story which can be found in the light novels. The story is not seen to its fullest, however what is seen from it can be rather dull or quite interesting depending on your view on economics and whether or not you find it interesting. The story follows the travelling Merchant in Medieval times who meets up with the god of the harvest Holo, and they begin to adventure together. Although quite  generic start that's notreally a big problem in my eyes. The story progresses quite quickly, however there is a LOT to follow in terms of intellectual thinking, it plays around with economics to an extent I haven't seen in an anime before however it gives you more insight into the way that the characters are thinking which can be good. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of this show was actually very good, and in the 2nd season the art only gets better in terms of background characters. The art is nice and fluid, however in some scenes it doesn't quite look right and sometimes the animations seem a little one dimensional. However, all in all the art helps capture the times that they are living in and really helps to set the mood with the lighting etc. so aside from a few hiccups and it not being as good of art as some other anime's such as Attack on Titan for instance it is really easy on the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nNow for sound, this is one of the two areas of the show that really impressed me and really hooked me onto the show which allowed me to complete it in just under two days! The character voices in the dub are top notch, and the same voice actors are in both seasons. In the second season one character (you will know who when you watch the show) may sound a little whiny however this is the only not top notch voice acting of the entire show, and the other side characters absolutely make up for the lackluster performance of this one character. Overall the sound is amazing, both the character voices and the sound tracks that are used to set the mood perfectly! \\n\\n\r\nCharacters; the two characters Holo and Lawerence, are phenomenal characters. The voices obviously help with this, however the characters are brilliant they have so much development over the course of the show and you really get attached to them, you feel for them and you REALLY want to see them get together the only draw back is the [SPOILERS] cliffhanger ending on the romantic front where you are unsure whether they did or did not end up together however, from the end scene I really got the feeling that yes they do end up together as they were going to move away and start anew [SPOILERS]. \\n\\n\r\nIs the anime enjoyable? This is really up to the individual decision, for me yes it was. I was really attached to the characters, I love Medieval settings, the romance was really good and I always wanted to see them kiss or something >_< and yeah it was really enjoyable for me, I also liked the economic aspect as it really made me think as they were explaining it so I could understand what was happening and realize in advance what must be done to make a profit it was quite the learning experience really.\\n\\n\r\nOverall? I'd honestly rate this anime a 8.5 as I stated earlier, just due to the lackluster (in my opinion) plot that is presented in the anime as it is not completely finished. Other than that, the anime is great, the romance is really good they are a great pair of characters that really mesh in terms of personality, the merchanting is really interesting and the trouble they get into and the thrills provided by the show are really enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nReally good anime, only thing I'd say is that I'd recommend it only for quite seasoned anime watchers.",

            "content": "\u201dIn short, he longed for company more and more frequently. Such longing was an occupational hazard for merchants who spent the better part of a year alone in a wagon, but Lawrence had only recently begun to feel it. Until now, he'd always boasted that it would never happen to him. Still, having spent so many days alone with a horse, he started to feel that it would be nice if the horse could speak.\u201d (Spice & Wolf Vol. I by Hasekura Isuna)\r\nFirst things first, I highly recommend reading the light novels if you enjoy(ed) Spice & Wolf. The piece I quoted above really mademe feel for Lawrence in his solitude, and yet it's only 30 pages into the first volume. But without further of due, here's my review.\\n\\n\r\nWe're joined by Lawrence, a twenty-five-year-old traveling merchant. His sole dream is opening his own shop, and to achieve this he embarks on journeys from city to city in order to sell various merchandise. He travels only with his goods and his trusty stead, who steadily takes Lawrence's cart to his destination. While in a certain city, however, Lawrence spots the people doing some kind of ritual. More specifically, the villagers are running around in the wheat fields. It is their tradition in order to get a good harvest of wheat each year. \\n\\n\r\nWhen Lawrence has done his business in this village, he receives a gift. The said gift is some of the wheat, which Lawrence can trade in other cities. What he is unaware of is that a certain god resides within the wheat he carries; and that god is Holo. Holo is a wolf-god who lived in the village in order to keep her promise that she made, the promise in question was to give the villagers a good harvest. She abandoned the village since she noticed that they had good harvests without her and whenever there was a bad harvest she was blamed for it. Holo then joins Lawrence in his traveling in order to find the village in the north that she originates from; her home.\\n\\n\r\nThe world where this takes place is definitely inspired by the middle ages. The church, which seems to be of roman catholic origin, still has a lot of power but is on the verge of losing some of the power that remains. This affects both Lawrence and Holo on their journey through various ways.\\n\\n\r\nBeing in the middle ages, the scenery, consisting of a lot of woods and a lot of castles, is really mesmerizing to me. The character models, as well, are really well-made. There isn't a lot more to say, the illustrations speak for themselves.\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf has, without a doubt, some of my favorite music. Period. An opening performed by Kiyoura Natsumi (Tabi no tochuu) is constantly in my head and I never get sick of it. The sound, not only openings and endings, in Spice and Wolf will completely submerge you in the mood.\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf is a lot about how two traveling companions deepen their bonds, for better or worse, by tackling different hardships. It's also about how much you can learn by being next to one another, spending time together, relying on eachother. They really have managed to display a proper bond forming between two characters for me, and it is indeed a wonderful sight to behold.",

            "content": "If you want a basic idea on what the style of the story is, think the detail of Death Note's constant subconscious thinking of what the character is thinking and planning, pulling out some genius scheme on the spot- set in medieval times lined around merchanting, and the \"god\" being a cute girl who happens to be a wolf deity that is just as cunning as the protagonist.\r\nIf you like a simple storyline, that often than not has an underlying plot glistening in the dark, then this is for you. There's not much of twists, and it's pretty straightforward in most cases. The constantly changingrelationship between the deity, Horo, and the main character, Lawrence, is many a times humorous, where they constantly argue with each other in one scene, and having a good time in the next. They're able to show an extraordinary capability as a dynamic duo, and the possible romance that blossoms over times is tear-inducing as it builds throughout the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was done carefully and beautifully, you won't be disappointed when you see how well the artist drew both the people and nature. Each character, especially the main characters, have a more unique quality to them, and promises that you'll never forget a face.\\n\\n\r\nIt also has one of the most... is different the word? opening and ending songs, shocking you at first with how it is played, only to lead to full enjoyment of it afterwards. The ending song especially has a exquisite jingle to it, making you want to hum it afterwards. The opening song, however, is... beautiful. It's a remix of the actual song, but it was done in such a way that I immediately fell in love with it after listening to it a few times. Despite my constant \"fast-forwarding\" to get to the storyline, I would always listen to the opening scene just for that song. Enough said?\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is one of those animes that come under appreciated, and will not disappoint you in watching it. The second season is even better, so be prepared to enjoy much, much more once you finish the greatness, that is Spice and Wolf.",

            "content": "Almost every single S & W review here (and 80% of all the reviews in MAL for that matter) is a lesson on how to make anime enthusiasts rage.\r\nSeriously. A 10 isn't something you throw at every single category you think an anime did well at. And mediocre is not a 9 either.\r\nSTORY\r\nRefreshing, at least. How often do we come across a nice slow story about economics and a cunning wolf-girl?\r\nIf it was me I'd have put it at least as part-Slice-of-Life, but apparently it wasn't planned as such, so I'd have to give it a mark-down for the rather slow pace .(slice of life,in my adventure animu?) Also, the less than exciting (I'd say non-existent) ending left a lot to be desired, and almost screamed SEASON 2, FUND IT OTAKUS.\\n\r\nOh well. They barely covered half the novel material as far as I know anyway.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nThe quality isn't bad, especially considering that IMAGIN did this, and they haven't exactly been this good in the past. The background is given attention, the animation is decent, and the characters' expressions are usually well-drawn. Sadly, QUALITY still appears often enough to be noticeable, and in a few cases were very obvious (long-faced Lawrence in one scene was horrible). \\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nWhat at first seemed to be decent BGM turned out to be really well done and refreshing when I paid attention to it. Very well-matched to the scenes, and the variety was such that it never sounded repetitive, a feat especially impressive considering the unique challenge this anime posed to the music producer.\\n\r\nOP was 80% horrible (except for the starting part), but the extremely unique, catchy and upbeat ED (lol engrish) more than made up for that. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nYou'll have heard this before many times, but Horo is seriously one of the most intriguing and unique female characters around, especially considering that just about every other character that fits the same brief description (wolf-girl lieks running around nekkid) is, well, flat. A fascinating background, a childish personality and a sweet tooth, yet cunning, tricky and malicious as a real wolf when the situation called for it. You could almost say she carries the whole show.\\n\r\nWhich brings me to the big issue with this show. Horo unfairly makes every other character in this show look lame and one-dimensional by comparison (almost). The sweet-tongue money-changer, the shepherd with a dark side, even the well-developed male lead Lawrence; all of them seem almost like props around the main dish that is wolf-girl. Of course, if you take this show seriously and read into things, this probably won't affect you at all (you'd take issue with the sleep-inducing pace instead), but for casual watchers it obscures a large part of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nWell I approached it as a &quot;tranquil economics animu&quot;, and I'd have to say I had a great experience. It comes close to rivalling slice-of-life classics like Aria - I'm pretty sure it would if it were longer - and the journey never got very boring, a plus considering the pace. The ending was a real bummer though. At least make the effort to close it out nicely instead of leaving us hanging and going &quot;Wait, that's the end?&quot;\\n\r\nYou learn about basic economics though. Info tidbits appropriate to the theme are always nice.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nSlow and tranquil, yet refreshing, and with an amazing female lead. Just don't expect a real ending.",

Characters, locations, and objects were all given very special care and we're brought to life in the fullest extent.\r\nCharacters: 10/10\r\nA breath of fresh air from the ever common teenager protagonist, especially for a romance anime, Spice and Wolf hosts a cast of unique adults all striving their way through the harsh realities oflife as businessmen. The two protagonists deserve special mention as one of the best couples in anime, with cheesy and clich\u00e9d back-and-forths easily overwritten by intelligent banter and realistic interactions always so engaging and tangible.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nPlot twists that will leave you at edge of your seat, this anime is definitely not lacking in. Every major conflict that arises brings with it a different atmosphere, and makes one always eager to know how everyone involved comes out in the resolution, for better or for worse. The clever weaving of points forms a web that will certainly ensnare any viewer in self speculation and excitement.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe arias set the mood to a perfect tune and welcomed all to this majestic world of merchants.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI couldn't put this down.

            "content": "After walking around Hong Kong and thinking about, I've decided I don't want to continue watching the show. I have two main criticisms. First, I've watched a lot of anime and this is the first one where I felt like I wanted to read a plot to understand what was going on. Many of the plot points revolve around complex middle ages trade deals which while interesting are really hard to follow. My second criticism is in the jarring tone shifts. For example, one episode the characters are being escorted by a Sheppard and everything is light and fun. The next episode the character isa about to go bankrupt and in the course of single episode he starts getting desperate and turning on his partner. Admittedly it's an understandable response but it bothered me especially sense I enjoyed the lighthearted stuff so much. Outside of this the characters, especially Holo, are quite interesting. The setting being Europe in the middle ages is also quite interesting with the complexities of village life during that time which such actors and the merchants, the kings, and the churches all mentioned in a very realistic fashion. The music also stands out, not only the opening and closing themes which are quite good but the distinct intermental mostly flute music that playing during the anime. In summary, there are many things to like about this anime but I find it somewhat confusing and that it doesn't hold my interest. 7/10.",

            "content": "[Spice and Wolf Season 1 and 2 Review - Overall 8.5 / 10]\r\nSpice and Wolf (S&W) is what I'd call a great romance anime. It's a mature romance anime, and while not specifically targeted at an adult audience; I would call it a \u201cseinen\u201d romance \u2013 there are no cheap fanservice scenes, the characters\u2019 behaviors are not exaggerated and the story itself is well-paced. The story deals with economic concepts but you don\u2019t need a deep background in economy to follow along.\r\nIf I had to complain about one thing about the series, it is the lack of a definite conclusion. While there are 17 lightnovels (completed in Japanese, 12 translated to English by YenPress at the time of writing this), the anime only covers novels 1,2 (Season 1) and 3,5 (Season 2). That\u2019s not even half of the story. While the ending of Season 2 is satisfactory and still a must-watch, you\u2019re getting into a show that is incomplete. Each season covers 2 arcs, around 6 episodes each. There is no Season 3\u2026 yet! But we can hope!\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t let this discourage you however, Spice and Wolf is the show to watch if you\u2019re looking for adventure, slice-of-life travels and a great romance.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Background]\\n\\n\r\nKraft Lawrence is a travelling merchant that, while passing through a village, discovers a naked girl in his wagon. This girl has wolf ears and a bushy wolf tail and claims to be Holo the Wise Wolf, a wolf goddess. This is how their journey together begins, as Holo wishes to return to her homeland.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Art \u2013 8/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe art of S&W is well made. While the background scenes are not as pretty as some Miyazaki or Shinkai-level backgrounds, they are good enough and serve their purpose. I particularly liked how the old cities and towns are shown. I have a thing for depiction of medieval-set shows.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters\u2019 designs are good and many anime fans would agree that Holo\u2019s look is now iconic. No complaints there, but especially, no extravagant hair colours and things like that \u2013 which would look out of place in the atmosphere of the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Sound \u2013 8/10]\\n\\n\r\nI loved both the openings of Season 1 and 2. This music got stuck in my head for so long!\\n\\n\r\nThe music used during the \u201cdrama\u201d scenes are well-chosen and at some points, do well to enhance the atmosphere of the show and bring out the necessary tension. Nothing especially great (except the OPs, these are amazing), but the music serves its purpose.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters\u2019 voices were appropriate and don\u2019t sound childish \u2013 considering that the show depicts adults, this would have ruined it for me. Fortunately it\u2019s nothing like this. The emotions and outbursts were appropriately handled, without excessive shouting and loudness. I particularly like Holo\u2019s use of \u201cold Japanese\u201d if I could call it like this, such as the word \u201cnushi\u201d, short form of \u201conushi\u201d for \u201cyou\u201d, which could also be translated as \u201cmaster\u201d. Fitting, isn\u2019t it?\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Story \u2013 8.5/10]\\n\\n\r\nMany viewers will come to S&W because of the romance aspect of the show \u2013 you will not be disappointed, the romance between the two main characters is great! It\u2019s subtle at first then it gradually builds up. While I have not yet read the Light Novels, I hope the relationship is like this in the novels too. \\n\\n\r\nToo often, romance shows show the relationship with too much drama, for example, Toradora. Another common complaint with romance shows is that the relationship only develops at the end and is only shown over the final one or two episodes. Not in S&W. The relationship is all over the seasons and the best thing is, it seems natural. The characters behave in a very mature way and are not shy to show their appreciation of each other.\\n\\n\r\nOther elements of the story involve travel, adventure and economics. Not your usual blend of genres! The journey is fun too when we get to see the two main characters interacting on the road. The show is not romance, romance and romance! In fact, the romance is subtle but very heart-warming. You will also get tense moments, drama and even some action scenes!\\n\\n\r\nStill, my major complaint with the story is that sometimes, it gets complex to follow. I indeed said you don\u2019t need an economy background to understand the story, which holds for most of the show. But! A number of the plots revolve around economic aspects that for me, someone without economic background, were hard to understand. At some points, I was not exactly sure what was going on with the story or why the characters were so tensed, angry or sad. \\n\\n\\n\r\n[Characters \u2013 9.5/10]\\n\\n\r\nWhile I loved the characters, I cannot give them more than 8/10 based on what the anime shows. Yes, I said they behave in a way that fits the show and their relationship is great. I do wish that the characters stopped being so shy towards each other though. This may annoy a few watchers but it\u2019s not a serious problem.\\n\\n\r\nI believe Holo is one of the best female anime characters ever \u2013 she is intelligent, independent and yes, pretty. The depiction of her character is brilliantly done. She may be a Wise Wolf, but she does have her quirks and sometimes, childishness. Lawrence starts as a business-minded man who slowly discovers there are things beyond money.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I feel that their background is not covered appropriately. For example, the shows never mention Lawrence\u2019s background before meeting Holo, beyond \u201che was a travelling merchant before\u201d. There is no word of his family or his hometown for example.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, this does not apply to Holo and you will get extensive development on her background and her character in general.\\n\\n\r\nOne positive aspect I noticed is the development of the characters while travelling with each other. The way they behave when together changes over the course of the show, and the show itself does highlight this at several points. A nice change from anime where the characters remain fairly static and their behavior does not change much.\\n\\n\r\nAnother plus point is the lack of distracting side characters or \u201charem-type\u201d characters. While yes, there are a few times where they appear (to make Holo jealous!), their presence do not last long enough to ruin the show. Even these passing characters get background development.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I don\u2019t understand the reason behind this, some people do not like the witty exchanges and economic discussions between the characters. Check out a few episodes first. If you find you don\u2019t like the chitchat, then this show is not for you as this continues throughout.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment \u2013 8.5/10]\\n\\n\r\nI appreciated the show very much, definitely for how the relationship between the characters was shown. You don\u2019t get to see this kind of relationship often in anime. In fact, I\u2019d say S&W is the only anime that shows a \u201cmature\u201d romance relationship between two adults this well.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has a definite re-watch value, just to see the story again and re-live the travels and chats between your two main characters.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s slice-of-life like so you only get pure enjoyment out of re-watching the show, without having to follow a story seriously.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion \u2013 Overall 8.5/10]\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a good romance show, you cannot go wrong with S&W. The characters are great, the music is nice and above all, the way the characters behave, interact and talk to each other is what makes this show so good.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading!\\n\\n",

            "content": "My first review just had to be for Spice and Wolf. \r\nStory: 9   The story line was really well, Friar Lawrence agrees to accompany Holo on their way to Yoitsu, which is Holo's home, while taking action in the trade business. The relationship between the two throughout the anime only made it better. There is some action but a lot of dialogue which I'm fine with since I enjoyed it.\r\nArt: 9    The art was very well done for a 2008 anime. The artwork that was presented to us for the time setting of spice and wolf, made it feel evenmore real. They did well in showing the naked scenes for Holo, they didn't get in detail and that only made the anime much better (in my opinion)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10  The opening songs prepared you to enter the world of spice and wolf so well. I made a separate playlist just for spice and wolf since the music that's used is so different than what you hear in other animes (at least the ones I've watched) And the ending  was kind of comedic on holos personality. The songs they picked for this anime was magnificent.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10   It was very entertaining for me to watch Friar Lawrence \"protect\" Holo throughout the story. Holo loves to tease Lawrence and they're both pretty funny in these situations. The amount of supporting cast only made this show much better, as it only deepened the trust between these two. Although Holo was different from the average girl, it was enjoyable to watch her put up with Lawrence and vise versa.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10   Although this anime was excellent, I believe it would have a different impact on you if it was watched more than once. This was one of those animes where if I had any amount of free time, it was going to this when I was watching it. I enjoyed the music quite much, as the opening stirs me up every time I listen to it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10   Although it has been months since I've watched the series, I can't stop thinking about its. I believe every body should try this out, since it's different from most animes, and is quite enjoyable. This anime is so far my favorite one, and it could only be better if they continued the series.",

The lead male character's voice actor was the same for Lelouch Vi Brittannia from Code Geass same as well for the lead female character which is Kallen's voice actress from Code Geass also.\r\nIt's about a merchant who travels from town to town with a pretty female human wolf and a wagon pulledby two horses =)\\n\\n\r\nYou have to be prepared for a lot of dialogues and bunch of conversations. You might not understand some part due to that most of the conversations are about medieval ages' economy and merchant stuff\\n\\n\r\n A good mix of light comedy and light romance, so if your fed up from other anime or looking for a change then this series is right for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and plot is good that I would rate it 9/10\\n\r\nThe Art I would say it should be 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment should be 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSo overall I will give this anime a 10/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Loneliness is a disease like few others...  The longer it remains untreated, the harder it is to cure.  We\u2019ve all felt it\u2019s sting in one way or another...  Maybe a long term partner has abandoned us, or been taken away.  Maybe we\u2019ve faced a crisis that nobody around us could relate to.  Maybe we\u2019ve felt like outcasts in a setting full of people who could get along just fine without us there.  But what only a precious few of us have experienced is the kind of lifestyle where we\u2019re alone for weeks or even months at a time, andmeetings and reunions with even the closest of friends can be years apart.  Such a life would be a godsend for the jaded and cynical among us, but for the naive, committing to such a life can spell the long, drawn out death of the soul.  Such is the case with Lawrence Kraft, a man who took on the life of a traveling merchant while on the very cusp of adulthood, and now in his late twenties, has grown accustomed to brief reunions and long good-byes.  While skilled at his trade and deft in the ways of business, he dreams of one day opening up a shop and settling down for the long haul.\\n\\n\r\nWhile on a visit to Pasloe, a rural village famed more for their false pagan reputation than for their high quality wheat, Lawrence\u2019s world is rocked when he picks up the most unlikely of hitchhikers...  A naked girl with strange animalistic appendages, who claims...  And then unexpectedly proves...  To be a human incantation of the harvest god who\u2019s spent an unspecified but undoubtedly staggering amount of decades and perhaps even centuries guaranteeing the quality of Pasloe\u2019s agricultural bounty.  They strike a bargain to travel as partners, but both wind up getting more than they bargained for as Holo proves to be more than just a hapless bystander, and Lawrence proves to be more than just another fleeting acquaintance.  They slowly learn to trust, respect and eventually even depend on each other with each passing day, but with fortune and profit, they also find themselves faced with deceit, betrayal, and conspiracy behind every corner.  Will these two lonely souls from such vastly different walks of life be able to come together to overcome the challenge ahead, or is there nothing in their future but tragedy?\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, I was tempted to believe that Spice and Wolf was one of the better Studio Deen efforts...  It obviously didn\u2019t have much of a budget, as even a cursory glance at any given animation snippet could prove, but it still wound up looking damn impressive and uncannily pleasing to the eye.  While there are some noteworthy Studio Deen titles that carry these qualities, some of which I\u2019ve reviewed in the past(See my Sankarea and Irresponsible Captain Tyler reviews), the truth behind S&W\u2019s production is nothing short of miraculous.  The first season, which is what I\u2019m reviewing today, was produced by a company called Imagin, and if you haven\u2019t heard of it, of course not.  Aside from Spice and Wolf, the highest profile work that they\u2019ve done was in-between animation work for Eureka Seven, which is important work but barely counts as a credential.  Aside from these titles, I\u2019ve seen two of their eight major works, both of which I\u2019ve toyed with the idea of reviewing;  Love Love, whose very existence is hard to defend, and Strawberry Panic, a title that\u2019s popular with yuri fans despite looking like hot garbage.  \\n\\n\r\nSo it was a pretty significant surprise for me to find out that an anime with such mesmerizing visual execution could have come from such a dismal place.  With such a small budget, movement is limited, as still images are occasionally interrupted by flapping mouths and short bursts of motion, and while the backgrounds are heavily detailed and rich with appropriately chosen colors, they\u2019re not exactly attention grabbing.  The actual animation is cheap and the artwork feels too much like a still painting to feel immersive, and while you\u2019re probably expecting me to follow that up with an immediate \u2018but,\u2019 the visual design is really nothing special either.  That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s poorly done or inconsistent, and I do have to praise it for it\u2019s realism, but aside from a certain set of ears and a lovely tail, the characters follow a kind of generic aesthetic that should feel, well, boring.  Lawrence\u2019s prematurely grey locks aside, hair colors are fairly realistic, at least in accordance with it\u2019s western setting.  Holo was even given a longer face, sacrificing the deceptive element of cuteness that her manga counterpart had going for her.  So I have to pose the question, why does this anime look so beautiful, if none of the individual elements are particularly noteworthy?  \\n\\n\r\nThe answer is, of course, in the execution.  The characters may look a tad generic, and the backgrounds may feel lifeless, but the immersion comes from the natural way they blend in with each other.  The animation may lend itself to extended periods without any expensive movements, but this is a very dialogue-heavy series, which I,ll touch on later, and with the entire visual package being pulled together by gorgeous lighting effects and a calming, nostalgic tone that matches all of the autumnal colors perfectly, you won\u2019t complain about having to see the same screen for several seconds at a time.  It also helps that this show doesn\u2019t need any excessive amount of frames to deliver emotive facial expressions that can at times enrichen the dialogue.  People in the background do not just stand around like mannequins, although that\u2019s partially due to the way the framing keeps the focus away from them most of the time, so they didn\u2019t have to pour a waterfall of money into them the way an early Kyoto Animation effort might.\\n\\n\r\nThe music from Spice and Wolf is an orchestral blend of Medieval and Celtic tunes, with a heavy reliance on string and wind instruments and soft, haunting female vocals.  Some of the more festive tunes are incredibly catchy, such as Tsukiyo no Tategami and Hamu, but some of it\u2019s best tunes aren\u2019t as straightforward.  Kenshi to Yopparai, which plays often when Holo is upset or angry, and is yet strangely upbeat, leading to an end result that\u2019s oddly adorable, poking fun at her for losing her composure.  Satoki Hito Tachi sounds like a close cousin of the joyous Tsukiyo to Yopparai, despite being played in a much sharper key during any scene of danger or tension.  A personal favorite of mine is Kagen no Tsuki, quite possibly the most Celtic sounding song in the series, which acts as the theme song for the long life of sighs and sorrow that Holo has led up to this point in her life.  Actually, now that I think of it, this soundtrack is very much like that of a fantasy role playing game, which makes sense because the composer, Yuuji Yoshino, is primarily a video game composer.  Spice and Wolf is one of his few efforts, and his ability to diversify a single style of music across fictitious regions is the perfect proof of his qualifications.\\n\\n\r\nCeltic and medieval music in the anime medium are nothing new, but the opening and ending themes are somewhat unique beasts to say the least.  The opening theme, Tabi no Tochuu, is a lovely song that\u2019s easy to get lost in regardless of whether you\u2019re listening to the shortened TV version or the obligatory extended cut.  I don\u2019t want to underplay just how beautiful it is, but what really sets this op apart is the visual side of it.  I can only really compare it to the first op of Higurashi no Naku Koroni as it uses selective imagery as it retells the important aspects of the story by showing sides of the characters that you\u2019ve always assumed were there, but haven\u2019t seen.  By doing this, it offers the viewer clues as to the beats of the story that most of us won\u2019t get until the second watch.  Holo crying by herself, wolves running through the forest and a young blonde girl walking away from something while turning around to glance back at it hesitantly are images that hit you so hard once you understand the context behind them, as does the fact that through most of the OP, we just see Lawrence and Holo riding alone.  The ending theme is Ringo Biyori, and what makes it unique is that it\u2019s a silly, light-hearted childish tune that\u2019s not trying to pander to us or market itself to children.  For that, it\u2019s a welcome piece of levity.\\n\\n\r\nOver the years, I\u2019ve lobbed complaints and criticisms at two English Dub writers working at Funimation...  you could almost call them my nemesis at this point.  They\u2019re the dynamic duo of Jamie Marchi and J Michael Tatum, and I\u2019ve taken them to task multiple times for fucking up their dubs through repetitive writing, a focus on their own styles over the material, and a number of other tendencies that I\u2019ve had a rough time forgiving them for.  However, if you were to put a gun to my head and ask me to pick which one is the better of the two, the answer would undeniably be Jamie Marchi.  I\u2019m not just saying that because I hate Tatum\u2019s slew of memes and lazy internet references...  It\u2019s because while they both have conventions that piss me off, Jamie Marchi at least has the ability to put that bullshit away and take a project seriously when called upon.  If you\u2019re curious about how Tatum does when the pressure is on to accurately represent the speech patterns of a time period, whether fictional or not, look no further than Romeo X Juliet, where the Elizabethan speech is arbitrary and inconsistent, with some people saying things like \u201cwherefore\u201d while others just say \u201cwhy.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nMarchi, on the other hand, takes to such a project with a much more delicate touch, leaving all of her slang behind to employ much more down-to-earth dialogue, but at the same time, she doesn\u2019t let it get stilted, either.  She\u2019s able to employ a more timeless feel, creating speech patterns and terminology that are impossible to pin down to any sort of specific real world setting.  The exception to all of this is Holo, who carries a hint of a more noble, proper accent, but instead of speaking in vaguely Elizabethan terms, like she does in the manga(all your \u2018tis and thou\u2019 and whatnot), she instead uses a thoughtful turn of phrase that speaks of some long lost era that existed specifically in this world, rather than anything that can be tied to our history.  Her way of speaking and insightful prose fascinates many people throughout the course of the series, and yet it never comes across as pretentious or indecipherable, nor does she ever feel the need to use it on her traveling partner, with whom she shares a much more familiar tone.  She does tend to love her double talk and innuendoes, though, and Miss Marchi took to the challenge like a champ.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve already spoken about the dub at length in a list of my top ten favorite dubs, so I\u2019ll be brief.  The lead actors are Brina Palencia, who shines like a classic Hollywood icon in her role as the wise and wily Holo, bringing just enough of her honeyed tongue to a performance that I honestly consider to be one of the all time greatest, and the very same J Michael Tatum that I mentioned earlier.  As I\u2019ve said in the past, he\u2019s a far, far better actor than he is a writer, and his soothing, kind voice goes a long way in making the excessive dialogue infinitely more palatable.  The true star of the cast is not either one of them as individuals, but their chemistry.  Whether bickering or bantering, they speak so naturally that you tend to forget that either of them have ever played anyone else.  Several other famed Funimation actors pop up throughout the story, such as Leah Clark, John Burgmeier, Chris Sabat, Chuck Huber and Jamie Marchi herself, a list that\u2019s already sure to make any respectable voice chaser salivate with anticipation, and that\u2019s before you find out that every single one of them is right up there at the top of their game for a dub that I\u2019ve already championed as one of the best.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not the first person to make this observation, but the reception that Spice and Wolf received is baffling to say the least.  That\u2019s not to say it did poorly, or hit an unexpected market...  On the contrary, the success of this series has been overwhelming, striking a chord with both audiences and critics alike, both at home and abroad.  It\u2019s praised as a series full of beauty, depth and maturity, and yet it also found it\u2019s way into the hearts of people who normally only watch anime for the more shallow aspects of the medium.  It pleases both indie and mainstream audiences, those who are new to anime as well as those who\u2019ve seen it all before.  It\u2019s been a major merchandise pusher for almost nine years now, and while you could blame it all on sex appeal with the vast majority of the merchandise being centered around Holo herself, with posters, plushies and lavish figures still selling like hotcakes, but that wouldn\u2019t explain how it\u2019s come to be one of the few light novels to be translated and exported overseas successfully.  This is a series that\u2019s defied almost every possible limit while lurking just below the mainstream, and it\u2019s kind of hard to see why.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of overall quality, Spice and Wolf is comparable to the criminally underrated Kino\u2019s Journey, another mature show about traveling and exploring human nature.  In terms of popularity, however, it\u2019s much closer to the bombastic Baccano, despite the fact that the two shows have almost nothing in common.  I don\u2019t mean to sound cynical, but I don\u2019t see S&W as being fit for mainstream success.  It would make more sense as an underground show, passed around between pretentious elitists while they(Let\u2019s be honest, we) chortle and laugh at the dumb masses as they cry over shallow tragedy porn and give 10/10 scores to popcorn munching material while praising any Naruto fight scene that actually had enough of a budget to look mediocre.  So why would so many people latch onto a series where a good portion of the dialogue is about the economy of a fictitious land that we\u2019ll never be able to visit?  One that, I\u2019ll once again be honest, is explained to us about as well as remnant in RWBY was?  What is it about the adventures of an average man and a pretty wolf girl that everyone can\u2019t get enough of, and has people clamoring for a third season despite the lackluster quality of the second?\\n\\n\r\nWell, much like the show\u2019s visual quality, the answer is once again execution.  There\u2019s a reason people sit still and watch attentively through dialogue about economics, and there\u2019s a reason they don\u2019t need jokes and fanservice every five minutes to keep the story interesting. The focus is where it needs to be at all times...  On Lawrence and Holo.  This is a story about them, and as such, everything that happens in the story, without exception, has something to do with them.  Not only that, but it caters in the classiest possible way to one of the basest instincts of the anime fandom.  Everything that happens in this series, whether it involves them directly or indirectly, revolves around the developing relationship of the two main characters.  That\u2019s right, when you break the series down to it\u2019s lowest common denominator, it\u2019s less about economics and more about shipping.  People want to see Lawrence and Holo transcend they\u2019re status as traveling and business partners and cross the line into something more romantic and dynamic.  The show knows this, and caters to it openly, while never compromising the writing with cheesecake, forced romantic conflicts, or mushy dialogue...  At least this season.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t care who you are.  When it comes to romance in anime, you can only take so much contrived crap about a guy walking in on his love interest changing and fan-pandering, plot-unrelated love confessions in shows like Love Hina, Haganai and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood(sorry, it\u2019s true) before you expect to see something more subtle and realistic that you can actually relate to.  The fact that they become an item isn\u2019t technically a spoiler, either, because it has nothing to do with the trials and tribulations they face throughout the series.  There\u2019s no certain moment in the series where you can definitively confirm that they\u2019ve become a couple, but as much chemistry as these two characters have, and as well written as they are, they don\u2019t need anything obvious like grand, sweeping romantic gestures to convey it to you.  At some point, they just are, and you have no idea when or how it happened, and yet you can point to at least a dozen instances that made it obvious that they would.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a little exposition about the currency of the land, but none of it is important to remember, because all the audience needs to know to follow the plot is the basic idea of gold being more valuable than silver, and the rest can be taken on faith.  The only reason such conversations are even held is because it illustrates yet another bond being built between Lawrence and Holo... It's one of many examples of one teaching the other about their way of life, and the other finding a way soon afterwards to improve upon it through trust and mutual understanding.  Thus, even dialogue about fictitious currency never becomes boring.  conversations about church power and debt-related technicalities don\u2019t bother us or frighten us because we\u2019re shrewd financial experts who understand the ins and outs of trading, but because we care so much about Lawrence and Holo\u2019s future together.  The idea of Holo turning back to her wolf form and escaping into the wilderness to avoid the trouble that Lawrence brought upon himself isn\u2019t enough for us, even if we\u2019ve convinced ourselves that we love the show because of her.  It\u2019s not about Lawrence or Holo, it\u2019s about Lawrence AND Holo.\\n\\n\r\nYou can even point to their arcs being weirdly parallel to one another\u2019s.  They both made a commitment that led to them developing crippling loneliness, which caused them to share an immediate spark when they finally crossed paths.  They came together tentatively, having been burned before, make sacrifices for each other, challenge each other\u2019s pride, and find success as a team.  When that success comes crashing down due to their overconfidence, they both wind up prostrating themselves before the very people they thought themselves to be among the best of, with one begging for money and the other bowing for mercy, all for the sake of each other.  They each had long term plans to escape their lonely worlds, with Holo longing to return to her childhood home in the north and Lawrence planning to settle down and open his own shop, but both are forced to acknowledge that should these dreams ever come true, their time together will have to come to a bitter end.  These two characters were made for each other, which is why we root for them...  On their own, if Holo were to fade with the last few grains of wheat, or if Lawrence was to die in a coal mine, it wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal, as either could be considered a beautiful tragedy, but together, we want them to succeed...  They HAVE to succeed.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this focus on shipping over plot does, at times, create some plot related problems.  This issue can be glimpsed briefly in episode seven, which is technically an OVA, as it never aired on TV and was saved specifically for the DVD release.  It has almost no connection to any other episode aside from explaining how Holo got her new set of clothes, and can be skipped entirely with only that detail going unnoticed.  It contains no traveling, no plot, and can be seen almost as a bottle episode featuring the development of Lawrence and Holo\u2019s bond, and here\u2019s the major issue...  It\u2019s probably the best episode in the series.  It highlights the troubling issue of the plot, supporting characters and economic teachings being overshadowed by the strongest element of the series, which isn\u2019t anywhere close to the worst kind of execution, but it does feel a bit unfair, because all of those other elements are really good too, and deserve to have more acclaim than just being the backdrop of their own series.  It can make the plot a little hard to follow for anyone who isn\u2019t just investing their interests in the main romance, and that can be a problem for anyone trying to figure out certain plot points.\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf is available from Funimation on multiple formats, including an individual DVD set, a DVD/Bluray combo pack that includes the entire series, and a recently released Anime classics combo pack that\u2019s available for just around thirty dollars.  A second season is available from the same company, although it is a bit of a step down from the first season.  It was produced by a much more well known animation studio, and from what I\u2019ve been told, it deviates from the books with a made up an ending that\u2019s more than a little unsatisfying.  The series can also be viewed on Funimation.com and for free on Netflix.  The original light novels by Isuna Hasekura are available stateside in English through Yen press, and yes, all 17 volumes have been released.  In addition, 12 volumes of the manga adaptation have also been released stateside by the same company.\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf is an exemplary anime, simple in it\u2019s story and yet complex in it\u2019s characterizations.  It\u2019s been one of my top ten favorite series ever since I first saw it, so when it came time to review it as one of my seasonal offerings, I knew I\u2019d end up praising it and giving it a high score.  What I wasn\u2019t expecting, however, was that it would prove to be even better than I remembered.  I initially gave it a 9/10, believing it to be somewhat less than perfect, but I\u2019ll be honest with you guys, I struggled to come up with any noteworthy flaw.  You\u2019ve probably noticed how hard I was reaching to find something to complain about.  Yeah, It deviates a bit from the books, but only in good ways, like adding in a much needed episode seven, and swapping out a character from the novel with a much more interesting female counterpart named Chloe, whose inclusion added a lot of gravity to Holo\u2019s remark that Lawrence is easily fooled by women.  The quality is a bit lopsided, but I can hardly complain that one great element overshadowed several other good elements.  It\u2019s second season was a bit of a letdown, but that\u2019s not this season\u2019s fault.  It didn\u2019t even really need a second season, as the way it ended left you wasting more, but not needing more, and that\u2019s a pretty big difference.  All in all, I can\u2019t think of any significant reason to give this series anything less than an enthusiastic recommendation and a 10/10 score.",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf revolves around a traveling merchant Lawrence and a wolf spirit he meets, Horo.  It documents their journey through a fanciful medieval Europe on their way to Horo's homeland in the north.  They encounter problems along the way and have to work together to over come them; all the while building their relationship.\r\nStory\r\nThe single biggest drawback to this anime is the mundane plot.  The over arching story is simply an odd couple traveling from town to town on a journey north.  It isn&rsquo;t something that inspires the imagination.  Further, the side plots, the problems encountered in the varioustowns they visit, revolve around Lawrence and Horo getting caught up in shady but mundane business deals.  They aren&rsquo;t altogether uninteresting but they aren&rsquo;t anything special either.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem I have with the story is the lack of detail about Horo&rsquo;s past.  It would have been nice there were some back story introduced to give some idea of how she came to be in the situation that she was in at the beginning of the anime.  I haven&rsquo;t read the manga, so that may be why I have a hole in my knowledge about her past but reading the manga shouldn&rsquo;t be a requirement for information like this.  You only get a very vague idea of what Horo&rsquo;s past was like, which only makes me more curious as to the details.\\n\\n\r\nVery minor spoiler, the anime ends in a way that a second season is easily possible.  I am not aware of whether a second season is planned or not but if it is, I would expect the story to improve.\\n\\n\r\nBesides these negatives I have to admit the story did have some good features, particularly the universe in which the anime is set.  They have made a very good setting for the story and characters to interact in.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nI have very little to say about this topic.  The animation is beautiful.  It is well above average.  Watch the show and see it for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nI also have very little to say about this.  The ambient music is fitting for the setting and I particularly enjoy the opening.  Normally I skip an anime&rsquo;s opening to get straight to the story but in this case I listened to it every time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nThis is where this anime truly shines.  Do not watch Spice and Wolf for the plot, watch if for the character development and interaction.  Lawrence, Horo, and later Nora, are three very distinct and interesting characters with personalities that play well off each other.  I am not quite sure how to best describe it.  All three characters are very intelligent and likable.\\n\\n\r\nI think what impressed me the most is how realistic their personalities seem.  Their personalities are complicated and are not exaggerated.  It is very refreshing.  Most animes have over simplistic characters with extremely exaggerated personalities.\\n\\n\r\nThe way in which the characters&rsquo; relationships develop is also very well done.  Transitions in the characters&rsquo; interactions with one another are smooth.  Here are no abrupt changes in behavior or the state of a relationship.  Things are very fluid.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I like is that the characters reactions make sense.  That is to say, the characters act in a believable manner.  This may seem like a strange thing to praise an anime for but considering how fantastic other animes are, it makes this unique and praise worthy.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nWatching the character development is definitely the most entertaining part of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe action, when it occurs, is nothing spectacular.  The story is interesting enough to not be boring but will not captivate you.  This anime truly is all about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a 9.  It was my favorite anime of the 2008 winter season.  I am very critical of the story as it is rather mundane.  However, the characters are such that the plot is completely over shadowed.  The plot serves simply as a vehicle to move the character development along.\\n\\n\r\nI strongly recommend that you give this anime a try.\\n",

            "content": "This anime tried to save all the best features of light novel and even add more of them. Great music, great animation and harmony of every element - this is really a good work of \"Imagin\" studio. But still, they cut some details of plot and simplified Kraft character a little, which makes reading novel more preferable. So if you will like this anime, read novel and then watch it again to comprehend all the meaning of some moments and scenes. But now, if you're unfamiliar with Isuna Hasekura's works, I try to explain why this anime is near-to-perfect. \r\nSetting has his own rules differentfrom so many fantasy works and because of that story is frequently labeled as \"unique fantasy\". But on my opinion, setting is \u0430 try to reconstruct trading world of medieval Europe with least attention to themes of occultism and theology. Almighty Church appears just as economic and political force, but not the keeper of Holy Truth fighting with heresies. All what and overall thoroughness makes setting unusual, interesting and perfect background for adventures.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cSpice and Wolf\u201d is a story about travelling merchant (Kraft Lawrence) and goddess of harvest (Holo) making their way to the northlands, there Holo was born. But before they reach destination, they use every opportunity to get a coin, which makes trading the main driving force for the plot like battles in shonen. On the first watch, it takes some time to understand all details of complex deals and desperate proposals, but that is only advantage. Not every anime is able to set his audience thinking and trying to comprehend the true meaning of hero\u2019s action. \\n\\n\r\nThat is especially true because of interesting main characters, Holo and Lawrence, pagan goddess and simple man developing relationship. They are both fond of each other and just enjoy travelling together despite so many differences between them, and because of that they look like an excellent and natural pair. Although most times Holo just teasing Lawrence, there are times when she expresses her true feelings and shows all complexity of her personality, allowing him to understand the Wise Wolf. All that makes their dialogues extremely intriguing and hard to forget which serves an excellent surrounding to their adventures. \\n\\n\r\nBut the most pleasing is the harmony of the whole story in which every element is flawless. If setting or characters or plot wasn\u2019t on the same level of quality, the story may become much less attractive. Hopefully anime saves that splendid harmony of a story and even add same level music and visual style. Yoshino Yuuji compositions create right mood and they have strong bond with scenes where they used.  But still some of them sound more like music on certain theme: \u201cMatsuri no Uta\u201d create impression of festival where deception and fun intertwined, \u201cHikaru Wadachi\u201d sounds like good tavern theme and etc. Because of that soundtrack can be used as standalone album for everyday listening if you like instrumental and near-to-medieval music.\\n\\n\r\nIn sum, I just advice to watch this anime at any rate, because it is really unique masterpiece and you will not meet anything like it. In it you may find everything you wanted just like me and many others.",

            "content": "(A review for both seasons. I'm too lazy to be writing two reviews that say the exact same thing)\r\nThere are only two guarantees in life: death and taxes, and apparently there are too many shows revolving around death these days...\r\nThe story, while some might find it a little hard to keep up with, is very well written. It primarily follows Holo's journey to return to her home, while stopping off in every other town for Lawrence to try and pull another get-rich-quick ploy, with varying amounts of success. Most of the conflict arises primarily from these two points, with occasionally the all-powerful medieval Catholic churchcrushing down with their iron fists, or something of the like, to come in and make everything worse. Upon watching the series a second and even third time, I really picked up on little bits of foreshadowing and other intricacies scattered throughout each 6-7 episode long arc. The biggest weakness plotwise, however, is that its driven heavily by economics, a topic very few have a firm grasp on, and even fewer have a grasp on while also being a fan of anime. I was lucky a had a semester of economics classes under my belt and an accountant grandfather, otherwise I would've never understood what was going on. Others may not be so lucky, but as long as you understand that profit=good and debt=bad, you should be able to at least grasp when sh*t hits the fan, and when we're all good...hopefully...\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are a mixed bag. On the one hand, there's some very pretty background art and character designs, but the animation varies from passable to terrible (look up spice and wolf horse on youtube, you'll see what I mean). Beyond that, there isn't much else to talk about art/animation wise.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of what you hear, Spice & Wolf really starts to come into it's own. For starters, the first OP is some of the most relaxing listening I've ever experienced, while at the same time it still has the yearning emotions that match those felt in the anime perfectly. If you're a fan of so much as putting things in your ears, even if you don't plan on watching the show, please for the love of God (or Holo, or your other preferred deity) listen to Tabi no Tochuu at some point before you die. The second opening...while it's still...decent...pales in comparison to the first. Meanwhile, the ending themes have a very different vibe to them. They're much more simple and cutesy, and tie in much closer to the style of the rest of the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the soundtrack, while a lot of the songs are very hit-or-miss, the one thing the OST does well as a whole it does well is suit not just the mood, but also the style of the show perfectly. The majority of the show is about farmers, merchants, and other assorted god-fearing townsfolk simpletons, and the majority of the music is also kept very simple, usually only one or two instruments or voices, playing or singing fairly simple melodies, but amongst this they have a few hidden gems reserved for the complexity of the characters of Holo and Lawrence and the even more complex relationship between the two. The highlights to me include the bouncing, mischievous Kenshi no Yopparai and the harrowing vocal-driven track Kagen no Tsuki.\\n\\n\r\nThere's one more thing about the sounds in this show worth mentioning, and that is the absolutely gorgeous English dub. This show has made me look out for any dub where Brina Palencia is involved. Her portrayal of Holo does something very few dubs are able to do, and that is to actually add more to an anime in the English dub compared to watching it in Japanese with subtitles. I watched a couple of episodes in Japanese and Holo's voice seemed like little more than a 15-year-old Japanese girl with a hint of moe typical to Japanese anime dialogue. However, in the English dub, Brina delivers her dialogue with a formal style of language and a more mature tone that is a much better fit for Holo the Wise Wolf of Yoitsu. J Michael Tatum also does a very solid job as Lawrence, and there are also several good performances from the supporting cast, including cameos from such names as Monica Rial and Jamie Marchi.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest highlight in Spice & Wolf, however, is the wonderfully written characters. Holo is often regarded as one of the best-written female characters in anime, and having watched the show I can clearly see why, even despite being undeniably...well...a furry. Whatever you do, don't let the skeptics convince you that this is just pandering at furry fanservice because, while there is some nudity, particularly in the early episodes, there are so many more facets to her character that its almost impossible to not sit back and be completely sucked in by her charms anyway. However, in a series where Holo is the main attraction, Lawrence is certainly able to hold his own, and the interactions between the two of them are among my favourite things to bear witness to out of anything. Ever. The supporting cast is also, for the most part, very nicely done, although I must admit I found the characters in the second season a little less enjoyable to watch, but that took little away from the cast as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Spice & Wolf has a unique and incredibly well-written, if at times a little confusing, plot, and characters you're bound to love watching. The dub is excellent, and the art and music are lovely. The only downsides are some dull moments in the OST, inconsistent animation and some less likeable supporting characters in the second season. The plot might not be for EVERYBODY, but I personally would recommend this show as essential viewing to anyone who was looking for a more intellectual fare from their next series.\\n\\n\r\nNow then, I'm off to go read the light novels because OH YEAH DID I MENTION THE ANIME ONLY COVERS 4 OUT OF A TOTAL OF 17?! As a result, the anime's ending is...lackluster, and if the ending is paramount to you then that will obviously be a problem. To make things easier the anime essentially covers 1, 2, 3, and 5 so read book 4 before continuing on with the rest of the series.",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf, nearly perfect. \r\nPerfection was almost met but what it fell short at, for me, was lack of vibrance in character design. Do not take this absolutely literally, Holo(Horo) and Lawrence are vibrant in personality, and so is pretty much every minor character with more than 30 seconds of screen time. The lack I speak of is purely pencil to paper, while so much was put into everything and you could write a book on just describing Holo and Lawrence it seems the masterpiece which is was dulled with the art... at times.\r\nNow to get to it, it is a great anime thatcenters itself around speech and the relationship between a previously loner merchant and a deity of the land wishing to return to her homeland as she is no longer needed. The first arch focus' on the two getting to know one another and that is all I will say. The second focus' on Lawrence and his faults, as well as a little relationship whatnots that begin to take form between the two main people of this tale.This relationship is especially apparent in the OVA which is supposedly tied to season 2 as episode 00... but really its place is better suited as season 1 ova ep 14.\\n\\n\r\nI love it, and rushed immediately into season 2, it is absolutely worth the watch.",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf is quite a unique show. As the description might say, It is about a traveling merchant named Kraft Lawrence, who one day, traveling to a familiar town, runs into a local God known as Holo the Wise Wolf. They set off together, getting into an adventure that is worth the watch.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story is rather good, but the series a whole is very dialog heavy. The story does a very good job on taking you on an adventure with it. Most characters have a refreshing amount of detail to them, contrary to the plethora of anime with very shallow characters. Almost everimportant aspect of the story is quite memorable. There is quite a bit of dialog though, some might not remember every speck of it, but that does not mean it will keep you from enjoying each arc and every character met. The fact that that the story is very good, and the characters are memorable is why I give it a 9. The fact that not every aspect of the dialog is memorable, and sometimes hard to keep up with, is why it is not a 10. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nFirst of all, the art is above average. However, it is not quite on par with many anime of it's time. The backgrounds are quite stunning, this is where the art shines. The setting changes quite often, but the art of each one stays fresh, and is very well done. Although the characters and their movements are rather mediocre, them being placed in a nice setting, with most of the interactions being through talking, negotiating, and problem solving, it shows that average character animations can shine in an above-average setting with above-average story telling. There is very little fan-service in this show, there is quite a lot of nudity, but it is very tasteful, and not meant to sexually appease any fans. (Which I find refreshing.) Overall, the art is a solid 9. Gorgeous settings, with great characters and atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nOkay, this is where I feel the anime shines. First off, the OP and ED are AMAZING. Some of my favorites in all of anime. The OP is very calming, and sets the tone for the show very well, while the EP is absolutely adorable. The EP is one of my my all time favorites and makes you look at Holo the Wise Wolf in a very different way. The big question here though is, Subbed or Dubbed? Personally, I'd go for Dubbed. I usually go subbed in most occasions, but this is one of the few exceptions. the sheer amount of complex dialog itself is a major reason, but the English voice actors are GREAT. J. Michael Tatum voicing the English version of Kraft Lawrence is beyond amazing, he is known for others like Okabe Rintorou, the main characters of Steins;Gate (My all time favorite anime) and many others. He is an amazing voice actor and makes the dub worth it by himself. Of course the translations can get a bit cheesy every now and then, there is no point in the anime that I find Subbed was much better than Dubbed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nNot much to say here, other than most characters are great, and have an above average depth to them compared to other anime. Many shows now have a tendency to show complex characters, with very non-complex traits. In Spice and Wolf most of the characters you meet have a more-than-meets the-eye tendency to them. Without spoiling to much, I'll let you meet the characters yourself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 \\n\r\nThis is probably where most opinions of this show diverge. There is a FAR above average amount of dialog in this show, and it is mostly about economics, and trading policies. If you are into a unique perspective of story (Like myself) I'm almost positive you will love the story. If you are into much simpler stories, I'm almost positive you'll dislike the story. It's as simple as that. The story has unique plot after unique plot, I find this very enjoyable, time and time again. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nAfter all that's said and done, this anime is not perfect, but is far beyond most. Almost every aspect of it is great, but the few things keeping it from being perfect is why it is not a 10. I would love to give this show a perfect score, but it is not a perfect show. It is also not for everyone. If you enjoy complexity, there is almost no doubt that you will love this show. If you don't like complexity, why are you watching anime?",

            "content": "Although I have seen both seasons, this is a review of just the FIRST SEASON. \r\nI recall in one anime (I believe it was Oregairu/SNAFU) the main character mentioned \"On some journeys, it is best to take it alone.\" After watching Spice and Wolf, you will not believe that to be true. Sometimes having a great companion to be at your side along your journey makes the trip even better.\r\nA friend recommended me to watch this anime but I placed it near the bottom of my list to watch. I thought that a relationship between a human and a human-wolf would be very strange andif handled improperly, the story would become awful (hey there Twilight). It was not until I saw it listed on a  review of best romantic anime video on YouTube (I believe it was TheBlackCriticGuy's video) that I sought it out online. After watching the first few episodes, I couldn't believe that I waited so long to watch it! I was instantly hooked. \\n\\n\r\nNow, onto the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nWow. Where do I begin? The setting of the story is somewhere in Europe during the Middle Ages. In this era, the Church held the strongest power and science was considered heresy. Spice and Wolf utilizes this historical setting to tell its tale with great effect. I really enjoy when an author chooses to use a historical time period to tell their story because the setting has done most of the work in establishing a foundation and all the author needs to do is to write a story that can weave its way through that foundation If you really enjoy stories that take place during real time periods, this is definitely an anime worth checking out.\\n\r\nEnough about the setting. What about the story of our characters? Honestly, the story line is very simple. Lawrence, a merchant, happened to stumble upon a Goddess, Holo, and they go on a trading journey together. They use their wits (but mostly Holo has the cunning ideas) to reap large amounts of profit. Some people may find their dealings very confusing and possibly a deterrent, as Lawrence and Holo deal with somewhat complicated economic matters. This is probably where the anime fell a little bit short in failing to appeal to a broader audience. However, I enjoyed understanding what the characters were trying to say not only because I like these trading matters, but also because it is through these moments that we get to see the characters' personalities and also see them develop a relationship between one another.\\n\r\nThe anime, like everyone else mentioned, is VERY dialogue heavy. In fact, Holo and Lawrence develop their relationship through their witty bantering. I absolutely loved their lines. So, if you do not enjoy dialogue heavy anime, Spice and Wolf may not be for you. However, if you are able to look past the dialogue (and ignore some of the complicated economic speak), Spice and Wolf will be an absolute blast for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nI am not familiar with the development of anime technology but considering that this was done in 2008, the artwork is stunning. I think it even rivals UFOTable's Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night UBW artworks (though since those were action-based, they get the better edge). The colours are nice and subdued but not to the extent that a scene feels dull. Also, I felt that each frame was carefully selected to have the angle capture the scene's atmosphere and the character's feelings. Bravo to the artists!!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nLet me say this: one does not skip the opening of Spice and Wolf. The opening is a perfect mood setter as it captures the mature relationship between Lawrence and Holo. The background music of the anime was also superb. The composer chose a Renaissance style since you can hear the recorders playing during festive scenes. Further, I absolutely loved the string accompaniment. String instruments can faithfully capture the wide range of emotions that a character can feel, let it be stress or love. My ears definitely loved the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe opening animation to Spice and Wolf can be pretty deceiving because you see a lot of characters appear. However, the story mainly focuses on Lawrence and Holo. \\n\\n\r\nHolo has become my favourite female lead in anime (though as of this writing, Inaban in my profile pic might get very upset...). What she brings to the table is her upbeat personality and her absolutely cute moments with Lawrence. Further, the dialogue between Lawrence and Holo is absolutely fantastic. There is not a moment where you want to yawn when you hear these characters talk. At any time, Holo could flash a sarcastic remark and you would be left wondering how Lawrence would respond to it. Sometimes, he fails but that's what makes these moments enjoyable. Gosh, there can't be a better anime couple than these two. \\n\\n\r\nThe story also treats Holo and Lawrence's relationship in a very mature manner. We don't get any slapstick humour moments or ridiculous events where Lawrence is the shining knight saving Holo who is the damsel in distress. None of that. Instead, we get a couple who support each other, offer their companionship to each other, and love each other at a very spiritual level.\\n\\n\r\nThe only negative side to Spice and Wolf is its treatment of its side characters. They appear in their own story arc but it feels like as soon as Holo and Lawrence leave the town, those characters leave the show as well. You can argue that it is reflective of Middle Age European society because there is not much migration between towns so it is highly likely that when someone settles down, they settle down. I did hope that we could see some more development of certain side characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI haven't had the pleasure of watching a show (anime or live action) where there was such great chemistry between the lead characters. Honestly, everyone in the story is like background noise and the main stage lights are centered upon Lawrence and Holo. \\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf: you did an outstanding job! I definitely recommend this anime to everyone who loves strong character development, witty dialogue, and don't mind some complicated economics talk.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this rather long review!\\n",

            "content": "This review is for both Season 1 and 2 of Spice and Wolf.  I'm going to run through this starting with the bad and ending with the fantastic.  So don't read half and pass judgement on the show without reading my full review.  Hold onto your coins, let's make a bargain!\r\nStory (3/10) - So to begin with, we have the story of SnW.  It starts off with Holo (a Pagan wolf demi-god girl) and Kraft Lawrence (a travelling merchant) meeting up in the very beginning, and then follows them along their journey as she seeks to travel with him while heis wheeling and dealing.  Along the way they get into a little trouble with some unfortunate business deals and have a bit of adventure, and Holo eats/drinks all of Lawrence's money away.  The story itself is honestly not great.  It gets super detailed with the business dealings in an attempt to make them seem complicated, is paced very slowly, and tries so hard to be high brow that it physically hurts.  It's just very pretentious and dull at times.  There's brief moments of respite when some action scenes develop, but they are generally there for the outcome and not the event.  It has potential at times to get you interested, especially with the introduction of various side-characters, but it never fully realizes that potential.  The story does its job of providing a backdrop, but really lets itself down in trying to grab the reader's attention.\\n\\n\r\nSound (4/10) - The soundtrack to this show is... repetitive.  I'm sure many people love the OST for this show, but it is just not something I could get into.  Celtic music and bagpipes are okay for a while, but when they reuse the *same* 3-4 tracks over and over and over again, it gets very monotonous.  I will say I enjoyed the music for a little bit, it wasn't bad per say, but once I'd heard it for the 10th time, it got very tired and played out.  The composer of the music never took any risks with the sound of this show.  They found a stylistic niche and held onto it like a man holding onto a twig in a hurricane.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10) - The art is one of the better points for the show.  It isn't consistent necessarily, and it isn't the best art you'll ever see, but there is definitely some quality there and at times it can look fantastic.  It gets marks for being better than average, but not necessarily by much because it.  Much like the soundtrack, isn't treading any ground that hasn't already been trodden.  I also found it odd that Holo almost seemed more styled after a fox than a wolf, but I digress.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10) - The characters are the high point of this show.  I would actually give this category an 11/10 if that were possible.  Despite many of the other shows weaknesses, the characters Holo and Lawrence and their endearing relationship are what carry this whole series.  Their at times awkward but heart-warming interactions are honestly some of the best I've seen in an anime to date.  They feel oddly relateable.  Holo can often be haughty and arrogant, but her vulnerabilities are apparent despite how she tries to hide them.  Lawrence can often seem confident during dealings, but you can quickly see the cracks in that confidence whenever Holo is around.  It is just so wonderfully human that it can't help but bring a huge smile to your face during their constant quibbling, and sadness when they have a falling out.  It really is something truly amazing to behold.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) - I had a hard time wrestling with how I felt about this show in terms of enjoyment.  As I said before, it just seems so pretentious and dull at times that it was hard to stomach, the business dealings and music quickly become stale and my will to watch would wane, but then Holo and Lawrence would start talking to one another and I'm sucked right back in with a huge grin and an inexplicable feeling of joy.  I was torn between a 7 and an 8, but honestly, I know I would certainly be content for a 3d season run, so I feel an 8 is solidly deserved.\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf is a truly bizarre show to me.  I don't think I've ever viewed a piece of media before where I found it lacking in so many areas, but one singular piece of it was just so amazing that I completely forgot about the rest of it.  It is really something special and memorable because of it.  This show isn't for everyone, but for people looking for some really compelling characters and a well developed love story, Spice and Wolf has you covered.  I give the show a 7/10 when I tally up my scores, but for what it is worth, I really *wish* I could rate it higher overall because of how much I loved the characters.  Take that as you will, and make some money out of it ;P",

The first episode caught my attention, I wasn't sure if it was going to be a very romantic series or what. To me the series had some romantic parts, but I wish the characters would've been a little more forward about it.\r\nI couldn't really say if I liked Lawrence or not. For a guy who comes up with some kind of saying for every situation. I'm not really sure whether he was super dense when it came to romantic situations or whether he was super sly about it.But I gotta give it to him for never losing composure, when he was in a tough spot.\\n\\n\r\nWhat would you do if you had a wolf girl in the back of your cart?\\n\\n\r\nNow as for Holo, besides her being super cute. She had a good personality, always teasing Lawrence every second of the day or spending all his money on food. When it came down to it, Holo tried in her own way to show her appreciation towards Lawrence. Such as. using sneaky tricks to help Lawrence get a little extra money.\\n\\n\r\nI'd say this is a pretty good romance anime, if you're really into those, but as for me a wish there would've been a more clear cut romance between the two. Instead of just beating around the bush. But all in all it was a good show and I thoroughly enjoyed it.\\n",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf is not your typical romance. However that is in fact why it is one of the best I've ever seen. With knights and mythical creatures roaming the planet during the dark ages, the story strays far from your stereotypical high school setting. Which let's be honest... Is a breath of fresh air. Not only that, but the execution is so flawless you will be persuaded that the author experienced these moments their self.\r\nThe main character Lawrence is a traveling merchant. So a significant portion of the story is devoted to trading, bartering, currency exchanging, and also conversations about the historical and politicalrelationships between the church and the monarchy. (kings/queens) \\n\\n\r\nNot to mention it has very heavy dialogue. Which can be uninteresting at times I admit. So I advise watching at your own pace. This may not be one of the best binge watch series due to its excessive dialogue, but rather something you take your time to enjoy like a fine wine.\\n\\n\r\nThe main appeal of this anime is the interactions between the characters Lawrence and Holo. Their witty conversations about life and philosophy, accompanied by subtle flirting and teasing, is the main reason why I was so captivated by their countless adventures. These love birds share by far the best chemistry I've ever witnessed in any anime. Even to a point where they seem to be non-fictional.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also outstanding. With festive tunes during the times of celebration contrasted by bone chilling symphonies during times of chaos. This flavorful and unique music will heighten your experience and aid you in relishing every moment. I actually listen to the OST's while doing household chores even to this day. \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend checking out the soundtrack even if you decide to not watch the anime. However, that would be your loss because this is a must watch for any romance lover out there. After completing over 500+ anime please take my word on it. This couple and their adventures will steal your heart in no time. ;)",

Holo is the type of character crafted to trap the viewer during the display. The temperamental features and intelligent lines of the character captivated me from the start. It is a character without the vices found in most of the anime characters.\r\nLawrence is different. Like other male characters he is more assertive, but still as silly as the others.\r\nSecondary characters and supporting characters are well presented and always play a significant rolewhen they appear.\\n\\n\r\nThe intelligent speeches of the characters always refer to very realistic situations in the relationship between people. Holo, for example, makes people forget that she is a wolf, however much her ears are always on display.\\n\\n\r\nThe drama is well-crafted. There is always a problem to be solved. The problems that appear are always well introduced, and because they are very similar to real problems, they have always been able to convince me and get me involved.\\n\\n\r\nThe negatives are due to the low visual quality, although I find the design of the characters very beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nI am very satisfied with this work and I always review what I can.",

            "content": "When you see a preview or a trailer of something nowadays, you\u2019d think that there\u2019s more to the material first shown than meets the eye. Someone who hasn\u2019t read the comic sees the action-packed trailer for \u201cWatchmen\u201d and thinks it\u2019s an epic action movie. Instead he leaves the theater from witnessing a 2 and a half hour philosophy lecture from a naked blue man. Such is not the case with Spice and Wolf.\r\n\tHaving yet to read the novels and being intrigued by the FUNimation trailer, I dived into the show expecting a fish out of the water story about a Wolf-goddess meeting a humble(ish) peddlerselling junk in medieval times, and got just that. 90% of the story\u2019s focus is ever present on this unlikely couple and is fortunately where the series\u2019 beauty lies.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe story\u2019s general protagonist, Craft Lawrence is what you\u2019d expect to see after Haruhi Suzumiya\u2019s Kyon grew up during medieval times. And in being that witty, cynic, he has one drive- make enough money to open up shop. Which is why I found it all so surprising, as well as all-around plot-driven, when he (somewhat) nonchalantly accepted the fact that his companion throughout the series is a wolf-girl. \\n\\n\r\n\tAnd here is where we get to talk about that the aforementioned beauty- Holo the Wise Wolf. A personification of the word snarky, every aspect of her character feels as real as the character can get. While watching, I noticed certain traits of her persona: adorable, snooty, needs comfort, can handle dirty work on her own, moe, tsundere. \\n\\n\r\nAnd this, perhaps, is the origin of her genuine character. So many anime romances overplay the plague that is the tsundere, moe, and yandere clich\u00e9 that one may find it sickening to the point where they don\u2019t want anything to do with romance anime anymore. This is where Holo\u2019s multi-personal qualities come in, full of ironic glory of being a wolf-girl, as well as one of the few female anime characters to actually seem realistic and true to her character.\\n\r\nOh and did I mention her tail is gorgeous? Seriously\u2026. Don\u2019t screw with the tail. \\n\\n\r\n\tAdd up both of these characters together, as well as some excellent relationship pacing, the likes of which I have not seen much in anime, and you get one brilliant, if romance. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the anime is not without flaws. While the two main characters are well presented, most of the remaining cast does not have much value about them. Much of them are never even seen again, without even concluding they\u2019re stories or even giving a purpose for them to be in the story. Nonetheless, the supporting characters\u2019 blandness and fleeting appearances somewhat fits the show\u2019s plot, as the two major characters travel to the north meeting new faces one day and saying good bye to them the next. In spite of this, the story\u2019s economic \"action, so to speak, is not one of its best forte. While some transactions can be amusing and witty, others can be pretty far fetched, and deal more on the psychological domain of busisness rather than actual transaction. On another perspective, this isn't exactly bad, as Holo's and Lawrence's \"mind games\" with people can be pretty entertaining.  \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is of very decent quality as well. There are some scenes in particular where she makes expressions at Lawrence, and looks as wolfish as she does her true form. However, there\u2019s not much to say about it other than Holo\u2019s highly characteristic expressions.  It looks good, and is overall quite consistent, but nothing that makes your mouth drop. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound, on the other hand, I found to be very well done. The opening and ending themes contrast in a very interesting way. Tabi no Tochuu by Kiyoura Natsumi, offers a very mellow and melancholic tone to the show during each episode, while the ending, Ringo Biyori by Rocky Chack, may perhaps be the most upbeat and, at the same time, oddest piece of music I have ever listened to; at least in the context of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors also do the characters justice for the most part. Brina Palencia and Michael J. Tatum both play the main roles very well, especially the former who vocally brings Holo to life, while the rest of the cast is also well done by many familiar FUNimation VA\u2019s. I can\u2019t say much about the seiyu, however, as I have only watched the English dub, but with Jun Fukuyama\u2019s name in the credit\u2019s under \u201cCraft Lawrence\u201d, I expect it is as well acted as the dub. \\n\\n\r\n While the score fits the era of the series very well, giving the show a very fitting medieval feel, there\u2019s not much to say about the soundtrack on its own as, individually, it is generally forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is a largely enjoyable story to experience, and I very much recommend this anime to all who would want to let their minds wander from the traditional \u201cmoe blob\u201d and \u201cshounen\u201d anime, and experience something new.\\n\\n\r\nI, for one, will gladly embark on the remaining journey with Lawrence and Holo with the second season of the show and the light novels in the future.",

            "content": "After watching this anime, I have one piece of advice for all those who have not seen this anime before:\r\nBuy lots of apples before you get too far in this anime. Yes, APPLES! You will crave it not too far into Spice and Wolf!!! Trust me. \r\nI'll wait here until you go buy some.\r\nGot them? Good! Now on to the actual review:\r\nSpice and Wolf is a pretty unique class of anime. It can practically stand in most genres: it's a comedic romance featuring historical backgrounds mixed with fantasy and suspense related to economy/financial problems, with the sense of family, belonging, loneliness, and homesickness amidst all.\r\nUhhI probably didn't make much sense there. Let me explain :)\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around a young man named Lawrence who is a traveling merchant in the medieval era. His job is pretty bland to us, since all he does is sell, buy, travel, repeat. Fortunately, we meet the next protagonist fairly quickly, a wolf named Holo.\\n\\n\r\nHolo is the story driver in this anime. She's a wolf who has lived more years than Lawrence could imagine, a wolf who wants to return home. All of the arcs in the plot revolve around her, since...well, she's a wolf!\\n\\n\r\nThe primary focus of this anime, and this series (if you watch the second season), is romance. However, this isn't just regular romance. It's the type where you, the audience, has to figure things out by yourself. There are absolutely no internal dialogue revealed, and the watchers must conclude from the characters' actions and face expressions how they are feeling, what they are thinking, etc. One of the reasons this anime succeeded was because it was so REAL--instead of giving us the ability to probe deep into the characters' thoughts, we were simply placed there, in the middle of the story, expected to understand what was going on through physical observations. \\n\\n\r\nBecause of this, there's a lot of dialogue here. But you will welcome the dialogue, I guarantee it. They are very purposeful--not many things are mere fillers. Dialogue either tells us more about the personalities and the character development of a person, or explain a sticky situation, or make us laugh, or keep us in suspense.\\n\\n\r\nEnough of the story. I'm afraid I might spoil something accidentally.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is simply AMAZING. It puts you right in the setting--appropriate music comes on at appropriate times. There are lots of moments where the music puts a humorous color to the scene, foreshadowing a witty joke, and there are times when you sense the seriousness of the situation just by the music.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and voice acting were fantastic as well. First off, Holo is so kawaii! Apart from her personality, her voice immediately puts me in a jokingly good mood. Why? Her tone often has this...tinge of mischief and humor in it. Lawrence is quite the handsome man as well, considering all the other male characters weren't as appealing as he was. The scenery is very nicely portrayed. The drawings of the apples, and their depiction of Holo eating was so good they made me buy apples the day after watching this. It just looked so delicious. And I used to hate apples, too.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, unlike most anime watchers, I give my animes ratings based on my enjoyment. No matter how good or bad the plot was, character development was, etc, I judge animes based on how much I enjoyed them. And I give this anime a proud 9, ONLY because I felt that the second season deserved a 10 since it gave more enjoyment. It's definitely an anime worth watching, although you have to get used to the dialogue-driven plot in the beginning. Good luck!!\\n\\n\r\n-Icesica\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review covers Season One, the bridge OVA and Season Two.\r\nYou can buy meetings, but you can't choose their quality. Words of marketing brilliance that ring no matter your profession. So when a fateful encounter with another person occurs, not matter the barter cost, it's one to be treasured.\r\nSpice and Wolf seems to run parallel story lines of business and romance that both fall under a slice of life category. Countless times the two sides cross paths but almost always come out bad for business. With the second season playing out more casually than the first, it was almost a disappointment that they both endedthe same way but under different circumstances. The first season could not have been played out better while the second season lacked the same thrill.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is that of a typical pre industrial revolutionary anime setting with a strong European style influence. It makes for much beautiful scenery but at the same time can instantly make for an ominous, back water town, style in the quick turn of a corner. Lighting effects are used to a great extent to add a certain feel to many scenes and really do add to the over all environment on both a small scale conversation, to the larger scale environmental setting of a town or city.\\n\\n\r\nWhile scenery music is used a lot throughout both seasons, it was far more predominant in the first than the latter season as everything from a thick, tense atmosphere to a cheerful humor scene had an addition of music where as the second season still had it, but far less for the latter, which made for more bleak humor.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as character development goes, both seasons played separate parts. The first playing more of an introduction to the main hero and heroine and their early journey, while the second season was far more focused on the relationship of the two. We learn very little about the past of either main character, but it seemed to be irrelevant as what is learnt is deemed sufficient as their past is something their past is not something of an easy topic for either of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is where the story story lines come back into the fray. In both business tactics and as a romance anime, many will find great amusement out of Spice and Wolf as their wits are sharp about their marketing but their intimacy is something that is forever growing but always poked at. Humor on both accounts is strongly present in the first season while in the second its more on the marketing side while the relations of the two take a more serious turn, for better or for worse.",

            "content": "Overall: Spice and Wolf is a very nice kind of alternative to watch compared to most of the mainstream series out there, It does a very good job in keeping me entertained, though there is a large amount of dialog to explain situations however, I do have to say they didnt actually \"finish\" the story, the series cuts off at the end leaving me wanting more, hopefully there will be a continuation. I would have actually given a 10/10 if they finished the story, but 13 episodes is nowhere near enough for this kind of anime to finish.\r\nStory: there actually wasnt much action on partof the main plot, but their adventures proved to be very interesting, showing more about each of the main characters with each episode, though the series felt like it was ended somewhat abruptly story wise, besides that, the story arcs proved very entertaining so it deserves praise for what it has.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Very good quality art in my opinion, the environments were usually pretty rich and colorful.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening is pretty catchy though its slow, and the ending is just weird, but the music in the background really helped in setting the mood usually.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: there wasnt much time to really do any character development, since it is only about 12 episodes (non-dvd) and the side characters never really stood out that much, but it felt like I knew Horo and Lawrence pretty well, and they showed that they are pretty deep characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed watching this series, it kept me tuned in throughout the entire duration. It is a shame that it only lasts 12 or 13 episodes, this series really deserves a continuation because of how well done it was, at least in my opinion.",

            "content": "Alright Spice and Wolf is a quite interesting anime I must say... \r\nSTORY \r\nThe story is within itself VERY different from normal animes. It is set in the medieval era so things with knights and farmers and noblemen are all present. So you might think Spice and Wolf is a anime about a knight that meets a wolf or maybe a brave man setting out to do great things... NOPE its all about a peddler.. What does he do. He peddles he peddles so hard its crazy how hard he peddles his goods. Id even say its down right sexy how he manages the goodstrade in this show. The show has its own economic system with its own market and form of money with its money values and all of it is explained in the show. Which surprisingly enough knowing how the economy and money system works really made me like the world its set in. It really gave me a basis on what the main character does for a living. This anime is VERY wordy so if you have the attention span of a fly or maybe you just like seeing blood gore and medieval sword play then you might want to look somewhere else. Also for those looking for a very gory or magical show such as trolls and goblins and of course body parts flying you wont find any...Of course the show does have a little bit of magic but you'll have to watch and find out. This is a love anime by the way but it does it VERY well. \\n\\n\r\nARTWORK \\n\r\nWell to me it fits the setting nicely. The people are all varied and the animation is as good as the show needs it to be. That and I personally love the medieval setting so for me I felt right at home. Although I have a slight issue with the way the main character Lawrence is drawn.. Its mostly due to his hair because it is gray and because of that I have trouble telling exactly how old he is. But besides that issue I freaking loved it.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS \\n\r\nNow I am very big on character development. Its the only thing I stress about in every show I watch. Now the two characters we are working with in Spice and Wolf are Lawrence and his partner Holo. They have a very interesting and good personality. There chemistry works very well with each other and I found myself saying \"Awwww dat be so kawaii\" That and you will get invested with the way characters sell things.. To the point where you will begin to understand the economy and business. I not only found myself enjoying the way the two characters just talked to each other and interacted but I loved how they would sell things and work with the cool economic system and get the most bang from there buck and turning profits. Something that sounds very boring but is very fun. So much fun I actually thought I wanted to become a traveling merchant one day. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL \\n\r\nIf you have a open mind and love weird anime that do different things. If you don't mind love and wonderful trading. Watching deals go down before your very eyes to see how people plan to get there money back. If you dont mind a lack of violence and a lack of blood and gore and you like long wordy conversations with interesting characters then this is the anime for you!!!\\n\\n\r\n10/10 \\n\\n\r\nAlso this is my first  review so please tell me if I made a mistake anywhere and judge me accordingly thank you ^_^",

This show is extremely story driven, and the plot is not your run of the mill spell slingers/melee masters versus dark lords/demons/evil beings. It's all about economy and the wandering merchants, and most of the story is derived from trading, travelling, and the subtle spurring romance of Lawrence and Holo.\r\nIt has a very intelligent storyline, with quirky humor and witty dialog, and you really have to pay attention. I would have liked to have seen the character interactions developed a little more, and possibly some of the christian/pegan themes explored further, but they dida great job with how the main characters are developing their feelings for one another. It's a great story overall.\\n\\n\r\nHighly recommended.",

I won't do a resume of the story because you can already read the synopsis on the Spice and wolf page. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art is outstanding, Villages feels lively and same could be said about background  now the only bad thing is the animation which is pretty mediocre at best but I will give it a slack because it's a 2007/2008 anime and the director directed hentai not anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic- 10 \\n\\n\r\nThe music fits perfectly the theme and is enjoyable I even bought the OST\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10\\n\\n\r\nNow this is the reason why you want to watch spice&wolf the development between our two main protagonist is astonishing and every character as is background but it's not really exploited in the anime like it is in the LN when you watch the anime you will be transported into their world the conversation between characters is fluid and doesn't feel forced at all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is my favorite series and caution at the end you will feel depressed that their is no season 3 so I would recommend buying the Light novels which are at least 10 times better thanks for reading :)",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf.\r\nNow this is how romance in animes should be dealt with. I was kinda hesitant at first to watch it as I don't like romance focused stuff but boy does this anime deliver on that front in a fresh way. \r\nThe story is good and its progression is great. If the story would be the main focus then characters would not stand out so much and this show focuses on the characters. The old times setting and merchant background story is perfect for a journey/adventure.\r\nits a 2 person adventure and my GOD i love it!\r\nThe protagonist is a likable kind hearted merchant whois really good in what he does and has a mind for profit. His thinking is analytical, always weighing Then there is Holo, the female main character of the anime, who I think is one of the best female anime characters I have seen. She is wise, intelligent, funny and witty, did i mention i want to cuddle her to death? And she is in no way annoying, which is always a great thing because female characters in animes, especially romantic ones, tend to have fake/silly elements(when sometimes written by a guy a female character gets less attention or the wrong attention). The story between the two main characters is handled masterfully. Both of them undergo a lot of character development and have diverse personalities that you can't help but enjoy it. The anime focuses on merchant stuff too. Trading, currencies, techniques, stock prices etc etc. Its all very detailed in the show. But if you dont like that sort of thing dont worry because its not the main focus of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack was really fitting. Some of the emotional scores and the comedy ones were GREAT. \\n\\n\r\nNow here is the thing.. if i was not biased i would probably give this a 8 or maybe 9. But what i love most in a show is a journey with people who just talk about interesting stuff and have good chemistry and is relaxing but still clever so you never want it to end. i give it a 10 because my enjoyment is most important. if this show never dropped in quality and they made a episode every week i would watch it for the rest of my life. thats just my personal opinion though i doubt there are many people who would give it perfect score.\\n\\n\r\nPerfect for me though! - 10!\\n",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf, one I started a long, long time ago, dropped it thinking nothing good would happen and then later found out the good stuff came the episode after I dropped it. What I found was that there a much different kind of action in this anime than what you might think, and I can't tell if I'm disappointed or not.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nBasically you're following the partnership of Lawrence the merchant and Holo the wolf goddess. You'd think you're in for a whole world of magic and action and cleverness, right? WRONG. The story instead take a route where the main premise of theanime is Lawrence's activities as a merchant and a peddler. Basically, it's episode after episode of him and his cohorts explaining the many facets of the economy and different methods of money making, while Holo sits around and only does anything when a convenient way out is needed. In some ways, it's a bit of a let down, however, concerning the money matters, it's not half bad if you're good at sitting back and listening. Unless you've spent years studying what Lawrence knows, you're in for a ton of different turns and twists in the plot, and some of the problems and instances of problem solving are pretty clever.\\n\r\nAs well, the series does a good job of managing time and ending it in such a way that you're satisfied, and I believe it's a good transition into  the second season. All in all, the story is decent, unique even, but not completely enrapturing. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 4/10\\n\r\nThe art is pretty painful to look at, given the characters are mostly drawn like the first product of someone who just got a How to Draw Manga book. Big eyes, sloppy shadows, awkward age lines on the older characters. The background is nothing special either, so nothing to give a gold star to there.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6/10\\n\r\nThe opening song really does a good job of suiting the anime it's introducing; it has the same feel as the show, even if it gives off a bit of a gloomy vibe. It's a nice change from the erratic j-pop that usually accompanies what I've been watching lately. Additionally, the ending is catchy as hell, and maybe it's because it's English and easy to sing along. Not too peppy, but still a nice tune to it. During the show, sometimes the shift from one bit of music to another is a bit rough; it usually happens suddenly like in a video game where if you get close to the boss the battle music suddenly starts and you know what's coming. It's tolerable, but a bit irritating at times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7/10\\n\r\nI think what's most refreshing is how the main guy is actually smart and useful as opposed to being a forgettable nuisance that gets dragged around by the love interest. The love interest herself is another story; while she's clever and interesting to watch, she sort of comes off as a great big mary sue. There is never a single fault to anything she does, and she's basically capable of escaping any situation without a scratch, while remaining smart, snarky and attractive. It reminds me of those OC's thirteen year old girls write about, and her performance comes off as uncomfortable given her utter lack of flaw. The supporting cast is pretty forgettable, but it's understandable given the whole anime has been worked around to make Holo the mary sue the center of the universe. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\r\nI basically watched it to clear up part of my On Hold list, but I didn't mind finishing it up. As long as you don't mind a big bit of reading, episode-to-episode isn't such a bad experience--just don't look away or you'll miss a chunk of technical jargon you'll probably need to get what's going on. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's not a bad anime, but it comes off as someone's middle school try at a novel, where the characters are catered to a bit too much and the accompanying drawings are amateurish at best. It's a good beginner anime for people who want to getting into more complicated stuff that requires you to think about, or just a beginner anime in general. There is romance, but it's not obnoxious, and the easy going way it's handled is pretty refreshing. Don't get your hopes up if you thinks it's going to go big on the supernatural end though, you're in for a big disappointment there.",

            "content": "Note : This review is for seasons 1 & 2.\r\nRomance, comedy and fantasy. Three of the most overused elements in anime. Making a series which seems familiar while successfully avoiding the cliches that riddle the rom-com genre is almost unthinkable. Yet, that is exactly what Spice and Wolf does.\r\nThe story is set sometime in the middle ages when the human civilization was still using metal currencies. This is a fact that the viewer is made painfully aware of during the first 'arc'. I say 'painfully' for a reason. Since Lawrence is a merchant, there are a lot of technical concepts and terms relating to medivialmercantilism. This can make the plot hard to follow at times. But it is masterfully crafted to produce the atmosphere of the setting nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nThe area in which the anime excels however, is character development. The protagonists in this series unlike most rom-coms feel human. They are not some random characters who fall for each other on first sight. The chemistry between Holo and Lawrence improves gradually.in a very satisfying manner. one can easily perceive the character \\n\r\ngrowth by simply observing the way they communicate with each other. While their interactions are very satisfying, it is Holo who really brings this anime to life. Her mischievously regal nature is quite apparent thanks to sugar-coated admonitions and a convoluted manner of speech. In this respect, her moe character design is very misleading. My only \\n\r\ncomplaint about this centuries old goddess is her debauchery, which seems a little uncanny for a 'wise' wolf. But it is for the most part, excusable.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting and ost are excellent. I haven't watched the original Japanese version, but the English dub is exceptional. Palencia Brina amiably captures the subtleties of Holo's personality. Tatum J. Michael also does a very good job as Lawrence. Given that this series has a western feel to it, watching the dub would be apt. The ost has a collection of delightful tracks which sound fittingly medieval and are a pleasure to listen to. It is unfortunate that the music does not receive as much emphasis as it should.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are by no means extraordinary, but they serve the series adequately. The character desigins are likewise \\n\\n\r\ndone very well. Holo's design is particularly captivating, it is the perfect blend between a human and a wolf, quite unlike the cat eared women I have become accustomed to seeing in anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would recommend it to everyone who wishes to escape the hustle and bustle of mainstream anime and immerse themselves in an imaginative world with colorful, yet surprisingly realistic characters. This is an anime which you are bound to enjoy regardless of whether you like rom-coms or not. Keep in mind however, that this an incomplete series.",

There are some highly entertaining scenes between them ^_^ I cannot think of any other anime character that comes close to being anything like Horo, personality wise. She is a wolf god in human form, who has a love for apples. Horo really is adorable, with her tail and wolf ears. I think everyone would have a hard time notliking her. \\n\\n\r\nShe is also known as Horo the Wise! With her great intuition, she can tell when people are lying most of the time. This is a part of why the economic aspect of the series is so enjoyable, whereas I thought I would be bored by all the technical talk. It really was not too hard to follow.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the actual story, Spice and Wolf tells of the journey Lawrence and Horo take to the north. Several things happen along the way. I gave it an extra point for the unique focus on economics. \\n\\n\r\nThe music wasn't all that memorable, except for both the opening and ending songs. The OP was great, I don't think I ever skipped it. I enjoyed the ED with its catchy tune and use of engrish. I do remember the background music fitting the setting of the series. The animation was just great\\n\\n\r\nThe way it ends suggests that there will be a second season airing sometime in the future. This will not be the last we see from Horo the Wise!\\n\\n\r\nThis is a great watch for people who like smart insightful anime and romantic comedies, as Spice and Wolf is able to bring those two together in a good way. A great anime series 9/10",

There's good, and then there's the kind of good that keeps me up past my bedtime and forces me to try & ration the episodes out over a few days. This is one of those, though not for the usual reasons.\r\nExcellent, subtle characterization and, as others have mentioned, sophisticated dialog are strengths.  I found myself grinning in delight many times at the banter between Holo and Lawrence, especially enjoying the voice acting on the English dub.\\n\\n\r\nI'll admit, I didn't grasp all of the economic concepts involved but for me that was of secondary importance to the development of their relationship.  And besides, I'll definitely re-watch down the road and get plenty more changes to unravel things like poisoned credit and currency trading.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is excellent, very detailed and in some places truly beautiful.

            "content": "What makes this particular series so enjoyable is... well, to be honest, not many people can explain WHY they love 'Spice and Wolf', or the songs used in it. I found myself downloading MP3 versions of both Openings only to listen to them over and over again on repeat. I find it strange because I wouldn't usually like this kind of music.\r\nI will try my best to explain in words why I have come to fall in love with Spice and Wolf.\r\nThe story is of a merchant named Kraft (Craft?) Lawrence who unexpectedly comes across a wolf harvest deity named Holo.\r\n\"Okay, typical boy-meets-girl romcom\" -uh, no.\\n\\n\r\nI would first like to ask you think of the word \"Intimacy\". What does it mean to be intimate? Certainly, if a couple is ready to 'do' eachother in bed, they are considered 'intimate'. But what is TRUE intimacy? Can two people be close and share a bond so strong that nothing could pull them apart, even though they've never shared a kiss, or swore an oath? That is what most Anime series are lacking. They do not attempt to build and weave a bond so unseparable that even God himself can't tear them apart - instead, they get right to the sex-scenes or kissing scenes, etc etc. Spice and Wolf is clean, innocent, and very emotional.\\n\\n\r\nHolo - the main female protagonist of the series - is depicted as a Lone Wolf (literrally) at first, who rarely makes interaction with humans. After having met Lawrence - the main male protagonist - well, things changed. For better or for worse? Well, who knows?\\n\\n\r\nThe music really complements the series nicely. Again, I wouldn't usually like songs like these, but I just couldn't help myself. The atmosphere portrayed by the songs and the Anime itself is strong enough to make you shed tears. \"Romantic, vintage, classy, and sweet\" are the words that come to mind, but you cannot really explain it. It's just that inseparable bond... I guarantee you will cry at least once watching this!",

It is extremely well written, the two lead characters have great chemistry, the relationship is very believable, and the story avoids pretty much all of the cliches that I personally hate in love stories. There is no BS manufactured drama, no pointless lovetriangles, no dumb jealousy nonsense, no crazy over blown reactions. All of the problems the characters face and the issues that face their relationship feel legitimate. Spice and Wolf also has one of the greatest female leads I have ever seen in an anime, but I that is a very opinionated statement. The writing in some parts of season 2 does dip a bit, but not enough that it detracted from my overall experience in any significant way.\\n\r\nAlso, when the show is not dealing with the overarching love story, it is one of the most educational series I have ever seen. I seriously learned more about Medieval European Economics than in my AP European history class in high school. There are subplots about currency values, speculation, supply and demand, trade monopolies, and more.\\n\r\nFor those who prefer Dubs to Subs, the Dub is also pretty great and the chemistry between the lead characters is especially great.\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a good love story, than you can't get much better than Spice and Wolf.\\n",

            "content": "Okay Lion Tamers. Long time until now, 'cause I finally found one I like!\r\n'Ookami to Koushinryou', also known as 'Spice and Wolf'; is a new take on the traveling duo story. At least in a mechanical sense.\r\nUnder the hood of this story is a true romance, involving two completely different species of creatures. The story even has dialog, from time to time to make that case.\r\nAnd, as many will point out, there is a lot of dialog. In the anime's defense tho, I would much rather have a lot of good dialog, than one line of the wrong kind of dialog.\r\nSo let's take a lookat this thing, in a little more depth.\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\r\n1). The artwork is absolutely stunning. There are almost no anime that shows docked ships, in a rolling coastal sea, bobbing in the water. This show does this in almost 3d splendor. It is gorgeous and should not be missed. And it's not the only example of high-quality artwork.\\n\\n\r\nYou will find incredible motion art in many places, that defy description. For instance, how many anime show a heartfelt handshake, showing all the artwork, with individually articulated fingers? Very few. And this kind of thing is what makes the artwork stand out.\\n\\n\r\nMy only criticism, is the same as many other reviews I've made; does the Wolf character have to have bright Red Eyes? No living wolf in nature has red eyes, and it isn't necessary to make the case of this supernatural form of wolf. Sheesh.\\n\\n\r\nYahoo reports this: Best Answer:  A wolf's eyes may be brown, orange, yellow or pale green...\\n\\n\r\n2). Music is actually quite good. While I don't wish to own the soundtrack, the music was artful and appropriate to the shows' atmosphere. Three cheers for the authors not going for the J-Pop only meme.\\n\\n\r\n3). Dialog was mainly driven by the events within the context of the character activities. As well they should be, and almost never happens with any accuracy, in other anime.\\n\\n\r\n4). Romance! And lots of it. While I'm not a huge fan of romantic anime, in this particular case, Ookami to Koushinryou carries this out properly, with tenderness, comedy where appropriate, and subtleties rarely found in other anime.\\n\\n\r\nFor clarification, I become too often tired of comments involving the notion that if there is no sex in the story, then romance is not present. This is a naive notion, that requires adult maturity to understand with clarity. For those of you who don't understand this point; many of us, that have some age on us, often have romantic friendships with the opposite sex, that might continue for decades. Neither one of those people ever have the thought that sex is necessary to continue this romantic and fun relationship. That's not stupid; the thought that this cannot function is stupid.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is the proper and correct tack, in Spice and Wolf. They make this case, eminently clear. Besides, common sense would tell you that it is probably not possible for biological events following from a sexual relationship between a Human and a creature that exists only in fairly tales, lives almost forever, and rarely has anything to do socially, with Humans. Especially a female Wolf that has already eaten Humans for survival, and reveals this point in the dialog.\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\\n\r\nIf you like a great travelers anime, and want to see a Wolf in Human form, that actually does not act very Human; then this may be your anime. For those with the knowledge, and experience to understand it; Spice and Wolf might be your anime as well.\\n\\n\r\nI give it a clean and solid 9!",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf (Okami to Koshinryo) is quite a unique anime. It's based in an older European fantasy setting, but instead of magic, swords and dragons, the series has a focus on market trading and a female wolf god Horo (or Holo).\r\nCraft Lawrence is the main character of the series, a traveling peddler who buys stuff at one city, then takes it to the next city trying to increase his stock and earnings with every trade so he can eventually open a shop. While the interactions between Lawrence and the shop-keeps can be interesting, they tend to drone on a bit with unnecessary information. isuppose that since the trading is one of the main focuses of the story, they figure that the audience is genuinely interested in types of bartering loans, market fluctuations and church-influenced trade.\\n\\n\r\nHoro, the wolf harvest deity becomes Lawrence's traveling companion early on while a ritual is being performed in the village she was residing in. She takes on the form of a woman, but maintains the wolf tail and ears, I suppose to draw-in the furry demographic ;). Horo is quite far from the typical subservient and submissive otaku cliche of a date-sim girl, but a very proud, intelligent, obtuse, greedy, manipulative, and argumentative girl that occasionally shows her lonely side while being cute at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nI feel that the trading sessions do tend to be a bit long and carry a little too much information for the average viewer, while I would have rather seen a bit more interaction between the main characters. However overall, I found the series to be unique and enjoyable, with believable personalities and setting, and an unusual focus on trading rather than strictly fighting or romance. I would have certainly liked to see this series carry on another 13 episodes, but I'll take what I can get.",

            "content": "Well I have come again to judge the interesting and the boring, unfortunately this anime falls between the two. The story of Horo and Lawrence was a very interesting one, involving the trick of the trade of...well trading! Horo, a wolf god, accompanies Lawrence to escape her fate at the hands of some ungrateful farmers. Casually, Lawrence accepts and eventually changes her into his partner. Then along the way, they have their run ins with some financial and political figures, interested in their demise.\r\nNow this story from my review and the legitimate review sounds very interesting, but that's all. The show itself is about aslong as the review, which means its short and interesting. Light intellectual comedy inhabits the time between action and lets out a few laughs here and there, but you have to be pretty smart to catch everything. Then the little action here is pretty decent, but nothing special. As for Horo and Lawrence's relationship, there is some light romance, just not too much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7.5/10. Why? Because it had too much potential to end so simply like that.",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf:\r\nThe series is a great mix of adventure, comedy, fantasy, romance, and interestingly economics. While it isn\u2019t anything complex it does involve basics such as bartering, currency, trade, and a general gist of medieval economics that does take some thinking on the viewer\u2019s part to understand.\r\nAnimation: 8\r\nFor the most part when it came to focus on Lawrence or Horo it was top notch quality. It did well to display the medieval setting and set the atmosphere but there were just certain instances where the backgrounds felt off or little tidbits of the scenery, but I guess that\u2019s understandable considering the conservative budget thestudio was dealing with. Nothing that took away from the series as a whole, but generally could have been better at some parts.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8\\n\\n\r\nNothing else to say except that it\u2019s simply fantastic and very fitting. The Opening fits perfectly and is stunning as it captivates you with its vocal rhythm. All around the music was included to set the mood and played at exactly the right times that it blended in perfectly with the anime. The OST for Spice & Wolf is on par with the likes of Gundam, Evangelion, Baccano! (Done by the same studio), and Rurouni Kenshin which all had the greatest OSTs I\u2019ve ever heard.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuu\u2019s for this anime are ironically those who did Lelouche and Kallen from Code Geass, so I\u2019d definitely expected nothing short of excellence on their part and indeed they both delivered. They fit the role of their characters perfectly and portrayed them to the best of their respective designs. Everything felt right and matched accurately. Jun Fukuyama is easily my favorite male seiyuu ever.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe main focus is of course the male and female leads that are the prime aspecct of the anime. They both are wonderful characters and really stand out making the anime very compelling to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCraft Lawrence is a superb male lead who is mature, intelligent, wise, clever, kind, gentle, and overall well designed. He is goal orientated and through his travels continues to gain experience and build upon the knowledge of trading. I like his demeanor and attitude that fit well for his personality and his development is well constructed as he goes through many challenges and expenditures.\\n\\n\r\nHoro, the great wolf sage is herself a very unique character and one that sets herself apart from other female leads in other series. She also shares similar traits with Lawrence of being cunning, intelligent, and wise when it comes to dealing with aspects of trade, but she also has her respective feminine charm which in its own right makes for her greatest appeal and makes you really enjoy watching her antics. The amount of fanart for Horo is incredible and my folder of 300 pictures is still tiny compared to how much there is.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the two act around one another is very distinctive and sets itself apart from other couples in anime. What I found most enjoyable was that it isn't your typical emo angst high school love. Lawrence is very mature and he behaves accordingly and realistically when it comes to dealing with Horo, and she herself is playful around him most of the time. But what holds strong is their growing connection with one another as they help each other both in good and bad times. When Horo helps Lawrence in trade when they devise a scheme and he is impressed with her knowledge, or when Lawerence comforts Horo when she is feeling down and does his best to look out for her.\\n\\n\r\nThey both have two opposite characteristics that come together and conjoin to form a well rounded relationship. Lawrence who is a young merchant knows much about the world yet is still in the process of gaining more experience gets aid from Horo who has centuries worth of knowledge yet knows little about the world since she has been confined to one place for so long. They can both bounce off one another and in nearly every scene it makes for something fun and interesting to watch. They're ever growing romantic relationship is smooth and unforced, feeling natural as it develops over the course of their journey.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part the story isn\u2019t as important as is the character dialogue and interaction, which is the main focus of the series. Horo and Lawrence's banter was what kept the show so interesting and worth watching. I thoroughly enjoyed watching them speak with one another whether it was about trade, philosophies, or romantic tension. As noted earlier the economics isn\u2019t very complex but the different schemes that take place does require the viewer to pay close attention to detail and not for those who have short attention spans. I myself had to replay certain scenes to get a full grasp of the socio-economic aspects that were conspired. The anime of course was very faithful to the novels but with such a tight constraint of only 13 episodes a lot of the finer details felt \u2018crunched\u2019 and that took away from the anime.\\n\\n\r\nYet, generally the main focus came across well played and the viewer could understand what the dealings were and how they affected the characters. The feelings were well played whenever Lawrence struck a deal for his benefit or loss. You could feel his joy when it was something for his advantage and his devastation when he became bankrupt. While the plot was interesting the character interaction was indeed the highlight of the show. Lawerence and Horo bounced so well off one another and shared a wonderful dynamic that continued to build and improve itself as the series progressed from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite the series having little qualms for the most part, I'd say it was the fact that it was such a short anime that it felt rather incomplete. The plot was decent and the economics aspect was interesting but nothing that captivated you and kept engrossed. I myself as an economics major did find it enjoyable and quite unique but that wasn't what drew me to the series. Rather it was the relationship of Lawrence and Horo that was the single best facet of the anime. The way the two of them interacted while doing trades, getting away from trouble, or simply traveling on the wagon made every instance something to look forward to. The romantic relationship was great as they worked together and better understood each other over the course of the anime. It is best said that it isn't the destination of a journey that is important, but rather the journey itself which is the better part.",

I really enjoyed how the story winded itself with how powerful the church was back then and how if you strayed away from the church in any matter your butt will get chewed. This is a very good example of trade issues and knowledge of how the merchants trade and the demand of objects. It really is an interesting series!\r\nThe story is a descent one with a merchant who is mixed up with a so called god, holo who tries to get her to herhome town in the north and during the journey trades and profits from it. It is interesting to see how the market was used back in the \"good ol days\" :p\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fairly good. Nothing outstanding but visually attrative to my senses :)\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds were amazing, what I would think if I were in the mid-evil day or renaissance times, with harps, luts, violins, flutes and bards singing. I enjoyed the music and that in itself is a masterpiece to the show!\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters were funny and entertaining. The conflicts and problems that the main characters had were fun to watch and you got to see the two main characters grow a bond that hopefully you'll see in the next series grow into something special. It will be nice to see some romance and happiness turn out from it!\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment factor was great, very comical and exciting seeing how the supply and demand were used!\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a fun and entertaining, not to mentioned and educational series seeing how the supply and demand was used.

            "content": "Spice and Wolf. This title combined with the seemingly furry cover art might make this series look like pure generic weeaboo bait. Well, looks like the saying \u201cDon\u2019t judge a book by its cover\u201d is still alive and kickin\u2019. There aren\u2019t a lot of series like Spice and Wolf that can pull off fantasy, economics, and, let\u2019s face it, a goddamn furry wolf girl and be able to do it tastefully and realistically. Ah, and did I mention it somehow makes Medieval Economics 101 somehow entertaining?\r\nCenturies ago, the pagan wolf deity \u201cHolo\u201d traveled south from her homeland and became a goddess of the small farmingvillage of Pasloe. In return for their company, Holo would ensure that their crops would ripen well. As time passed, and farming technologies became more advanced, the villagers slowly backed away from their commitment. In her \u201chuman\u201d form she comes upon Lawrence, a traveling merchant. From this, another commitment is made. Holo will try to help with Lawrence\u2019s business endeavors, and in return he will return her to the north. Various antics ensure, involving currency devaluation schemes, price fluctuations, and shepherdess hiring\u2026 Just try to trust me when I say that the series does a good job on making these topics both entertaining and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nImagining an anime series built around economics, especially in a medieval atmosphere, does not seem too appealing. However, the smooth flow of the plot and the tension it creates makes this feat all the more impressive. I will admit that some of the intricacies of economics that the show introduces may go over some viewer\u2019s heads, but the show does its best to tell the general idea as well. There is some mortal danger thrown into the mix at some points, which does well with ramping up the tension, as well as giving Holo an excuse to use her wolf form. As a whole, the plot smoothly transitions between leisurely banter and some of the more tense parts.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s all about economics, however. A lot of it has to do with the chemistry and banter between Lawrence and Holo, and their different perspectives and lifestyles. Holo is a pagan goddess who lives life for pleasure and interaction, while Lawrence has a very practical mind, and always thinks like a merchant where everything can be related to economics or bartering. Because of these two perspectives, conversations are quite dynamic, even though an entire episode can pass without much else going on except the two leads talking with each other. Still, the sharp and witty byplay between Holo and Lawrence never seems to get old. Character development is done very well in this regard, and feels quite organic compared to most series where drama seems forced or changes unrealistically. If you\u2019re looking for pure fan service and wolf goddess yiffing, you\u2019re going to be sadly disappointed. Sure, we are talking about a girl with wolf ears and a tail, and there is nudity in some scenes, but it comes off as tasteful with it being more as an expression of character rather than purely pandering to the fans. Her playful and clever attitude, under toned with the loneliness of centuries of isolation, is a welcome reprieve from the generic tsundere heroines which are becoming all too popular these days.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, the animation is either hit or miss. The backgrounds look very organic and are very detailed, but there are some points where they seemed to have made shortcuts on drawing the characters. Thankfully the facial expressiveness with both Lawrence and Holo remains to be better than most throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, however, is done excellently. Many of the pieces are primarily fiddle or accordion, which creates a folksy vibe that works well with the series. If I have any gripe, it\u2019s the Engrish-laden ending song, but that\u2019s what skipping is for. As for the English voice actors, they do an impressive job as well. Holo\u2019s voice fits perfectly with her personality with the quick and subtle shifts in demeanor, and the general haughtiness in which she speaks doesn\u2019t get old.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Spice and Wolf\u2019s wonderful character dynamics and unique plots is a breath of fresh air which cannot be compared to any series so far, so long as you don\u2019t mistake it as a furry-pandering fanservice fest.\\n\\n\r\nFor more reviews on anime, music, and everything inbetween, feel free to visit http://everythingfornobody.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Note: This will be a review of both seasons, as I watched the two of them together.\r\nOverview:\r\n\"Spice and Wolf\" is a far cry from the anime I usually watch. All the other shows I've reviewed so far fall into the action category and while this does have some action in it, it focuses far more on the drama, adventure and romance categories. That's not to say I didn't like it, of course. In short, \"Spice and Wolf\" is a great historical fantasy series that made me feel very relaxed with its deeply touching love story.\r\nStory & World (8/10):\r\nThe story focuses on two characters- a wolfharvest deity named Holo from a distant land in the North and a travelling merchant called Kraft Lawrence, who's known almost exclusively by his surname. By a chance encounter, these two very different people meet when Lawrence finds Holo (taking the form of a teenage girl with wolf ears and a tail) sleeping in his wagon. One thing leads to another, and by the next morning, Lawrence has agreed to take Holo back to her home in the North, as she has been neglected as a God and feels she is no longer needed.\\n\\n\r\nSounds simple, right? Well, it is for the most part. but the journey is long and fraught with danger. In exchange for returning her to the North, Holo helps Lawrence increase the profits he makes with her wisdom (they don't call her 'Holo the Wise Wolf' for nothing) but they also sometimes get in trouble with the Church due to her true nature. Moreover, while Holo and Lawrence start off as mere companions on a journey, they grow to really care for one another, which gradually develops into something more as they both ease each other's long-standing loneliness.\\n\\n\r\nThe historical setting is very good, having plenty of European influences and it is implied that there are other supernatural animal-like beings besides Holo, although besides her, we only see one. We also get to learn quite a bit about how trading was back in the old days, Lawrence being a merchant and all. Unfortunately, the second season has a pretty open ending that may leave some viewers unsatisfied. Regardless, I really enjoyed the story and found the ending to be decent enough.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (8/10):\\n\r\nArtistically, \"Spice and Wolf\" doesn't look amazing but it doesn't look awful either. Instead, it simply looks good for its time. All of the characters and environments are well-drawn and the animations are smooth and fluid. Holo is particularly impressive, with both her human form and true form (which is best described as a giant wolf) being really well-designed. Ultimately, though, nothing really stands out.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Dialogue (9/10):\\n\r\nDefinitely the high point of the series. \"Spice and Wolf\"'s soundtrack is simply beautiful, fitting the setting of the series absolutely perfectly. The opening themes in particular for both seasons are brilliant. While watching the first season, I felt the first theme fitted the show perfectly, so I was shocked to discover that the second opening proved to be even BETTER than the first. The ending themes, unfortunately, are nowhere near as good. The voice acting is fantastic, with Brina Palencia and J. Michael Tatum giving it their all in my second favourite of each of their roles (my favourites being Yuno Gasai and Rintarou Okabe, respectively). The script isn't bad, either. Holo's dialogue in particular is really entertaining, as she's always poking a fun remark at Lawrence or flirting with him, with him occasionally giving a snide remark back.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.5/10):\\n\r\nThere's not much to say in this aspect. It's not that the characters are bad, it's that there aren't very many of them. Very few people seen actually have an impact on the plot, and the only ones that last any more than a single arc are Holo and Lawrence themselves. If I were to pick a favourite out of the supporting cast, it would have to be Nora Arendt, a shepherd who Holo and Lawrence meet during the second half of the first season. While I won't give too much away, I will say she helps Lawrence and Holo get out of a massive pinch.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, my favourite character overall has got to be Holo. Her flirty yet wise personality gives her a brilliant charm. Since she frequently switches between snobbish and friendly, it's hard not to call her a tsundere, but if you think that's a reason to dismiss her as generic, you're sorely mistaken because she's still one of the funniest, most unique anime characters around. Just look at her when she has some apples! As I said before, she's called 'Holo the Wise Wolf' for a reason, and her wisdom makes for some of the show's best dialogue, especially when she talks about her fear of being alone which, besides her wisdom, is her most defining personality trait. Having spent many centuries alone and watching so many people die, Holo has grown extremely lonely and, as time passes, having a companion serves as great comfort to her, which is the reason she refuses to leave Lawrence's side despite having several opportunities to do so. There are many different sides to her, and she is the selling point of the entire series for me.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Lawrence is a great character in his own right as well. As a normal human, Lawrence frequently has to deal with the hardships of being a merchant. He's also a bit of an anti-hero, as his desire to open his own shop frequently gets the better of him and he becomes very greedy, sometimes with serious consequences. Much like Holo, he knows how it feels to be alone, having travelled from place to place all on his own for years. In fact, before he met Holo, opening his shop was all he cared about, but he gradually begins to realise Holo is more important to him. Unfortunately, he is far too trusting and gets screwed over several times, which is bad for me as I've never been a fan of characters who have a bad habit of trusting the wrong people. All in all, he's a good character but not as good as Holo.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7.5/10): \\n\r\nI'd be lying if I said this show was for everyone. There's an awful lot of merchant talk which I found to be pretty boring on more than one occasion. While the relationship between Holo and Lawrence is both funny and heartwarming, some people may find the whole thing to be a little too normal. And this definitely isn't the most exciting anime out there, with the second season in particular putting a heavy focus on drama. If you're not into that, then I doubt you'll like this series very much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n\"Spice and Wolf\" is a brilliant, relaxing anime about the pain of being alone, the hardships of being only human and having to deal with failure and, most of all, companionship. There is certainly not something here for everyone, but if you want an anime with a brilliant female lead and a deeply touching love story, you should definitely check out \"Spice and Wolf\" \\n\\n\r\nScore:\\n\r\n8+8+9+7.5+7.5=40/50=8/10",

Spice and Wolf has filled that void.\r\nSpice and Wolf follows the adventures of a travelling tradesman named \"Lawrence Kraft\", and his companion Holo (\u307b\u308d) a divine beast that can take the form of a beautiful young maiden. \r\n**** Small spoiler\r\nThese two companions start travelling together through \"typical anime circumstances\", along their adventure Lawrence learns of the difficult past his companion Holo shoulders, the past love she had for a human man like Lawrence, and how she has lost her homeland to time.\r\n**** Small spoiler\r\nThestory is just great, while it isn't 100% original it's very well done. The art is beautiful, and is always used to compliment the mood that is trying to be set. The sounds never dissapoint you because much like the art they always help set the mood. I don't think I should ramble on too much about characters, but Lawrence starts out quite flat, but then later becomes a very round and static character; Holo starts out very round and static and becomes so much more than a character, but rather an entity that so many can make connections to.\\n\r\n(Yes, I know my comment on Lawrence is typical of anime characters.)\\n\\n\r\nTo say the least, I enjoyed this anime more than I ever expected to when I first started watching it. \\n\\n\r\nP.S \\n\\n\r\nThis is the only anime I have ever rated at 10/10\\n\\n",

Many anime have male MCs who happen to just find a female character but rarely is the backstory of the characters so interesting, and the setting is also refreshing for the genre.  Not too much development actually happens towards Holo's goals, but developments are made elsewhere and there side dealings are interesting and fun to watch. The developments made here lead into season 2 quite nicely as well.\r\nArt- I'm not too picky on my anime art styles or character designs, and neither disappointed here. The character's all look great but the real winner here arethe towns and buildings in this anime, all are well done, and the setting looks amazing overall.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Beautiful soundtrack, I hope you love stringed instruments though, there's a lot used here. The opening and closing songs are also quite nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Although everything else in this anime is quite well done the characters are the real selling point here. The chemistry between Lawrence and Holo is something you don't see too often in anime and really impressed me. Even the supporting character's of this anime are well done; all have their own ideals and motives, and even if they only appear in a single episode you can often understand them better than the MCs of some anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- I give this one a 9 overall it's a great series that had me hooked from the first episode. Whether it was the intelligence of the characters, their conversations or the setting this quality of anime doesn't come around too often, and it would be a loss to miss out on it.",

From the first episode the show highlights both the situation and the tone of the entire piece. Parts of Spice and Wolf are romantic and humorous, other parts are dramatic and thought provoking. Fortunately, the pace at which the story uses these elements is perfect, never giving the audience too much or too little. Even so, it isn't till the third or fourth episodes that we see what the show is really known for: The conspiracy and economics that are always at work. This is whatreally brings the story to life, the depth of the characters and their roles. Already we are given two very interesting characters as the leads, but no matter where the go the audience is pulled in by the realism of the settings. Character's have agenda's, goals, and different idea's of how to get there. Thus, how our \"hero's\" interplay with those characters creates a great interest. Overall, I highly recommend this show.",

A rarity about this anime, is that regardless of whether you watch it in English dub or sub, it is still very well done.

            "content": "When I started watching Spice and Wolf, all I had heard about the show is \"naked wolf girl\" and \"economics\". Sounds...fun? However, I knew there had be something special about the show, considering its high ranking on MAL and active fanbase. Luckily I was not disappointed.\r\nSTORY (7/10):\r\nYes, economics play a large part in the story in Spice and Wolf. It's not as bad as it sounds. As someone who dislikes Social Studies class, I was legitimately interested in some of the trades and bartering that Lawrence made throughout the series, and the economics manage to tie into a hooking part in the plot.\r\nART (8/10):\r\nSpice andWolf looks considerably above-average and shiny, even compared to anime airing in 2016.  The character designs for every character are great, but it seems like they put extra effort into Holo. There is careful detail placed into her ears and tail during certain scenes, as well as her wolf form looking spectacular. (The show doesn't hold back and try to make Holo's wolf form cutesy at all, and I'll just leave it at that. It's better if you see it for yourself in the show.)\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is average, but the ED surprised me by being a strange song that sounds like something you'd teach to an elementary school choir. It's quite catchy.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the Japanese track is still good, this is one of the best English dubs I've seen in a long time. Brina Palencia's role as Holo is flawless. The dialogue in both versions of the series is solid and memorable as well, and the main selling point of Spice and Wolf for many by just how well simple banter is written at times.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nBoth Holo and Lawrence are strong characters, and you'll likely grow attached to them after only a few episodes. I wish we would have learned more about some background characters, but this is only the first season, so a lot can happen in the future.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nI must admit, Spice and Wolf has a few dull moments, but they don't last anymore then a couple minutes. You barely have time to yawn before the show gets back into the great relationship development between Holo and Lawrence.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf well exceeded my expectations. Based off its plotline alone, I would have never expected it to be as well-crafted and entertaining as it was. No matter what your preferred genre of anime, I recommend giving this show a fair shot. You might be as pleasantly surprised as I was.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nCONTENT ADVISORY: Spice and Wolf features occasional scenes of partial nudity, some moderate violence, mild language, and lots of humorous drunkenness/casual drinking. The PG-13 rating fits, though it's very unlikely most people under 13 would be able to appreciate the charm of a dialogue-heavy series like this.",

            "content": "\"Ookami to Koushinryou\" is a terrific anime which immerses you in a medieval-fantasy realm and the life of a young peddler. It fits mostly in the adventure genre with a side of romance, but because the music and art go above and beyond, I would highly recommend this series to anyone!\r\nStory [7/10]: Similar to how some anime are driven by supernatural phenomena or sports, Spice and Wolf is driven by trade bargains. The fallout of these trades allow for fantastic adventure, but the bargains themselves (which take up a good chunk of screen-time) are a burden to the story.\r\nImagine a basketball anime where each passis explained and deeply analyzed. That's how the trade sequences often feel, exacerbated by the fact that the show avoids financial terms such as \"currency trading\". Staying with the basketball analogy, it's as if all lingo from \"dunk\" to \"foul shot\" had to be described. Still, all things considered, the story is captivating and a fun ride.\\n\\n\r\nPacing [6/10]: Given the short length of the season, it is disappointing that there are only two main story arcs - the pace felt like it expected 26 episodes instead of half that. Altogether too much time is spent \"bargaining\" and explaining their bargains, giving the plot and character development too little time to proceed. Still, the pacing is consistent and plods forward steadily.\\n\\n\r\nArt [9/10]: There are times when it's necessary to pause Spice and Wolf and just enjoy the artwork. Set in a medieval time, everything from clothing to animals to wood/stone buildings is incredibly detailed. Even though the two protagonists travel from city to city so nearly every scene has a different location, the animators withhold no effort.\\n\\n\r\nSound [10/10]: The soundtrack to Spice and Wolf is absolutely unique and stellar. It creates an atmosphere in a way found only in a few other series, making even the most mundane scenes lively. I sometimes found myself watching the series just for the music alone.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [7/10]: Most of the dialogue in Spice and Wolf is either regarding trade or the characters' current travails (i.e. trying to stay alive and financially sound). This leaves little room for character and relationship development, so what we get is mostly implicit. In the end, these hints added up to a vague idea about the characters' personalities and their depth. Considering that the series only had two main characters, I hoped for more.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [8/10]: Start Spice and Wolf for its gorgeous soundtrack and artwork, then stay for the adventure! Although not without its faults, the show is highly addicting and rewarding to watch. I would recommend not expecting too much from the romantic subplot though, as it is not explored very thoroughly. Finally, and this may be due to translation difficulties, the bargaining took tremendous effort to follow, so be ready to pay close attention.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: [8/10]",

            "content": "If ever I expected a show to air until it's conclusion it would be this one. This shows ability to keep an audience (me) captivated without having any real conflict is beyond impressive. I put off watching this show for a very long time because I expected it to be ecchi, fortunately it was only ecchi for the first few episodes. Lets get into the categories.\r\nStory: 4\r\nThe reason this gets such a low score is because there was no real story to speak off. This is not a flaw in the show however. The story follows Lawrence and Holo going to the North. Thats it.Basically nothing ever happens. A few times Lawrence gets into some major economic battles. Ill go over this in a different category though.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art style is extremely simple yet it manages to convey every single expression flawlessly, stays more or less consistent, and captures the mood of any given episode perfectly. The quality is astounding, although it gets outshined by newer shows like Fate.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nNothing memorable about the sound for me. It wasn't bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThis is where the show shines. Lawrence and Holo make a brilliant pair, and their witty verbal battles are what keeps you hooked to the show. This is dialogue done right. Other characters are also quite interesting but you mostly get to see Lawrence and his wolf.\\n\\n\r\nThis show focuses heavily on business and economics to propel it's story. Although it's dumbed down quite a bit it managed to lose me a few times. If you have any knowledge or interest in economics this show should interest you. If you don't, this show could kindle an interest in you. The economic battles that Lawrence finds himself in often involve psychological warfare and the appropriate allocation of resources for success. I can't stress enough how intriguing this aspect of the story was. Give the show a try, the first episode is a very good indicator of whether you'll like the show. The remainder of it is basically the same (Except with no more nudity).",

The OP and ED songs are quality as well, and the soundtrack is sprinkled with music fitting of the setting.\r\nThe dialogue was overall good too, I enjoyed the banter between the protagonists. It may just be me, though, but the dialogue felt a little confusing at parts. It was more plot-driven than I expected; I was expecting more slice-and-life. Not that plot is a bad thing,but I think it would have benefited more from the latter. Maybe the manga is more like that? The show seems a bit cobbled together at parts yet it does have intelligence at its core, so it gives me the sense that the manga is likely more well-'Craft'ed. :P\\n\\n\r\nIt's still a reasonably solid, fair anime. I'm semi-interested in reading the manga. I may have expected more out of Spice & Wolf but it's one of those shows I could see growing on me bit by bit over time. 6.7/10",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf is set in medieval times, with a slight bit of fantasy put into it. It is clear from the get go that this is not an action anime. There are very few scenes that feature fighting, and the fighting in itself is very 'realistic', in the sense that characters are not performing impossible 5 meter jumps, or dashing around at the speed of light.\r\nAs such, all of the episodes feature extensive dialogue, which can be either a good thing or a bad thing depending on what you like the most. Most of the time will be spent looking at the two maincharacters, Lawrence and Holo, and the interactions between one another. They both have very defined and distinct personalities, and their interaction with each other is by far the biggest selling point of the anime. So much that, whenever they are separated for some reason the show starts to drag around somewhat. Thankfully that doesn't happen very often during the 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is created along with the show. What I mean with this is that almost everything story wise, both starts and ends during the period shown in the show. There is very little back story, and even less actions expected to happen in a distant future. The story is how the main characters are living at that moment, with barely anything that happened before influencing it. It is also not very ambitious. It is the sort of events you could easily believe to have happened in the past, with the slight bit of fantasy lore I mentioned in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the art is very good, I don't feel it is good enough to push this anime beyond a 7. The OST has a few great tracks but mostly I found it to be fairly average. As I said, most of the enjoyment of the show comes from seeing the two main characters interact with each other, but the rest of the anime sort of dragged my overall impression of it down.",

            "content": "Spice and Wolf is a difficult anime to rate. Even before watching it i was unsure how i would feel about a dialogue heavy anime in a medieval setting. I really enjoyed this anime, most episodes captured my attention so well they were over before i knew it.\r\nThe plot primarily is about Kraft travelling around trying to make money through trade whilst dealing with the Pretty, high maintenance wolf girl Holo . It seems like a simple concept but it is done surprisingly well. There isnt really any major battles or arguments but the show does feel adventurous and clever. I loved the methods inwhich Kraft and Holo bartered and traded, it left me with an appreciation and better understanding for the art of trade.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to Characters there really are not many to discuss. Kraft the trading obsessed traveler,  Holo the wolf in a girls form and to some extent Nora the shepard girl are the only characters with any development. The interactions between Kraft and Holo are clever and funny and builds the foundation of a good Partnership. Spice and wolf does not immediately start with a romantic interest between the characters but naturally leads into one, which is really highlighted in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the highlights of this show is the art. Some of the background scenery are beautiful and overall the designs and color are great. The background music is well timed and helps promote the medieval setting.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime i would recommend watching if you want an adventurous sort of romantic anime without the need for much action. Spice and Wolf is a great anime if you can appreciate economics and business. The only shortcoming i have with spice and wolf is that it wont blow you away with an amazing story or characters, but it is definitely enjoyable.",

            "content": "This is a conglomerate review of both Seasons 1 and 2 of Spice and Wolf.\r\nRarely does popularity and fame accurately define and characterize the overall competency of a series or film. Fortunately Koushinryou is a prime example of this predominantly due to its sophisticated splendor and comprehensive brilliance. \r\nThis anime is very ambitious and exceptionally daring in regards to that the aspects as well as priorities of the story are virtually converse of the norm extant in the majority of mainstream anime. Shockingly this remarkable tactic doesn\u2019t simply somehow manage to pay off for Spice and Wolf, but even ameliorates the significance of the plotitself as well. \\n\\n\r\nThough this anime may at first outwardly and evidently present itself to be centralized around its impressive cast of characters to address the genuine emphasis of the plot, it\u2019s in fact quite the opposite. It\u2019s the subsidiary aspects such as the medieval setting of which the world takes place in that really, not to mention very effectively, convey the essential points of the story, albeit in an indirect manner.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s quite admirable and superlative how both Brains Base and Imagin managed to portray the ambiance of Koushinryou so extensively as well as accurately. Undertaking this task was indubitably the most challenging and exacting feat to accomplish for this series. Luckily they overcame this imperative obstacle, and thankfully as a direct result the series reaped a plethora crucial benefits that would lead it to attain eminence. To be genuinely fair though the historically precise environment isn\u2019t the only enrapturing aspect that is distinguished. \\n\\n\r\nDo not be heedlessly deluded or form imprudent assumptions from the fact that Spice and Wolf transpires in the midst of the middle ages, this is no Knight\u2019s tale. This is an anime that revolves around predominantly two specific features, business and profit, to be more precise the profession of merchant trade. \\n\\n\r\nAs such Koshinryou contains a rather tremendous amount of close-knit dialogue consistently through the divergent and gradually escalating plot developments. It should therefore go without saying that the viewer will require a constant adequate sense of attentiveness as well as remaining vigilant. \\n\\n\r\nBy all means of course Koushinryou isn\u2019t focused exclusively on just our protagonist\u2019s occupation, there is also laid-back, less thought provoking entertainment abound as well. So while this particular anime isn\u2019t precisely designed to be appealing to every viewer type, it certainly is alluring for an expansive variety.\\n\\n\r\nThemes: 9\\n\\n\r\nThough Spice and Wolf is set in a historically authentic setting that\u2019s voluminous and vibrant to say the least, fantasy elements are appropriately infused in a rather ingenious manner. It\u2019s ironic how the fantasy aspects are so minute and seemingly extraneous at first but gradually come to play such a key and pivotal role for the exquisite overall story. \\n\\n\r\nEven without fantasy being incorporated this series would still manage to deliver a very thrilling and wondrous experience, however would indubitably mislay its inventive and elegant components in the process. In addition this series would be deprived of the profound philosophical issues that are addressed nearing the conclusion as well. \\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s any particular aspect about Koushinryou that is distinguished, represents the epitome of perfection, and is unparalleled, then it would most certainly be the romance extant between our protagonists. Quite frankly the quality of it merits more praise and admiration than can be possibly given for its plethora of exceptional yet contemplative feats. \\n\\n\r\nThis particular style of romance is quite rare in regards to that it\u2019s very inclusive and effectively portrays the negative as well as the positive consequences of long-term bonding. Moreover it\u2019s perspicacious and quite inspirational with which it depicts relationships in general, whether romantic or not, by focusing on though provoking topics such as ethics and personal values that make individuals so unique.\\n\\n\r\nNow considering that our protagonist is indeed a peddler, a traveling merchant who wistfully has no permanent home to speak of that constantly travels to make a living in the trading business, it should therefore obviously come as surprise that adventure is such a prominent theme in Koushinryou. \\n\\n\r\nThe adventure is enthralling and riveting, and is essential for revealing the expansive world to the viewer. Although more importantly it\u2019s imperative for allowing the viewer to become associated with and deduce the diverse array of regencies that unjustly govern the land. In addition how they each control their respective economies and dictate policy concerning trade regulations, not to mention overall law as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nOne uncredited theme extant in Spice and Wolf that is predominant throughout is its rather miraculous and phenomenal sense of drama. The drama itself is fundamentally distinctive in regards to that it isn\u2019t directly caused by character to character interactions that incorporate sappy melodrama, it\u2019s far more sophisticated than that. \\n\\n\r\nThe originative yet calamitous and unexpected predicaments that frequently arise are due to business transactions the protagonist undertakes that fall through. In a world where trading limitations are austere and draconian, it should incontestably come as no surprise that merchants or even trade unions will utilize deception and hypocrisy to their advantage simply to make a profit. \\n\\n\r\nLastly there is once again another unrecognized theme that is extant in this series, comedy. The comedy is less frequent and prevalent than one might ostensibly anticipate, but is still cogent nonetheless. Overall the humorous moments are designed to alleviate and counteract the incessant stream of complex business developments that frequently transpire, and it executes this magnificently. \\n\\n\r\nMain Points/ Messages: 9\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf is genius and very astute when concerning the manner in which it addresses its main points, it very lucidly demonstrates just how dexterous this anime truly is. It is such a profound and philosophical question/topic that is suddenly presented to the viewer that doesn\u2019t necessarily have a straightforward and definite answer either. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a crucial question that defines our existence as well as who we are as individuals for the remaining duration of our natural lives, what are the fundamental things that we desire and aspire to achieve in life.\\n\\n\r\nAt first this may ostensibly seem to be a rather frivolous and na\u00efve query to even ponder over, practically extraneous for even being implemented in the first place. Since after all our protagonists are already resolute and have established life-long goals right, considering they seem to be pretty content being peddlers anyways, even though they don\u2019t have a home. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the conspicuous misunderstandings one might have concerning the protagonist, it\u2019s still impressive how they\u2019re an abundant amount of more obscure aspects of this topic that are harder to fathom wholly, though not quite enigmatic fortunately. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up in a straightforward manner, the issue and revelation that the viewer simultaneously realizes with our protagonist is that what is more important to you personally, or to be precise what is true value and worth? Are the inseparable bonds and relationships between people more significant and vital, or is your personal profit and overall dignity as a businessman? Does your career define you as an individual or the people you come to reside with and rely on? \\n\\n\r\nEven though Koushinryou doesn\u2019t exactly provide you with the protagonists answer that we\u2019re eagerly waiting to hear, it still manages to give this series a perceptive quality that is seldom extant in other anime. The conclusion is an open book in a sense, it leaves the decision to the individual viewer I suppose to discern for themselves what choice would have been made. \\n\\n\r\nIn addition there is another rather brief and concise message that is directly relayed through the dialogue itself near the ending. It\u2019s addressed in an intriguing manner, from both the perspective of a businessman, Lawrence, and from our heroine, who is more of an idealist in a sense. \\n\\n\r\nThe message from a sybaritic yet commonplace merchant\u2019s perspective, is that indulgence is a double sided coin, indulgence and greed can lead to ecstasy, but to a point, subsequent a certain point one will come to the inevitable revelation that material desire is excessively insatiable and absolutely can\u2019t be fulfilled to one\u2019s utter satisfaction. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize it bluntly greed is imperative to a degree but one must be wary since an excess is self-destructive. From our heroine\u2019s perspective Horo, it\u2019s that it is perfectly acceptable to have wishes someone wishes to achieve or obtain in their respective lives, despite the fact that they will most likely never be attained. Though it\u2019s still critical to note that if you don\u2019t wish whatsoever, then nothing you ever aspire to accomplish will ever come true either. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the messages presented through the story whether indirectly or directly are indubitably some of the most canny, prudent, and touching I have ever witnessed in an anime ever. A truly superb and marvelous execution of addressing the main points of the fundamental plot. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very immersive, moderately intricate, and compelling to the utter extreme to be honest. This is undoubtedly one of the most well balanced and well paced anime in existence, it was neither excessively complex, nor was it simple. The character and plot development wasn\u2019t excessively sluggish nor was it rapid, it was nearly impeccable. Each major respective story arc was astonishingly rejuvenating and unique, and very exhilarating to explore from the viewer\u2019s as well as the characters perspective. \\n\\n\r\nYou practically feel as though you\u2019re somehow of part of the world itself at certain times, that\u2019s quite frankly just how gratifying of an experience the story is. The only apparent drawback whatsoever in regards to the plot is that the conclusion may be unconvincing or insufficient for some. Of course that is to be expected since this does end with an abrupt cliffhanger in a sense. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that the predominant portion of the characters incorporated within Koushinryou were mature adults was a very clever and crafty decision. Especially since by doing so, you cogently show that despite the fact that we as humans eventually conform and grow accustomed to our imperfect and perplexing surroundings. We still will never wholly comprehend or perceive our deficient rudimentary selves, no matter how much experience and enlightenment we have acquired over the years. \\n\\n\r\nA truly spectacular job regarding the execution and overall quality of the characters themselves. In addition the voice acting was impeccable and very believable for every respective character in both seasons 1 and 2.\\n\\n\r\nSetting: 10\\n\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve proudly mentioned previously in my review, the environment itself is very expansive and refreshingly diverse in style as well as organization. You can tell that both respective animation studios put all their coordinated effort into creating a setting that is extremely fascinating and engrossing, yet whilst remaining as realistic as possible simultaneously. Kudos to the designers for their outstanding diligence and sincere dedication, what an accomplishment indeed. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art designs in general are exquisite and sublime, though there are inconsistencies between the two seasons in overall style that are too conspicuous to ignore, albeit a minute amount. Of course this is undoubtedly a direct result of studio changes between the seasons, and the reasoning for this is enigmatic to me, but fortunately it doesn\u2019t necessarily affect the general quality of the series significantly. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe overall sound quality, whether it\u2019s character voices or background effects were all appropriately balanced. Though there is significantly less BGM extant in Spice and Wolf than what one would expect. Fortunately this doesn\u2019t hinder the series in any particular manner. On the contrary it\u2019s quite admirable how this series doesn\u2019t become monotonous or insipid as a result of the lack of music at times. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the opening and ending songs for both seasons, they are the perfect tone in regards to the overall ambiance of Koushinryou. They are very calming and relaxing, no upbeat or fast-paced melodies here that detract from the established tonality. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nSpice and Wolf is one of the most distinctive anime I\u2019ve ever seen concerning it\u2019s rejuvenating and unique take on romance and bonding. The main points and messages addressed are perspicacious and very sophisticated, truly excellent. Practically every other aspect or quality within this outstanding show is comprehensive and elaborate without being complicated. \\n\\n\r\nThis is certainly the archetype of a true masterpiece that doesn\u2019t merely attain its well deserved fame by just being excessively amusing to the masses. If you\u2019re searching for a genuinely superb anime that is profoundly sophisticated, with majestic romance than I would definitely highly recommend watching Ookami to Koushinryou, it\u2019s worthwhile. \\n\\n\r\nWould appreciate any feedback, will eagerly and readily discuss any opinions or comments regarding my reviews as to better future reviews, these reviews are designed to assist the viewer, not to just state my impressions of it just for fun, thanks!\\n",

            "content": "spice and wolf, the anime i've been dying to watch for some time but i didn't know if i was going to like it. the first thing that drew me in was the thought of a wolf but upon starting to watch it, it became much more than that. \r\nwell to start off, the anime has a clean story line in the beginning that i found i could understand without too much trouble. as the anime progressed a few episodes, i found that dialogue was a huge part in the understanding department. i know i'm not the first to say this but, if you don'tlisten to what people are saying, you are going to be lost later on. it isn't really hard to understand per se if you are paying attention there is just a lot of information. listening to it multiple times may be needed to get the full picture but not if you are good at keeping up with speech. no use in explaining what the story is about since that would be spoiling and you have MAL to tell you that so lets not waste time there. the art here was beautiful in my point of view. all the characters were very well designed as was the setting in which we are in. being set in medieval times made it all more beautiful to me. the clothing of the characters, cities, and scenic points are all done well to show off the beauty of the time era the anime is set in. sound, again i watched the english dubbed version and i really enjoyed all the voice acting. holo i thought was done well with her accent, for some reason i found it pretty. music and sound effects were good too, nothing too flashy but it flowed pretty well between scenes and was put in at good points to keep the watcher entertained. characters, haha well i do love them. some may call holo full of herself, which yes i admit she does seem that way sometimes, but more or less she uses her knowledge to help both herself and ones whom ally with her. it also shows off a personality all of her own that i enjoy and hints toward the fact that maybe traveling alone with a man isn't such a bad thing after all. i really enjoyed the anime for its twist of real medieval times life and the fantasy. i was in love with how the setting/time era played into everything and still managing to have fantasy. as i've heard before, this is the only anime that makes economics fun ^.^ you would be wise to check this anime out in my opinion, it is a winner for me.",

Sounds stupid.Hey look, its a furry, let's watch.\r\nStory-\r\nOne of the most unique stories i have ever seen in an anime. It was very surprising how much you can understand about the characters by their actions. I know actions speak louder than words, and this series proves it, especially since no one ever talks about their feelings, it's all done through actions. (almost)\r\nArt-\r\nGood art, at least its proportional. No 'huge boobs' characters, or things that just look stupid.\r\nSound-\r\nOP and ED weren't very relevant, but i at least sorta liked the ED. Seven appleson a witches tree....\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\r\nIt's captain dense! With the power to understand nothing, and at the same time everything! Did anyone else notice that despite being a 'great' merchant, he seems to get swindled more than he makes profits?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\r\nVery enjoyable, if not just for the change of pace. It's not an action, not overly cheesy romance, and not ecchi fanservice. refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\r\nYes.",

Lawrence makes an agreement with Holo that he will go with her back to her home in the north. Soon afterwards a series of funny,dramatic and sad events occur over the 13 episodes that make up season 1.\r\nStory\r\nThe story although good is the weakest aspect of the series. The main story of merchant meeting wolf in human form I love and I think it's enchanting and makes for some great moments. However this is letdown by the boring corporate espionage andmacro economics that are heavily present throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt \\n\\n\r\nThe Art is great and I have no problems with it. I have not noticed any instances of bad animation that has detracted from my enjoyment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in Spice And Wolf is great. The voice actors really make the characters come to life I cant imagine any one else other than Ami that can play Holo's voice. I pray to god that the english voice actor for Holo isn't horrible.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe best aspect of the series Holo is one of my favorite female characters ever. A apple addiction and unpredictable attitude make Holo the best thing about the series. Lawrence is also a likable character and can be quite funny when he teases Holo.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude I love the series and I highly recommend you add it to your &quot;plan to watch&quot; list",

            "content": "I'm a fan of anime with action, but Spice and Wolf was honestly one of the best shows I've seen.\r\nMost medieval fantasy stories usually focus on fighting and magic, but Spice and Wolf focuses on trading and economics. It's a new original idea and nice transition to the knights, mages, and dragons we're all used to associating with the genre. Although the idea of a show with just talking and economics in a fantasy world may seem lame and slow, I never found myself feeling bored during the series. Spice and Wolf makes this tiresome and boring topic quite interesting. There actually is a littlebit of action in the series, but it's very short and not too frequent.\\n\\n\r\nThe focus on Lawrence and Holo throughout the series lets their characters develop well. It's not a very complex plot so it's centered a lot on them and their relationship. I found Holo's character very likable and she is no doubt one of my top favorite female characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe beautiful vibrant scenery in the show was just spectacular. There was so much detail in the background and watching it in perfect HD made it look even more wonderful. All of the character designs and places really fit the setting to me. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary in this era. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for the show was very simple, but it went along with the moods of the scenes perfectly. I must say I loved the openings for the two seasons. They seemed peaceful and fit the show very well. The ending song to the first season, although it was in Engrish, was pretty cute and I liked it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I absolutely loved this show and underestimated it before I watched it. I don't expect everyone to love it, but if you think you might like it or want to try something new I'd definitely recommend this show.\\n\\n",

Lawrence and Holo's conversations are pretty nice to.\r\nSo story's a 9.\r\nThe art looked nice to me. Nothing looked weird or bad.

The good thing was that from season one to season two the majority of the staff and voice actors remained the same including director Takeo Takahashi whom at this point had only done a couple very below par shows to his name (Chou Henshin Cosprayers). The more important question remained. How can a show about economics be interesting andfun without it becoming a total and complete bore?\\n\\n\r\nOur setting takes place in a world based on trade with commodities being made, sold, and transported via horse and wagon. The story begins focusing on a young merchant or tradesman by the name of Kraft Lawrence (name means power in German). In fact, think of the show taking place in a peaceful medieval Germany. Legends come from middle European folklore, towns are built in mostly German architecture, and even most of the written language in the show is in mediaeval German (second season diverts to mostly nonsense at one point). One fateful day as Kraft is visiting a small farm town that has a large wheat harvest, a young wolf deity, the one from the town\u2019s legends, takes the form of a beautiful young woman. She goes by Holo the Wise Wolf and asks Lawrence to accompany him on his travels with the purpose in finding Holo\u2019s home located far in the north.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is an extremely fresh and uncommon subject. After a nice setup, Lawrence and Holo begin a simple journey and leads to the characters committing non-stop banter and foreplay. A show that creates exposition in a form full of sass and sarcasm. Both characters deal with their emotional differences, their goals in life and how this encounter interferes, and the greatest conflict of all being money.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, viewers did not get a college level crash course in German medieval trading and economics, but instead focuses on the banter between a clumsy yet ambitious Lawrence and a cunning sass-filled Holo. There are arcs which inevitably turn into a financial nightmare each time. This is where the two main characters get to show off main character traits of both good and bad. Often enough, Lawrence will begin with a massive cocky boast about his intentions, while Holo whines like a small child only to be slyly holding an ace-of-spades in her back pocket. Each arc in both seasons showcase a bit of morality and a little character development mostly of the slow relationship build between Holo and Lawrence rather than individually.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does only cover four volumes of the source material [S1 covers vol. 1,2; S2 covers vol. 3,5]. That is not much across 25 episodes in total. Sure, the anime takes all the necessary time to cover each arc extremely well. However, the downside is the show goes almost nowhere in terms of reaching their goal. Basically zero character development occurs throughout the seasons with whatever happens in the plot, the characters do not change other than the people met along the way. At the end of the show, nothing significant has occurred and plot convenience occurs almost second nature in Spice and Wolf. This gets the viewer to assume it will all work out in the end without a need to truly worry.  Luckily though, there is still something reminding the viewer that maybe this arc could be the one to change it all, and that must count for something.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does end incredibly abruptly just when finally some development might happen. Animation and music are average for the time, but done well enough to not warrant complaints. Is the show full of useless fluff and a show that can put a smile on a face? Sure. Is it the greatest story ever told? Not even close. Spice and Wolf is a lovely show that somehow makes economic and sarcasm worth watching.",

            "content": "This is very hard for me to review without being biased, because well.. I freaking love economics!\r\nIll jump right into it and keep it short:\r\nStory- 8/10\r\nUsing the descriptions allowed, this is a 'very good' story for me. It shines well above average. \r\nAside from what the description already tells you, traveling merchant meets wolf god furry fetish girl. Flirts with her a lot and takes her along with him on his business ventures with the ultimate promise of returning her to her snow clad mountain homeland.\r\nThis is a very action driven story, which I hate. Its very well structured, linear and convenient. So far thisstory would have earned a 6 in my opinion, because while it is very action driven and the romance is a bit clich\u00e9 and well.. weird, what it has going for it is that its very well executed. Our characters interactions are adorable and the plot progression and pacing are pretty well thought out in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the plot redeems itself is in the premise, which normally isn't a decisive factor, but as I said I freaking LOVE economics, so here comes the bias. The setting for this story is Europe in the middle ages! Brilliant!\\n\\n\r\nIn the history of economics this was a critical time. Mediums of exchange (coins) were commonplace, but barter economics was still going strong. Wars and conflicts gave rise to new forms of currency manipulation, lack of law and order meant that everyone in the business world was literally out to scam and defraud anyone they could at a moments notice. And boy did they have some clever schemes.. The power of the church was growing and ultimately surpassed the power of almost every government in the world, most of whom were bankrupted by their own ambition. Guilds and trading companies and barons and towns allied each other one day and betrayed the same the next as suited their interest. Don't even get me started on the rampant corruption! Literally getting away with murder was a joke, pocket change for any wealthy trader. It was a very dangerous time to be a merchant, and failure meant starvation or worse!\\n\\n\r\nIts a long standing fact that politics and economics are inseparable and the era this story takes place, was one with whacky economics and even wackier politics. As such any story taking place in this period has the potential to reach game of thrones proportions. In short it had me on the edge of my seat at every second. Going into it without any economics or history knowledge may have been tough. But with some quick research one quickly discovers that the reality of the situation left our MC's life in danger at literally any conceivable second. Every meeting could have potentially concluded with him dead in a back alley somewhere. His job was roughly the equivalent of being a professional Mexican drug smuggler in our present day. For this reason it gets a solid 8.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 4/10\\n\\n\r\nit was completely mediocre with poor animation. Next. Holos animation and character design is literally the only saving grace for this. Love the way they utilize her tail to contribute to her body language and portray her mood.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nI mean I loved the OP and ED, but I can't really recall this show having a score? Voice acting was good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAverage.. really entertaining to watch but didn't get any development. No supporting characters, side characters were generic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nAll about the story here.. Economics and this setting are perfect!\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was definitely a 'good' anime. It wasn't average, because in my opinion to get average you have to factor in all the TERRIBLE school, moe, crap shows there are out there with all the good ones. Mediocrity is subjective, and while I love anime, and believe there's a lot of good to be found, there's also a whole lot of garbage you have to sift through to find it. It wasn't just 'above average' because it wasn't just a really good moe school crap show. It was definitely in the category of being good and genuinely fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nPeople on this site are too quick to rate shows with like 3's and 4's. Doing that to this show is a joke, you're basically saying its worse then watching some absurd magic girl show with the same lack of character development, animation etc that this show had. No. this show is worth watching, just maybe on a rainy day or something.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Sadly i have yet to watch the second season, because it isn't dubbed, and i started this show dubbed so  I wish to finish it that! (Toatally have this show playing in the background.\r\nSO now my broken down review\r\nSTORY~So it is about Craft Lawerence (haha spice) and Holo (wolf) Craft is taking Holo back to her home town and they end up getting wrapped up in a bunch of shanangans, which i L-O-V-E. Wealso meet a bunch of people, some important and some not, but all equally (fun,  interesting and/or exciting)\\n\\n\r\nART~ So now!I love the art in this, i have seen better, but i did enoy the art of this one alot...im not sure why, but i think it is really pretty.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER~ So Holo is my favorite! :D\\n\r\nI love how high and mighty she think she is, i realize she is a god or whatever, but she is so funny the way she acts, and her stories. I LOVE IT! also when she shows up craft with her awesome knowledge :D \\n\\n\r\nI like craft as well, but he seems a littl... erm boring i suppose? I love his sarcasim though, and when he teases Holo, it definatly adds alot to their relationship in my opinion, makes them closer. Because they both understand eachotherinan odd way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment~ Let's just say it is a very enjoyable anime. Im watching it for the second time, and i am enjoying it as much as i did the first time. I think it is the comedey in the show that makes it so good. There are parts though where iwas like *Drool*because they go way way way into the whole money thing and im like >.< but yea other then the slightly in detail parts, it is epic! and one i suggest to everyone whois into this genre :D\\n\\n\r\nAnd yea, done for now :D\\n\r\nHahahaha\\n\r\nBut yea this anime is fun and serious and i LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! So give it a go and enjoy\\n\\n\r\nXOX\\n\r\nHailey",

The story isn't really too interesting, and as a matter of fact there really isn't any story, the show is about they're journey to the wolf's hometown.\r\nThe art was alright, nothing to complain about nor praise about, but the sound received a 9 because of Holo's voice actor. Her voice actor is simply amazing and one of my favorites, she fits Holo just perfectly.\r\nThe characters were likable and they shared an interesting relationship.\r\nOverall this anime wasn't bad, and I can see manypeople have really enjoyed it. To me, Spice and Wolf was nothing more than an Economics class, and I feel it really did focus on money which is why I didn't enjoy it too much, but I am considering watching the second season. Pretty much anyone who's looking to watch an anime to waste time should try this.",

I found this a refreshing change from shows such as Bleach and Dragon Ball Z. The relationship between Lawrence and Horo is another important aspect that i found enjoyable, The cleaver use of Characters in an Aquared relationship in combination with a smooth art style creates an enjoyable viewing experience. Comedy also being used to develope character personalities, and shape the story. Overall isuggest watching this anime and experiencing  its unique qualities.",

            "content": "If you go to my profile you can see my top five favorite anime's, however, MAL  only lets me put down five. If I could pick two more shows to put on that list, they would be Fighting Spirit and Bleach. Now, Fighting Spirit is a 50 episode boxing anime. Which means there is a lot of fighting and action. And Bleach of course, is over 200 episodes with lots of characters and lots of battles. What I'm getting at is, its nice to see all those boxing punches and sword fights, but every once in awhile its nice to just sit back andenjoy a relaxing anime. \\n\\n\r\n\"Spice and Wolf\" does that for me, I remember watching it and feeling at peace. The characters, the world that brings us back to middle earth  and of course the AMAZING music. A man's journey is immedietly put to a halt, when finds a girl in the back of his cart, he thinks she's normal, but then he notices her tail... There are a lot of Slice of Life anime's that put you in that moment, and \"Spice and Wolf\" is one of the greats.",

However, what makes this different from other similar series is the relationship and the bond these two develop and share\r\nArt 7/10\r\nThe character's are well drawn, lovable and memorable (especially Horo). However, the drawback is the animation. The animation is mediocre.\r\nSound 8/10\r\nVoice acting was good, sound track was good, etc.\r\nCharacter 10/10\r\nI'd rate it 11 If I could. Horo is one of the best character's I've ever seen. You can't help but fall in love with her character! Her personality makes her a very realistic character. She's beautiful, cunning, smart, wise, sensitive but atthe same time fun, wild, playful and bossy. Her character is what made this show SUPERB. I totally envy Laurence! What a lucky guy!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nThere is a lot of emphasis and talk on economics and merchant-talk. It was something that confused the heck out of me, really. Aside from that, it was extremely enjoyable. The 2 main characters get along so well that I couldn't help but feel extremely envious. I wished I could be in Laurence's position! Ha..ha.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nGreat romantic + adventurous anime. I'd highly recommend it to anyone interested in these genres.\\n",
