            "content": "(2017 EDIT: Anime has JoJo references.)\r\nOreshura is just another harem rom com. It has nothing special about it and it doesn't stand out much at all. Yet it's really likable and you can't find many reasons to hate it. The reason is probably because as plain as it is, it does what it's supposed to do pretty well. \r\nThe story was decent (7). It wasn't special but it wasn't boring either. In fact, it didn't have much of a story. It's pretty much about a childhood friend trying to get the protagonist back to her from his kind-of-evil girlfriend, while more harem members join thecrew along the way. The different thing about this is the super lighthearted tone. To me this is what basically sets the anime apart from the others of the same genre. Oh, but it could also be because the protagonist ACTUALLY chooses someone in the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe art suited the lighthearted tone really well (8). The light colors gave off a watercolor like feel to it and it went well with the character design which together made it really cute, or rather, attractive. There should be more anime with this type of art, and I think it would go well with a lot of romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound/music suited the art and story perfectly (8). Of course it wasn't brilliant or outstanding, but it was fun and very well done -lol- , and the opening and ending were really cute, or rather, attractive. The BGM suited the comedic moments really well too.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters got me pleasantly surprised (8). For a generic harem, you can't expect too much out of the characters. You would expect (or I expected) the main character to be an ordinary, plain and boring person who can't make any decisions by himself, has the school idol at his feet every day but still refuses to notice her, who's parents are either dead or somewhere abroad, a non-blood related sister who would happen to have a crush on him, a perverted,wacko best friend who makes the MC look mature and reliable, when he himself has a porn mag stashed somewhere, etc. I could go on and on but that isn't the point I was trying to make, which is that the main character is actually likable. The essence of a harem anime are the harem members, not the leader himself. If the leader was more interesting than the members he would seem like a member himself. This MC is neither almost non-existent nor is he super fancy. He's just a nice guy who isn't overly anything and isn't annoying in the slightest. There is no imouto. There is no wacko friend, but instead a super sweet trap/friend. Yes, his doesn't live with his parents, but there's a story as to why things are like that. And his chuunibyo makes him pretty hilarious too. Most of the other characters are based on regular harem archetypes, but what makes them different is how funny, embarrassing and nice they all seem to be to each other. No two characters are alike, which is another plus point in harems.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment is over 9000 for me (even though I'm limited to putting a 10). This was a short and entertaining anime with the least offense I've seen an anime of its genre pull off. I'd recommend it to anyone who's just finished watching Corpse Party or something.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is one of the neatest of its type and is a fun show for anyone who doesn't hate Harem with their life (9). It's just a quick, fun way to spend some time.\\n\\n\r\n(My first proper review)\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Ore Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru\" Quite a long and complicated name. As the name states it, yes, it's a warzone between a childhood friend and the girlfriend with the addition of another two comic relief character.\r\nStory, 6/10:\r\nFor the story, well, people may thought, 'Hey, this must be another simple harem show again. whatever, i'll just watch it for fun'. Yeah, at first, i was like that, then, after a certain episode, the story was getting even more exciting. And to think that each and every one of the girls were given fair chances in getting the guy. \r\nOne thing that i really likeabout this show is that, it didn't feel rush. Everything went smoothly with the flow. Although there were moments where you would be like, ' whuh?' but it was still good.\\n\r\nI gave it a 6/10 score because the story didn't reached the climax where it should have been. And a few other scenes that should be so powerful, but ended up with a 'meh'\\n\\n\r\nArt, 8/10:\\n\r\nOne good thing about this anime is the art style. Some people might be disturbed by the light coloured theme, but for me, i loved it! It was so refreshing and so cheerful. God, the opening was so full of colours, i was caught by the colours myself. \\n\r\nThe character design was okay i guess. Although there were some scenes where the character's face was a bit weird. \\n\\n\r\nSound, 7/10:\\n\r\nI would say that the Sound in the anime played a not-so-much part in most of the massive scenes, where it should be. So yeah, maybe that's one of the reason why i feel the climax didn't reach the peak where i think it should have been.\\n\r\nThe OP and ED played a major role in setting up the cheerful atmosphere. I love the OP. Hahaha.\\n\r\nFor the second last episode, the ED played a major role  in setting the mood for the last episode. I can't tell you what it's about, but it was aweesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, 8/10:\\n\r\nSo in this harem, we have the genki girl, Harusaki Chiwa, the tsundere, Fuyuumi Ai, the chuunibyou, Akishino Himeka and the beauty, Natsukawa Masuzu. \\n\r\nUsually, in a harem anime, the main guy would be a total clueless dumbass that didn't even notice a girl likes him even after that girl confessed to him. But Eita, is not like that. he may be clueless at times, not because he is dumb, it's because of the family affairs which made him not to trust love. \\n\r\nAnd yes, i would believe that kind of reasoning, family problems could turn a person into anything.\\n\r\nThen, there's Chiwa, the childhood friend, fell in love with him after a certain incident(I won't spoil it). Also, has a bulletproof reason to love him.\\n\r\nMasuzu in the other hand, doesn't have any reason to love Eita, but she develops feelings for him later on. and i must say, watching Masuzu grew from the beginning to the end is really fun and sweet at times. although she can be a jerk.\\n\r\nHimeke and Ai, were practically the comic relief love interest. But even so, their reasoning to fell in love with Eita were both solid rock. Yes, even for a side character, i was rooting for Ai at some point.\\n\r\nA bunch of 'the usual' harem character but with interesting backgrounds and solid reason to why they like the same guy. Trust me, you won't get bored with any one of these characters, ever.\\n\r\nIf only, every harem makes sense like this one...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 8/10:\\n\r\nWhen the episode is getting dull, or the start of a new mission, behold! The Burning Fighting Fighter Notebook of Darkness!\\n\r\nHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!\\n\r\nYES, It was so embarrassing, i can't stop laughing. \\n\r\nAnyway, besides that, watching every singe one of the characters(including the aunt) developed at a same rate was really enjoying. every single one of them had a fair chance, even Kaoru. Yes, Kaoru. If only Kaoru was in the harem circle....\\n\\n\r\nOverall. 7/10:\\n\r\nLike it's title, 'My girlfriend and childhood friend fight too much'. i agreed on that 100% percent. Because, it was all about a childhood friend and his gilrfriend. Ai and Himeka were just there. One of my favourite thing about the anime was watching Masuzu and Chiwa fought.\\n\r\n*cough* *cough* the last scene in the final episode, yup. i love that scene. eventhough there were no sparks between them, i swear i saw them inside my head.\\n\r\nit was so intense that it was so good.\\n\r\nCredits to the huge character developments in Masuzu. And yes, now i'm stuck between both of them.\\n\r\nIf the harem is bad, you'll like every characters in the harem circle, if the harem is okay, you would like only one of them but if the harem is good, you would stuck in choosing which one is the best.\\n\r\nYes, even now, i didn't see any winners yet. Not common for an anime but it's OreShura, where everything were for a reason. \\n\\n\r\nP/s:\\n\r\nI am rooting for second season!! No notebook, less comic relief, more love pentagon. Instead of being 80% comedy 20% romance, my guess, it would be 25% comedy, 25% serious and 50% romance for the next season. I wanna know more about Masuzu's family.\\n\\n\r\nIf you really like something refreshing to watch, watch OreShura. But if you think too much and more towards serious stuffs, don't watch it.",

            "content": "Alright, here's the deal. \r\nWell, there's no deal; not for a certain lucky or rather unlucky guy named Eita Kido anyways. The thing is, he gets blackmailed in the most embarrassing way possible. Now he's nothing more than a little boy toy to a certain admired beauty at school. But hey, at least he's getting a hot girl with a manipulative personality yet someone \u201ccares\u201d about him in some way right? That's not what it seems to be...\r\nWait, this is a bit too fast. Let's start from the beginning.\r\nOre no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru (God damn that is a long name, so Iwill call it 'Oreshura' instead), is an anime series that debuted in 2013 based on the LN written by Yuji Yuji. The Japanese title literally translates to:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cMy Girlfriend and Childhood Friend Fight Too Much\u201d\\n\\n\r\nYA THINK?\\n\\n\r\nWell, the series does display that theme quite a bit. For starters, we got this kid named Eita Kidou who is in his puberty years in high school. He's a normal high school student with a healthy body. At that age, most boys would think about girls, right? No, in his case, the only thing is in mind is to study, study, and study. In fact, he hopes to become a doctor. (for a friend's sake) Well hell, if anyone tries to make that into a goal, we should all envision on the journey to get there. It's not an easy task being a doctor and saving lives, not to mention the amount of education you need to obtain the occupation. This also came from some bad memories from his past related to his parents. (poor kid) And beyond that, he has decided to eradicate the thought of \u201clove\u201d from his thoughts. In other words, the only focus on his mind is to achieve his goal, with absolution regardless of the costs. Oh but life just isn't so easy for this kid because there's one BIG problem:\\n\\n\r\nMasuzu Natsukawa \\n\\n\r\nShe's a mysterious transfer student where after nine long years came to his school all the way from Sweden. She has silver hair and in anime logic, we all know that's an attractive trait. In real life though, that's probably bizarre. But at any rate, this girl quickly becomes the talk of the school where boys instantly becomes attracted to her. On the other hand, Eita is just being Eita there with no second thoughts related to her. That is of course till one faithful day. After a certain incident, it seems that Eita becomes blackmailed by a certain notebook (Death Note reference anyone?) and now is literally forced to play the role of a \u201cboyfriend\u201d for Masuzu. It's basically an offer he can't refuse!\\n\\n\r\nOf course, in today's anime industry, the concept of the 'fake boyfriend/girlfriend' theme is not new. It's literally a palm in the face at occasions where we watch a fake couple doing fake things that are expressed as fake romance. It's overused all over the world but hey, it's still here. The fact that Eita and Masuzu are a \u201ccouple\u201d means that they are the talk of the school and among other things, an obstacle for both Eita and his childhood friend Chiwa Harusaki. That's because Eita promised to become a doctor in order to help her with the injury that she endured during her times as a kendo specialist.\\n\\n\r\nNow regarding Chiwa, this girl gave the word 'annoying' a whole new meaning. With a lack of any sex appeal, an annoying mouth, and obliviousness to a lot of things, she plays the mascot of the show. In fact, she is even nicknamed as Chiwawa as a pun for chihuahua. This is because her petite figure and hairstyle resembles those of a puppy. Well, let's not forget about her mouth of course because a puppy barks when annoyed and Chiwawa here is no different. Sorry Chiwawa fans.\\n\\n\r\nShe brings on some early drama in the series after finding out about the whole fake 'boyfriend/girlfriend' ordeal. Being herself, she lacks the knowledge of \u201cromance\u201d and its ideas so she tries her best to break them apart. With her persistence, she often tries to interfere during their moments of \u201cromance\u201d. However unlike Masuzu, Chiwawa lacks confidence. Unfortunately for her, it seems that Eita only sees her as a childhood friend although at many occasions, he seems to put her in high regards and does truly care about her. Among other things though, Eita-kun also meets other girls which puts Chiwawa on even more stress when she realizes the many rivals to love. \\n\\n\r\nThose rivals would be Himeka Akishino who self-proclaims herself as Eita-kun's \u201cex-girlfriend\u201d. Her introduction invokes the wrath of not only Chiwawa but also Eita's fake girlfriend Masuzu. It becomes a battlefield and Himeka portrays herself as the \u201cBurning Princess Saint Dragon Lady of Dawn\u201d. It all happened after a certain event and after being a witness, she is determined to prove to Eita that she is his destined one. Too bad destiny doesn't land her well on the side of love. Speaking of which now, destiny presents another girl, the all loveable pink haired girl Ai Fuyuumi. She seems to play the role of the antithesis with her tsundere like features and delusions. In fact, she even has a little cute history but that would be spoilers. Watch the series and you'll see. \\n\\n\r\nWith these girls and Eita-kun in the mix, we have the formula for a harem. They all have different colored hair too but with different physiques. It also seems that at the same time, Eita can't seem to pick which one to choose. In fact, he still wants to escape from the idea of love and pursue a dream as a doctor. Well tough luck to Eita kun because this kid can't ever catch a break. From some of the episodes, he gets humiliated by the notebook, beat up by thugs, and caught up into countless misunderstandings in what some may see as an unwanted harem. It's a battlefield for all the girls and everyone to themselves. It also seems that at some occasions, Masuzu may generally care for Eita in a more romantic way as opposed to their fake relationship. Still though, it doesn't avoid the typical harem themes. We have the jealousy from the girls that often results from misunderstandings, the stalkers on dates to \u201cobserve\u201d what Eita is doing, and hell, even the traditional CPR scene. It gets old and overused . Let's not also forget the \u201ctransfer student\u201d theme, the childhood friend relationship, and even a case of the naked apron idea. It's Harem with a capital H.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is labeled as romantic comedy and surprisingly, it does have its comedy side. The idea of \u201clove\u201d is really played out during many episodes is weak though as I've yet to sense that feeling of real romance from any of the character. However, I admit that the comedy of the series is done surprisingly well.\\n\\n\r\nLet's see, there's the fun references of chuunibyou presented in many episodes involving Himeka and Eita. They imagine themselves as the \u201cBurning Fighting Fighter\u201d and \u201cBurning Princess Saint Dragon Lady of Dawn\u201d respectively. But of course, this theme isn't new to the anime industry especially in terms of romantic comedies. Yes, I'm looking at you, Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Other little fun gags in the series revolves around Masuzu who presents herself as a hardcore Jojo fan. In fact, she often uses references and quotes throughout the series to make humor. These often puts Eita in an embarrassing situation but amusement for Masuzu herself. It's not surprising though given her manipulative personality. Additionally, there's the idea of 'obvious lies' involving Ai. It's so obvious that her \u201cboyfriend\u201d doesn't really exist that it should be a big sign for anyone. Additionally, her strict policy of being a \u201chall monitor\u201d contradicts her personality as she herself seems to want fun. Yup, I personally found these little gags here and there amusing or at the very least presents comedy in a fun way. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, it seems that not all of these doesn't work out too well in the end. There's still fan service and the typical beach episode, the festival at night (with yukata for decoration), the obvious love triangle/square, and Eita being oblivious to certain things in life despite his intellect. I also personally found that Eita is a bit annoying to watch. Being a nice guy, he often wants to help others by putting himself at risk but I feel like he's not using his brain much. Although I admire his care for the other girls, I find that his actions presented are a bit weak to my liking. Additionally, I also find that Himeka's character to be way too blend and hardly stands out at all. In fact, at some occasions, I forget her existence in the show just like her delusions that are nonexistent. The love triangle is also weak too in my opinion. It seems that Eita doesn't wants any of them as a real girlfriend. In fact, it seems that the only thing he would marry would be a career and that is of being a doctor. Maybe, one of the girls should pursue a career in medicine or something to stand a better chance.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visuals, I had a hard time adjusting myself to watch this. Even being a manga fan, I would have to say that A-1 Pictures dropped the ball on this one. The characters are generic, washed out, and not to mention most of the scenes from this series are so bright that one might need sunglasses to get a true experience. The girls themselves also lacks any realism at all. Well, I guess some of the more humorous scenes are presented better visually but ultimately, this series only gets a '5' in the art department. I'm disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nI don't have too much complaints about the music/soundtrack of the series. However, that OP song \"Girlish Lover\" by Mizukara wo Enshutsu Suru Otome no Kai is like a buzz to my ears occasionally. It's very girlish (sticks with the title) and really tries to tell the viewers that this series is what it is: a romantic comedy with a harem. It's also funny how Eita doesn't seem to be in the OP song at all. It's almost if the girls in this show is the more dominant characters, not the guy. This is especially true for Masuzu. As regarding the background music, I find it just fine and sometimes amusing especially during a few of the guitar rhythms during those 'notebook scenes'.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, I will give this show a '6'. It's definitely a threat towards to a '5' scale though with its lack of characterization in Eita's harem. The main male protagonist, despite being kind, lacks any distinct features from what I see him as. As for the drama, it is presented in a more causal way rather than anything too serious. With seemingly no real winner in fact, this series is just a romantic comedy with a harem that our friend Eita-kun can hardly stand. Well, I could barely stand this series at many times but if you want to find some fun with its comedy parts, Oreshura might be worth a shot. If you want to pursue a doctor career yourself though, then save that precious time that you'll never be able to buy back; not even with blackmail.",

I love the Romantic comedy genre and its clichednees to be fair but hey it was a good laugh.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you like the clicheness of a Rom Com go for it. This provides the expected cliche story with no plot twisting or anything unexpected.

            "content": "Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru\r\nTo be honest, when I started this series, I was expecting a fresh, new romance anime about interesting character that \u201cgave up\u201d on love. This is not the case, the show had an opportunity to start an original Rom/Com by matching a hopeless guy who focuses on his studies rather than women who is then thrown feet first into a relationship he has no control over thus leading into shenanigans and mishaps but I was sorely mistaken.\r\nStory 6/10:\r\nThe plot was unoriginal and poorly executed. It lives up to its name as a Rom/Com by being unable to buildup a viable plot by relying heavily on comedy and simply sets up all the girls for Eita\u2019s harem. The pacing is rather fast as it only has 2 episodes to set up the story behind each of the girls and how they came to love Eita making sympathy hard to make with the characters. The characters are quite 1-dimensional and don\u2019t really have much outstanding features to them. There are a few exceptions to the plot\u2019s execution, when the story turns to the drama section, trying to touch the viewer\u2019s feelings, it succeeds. In the end, OreShura is mainly a show for the laughs and focuses on the comedy and romance is a side-dish.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nFrom background to character design, overall the art was great. It gave a happy atmosphere matching to that of a Rom/Com. The characters look unique and don\u2019t, magically, look the same as some animes tend to do. The lighting was well done but shadows seem somewhat lacking. Effects don\u2019t happen very often (love hearts and such) but in certain scenes for example, when Masuzu reads from Eita\u2019s notebook, it looks wonderful and nice to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nSound was great overall; it achieved engaging sounds which catches the viewer\u2019s attention with its background music and ambient sounds such as the sounds of busy streets and the ticking of a clock and is quite consistent as it doesn\u2019t suddenly become silent. The OP is very cheery and catchy which gets you into the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very clich\u00e9 and unoriginal. \\n\\n\r\nOur main character, Kidou Eita, who seems to be an interesting character by \u201cgiving up on love\u201d first, seems like a good idea but it has the opposite effect. Because of this, Eita is completely clueless in romance and is very dense about the girls around him. He is a recovering victim from \u201ceighth-grader syndrome\u201d which is held against his own will by the likes of Natsukawa Masuzu who uses it as blackmail.\\n\\n\r\nOur female leads aren\u2019t any better, our supposed idol, Masuzu, doesn\u2019t seem popular at all after the first episode despite this is one of her main traits, then we have the childhood friend (>_>) Chiwa, who is a failure in love unable to show her feeling to Eita, now we have Himeka, another victim of eight-grader syndrome who sticks to Eita like super glue, and finally we have the wonderful tsundere with pink hair, Ai, she uses her best friend (Whose gender can't be defined) as a wing(wo?)man. We now have a fleeting team of flavorless women lined up for Eita's harem. Not much exciting here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10:\\n\r\nIf it wasn\u2019t for the art and the big laughs every now and then, I might have given up on this series. If you are looking for an intricate plot with twists and turns, this is not for you. This is more of a comedy than a romance. The comedy certainly will make you laugh or at least chuckle once. If you love comedies, this is show if definitely for you.\\n",

            "content": "Usually I'm not the type to watch romantic comedies, only because of how cliche most are. This anime isn't an exception. Although what most rom-coms try to do is have a unique characteristic that separates from the normal. \r\nStory: 6\r\n The romantic comedies I've seen always has a typical setting for it's story. You've got your typical male somehow attracting people of the opposite sex to do your dirty work for you. Okay, that's a bit of an overstatement but you know what I mean. You have a new student who comes around and takes advantage of our main character Eita. He is entirely notinterested in love and is recovering from a middle school like syndrome where he has a mindset of thinking he's someone called \"Burning Fighting Fighter\". Because of this, she uses him as a way for other guys to not constantly ask her out by having him be her boyfriend, and to make sure he doesn't do anything wrong, she uses a notebook of his experience as the Burning Fighting Fighter. It sounds like a nice story to step foot on, but that's what really \"starts\" the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\n A unique aspect of this anime is it's art. Bright, vibrant colors that separates other anime. It's opening and ending truly stand out to show it's nice art. Although at some points it feels really bright as if someone wanted to turn the contrast of the anime to unnecessary amounts. Doesn't bug me, but people seem to be a bit annoyed by it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\n You've got your catchy opening and ending, enough to bring the audience to actually watch the first episode. It gets in your head for quite some time too. It's use of music during the anime doesn't interests me that much, but it's nice really. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\n Now this is when I'm a bit annoyed about the main character. Eita is extremely clueless when it comes to the girls showing their affection. ALL the girls like him. That's the point of a harem, but it's irritating to see how narrow-minded he is. Yes I know he's uninterested in love. I just never thought he'll be this clueless. He's still a likable character by being a helpful person to all his women. \\n\r\n There's a total of four girls that appear in the anime. First you have your mean, tsundere-like figure who uses Eita as she slowly starts liking him. Next you have your child-hood friend who doesn't like that fact that Eita is dating someone, as she has feelings for him too. You then have a character who similarly has a middle school syndrome and remembers Eita from her past life and wants to be united. Lastly you have another tsundere-like character who has a crush on Eita. I'm just trying to be brief about this as you have to watch the anime to find more back ground information about them, as it's what really drives the story forward.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\n It's an ok anime. I expected more from what it presented. It has a decent amount of comedy that makes you like some characters. At the end of each episode it doesn't really bring me in to watch the next one. Still, it's something to watch when you have your free time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\n Not the best. Not the worst. It's unique in a way with it's story and a bit of the characters. If you are looking for an anime that is a romantic comedy harem. Then step no further as this will fit your needs.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning: Spoilers \r\nOla, now I've finished watching this 13 ep anime, I'm gonna have to make my evaluation of this show. What we have was more like a generic harem, romance with comedy kind of anime where everything was predictable, except that this anime deviated from it's plot, where after ep 2 one would be surprise if the main character's role was no longer what it was suppose to be, in fact studio A-1 Pictures, focus more on the mismatched tandem than anything else.\r\n So, my category ratings: \r\nMediocre 5.\r\nStory- like I said, it was a basic harem type of an anime where the plotwas secondary and the focus was on the 2 mismatched pair namely Masuzu and Eita, the other members of the chico's harem were merely obstacles for the pair.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFair 6.\\n\\n\r\nArt- I'd probably say that, there isn't much any fanservice for the pirreos to howl about, and I have no qualms them girls being in bikinis, though Masuzu wasn't wearing any underwear it didn't look that malicious. I like the girls' uniform, however I don't like the boy's school uniform, now c'mon, that blue shirt with white collar matched with white pants? OH, this anime's illustrator has poor sense when it comes to guy's fashion.\\n\\n\r\nGood 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound- well then, the VA's really did match the characters voices and I'd like both the opening and the closing part of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- it was enjoyable to say the least when the main chico character defends the girls who would be mocked and the situation where you would like to know as to what happens next. Also, what make it it more enjoyable were the girls  would say those sweet 3 words to the main character ( Eita). I have to admit, that there were parts of this anime that I would like to slap the guys head for being stupid with the girls feelings.\\n\\n\r\nPathetic 1.\\n\\n\r\nArgh! I hate when that guy (Eita) has chosen that no good girl (Masuzu) over Ai, so the score was for him (Eita). Frankly, either he's very stupid or he just uses Masuzu so as to keep romance away from him, since he known that Masuzu was not a typical girl that one might not want to marry and have a family with, either way, I fell bad for those girls who have confess their feelings for him especially Chiwa. Since his role was to be this guy who shuns romance, his character should've been this cold and hated guy with a tsundere attitude, not only to all girls but to Masuzu as well and that Masuzu wasn't able to exercise any leverage on him \\n\\n\\n\r\nDreadful 2.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the fact that the main character (Eita) has chosen that girl (Masuzu) really makes this anime go downhill, now for studio A-1 Pictures to give this anime a U- turn by giving it harem ending was like adding insult to injury over us audience who are hoping that he'll pick anybody else than Masuzu. The said studio should have just let it have a harem ending than doing a U-turn.",

            "content": "Contrary to what one might believe, I actually approached 'Oreshura' with a positive mindset, and while I admit that I also approached it with a set of expectations, I was fully ready to abandon those pre-conceived notions if the series happened to differ.\r\nThe fact that Oreshura did indeed differ from my expectations is not a good thing, however. From the very beginning I expected that this series would take a sort of slice-of-life route, but this was in fact a grave misconception on my part as the series was actually a harem. Now, while I have no issue with a series making use with sucha format, Oreshura really brings nothing new and exciting to the table. Thus, herein lies the problem. \\n\\n\r\nAs a means of illustrating the issue I have with this series, allow me to do what any reviewer should, which is to dissect the series into its fundamental elements (e.g. the art and animation, the story, etc.) and to comment on each one, detailing what the series does well and vice versa.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Story-\\n\r\nWhile this is not the biggest flaw in this series, it is certainly a significant one and one that I must stress profusely. The story, essentially, follows a highschool student named Eita Kidou, who is black-mailed by a female student (Masuzu Natsukawa) as a means of forcing him into pretending to be her girlfriend. As such, other girls that are around him (who, for the most part, are childhood friends of his) begin to become jealous, leading into the show's harem aspects.\\n\\n\r\nThat, in all honesty, is the story of this show. Now, I should not be required to explain that such a plot is so unbelievably banal that one could easily predict how the series would play out from point A to point B. If one struggled with this, then they could certainly predict what sort ending the series would make use of. This is due to the fact that the series restricts itself to a rigid, linear structure. The protagonist is blackmailed and, as a result, ends up 'developing' feelings for the blackmailer. Because of this aforementioned linear structure, the show is unable to diversify and, in turn, fails to be unique in any aspect.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\r\nThe characters, if one could refer to them as such, are the weakest aspect of Oreshura. Why, you ask? Well, there are two reasons. First and foremost, as this is a generic harem, each character follows the conventions dictated by common characer archetypes that are seen in anime. We have all of the typical cast of characters: The blissfully unaware protagonist (Eita), the childhood friend (Chiwa), the tsundere  and other childhood friend (Ai), and finally, the highly irritating hussy that is Masuzu Natsukawa. The final mention brings me nicely into my explanation of the second reason for why the show's characterisation is its weakest aspect.\\n\\n\r\nThe second reason is, of course, that Oreshura's main heroine is the epitome of impertinence. As such, this renders her as a character that is difficult to tolerate, let alone one that the viewer can grow to love. While it is not necessary for a heroine to be likeable, it is necessary for the show to provide a valid reason for them acting in the manner that makes them so unlikable, which Oreshura tries to gloss over, so to speak.\\n\\n\r\nThus, we have a cast that is exceedingly generic and a main heroine that is very difficult, if not impossible, to tolerate due to the fact that a legitimate reason is never provided to compensate for her distasteful personality.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Art and Animation-\\n\r\nThe show's art style is definitely one of its stronger points. Each scene in Oreshura is vibrant and colourful, fitting in with the overall upbeat nature of the show. Even so, the art is not particularly detailed, making it seem somewhat lacklustre in comparison to other anime series.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of the show is, for the most part, consistent and fluid. That being said, there were certain points in the show where the animation was neglected, resulting in the inconsistent and unrealistic movement of vehicles, characters, and so on.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Music-\\n\r\nUnfortunately for Oreshura, the art and animation are the only redeeming feature of the show. The music used is not very memorable, and I personally found the opening theme of the show to be irritating, as opposed to catchy and enjoyable, which is what it was apparently trying to be.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Conclusion-\\n\r\nPerhaps the most important question would be whether or not I would recommend this anime series. My answer to this question is, obviously, no. However, if you intend to watch this show despite having read through this review, then I have no intention of stopping you. I do, however, recommend that you stream this show via a legal streaming website such as Crunchyroll, as opposed to purchasing a Blu-Ray and/or DVD release of the show. If you are reading this on Crunchyroll, please disregard the previous statement.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is far too generic and bland for me to recommend to any person. The characters do not undergo any development as they are restricted by the archetypes that they represent. This, in turn, makes the intended emotional points in the show seem far less believable and they ultimately fall flat as a result.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, a predictable ending makes the watching the show a pointless exercise, as one could easily surmise how the show would end, many episodes in advance.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Afterword-\\n\r\nWell, if you actually took the time to read through this review, I thank you. If you agree with my review, please feel free to say so. Likewise, if you happen to disagree with my review or have any advice which could help me improve upon my next review, please leave some feedback on my MAL or Crunchyroll profile page, depending on which website you are reading this on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\r\nPlease take the time to read the review. I refuse to summarise this review for those of you who are not willing to read through it in the first instance, or at the very least, skim through it.",

Not only was I pleased to see not one but more beautiful girls but from most of the series in my list this was amongst the ones I enjoyed the most. \"Why is that?\" you would ask yourself. Well it's like this: from my point of view, the lucky bastard, Eita inevitably draws around these girls due to the fact that he is nice. He desperately tries to make them disappear but they end up in a pinch and herushes over to help them thus deepening their bond with him.It makes me ask myself after watching similar series: \"Why do they always get the good ones?\"\\n\r\nNow, from Eita's perspective, a bunch of troublesome girls begin to pester him and he doesn't know why.He asks himself :\"How did I get stuck in this mess?\"\\n\\n\r\nThe Story itself is very enjoyable especially when it leads to open conflicts and for some reason it kept me happy while waiting for new episodes.\\n\r\nSo if you feel like  watching it I recommend it with warmth.",

            "content": "Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru, or My Girlfriend and Childhood Friend Fight too much, is pretty much what the name says. This show is a harem. However, I found it quite different from a lot of other harems.\r\nStory - 7/10:\r\nOkay, so this show is a romantic comedy/harem. Usually, I tend to try and avoid romantic comedy, because they all have kind of a similar theme or story. This show was not an exception, though there were a few aspects that I did like and stood out to me. I have not seen a show where the main character is AGAINST love. Thisis because of family reasons. Typically in a harem, the guy either doesn't care, or wants a harem, like Issei from Highschool DxD. But the main character here doesn't, which just made the story funnier. However, I understand the he is against love, but sometimes, he's just oblivious. Enough said about that. So we have a typical harem plot: mysterious girl appears and likes guy and has to fight with his childhood friend along with other girls, to get the guy. Nothing we haven't seen, right? Although some parts of the plot are nothing new, I found the whole \"Burning Fighting Fighter\" thing a funny twist, and I believe that Masuzu using the notebook to blackmail him was a new element that I hadn't seen. I'll talk more about the character later though. I gave that story a 7/10, because while some of this was nothing new, Oreshura managed to bring some new and unique elements into the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10:\\n\r\nThis show had very nice artwork. I really liked the style, and the bright colors matched the mood of the show well. Some people might not like it, or think it's silly, but I thought the art fit the show perfectly. The character design was nice, and they were easily distinguishable.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10:\\n\r\nThe sound for this show I believe served its purpose. I found that the OP and ED, Girlish Lover and Wonder Tale, fit the mood of the show perfectly, and were nice to watch. It was like a treat at the beginning and end of each episode. Not to mention the songs were catching, and it was nice to hear all of the main female cast sing in the full version of the OP. That said, there were times when music could have been better, like in the more dramatic parts of the show. Overall, the sound was enjoyable, and fit the show well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10:\\n\r\nOreshura had an interesting set of characters that made the show what it is. Eita is a high school boy who is against love for family reasons. Masuzu is a mysterious and beautiful transfer student who sits by Eita. Chiwa is Eita's childhood friend. Himeka is a girl who claims to know him in her previous life. Ai is a tsundere who has a crush on Eita. What do these characters have in common? They all have fellings for Eita. Chiwa has a great reason which I will not spoil. Himeka believes she was his princess in her past life. Ai also have a good reason that I will not spoil. Masuzu blackmails Eita into being her \"boyfriend\" so guys will stop asking her out, but grows to have feelings for him. The characters are not really unique, but nevertheless, fun to watch. It was nice to see all the characters progress and develop. What I found really great, was that there were times throughout the show when I was rooting for each of the girls, and it felt like they all had an equal chance at being with Eita. Although the rivalry was mainly between Masuzu and Chiwa, the girls all had a fair chance at times, and progressed equally.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10:\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this show, and it remains one of my favorites. It was very funny, and fun to watch. If you want a more serious, intense show, I would stay away, but if you want something fun and lighthearted, Oreshura might be for you. I enjoyed watching his girlfriend and childhood friend fight too much, and I believe the show did what it was supposed to: to entertain.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nI give Oreshura a 8/10. The story is good, the art fits the show great, the sound was nice, the characters were decent, and the show was enjoyable! I recommend this show and am hoping for a second season.",

Hate reading overly lengthy reviews and going through every unnecessary point as some of the reviewers do, so expect this one to be short (Ironically, didn't turn out to be so short.)\r\nScrolling through the other reviews left me wondering.\r\nAm I seriously the only one who thought this was such a wtf anime?\r\nSo, I loved the beginning, it sparked a great interest for me to see the rest of the anime and I liked the first half.\r\nThen the seventh episode came along andthings started getting... I don't even know how to describe it. I can't emphasize how weird and nonsensical the show started turning real fast..\\n\\n\r\nThe new girl, Himeka was introduced, there she was for one episode and was never noticable again. Literally one episode was all she got. She feels so unimportant, volumed down and received so much less screen time than the other three it makes me wonder why they even introduced her to the show. Hence, it was actually a fight between the other girls. \\n\\n\r\n*Minor spoilers*\\n\r\nThe two girls introduced at start, Chiwa and Masuzu, were going at each other in first half of the anime, then Ai came along and story mostly focused between the relationship between her and MC, main lead across 7-10 eps.\\n\r\nNow, that part about her crying when he promised her to heal her back injury wasn't even touched upon until practically the end and after going through the second half of the anime it felt so incredibly out of place\\n\r\nIn fact, everything that happened in first part felt like that, as if it was all forgotten.\\n\r\nThe pretending part was something I had completely forgotten about throughout the second part, as well as some other things I won't bring up since I already spoiled enough.* *\\n\\n\r\nThe last three episodes were so painfully uncomfortable and awkward for me to watch and enjoy. The relationship between the characters was so unclearly shown to me I couldn't even tell to which point did he come to with each individual girl.\\n\r\nYou know that feel when you watch a typical harem and you know which one is going to be picked, which ones are just extras and which ones will get the short end of stick? Yeah, nothing of sort is even remotely apparent here, except for the completely discriminated one I mentioned before, himeka.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I'm being crazy and stupid. I don't know, that's just how I feel about the show as a whole.",

And how it leaves the mind lingering in a positive way.\r\nIt is what it is guys. I cannot say much any further. Honestly what'd you expect from this anime, is what you are going to expect. BUT, It's really funny. It's so funny that it is worth watching. Not all the characters are funny, and you can expect the sweet love and harem from this. But it's something that gets you laughing,and gives you that feeling inside. I do like the outcome though. I won't say any spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\r\nEita Kido, a bookworm that aims to attend a medical school. He'd do anything. He'd even shun anything that has to do with romance and love. Masuzu Natsukawa, foreign and popular with guys. Who just happens to return from another country and was assigned a seat next to Kido. After a few days, Masuzu confessed to him in class, and blackmailed him after school on becoming her \"fake\" boyfriend so guys would stop asking her out. As time goes by for these two. Love only comes to one person.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nEita Kido, your main character. The smart guy that places at the top of school exams. Even though he's smart. He has these delusions and fantasies of addressing himself as \"Burning Fighting Fire\". A guy who win girls hearts, and battle monsters. After his childhood friend, Chiwa Harusaki's accident. He has to abandon his delusions. But his delusions still come out when things get too emotional. Oh, and obviously he cares for others and he's a nice guy. But you should expect that.\\n\\n\r\nChiwa Harusaki, childhood friend of Eita Kido. Also, a tomboy type. She used to be in the Kendo Club when she was little. Due to an injury from a car accident before high school, she has to quit. She's the closest one to Eita, out of all the other girls. Because she lives next to him, and loves Eita. It's a harem, just wanted to point it out their.\\n\\n\r\nMasuzu Natsukawa, Eita's \"girlfriend\". Spent most of her times overseas, and is considered the schools beauty. Confessed by many guys, and always shot them down. She used Eita's notebook, which has his \"fantasies\" to blackmail him. She might seem cruel, but truthfully she turns out to have a nice spot as the time goes by. \\n\\n\r\nHimeka Akishino, she has a one-sided crush on him. She also has some \"fantasies\" and \"delusions\" just like Eita. Since she comes in later. I'm not going to say much about her.\\n\\n\r\nAi Fuyuumi, to be blunt. She's Eita's \"fiancee\". She does come in late in the series. But she's really funny.\\n\\n\r\nKaoru Asoi, Eita's classmate and best friend. Who sat close to him until the seat change. I'll say this much, that I was surprised.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nIt's honestly one of the best anime I've seen that can keep my face smiling the whole time. I laughed a lot too. It's a simple Harem, romcom type deal. But it balances out. I would recommend it, and actually re-watch it with one of my friends. It's that funny guys, give it a shot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Thanks for reading (sorry for terrible typing, sensor sucks)\r\nAlright,  Im not in the best condittion to write a review, considering I smashed my computer and using a phone but I really want to change the negative view cast on this show thus far.\r\nPlease try not to mind typos cuz error seeking sucks\r\n- So I just began episode 7 confused cuz I totally forgot what happened last week. Ever fhave that happen to you? so I basically reviewed the last feww episodes and kinda getit better. Point? Ep 6 - 7, watch out:P\\n\\n\r\nAnyways to the main section. Ill condense my whole review into this single section. \\n\\n\r\nTis is twery fun to view, enjoyable and a nice watch. Sure, you may dislike a few heroines or two but with all of them, one is ought to flow your boat (a few lolis, tsundere etc.)\\n\\n\r\nThe art, music and animation are near perfect in my opinion. At the very least it does not hinder with the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are nice, with many different kinds so you will like a few and maybe dislike a few. Even so, some are just so adorable you can forgive the ones you dislike.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory, is mostly comedy, with  a few jojo references that I have no clue what it means (better get to watch jojo) but it is few and does not hinder the enjoyability.\\n\\n\r\nRating-9\\n\\n\r\nWhy? I watch it whenever it is released, no  questions asked and it cheers me up. Nice and good in almost every aspect and nothinng so harsh to make you go, crap lets hold it off, for like a year? (almost missed watching to aru majustu after touma got hit with the feather)\\n\\n\r\nMessage: WATCH OR AT LEAST TRY, mostly shounen tho. I have no clue how a girl would view this show but if you like harems, comedy, and multiple heroines, give it a shot. You have nothing to lose but a ton of joy to be gained from watching is terrific show\\n",

            "content": "(This is my opinion and this review **MIGHT CONTAIN LIGHT SPOILERS**)\r\nOverall score - 7/10\r\n\tThe anime overall uses has an uninteresting story and relies on cringe-based humor to keep the anime interesting. The characters were generic and not interesting. The sound and art was solid overall, no huge mistakes in animation was made either. It is a light hearted anime, so don't watch it if you are expecting a tear jerker.\r\nStory(6/10)- The story overall is a generic school harem with the main character being an overall average guy with the girls being a childhood friend, a shy girl, a demanding girl, etc. There is not muchmaking this anime different than others in the core aspects besides the fact that one of the girls pretends to be from the protagonist's past life which the protagonist made up when he was in middle school. The main protagonist is trying to hide his embarrassing past so he would not be seen as a chuunibyou that is where some of the cringe- humor comes into play. Besides the cringe-humor, there is nothing else that is really funny in this anime. The ending is both unexpected and disappointing at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5/10)- Like I said before, this anime has uninteresting characters. The main protagonist Eita is an average guy (for the most part) and he can't choose a girl he wants to be with, even though all of them would pretty much go to the semi-extreme to get him to like them. He knows that they like him, but, he is indecisive and that is another way this anime is not unique to other harems. Eita overall is uninteresting. The only interesting part about him is his relationship with his parent (which is skimmed over briefly which is a wasted opportunity) and his fantasies (which is highly over-used to a point where you don't care anymore). The main heroine Natsukawa is a popular girl that every guy had a crush on. She chooses the main protagonist because they are both \"anti-love\", meaning that they both despise love, which is ironic since they both of them start to make a liking for each other. You end up not liking Natsukawa as the anime goes on because she plots her plans to meddle with other peoples' lives and they show very little romantic angles with her and the protagonist. There are some romantic angles to remind the audience that she can still end up with the main protagonist. The childhood friend character Chiwa is the run-off-the-mill childhood friend who lives next to the protagonist and she knows \"everything\" about him. She had a big impact on how the main protagonist turned into how he is now in the anime as shown by the scenes from the past. But, it is too obvious that she likes him. It is painful to watch her try to get him to like her since it is very cringy. She stops relationships from forming with other girls from the anime which makes you dislike her as well. She tries to squeeze her way into the main protagonists's heart and that is what makes me dislike her.  Himeka is the shy girl that is EXTREMELY uninteresting.  She is just there in the anime. There is no point in her being there. The only thing she has going for her is her fantasizing with the main protagonist. Then we come to Ai, probably the only character who I really like in this anime. She is quirky in a good way. Her awkwardness just makes you want to love her. The way she tries to get close to the main protagonist and how the main protagonist's best friend helps her out plan out their next move makes her a likable character.  She actually attempts to hide her crush with the main protagonist unlike the other girls. She is the most likeable out of the bunch because of the way she reacts to the main protagonist. But, she ruins her own character by being over aggressive.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Art (8/10)- The music and art in the anime overall is solid. The music came at the right times and the art was average to say the least. There were no obvious mistakes in animation when it came to the finished product. The music is not unique or interesting however. For me, music in anime is absolutely essential. If the music is good, it could give that anime a few extra points. However, the background music was nothing to write home about. It was completely average. The opening is very annoying and predictable. They had the main heroines sing and it was overall annoying. I would skip the opening every time because of how annoying it is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment (7/10- Skippable)- It was an average anime to say the least. There is really nothing that I think separates it from other harems. You can pretty much watch another harem to get your harem fix if needed. But, it is not horrible. Overall it is a light hearted anime that you can watch to the side since it is a short series. I would recommend this anime for anyone needing a harem fix or a light hearted anime, but it is skippable.\\n\\n\r\n*Im not a huge fan of harems overall, so my opinion may be different from someone who adores harems.\\n",

            "content": "Anime storytelling lives and breathes within its own special world.  The better anime series radiate energy, creativity and professionalism: they may draw from many special anime \"worlds\" or genres while still appealing on several levels that transcend the limits of genre.  Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru, or Oreshura for short, certainly strikes a chord with me  (even tho its tagged as a Harem/Romantic Comedy anime).  The staff prove themselves keenly observant and talented, and can deliver the goods in story, voice, art, music, and production.\r\nI tend to let an anime reveal its story at its own pace, butbeyond its romantic comedy category, I found Oreshura to quickly establish its thing: playing with cultural tropes and interpersonal relationships.  The male protagonist Kidou Eita is depicted as a post-chuunibyou highschooler who is bent upon his studies, not all the \"love on the brain\" high school life he sees around himself.  Nevertheless he's helplessly swept into the romantic plans of several girls around him; the girls even form a high school club named Society Advocating Maidenly Excellence For All Girls, and a skeleton in his chuunibyou closet past is a key to dragging Kidou along.\\n\\n\r\nOreshura can pop surprises: Eita's aunt Saeko, a writer/creator at a gaming company, triggers the concluding story sequences by enrolling the girls in her company's publicity-event contest.  But throughout, this anime's strong points are its agility in turning up amusing displays of cultural awareness, its attractive artwork and color palette, and storyline flow.  Oreshura: charming and engaging.",

The strory felt plausible to me, like i could be that main protagonist who got asked by the most popular girl simply because he doesnt like love. Art was nice,but since im not an artist,i cant comment. Sound is technical and needs a certain set of skills to ruin that. Characters werent unique,atleast most of them werent, Masuzu was a rarer character,someone who doesnt like love,is bored by it and so chooses to pretend to date another person. Her apearancewasnt as unique,but like most other places was simply to say \"Spot the main protagonist\".",

            "content": "Opening Summary\r\nThere are many different harem anime, and many of them tend to be very similar (if not identical) to each other. In some ways, OreShura is no different than those. But with a great cast of characters and somewhat unique scenario, it manages to stand out, at least a little bit. For the sake of my own sanity, I'm gonna divide this review into 6 sections: Story, Art, Sound, Characters, My Enjoyment, and My Overall opinion of the anime. I'll make sure to keep it spoiler free. I'd just like to point out that these are my opinions and mine alone, so feel freeto disagree. With that aside, let's begin.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThe story is essentially your typical harem affair: An extremely dense main character (Eita) is starting high school with his childhood friend who harbors feelings for him (Chiwa), then suddenly a new, stereotypical, foreign, rich, school beauty appears (Masuzu) and decides the MC is going to be her boyfriend (but not really). Add in the delusional but devoted to the MC 8th grade syndrome girl who believes the two were lovers in a past life (Himeka), and his childhood fiance who he met before his childhood friend that manages to continue harboring feelings for him (Ai) and you have the pieces of a generic harem anime. While the plot is predictable and bland in many respects, the latter parts manage to be at least a bit unique with a few twists and it should be enough to keep you watching. Of note though is the somewhat iffy pacing, with one of the girls being first introduced more than halfway through the 13 episodes. It could have been laid out better or more efficiently if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has a very pleasant art style in my opinion, very colorful and vibrant with animations of faces and characters appearing smooth and well-detailed up close. Some of the background characters and art feels lazy by comparison, but it's not awful or something that would completely take you out of it by any means.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes for the anime are \"Girlish Lover\" by all the female lead's voice actresses, and \"W:Wonder Tale\" by Masuzu's voice actress, Yukari Tamura. Both are fairly pleasant pieces and fit the feel of the anime, even if the former is a bit childish. The anime's OST is decent as well, with nothing in particular standing out, but the songs that blend so perfectly in the background doing just enough to keep it flowing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nNow this is where someone could argue that OreShura shines. The cast of girls is one of the stronger you'll find in any harem, from the hopelessly law-abiding and marriage-obsessed Ai to the straight-faced and childish but terribly entertaining Himeka. Despite conforming to stereotypes of anime and manga of the same genre, the characters feel real and believable, with their dialogue going smooth and life-like, and their personalities being decent enough to feel compassionate towards them when the show calls for it. I especially liked Himeka and Chiwa's characters quite a bit, with both being great performances that can make you grow quite attached to them. Eita's character felt like a weak point (by comparison anyway), but then \\n\r\nagain, many harem MCs seem to be.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nSure, it was far from perfect. And some of the moments did make me cringe and shake my head, but it was an overall great ride. I can honestly say I wasn't bored once watching this anime. I was always waiting to see what happened next or how certain events would turn out. There were quite a few laughs too, even a bit of emotion (not nearly enough to induce tears if that's what you're looking for, sorry). Definitely an entertaining ride.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nWhile the anime lacks in its story and doesn't wow you with its soundtrack, its lovable cast of characters and entertaining (if a bit cliche) moments should help you trudge through it. Definitely not a \"MUST SEE OMG BEST ANIMU EVAR\" type show, but if you're looking for a decent harem with a likable cast, you could definitely do worse. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "ORESHURA REVIEW:\r\nMINDSET:\r\nA point five better than Your Generic Harem.\r\nSYNOPSIS:\r\nImagine Your typical harem plot: Male lead starts of living next with one chick who is the childhood friend. (do You know where this is going?) Then one day, he finds another semi-woman, who has majestically gushing silver hair, walking, she gallants over the empty battlefield of barrenity and storms of darkness, blinding her eyes of inner-cold heartedness... She finds, a regular guy, and procives... to play with he's mind like a playful whore, as she pretended to be he's girlfriend. If he tries to break up, she will give out he's note book to the restof the school, embarrassing the heck out of him! (and basically black mailing him) So, yes, Harem happens. (obvious fact)\\n\\n\r\nREVIEW:\\n\r\nLet's be real everyone, the whole show is pretty much a Harem all the way through, we have the childhood friend, the generic woman hoarding protagonist, the quiet girl, and the obvious love interest, tsundere, etc... Its also a \u201cLight Novel Adaptation\u201d which means it has a 95% to be turdful. However, this is the same case, but slightly better. Why it can only be summed up within two words: \u201cNatsukawa Misuzu\u201d Because:\\n\r\n Her character design is really beautiful. Period.\\n\r\n She's the very feisty type as she can be playing with the protagonists mind as she loves teasing him all through out the show.\\n\r\nShe actually develops, into a very sweet character, but still keeps the feistiness which I like.\\n\r\nMost of the time, she always seemed very happy and playful with this enjoyable aura.\\n\r\nYou just got to lover her personality.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Yes, she does have her emotional moments, and because of how well written she is, they actually work. However, for the rest of the cast; they are all Your completely generic archetypes used for like the seven millionth time! As they could not catch up with Misuzu's greatness, they are characters that I just can't take seriously as one of  the repeated formula for Harems these are far too overused. The story feels like a complete Harem, and You can pretty much predict whose girl is going to jump on the Woman Hoarding Lead's bed after the first episode. There are also JoJo refrences. Like, the author really loves JoJo, and he/she written Misuzu as a fangirl of JoJo, with some moment even stating flat out that this is JoJo refrence at some points in there interactions.\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, Oreshura is Your completely 95% run of the mil harem. Why 95%? Misuzu, You will only watch this show for Misuzu if You do not enjoy the exact same repeated formula over and over again. Without her, this review would'nt even exist, as the show will only exist as one of the masses amount of generic Harems being released in Japan. I know I can't make my review as detailed as I wanted it to be, but its a Harem made in 21st century Japan, so what do You expect for such cheap writing?\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation, is more colourful than Your average work it is very bright and not so serious blending very well with the whole show. The character designs look a little different, yet refreshing unlike big bouncy juggernauts, with a darker colour scheme. It does the job in a slightly better manner.\\n\r\nMusic however, is nothing to talk about, it just fits the mood, and that\u2019s all what it does. And the opening can also jump right in to be on par with the shows OST.\\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nFor some reason, this is one of the more obscure Harems I've noticed. Not as if anyone would care that this show exists, but for what its worth, people will only watch this show for Misuzu, even after 10 decades.\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\n3/10 - 100% generic Harem plot all the way through.\\n\r\n3.5/10 \u2013 As added 0.5 points for Misuzu alone.\\n\r\n6.5/10 \u2013 For bright Animation and some really nice designs that sets itself apart from a completely generic Harem. \\n\r\n4/10 - A completely forgettable OST, that gets the job done, without anything kind of noteworthy.\\n\r\n4/10 \u2013 As Misuzu is the only character who will be entertaining You in a boring Harem.\\n\\n\r\nFINALE: 4.5/10 \u2013 For Masuzu. (only added a 0.5 to the generic Harem score)e XXX.",

            "content": "(2017 EDIT: Anime has JoJo references.)\r\nOreshura is just another harem rom com. It has nothing special about it and it doesn't stand out much at all. Yet it's really likable and you can't find many reasons to hate it. The reason is probably because as plain as it is, it does what it's supposed to do pretty well. \r\nThe story was decent (7). It wasn't special but it wasn't boring either. In fact, it didn't have much of a story. It's pretty much about a childhood friend trying to get the protagonist back to her from his kind-of-evil girlfriend, while more harem members join thecrew along the way. The different thing about this is the super lighthearted tone. To me this is what basically sets the anime apart from the others of the same genre. Oh, but it could also be because the protagonist ACTUALLY chooses someone in the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe art suited the lighthearted tone really well (8). The light colors gave off a watercolor like feel to it and it went well with the character design which together made it really cute, or rather, attractive. There should be more anime with this type of art, and I think it would go well with a lot of romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound/music suited the art and story perfectly (8). Of course it wasn't brilliant or outstanding, but it was fun and very well done -lol- , and the opening and ending were really cute, or rather, attractive. The BGM suited the comedic moments really well too.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters got me pleasantly surprised (8). For a generic harem, you can't expect too much out of the characters. You would expect (or I expected) the main character to be an ordinary, plain and boring person who can't make any decisions by himself, has the school idol at his feet every day but still refuses to notice her, who's parents are either dead or somewhere abroad, a non-blood related sister who would happen to have a crush on him, a perverted,wacko best friend who makes the MC look mature and reliable, when he himself has a porn mag stashed somewhere, etc. I could go on and on but that isn't the point I was trying to make, which is that the main character is actually likable. The essence of a harem anime are the harem members, not the leader himself. If the leader was more interesting than the members he would seem like a member himself. This MC is neither almost non-existent nor is he super fancy. He's just a nice guy who isn't overly anything and isn't annoying in the slightest. There is no imouto. There is no wacko friend, but instead a super sweet trap/friend. Yes, his doesn't live with his parents, but there's a story as to why things are like that. And his chuunibyo makes him pretty hilarious too. Most of the other characters are based on regular harem archetypes, but what makes them different is how funny, embarrassing and nice they all seem to be to each other. No two characters are alike, which is another plus point in harems.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment is over 9000 for me (even though I'm limited to putting a 10). This was a short and entertaining anime with the least offense I've seen an anime of its genre pull off. I'd recommend it to anyone who's just finished watching Corpse Party or something.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is one of the neatest of its type and is a fun show for anyone who doesn't hate Harem with their life (9). It's just a quick, fun way to spend some time.\\n\\n\r\n(My first proper review)\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Ore Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru\" Quite a long and complicated name. As the name states it, yes, it's a warzone between a childhood friend and the girlfriend with the addition of another two comic relief character.\r\nStory, 6/10:\r\nFor the story, well, people may thought, 'Hey, this must be another simple harem show again. whatever, i'll just watch it for fun'. Yeah, at first, i was like that, then, after a certain episode, the story was getting even more exciting. And to think that each and every one of the girls were given fair chances in getting the guy. \r\nOne thing that i really likeabout this show is that, it didn't feel rush. Everything went smoothly with the flow. Although there were moments where you would be like, ' whuh?' but it was still good.\\n\r\nI gave it a 6/10 score because the story didn't reached the climax where it should have been. And a few other scenes that should be so powerful, but ended up with a 'meh'\\n\\n\r\nArt, 8/10:\\n\r\nOne good thing about this anime is the art style. Some people might be disturbed by the light coloured theme, but for me, i loved it! It was so refreshing and so cheerful. God, the opening was so full of colours, i was caught by the colours myself. \\n\r\nThe character design was okay i guess. Although there were some scenes where the character's face was a bit weird. \\n\\n\r\nSound, 7/10:\\n\r\nI would say that the Sound in the anime played a not-so-much part in most of the massive scenes, where it should be. So yeah, maybe that's one of the reason why i feel the climax didn't reach the peak where i think it should have been.\\n\r\nThe OP and ED played a major role in setting up the cheerful atmosphere. I love the OP. Hahaha.\\n\r\nFor the second last episode, the ED played a major role  in setting the mood for the last episode. I can't tell you what it's about, but it was aweesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, 8/10:\\n\r\nSo in this harem, we have the genki girl, Harusaki Chiwa, the tsundere, Fuyuumi Ai, the chuunibyou, Akishino Himeka and the beauty, Natsukawa Masuzu. \\n\r\nUsually, in a harem anime, the main guy would be a total clueless dumbass that didn't even notice a girl likes him even after that girl confessed to him. But Eita, is not like that. he may be clueless at times, not because he is dumb, it's because of the family affairs which made him not to trust love. \\n\r\nAnd yes, i would believe that kind of reasoning, family problems could turn a person into anything.\\n\r\nThen, there's Chiwa, the childhood friend, fell in love with him after a certain incident(I won't spoil it). Also, has a bulletproof reason to love him.\\n\r\nMasuzu in the other hand, doesn't have any reason to love Eita, but she develops feelings for him later on. and i must say, watching Masuzu grew from the beginning to the end is really fun and sweet at times. although she can be a jerk.\\n\r\nHimeke and Ai, were practically the comic relief love interest. But even so, their reasoning to fell in love with Eita were both solid rock. Yes, even for a side character, i was rooting for Ai at some point.\\n\r\nA bunch of 'the usual' harem character but with interesting backgrounds and solid reason to why they like the same guy. Trust me, you won't get bored with any one of these characters, ever.\\n\r\nIf only, every harem makes sense like this one...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 8/10:\\n\r\nWhen the episode is getting dull, or the start of a new mission, behold! The Burning Fighting Fighter Notebook of Darkness!\\n\r\nHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!\\n\r\nYES, It was so embarrassing, i can't stop laughing. \\n\r\nAnyway, besides that, watching every singe one of the characters(including the aunt) developed at a same rate was really enjoying. every single one of them had a fair chance, even Kaoru. Yes, Kaoru. If only Kaoru was in the harem circle....\\n\\n\r\nOverall. 7/10:\\n\r\nLike it's title, 'My girlfriend and childhood friend fight too much'. i agreed on that 100% percent. Because, it was all about a childhood friend and his gilrfriend. Ai and Himeka were just there. One of my favourite thing about the anime was watching Masuzu and Chiwa fought.\\n\r\n*cough* *cough* the last scene in the final episode, yup. i love that scene. eventhough there were no sparks between them, i swear i saw them inside my head.\\n\r\nit was so intense that it was so good.\\n\r\nCredits to the huge character developments in Masuzu. And yes, now i'm stuck between both of them.\\n\r\nIf the harem is bad, you'll like every characters in the harem circle, if the harem is okay, you would like only one of them but if the harem is good, you would stuck in choosing which one is the best.\\n\r\nYes, even now, i didn't see any winners yet. Not common for an anime but it's OreShura, where everything were for a reason. \\n\\n\r\nP/s:\\n\r\nI am rooting for second season!! No notebook, less comic relief, more love pentagon. Instead of being 80% comedy 20% romance, my guess, it would be 25% comedy, 25% serious and 50% romance for the next season. I wanna know more about Masuzu's family.\\n\\n\r\nIf you really like something refreshing to watch, watch OreShura. But if you think too much and more towards serious stuffs, don't watch it.",

            "content": "Alright, here's the deal. \r\nWell, there's no deal; not for a certain lucky or rather unlucky guy named Eita Kido anyways. The thing is, he gets blackmailed in the most embarrassing way possible. Now he's nothing more than a little boy toy to a certain admired beauty at school. But hey, at least he's getting a hot girl with a manipulative personality yet someone \u201ccares\u201d about him in some way right? That's not what it seems to be...\r\nWait, this is a bit too fast. Let's start from the beginning.\r\nOre no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru (God damn that is a long name, so Iwill call it 'Oreshura' instead), is an anime series that debuted in 2013 based on the LN written by Yuji Yuji. The Japanese title literally translates to:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cMy Girlfriend and Childhood Friend Fight Too Much\u201d\\n\\n\r\nYA THINK?\\n\\n\r\nWell, the series does display that theme quite a bit. For starters, we got this kid named Eita Kidou who is in his puberty years in high school. He's a normal high school student with a healthy body. At that age, most boys would think about girls, right? No, in his case, the only thing is in mind is to study, study, and study. In fact, he hopes to become a doctor. (for a friend's sake) Well hell, if anyone tries to make that into a goal, we should all envision on the journey to get there. It's not an easy task being a doctor and saving lives, not to mention the amount of education you need to obtain the occupation. This also came from some bad memories from his past related to his parents. (poor kid) And beyond that, he has decided to eradicate the thought of \u201clove\u201d from his thoughts. In other words, the only focus on his mind is to achieve his goal, with absolution regardless of the costs. Oh but life just isn't so easy for this kid because there's one BIG problem:\\n\\n\r\nMasuzu Natsukawa \\n\\n\r\nShe's a mysterious transfer student where after nine long years came to his school all the way from Sweden. She has silver hair and in anime logic, we all know that's an attractive trait. In real life though, that's probably bizarre. But at any rate, this girl quickly becomes the talk of the school where boys instantly becomes attracted to her. On the other hand, Eita is just being Eita there with no second thoughts related to her. That is of course till one faithful day. After a certain incident, it seems that Eita becomes blackmailed by a certain notebook (Death Note reference anyone?) and now is literally forced to play the role of a \u201cboyfriend\u201d for Masuzu. It's basically an offer he can't refuse!\\n\\n\r\nOf course, in today's anime industry, the concept of the 'fake boyfriend/girlfriend' theme is not new. It's literally a palm in the face at occasions where we watch a fake couple doing fake things that are expressed as fake romance. It's overused all over the world but hey, it's still here. The fact that Eita and Masuzu are a \u201ccouple\u201d means that they are the talk of the school and among other things, an obstacle for both Eita and his childhood friend Chiwa Harusaki. That's because Eita promised to become a doctor in order to help her with the injury that she endured during her times as a kendo specialist.\\n\\n\r\nNow regarding Chiwa, this girl gave the word 'annoying' a whole new meaning. With a lack of any sex appeal, an annoying mouth, and obliviousness to a lot of things, she plays the mascot of the show. In fact, she is even nicknamed as Chiwawa as a pun for chihuahua. This is because her petite figure and hairstyle resembles those of a puppy. Well, let's not forget about her mouth of course because a puppy barks when annoyed and Chiwawa here is no different. Sorry Chiwawa fans.\\n\\n\r\nShe brings on some early drama in the series after finding out about the whole fake 'boyfriend/girlfriend' ordeal. Being herself, she lacks the knowledge of \u201cromance\u201d and its ideas so she tries her best to break them apart. With her persistence, she often tries to interfere during their moments of \u201cromance\u201d. However unlike Masuzu, Chiwawa lacks confidence. Unfortunately for her, it seems that Eita only sees her as a childhood friend although at many occasions, he seems to put her in high regards and does truly care about her. Among other things though, Eita-kun also meets other girls which puts Chiwawa on even more stress when she realizes the many rivals to love. \\n\\n\r\nThose rivals would be Himeka Akishino who self-proclaims herself as Eita-kun's \u201cex-girlfriend\u201d. Her introduction invokes the wrath of not only Chiwawa but also Eita's fake girlfriend Masuzu. It becomes a battlefield and Himeka portrays herself as the \u201cBurning Princess Saint Dragon Lady of Dawn\u201d. It all happened after a certain event and after being a witness, she is determined to prove to Eita that she is his destined one. Too bad destiny doesn't land her well on the side of love. Speaking of which now, destiny presents another girl, the all loveable pink haired girl Ai Fuyuumi. She seems to play the role of the antithesis with her tsundere like features and delusions. In fact, she even has a little cute history but that would be spoilers. Watch the series and you'll see. \\n\\n\r\nWith these girls and Eita-kun in the mix, we have the formula for a harem. They all have different colored hair too but with different physiques. It also seems that at the same time, Eita can't seem to pick which one to choose. In fact, he still wants to escape from the idea of love and pursue a dream as a doctor. Well tough luck to Eita kun because this kid can't ever catch a break. From some of the episodes, he gets humiliated by the notebook, beat up by thugs, and caught up into countless misunderstandings in what some may see as an unwanted harem. It's a battlefield for all the girls and everyone to themselves. It also seems that at some occasions, Masuzu may generally care for Eita in a more romantic way as opposed to their fake relationship. Still though, it doesn't avoid the typical harem themes. We have the jealousy from the girls that often results from misunderstandings, the stalkers on dates to \u201cobserve\u201d what Eita is doing, and hell, even the traditional CPR scene. It gets old and overused . Let's not also forget the \u201ctransfer student\u201d theme, the childhood friend relationship, and even a case of the naked apron idea. It's Harem with a capital H.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is labeled as romantic comedy and surprisingly, it does have its comedy side. The idea of \u201clove\u201d is really played out during many episodes is weak though as I've yet to sense that feeling of real romance from any of the character. However, I admit that the comedy of the series is done surprisingly well.\\n\\n\r\nLet's see, there's the fun references of chuunibyou presented in many episodes involving Himeka and Eita. They imagine themselves as the \u201cBurning Fighting Fighter\u201d and \u201cBurning Princess Saint Dragon Lady of Dawn\u201d respectively. But of course, this theme isn't new to the anime industry especially in terms of romantic comedies. Yes, I'm looking at you, Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! Other little fun gags in the series revolves around Masuzu who presents herself as a hardcore Jojo fan. In fact, she often uses references and quotes throughout the series to make humor. These often puts Eita in an embarrassing situation but amusement for Masuzu herself. It's not surprising though given her manipulative personality. Additionally, there's the idea of 'obvious lies' involving Ai. It's so obvious that her \u201cboyfriend\u201d doesn't really exist that it should be a big sign for anyone. Additionally, her strict policy of being a \u201chall monitor\u201d contradicts her personality as she herself seems to want fun. Yup, I personally found these little gags here and there amusing or at the very least presents comedy in a fun way. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, it seems that not all of these doesn't work out too well in the end. There's still fan service and the typical beach episode, the festival at night (with yukata for decoration), the obvious love triangle/square, and Eita being oblivious to certain things in life despite his intellect. I also personally found that Eita is a bit annoying to watch. Being a nice guy, he often wants to help others by putting himself at risk but I feel like he's not using his brain much. Although I admire his care for the other girls, I find that his actions presented are a bit weak to my liking. Additionally, I also find that Himeka's character to be way too blend and hardly stands out at all. In fact, at some occasions, I forget her existence in the show just like her delusions that are nonexistent. The love triangle is also weak too in my opinion. It seems that Eita doesn't wants any of them as a real girlfriend. In fact, it seems that the only thing he would marry would be a career and that is of being a doctor. Maybe, one of the girls should pursue a career in medicine or something to stand a better chance.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visuals, I had a hard time adjusting myself to watch this. Even being a manga fan, I would have to say that A-1 Pictures dropped the ball on this one. The characters are generic, washed out, and not to mention most of the scenes from this series are so bright that one might need sunglasses to get a true experience. The girls themselves also lacks any realism at all. Well, I guess some of the more humorous scenes are presented better visually but ultimately, this series only gets a '5' in the art department. I'm disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nI don't have too much complaints about the music/soundtrack of the series. However, that OP song \"Girlish Lover\" by Mizukara wo Enshutsu Suru Otome no Kai is like a buzz to my ears occasionally. It's very girlish (sticks with the title) and really tries to tell the viewers that this series is what it is: a romantic comedy with a harem. It's also funny how Eita doesn't seem to be in the OP song at all. It's almost if the girls in this show is the more dominant characters, not the guy. This is especially true for Masuzu. As regarding the background music, I find it just fine and sometimes amusing especially during a few of the guitar rhythms during those 'notebook scenes'.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, I will give this show a '6'. It's definitely a threat towards to a '5' scale though with its lack of characterization in Eita's harem. The main male protagonist, despite being kind, lacks any distinct features from what I see him as. As for the drama, it is presented in a more causal way rather than anything too serious. With seemingly no real winner in fact, this series is just a romantic comedy with a harem that our friend Eita-kun can hardly stand. Well, I could barely stand this series at many times but if you want to find some fun with its comedy parts, Oreshura might be worth a shot. If you want to pursue a doctor career yourself though, then save that precious time that you'll never be able to buy back; not even with blackmail.",

            "content": "Oreshura is the typical romantic comedy/ harem with a light hearted tone. It goes around the idea of conflict between the cunning of the protagonist \"girl friend\" and jealousy from his childhood friend over him. Throw in some secondary characters and this love triangle becomes pentagon. \r\nStory: At times its quirky, funny and light; a perfect feel good anime story. I felt that some of the character development stories were too cliche, uninspired and just boring to watch. \r\nSound: Decent music, good voice acting, and appropriate sound effects. What more could you ask for.\r\nArt: the art style of bright and water colored characters really helpsgive out a fun and non-serious tone that the anime projects. It excels at that point.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: It is Cliched to the max in character plots. There are two Childhood friends, one tsundere, one odd ball and one cunning schemer. The protagonist also falls into the former delusional middle schooler back-story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Hey the show itself was a lot of fun with a lot of nice feel good romantic conflict. I love the Romantic comedy genre and its clichednees to be fair but hey it was a good laugh.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you like the clicheness of a Rom Com go for it. This provides the expected cliche story with no plot twisting or anything unexpected. However, for anyone who does not enjoy the genre or expects any significant plot or character development get ready to be disappointed .",

            "content": "Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru\r\nTo be honest, when I started this series, I was expecting a fresh, new romance anime about interesting character that \u201cgave up\u201d on love. This is not the case, the show had an opportunity to start an original Rom/Com by matching a hopeless guy who focuses on his studies rather than women who is then thrown feet first into a relationship he has no control over thus leading into shenanigans and mishaps but I was sorely mistaken.\r\nStory 6/10:\r\nThe plot was unoriginal and poorly executed. It lives up to its name as a Rom/Com by being unable to buildup a viable plot by relying heavily on comedy and simply sets up all the girls for Eita\u2019s harem. The pacing is rather fast as it only has 2 episodes to set up the story behind each of the girls and how they came to love Eita making sympathy hard to make with the characters. The characters are quite 1-dimensional and don\u2019t really have much outstanding features to them. There are a few exceptions to the plot\u2019s execution, when the story turns to the drama section, trying to touch the viewer\u2019s feelings, it succeeds. In the end, OreShura is mainly a show for the laughs and focuses on the comedy and romance is a side-dish.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nFrom background to character design, overall the art was great. It gave a happy atmosphere matching to that of a Rom/Com. The characters look unique and don\u2019t, magically, look the same as some animes tend to do. The lighting was well done but shadows seem somewhat lacking. Effects don\u2019t happen very often (love hearts and such) but in certain scenes for example, when Masuzu reads from Eita\u2019s notebook, it looks wonderful and nice to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nSound was great overall; it achieved engaging sounds which catches the viewer\u2019s attention with its background music and ambient sounds such as the sounds of busy streets and the ticking of a clock and is quite consistent as it doesn\u2019t suddenly become silent. The OP is very cheery and catchy which gets you into the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very clich\u00e9 and unoriginal. \\n\\n\r\nOur main character, Kidou Eita, who seems to be an interesting character by \u201cgiving up on love\u201d first, seems like a good idea but it has the opposite effect. Because of this, Eita is completely clueless in romance and is very dense about the girls around him. He is a recovering victim from \u201ceighth-grader syndrome\u201d which is held against his own will by the likes of Natsukawa Masuzu who uses it as blackmail.\\n\\n\r\nOur female leads aren\u2019t any better, our supposed idol, Masuzu, doesn\u2019t seem popular at all after the first episode despite this is one of her main traits, then we have the childhood friend (>_>) Chiwa, who is a failure in love unable to show her feeling to Eita, now we have Himeka, another victim of eight-grader syndrome who sticks to Eita like super glue, and finally we have the wonderful tsundere with pink hair, Ai, she uses her best friend (Whose gender can't be defined) as a wing(wo?)man. We now have a fleeting team of flavorless women lined up for Eita's harem. Not much exciting here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10:\\n\r\nIf it wasn\u2019t for the art and the big laughs every now and then, I might have given up on this series. If you are looking for an intricate plot with twists and turns, this is not for you. This is more of a comedy than a romance. The comedy certainly will make you laugh or at least chuckle once. If you love comedies, this is show if definitely for you.\\n",

            "content": "Usually I'm not the type to watch romantic comedies, only because of how cliche most are. This anime isn't an exception. Although what most rom-coms try to do is have a unique characteristic that separates from the normal. \r\nStory: 6\r\n The romantic comedies I've seen always has a typical setting for it's story. You've got your typical male somehow attracting people of the opposite sex to do your dirty work for you. Okay, that's a bit of an overstatement but you know what I mean. You have a new student who comes around and takes advantage of our main character Eita. He is entirely notinterested in love and is recovering from a middle school like syndrome where he has a mindset of thinking he's someone called \"Burning Fighting Fighter\". Because of this, she uses him as a way for other guys to not constantly ask her out by having him be her boyfriend, and to make sure he doesn't do anything wrong, she uses a notebook of his experience as the Burning Fighting Fighter. It sounds like a nice story to step foot on, but that's what really \"starts\" the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\n A unique aspect of this anime is it's art. Bright, vibrant colors that separates other anime. It's opening and ending truly stand out to show it's nice art. Although at some points it feels really bright as if someone wanted to turn the contrast of the anime to unnecessary amounts. Doesn't bug me, but people seem to be a bit annoyed by it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\n You've got your catchy opening and ending, enough to bring the audience to actually watch the first episode. It gets in your head for quite some time too. It's use of music during the anime doesn't interests me that much, but it's nice really. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\n Now this is when I'm a bit annoyed about the main character. Eita is extremely clueless when it comes to the girls showing their affection. ALL the girls like him. That's the point of a harem, but it's irritating to see how narrow-minded he is. Yes I know he's uninterested in love. I just never thought he'll be this clueless. He's still a likable character by being a helpful person to all his women. \\n\r\n There's a total of four girls that appear in the anime. First you have your mean, tsundere-like figure who uses Eita as she slowly starts liking him. Next you have your child-hood friend who doesn't like that fact that Eita is dating someone, as she has feelings for him too. You then have a character who similarly has a middle school syndrome and remembers Eita from her past life and wants to be united. Lastly you have another tsundere-like character who has a crush on Eita. I'm just trying to be brief about this as you have to watch the anime to find more back ground information about them, as it's what really drives the story forward.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\n It's an ok anime. I expected more from what it presented. It has a decent amount of comedy that makes you like some characters. At the end of each episode it doesn't really bring me in to watch the next one. Still, it's something to watch when you have your free time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\n Not the best. Not the worst. It's unique in a way with it's story and a bit of the characters. If you are looking for an anime that is a romantic comedy harem. Then step no further as this will fit your needs.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning: Spoilers \r\nOla, now I've finished watching this 13 ep anime, I'm gonna have to make my evaluation of this show. What we have was more like a generic harem, romance with comedy kind of anime where everything was predictable, except that this anime deviated from it's plot, where after ep 2 one would be surprise if the main character's role was no longer what it was suppose to be, in fact studio A-1 Pictures, focus more on the mismatched tandem than anything else.\r\n So, my category ratings: \r\nMediocre 5.\r\nStory- like I said, it was a basic harem type of an anime where the plotwas secondary and the focus was on the 2 mismatched pair namely Masuzu and Eita, the other members of the chico's harem were merely obstacles for the pair.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFair 6.\\n\\n\r\nArt- I'd probably say that, there isn't much any fanservice for the pirreos to howl about, and I have no qualms them girls being in bikinis, though Masuzu wasn't wearing any underwear it didn't look that malicious. I like the girls' uniform, however I don't like the boy's school uniform, now c'mon, that blue shirt with white collar matched with white pants? OH, this anime's illustrator has poor sense when it comes to guy's fashion.\\n\\n\r\nGood 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound- well then, the VA's really did match the characters voices and I'd like both the opening and the closing part of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- it was enjoyable to say the least when the main chico character defends the girls who would be mocked and the situation where you would like to know as to what happens next. Also, what make it it more enjoyable were the girls  would say those sweet 3 words to the main character ( Eita). I have to admit, that there were parts of this anime that I would like to slap the guys head for being stupid with the girls feelings.\\n\\n\r\nPathetic 1.\\n\\n\r\nArgh! I hate when that guy (Eita) has chosen that no good girl (Masuzu) over Ai, so the score was for him (Eita). Frankly, either he's very stupid or he just uses Masuzu so as to keep romance away from him, since he known that Masuzu was not a typical girl that one might not want to marry and have a family with, either way, I fell bad for those girls who have confess their feelings for him especially Chiwa. Since his role was to be this guy who shuns romance, his character should've been this cold and hated guy with a tsundere attitude, not only to all girls but to Masuzu as well and that Masuzu wasn't able to exercise any leverage on him \\n\\n\\n\r\nDreadful 2.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the fact that the main character (Eita) has chosen that girl (Masuzu) really makes this anime go downhill, now for studio A-1 Pictures to give this anime a U- turn by giving it harem ending was like adding insult to injury over us audience who are hoping that he'll pick anybody else than Masuzu. The said studio should have just let it have a harem ending than doing a U-turn.",

            "content": "Contrary to what one might believe, I actually approached 'Oreshura' with a positive mindset, and while I admit that I also approached it with a set of expectations, I was fully ready to abandon those pre-conceived notions if the series happened to differ.\r\nThe fact that Oreshura did indeed differ from my expectations is not a good thing, however. From the very beginning I expected that this series would take a sort of slice-of-life route, but this was in fact a grave misconception on my part as the series was actually a harem. Now, while I have no issue with a series making use with sucha format, Oreshura really brings nothing new and exciting to the table. Thus, herein lies the problem. \\n\\n\r\nAs a means of illustrating the issue I have with this series, allow me to do what any reviewer should, which is to dissect the series into its fundamental elements (e.g. the art and animation, the story, etc.) and to comment on each one, detailing what the series does well and vice versa.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Story-\\n\r\nWhile this is not the biggest flaw in this series, it is certainly a significant one and one that I must stress profusely. The story, essentially, follows a highschool student named Eita Kidou, who is black-mailed by a female student (Masuzu Natsukawa) as a means of forcing him into pretending to be her girlfriend. As such, other girls that are around him (who, for the most part, are childhood friends of his) begin to become jealous, leading into the show's harem aspects.\\n\\n\r\nThat, in all honesty, is the story of this show. Now, I should not be required to explain that such a plot is so unbelievably banal that one could easily predict how the series would play out from point A to point B. If one struggled with this, then they could certainly predict what sort ending the series would make use of. This is due to the fact that the series restricts itself to a rigid, linear structure. The protagonist is blackmailed and, as a result, ends up 'developing' feelings for the blackmailer. Because of this aforementioned linear structure, the show is unable to diversify and, in turn, fails to be unique in any aspect.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\r\nThe characters, if one could refer to them as such, are the weakest aspect of Oreshura. Why, you ask? Well, there are two reasons. First and foremost, as this is a generic harem, each character follows the conventions dictated by common characer archetypes that are seen in anime. We have all of the typical cast of characters: The blissfully unaware protagonist (Eita), the childhood friend (Chiwa), the tsundere  and other childhood friend (Ai), and finally, the highly irritating hussy that is Masuzu Natsukawa. The final mention brings me nicely into my explanation of the second reason for why the show's characterisation is its weakest aspect.\\n\\n\r\nThe second reason is, of course, that Oreshura's main heroine is the epitome of impertinence. As such, this renders her as a character that is difficult to tolerate, let alone one that the viewer can grow to love. While it is not necessary for a heroine to be likeable, it is necessary for the show to provide a valid reason for them acting in the manner that makes them so unlikable, which Oreshura tries to gloss over, so to speak.\\n\\n\r\nThus, we have a cast that is exceedingly generic and a main heroine that is very difficult, if not impossible, to tolerate due to the fact that a legitimate reason is never provided to compensate for her distasteful personality.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Art and Animation-\\n\r\nThe show's art style is definitely one of its stronger points. Each scene in Oreshura is vibrant and colourful, fitting in with the overall upbeat nature of the show. Even so, the art is not particularly detailed, making it seem somewhat lacklustre in comparison to other anime series.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of the show is, for the most part, consistent and fluid. That being said, there were certain points in the show where the animation was neglected, resulting in the inconsistent and unrealistic movement of vehicles, characters, and so on.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Music-\\n\r\nUnfortunately for Oreshura, the art and animation are the only redeeming feature of the show. The music used is not very memorable, and I personally found the opening theme of the show to be irritating, as opposed to catchy and enjoyable, which is what it was apparently trying to be.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Conclusion-\\n\r\nPerhaps the most important question would be whether or not I would recommend this anime series. My answer to this question is, obviously, no. However, if you intend to watch this show despite having read through this review, then I have no intention of stopping you. I do, however, recommend that you stream this show via a legal streaming website such as Crunchyroll, as opposed to purchasing a Blu-Ray and/or DVD release of the show. If you are reading this on Crunchyroll, please disregard the previous statement.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is far too generic and bland for me to recommend to any person. The characters do not undergo any development as they are restricted by the archetypes that they represent. This, in turn, makes the intended emotional points in the show seem far less believable and they ultimately fall flat as a result.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, a predictable ending makes the watching the show a pointless exercise, as one could easily surmise how the show would end, many episodes in advance.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Afterword-\\n\r\nWell, if you actually took the time to read through this review, I thank you. If you agree with my review, please feel free to say so. Likewise, if you happen to disagree with my review or have any advice which could help me improve upon my next review, please leave some feedback on my MAL or Crunchyroll profile page, depending on which website you are reading this on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\r\nPlease take the time to read the review. I refuse to summarise this review for those of you who are not willing to read through it in the first instance, or at the very least, skim through it.",

Not only was I pleased to see not one but more beautiful girls but from most of the series in my list this was amongst the ones I enjoyed the most. \"Why is that?\" you would ask yourself. Well it's like this: from my point of view, the lucky bastard, Eita inevitably draws around these girls due to the fact that he is nice. He desperately tries to make them disappear but they end up in a pinch and herushes over to help them thus deepening their bond with him.It makes me ask myself after watching similar series: \"Why do they always get the good ones?\"\\n\r\nNow, from Eita's perspective, a bunch of troublesome girls begin to pester him and he doesn't know why.He asks himself :\"How did I get stuck in this mess?\"\\n\\n\r\nThe Story itself is very enjoyable especially when it leads to open conflicts and for some reason it kept me happy while waiting for new episodes.\\n\r\nSo if you feel like  watching it I recommend it with warmth.",

            "content": "Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru, or My Girlfriend and Childhood Friend Fight too much, is pretty much what the name says. This show is a harem. However, I found it quite different from a lot of other harems.\r\nStory - 7/10:\r\nOkay, so this show is a romantic comedy/harem. Usually, I tend to try and avoid romantic comedy, because they all have kind of a similar theme or story. This show was not an exception, though there were a few aspects that I did like and stood out to me. I have not seen a show where the main character is AGAINST love. Thisis because of family reasons. Typically in a harem, the guy either doesn't care, or wants a harem, like Issei from Highschool DxD. But the main character here doesn't, which just made the story funnier. However, I understand the he is against love, but sometimes, he's just oblivious. Enough said about that. So we have a typical harem plot: mysterious girl appears and likes guy and has to fight with his childhood friend along with other girls, to get the guy. Nothing we haven't seen, right? Although some parts of the plot are nothing new, I found the whole \"Burning Fighting Fighter\" thing a funny twist, and I believe that Masuzu using the notebook to blackmail him was a new element that I hadn't seen. I'll talk more about the character later though. I gave that story a 7/10, because while some of this was nothing new, Oreshura managed to bring some new and unique elements into the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10:\\n\r\nThis show had very nice artwork. I really liked the style, and the bright colors matched the mood of the show well. Some people might not like it, or think it's silly, but I thought the art fit the show perfectly. The character design was nice, and they were easily distinguishable.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10:\\n\r\nThe sound for this show I believe served its purpose. I found that the OP and ED, Girlish Lover and Wonder Tale, fit the mood of the show perfectly, and were nice to watch. It was like a treat at the beginning and end of each episode. Not to mention the songs were catching, and it was nice to hear all of the main female cast sing in the full version of the OP. That said, there were times when music could have been better, like in the more dramatic parts of the show. Overall, the sound was enjoyable, and fit the show well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10:\\n\r\nOreshura had an interesting set of characters that made the show what it is. Eita is a high school boy who is against love for family reasons. Masuzu is a mysterious and beautiful transfer student who sits by Eita. Chiwa is Eita's childhood friend. Himeka is a girl who claims to know him in her previous life. Ai is a tsundere who has a crush on Eita. What do these characters have in common? They all have fellings for Eita. Chiwa has a great reason which I will not spoil. Himeka believes she was his princess in her past life. Ai also have a good reason that I will not spoil. Masuzu blackmails Eita into being her \"boyfriend\" so guys will stop asking her out, but grows to have feelings for him. The characters are not really unique, but nevertheless, fun to watch. It was nice to see all the characters progress and develop. What I found really great, was that there were times throughout the show when I was rooting for each of the girls, and it felt like they all had an equal chance at being with Eita. Although the rivalry was mainly between Masuzu and Chiwa, the girls all had a fair chance at times, and progressed equally.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10:\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this show, and it remains one of my favorites. It was very funny, and fun to watch. If you want a more serious, intense show, I would stay away, but if you want something fun and lighthearted, Oreshura might be for you. I enjoyed watching his girlfriend and childhood friend fight too much, and I believe the show did what it was supposed to: to entertain.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nI give Oreshura a 8/10. The story is good, the art fits the show great, the sound was nice, the characters were decent, and the show was enjoyable! I recommend this show and am hoping for a second season.",

Hate reading overly lengthy reviews and going through every unnecessary point as some of the reviewers do, so expect this one to be short (Ironically, didn't turn out to be so short.)\r\nScrolling through the other reviews left me wondering.\r\nAm I seriously the only one who thought this was such a wtf anime?\r\nSo, I loved the beginning, it sparked a great interest for me to see the rest of the anime and I liked the first half.\r\nThen the seventh episode came along andthings started getting... I don't even know how to describe it. I can't emphasize how weird and nonsensical the show started turning real fast..\\n\\n\r\nThe new girl, Himeka was introduced, there she was for one episode and was never noticable again. Literally one episode was all she got. She feels so unimportant, volumed down and received so much less screen time than the other three it makes me wonder why they even introduced her to the show. Hence, it was actually a fight between the other girls. \\n\\n\r\n*Minor spoilers*\\n\r\nThe two girls introduced at start, Chiwa and Masuzu, were going at each other in first half of the anime, then Ai came along and story mostly focused between the relationship between her and MC, main lead across 7-10 eps.\\n\r\nNow, that part about her crying when he promised her to heal her back injury wasn't even touched upon until practically the end and after going through the second half of the anime it felt so incredibly out of place\\n\r\nIn fact, everything that happened in first part felt like that, as if it was all forgotten.\\n\r\nThe pretending part was something I had completely forgotten about throughout the second part, as well as some other things I won't bring up since I already spoiled enough.* *\\n\\n\r\nThe last three episodes were so painfully uncomfortable and awkward for me to watch and enjoy. The relationship between the characters was so unclearly shown to me I couldn't even tell to which point did he come to with each individual girl.\\n\r\nYou know that feel when you watch a typical harem and you know which one is going to be picked, which ones are just extras and which ones will get the short end of stick? Yeah, nothing of sort is even remotely apparent here, except for the completely discriminated one I mentioned before, himeka.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I'm being crazy and stupid.

And how it leaves the mind lingering in a positive way.\r\nIt is what it is guys. I cannot say much any further. Honestly what'd you expect from this anime, is what you are going to expect. BUT, It's really funny. It's so funny that it is worth watching. Not all the characters are funny, and you can expect the sweet love and harem from this. But it's something that gets you laughing,and gives you that feeling inside. I do like the outcome though. I won't say any spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\r\nEita Kido, a bookworm that aims to attend a medical school. He'd do anything. He'd even shun anything that has to do with romance and love. Masuzu Natsukawa, foreign and popular with guys. Who just happens to return from another country and was assigned a seat next to Kido. After a few days, Masuzu confessed to him in class, and blackmailed him after school on becoming her \"fake\" boyfriend so guys would stop asking her out. As time goes by for these two. Love only comes to one person.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nEita Kido, your main character. The smart guy that places at the top of school exams. Even though he's smart. He has these delusions and fantasies of addressing himself as \"Burning Fighting Fire\". A guy who win girls hearts, and battle monsters. After his childhood friend, Chiwa Harusaki's accident. He has to abandon his delusions. But his delusions still come out when things get too emotional. Oh, and obviously he cares for others and he's a nice guy. But you should expect that.\\n\\n\r\nChiwa Harusaki, childhood friend of Eita Kido. Also, a tomboy type. She used to be in the Kendo Club when she was little. Due to an injury from a car accident before high school, she has to quit. She's the closest one to Eita, out of all the other girls. Because she lives next to him, and loves Eita. It's a harem, just wanted to point it out their.\\n\\n\r\nMasuzu Natsukawa, Eita's \"girlfriend\". Spent most of her times overseas, and is considered the schools beauty. Confessed by many guys, and always shot them down. She used Eita's notebook, which has his \"fantasies\" to blackmail him. She might seem cruel, but truthfully she turns out to have a nice spot as the time goes by. \\n\\n\r\nHimeka Akishino, she has a one-sided crush on him. She also has some \"fantasies\" and \"delusions\" just like Eita. Since she comes in later. I'm not going to say much about her.\\n\\n\r\nAi Fuyuumi, to be blunt. She's Eita's \"fiancee\". She does come in late in the series. But she's really funny.\\n\\n\r\nKaoru Asoi, Eita's classmate and best friend. Who sat close to him until the seat change. I'll say this much, that I was surprised.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nIt's honestly one of the best anime I've seen that can keep my face smiling the whole time. I laughed a lot too. It's a simple Harem, romcom type deal. But it balances out. I would recommend it, and actually re-watch it with one of my friends. It's that funny guys, give it a shot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Thanks for reading (sorry for terrible typing, sensor sucks)\r\nAlright,  Im not in the best condittion to write a review, considering I smashed my computer and using a phone but I really want to change the negative view cast on this show thus far.\r\nPlease try not to mind typos cuz error seeking sucks\r\n- So I just began episode 7 confused cuz I totally forgot what happened last week. Ever fhave that happen to you? so I basically reviewed the last feww episodes and kinda getit better. Point? Ep 6 - 7, watch out:P\\n\\n\r\nAnyways to the main section. Ill condense my whole review into this single section. \\n\\n\r\nTis is twery fun to view, enjoyable and a nice watch. Sure, you may dislike a few heroines or two but with all of them, one is ought to flow your boat (a few lolis, tsundere etc.)\\n\\n\r\nThe art, music and animation are near perfect in my opinion. At the very least it does not hinder with the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are nice, with many different kinds so you will like a few and maybe dislike a few. Even so, some are just so adorable you can forgive the ones you dislike.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory, is mostly comedy, with  a few jojo references that I have no clue what it means (better get to watch jojo) but it is few and does not hinder the enjoyability.\\n\\n\r\nRating-9\\n\\n\r\nWhy? I watch it whenever it is released, no  questions asked and it cheers me up. Nice and good in almost every aspect and nothinng so harsh to make you go, crap lets hold it off, for like a year? (almost missed watching to aru majustu after touma got hit with the feather)\\n\\n\r\nMessage: WATCH OR AT LEAST TRY, mostly shounen tho. I have no clue how a girl would view this show but if you like harems, comedy, and multiple heroines, give it a shot. You have nothing to lose but a ton of joy to be gained from watching is terrific show\\n",

            "content": "(This is my opinion and this review **MIGHT CONTAIN LIGHT SPOILERS**)\r\nOverall score - 7/10\r\n\tThe anime overall uses has an uninteresting story and relies on cringe-based humor to keep the anime interesting. The characters were generic and not interesting. The sound and art was solid overall, no huge mistakes in animation was made either. It is a light hearted anime, so don't watch it if you are expecting a tear jerker.\r\nStory(6/10)- The story overall is a generic school harem with the main character being an overall average guy with the girls being a childhood friend, a shy girl, a demanding girl, etc. There is not muchmaking this anime different than others in the core aspects besides the fact that one of the girls pretends to be from the protagonist's past life which the protagonist made up when he was in middle school. The main protagonist is trying to hide his embarrassing past so he would not be seen as a chuunibyou that is where some of the cringe- humor comes into play. Besides the cringe-humor, there is nothing else that is really funny in this anime. The ending is both unexpected and disappointing at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5/10)- Like I said before, this anime has uninteresting characters. The main protagonist Eita is an average guy (for the most part) and he can't choose a girl he wants to be with, even though all of them would pretty much go to the semi-extreme to get him to like them. He knows that they like him, but, he is indecisive and that is another way this anime is not unique to other harems. Eita overall is uninteresting. The only interesting part about him is his relationship with his parent (which is skimmed over briefly which is a wasted opportunity) and his fantasies (which is highly over-used to a point where you don't care anymore). The main heroine Natsukawa is a popular girl that every guy had a crush on. She chooses the main protagonist because they are both \"anti-love\", meaning that they both despise love, which is ironic since they both of them start to make a liking for each other. You end up not liking Natsukawa as the anime goes on because she plots her plans to meddle with other peoples' lives and they show very little romantic angles with her and the protagonist. There are some romantic angles to remind the audience that she can still end up with the main protagonist. The childhood friend character Chiwa is the run-off-the-mill childhood friend who lives next to the protagonist and she knows \"everything\" about him. She had a big impact on how the main protagonist turned into how he is now in the anime as shown by the scenes from the past. But, it is too obvious that she likes him. It is painful to watch her try to get him to like her since it is very cringy. She stops relationships from forming with other girls from the anime which makes you dislike her as well. She tries to squeeze her way into the main protagonists's heart and that is what makes me dislike her.  Himeka is the shy girl that is EXTREMELY uninteresting.  She is just there in the anime. There is no point in her being there. The only thing she has going for her is her fantasizing with the main protagonist. Then we come to Ai, probably the only character who I really like in this anime. She is quirky in a good way. Her awkwardness just makes you want to love her. The way she tries to get close to the main protagonist and how the main protagonist's best friend helps her out plan out their next move makes her a likable character.  She actually attempts to hide her crush with the main protagonist unlike the other girls. She is the most likeable out of the bunch because of the way she reacts to the main protagonist. But, she ruins her own character by being over aggressive.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Art (8/10)- The music and art in the anime overall is solid. The music came at the right times and the art was average to say the least. There were no obvious mistakes in animation when it came to the finished product. The music is not unique or interesting however. For me, music in anime is absolutely essential. If the music is good, it could give that anime a few extra points. However, the background music was nothing to write home about. It was completely average. The opening is very annoying and predictable. They had the main heroines sing and it was overall annoying. I would skip the opening every time because of how annoying it is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment (7/10- Skippable)- It was an average anime to say the least. There is really nothing that I think separates it from other harems. You can pretty much watch another harem to get your harem fix if needed. But, it is not horrible. Overall it is a light hearted anime that you can watch to the side since it is a short series. I would recommend this anime for anyone needing a harem fix or a light hearted anime, but it is skippable.\\n\\n\r\n*Im not a huge fan of harems overall, so my opinion may be different from someone who adores harems.\\n",

            "content": "Anime storytelling lives and breathes within its own special world.  The better anime series radiate energy, creativity and professionalism: they may draw from many special anime \"worlds\" or genres while still appealing on several levels that transcend the limits of genre.  Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru, or Oreshura for short, certainly strikes a chord with me  (even tho its tagged as a Harem/Romantic Comedy anime).  The staff prove themselves keenly observant and talented, and can deliver the goods in story, voice, art, music, and production.\r\nI tend to let an anime reveal its story at its own pace, butbeyond its romantic comedy category, I found Oreshura to quickly establish its thing: playing with cultural tropes and interpersonal relationships.  The male protagonist Kidou Eita is depicted as a post-chuunibyou highschooler who is bent upon his studies, not all the \"love on the brain\" high school life he sees around himself.  Nevertheless he's helplessly swept into the romantic plans of several girls around him; the girls even form a high school club named Society Advocating Maidenly Excellence For All Girls, and a skeleton in his chuunibyou closet past is a key to dragging Kidou along.\\n\\n\r\nOreshura can pop surprises: Eita's aunt Saeko, a writer/creator at a gaming company, triggers the concluding story sequences by enrolling the girls in her company's publicity-event contest.  But throughout, this anime's strong points are its agility in turning up amusing displays of cultural awareness, its attractive artwork and color palette, and storyline flow.  Oreshura: charming and engaging.",

The strory felt plausible to me, like i could be that main protagonist who got asked by the most popular girl simply because he doesnt like love. Art was nice,but since im not an artist,i cant comment. Sound is technical and needs a certain set of skills to ruin that. Characters werent unique,atleast most of them werent, Masuzu was a rarer character,someone who doesnt like love,is bored by it and so chooses to pretend to date another person. Her apearancewasnt as unique,but like most other places was simply to say \"Spot the main protagonist\".",

            "content": "Opening Summary\r\nThere are many different harem anime, and many of them tend to be very similar (if not identical) to each other. In some ways, OreShura is no different than those. But with a great cast of characters and somewhat unique scenario, it manages to stand out, at least a little bit. For the sake of my own sanity, I'm gonna divide this review into 6 sections: Story, Art, Sound, Characters, My Enjoyment, and My Overall opinion of the anime. I'll make sure to keep it spoiler free. I'd just like to point out that these are my opinions and mine alone, so feel freeto disagree. With that aside, let's begin.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThe story is essentially your typical harem affair: An extremely dense main character (Eita) is starting high school with his childhood friend who harbors feelings for him (Chiwa), then suddenly a new, stereotypical, foreign, rich, school beauty appears (Masuzu) and decides the MC is going to be her boyfriend (but not really). Add in the delusional but devoted to the MC 8th grade syndrome girl who believes the two were lovers in a past life (Himeka), and his childhood fiance who he met before his childhood friend that manages to continue harboring feelings for him (Ai) and you have the pieces of a generic harem anime. While the plot is predictable and bland in many respects, the latter parts manage to be at least a bit unique with a few twists and it should be enough to keep you watching. Of note though is the somewhat iffy pacing, with one of the girls being first introduced more than halfway through the 13 episodes. It could have been laid out better or more efficiently if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has a very pleasant art style in my opinion, very colorful and vibrant with animations of faces and characters appearing smooth and well-detailed up close. Some of the background characters and art feels lazy by comparison, but it's not awful or something that would completely take you out of it by any means.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes for the anime are \"Girlish Lover\" by all the female lead's voice actresses, and \"W:Wonder Tale\" by Masuzu's voice actress, Yukari Tamura. Both are fairly pleasant pieces and fit the feel of the anime, even if the former is a bit childish. The anime's OST is decent as well, with nothing in particular standing out, but the songs that blend so perfectly in the background doing just enough to keep it flowing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nNow this is where someone could argue that OreShura shines. The cast of girls is one of the stronger you'll find in any harem, from the hopelessly law-abiding and marriage-obsessed Ai to the straight-faced and childish but terribly entertaining Himeka. Despite conforming to stereotypes of anime and manga of the same genre, the characters feel real and believable, with their dialogue going smooth and life-like, and their personalities being decent enough to feel compassionate towards them when the show calls for it. I especially liked Himeka and Chiwa's characters quite a bit, with both being great performances that can make you grow quite attached to them. Eita's character felt like a weak point (by comparison anyway), but then \\n\r\nagain, many harem MCs seem to be.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nSure, it was far from perfect. And some of the moments did make me cringe and shake my head, but it was an overall great ride. I can honestly say I wasn't bored once watching this anime. I was always waiting to see what happened next or how certain events would turn out. There were quite a few laughs too, even a bit of emotion (not nearly enough to induce tears if that's what you're looking for, sorry). Definitely an entertaining ride.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nWhile the anime lacks in its story and doesn't wow you with its soundtrack, its lovable cast of characters and entertaining (if a bit cliche) moments should help you trudge through it. Definitely not a \"MUST SEE OMG BEST ANIMU EVAR\" type show, but if you're looking for a decent harem with a likable cast, you could definitely do worse. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "ORESHURA REVIEW:\r\nMINDSET:\r\nA point five better than Your Generic Harem.\r\nSYNOPSIS:\r\nImagine Your typical harem plot: Male lead starts of living next with one chick who is the childhood friend. (do You know where this is going?) Then one day, he finds another semi-woman, who has majestically gushing silver hair, walking, she gallants over the empty battlefield of barrenity and storms of darkness, blinding her eyes of inner-cold heartedness... She finds, a regular guy, and procives... to play with he's mind like a playful whore, as she pretended to be he's girlfriend. If he tries to break up, she will give out he's note book to the restof the school, embarrassing the heck out of him! (and basically black mailing him) So, yes, Harem happens. (obvious fact)\\n\\n\r\nREVIEW:\\n\r\nLet's be real everyone, the whole show is pretty much a Harem all the way through, we have the childhood friend, the generic woman hoarding protagonist, the quiet girl, and the obvious love interest, tsundere, etc... Its also a \u201cLight Novel Adaptation\u201d which means it has a 95% to be turdful. However, this is the same case, but slightly better. Why it can only be summed up within two words: \u201cNatsukawa Misuzu\u201d Because:\\n\r\n Her character design is really beautiful. Period.\\n\r\n She's the very feisty type as she can be playing with the protagonists mind as she loves teasing him all through out the show.\\n\r\nShe actually develops, into a very sweet character, but still keeps the feistiness which I like.\\n\r\nMost of the time, she always seemed very happy and playful with this enjoyable aura.\\n\r\nYou just got to lover her personality.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Yes, she does have her emotional moments, and because of how well written she is, they actually work. However, for the rest of the cast; they are all Your completely generic archetypes used for like the seven millionth time! As they could not catch up with Misuzu's greatness, they are characters that I just can't take seriously as one of  the repeated formula for Harems these are far too overused. The story feels like a complete Harem, and You can pretty much predict whose girl is going to jump on the Woman Hoarding Lead's bed after the first episode. There are also JoJo refrences. Like, the author really loves JoJo, and he/she written Misuzu as a fangirl of JoJo, with some moment even stating flat out that this is JoJo refrence at some points in there interactions.\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, Oreshura is Your completely 95% run of the mil harem. Why 95%? Misuzu, You will only watch this show for Misuzu if You do not enjoy the exact same repeated formula over and over again. Without her, this review would'nt even exist, as the show will only exist as one of the masses amount of generic Harems being released in Japan. I know I can't make my review as detailed as I wanted it to be, but its a Harem made in 21st century Japan, so what do You expect for such cheap writing?\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation, is more colourful than Your average work it is very bright and not so serious blending very well with the whole show. The character designs look a little different, yet refreshing unlike big bouncy juggernauts, with a darker colour scheme. It does the job in a slightly better manner.\\n\r\nMusic however, is nothing to talk about, it just fits the mood, and that\u2019s all what it does. And the opening can also jump right in to be on par with the shows OST.\\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nFor some reason, this is one of the more obscure Harems I've noticed. Not as if anyone would care that this show exists, but for what its worth, people will only watch this show for Misuzu, even after 10 decades.\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\n3/10 - 100% generic Harem plot all the way through.\\n\r\n3.5/10 \u2013 As added 0.5 points for Misuzu alone.\\n\r\n6.5/10 \u2013 For bright Animation and some really nice designs that sets itself apart from a completely generic Harem. \\n\r\n4/10 - A completely forgettable OST, that gets the job done, without anything kind of noteworthy.\\n\r\n4/10 \u2013 As Misuzu is the only character who will be entertaining You in a boring Harem.\\n\\n\r\nFINALE: 4.5/10 \u2013 For Masuzu. (only added a 0.5 to the generic Harem score)e XXX.",

And at first it seemed like a love triangle anime, and it was what first 4 episodes were about. And they were really really great! Then after that, with introductions of other girls, quality fell off. Some silly things started happening. It wasn't terrible but it was a sharp contrast to how great first arc was. But then when things settled into place, it just keeps getting better all the way to the end, and ends up surpassing the first arc. \r\nIt has great characters, with actual development(at least some of them). It's cute and funny, it has a distinct visual style that was pulled off well. It has high production quality. Great OP/ED. Great voice acting. But where it really shines among other anime, is that in the second half it takes itself seriously. It actually takes a bite at the harem genre and freaking deals with it! And deals with it well. Not in the School Days kind of way, but second closest thing to seriousness. \\n\\n\r\nThe whole harem setting is set up in an impressively believable way. The character dynamics just work. Though some of its tropes are stuff we've been seeing a lot lately in the genre, so I wouldn't say it's a deconstruction of the genre, but it the next best thing.  I'd say this is the best harem anime. The only ones in league with it are Haganai and Korezom, but for completely different reasons. Haganai is incomplete so it cannot be fairly compared yet. And KoreZom is a parody full of craziness. And School Days is a full on deconstruction.\\n\\n\r\nMayo Chiki is generic traditional harem done right. In comparison to that, Oreshura is not something I'd classify as generic harem. It's a step above that. It's a great romcom that happens to tell a story that falls into a harem genre. But it goes so far and beyond in seriousness, quality writing and actual romance that it's a step above Mayo Chiki. But note that it is different from it, it even has no blunt fanservice. Fanservice is in the league with Sakurasou or Haganai, and maybe even tamer.",

Why 6? Well, the plot of this anime is not that original not to say an abused type of plot where an ordinary kind guy, works hard and therefore starts to build up relationships and in the process gaining harem. He gains his harem by starting a club which is a bit common to high school flicks these days.His harem includes achildhood friend, a popular girl with a dilemma and etc.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Rating 9. In my opinion the animation is one of the best this season especially at episode 1 where the guy wore a knight outfit.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Rating 7. Only seven because there's a point where you'll get bored and will want to skip certain scenes. It is also predictable so you won't be excited upon seeing the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound. Rating 9. Listen to the opening theme and that will explain to you why 9. The BGMs are also quite cool.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah. Overall. It is a 7. I have seen a lot of anime of this type, and they did better than this anime, so maybe that affected my ratings.",

I was kind of confused, I was wondering whether or not Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru would get a second season. When I found out that it didn't, I was kind of disappointed, as at the end of Ep 13 there were still many unsolved plot threads that needed solving. Even early episode plot threads did not get answered in Ep 13, well sort of. Though overall it's not that big of a problem and does not affect the scoring in big ways.\r\nAnother Issue I had with themain plot was that it lost its original goal. Being anti-love, I was expecting the main male lead to hate love for the majority of the episodes, but I guess my theories were wrong. It just turned into a classic harem story.\\n\\n\r\nThough that's not to say that this anime is bad, I definitely enjoyed it. The art and animation were well done and the sound for the anime was pretty good and on sync with the animation. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that bothered me were the characters. As listed above I, I felt that some of the characters had lost their main personality trait and became cliche anime characters. This does not say that all characters are bad. I just believed that some of the characters weren't themselves from time to time in the later episode. \\n\\n\r\nTo wrap this up, I believe that the overall score for this anime is a 6/10 and it is definitely enjoyable. Even though I would say that this is not for everyone.",

Don't bother with the rest.\r\nLooking back on it, this show was nothing more than 1 actual episode and the rest is cliche along with fillers.\r\nThe only episodes worth watching are first and that mostly just the first half, that's what made the show interesting. If you wanna see the direction the show takes, watch until episode 3. That's a -dead end-(don't quote me on that). \r\nRest of the show is your common romantic comedy(as casual as it gets, like your TV movies/shows. It's like watching Titanic for the 27th time). I likedhow it started, it was quite smart and human for characters to start off like that. Neither we're too confident or too stupid and they acted in a manner that made it good. Then, there's the rest of the show.. How his girlfriend went from \"same as you\" to \"madly in love\", \"a bitch\", and also \"the devil\". His childhood friend went from a good friend to a chiwawa that screams all day and acts so tsundere it's unbearing. Saw this show many times before. Saw it done better. Saw better comedy and episodes which order would matter, but here not; \\n\r\nMC went from uninterested to \"oblivious/dull\" and he gets criticized for it; So much screaming in this show!! I'm not having my volume at 100 yet I can hear her from the other room, good thing I didn't watch it on TV. It went like a rollercoaster, from kinda good to absolutely ignorant. Eventually get got all boring.\\n\r\n(What do you do when you have no more imagination or things to do with your current characters? Add more characters! - Japanese anime/manga creators.)\\n\r\n I liked the style of the Art though (so bright sometimes), but some faces made me laugh like their eyes we're dark dots that moved sideways while zooming in. Other times, they forgot what was the art supposed to look like.",

            "content": "If you asked me what not to do in a harem anime, I would recommend Oreshura for you. Seriously.\r\nThe biggest reason why harem anime has come into existence is probably because of the audience being comprised of people who want to have their dreams of having all the girls in the world chase after them fulfilled. Which is cool and all, cause without them, harem anime won't exist. However, with that dream fulfillment, you have a great compromise in quality. \r\nWith Oreshura though, the anime just digs itself deeper. The harem just becomes so unrealistic that it is impossible to see the absurdities this animewould go to. I cannot comment on them without going into spoilers. Sorry.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing I hated about the anime was the Jojo references. I didn't know what they were before the anime, and I still don't have any idea of what they are after the anime, but I hated them because of this anime. To cite  a point, a girl kisses a guy and then tells him that the kiss was a Jojo's reference. WHATTTTTT?????\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing was the so called notebook. The white girl just tries to blackmail the guy with a notebook that he wrote during his chuunibyou years, and keeps reading it aloud in front of everyone while the guy desperately pleads her not to do that. Which is fine, except how come no one in the anime gets the point that the notebook is the guy's notebook in reality? And the white haired girl keeps threatening to blackmail the guy with it for the entire anime, and the guy complies like a dog. How in the hell is that possible? \\n\\n\r\nThe last is the complete ass pull at the end of the anime. I won't tell you what it is, but the anime ends in the most ridiculous way possible. Hint: The guy chooses a girl and the rest of the girls still don't break up. No points for guessing who that girl is.\\n\\n\r\nJust don't watch this. Just don't. Cause I can guarantee you, To Love-Ru is better than this one. FAR BETTER.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

She might be hard to bear at first but she gets better over time so dont worry about it. This show has some really funny parts and the girls are just all adorable. There's all your basic girl typesso you should have no problem picking a girl.  Masuzu is your cold and cool type who has her family and life problems and she hates love. Ai is your hall monitor who is a hardcore tsundere. Chiwa is your loli childhood friend who's the jealous type and she loves meat and kendo. And lastly Himeka is a delusional cute girl who lives life like its some kinda Rpg game. Eita goes great with all of them but I chose Chiwa since Loli childhood friends are the best. Lol.

I could barely watch without having a smile on my face, cringing in a good way or just outright laughing. Fine story and very much enjoyable!\r\nArt: It's a very bright anime. It's colourful but not in a way that's a turn off, on the contrary it's probably one of the things I like most about it besides how the faces are drawn. If anyone reads this and watches Ore no Kanojo, tell me this: Did it at all remind you of the Monogatari seriesby how the drawings were done?\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice actors do a good job of being funny and over the top at times. The music's enjoyable especially during funny or awkward scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: As a protagonist, Eita does well in maintaining the classic oblivious male friend to a group of girls. What's better is the story behind him, going from a low graded student to the top of his class for something very important to him. Even though he's a weak protagonist (Duh) he's a very likeable one.\\n\\n\r\nOf the four main female characters, I found A-Chan and The President to be the most likeable and funny. A-Chan because she has a Tsun-dere personality that's nearly openly two faced in some scenes, and President because of how manipulative and bitchy she can come off. \\n\\n\r\nThank you very  much for reading my review, I hope you read reviews I've made for other anime as well.

Nothing really interesting, nor real development, but it isn't terrible. You can't really screw up a story if you don't make one. \r\nThe art and sound is alright, it really doesn't do anything in particular, nor does it stand out at all, but it does the job just right.\r\nThe characters are horrendous in my opinion. I can forgive our main character, considering the fact that most main characters in a harem aresupposed to be an emotionless blank slate, for the viewers to relate to. Yet all of the 'romantic' interests are characters which in my opinion are extremely generic, and poorly executed. They are not likeable at all, making it very frustrating to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy was bearable, with some okay jokes here and there, but ultimately a mediocre anime, only really recommendable to people who absolutely love harem.

There's something amusing in watching a man be blackmailed by a cold hearted psycho just because he doesn't have the balls to say : \"You know what, fuck you and that notebook. I'm just gonna walk away.\"\\n\\n\r\nArt is fairly good. Trees and shit are animated nicely . Top points here. Sound was good too. Skipped the opening and ending songs. \\n\\n\r\nYeah no, walk the fuck away from this one. Unless you like stories about psychos.",

But is forced against his own will to be the boyfriend of the prettiest girl in school, Masuzu.\r\nFirst of all, this anime has a really good art quality and one of the best I've seen. Which adds to the affect of the girls' facial expressions when talking to the main character who 3 of the main 3 girls love.\r\nThe story involves with the protagonist Eita whose previous life, Burning Fighter Fighter, iswritten in a book which is at first used to blackmail him into a fake relationship. This creates some weird and wacky comedic scenes when the book is read out loud that add to his character as the anime progresses. Eita's fake girlfriend Masuzu also shuns anything to do with love and only gets Eita to be her boyfriend because of the boys in her school asking her out over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nThe love rivals Himeka, Ai and Chiwa all compete to win Eita's heart. Trying to do so with their different personalities and ideas. So this creates a tense atmosphere towards Eita's girlfriend Masuzu.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime provides some fun. Although it might not be for everyone you should at least give it a try.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I feel that I should give my two cents about this anime, as many seem to be massively bashing it.\r\nThis show will not break any walls that haven't been already broken. It's a harem rom-com with nothing massively revolutionary about it. HOWEVER, the way in which this show does this genre is probably the best of its kind.\r\nYou've probably already read the synopsis about this anime, so I don't need to go into great depths. It follows a guy who rejected all forms of love due to love leading to his parents leaving him, living alone. One day he sits next to the most populargirl in the school, who gets asked out nearly every day. One day she approaches him and asks him out. On the way home, she explains that she has the same thoughts about love as him and they become fake partners. However, his childhood friend also has a crush on him, and she tries to cover it by claiming that she just wants to be \"popular\". So the fake girlfriend sets up a club for women who want to remake themselves and become popular. BUT WAIT, more people become involved in the harem, until it's an awkward 4 way harem, with each member being involved in the club.\\n\\n\r\nI tried to make it as non spoilery as possible, hence the crappy description, however each character involved and not involved in the harem are done extremely well, and you feel like you know exactly why each of them are in love with the main character.\\n\\n\r\nWithout giving any spoilers, the last episode is done brilliantly well, with a very bitter-sweet ending.\\n\\n\r\nI'd easily recommend this to someone who likes the genre.",

            "content": "I was reluctant to watch oreshura because the whole harem rom-com is so commonly done. The first few episodes were interesting, then it got redundant, and then it got better. \r\nStory: 7/10 the plot of the show is pretty obvious: the girlfriend and childhood friend fight over the MC. Then they introduce two characters, one of which thinks they were lovers in a past life and another that was a childhood friend as well. It's your general harem, nothing new. The only difference would be the situation between the MC and his girlfriend. But it was executed rather well, I'll give it that.\r\nArt: 9/10 Iactually really enjoyed the style of art! It's bubbly and light and really nice and easy to look at. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 the op and ed were catchy and one of the few I didn't skip over. Any insert osts matched the mood rather well. I don't really pay much attention to sound though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10 if the story stuck to the main two rivals and the MC, I would've given a 9.5 for characters. Eita doesn't know how to handle love, he's very honest to himself, he can logically think, etc. I fell in love with him too tbh. Chiwa, the childhood friend, is rather annoying at times. However, she has good reason to be in love with Eita, trust me. But, in my opinion, the saving grace would be the girlfriend, Masuzu. She's a total bitch, I won't deny that. Especially in the first few episodes. But once it starts showing more of how she really feels and her internal struggles, I was able to identify and sympathize with her more, making her the most complex character.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I can't ignore the delusional Hime and the tsundere Ai. Ai has to be one of the most annoying characters I've ever come across. Sure, she has her problems too but just no. And Hime who? We're barely told anything about her.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10 oreshura has laughs and feels, though more laughs. I would check how much time was left in each episode, showing how stretched out it was, but I always watched until the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 oreshura is great for anyone who likes harem and rom-coms! However, if you're looking for something super deredere, I wouldn't suggest it.",

It's one of those animes where the main protagonist isn't chancing love, but instead trying to fulfill another purpose even though it is an harem.\r\nStory: - 7/10 -\r\nThe story follows a highschool boy named Eita, who wants to do something with his life. He wants to be a doctor so he can pay back his aunt who is his current guardian and to help a childhood friend. Everything starts of like a normal slice of life series however, he is one day met by the most beautiful girl in school. Masuzu, who blackmails him by usinghis embarrassing notebook into being his boyfriend so the other boys can stop asking her out.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself isn't so bad and you may think it isn't unique but using blackmail for love is interesting and I like that because it's funny to see how things work out.\\n\\n\r\nArt: - 8/10 -\\n\r\nOf course, the art is amazing. This kind of art is used for anyone who has been down lately and want themselves to cheer up. The artwork that has been done in this anime is a job well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: -8/10-\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime is good. Depending on the mood of the scenario, each soundtrack hasn't failed to impress. Other sound effects in the background such as crickets or the waves of the ocean also create an immersive effect but it's not consistently heard throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: -8/10-\\n\r\nCharacters in this anime were very interesting as they all had their own unique personalities. Masuzu was the serious fake, A-Chan the tsundere love crazy type, Chiwa the annoying one (Literally) and Himeka the weird one. Each one of them have their own backstories on why they're in love with Eita and it's pretty interesting. Each character has a unique voice to reprsent who they are and I guess that really pulled me into the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: -9/10-\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime. I really liked how clean and refreshing it was and how It prevented itself from not copying other harems (Although some scenes were cliche). If a season 2 was going to come out, I would definitely watch it. The comedy in this show made me laugh a lot as it captured some really funny moments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: -8/10-\\n\r\nOverall I give this show a 8/10. I would have maybe gave it a 9 if the show didn't have so many obvious cliches. I wonder if they did 25 episodes instead of 13, it could have been interesting and it would make a much more impact on the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - Watch this anime if you've been down as it will lift your spirits up!\\n\r\nFeel free to add me.",

It's got the typical standard thing for any type of harem type anime.. Childhood friend? Rich girl? Strange and Quiet girl? Overly in love girl? All done and dusted! ALSO this is one of the most important things.. The main male lead is not a pussy and when he let's say kisses someone? He doesn't freak out like a little bitch and sky rockets himself into the sky like all the other anime series.. :D\r\nStory 8/10: Really enjoyed that they went throughthe entire series with the fake girlfriend thing and it ended the way it ended.. (even though chiwa shouldn't of kissed him.. ffs chiwa!!) I felt like it was a nice refreshing way to look a harem and see it develop into a nice new story I haven't seen yet. The story is typical and is still a nice watch if you're looking for a uptight bitchy girl who is trying to show her emotions and isn't doing such a good job at it as well.. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: These types of anime are my favorite and I basically only watch these types so..\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: Don't really care.. As long as it sounds good..\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: Really enjoyed the two main leads and how the went by the story line and didn't drop the boyfriend girlfriend act half way through or after one episode.. Really glad they made it this way around where the guy didn't get noticed and the girl noticed him and it was really refreshing to see these two characters develop their emotions like this instead of them being left out all the time. I'm also glad to see how each character really affected each others life and it came out for the best in the end. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: I really enjoyed how they made the two characters come together and how it ended up with everyone, apart from the kiss at the end Chiwa! Chiwa ya lil bitch... You had your chance and you wasted 9 years on it! ffs! I would highly recommend this to people if you're looking for a good harem type series where it will end in him choosing a girl... (I personally love these types of harems..) \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: As said I really enjoyed it and would highly recommend this series to others.",

Luckily, however, it didn't go down that path.\r\nThe story revolves around a guy who dislikes everything to do with love who gets trapped into a relationship by a girl with the same mindset. Then, add in a childhood friend, a chuunibyo with delusions of a past lover, and a promise of marriage, and you've got Oreshura. The plot lines were simple but well thought outin my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nThe art form added soft colours and excellent shading to bring a new 'light' to an anime that I haven't often seen. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were wonderfully thought out with underlying connections to the main character that ran way back. This led to obvious conflict, a lot of silly moments and a minor amount of drama, but not too much of any of these to make it less enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all, it's a great RomCom/Harem. 9/10",

            "content": "\"Someone who could stand being with a liar? I thought that would be obvious; it be her accomplice.\" -Mana Natsukawa\r\nI'd like to start out by saying that this review is going to be somewhat influenced by my own personal opinion, and I will also try to stray from revealing any spoilers about the plot.\r\nOre no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru (Whew, I'm going to refer to it as Oreshura) is in some ways (referring to the BEGINNING of Oreshura and the MC only) similar to the newly released Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. The MC differ in a few ways; levelof intelligence, home and family situation, and knowledge of what is going on around them. While Hikigaya Hachiman is witty and downright negative, Kidou Eita is determined, smart, and kind. The main similarity they share is how they got to where they are. They both were rejected by female peers, they both, through their anti-love attitudes end up forced into clubs and then proceed to be surrounded by women. This is however where the pair of anime begin to split. While Oregairu begins on a path to comedy and character presentation, straying from the romance and harem themes, Oreshura walks the path of a common harem romance anime with some tasteful fan service included.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: While evaluating characters I mainly look at their personality. In Oreshura I managed to find all of the common personalities in standard harem anime, with one exclusion of Masuzu Natsukawa. Regarding Masuzu, at the moment, I can't put a pin on what to tag her as, tsundere,tsun,dere, or downright weird with the personality changes she goes through. But like Masuzu, Eita, Hachiman, Yukino (from Oregairu) are similar in their anti-love antics. Of course in harem anime there is either one of the following personalities which I will represent through similar characters in other harem anime I have watched. There is the  Hikigaya Hachiman, there is Ichika Orimura, Rito Yuuki, and Tomoki Sakurai. In Oreshura, the main character, Eita Kidou most likely falls under the character of Ichika Orimura because of their similar personality of kindness to all and downright obliviousness to everything that goes on around them. The other characters including the main character harmonize well and show some character development mainly regarding the romance theme to Eita Kidou that contribute fairly to the plot. I won't say it was amazing, but their conversations between each other during their club meetings and activities made me laugh. Burning Fighting Fighter uses Black Flame! (XD You'll understand after watching). My favorite parts in this anime regarding the characters have to be the delusions each has. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: The opening and ending theme kind of reminded me of the To Love Ru series but I've never had to complain about the OST to an anime series before. The art wasn't sharp and amazing, but smooth and nice that didn't detract from the overall value. \\n\\n\r\nPlot: Well the plot wasn't too bad, I saw much originality in how each harem character was introduced into the main character's life, and the way their daily slice of life episodes went about were slightly different from what I have seen. Although the ending and beginning have to be common, since it IS a harem themed anime, the overall unending of harem themed anime cannot be seen elsewhere. The plot developed quite nicely, regarding the main characters interaction with each of the girls and providing some background information here and there that wasn't needed but when shown,but very appreciated later. At first in an episode I thought they were going to through in some Yaoi (which I just can't tolerate) I was like WOAH... But in both a negative and positive way I was relieved and disappointed. Introducing that minor theme would have been somewhat interesting to the harem anime since I've yet to see it, but as I stated above, I can't tolerate homosexuality. The story wasn't too cliche to the point where I was bored, but nicely presented in a comedic, romantic way. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this anime for mainly 2 reasons. The comedy it provided in the main characters delusions, and the romance between the main character and his kanojo. (I'm a romance nut). I would recommend this anime to anyone who has seen Oregairu, or into the harem/romance themed anime. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n\r\n-Nebarto",

            "content": "Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru (or Oreshura for short) is a Romantic Comedy Harem. I have actually read some of the manga which was somewhat interesting so go check that out too. I've written a review before which was more of a rant, but this one will be a little more stable. \r\nStory: Read the synopsis. The story itself is original but gives me a somewhat desire to have more. The storyline can actually have the potential to be much much more, but cuts short. At sometimes the emotions in the scenes were pretty powerful which definetly evoked some feelings from me.Like I said, with some really good quality it could have lifted off but doesnt. \\n\r\nThe comedy, in my opinion, is just horrendous. I never chuckled or even grinned to the supposed comedic scenes because the humor is just so childish and overused. Example: Our female character Masuzu tortures our male character Eita with a diary he has written from his past (unfortunately in the past this poor sap was dillusional with his retarded gimmick burning fighting fighter so he wrote everything in that characters perspective). The amount of times Masuzu reads out his entries is ridiculous and continues to persist throughout the episodes. \\n\r\nThe romance is where this show actually shines. We have a fake couple consisting of anti-love activists which only purpose is to drive away annoying confessions (for the girl of course, Eita is just an intelligent nerd). As indicated from the title, a childhood friend is now involved with the love triangle (will later develop into a love pentagon) and the scenario is actually pretty depressing. The osananajimi (meaning childhood friend if you didnt catch on) is now torn apart because the boy she has spent most of her time with is now with another girl. The only problem with this concept is actually....nothing really. The real problem is that the directing is so bland and uninteresting, it seems like the situation is watered down. The extra 2 characters is simply not necessary but that would destroy the purpose of the harem category of the anime. I personally dislike harems because the amount of time to develop each character is way too short and this generally applies to this show also.\\n\r\nThis is going to be around 7.5 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The animations are mediocre so don't expect intense angles/perspectives to excite your eyes. However I will say the character's design is good and the colors are vibrant. The brightness of the hue actually bothers my eyes, not because of the beauty, but because there are simply no deep tones which is not aesthetically pleasing. The character are drawn nicely and the appeal of each individual sticks out well. I would personally grade this department a 7 out of 10. One more thing should be noted. The ED is absolutely gorgeous and the music is fantastic so if anything check that out. This deserves a 7.5 out of ten. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Okay. No big surprise. The ED, however, has a great song and the emotional scenes are accompanied well with a sweet background music. 7 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Contrary to typical shitty harem animes (like Kono Naka), the characters are entertaining. Like i've stressed earlier the character development is lacking. The final member of the harem joins during episode 7 which only leaves 5 episodes left to develop a good background and a progression for the story at the same time. Aside from this issue the personalities are interesting and have much variety. Oreshura has the popular types of tropes: tsunderes and kuuderes with a nice blend of distinctive attributes. The seiyuu's are good, however i must complain that Masuzu is boring to listen too and Chiwa's seiyuu steals the show. I give this a 7 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Yea I can say this was pretty enjoyable. The interactions i see and the situations that are created are somewhat fun to watch. I have to say, that this show is not going to make you become enlightened or suddenly jumpstart emotions. You will not be missing much from deciding to ignore this anime, but I would recommend taking a little peek for romance fans. I say this is 7 out of 10 (could have been 8 out of 10 with some tweaks)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I don't know what to write here. do whatever you want\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"MY TRUE NAME IS BURNING FIGHTING FIGHTER!\" Eita Kidou \r\n           Wonderful...\r\nOre no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru or Oreshura for short is a RomCom Harem. Now before all you hating harems people go wild and object that very fact that i said that a RomCom and Harem can be of one genre, i say now, well, go away. I say this because as New anime come out this genre is become so very popular< Campoine, Nisekoi, Haganai, even Clannad at the start was a bit haremy, need i say more?\r\nAlot of by you maysay this genre is also not where anime quality is that high, as in rated highly, for they are bland. Well i agree to some extend, \\n\r\nHOWEVER karma, i believe that anime quality should not be based on genre, and this anime can fully support me on that one.\\n\\n\r\nOreshura on that outside is seen as a RomCom Harem with the average cardboard cut outs we see in every anime, But if you were actually not hating you can see that was the point of this anime. Confused ? Lets explore \\n\\n\r\nStory - I did say that this was a anime where we see cardboard cut out at its finest and it was a RomCom Harem, so if your like me and watch lots of these animes because well, why not? there awesome, you can get a idea. A non popular , smart guy meets the most beautiful girl in the school and now she falls in \"love\" with him. \"love\" as in a FAKE relationship to ward off pest of men who wants the affection of a beautiful woman, Brilliant twist to spice a for seeming cupboard anime. Do mind i say i love this twist, just because how the story will potray how she gradually falls for the mc as her situation reflects he self being. Girls, they have it so hard, i wish i was wanted \\n\\n\r\nArt - Colourful and bright what more can you ask for? I'm a sucker for bright things colours. Now the animation itself was meh average i guess, but the burning fighting fighter scenes would draw these wierd pictures really help me see how delusion this kid was bad in the day. He was like Christmas in the summer! Over all the art could be bland at times but it did well in other times.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Now the sound. Alot of the time in my anime i don't really pay attention to music but i do try. This anime's op was not really that great average i guess, i would just skip it. The sound of the anime itself i found well i didnt find it. The bgm would be overplayed by the voices of the characters so i dont have much to say. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - Now the characters, where do i begin. Allow me do this in our terms.  We have the wonderful\\n\r\n~ Tsundere 1 Chiwa - Childhood friend with more dere - love with mc\\n\r\n~ Deredere Himeka - Previous life lover?!? guess what also in love mc\\n\r\n~ Tsundere 2 Ai - Childhood friend also with more tsun - in love with mc\\n\r\n~ Kuudere Masuzu - Current \"girlfriend\" hmmm She Will be i love with mc\\n\\n\r\nAmazing, so many cut outs! Well for all you people who dont know, this anime is to highlight these cut outs and make them there finest cut out there can be. Even though i have seen many traits of these in other animes, this anime just makes it revolutionary. Now i know some fans may feel there the same as any heroine but this just how i see it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I really enjoy a variety of RomComs and Harems and this brought a satisfying watch and good anime to my collection. I didnt change any thing on RomComs more like a renew on what a good romcom should be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Overall i think that if your like me and you want to enjoy a normal romcom with a twist then i highly recommend you watch this. However if you are bored of the heroine cut outs and want to find something new then this really isn't the anime for you.\\n\\n\r\n  ~ Neonapplee",

            "content": "I've just watched this anime a few days ago. I still consider myself an amateur to the whole anime scene, so take my words with a grain of salt.\r\n7/10 story.\r\nStorywise it isn't too bad. The plot was well established, the romance (or harem) part was good, not much to complain about really. Just like a lot of harem animes I've seen, this anime takes more of a Slice of Life approach, with no real direction of any goal, and simple but reasonable backstory to back the situation. So don't expect to feel attached to the anime, it just does what harem animes do and indeedthis anime does it right.\\n\\n\r\n9/10 art & sound.\\n\r\nIn my opinion, A-1 Pictures is one of the best anime producers in the scene, having seen many of their animes, this anime lacks no flair and/or quality the other animes have presented. One suggestion though, from me personally, is that I would like the colours to be more vibrant, but at its current state is fine too.\\n\\n\r\n6/10 characters.\\n\r\n-As to characters, it's not bad per se, but it could've been so much better. I'll try to review this without spoilers, assuming you haven't been spoiled from the comment section yet. A particular relationship in this anime is pretty unique. Two people who take the concept of love from a different perspective. This anime could've done so much more with their perspective of love, like spending some time on their thought process and/or more elaboration. But it simply neglected the idea and brushed it aside with a simple explanation with tasteless Ex Machina.\\n\\n\r\n*I will only be talking about characters which I think wasn't well presented. As to the other characters, they were good and average.*\\n\\n\r\n-Himeka Akishino\\n\r\nThis character absolutely did the light novel series no justice. Her introduction was loosely tied together and besides a sloppy explanation, it provided absolutely no backstory or reason as to why viewers would want to root for her or as to why she should be a strong contender for the main protagonist's love interest.\\n\\n\r\n-Ai Fuyuumi\\n\r\nShe revealed she was a childhood friend of the protagonist that he had met ten years ago. The story didn't elaborate on their childhood even the slightest bit and thus her status as a childhood friend becomes absolutely worthless and thus providing no sentimental value for us to empathise or even for her to be a strong contender.\\n\\n\r\nSo I hope this review helped in some way. Feel free to discuss or disagree with my take of this anime. I know that the review took a turn towards the end, but make no mistake, this is really, truly a splendid harem anime, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it. Thanks for your time.\\n",

The whole summary is \"Other girls chase Eita, She kinda wins the battle saying she is her Boyfriend\" Rinse and repeat this episode after episode.\\n\\n\r\nAkishino Himeka is Eita's girlfriend from a different world.....Yeah.\\n\r\nHimeka is a strange one, a character thrown into the bunch with no point or depth, She just Loves Eita and feels very robotic in the ways she is portrayed in the series.\\n\\n\r\nFuyuumi  Ai is Eita's long lost childhood friend, Again apart from the obvious past showing who she was in Eita's life her persona became pointless and bland, Just another character to add to the Harem, Nothing more nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\r\nOverall, I felt they added too many to this, I know they wanted to make it a \"Harem\" but they need to give these side characters some substance which for the most (Apart from Chiwa) they don't.\\n\r\nThis series should of just been Eita/Chiwa & Masuzu (The Fake Girlfriend) and focuses their time on them, Add more depth to the 2 female characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we get onto the Ending, Which without spoiling it didn't leave me satisfied at all.\\n\\n\r\nFor me this is a nice presented series, But lacks that true substance, Only reason to watch it would be the plot for Chiwa which is thought was supremely put across, Apart from this it's just another run of the mill Rom/Com\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong though, I liked it a bit, But isn't anything special, But one that was worth a watch at the very least.\\n\\n\\n",

Hopefully they will bring out a second season because this was a great unexpected surprisefor how good it was and I would love to see more!\\n",

I thought to myself \"That looks like it'll be really crappy and really boring.\" I love harems so you could say that my opinion on this anime is biased, but to each his own! \r\nStory 8/10\r\nThe reason i give it a 8 is because i feel like one of the main girls was totally not necessary in the anime. She was actually annoying, in my opinion, and she almost had no point in being in the anime. There was also a couple parts in the story that were likeevery other romance/harem story's.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound 9/10\\n\r\nI cant really complain about the animation and sound quality to much because i really liked it! It was different from other animes i watched, but it was a good different. The reason it isn't a full ten is because it wasn't the best id ever seen and heard.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nI absolutely loved the main chick in this anime. NOT THE BEST FRIEND. The guy was very amusing in my opinion and i found all the characters entertaining at one point or another. I feel as if we didn't get very much background on all the girls though so that's why i give it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nFor anyone looking for a laugh and a harem then i highly suggest this anime!",

(well, since i cannot create something like that, i will accept it lol.)\\n\\n\r\nSound = 8/10\\n\r\nThe OP and ED of this song is enjoyable, i like it especially the ending song.\\n\r\nand for the voice actor/actress, i find it fits them pretty well.\\n\r\nand the background music is excellent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter = 9/10\\n\r\nThis is i think where this anime shines.\\n\r\nEach of oreshura character have a good back stories. they build up their character, little by little each episode. but some character only appeared for little time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment = 10/10\\n\r\nActually, i really enjoy watching this anime. i like the romcom, and harem feeling when watching this.\\n\r\nOverall = 8.4\\n",

            "content": "MAJOR SPOILERS THAT RUIN MOST MAJOR PLOT POINTS AHEAD\r\nTo start with, I don't write reviews hardly ever but if I found something interesting enough to talk about I will that being said I rate this show a 3 and it blows my mind how so many people like it let's start by going over the key review points.\r\nStory\r\nAs a harem anime the story doesn't really matter that much however this one went for a little bit of story with the character having a rather embarrassing notebook that one of the girls use to blackmail him (See more in character)\r\nArt\r\nThe art is trying way too hardto look nice and as a result I feel like someone put the entire thing through a glow filter everything glows so much it actually hurt my eyes at times and when the show is even glowing during some dark scenes it looks absolutely horrible. The worst part to all this is the animation isn't all that bad they just had to get rid of the glowiness\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI mean... it's studio recorded? I don't know why this is even a section it sounds ok I guess but I don't really focus on audio all that much\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters are awful people however the show doesn't seem to realise that these people shouldn't be rooted for they constantly paint them in good light while making them do horrendous things, let's look deeper.\\n\\n\r\nMasuzu throughout the entire show is blackmailing the MC in a an awful way, not only this but she steals his first ever kiss and constantly sets out to ruin his time with friends (See episode 10). Masuzu has not a single redeeming quality as a character and should be treated as the villain in the show but instead she's one of the heroines.\\n\\n\r\nHimeka has no right to even be apart of this harem literally just hugging the MC one day and deciding \"Yeah I was your ex girlfriend in a past life, now date me\" and the MC just goes along with it and never says to her \"Please stop, you're scaring me\" or something to that effect. She has no personality what so ever and no interests or ambitions, you could take her out the show and nothing would change in any of the dynamics and it's only in episode 11 the other girls even really acknowledge her existence.\\n\\n\r\nFuyuumi is a terrible person using her influence as a hall monitor to break up the maidens club just so the other girls can't hang out with the MC anymore and that's just her introduction. She constantly lies about a fake boyfriend for no real reason and is hung up on a marriage certificate drafted 10 years ago by someone primarily ignoring her. All this brings me to my next point, were they really even childhood friends? I mean he doesn't remember her at all and most of the clips we see is mainly him ignoring her so to me it seems that she might have a few screws loose.\\n\\n\r\nKaoru is a terrible friend, I mean first of all they knew the MC is \"going out\" with Masuzu and him and Chiwa \"flirt\" but they're still gonna try and add in Fuyuumi to the mix? All this and then start leaning on him in later episodes all flirtatiously did they see what happened in School Days when you try and pull that stunt? \\n\\n\r\nChiwa is best character in the show but at the same time doesn't fit in the show because everyone in the show is such a bad person that she seems too perfect. But none the less let's discuss why she should of been final choice.\\n\\n\r\n-They've known each other for 9 years and have pretty much spent the whole time hanging out together\\n\\n\r\n-After she got injured he dedicated himself to getting good grades to become a doctor on the off chance he could help her in the future. He also learned to cook just for her and she comes round for meals pretty consistently throughout the show\\n\\n\r\n-She lost her goal in life and as such is trying to become popular to replace it but as the show goes on she does this less and less showing actual character development (Something everyone else lacked).\\n\\n\r\n-When she gets sick one episode he spends the day with her and even helps rub her back, this shows his dedication to her is even greater than his grades\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion she should of won and he should of really cut the other 4 out of his life and found some better friends (Yes, Kaoru too)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nYou know how some shows you can watch all the way through in one sitting? You know some shows you have to stop after a few episode or even one episode? Yeah, I had to stop this show every 10 minutes because of how cringe inducing most scenes are.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nThe show feels like it had no real goal in mind except to make a bit of money for the studio and it lacks any compelling elements that make you go \"Yeah I'd watch this again\". The show's generic to the very core yet somehow despite being just character archetypes and cliches it somehow manages to not even be a 5 due to it getting every single thing it's aiming for wrong. The show is one of the worst shows I've seen yet it wasn't awful the comedy works sometimes and there's some scenes I like (which usually get ruined by someone walking in) and I liked the whole backstory between the MC and Chiwa and feel the show should of focused more on that.",

The plot is fine, not that exciting but it gets better as the story proceeds. They have shown love war between the girls to get the guy (protagonist).\r\nBut I like the anime when it gives some message which relates to our life.\r\nSo I'll come straight to the message, people sometimes can't conclude their own feelings but others can easily seethrough and help the find themselves and be themselves, also the fact that love is not something that can be faked is shown very nicely in the flow.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY is pretty neat and artwork is good.\\n\r\nCHARACTERS really do suit given the plot and sound and voice work is nice.\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment its not that bad nor really good either.\\n\\n\r\nBasically it is light and fun to watch anime.",

I like the concept when there's harem but the girls is not too much, i can tolerate 4 or 5 more than that is too much and the character development become much harder to put into the story. this anime is more of like 'your' generic harem school type anime (if you watching those kinda stuff of course) the story is cliche. But the main reason i like this anime is not because the harem but because characters especially the main protagonist, pretty much the background of all character is not asclear as we think it is. That is why i give it 7 despite of its generic type of story.\\n",

            "content": "Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru, shortened to Oreshura, is a harem comedy that I actually enjoyed and I hate the harem genre. My worst experience with the accursed harem genre so far was watching things like Girl's Bravo and Maburaho. Those almost made me quit anime altogether, quite frankly. Those disgusting, pandering, weirdly drawn boobs-in-face-every-few-seconds shows were not for me.\r\n\t\u2022 Although, we know from the first episode that one of the female mains, Masuzu, goes commando. Fanservice wasn't the centerpiece of the series.  I initially did not like Masuzu as much as the internet seemed to because she seemed like anotherboring, witty Senjougahara archetype, but I eventually got woed by her feminine wiles and continuous Jojo's Bizarre Adventure references.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 I grew up with things like Tenchi Muyo!, Ranma, and Saber Marionette J, so I guess a part of me wasn't completely opposed to the harem genre (even though the shows themselves are like average, average, and bad; nostalgia can be an important factor). Those mid-2000's harems were just the fucking worst. If you want to see the same three-tier female archetypes with multi-colored hair, rubbing themselves up and down a normal looking guy, who everyone wants to bang, then feel free to revisit that era of anime. I dare you. Better yet, watch Eiken.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The main character of Oreshura, Eita, is bland. He's like a less male power fantasy version of Araragi, in the sense that he altruistically tries to help girls. I barely even remember what he looks like. And besides the main two girls, the other two can be boiled down to crazy tsundere and zany chuuni girl with past life issues. Neither of them are acceptable options, in that regard. Though the main girls have their own set of issues, Masuzu being a habitual liar and Chiwa being the annoying childhood friend. I think being a childhood friend is the unfortunate curse in anime that means that you\u2019re fated to never be loved.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Now that we know that the background characters have only slightly more personality than those of Plastic Memories (which had the most UNIMAGINATIVE characters of all time, if you didn\u2019t sense the overwhelming sarcasm in the last statement), let's venture into the other aspects of the show. The characters are thrust into pretty typical situations like classrooms and beach episodes, so that really isn't important. I think the thing that was good about Oreshura, aside from bland protagonist syndrome, was that the characters are dysfunctional and have problems. Somewhat resembling the real world, except living life as a real person is not nearly as sexually appealing\u2026 or pastel. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Overall, it's enjoyable to watch. The character can be pretty typical to the light novel genre, but it was fun and there were some sweet romantic moments, as well as A-1 Pictures usually having enough cash to make something substantially good. I give it a 6/10.",

            "content": "Ore no Kanojo does literally nothing special in the harem genre standpoint except for one thing. You have the dull \"WHOA I NEVER KNEW YOU LIKED ME\" MC, the tsundere, the quiet reserved girl, the childhood friend, BUT YOU HAVE SOMEWHAT OF A CONCLUSIVE ENDING HURAAY.(I won't spoil it don't worry)\r\nStory 3/10:\r\nI mean the story is nothing special. It's about a guy who is secretly a superhero dork who writes his little fantasties within his notebook BUT guess what? One of the main heroine discovers his notebooks and blackmails him to become her boyfriend. He agrees but the childhood friend comes in and feels threatenedby the new girl and this whole series is just a crap fest of which girl can steal the heart of the MC. LITERALLY nothing new. The story bored me and most romance anime do, trust me. But like I always say, a romance anime can literally have the crappiest story but if it has really personal and well thought out chracters then the author did a good job. The author does nothing right.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10:\\n\r\nI always have been a fan of the A1 Studios art, it's very modern and clean and this anime is no exception. The colors are bright and cheerful and it fits the theme and setting of this anime pretty well. The art isn't something that I'll say \"WOW\" but it is appealing to the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10:\\n\r\nI literally only liked one character in this anime LOL. Every other character has such apparent character flaws that it honestly made me bored/annoyed everytime the characters popped up. I mean for starters the MC is really smart academically but bro you seriously can't tell that your childhood friend likes you? And there are two other girls literally saying that they want to marry you but you don't take them seriously and just try to avoid them. AH just like in every harem genre, the MC is a dimwit and it's just really frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10:\\n\r\nThe anime was somewhat enjoyable because of Ai(that one character I liked). Everything regarding this anime was subpar but if you like a comedic and bright anime then I recommend this anime to you. Just to warn you though, even though there is a somewhat of a conclusive ending and is supposed to make the audience think \"What's going to happen next\" I literally did not do that and immediately closed my browser once I finished the anime. Nothing against the anime, just another lame light novel. Just a rant(if a studio can adapt this garbage then why not Utsoro? SIGH)\\n",

            "content": "Shallow, weak characters. Weak main male character. Annoying, pretentious female lead with very little redeeming qualities. Jointed, predictable plot. OreShura is a rehash of a rehash of a rehash. And when you've gone past two rehashes, that's not a good thing. That's a very bad thing. A very, very bad thing. And normally I'd keep quiet about shows that I didn't enjoy, but I feel like some points nevertheless must be addressed about this particular show, to serve as a warning.\r\nI was thrown off by how much I disliked the female lead (Masuzu). She explodes onto the scene and attracts everyone's attention, typical oujou-sama style.Her character isn't too bad looking, and at this point I'm thinking, \"She must be a pretty interesting character.\" But I was wrong. The show attempts to make her as contemptible as possible, which I don't understand the reason for. I just didn't get it. It felt like the authors WANTED the viewers to feel absolutely frustrated with how shallow and character-lacking she was. It felt like I was watching a piece of paper flopping around and interacting with other, equally floppy pieces of paper, cut-outs of characters and their images. No special quality. No uniqueness to distinguish their place and role in the show. A bland continuation of \"going with the flow\" and \"force the situation onto the main character\". The way Masuzu just forced herself onto the main character's life was incredibly irritating and unnecessary. It created a gaping hole in her character that would not be filled for all the episodes to come, no matter how good of a relationship the main character builds with her over time. Her introduction was a failure, and her reservations and desires of the main male character were empty and unsatisfactory. \\n\\n\r\nA bit strange to talk about the main character after the lead female, but this is the crux of the issue. As with many harem shows, this main character is nothing more than the embodiment of what I refer to as, \"personality in the gaseous form\". That is, the character is so devoid of its own characteristics and decision-making abilities that it fails to impact the plot in any major way. Not solid, or even liquid, but pure gaseous. It seeps through events, almost blending completely into the background, and only when the plot needs a push does he perform \"the right thing\".  The viewer is unable to penetrate the veil of ambiguity that is the main character, which defeats the purpose of a clearly told story. While I understand it's a harem and that anything can happen in a harem, the story does not even attempt to make the viewer even a little emotionally invested in any of the characters, or anything that's happening. The MMC is a combination of weakness and head-strong personality, the worst mix possible. I felt like throwing up whenever he played his \"Because I'm righteous\" card. Give me a break. \\n\\n\r\nThe conflicts, which would normally serve as the jumping points for emotion, plot progression, character development, and a shift in the flow of the events, are also forced and trivial. Petty. Unsubstantiated. Unreasonable. They held little meaning to me, especially when the antagonistic forces were as equally trivial as the protagonists. Or perhaps, it was simply because the main character was, again, quite weak. \\n\\n\r\nHah. I just realized who some of the characters remind me of. So like, Masuzu is probably a scaled down, much less interesting version of Chitoge, from Nisekoi, and Hime (the third harem member introduced, because that is where I stopped), is also the equivalent of a scaled down, much less interesting Rikka, from Chuunibyou. I don't know about the childhood friend. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason I gave it a 6 and not a 5 (as tempted as I was) was that, it is understandably difficult to flesh out every single character in a 13 episode show. The artwork wasn't too shabby. And admittedly, there were a few moments when I thought my mouth would give a ghost of a smile. \\n\\n\r\nA combination of poor character development, poor characters in general, petty conflicts, and lack of motivation to care about the characters, however, all contributed to making this quite a disappointing 6-episode trial and a waste of time.",

Reasons vary depending on the situation, but the main objetive remains the same: living without disappointments and rejection.\r\n{STORY - 6/10}\r\nHaving his parents divorced and being rejected on Junior High induced Eita on despising love completely, plus having a chuunibyou crysis. Trying to forget this horrible past, he gave up onto creating any kind of close relationship with girls, dedicating himself on studying the whole time... That until Masuzu gets transferred to the same class...\r\nFinding someone who is as cold as her, Masuzu takes this chance to forceEita on being her fake boyfriend. That way, other classmates would stop bothering her, but what about Eita? His childhood friend really believes on this act and it feels like betrayal... Moreover, two liars can always develop feelings for each other...\\n\\n\r\n{ART - 8/10}\\n\\n\r\nThe intense use of light colors and a simple, yet gorgeous design, made the overall art look as sweet as the OP theme itself. Fantastic intro and ending themes, full of visual effects, feature amazingly made backgrounds and a huge variety of unique paints!\\n\\n\r\n{SOUND - 7/10}\\n\\n\r\nBackground music is always making presence to make up for the lack of effects (that aren't need). A cheering song, featuring the voices from all four girls, is featured on the OP theme, while a slow and tender one plays during endings.\\n\\n\r\n{CHARACTERS - 5/10}\\n\\n\r\nStarring too few and common personalities is one of the weak points. However, both Eita and Masuzu stand out, due to their pretty original attitude. They share a mutual hate for love and just want to be alone, moving on and living peacefully. The whole act thing may change this conception a little bit...\\n\\n\r\nThree other girls are pulled into this battlefield, as they try to prove their love for Eita. Being a childhood friend should give Chiwa some boost onto reaching her objective (and actually does). Cheerful, gentle and fragile, her love for Eita can't be measured. Later introduced, Himeka also suffered from chuunibyou and strongly believes being Eita's alter ego girlfriend. She's the cute and quiet type one. Ai represents a total tsundere and deliberately tries to make Eita remember from a promise they both made in the past.\\n\\n\r\n{ENJOYMENT 10/10}\\n\\n\r\nFor a long time, I felt just like Eita: unconcerned about futile matters and focusing on important things. I guess I could identify myself a bit with him... The meaning underneath all this situation is that we can always hurt ourselves, but this shouldn't keep us from being happy, with or without love...\\n\\n\r\n{OVERALL - 7/10}\\n\\n\r\nLove may be unkind. It can tear you down from deep inside, make you forget about your main ambitions and even turn you into a totally emotionless being. It all depends ln your choices, so it's not to be blamed at all... Eita doens't understand this particular feeling very well and he knows that it can turn his life upside down. Yet, he can't deny the existence of tenderness on his heart... The question is who should be the one receiving it from him...",

It was reminiscent of Chuunibyou in a way, with the whole Burning Fighting Fighter thing and all. It had an interesting premise, and I'm a fan of romances, so I thought I could get into it. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. OreShura was a grim reminder of why I shouldn't watch shows with a Harem tag.\r\nImagine a semi-decent romance story. Okay. Now imagine 4 of them. In the same setting. With the same loser guy. I understand it serves assome sort of fantasy fulfillment for some, but that's not what I'm looking for in an anime. It killed any sort of romantic tension it could've had.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what pissed me off about OreShura (and what made me write this review) was the ending. Not because it was bad, it was par for the couse actually, but because they teased me with a very good ending in the first half of the episode, then killed it in the second half. Too bad, I was starting to actually enjoy myself until I was reminded that things would barely change at all, and that there would still be 3 girls going after a guy in an actual commited relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy was good though.

            "content": "Hey everyone, today I'm going to make a looong (and I mean it) review about Ore no Kanojo - so here's my \"very gentlemen\" like greetings to all of you. Even if I really love romance, harem, and school-life themed anime, I'm a total action-craver. So with that, me watching an anime like this, is pretty insane. But by watching this anime, I finally opened my eyes to the world of rom-com animes. But just FYI, this anime isn't a normal rom-com - it's pretty different from the \"normal\" ones.\r\nSo, to start off, here's the summary of the anime that you guys probably all read,but here I go anyway: \"Eita enters high school aiming for the National University School of Medicine. Because of his parents' divorce\u2014and his goal\u2014he shuns anything to do with romance or love. One day, Masuzu, the school beauty with the silver hair who has just returned to the country, enters his life in a most unexpected way. Chiwa, his childhood friend since elementary school, will not let this go without a fight.\" So now that the summary is out of the way, I'm gonna start talking about my first impression before watching the anime. When I first read the summary, I thought it'd be something like Accel World without the Brain Burst and all the actions (Shoutouts to all the Accel World fans. We really need a second season!). I thought it was going to be like \"the popular girl falls in love with the main character kind of thing like Accel World - except in this case, none like how Haru, the main character from Accel World, is a loser, and Eita is the smartest (not the nerdy kind) student in the whole school. But I knew I was wrong even before the first episode of Ore no Kanojo ended. It's more like Onisekoi in the sense of how they have to fake being a couple. Mazusu, the all-star popular girl is very manipulative, yet \"evil\" girl who uses Eita's probably one of the very few weaknesses - his fantasy-filled notebook he used to write. She threatens Eita to fake being her boyfriend so people would stop asking her out - being asked out 52 (or something like that)times in two months is self-explainable. She makes a club to lure Chiwa in, which later becomes their sort of HQ of some sort where the girls who like Eita (its a harem if you didn't know) meet up at lunch, and all the other stuff. \\n\\n\r\nWoah, I think I typed way too much.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 9\\n\r\nI overall really enjoyed how things were drawn. By the way, I'm very picky about how the anime is drawn. I NEVER watch anime with the old drawings no matter how good the story, song, or character is. Some people may have been annoyed how the anime was drawn, but in my opinion, I think it was absolutely enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nThe sound was, um, \"interesting\". The ending was better than the opening, but it wasn't too bad. The song overall is the song that fits the anime in a way, but I'm thinking it could've been much better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9\\n\r\nThis is one of the greatest reasons on why I watched this anime. The characters were very good. Masuzu reminded me of Kuroyukihime a bit. Although the \"childhood friend\" Chiwa's words made me cringe time to time, and how she was annoying, the characters were absolutely fantastic. Most of the characters were the typical romance anime characters with different faces, they were unique from others. The characters were very deep, and it's one of the two anime where I like all the characters - Trinity Seven being the other (WE REALLY NEED A SECOND SEASON ON THIS ONE TOO). \\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\nThe story was in between decent and good. The story was good, but not really my type. It would've been better for me if Masuzu asked out Eita because she actually liked him, and if it would've been the normal romance anime, but I know I'm just being greedy because lots of the watchers out there loved how this anime was, and the fact Masuzu being like this is what makes Ore no Kanojo what it is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8 \\n\r\nIt was good, and if they were to make a second season, I'd definitely watch it. Although, I really wish it could've been more \"romantic\" between Masuzu and Eita, but I can't complain about that, because like I said, that was what made this anime what it is. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, and hope you didn't hate it so much :)",

            "content": "Ore no Kanojo to Osananajimi ga Shuraba Sugiru is NOT just another harem romcom. I've had my full fill of harem romcoms, and few hit the mark like this one does. And I'm not just saying that because it has higher quality content, but also because it has DIFFERENT content. You might have no idea what I'm talking about, so I'll be very specific.\r\nEach of the heroines actually has a real reason to \"fall in love\" with the protagonist. They don't suddenly start falling into his lap for no reason, but they rather each come to him in a well paced manner for very believablereasons. Of course, that said, other romcoms aren't necessarily unrealistic in this respect. Girls and guys ask each other out all the time just because of physical or emotional attraction without anything deeper being there. However, the fact that there is a deeper reason behind each heroine loving the protagonist gives Oreshura that much more depth.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also the concept of a fake relationship. While this concept might not seem unique, I've only seen one other anime where it is central to the plot. The way this anime goes about the fake relationship is outright different than what I've seen before. I can't say more than that without spoiling the anime. It might not seem like much, but even this alone makes it stand out from the vast majority of romcoms, harem or not.\\n\\n\r\nOreshura also doesn't end in a way that just maintains the status quo. The final episode changes things significantly enough that a second season of this anime would not have the same feel in many regards. Again, I cannot elaborate without spoiling it, but the fact that this anime does not have a static ending sets it far apart from the typical romcom.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that I will admit it has many similarities to other harem romcoms (such as a sometimes far too clueless protagonist), but it is also not littered with certain things that plague other romcoms, like constant ecchi fanservice or lewd joke after lewd joke. While this show does have its fair share of comedy, it takes a turn for the serious quite often (and not necessarily in a romantic way).\\n\\n\r\nI watched Oreshura in two days. I would have watched it in one had I not had to sleep badly. I don't usually go straight through anime even as short as this, preferring to pace myself, but this one was so good that I couldn't help but be pulled into the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend Oreshura to anyone who wants to watch a school romcom that is far better than the norm.\\n\\n\r\nNow, something for the MAL review elitists, even though the guidelines are not rules and my review has already met what a review MUST be. Plus, I actually have something relevant to say about each section this time. Feel free to skip this part as the review before this paragraph was the real review.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story was nothing special, though there is the potential for it to develop into a truly strong plot if one of the elements is developed more significantly. I was disappointed that element wasn't elaborated on more; however, given that this was only a 13 episode season I  understand why it wasn't developed more yet as it would have completely thrown off the pacing. Saving such development for later in the story is a good idea, but it means that the story covered in this season is nothing special. It's nothing profound. It's nothing that will change your life. But it's certainly good, good enough for me to say it's well above the average plot, though nowhere near a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nART: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI have one reason for giving Oreshura a maximum art score. And that is that the art is unique. While I like the typical style of anime these days, it is getting old to see the same exact style in almost every single new anime, and the same applies to the year Oreshura came out in. But Oreshura's art has an almost muted and pastel feel to the colors. Between that and the character design, which while similar to the typical style these days has large enough differences to distinguish them from other anime, I feel the art of this anime stands out against a sea of anime that look practically the same as each other.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the most pointless section in my opinion, as unless the sound or music are particularly noteworthy or terrible, it's not worth even mentioning. Perhaps the only value of this section is to make one's arbitrary score slightly less arbitrary if one even chooses to average the section scores. Nothing about the sound stood out in Oreshura. The voice acting was good, but not noteworthy. The opening and ending themes were actually quite catchy, but not something I'd go out of my way to listen to, and the rest of the music was average and forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are lovable and cute, but that's not nearly enough to warrant a 10/10. I give them a 10/10 because they are NOT typical of their character archetypes. Childhood friend characters are almost always boring with the personality and art design of a wet towel. And yet in this case, we a get a loli with short twintails wearing a collar that is quite eccentric in her own right and isn't a weakling that just rolls over to everyone else. The girlfriend character doesn't even have an basic archetype, which is absolutely refreshing. Her emotions bounce around so much, from friendly to harsh to loving to depressed, that you really buy this twisted girl as a real human being. She's not anywhere near hysterical, but she's also obviously not in control. She is the antithesis of extreme character types. The chuunibyo girl was the character I was most worried about being bland, but when they paired the chuunibyo trait with a kuudere-like quiet, monotone voice and very forward actions I was pleasantly surprised. I don't think I've seen that combination of character traits before. The only character that comes even close to typical is the tsundere, and even then she's far more shy and dere than any tsundere I've ever seen, though not nearly so much that I could consider her even close to being a dandere. And lastly we have the protagonist, who while he might not seem like much, is an intelligent boy who got to the top of his class through sheer determination, which is a sharp contrast to the average everyman we usually get for a protagonist. He is typically clueless about the heroines' true feelings, and he does see them as an annoyance as many protagonists often do, but the rest of his personality makes him a character I'm not used to seeing. He's not an idiot, and that is very refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much point to this section given that it's clearly obvious I thoroughly enjoyed Oreshura. From start to finish, not even one episode disappointed me.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe average of the section scores is 8.8, but I'd already decided on a 9/10 before I even wrote this review. This anime is not one of my absolute favorites nor is it a masterpiece, but it very much stood out to me as a unique and well-written work. I look forward to a second season, and if there isn't one, I'll quite likely buy the light novels or the manga.",

            "content": "This anime would be your typical harem without all the action you are used to seeing in a classic harem. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed it, with gut wrenching awkward scenes and hilarious situational irony this show was a pleasure to watch. \r\nEita (hope I'm remembering that right) is the center of affection for his childhood friend who also happens to be his neighbor, Chiwa (also hope that is right). He studies hard everyday to strive for a higher goal of becoming a doctor, which leaves little time for a love life, but this is okay because each morning he rises and denounces thevery thing he has no time for. This all changes when the most sought after girl in school, Masuzu declares his love for him in front of their entire class. The pair rush from school hand in hand until Eita feels it's safe to confront her, upon doing so she pulls out a notebook (which I thought was a deathnote and got waaay to excited) and begins to read passages from it. Moments go by before Eita realizes this notebook is HIS old notebook and Masuzu now has the power over him to reveal all his childish fantasies to the rest of the world. This blackmail begins by Masuzu revealing that she also hates love and she enlists Eita as her \"fake\" boyfriend in order to keep all the other guys at school from pestering her about dates.\\n\\n\r\nIt may seem a simple premise but when you throw in Himeka, the slightly delusional past lover from Eitas' fantasies written in said notebook, and Ai-chan, Eitas' original childhood friend whom he had forgotten about until she sprung on him a marriage license written by the both of them in their kindergarten years. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all this anime is pretty great watch, and one of those scenarios that you could actually see happening in life where one person is the center of affection for multiple people, and you find yourself thinking who will he choose in the end.",

            "content": "Lion Tamers, Lion Tamers; let's put on on our Clive Beaty Safari Hat (we'll need it) and carry a chair and a whip. These accouterments will be necessary to prevent certain special effects from infecting and spoiling our cloths; and our self-respect.\r\nThe anime we will examine is \"Oreshura\", which I will use to name it in the future.\r\nThat long Japanese monster of a title, while accurate; doesn't say anything to anyone, except a die-hard english speaking Japanese language enthusiast. A true Japanese person would have trouble explaining what that monster of a title means, to anyone but another Japanese national.\r\nI even tried to get adirect translation of \"Ore no kanojo to osananajimi ga shuraba sugiru\", which gave me \"My Girlfriend and Childhood Friend Fight Too Much\". After receiving this translation, I just sat for five minutes, dumbfounded; that a title as innocuous as that, actually was important enough to produce an Anime of 13-chapters.\\n\\n\r\nBut I digress. Oreshura translates to \"I Shura\". Which means the original long-monster title means something I don't care about, and the newer short title means absolutely nothing. \"Shura\" is not a 'person, place, or thing' in this Anime. If you are confused by all this, you can imagine how confused I was about this.\\n\r\n------------------\\n\\n\r\nBut let's try to get into the Anime itself.\\n\\n\r\n1). Firstly, let's give a way a plot point, as a means of disassembling a non-sequitor. While there is an argument between our main character fellows' girlfriend and his childhood friend, this happens so rarely in the Anime, that the title isn't anywhere near the mark. A closer title would have been; \"The Lion, The witch, and the Wardrobe\". Oops!? I can't use that, it's already taken by a live-action movie. Drat!\\n\\n\r\n2). The girlfriend. while the show goes to great lengths to point out that our two protagonists are not interested in ordinary puppy love, but instead are just trying to create a situation where both (but mainly the female) can avoid further dating requests and the usual behind the scenes comments from fellow classmates that just happen to like these two peoples' looks. And we find that some comments are made snidely, and presented by people that aren't happy about anything.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's look deeper. This Anime had a real chance to take this story into a real character based mystery and blew it. The whole reason of the female 'Mazusu' wanting to leave all that running and jumping behind, was not the constant approaches, but paranoia developed after total insanity came about while living with her father. Her father then decided she needed a change of scene, and sent her from Sweden to Japan, on the condition that she would be reported on, by her own sister, to their mutual father.\\n\\n\r\nFather had brought about a situation that forced his wife, their mother, to leave, never to return; leaving the two daughters to the fathers' tender mercies. The narrative stops very suddenly, and we are never allowed to see the rest of the reasons for the tortured soul that is Mazusa.\\n\\n\r\nAll the above is in the Anime, and I'm told, elaborated upon slightly, in the Light Novel.\\n\\n\r\nIs she sane? No. Is she dangerous? No. Is she a conniving little rat, that uses her obvious physical allure to get what she wants? Yes! Should she be able to do this at the tender age of fifteen? Absolutely not! But she does. And the unfinished back-story to her character could have easily shown us a reason for this criminal but precocious behavior.\\n\\n\r\nAnd thereby hangs my objection to these goings on. We had a right to know how this personality evolved into the Mazusa we see in this Anime. Without that explanation, the whole story becomes weak and unsatisfying. Without it, the conflicts Mazusa creates with her rivals, becomes unnecessary. Mazusa connives in ways unusual, even for an adult of training, in the misleading of assailants (such as an espionage agent) for reasons that are unclear.\\n\\n\r\nShe offsets blame, by using blackmail against her own partner. That stress leads to confusions of meaning between the person blackmailed and other females in his social circle. She uses temporal doubts, to allow her to be absent, when she promises to be places, and then complains when her partner does not get that she is playing a ruse. In other words, she assumes her beau is just as criminally clever as she is, and gets mad when he can't see the future, as a consequence of her thinking, while she leaves him out of the planning.\\n\\n\r\nDoes she evolve as a personality? Slightly, but not in any way that means she won't do any of this stuff again. She even jokes about that possibility in the last episode, while laying on top of her fake beau, which of course confuses him. She is sexually adept in ways that he is not ready for, at his age. It becomes obvious that while she offers sex to him, in a philosophical way, she has no intention of actually carrying it out. Even though most of his other female friends would have no trouble completing sex with him.\\n\\n\r\nWhich gives us another reason to want to know what the hell the completed back story has in it, that creates this conundrum. A psychologist would probably be able to get pretty close. I'm gonna just pass something out there, and hope I get close. I'm so distressed that the story in Oreshura is so weak, that I have to offer an alternative plot that fits the conditions of the present story line, while giving us a much stronger and edgy'r product.\\n\\n\r\nWhat if the heavily dominated and controlled Mazusa was raped by her father?\\n\\n\r\nIt explains his desire to place rigid and very strange controls on her, to the extent that her sanity finally cracked, and she ended up in a sanitarium for awhile \"trying to please daddy\". It would explain why her mother left in disgust, and was chased out of this home, in order to prevent her from creating an escape for their eldest daughter; and silence her in political ways. The wealth displayed is enormous. What if daddy is a politician? It explains why Mazusa's younger sister reports on Mazusa in a conspiracy against daddy. \\n\\n\r\nBut most of all, it begins to give us an explanation for Mazusa's extreme and weird behavior, especially regarding her relations with boys her own age. It explains the social competence, while also givings us a cause for the desire to feel the air between her legs. She has this thing about wandering around with nothing under her skirt.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nI place the above, as a reason to have doubts about the competence of the authors. They had a chance to make this into a true horror story, that begins as a rom/com, and ends in a tragic horror story that would have raised the hackles of everyone who watches, while never getting all the way to Hentai Anime. It might have started a new genre. But the opportunity was blown, while all the plot points are present, to try again, and make something great! And that being said, by me. A person that doesn't like horror stories, in the main.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the plot is watered down, the dialog is very weak most of the time. The soundtrack is adequate, but not memorable. The opening and closing music is something I hate, which is J-pop, played fast, and in the process; creates a singing voice that sounds like a squirrel being strangled. A pity, as the singers are all people that are respected voice actors. The video and cartooning is a bit weak, as it is all done in fuzzy pastels (not a resolution problem, it's intentional); to make the scenes appear mildly romantic, even when the situations are anything else.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so I close this review, of a story with massive potential, never realized. A watered down mess, that ends with the viewer wanting to know what the future holds for our young fellow and his 4-female friends. And then their's his aunt, that told him outright, she wished he would chase her around the coffee table too. Another entire story arc, missed entirely.\\n\\n\r\nI give Oreshura a weak 6.\\n\\n",

This is pretty interesting since a hero and heroine are not \"an idiot who have love in their brain\". This makes them unique from everyday male harem protagonist. He still have delicate side to girls but not much, but what makes this anime 7/10 is even though the story have a good development is there's many mysterious thing that unsettled, such as Masuzu past, maybe it wasn't worth attention much if we can just guess by ourselves but for some people (including me) it bugs me..\r\nArt 10/10\r\nSmooth colouring, refreshingstyle, and nice artwork. All of this makes this anime eye comfort and unique. There are not much anime which have this kind of style\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nOP and Ed song just too good, I love it and in anime BGM is good too\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime is enjoyable, Eita 2nd grade syndrome and many inside jokes is refreshing and funny making this anime enjoyable and worth watch\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nThis anime is recommended for whom like school life romance and comedy, furthermore you won't regret ever watch this anime :)\\n\\n\\n",

I am really hoping for another season.\r\nI do have some criticisms of the story line though. As always, for the viewer to be able to deeply empathize with each of the characters, more development of them needed to be done. As it stands we know very little about the background of most of the girls. Yes, they all have some kind of connection to Eita, but we really don't know much about them. We also don't really understand what motivated Eita to declare his love for the one girl whomost tormented him. In order to understand that, we need to understand Eita's background better. Finally, the one girl who was most kind and loyal to Eita from the beginning, the one that motivated Eita to become studious and strive hard in school, was rejected. Why? What a cruel outcome. It just cannot stand, and I believe this hopefully will be addressed in any possible second series of this show.",

            "content": "A tsundere, a chunibiyo, and a childhood friend walk into a bar\u2026\r\nBefore I begin I need to say I only watched this based on crunchyroll\u2019s Q review.\r\nIt\u2019s a bright, colorful harem high school series with an interesting premise. It builds up the drama and tension while maintaining it\u2019s comedic base. It doesn\u2019t rub your face in it\u2019s fanservice. It\u2019s great IF you\u2019re into this sort of thing. And I am not, hence the nature of this review.\r\nProblem number one is Chiwa Harusaki. It is no secret that my most loathed thing in anime is characters who expect the object of their affection to return theirfeelings, without having to tell them how they feel. Plus she\u2019s loud and annoying, but at least she was honest about why she didn\u2019t want Eita hanging around with these other girls.\\n\r\nProblem number two is Ai Fuyuumi for the very same reasons as Chiwa except she she\u2019s in denial. On top of that her motivation for wanting to marry Eita is a one note gag that gets old fast. You promised me in kindergarten we would get married. I\u2019m picturing a 45 year old Ai Fuyuumi if she never met Eita again. A tired office lady who bores hosts then staggers home and falls asleep clutching a 40 year old note.\\n\r\nProblem number three is the inevitability of the show\u2019s climax. I don\u2019t want to spoil it here but it\u2019s so obvious that it can be called it\u2019s logical conclusion. It wouldn\u2019t make sense for the series to end any other way.\\n\r\nProblem number four is the amount of stalking and extortion that goes on in this show. One could say that it\u2019s done for comedic effect, but consider the premise then remember \u201cyou cannot extort those who refuse to be extorted.\u201d I reached the same conclusion that made me drop Wolf Girl & Black Prince; you must like it or you wouldn\u2019t tolerate it. Hence problem three.\\n\r\nAn honorable mention goes to Mana Natsukawa. What is with her and the little sister in A Town Where You Live? Now that I think about it, those two shows and SNAFU feature a girl who\u2019s kept as a doll for their family\u2019s political ambitions and have a meddling sister. But that is a topic to another time.\\n\r\nBecause this show centers around my most hated anime trope I had a hard time getting any entertainment value from it. It seems like an okay harem comedy but I\u2019ve seen better.\\n",

            "content": "I honestly came in and watched this with the lowest of the low expectations (that OP did not help, too), but I was pleasantly surprised how good it actually is.\r\nIf you want my quick opinion, I recommend this to anyone who likes RomComs.  It's damn funny, and the romance is pretty OK. The art style is worth taking note of (very reminiscent to Sakurasou), and it also has some decent drama, if that's your thing. Now, on to the review.\r\n-Gael Cliche-\r\nOK, bad things first. The story is about a very beautiful girl who gets in a fake relationship to avoid creepers. Hilarity ensues. Gee,haven't heard of that one before. They don't put in very many twists either, so the story gets predictable from time to time.\\n\\n\r\n-Choose Your Archetype-\\n\r\nThe cool beauty. The childhood friend. The stoic girl. The tsundere. The loli. Sigh. There is absolutely nothing wrong with archetypes, as long as you put your own twists in it (see: Steins;Gate, which uses harem archetypes (Kurisu is a tsundere, Mayushii is an airhead, etc.) in a non-harem setting). The problem stems from the fact that OreShura does very little in that department (the Mazusu-is-a-bitch route looked promising, but I feel they didn't exploit it enough).\\n\\n\r\n-Oven Ain't Hot Enough-\\n\r\nMost of the characters, in my opinion, are under-baked. They get very little airtime, and most of that airtime goes to comedy routines too. Hime's introduction lasts only 2 episodes, and most of it isn't even her on screen. Ai gets introduced waaay too late into the story, so I wasn't that invested in her (which is a shame, since her character could've been good). But what pisses me off, Natsukawa Masuzu, the MAIN FEMALE LEAD, is UNDERDEVELOPED. THE. MAIN. FEMALE. LEAD. I mean, just...how?!\\n\\n\r\nTo it's credit, Eita and Chiwa have really good character developments. I mean, it makes sense that Eita will be well developed (he is the MC, after all), but Chiwa? I mean, yes, I want each and every character to be developed well, but if you're going to pick only two characters to develop, why not pick, oh, I don't know, THE MAIN FEMALE LEAD?!\\n\\n\r\n-The Pet Girl of OreShura-\\n\r\nOn to the stuff I really liked. If you liked the general look of Sakurasou, then you are going to love this. The colors are all very light, and very easy on the eyes. I fell in love in first sight, to be honest.\\n\\n\r\n-My Rock-\\n\r\nWhen it comes to RomComs, OreShura is a very solid choice. The romance is pretty OK- it has its moments now and then- but the comedy is where this really shines. This anime is absolutely hilarious. Seriously, if you want a good laugh, just watch the first few episodes. The notebook gag and delusions gag in particular really gets to me, just because of how relatable it is.\\n\\n\r\n-Natsukawa Mazusa-\\n\r\nOK, I'm seriously not over this WHY IS THE MAIN FEMALE LEAD UNDERDEVELOPED?! I mean, geez...\\n\\n\r\nI could write a whole frackin' rant about this, but maybe some other time.",

The show started off with a lot of potential... but that gets thrown out within 5 episodes and becomes a boring harem. I honestly skipped to the end (only 2 eps left) because i couldn't take how the show had nothing going on except weird clingy girls doing the obvious to a clueless cliche \"loveless\" guy. The show would of been great had it followed just him, the \"fake\" girlfriend, and his childhood friend. While going deeper on each of their backgrounds and have them grow.\r\n The other twogirls would of been better off in just being a story for a episode or two. Having them stick around feels pointless. They aren't interesting, they are weird, and really give now growth to the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show was a let down from what it had in its first 3 episodes. If a second season comes it should go back to its roots and avoid the harem bs.",
