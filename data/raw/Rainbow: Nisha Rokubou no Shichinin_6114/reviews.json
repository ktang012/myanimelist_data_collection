            "content": "After finishing episode 1 of this series, I took a deep breath. I was so engrossed that I had apparently forgotten to breathe while I was watching.\r\nAfter finishing episode 26, I finally exhaled. This series was a rush of nonstop emotion all the way throw and never faltered for a second. Everything I said here over a half a year ago holds completely true and I can't flaunt my glowing recommendation for this series enough.\r\nRainbow is definitely one of the best things Japan has put out in a long time, and not in an ironic \"Oh, Japan!\" flashy comedy/campy/ridiculous way. It's a serious story. Soserious that the first episode starts off with a disclaimer about explicit content. Think about that for a second. In a medium like anime where there's blood, tits and who knows that else in so many shows, what are they warning you about? Real stuff, that's what. Unlike Lucy ripping the head off some moe girl in Elfen Lied, Rainbow is constantly presented as a brutal, depressing series where the violent content is required to present the story in a proper way.\\n\\n\r\nBut don't be put off because it sounds too depressing or even boring(I don't know how anyone could think this, personally), because Rainbow is also a story of true bro-ship. Like Gungrave before it, Rainbow will be bleak. It will be depressing. But through all that, a heartwarming tale of friendship will shine. A tale that's under the perpetual threat of being crushed by the blackened circumstances around it, and that's what will keep you engrossed.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is terrific, as expected of Madhouse by this point. This includes the great still art that pops in during narrated scenes, as seen by the series' title art to the left. The whole episode, and most likely a good portion of the series was depicted with very few colors other than shades of grey and dark blue. Any bright things on screen are bright things in the eyes of the story, like the sunshine outside or the end of a lit cigarette shared between the beaten characters. This was a very fine touch and does nothing but add to the heavy atmosphere of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe audio and the animation work beautifully in tandem, with the music bringing scenes to life by boosting the dank atmosphere. The opening by Coldrain is especially great, bringing a badass touch to the show. Similarly, the voices are gruff and work very well with the rest of the presentation.\\n\\n\r\nThe above was stated after watching episode 1, and now that the series is over I think it's time to address these issues. Firstly, Rainbow finished excellently. It did not, however, cover the entire 22 volumes of story and instead opted to stop around volume 12 or so. This is no reason to not watch the series, as the stopping point they chose was pretty tactfully chosen and very satisfying. When it comes to negatives, Rainbow suffered from two things at certain points: Pacing and over-emotion. Even if you haven't read the manga, there's a good chance you'll notice that certain parts, mostly in the second half, seem rushed or like they crammed too many chapters into an episode and that makes it seem like the story skips around a little too much. It's not a big deal at all and very rarely detracts from anything, but it's a factor you'll probably notice. One of the bigger factors that may not sit well with some is that the series can come off as a little too over-dramatized or sappy at points. Sometimes the manly guitar solos and power ballads work incredibly well and you'll be clenching your teeth with man tears streaming down your cheeks, and other times it doesn't work too well. That's something that'll vary a lot from person to person though. \\n\\n\r\nThe final thing that bothered me was that one of the characters never gets an episode or arc devoted to him, which is pretty unsettling considering the other six boys got the spotlight multiple times. That was the main casualty of the long manga->short anime transition, so what can you do?\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, Rainbow's definitely in the top 10, maybe even top 5 shows of the year 2010. Not watching it should be a crime.",

            "content": "*This review WILL contain spoilers\r\n Since the anime has such a high score and a crazy amount of 10/10 reviews (what aggravates me, because its far from perfect), i will write a review, pointing all of the problems i found with it. This anime was very hard to watch and relate to at a lot of points. No, not because of how sad and harsh it is, but because as an anime that takes itself seriously its too inconsistent and illogical. Now don't get me wrong, this anime has a lot of strong points, but they still can't fully cover for all the flaws. Illstart from the very beginning, and state every problem i personally spotted and can remember (by chronological order).\\n\\n\r\n An-chan \"kills\" his father. Its also said he committed suicide. So how exactly did An-chan get to the reformatory? Did he turn himself in to the police saying he is the one who did it? If so, did no one bother checking? Because his father didn't have a grudge against him, and logically would commit suicide in a way that can't be connected to his son (to avoid giving him more trouble)... What follows is the suicide incident (in the reformatory). An-chan didn't seem to be a stupid guy. He only had a few months left, so he could just quietly get out and bring both the bad guys to justice. Instead he decided to tell Ishihara that he knows. WHY? No logical explanation is provided, and none is even possible. \\n\\n\r\n Next up is \"Turtle\". I'm not sure about the circumstances of the post nuclear bombing aid that was given (or not given) in japan, but shouldn't he have been placed in some sort of hospital and/or trauma rehabilitation facility, and if he ran off and was judged, wouldn't he at least get a more considerate verdict based on his personal file?\\n\\n\r\n Moving on. When the boys come to the reformatory, they seem to be already familiar with each other, how, and when did that happen, and why is it not mentioned? Also why did An-chan decide to beat them all up when they got there? Because it was completely unnecessary, and frankly out of character for him to do so, the only reason for this event i can think of is to speed up their bonding instead of showing it develop overtime (though frankly i doubt that one as well, because usually no one would bond with someone that beat them up faster that if he wouldn't)... The boys in the reformatory also seem to have the ability to go the the library as they please, yet never use it except for one time... What's the point of sitting in a prison cell then if they can always or at least sometimes be in the library?!\\n\\n\r\n Side characters. They just seem to be there for decoration, as if no one else even exists. When Joe runs away and gets caught, he clearly states that the woman who took him in raped him in front of two guards, and she replies in a hostile way and even hits him and draws blood. The two guards seem shocked, but this does not lead anywhere. When the fire starts at the reformatory, no one seems interested to investigate why and how it started, and why 7 people where almost burned alive. Why does it seem no one else supervises the reformatory aside the doctor? In episode 2 the director is shown, but later he's never mentioned. The doctor also seems to have too much power (able to fire guards and he's completely unsupervised). Why does that stay true after 2 lethal accidents and a fire that almost killed 7 people? Normally those events would definitely earn the attention of investigators and the director. \\n\\n\r\n After the fire, An-chan decides to come out of the infirmary early, again, for no apparent reason. He is put in with a few angry cell mates who where instructed to beat him to death overtime. He endures it. But after his friend gets hurt while trying to persuade them to take it out on him instead, he beats them all up at once, and threatens them so they won't blame him and the problem gets solved. The question arises - why the heck didn't he do that in the first place?\\n\\n\r\n When An-chan is made to starve, a good guard appears. Instead of talking to other guards and maybe filing a report, he goes against the doc and Ishihara, eventually getting killed (again, with no consequences, because its apparently easier to kill a guard than a prisoner. Another point - this man, who pretty much lost his life while trying to help the protagonists, got completely forgotten, and the boys didn't even once visit his grave). \\n\\n\r\n And finally, the escape. Everything would be ok about it if you have a very short memory, BUT, if you do remember back a little, an important detail gets left out (for the plot convenience, as usual). When Joe escaped, the director said that the police will be involved if he's not back in 48 hours. This time nothing like that was mentioned. So, was that not important in the first place? Or if it was, then the police surely got involved this time, so why was it not shown, and why was it fruitless?\\n\\n\r\n An-chan's death. It was ridiculous. There was so many problems with this event alone that its almost comical. First off - Ishihara shot the gun. He shot it a few times, NEAR A MILITARY BASE. Now i don't know what anyone thinks, but let me assure you, if something like that really happened, the guards would come running. Yet no one came (until later, when it serves the wanted plot... in reality - just in time to be court martialed for not doing their job), not after the shooting, and not after the motorcycle accident. An-chan didn't knock him out for some reason as well (though if you'd consider his character he WOULD do that much before he got stabbed). Now explain to me, if going back to see the boxing match was so important, why did he remember it just when it was convenient? Why not just knock out Ishihara? Why not knock him out after giving him the letter and he still came at him? And why remember to go back only when he's about to get killed, taking the knife out and walking menacingly towards armed men? I mean he above all else should have known that getting killed is the worst possible thing he can do to his friends... \\n\\n\r\n And what about the cops who decided to side with An-chan at the very end? What happened to the investigation of why he got killed? All the leads where there - Ishihara's finger prints on the gun, the man who called them and said he had the gun, and then lied to them and told them to shoot the wrong guy? Why was Ishihara not interrogated and put in prison/ mental facility? How did the doctor not get arrested over that, how did he leave the reformatory, and how on the earth some time later, he, being a DOCTOR tried running for a mayor? \\n\\n\r\n Later we have the \"revenge\". It was pretty good, BUT... Logically, it would be a pretty big scoop, leading to a major investigation. This would mean that Mario (and Turtle) would no longer have to be a fugitive if he simply turned himself in, and aided the investigation, explaining his circumstances. But he doesn't, because it seems logic and this anime are on a different wavelength.\\n\\n\r\n And finally we get to the last parts - the protagonist's arcs. First off - Mario. This is just a load of bull. A man in the bar where he is an assistant at, doesn't pay for the drink and assaults the owner, while breaking property. Mario then lets him hit himself twice before beating him up. Now what do we have here? 3 witnesses that saw the barman being assaulted, followed by Mario, who then applied self defense. 3 against 1! And he probably had a past of doing so in other bars too! Logically, he would be too afraid to even file a complain, because he's clearly at fault and there where 3 witnesses. Instead, the bar owner fires him because \"he dislikes this sort of thing\" (though the barman clearly likes him, and logically would help file a complaint), and Mario and Joe just keep quiet about it. The stupidity in this one is overwhelming. \\n\\n\r\n Instead, Soldier gets hurt trying to get the guy at fault to sign a document saying Mario is not at fault (instead of getting the asshole in jail and revoking his complaint that way)... All for nothing, because the judge is a moron, an aggressive one on top of it. Normally, the scoop from the doctor's arrest would be pretty much enough to explain everything, yet it seems they forgot that thing exists. Instead, Baremoto turns out to be a son of the judge's friend, and they get the girl to testify she was raped and that was the reason Mario got into the reformatory in the first place, so Mario leaves happily (despite all the stuff the judge told him, and even hit him)\\n\\n\r\n Next up is Joe. The logic fail is rather immense in this one, so i will explain it in depth. The problem here is when Joe is late to his concert, after almost getting killed, along with the woman who sponsored him in exchange for having sex with her. She is not portrayed as too bad of a character up to now, except making Joe lay with her to fulfill his dream. Yet after she fails to protect him, nearly gets him and herself killed and saved by his friends, instead of being shocked, or explaining Joe that its over for him (like you'd expect of her), suddenly, for no reason at all she starts to yell at him that he's a loser, its his fault for being late, and that he'll always stay scum... Just W T F . It was so frustrating to watch, not because i felt bad for Joe (at this pint i lost all emotional involvement and was torn between laughing my ass off or getting mad trying to understand wtf just happened), but because it was so horribly illogical and retarded.\\n\\n\r\n Baremoto. At the fire incident, he learned to trust his friends, and that they are the most important thing in the world for him. At his arc though, he falls for a prostitute, and forgets it all without a single hesitation. This is BS. Not as BS though as Turtle's arc, who we got led to believe was seriously ill because of being near and in the blast zone of a nuke, but then, suddenly, its all ok, and we forget all about it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this sums it up for the story problems, now for my other problems with this anime: \\n\\n\r\nNo soldier arc! \\n\r\nThe anime could use an extra ending and opening. \\n\r\nAnd finally, the characters are too immature and shounen like, while its supposed to be seinen. I also didn't expect there would be so much happy endings for everyone in it. Now don't get me wrong, Its not like i don't like happy endings.. But those look so forced, undeserved and unfitting. Not much gets resolved, after An-chan's death and revenge on their tormentors, the only problems are trivial stuff, arising from the boys being unable to deal with the real world. Yet they want to make it look like its just as dramatic and bad as everything else that happened before, and that feels as ridiculous as if a man who just literally escaped from hell itself with relative ease, suddenly broke down after being called a \"poopy face\" by a little kid.\\n\r\n*Edit* : Oh, and how could i forget? There's an extremely annoying narration going on, always pointing out the obvious and taking up extra time, not to mention the voice of the narrator is in itself pretty bad, like one you'd get in an old, self dubbed video in the 90's\\n\\n\r\nSo final verdict- the anime is not bad, but the story falls apart due to the infinite plot holes, inconsistency and logic fails, as well as the characters being unfit for the universe around them, and having pretty small issues in the second half compared to the first half of the show, leading to a fall in interest. Despite that 6 is usually a score i'd usually say is somewhat good, i would not really recommend this anime, as its major trait that is supposed to be the dark atmosphere and struggles of the protagonists is severely broken apart and comical if you have a long attention span and look at it critically.",

            "content": "What exactly is friendship? Are your friends more important to you than your family? What are you willing to go through for a friend? Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin (for the rest of the review the anime will be referred to simply as Rainbow) focuses on friendship, as well as several other themes based around friendship, such as humanity, morality, violence, love, family etc. This is my review:\r\nStory - Rainbow is a tale about seven inmates in a special reform school who grow closer with the increased time they spend together. All seven of them are there for committing several crimes which shaped these verydifferent yet very similar individuals. From the opening moments of the first episode right through to the last scene of the last episode I was hooked. The show grabbed me and forced me to sit down and watch what happened next. Rainbow is brutal, mature, dark and at times depressing. But I was surprised at how light the show can get at certain points, from the funny banter between the seven inmates to the way they overcome obstacles by relying on each other and their bond. The tone shifts from time to time but Rainbow manages to keep the shifts fluid and smooth. For me, Rainbow had two highlights, and the story was definitely one of them. The writing was well done because the show didn't come off as melodramatic and managed to feel really inspirational at certain points and there were more twists than one would expect from a show like this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - I mentioned that the show had two aspects that really stood out. The characters were the second aspect. These were really cool guys. They were bad ass but they were portrayed in such a sympathetic way that you would root for all of them, sort of like multi-layered anti-heroes. The story was really amazing but I really enjoyed seeing the guys react to the situations they found themselves in. Character driven stories always work when it's executed properly. Like I said their friendship is an intricate part of the story. It is tested time and time again. It's wonderful to see selfless friendship like the one showed here. If you have a best friend or an entire \"entourage\" that you'll take a bullet for you'll know what I'm talking about. Two characters took a back seat to the others sometimes but that didn't detract from how enjoyable Rainbow was.\\n\\n\r\nSound - The voice acting was fantastic with each character sounding like they ought to. It is a lot more difficult to illustrate chemistry between animated characters than live-action characters but once again Rainbow manages to pull it off. There are a couple of bonuses available in the form of short clips with some the show's voice actors and I must say I really found new respect for seiyuus. The OP is probably not for everyone. A heavy metal track will turn some off but in my opinion it fitted well with the tone and atmosphere of the show. Listen to it and you'll know what to expect. The rest of the OST wasn't very bad and after listening to \"A FAR OFF DISTANCE\" I just had to get it on my phone.\\n\\n\r\nArt - Rainbow's art is really good. I'm not an artist so I don't know how to explain it in detail but it's not too shabby. The art is very realistic like seinen should be. There are no alterations to characters' facial expressions for Japanese slapstick and like the voice acting, the art of each inmate fits to their personality and who they are.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - A part of me wishes that I didn't see Rainbow because after watching it, it'll be hard to find another series that will be able to top the standard Rainbow set. The story is brutal and violent, but also sincere and inspirational. The characters are extremely likeable and their relationship can get one emotional. Lump in throat emotional. The voice acting and soundtrack sound great and the art is beautiful. George Abe and Masumi Kakizaki really managed to create a distinctive style here.\\n\\n\r\nRainbow is a fantastic character driven story chronicling the lives of seven inmates who became best friends. The show is not for the weak of heart but please give it a try, you'll be surprised how much you love it. \\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nWho said anime was just for kids?\\n\\n",

            "content": "Rainbow : Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin - after watching episodes of this anime, one word kept coming to my mind. \"Beautiful\". This anime shows how beautiful friendship can be. Acts of selflessness, sacrificing oneself to help another, returning to that one special place - It's all present in Rainbow. It's a good mix of emotion, struggle and drama. Rainbow is one superb anime, regrettably, it's buried deep within the other numerous popular titles out there and I'm glad I found it(more like stumbled upon).\r\nStory? Rainbow focuses on seven teenagers who are found guilty of committing crimes and are sent to a Disciplinary school/Reformatory. In reality,it was Hellhole for them because they received very harsh treatment by some of the authorities to the point where they got thrashed by a group of hired thugs and received a lot of unnecessary punishment, though not all of the main characters suffered the same exact punishment. The story takes place in 1955, a decade after the end of the Second World War. During that time, Japan in it's state, still rebuilding its cities after the war and corruption is common. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of plot, it can be rather predictable sometimes. Characters' \"motives\" are predictable as ever too. What's very common in anime are that you can tell who's evil and who's not; Especially, when one of those anime characters who always had their eyes shut, suddenly they open their eyes and with a wide silly grin across their face obviously tells you that they are up to no good. It often shows that their intentions are usually bad too. But even with that, with lots of edge-of-seat action scenes, plenty of sorrowful moments, plot twists and memorable acts of friendship - Rainbow's overall storyline is top notch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter? Rainbow have a nice cast of main characters each with an interesting backstory. The seven protagonists of cell six each have their own unique personalities. Also, Character development is good. For example, Mario Minakami. In the start, He was weak and sometimes talks big but with help in the later episodes, he becomes a badass.  The MCs are initially hostile towards each other but soon after they start helping out they quickly become friends. My favourite character in the series is Sakuragi Rokurouta: a young man with a boxing talent. He's also the oldest, strongest and acts as the leader out of the seven. With all that, Sakuragi Rokurouta is a man worth respecting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound? The Opening theme is extremely good because I like these kind of songs: the Rock/Metal genre. Opening theme \"We're not alone\", sung in English by Japanese Band Coldrain was epic. Not only that the opening theme was awesome, but its also very fitting for the anime. The ending theme, wasn't entirely great, still I don't think its too bad. Also, whenever one of the protagonists gets serious, a distinct background music kicks in. Voice acting was brilliant but I find the English voice overs of the American characters sound a little weird.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Visuals? The overall visuals passable. I think the dark/gloomy art style and colors really does suit the anime. However, Viewers who constantly had been watching anime with bright visuals might find Rainbow's visuals repulsive. Amusingly, all the evil characters in the series look so hideous. Characters' hair colours are natural; colours that naturally exist in real life: black, dark brown, blonde, etc. No, I don't hate the colorful hair that exist in anime, but the natural hair colors  gives a more realistic feel.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion? Rainbow is an anime with an inspiring story and have many likeable characters. However, some people may find Rainbow's art style unappealing, but even you don't like that, you should at least give it a try. But for fans of thriller/Drama or anyone looking for a good anime of its genre, it's a must watch. \\n",

            "content": "'RAINBOW - The Seven from Cell 2-6' is about seven teens who spent time in same cell of Shounan Disciplinary School after committing separate juvenile crimes in 1955.\r\nThis series is one of the purest example of Japanese \"Yankee\" or \"Furyou\" (high school deliquent) Drama . Although prominent in Japanese films, this genre is extremely rare in recent anime series possibly due to lack of interest from typical otaku demographics and decline of furyou in Japan. As far as I know, 'Sakigake! Cromatie High School' being the only other one (and many other series in lesser extent, such as 'GTO' and 'Gokusen'). 'RAINBOW' is a hard-boiledfuryou drama in its purest form.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Character: 7.5/10\\n\r\n'RAINBOW' is a very character-driven series with at least two solid episodes dedicated to development of each cellmate.\\n\\n\r\nThe story start out a bit too fast and forces viewers to accept convenient plot developments. Typical furyou drama of this type would take about a quarter of the story to introduce the gang and better half of the screen time to establish the bond between each member. In 'RAINBOW', however, all seven are gathered in the very first episode with light introduction by the narrator, and immediately form a strong bond. By ep4, they've become inseparable friends with absolute trust.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough such rapid formation of trust is hard to swallow, it allows larger portion of the story to challenges and hardships that awaits them.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half is mainly about the seven's time spent in prison. As one would expect of a furyou drama, all the characters start as troublesome and selfish individuals until being united by a leader. That leader in this series is 'An-chan'. As a senior in the disciplinary school, he teaches his juniors true strength and importance of friendship as they overcome various hurdles and eventually \"graduate\" from the school and form new goals.\\n\\n\r\nWhereas most furyou drama end there, 'RAINBOW' continues on to the second half, tackling issues such delinquents will encounter in society beyond the protective environment of a school. They face corruption, discrimination, and exploitation by adults, but with the help of friends and hard work, they find new hopes.\\n\\n\r\nAll the main characters have distinct personalities and dark pasts, but all of them are either falsely convicted or had good reasons to commit their crimes. The story once again forces us to accept such convenient premise for plot development and melodrama.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in this series is very heavy and emotional draining, but at the same time, too convenient and ignores character motivations from time to time for the sake of drama. All characteristics of traditional drama in mid-1900s Japanese storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\r\nEvery episode begins with an explicit warning. While this series is nowhere near graphic as some other anime series I've encountered, this warning is very appropriate since this series faithfully follows traditional seishun/furyou anime qualities other than the violence.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected of Madhouse, artwork and character design successfully captures the gloomy and depressing atmosphere of the post-war Japan. Animation in general was nothing fancy, but consistent throughout the series and relatively pleasing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nThere was a lot of frozen manga sketch scenes to enhance drama. This is a signature technique in classic anime that worked very effectively in establishing retro atmosphere of this series.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, it lacked detail sometimes, but the atmosphere is great, and it's an excellent example of old style animation with modern improvements.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast did a great job, pretty much everyone sounded like they should and none sounded annoying at all. What's significant about the cast was that it uses many major Japanese actors as voice actors. Oguri Shun, who starred as the protagonist in furyou film and manga adaptation 'Crows ZERO' plays Mario. Waki Tomohiro, who starred in many movies and TV drama as a fat delinquent student plays Cabbage. Also a major actress Kanjiya Shihori as Setsuko.\\n\\n\r\nThe narration in this series by the veteran voice actress Hayashibara Megumi was absolutely phenomenal. Retro female narration voice in rough, delinquent talk further sets the atmosphere, and was a highlight of the series for me.\\n\\n\r\nBGM was sparingly used, but significantly added to drama and inspiration in crucial scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOP including the animation was amazing. I usually don't like foreign-language theme songs in Japanese shows, but it was fitting for the despair and toughness of the characters, and the opening animation in itself was exciting and had all the major qualities and symbolism of this series. ED, once again, is very retro Japan.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\n'RAINBOW' is one of those serious anime that's becoming increasingly rare in recent years. Like all furyou drama, it focuses on friendship and trust among friends, but it doesn't shy away from the the toughness of real life. It's a classic drama that depicts cruelty, corruption, sorrow, and eventually hope in depressing post-WWII Japan.\\n\\n\r\nThe story feel forced and melodramatic at times, but then again, that's pretty common classic Japanese storytelling. This is a series that really feels like you're watching a retro piece, but offer values that modern viewers can still relate to. As long as you allow yourself to connect with the characters, this will be a very enjoyable series.\\n\\n\r\nI feel this is the most neglected series of the season (ending Summer '10), and definitely a must-watch for serious anime viewers.",

            "content": "Rainbow starts off fine with an interesting concept (boys from post WWII) but this show could have been so much more if they really stuck to that principle. As stated early on, the author wanted to emphasize the coolness of his characters, and given that, it shows in how little this anime develops anything else.\r\nThe art aside from some violent scenes is pretty average, and it's generally made obvious who the antagonists are from the art style alone. Given that, it reduces the amount of surprise and suspense that the show has. Minor points for the art successfully making me hate the villains and findthe good guys...cooler though. If that was the purpose, at least it was consistent about that.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course the characters.  Certainly...they are cool, all of them featuring somewhat blindly noble ideals taught by their beloved Anchan. Unfortunately character development isn't as strong as it should be. Even after a few years pass, all the characters in this show remain pretty much the same, and never really grow out of their flaws. However Mario's changes in becoming a carbon copy of Anchan basically flashes the word \"cliche\" in bright red bold letters. During the last half of the show, some time is spent to supposedly go into detail what the characters to to make a living, except for Soldier unfortunately, and the transition from character arc to character arc is very abrupt, assuming that you will understand what is going on from watching the introduction of all the characters. Each of these arcs unfortunately is plagued by use of the same cliche devices - a repetition of the story about how friendship wins everything - and I find that gets boring at a certain point.\\n\\n\r\nRainbow looked interesting when it was first released, and don't get me wrong, I found it moderately entertaining. However I will be clear that this show is just average at best. It falls into too many cliche patterns and fails to actually go more in depth about its original draw to attention; this show should have done more work in portraying the problems of post WWII life. That I believe is the reason why most people including myself watched this show in the first place.",

            "content": "Rainbow is one of those precious gems that get lost among the popular action/romance/silly anime, that happen to air at the same time. At first glance, it might seem as a well-worn drama set in an after-all dramatic post-war period. That 's what I thought. And I regret that thinking.. One episode was more than enough to captivate me..What is exceptionnal about this show, is the great deliverance of emotions. With no exaggerations or deficiencies, the emotions are there, the way they should be.. You 'll find yourself cry - be it of joy or of sorrow-, get angry, anticipate anxiously and share the samehopes with the characters.\\n\r\nLet me say first that this review is my very first, so please bear with me and pardon any mistakes..\\n\\n\r\n~Plot 9/10~\\n\r\nThe story follows the lives of 7 teenagers, who have been placed in a reformatory for minor crimes. That's where they all meet and where their journey of life begins. Their daily humiliation and suffering are presented through intense realistic scenes, that make you feel uneasy, as well as a wonderful narration. In this rotten prison, where every single thing seems corrupted,the 7 boys discover the true meaning of friendship, self-sacrifice, hope and solidarity. But, of-course, not in the easy way.. Pretty much, this is the story. You definitely have seen it before, but not this well developed.\\n\r\nAn important thing, that you should know is that the story is somehow divided in two parts. I cannnot explain more because it would be a spoiler, and i wouldn't want to \"spoil\" you. I can only say that the critical point is episode 14.\\n\r\nThe first part , in my opinion, was much better than the second one, in terms of suspense and anxiety. The second part, is interesting enough, but kind of more predictable and cliched.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters 9/10~\\n\r\nThe characthers is the strong point of this show. Each one chased by his own demons, tries to fight for his life but never forgetting his friends, who come above all. Every character is unique and has his own secrets and dreams, but they all share the same love for one another. However, some characters are more highlighted, thus more likeable. Generally, the characters are nice but sometimes TOO nice, to the point where you feel like watching saints. \\n\\n\r\n~Art 8/10~\\n\r\nThe art is , for my tastes, mediocre. Some characters are drawn very nicely but others are really messed up. Especially the villains. They are actually quite creepy..Overall, I think that the art is great for this show, where you don't expect hot guys or fancy backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound 8/10~\\n\r\nThe music is another element that is very carefully done in this show. It embodies and amplifies the emotions. The opening and the ending songs are good, not exceptionnal. The voice actors, also, do a great job.\\n\\n\r\nSO TO SUM UP...\\n\\n\r\nWhy to watch??\\n\r\nBecause you like dramas, uncensored violent scenes, disturbing truths, secret pasts, the feeling of justice being delivered, the journey of life with its good and bad, life and death situations, friendship between men, disgusting villains, unpredictable twists on the plot and many other things that you'll discover if you watch it..\\n\\n\r\nWhy NOT to watch??\\n\r\nI can't handle violence, I don't like men crying, heavy drama, too much injustice. Right now, I can't think of anything else..\\n\\n\r\nI hope I helped you. Personally, I would recommend it to anyone. Even if it isn't your thing, just watch the first episode. You won't lose anything..\\n",

            "content": "If I was to sum up the entire series so far in two words, it would be these: simply amazing.\r\nStory: 10\r\nThis story is definitely one of the best I have seen so far in an anime. It follows the story of seven young men who are put in a school called the Sh\u014dnan Special Reform School, which is basically just a prison. They don't know anything about each other at first but eventually they grow closer and form a bond that is so strong it can never be broken.\r\nArt: 9\r\nThe art in Rainbow is decent. Nothing spectacular but nothing to complain about. The animation isfluid and everything is easy to see. Unlike many anime there are no chibi/joke scenes. The majority of the scenes are darker due to the general atmosphere of the show. The reason I gave it a 9 is that the show is very grainy, which is more or less a matter of preference.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are very good. The opening is completely in English while the ending features both Japanese and English. They both do an excellent job of conveying the message of bonds and not giving up, which showcases the show's values perfectly. The show itself doesn't have a lot of music but when there is music it does a good job of capturing the mood.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Rainbow are excellent. They all have very different personalities and they all gradually change over time. Not just the protagonists, but even the antagonists are very well developed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis show is really a must-see, there isn't much like it in the world of anime. Some of you might be reluctant to pick up Rainbow like I was, since it doesn't exactly look like the best show in the world on the outside. However, trust me, watch an episode or two, and you'll know exactly when I'm talking about. You'll be glad that you did.",

            "content": "\"No matter how tired you are, or how much punishment you take, look into his eyes. Never look down.\"\r\nWhen I read the description for Rainbow, I knew I'd have to watch it. A story of a circle of friends being forged under the anvil of the Japanese disciplinary school system...sounds like an awesome \u201cfor men\u201d type story, right? Well, as I quickly found out, Rainbow bites off way more than it can chew, and in the end its execution does not keep up with its ambitious ideas. It is still a fairly engrossing and entertaining series, but \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d this ain't.\r\nRainbow begins with sixteenage criminals being taken by bus to a reform school. We're informed that the year is 1955. I guess in Japan in 1955 \u201creform school\u201d basically meant \u201cmaximum security prison for kids,\u201d because this place has the works\u2014armed guards, high walls, and lots of cells. A guard leads the six boys to their holding cell, and it's there that the six newcomers meet Rokurouta Sakuragi, an ex-boxer and two year veteran of the reform school. Sakuragi earns the respect of the boys by easily beating all of them in a six-on-one fight. When a sadistic guard enters the cell and offers to let the boys beat Sakuragi with a wooden club as punishment, they gain Sakuragi's respect by steadfastly refusing the demands of the guard. Afterward, Sakuragi takes the six boys under his wing, teaching them the ropes of survival in the harsh world of the reform school. We later learn that the aforementioned guard has an obsessive vendetta against Sakuragi, and the boys engage in a dangerous game of cat and mouse against this guard and the prison's administrators, with Sakuragi protecting the boys and the boys protecting Sakuragi.\\n\\n\r\nWhew. That's one heck of a plot, and it does have a certain crazed momentum and intensity to it. It's the kind of show where, at the end of an episode, you'll want to immediately watch the next one, and that's a feat in and of itself. However, there are sacrifices made to maintain this rapid pacing. The show really skips a lot of development that would have been necessary to fully flesh out the cast of characters. For example, between the first and second episodes, we're informed that a month has passed, and that the boys have become good friends in this time. I would have rather seen them become friends than simply be told that they've become friends; you really have to suspend your sense of disbelief to honestly feel like anyone could develop live-saving bonds of friendship in the period of time allotted in this series. The show makes this tradeoff of character development for plot speed on several occasions, and the end result is that, while I thought this was going to be a dark and mature prison drama about friendship under the worst of circumstances, it sort of ends up being a prison thriller where friendship is just a convenient device used to explain the plot's direction (Q: \u201cWhy did this event happen?\u201d A: \u201cFRIENDSHIP, MAN\u201d). \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of explaining plot direction, there is one aspect of this show that annoyed me more than any other: The narrator. This show has a female narrator (who you might recognize as the voice of Rei from Evangelion) who occasionally interjects to make inane and obvious observations about what's going on. The end result is similar to watching an action movie with your stupid friend who likes to point out everything that happens. For example, let's say there's a scene where the boys get brutally beaten by the guards. The show will then pause on a still frame of the boys dispirited faces, and the narrator will say something like \u201cOn that day, the boys were once again dispirited by the brutal beatings of the guards.\u201d If that seems redundant to you, that's because it is. Narration of this type does not tell me anything that I could not have learned by watching, and really serves no purpose whatsoever. It's not even an issue of \u201cshow, don't tell.\u201d It's an issue of \u201cyou already showed me this, you do not need to tell me it too.\u201d Three episodes into the series, I was tired of hearing the narrator talk, and every time she does, the show falters just a little bit more.\\n\\n\r\nRainbow's animation is a product of Madhouse, so you pretty much know it's going to look good. Every character design is unique in its own right, and while it's tough to make a world of gray appealing, they pull it off. Sequences of action (fistfights being the most common example) are smoothly and lovingly animated. Can't say much about this other than that it's a job well done, although one thing that I really must comment on is the occasional absurdity of the art and animation during scenes of emotion. I wish I could insert a screenshot of one of the characters crying to accompany this comment; it literally looks like characters spew thick, viscous tears from every bodily orifice. \\n\\n\r\nRainbow's soundtrack is unusually mixed, and strangely appropriate. There are upbeat rock/jazz numbers for the many moments of inspirational bro-love, atmospheric pieces for dark scenes of prison violence, and the obligatory sad orchestral songs for those would-be tearjerk moments. The show opens with a fast-paced metalcore song that I initially thought was ludicrously out of place, but eventually I warmed to it. It ends on a more tender note with a slower pop song. All in all, pretty well-chosen music.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, if you're looking for something that offers a mature take on serious issues, my personal opinion is that RAINBOW just isn't it. It's a fast-paced, plot-focused, action-heavy show that's been poorly disguised as a character-driven drama, and while the characters don't fall entirely flat, I'd say most of them are only a step or two above it. But it is a well-plotted series, and survives on suspense and visceral momentum that are uncommon today. In terms of sheer entertainment, Rainbow is a winner. Its failings are purely in the theme and character departments.",

They are not in the present, and the present is where everything begins.\" - Carlos Santana.\r\nDealing with the past is not easy especially when you commit something terrible. Say, a crime. Then, you think about the future but that little hope is so far away because where you are now is somewhere that you never want to be: prison. Trapped like a caged bird and nowhere to go, nowhere to run, your future is about to go down the drain faster than the rain pouring outside. This is what happens whenyou commit a crime. This is what happens when you disobey the law. This is what happens in Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I finished the series Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin over a rainy weekend. It's funny too since Coldrain also sings the OP song and this story is anything but hot. It is cold. It is thrilling. It is emotional and it throws drama right into your face with a boxing punch.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say that this is one of the most underrated series I've seen in awhile. From the first episode, I was intrigued by possibly just the first 10 minutes. Now, I'm a bit fan of prison like theme and at first, it felt like watching Deadman Wonderland which I did enjoy also. Long thought cut short, this series creates a touching story, a story of emotional drama and psychological thriller. This series pushes violence in the RIGHT way unlike some series that has just presents unnecessary gore every 5 minutes. This anime did not make that mistake, at least from my point of view.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the series presented involves the prison style and what it is like to feel the guilt after committing a crime. It makes you feel the realism and the severe consequences of committing a bad deed. And of course in prison, there are prisoners and wardens. Unfortunately for our protagonists, they are not on good terms with a few particular characters namely Ishihara. He is one of the most sadistic characters in the series and I think most people (including myself) would probably want to beat him half to death after watching the first half.\\n\\n\r\nBut not all is gloom and doom because there are also characters that sparks light into that cave of darkness. That light would definitely be Sakuragi for his way of protecting the others after an emotional drama that left him scars. He is very driven to protecting what he believes is right and those are his friends. He can be pushed to his own physical limit by Ishihara but when faced with seeing his precious friends suffering, his rage reaches a boiling point where he disregards his own safety. Now, I found that to be truly inspiring. The other characters of the series are also quite interesting ranging their past and history involving the dark mood of the story. Such an example would be Mario. He is also noticeable in the series as one of the main characters. At first, he gets into an intense fight with Sakurgai but later on views him as a close brother figure and inspires to be like him. His character development in seen as one of the major points of the series and after watching him develop was quite an interesting turn throughout the progressing episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, I loved the execution as well as its performance and thought this series lived up to its expectations. Not that it's any surprising anyways since one of my studios, Madhouse is involved. The art is performed spectacular and darkens the mood of the story. Throughout the episodes, there are manga like sketches that conveys the mood the story and through the narrator dialogue covers the background. It captures the sense and style and I really enjoyed its unique performance. Additionally, there are scars that portrays not only the physical but mental manifestations that drove some characters to become what they are. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP song of this series is also quite catchy even though I'm not familiar with the band. I tend to skip a lot of OP songs but didn't let a go pass on this one. Why would I anyways when it's so damn catchy? Good job Coldrain, kudos to you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, my enjoyment of this series was decent and did not feel like a waste of time. There were hardly any cliches I've found and the driven characters' development of the story from hopelessness to a better future makes me want to learn about them more and more. This series is not an anime that should be dropped from the first few episodes (as I'm sure some people have). Instead, concentrate on the dark setting of the story and its driven characters. Concentrate on the realism and the reality of being sent to prison after committing a bad deed. Why? Because crime is real and the consequences are there. That little hope is still there though because after a long pouring weekend, a rainbow does shine into the sky. That rainbow represents hope, a hope for a better future. Have hope in yourself and concentrate instead on the present. Like the song by Coldrain and lyrics says:\\n\\n\r\nWe are not alone.",

            "content": "Friendship is an extremely common theme in anime (in any medium for that matter) but rarely is it portrayed in hell. Set in a crippled 1950's Japan, Rainbow thrusts its seven protagonists into a juvenile refinement center, which is essentially a youth prison filled with guards who are out for blood. They give each other nicknames, befriend each other over a smoke, and carve their dreams on a tree for when they're finally free, and agree to meet there once again in the future.\r\nIt is a very gripping story and throughout the series you as the audience will be kept on your seat almostconstantly. The atmosphere is always extremely tense, and this is in-part due to the brilliant presentation. There are a lot of sombre guitar-based musical pieces, which are not anything particularly memorable on their own, but blend in with the material very nicely. The opening and ending are phenomenal scores though, the opening highlighting the brutal conditions in tone and lyrics and the ending contrasting it with a cold, melancholic feel. Both songs have phenomenal vocals as well.\\n\\n\r\nNot only is the animation fluent, but Rainbow also has a great usage of framing and angling. The show even utilizes bright, high-detail still frames without feeling cheap due to how infrequent they appear and how well they contrast and compliment the usual artwork of the show. During the first half of the show, the colour palette is mostly grey, which really brings out the dreariness of the setting. Couple this with the vivid redness of the blood and you yourself have a very grim experience. The boys are almost always in peril, and face very harsh consequences for their actions, some of which last a lifetime. This brutal reality only makes the catharsis that much more satisfying when the boys do succeed, creating a very exhilarating watch.\\n\\n\r\nBut as ruthless the show is, it lacks all subtlety. Along with most of the show's antagonists, Ishihara, the guard in charge of our cast's cell, is drawn very grotesquely to accentuate his sadism, and looks very unrealistic compared to the grittiness of the other characters. This is pretty unnecessary considering the extent of Ishihara's character is his sadism alone. Even the other antagonists, such as the pedophilic doctor Sasaki, are all very one-dimensional, and merely serve as villains for the sake of being villains. \\n\r\nThe protagonists are not that complex either. The seven boys all have a few traits to make them stand out, and while they develop nicely throughout the show, they don\u2019t have that much to them. Soldier and Cabbage are completely expendable and exist solely to have muscle and comic relief respectively. Sakuragi, the eldest, is a very stoic man, but cares for his friends deeply, and while this makes him likable, it doesn't make him all that memorable.\\n\\n\r\nRainbow is somewhat imbalanced in the way that it treats its characters. During the first half, most of the cast is given sob-story back-stories to make the audience care about them rather than actually developing them and their relationship. In this case, said victimization works, but it is still a cheap tactic. The back-stories can be quite melodramatic, but given the setting, and the fact that many criminals have childhood trauma, they rarely feel implausible, or as some may say, edgy. I really wish that the characters had been fleshed out more in the beginning as it would\u2019ve made the audience\u2019s care for them that much more genuine.\\n\\n\r\nIt is only during the second half, which takes place outside the prison, in which character dynamics are fully explored. The show handles this switch from thriller to slice of life very well, which is quite difficult to pull off. Albeit without some of the intensity, the characters\u2019 interpersonal problems are just as entertaining as the threats to their life in part one. Turtle and Uncovered are probably the best characters of the bunch. Turtle's charisma and sly, con-man nature always steals the spotlight, while Uncovered is a flawed but good-natured man which makes him very easy to relate to. Joe's dreams of becoming a singer are handled in a realistic manner as well, as he faces many bumps in the road, and his story proves that becoming a superstar is certainly no easy task. But no matter how tough it gets, Joe presses on, which displays a lot of growth in his character.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, all of the characters mature quite believable and subtly, which is something the show deserves a lot of credit for. This passage of time is most evident in Mario. He begins as an irrational boy, and idolizes Sakuragi to the point of taking up boxing, something Sakuragi loves. Eventually he develops a strong relationship with Setsuko, which forces him to grow and become his own man rather than just mirror Sakuragi.\\n\\n\r\nAll of these elements come together and create a very entertaining and down-to-earth story, although there are many small narrative inconsistencies littered throughout the show. For example, there is a scene in which one character is walking around in an atomic bomb site moments after it was detonated, when he should clearly have died due to radiation poisoning. Or another time when the cast managed to track down a woman across the country none of them knew the whereabouts to (or had any prior connections to) within a matter of days. This is the 1950's; such a task would be near impossible in such a short amount of time. Alone, these issues are fairly minor, but compounded they become very damaging to the immersion of the series.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest complaint is an extremely irrational and stupid decision made by Sakuragi around the halfway point. His blatant ignorance regarding almost all of the characters in the show almost cost his friends in prison their lives, if not for a convenience in the plot. But at the end of the day, none of these gripes destroy the experience completely, and the show still feels grounded enough to display its themes cohesively; and the main theme of Rainbow is friendship.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I wish the show would have spent more time developing their friendship throughout the earlier sections of the show, (as they go from strangers to eternal companions in just two episodes) Rainbow nails its thematic execution regarding the importance of camaraderie. The way the characters act so genuinely selfless towards one another is truly inspiring, and while the dialogue can sometimes feel unnatural or ham-fisted, the cast's actions speak far louder than their words. Everyone really needs each other to survive, inside the prison or out, and Rainbow displays this while still firmly grounded in reality.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is a mixed bag and the narrative can be very inconsistent but the brisk pacing and tense atmosphere keep excitement high while the subtext is powerful enough to linger in one\u2019s mind for months. Rainbow isn\u2019t something revolutionary, but it is a unique experience, so I can recommend it as something to be backlogged, and not necessarily watched right away.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The problem with ourselves right now is we usually too arrogant and easily judged anime just by seeing the cover. Without watching or see it, we can easily bashed and even judge the anime before even giving it a shot. Many covers in anime sometimes didnt really represent on whats gonna happen in the anime itself, Like Rainbow : Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin.\r\nSTORY \r\nWhats in your mind after seeing the cover? I can easily guess that you're gonna think this anime is about in prison and full of action. Well, thats 30% right. But, thats not all. Taking place after World War II, The storyin this anime was about 7 prisoners that must struggle to live in prison and how they dealt with it and they follows their life together and how they move on afterwards. Quite attracting, if i could said after hearing the premise.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself brings the manly, GAR and friendship themes. In this anime you can find many tearful, and moments about the bonds within the  prisoners but at the sametime its still GAR and manly. Confused? Well, it cant  helped. Usually, GAR or manly themes is always about gore, action, blood, and any violences act like in Berserk. But in Rainbow, that stereotypes is banished. Manly and GAR that i said in this anime was more about melancholic manly themes. If you ever have \"Manly tears were shed\" then this anime have A LOT of scenes that will makes you saying that. Well,it cant be helped since in this anime they more into explicit scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThis friendship theme in Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin is not like any friendship themes that shounen anime always brings which is always cliche and sometimes unlogical. In rainbow, its more darker and more realistic. Like sometimes they must betray their friends for their selfish goals and at the sametime, they must sacrifice themselves for someone who is called \"friends\".\\n\\n\r\nThis anime successfully execute and represent about the friendship bonds between men. Sometimes, some anime crossess the line between friendship and bromance but in Rainbow, you dont need to afraid. This anime purely about friendship and how they help each other within them even helping to get a girl. Again, Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin will bring you a friendship and manly story that you wouldnt have imagined before.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nMadhouse, who didnt know this studio producer? known for BECK, Black Lagoon, Death Note, and many other famous anime. They continued make an awesome anime like this anime Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin, Madhouse never let you down in anything,They have their own standard like in the art. The art in this anime is more into realistic type which is really suitable with the story, The background is quite detailed like in the prison. Its so dark and they use plain color to present \"depressing and how boring\" that lives in prison. For me, Its quite close like the real prison that usually have a heavy atmosphere and not-so-comfortable place.and  Rainbow is successfully make the viewers feels like in the real prison.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nWell, the OP in this anime was make this anime more epic. \"We're not alone\" singing by coldrain is really represent with this anime. This rock band who formed in Nagoya , is rarely make a song for anime. They (until now) just make song for 2 anime, Hajime no Ippo and Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin. But that doesnt mean this band have bad quality or like that, just hear the OP in Rainbow, the rock song is really suitable with anime that have manly themes and more the lyrics is seems have a connection in this anime like \"There's a place in this world where hope and dream are not yet lost\", Well, prison is a place where hope and dreams are lost. Summary, Not just hearable, and catchy the OP song in this anime have a meaningful lyric that connects with the anime itself which makes the song being more epic.\\n\\n\r\nFor the seiyuu, you wouldnt find any famous seiyuus in nowdays like Hanazawa Kana or maybe Mamoru Miyano (Well, but you will find several seiyuu from old generations like Rikitya Koyama whose voiced Kogoro (Detective Conan)) and i predict  you will guess the voice will be terrible and not really worthy, Well you're wrong guys. Again, dont judge anime by its covers, seiyuu, or anything else. This what shines the most. Every seiyuu is really suitable with the character which is their voiced. Non-famous seiyuus doesnt mean havent a quality, sometimes they can be a little diamond in amount of a lot famous seiyuu out there. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nThe character is what make Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin shines the most. In this one, you will find 7 men which have their own uniqueness. At the first, they being portrayed in this anime as the criminals but as long as the story goes you will find this \"criminals\" have their own reason why they do commit crimes and not just that, within 26 episodes you will see many epic, tearful moments with them. Also you will see how each characters struggle for achieving their own dreams. In this anime, the 7 men have their own unique dreams, like Mario who wanted to be a boxer or Mansuka Matsuura who wanted to eat good food everytime and What makes this anime is more fascinating is the character development. From relationship to the personality, you will see many developments in here and that what makes this anime so appealing.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\r\nSometimes i always wonder, why good anime like this have so few viewers than any sh*tful anime. Maybe because this anime doesnt have moe characters or ecchi scenes (maybe). But, for me seeing this masterpiece anime which just have a few viewers make me excited. Its like finding a hidden gem. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, if you're looking for manly but at the sametime touchy, then this anime is really for you. You will get GAR feeling but at the sametime you will have heartwarming feeling.and one more thing, this anime have so many tearjerker scenes. So prepare some tissues.\\n",

It begins with basically going over most of the past of the prisoners. It is nice to get some backstory of the supporting characters but gets tedious eventually. Mostly because they keep repeating about how they're all brothers and they all love each other. The meaning of those words lose strength when its brought up every single episode... As if the audience is too dumb to remember something that simple. Regardless it was cool to see them all united against the prisonguard and aggressive inmates. ( Taking beatings for each other ) This is not where the main problem is located.\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler:\\n\\n\r\n    The main problem that absolutely annihilates the whole show is episode 12. On Ep12, Ishihara ( Prison guard ) goes out of his way to attempt to kill sakuragi for always defying him. Ishihara has an obsession with sakuragi that goes beyond being a prisoner, because sakuragi makes him feel powerless. \\n\r\nWhen sakuragi was spotted on the outside world, ishihara wanted to pay him a visit. At this point ishihara had become a full on drug addict and completely lost his sanity. He had nothing to live for except killing sakuragi for who he accuses of ruining his life. \\n\r\nCue the stupidity. Ishihara confronts sakuragi and confesses his hate for him like many times before. Once ishihara is done monologuing, he pulls a gun on sakuragi with the intent to kill. Sakuragi saw this coming and disarms him. He now has the option of killing ishihara but doesnt because... well it would make him as bad as ishihara? It is never explained why he didnt. Sakuragi just continues to walk away and let ishihara attempt to kill him TWO MORE TIMES. The final being ishihara pulling a knife and stabbing him in the stomach. For some reason sakuragi didnt predict this like the other two times. Even though he should logically know ishihara would try to kill him again unlike the first time he pulled a gun. Anyways ishihara pulls the knife out like an idiot and continues to ignore ishihara and keep moving forward. American Military police stop sakuragi and tell him to drop the knife. He ignores this and keeps walking for ABSOLUTELY NO REASON. Sakuragi forces the police to kill him in the most forced death scene I have ever seen in anime. All sakuragi wanted was to get back to see the boxing event that his friend was fighting in. But instead of just killing ishihara or at least knocking him unconscious; he thinks its just a better idea to commit suicide. The only thing I can think of for not doing this is apparently sakuragi defines a \" man \" as someone that takes beatings. \\n\r\nYep getting his ass beat and never fighting back to defend yourself is what being a man is. Its only ok to beat up people if they attack your loved ones according to sakuragi.\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely ruined the anime, there is really no point in watching this clown fiesta.",

            "content": "Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin. This anime goes into the dark theme of seven teenagers forced to suffer for their crimes in a detention facility just after the WWII. The story follows these seven teenagers in trying to survive the cruelty of the warden and the detention center in general. The story progression may be a bit slow at times but it surely delivers. Story: 8/10\r\nThe theme of the art is generally dark which makes perfect sense for what it is trying to portray. The animation is superb and the style is very suiting. Art: 9/10\r\nThe sound, even though nothing too unique or amazing, waspretty enjoyable to say the least. Most of the soundtracks were suited for the occasion and used very well. Sound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the best part of this anime are the characters and character development. In terms of side-characters it may have been sub-par as side-characters weren't given too much attention and development. However, it more than made up for this fault by the development and illustration of the main characters, which there were seven of. As these characters are made to be real life like, you can relate to each one and would generally take a liking to most, if not all, of them. In terms of main characters, this anime does it especially well. Character: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of enjoyment, Rainbow certainly succeeded to keep me entertained throughout the series. It manages well to play well with your emotions where you would find yourself smiling whenever something pleasant happens, angered or sorrowed whenever during a woeful moment and sitting on the edge of your seat for the most part. Enjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend this anime? Yes, definitely a must-watch. Overall: 8.4/10",

Yet.....aren't we even allowed to dream'\r\nGrowing up and living in an environment where a struggle is present every moment of your life can only take a toll on ones psyche. You have no friends and  either have no family or, the family you have are troubled or distant from what they previously were. The only way to survive is by trusting no one but yourself as past experiences have dictated your innate perception of people. They are selfish and only get by; by looking out for themselves. Hate breeds hate, loneliness too does the same. This is theenvironment and setting of 'Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin 'or 'The Criminal Seven of Compound Two , Cell Six'.\\n\\n\r\nFor me this series had everything an anime enthusiast could ask for; a gripping story, character development and the right mixture of genres encompassing the life and times of the cast. This series on completion left me wanting more but, also gave utmost satisfaction at where it finished. Like any good series it grabbed me within the first episode. For me beginning a new series at times can be daunting as a number of them take a while to get into. Rainbow on the other hand excelled at the opposite. I was hooked!\\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoy the opening and ending themes of a series as they begin and end your viewing of an episode/series. Both themes were amazing and portrayed the themes and symbols of the series. 'We're not alone' by Coldrain starts the episode; the lyrics of the song encompass what those of the cast should be realizing. That you are not alone in this world and by standing together anything is possible. The ending is 'A far off distance' by Galneryus which is a reflective and a guitar wrenching powerballad showing the struggle and promise the cast have in life.\\n\\n\r\nTo keep me from rambling on i will be straight too the point with the remainder of the review.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was heartfelt, a tear jerker but at times it could be said a little too over emotional. However, looking back and taking all factors into account this was needed to show the effect that ones values can have on their life. For me the biggest let down of this anime in which everything was a 10/10, was the story as I longed for more. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound and Art will classed under Animetography; which i believe was one of the best aspects of the series. The detail in the facial expressions of the characters and settings would have to be up there with the best of series. As a viewer it really gave me a feel of the life the cast lived. The use of still  shots was also a key upside to this anime as it created a lasting impression something that at times would playback to you throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was fantastic encompassing mood perfectly and really setting the bar in terms of tempo and speed the anime progressed in. Overall both a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nKoyama Rikiya lead the cast of the series and showed why in my eyes he is one of the best in the business. Possibly some of the best voice actors i have heard take part in this series and really encompass what are individual brings to the table. Yet again 10/10\\n\\n\r\nImpression or enjoyment was also a 10/10. Like i said earlier the only let down was the anime actually ending.\\n\\n\r\nAs anime watchers i implore you to watch this series as it is one of the best stories to have come out of Japan in recent years. A tale of friendship and a never give up lifestyle encompass the series. Without giving detail or providing spoilers to the series i hope this persuades you into watching and getting your friends to watch as well. One of the key things about this anime is the lack of awareness people have to it.\\n\\n\r\n'We all wish to fly freely in the sky'",

            "content": "In the aftermath of the most devastating war in history, inside a reformatory, an unbreakable friendship is born between seven children.\r\nThere probably aren't many anime that can depict a friendship between a group of men as good as Rainbow. This group of friends will try to survive to a very harsh environment, and their friendship will prove to be their biggest weapon.\r\nIn the 50s, Japan was really in a very poor state because of World War II, and this anime makes it a goal to really show the viewers a bit of how things were back then; how much injustice was all over and howhuman rights were violated daily, specially in a place like a reformatory. It was a hard life, and many people suffered a lot.\\n\\n\r\nOur characters are challenged by many difficulties, which of course, included the relation between them sometimes, but everything will end up making their ties stronger. Prison is, obviously, not a friendly place, and many thing will happen in there to make our main characters act in extreme ways.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an engaging series from the first moment. If you like it, you will probably get hooked immediately and until the end, making this a very enjoyable series.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is also a very big element here, and it's played beautifully, from the opening to the ending, going through some great insert songs and a glorious BGM consisting in various tunes. You can expect great things when you have Masafumi Mima as sound director (Full Metal Alchemist, NANA, Shingeki no Kyojin, among many).\\n\\n\r\nIf you like what we commonly refer to as GAR (very manly characters), you're coming to the right place, as many of our characters being great examples of it, specially Rokurouta Sakuragi, who is very well voiced by Rikiya Komaya (Kiritsugu in Fate/Zero, Kogoro from Detective Conan, Takamura from Hajime no Ippo), and is probably one of the finest examples of \"GAR\" you'll ever find.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is really good throughout the whole series, with Madhouse doing an extremely good job in pretty much every aspect of the anime. There are some cruel things shown, because, just like Madhouse makes it clear at the start of every episode, they really want to portray the atmosphere of that period.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is basically divided in two halves divided but a timeskip, with the first half being the clear superior one, but with the second one still being pretty solid.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half is mainly about the life of this group inside the reformatory and about how they forge such a great bond. The second half is more about their life after the reformatory, and how that friendship proves to be something unbreakable.\\n\\n\r\nBiggest problem in this anime would be the antagonists, who are guys that are so evil, that they really aren't that believable as characters, even if their reasons were actually pretty common in places like that. They're there to be hated, and they make them very \"hateable\"... to a fault.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime pretty hard to dislike, as it is pretty solid in every aspect, and maybe you can even get to learn a little bit about what is to be in a place that was devastated by war.\\n\\n\r\nMadhouse is already a studio full of great works, and Rainbow is among the very best of them.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Rainbow really is an anime of two halves. There is a tonal shift that happens about halfway through that completely changes the feel and the quality of the story. This is not a good thing in my opinion. Lets look at each half and assess its quality.\r\nThe story starts out in post-war Japan with a bunch of young delinquents being stuck in the same jail cell of a reformatory for young men. This half of the anime concentrates solely on the boys being subjected to some absolutely horrific treatment by the warden and one particular guard, whilst looking for an opportunity to escape. Now fairwarning, this portion of the story is REALLY DARK. Holy shit, it might be some of the darkest, most effed up stuff Ive ever seen in an anime!!! Without going into detail, it involves regular beatings, child rape, torture, and eventually straight up attempted murder. And the villains are portrayed in the most mindlessly evil way possible: by this i mean the way they're animated as snarling drooling demons basically, with no actual motivation for their actions other than \"these guys are are just pure evil\". In fact the vast majority of adults in Rainbow are portrayed as evil....so while some elements of the story feel faithful to the place and time, the portrayal of people is very cartoony, with little motivation for their actions. Basically, the young guys are good, the bad guys are pure evil. What im trying to get across is that Rainbow is not a subtle anime at all. Nevertheless, the first half is powerful, as we see these boy's friendship strengthen through their shared adversity. It feels a lot like \"Shawshank Redemption\" in this regard. \\n\\n\r\nNow, without spoiling it too much, eventually the boys leave the reformatory and try to make their way in the real world. This is basically the storyline for the entire second half of the series. This is where Rainbow falls flat in my opinion. The tone of the series changes drastically, with a lot more light hearted feel. Dont worry, there's still lots of beatings, just less paedophiles and kiddy rape. The leader of the boys ***SPOILER*** gets killed (in an absolutely ridiculous way it must be said), and this prompts each of the boys to decide what they want to do with their future. Now this sounds ok on paper, but the execution is so over the top dramatic and unrealistic it really makes your eyes roll. To give an example, one of the boys wants to become a singer. Fair enough, nothing wrong with that. However, the band he is apprenticing for decide for some reason that because he wants to become a singer he is their competition and that they must teach him a lesson by beating the crap out of him, threatening to pour mercury down his throat, and eventually trying to murder him. For absolutely NO REASON. Its contrived drama that just would never happen in real life. This is the over the top ridiculous cartoony tone of the series second half,and i feel it really suffers from this inept writing.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is generally and consistently really nice, to its credit it rarely looks low budget. Sound is also pretty good, and its got a killer opening theme song by Coldrain (reminiscent of Hunter x Hunter's epic metalcore opening). \\n\\n\r\nThose that applaud Rainbow as masterpiece are simply way off the mark. It explores some dark, horrific themes, that do reflect the hard times of post war Japan. But instead of a realistic portrayal, they went for over the top drama and torture porn. Basically its content is meant to shock, not to make a thought provoking point.",

Rainbow is truly an underrated gem that I happen to stumble upon and I was really amazed of how well everything is made in this anime and how well it showed the values of love, friendship and hope is very important in life.\r\nStory-10\r\nThe story is about teens who were sent to a detention facility where they meet a fellow inmate who changed they're lives for the better. Throughout the series this fellow inmate has been their inspiration to endure everything in life, move forward and shape their future.\r\nThe story is pretty simple and a little slow but it is delivered perfectly asthere are no loose ends throughout the series and everything is wrapped up perfectly in the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt-10\\n\r\nArt is amazing and animated very well with very vibrant colors.\\n\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\r\nThe music is very good especially joe's song which is a very powerful moment for his character and so are the sound effects and the dubbing of the voice actors as I could really feel the emotions every character is portraying and what the mood of the scene is.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-9\\n\r\nCharacters are amazing in this anime. I could not find any of the protagonists that I don't care about because they are presented as real human characters which could exist in real life. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series every protagonist is well fleshed out and none of them are really \"useless\" which many anime series fails at.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complain here is the lack of a good villain since all of them in the series are either not developed enough or a cliche very sinister looking/over the top \"evil bad guy type.\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\r\nThe series is very entertaining for me  and it is one of the only few shows that mad me shed manly tears of bot sorrow and joy. Watching how the characters persevere through their struggles and the message of friendship, love and hope good enough for me to invest valuable time in finishing this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\r\nAll in all it is almost a perfect 10 for me but nonetheless I consider this anime one of the best I have ever watched and for those who like drama and tragedy with a good message, you should definitely give this a try.\\n",

            "content": "After finishing episode 1 of this series, I took a deep breath. I was so engrossed that I had apparently forgotten to breathe while I was watching.\r\nAfter finishing episode 26, I finally exhaled. This series was a rush of nonstop emotion all the way throw and never faltered for a second. Everything I said here over a half a year ago holds completely true and I can't flaunt my glowing recommendation for this series enough.\r\nRainbow is definitely one of the best things Japan has put out in a long time, and not in an ironic \"Oh, Japan!\" flashy comedy/campy/ridiculous way. It's a serious story. Soserious that the first episode starts off with a disclaimer about explicit content. Think about that for a second. In a medium like anime where there's blood, tits and who knows that else in so many shows, what are they warning you about? Real stuff, that's what. Unlike Lucy ripping the head off some moe girl in Elfen Lied, Rainbow is constantly presented as a brutal, depressing series where the violent content is required to present the story in a proper way.\\n\\n\r\nBut don't be put off because it sounds too depressing or even boring(I don't know how anyone could think this, personally), because Rainbow is also a story of true bro-ship. Like Gungrave before it, Rainbow will be bleak. It will be depressing. But through all that, a heartwarming tale of friendship will shine. A tale that's under the perpetual threat of being crushed by the blackened circumstances around it, and that's what will keep you engrossed.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is terrific, as expected of Madhouse by this point. This includes the great still art that pops in during narrated scenes, as seen by the series' title art to the left. The whole episode, and most likely a good portion of the series was depicted with very few colors other than shades of grey and dark blue. Any bright things on screen are bright things in the eyes of the story, like the sunshine outside or the end of a lit cigarette shared between the beaten characters. This was a very fine touch and does nothing but add to the heavy atmosphere of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe audio and the animation work beautifully in tandem, with the music bringing scenes to life by boosting the dank atmosphere. The opening by Coldrain is especially great, bringing a badass touch to the show. Similarly, the voices are gruff and work very well with the rest of the presentation.\\n\\n\r\nThe above was stated after watching episode 1, and now that the series is over I think it's time to address these issues. Firstly, Rainbow finished excellently. It did not, however, cover the entire 22 volumes of story and instead opted to stop around volume 12 or so. This is no reason to not watch the series, as the stopping point they chose was pretty tactfully chosen and very satisfying. When it comes to negatives, Rainbow suffered from two things at certain points: Pacing and over-emotion. Even if you haven't read the manga, there's a good chance you'll notice that certain parts, mostly in the second half, seem rushed or like they crammed too many chapters into an episode and that makes it seem like the story skips around a little too much. It's not a big deal at all and very rarely detracts from anything, but it's a factor you'll probably notice. One of the bigger factors that may not sit well with some is that the series can come off as a little too over-dramatized or sappy at points. Sometimes the manly guitar solos and power ballads work incredibly well and you'll be clenching your teeth with man tears streaming down your cheeks, and other times it doesn't work too well. That's something that'll vary a lot from person to person though. \\n\\n\r\nThe final thing that bothered me was that one of the characters never gets an episode or arc devoted to him, which is pretty unsettling considering the other six boys got the spotlight multiple times. That was the main casualty of the long manga->short anime transition, so what can you do?\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, Rainbow's definitely in the top 10, maybe even top 5 shows of the year 2010. Not watching it should be a crime.",

            "content": "*This review WILL contain spoilers\r\n Since the anime has such a high score and a crazy amount of 10/10 reviews (what aggravates me, because its far from perfect), i will write a review, pointing all of the problems i found with it. This anime was very hard to watch and relate to at a lot of points. No, not because of how sad and harsh it is, but because as an anime that takes itself seriously its too inconsistent and illogical. Now don't get me wrong, this anime has a lot of strong points, but they still can't fully cover for all the flaws. Illstart from the very beginning, and state every problem i personally spotted and can remember (by chronological order).\\n\\n\r\n An-chan \"kills\" his father. Its also said he committed suicide. So how exactly did An-chan get to the reformatory? Did he turn himself in to the police saying he is the one who did it? If so, did no one bother checking? Because his father didn't have a grudge against him, and logically would commit suicide in a way that can't be connected to his son (to avoid giving him more trouble)... What follows is the suicide incident (in the reformatory). An-chan didn't seem to be a stupid guy. He only had a few months left, so he could just quietly get out and bring both the bad guys to justice. Instead he decided to tell Ishihara that he knows. WHY? No logical explanation is provided, and none is even possible. \\n\\n\r\n Next up is \"Turtle\". I'm not sure about the circumstances of the post nuclear bombing aid that was given (or not given) in japan, but shouldn't he have been placed in some sort of hospital and/or trauma rehabilitation facility, and if he ran off and was judged, wouldn't he at least get a more considerate verdict based on his personal file?\\n\\n\r\n Moving on. When the boys come to the reformatory, they seem to be already familiar with each other, how, and when did that happen, and why is it not mentioned? Also why did An-chan decide to beat them all up when they got there? Because it was completely unnecessary, and frankly out of character for him to do so, the only reason for this event i can think of is to speed up their bonding instead of showing it develop overtime (though frankly i doubt that one as well, because usually no one would bond with someone that beat them up faster that if he wouldn't)... The boys in the reformatory also seem to have the ability to go the the library as they please, yet never use it except for one time... What's the point of sitting in a prison cell then if they can always or at least sometimes be in the library?!\\n\\n\r\n Side characters. They just seem to be there for decoration, as if no one else even exists. When Joe runs away and gets caught, he clearly states that the woman who took him in raped him in front of two guards, and she replies in a hostile way and even hits him and draws blood. The two guards seem shocked, but this does not lead anywhere. When the fire starts at the reformatory, no one seems interested to investigate why and how it started, and why 7 people where almost burned alive. Why does it seem no one else supervises the reformatory aside the doctor? In episode 2 the director is shown, but later he's never mentioned. The doctor also seems to have too much power (able to fire guards and he's completely unsupervised). Why does that stay true after 2 lethal accidents and a fire that almost killed 7 people? Normally those events would definitely earn the attention of investigators and the director. \\n\\n\r\n After the fire, An-chan decides to come out of the infirmary early, again, for no apparent reason. He is put in with a few angry cell mates who where instructed to beat him to death overtime. He endures it. But after his friend gets hurt while trying to persuade them to take it out on him instead, he beats them all up at once, and threatens them so they won't blame him and the problem gets solved. The question arises - why the heck didn't he do that in the first place?\\n\\n\r\n When An-chan is made to starve, a good guard appears. Instead of talking to other guards and maybe filing a report, he goes against the doc and Ishihara, eventually getting killed (again, with no consequences, because its apparently easier to kill a guard than a prisoner. Another point - this man, who pretty much lost his life while trying to help the protagonists, got completely forgotten, and the boys didn't even once visit his grave). \\n\\n\r\n And finally, the escape. Everything would be ok about it if you have a very short memory, BUT, if you do remember back a little, an important detail gets left out (for the plot convenience, as usual). When Joe escaped, the director said that the police will be involved if he's not back in 48 hours. This time nothing like that was mentioned. So, was that not important in the first place? Or if it was, then the police surely got involved this time, so why was it not shown, and why was it fruitless?\\n\\n\r\n An-chan's death. It was ridiculous. There was so many problems with this event alone that its almost comical. First off - Ishihara shot the gun. He shot it a few times, NEAR A MILITARY BASE. Now i don't know what anyone thinks, but let me assure you, if something like that really happened, the guards would come running. Yet no one came (until later, when it serves the wanted plot... in reality - just in time to be court martialed for not doing their job), not after the shooting, and not after the motorcycle accident. An-chan didn't knock him out for some reason as well (though if you'd consider his character he WOULD do that much before he got stabbed). Now explain to me, if going back to see the boxing match was so important, why did he remember it just when it was convenient? Why not just knock out Ishihara? Why not knock him out after giving him the letter and he still came at him? And why remember to go back only when he's about to get killed, taking the knife out and walking menacingly towards armed men? I mean he above all else should have known that getting killed is the worst possible thing he can do to his friends... \\n\\n\r\n And what about the cops who decided to side with An-chan at the very end? What happened to the investigation of why he got killed? All the leads where there - Ishihara's finger prints on the gun, the man who called them and said he had the gun, and then lied to them and told them to shoot the wrong guy? Why was Ishihara not interrogated and put in prison/ mental facility? How did the doctor not get arrested over that, how did he leave the reformatory, and how on the earth some time later, he, being a DOCTOR tried running for a mayor? \\n\\n\r\n Later we have the \"revenge\". It was pretty good, BUT... Logically, it would be a pretty big scoop, leading to a major investigation. This would mean that Mario (and Turtle) would no longer have to be a fugitive if he simply turned himself in, and aided the investigation, explaining his circumstances. But he doesn't, because it seems logic and this anime are on a different wavelength.\\n\\n\r\n And finally we get to the last parts - the protagonist's arcs. First off - Mario. This is just a load of bull. A man in the bar where he is an assistant at, doesn't pay for the drink and assaults the owner, while breaking property. Mario then lets him hit himself twice before beating him up. Now what do we have here? 3 witnesses that saw the barman being assaulted, followed by Mario, who then applied self defense. 3 against 1! And he probably had a past of doing so in other bars too! Logically, he would be too afraid to even file a complain, because he's clearly at fault and there where 3 witnesses. Instead, the bar owner fires him because \"he dislikes this sort of thing\" (though the barman clearly likes him, and logically would help file a complaint), and Mario and Joe just keep quiet about it. The stupidity in this one is overwhelming. \\n\\n\r\n Instead, Soldier gets hurt trying to get the guy at fault to sign a document saying Mario is not at fault (instead of getting the asshole in jail and revoking his complaint that way)... All for nothing, because the judge is a moron, an aggressive one on top of it. Normally, the scoop from the doctor's arrest would be pretty much enough to explain everything, yet it seems they forgot that thing exists. Instead, Baremoto turns out to be a son of the judge's friend, and they get the girl to testify she was raped and that was the reason Mario got into the reformatory in the first place, so Mario leaves happily (despite all the stuff the judge told him, and even hit him)\\n\\n\r\n Next up is Joe. The logic fail is rather immense in this one, so i will explain it in depth. The problem here is when Joe is late to his concert, after almost getting killed, along with the woman who sponsored him in exchange for having sex with her. She is not portrayed as too bad of a character up to now, except making Joe lay with her to fulfill his dream. Yet after she fails to protect him, nearly gets him and herself killed and saved by his friends, instead of being shocked, or explaining Joe that its over for him (like you'd expect of her), suddenly, for no reason at all she starts to yell at him that he's a loser, its his fault for being late, and that he'll always stay scum... Just W T F . It was so frustrating to watch, not because i felt bad for Joe (at this pint i lost all emotional involvement and was torn between laughing my ass off or getting mad trying to understand wtf just happened), but because it was so horribly illogical and retarded.\\n\\n\r\n Baremoto. At the fire incident, he learned to trust his friends, and that they are the most important thing in the world for him. At his arc though, he falls for a prostitute, and forgets it all without a single hesitation. This is BS. Not as BS though as Turtle's arc, who we got led to believe was seriously ill because of being near and in the blast zone of a nuke, but then, suddenly, its all ok, and we forget all about it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this sums it up for the story problems, now for my other problems with this anime: \\n\\n\r\nNo soldier arc! \\n\r\nThe anime could use an extra ending and opening. \\n\r\nAnd finally, the characters are too immature and shounen like, while its supposed to be seinen. I also didn't expect there would be so much happy endings for everyone in it. Now don't get me wrong, Its not like i don't like happy endings.. But those look so forced, undeserved and unfitting. Not much gets resolved, after An-chan's death and revenge on their tormentors, the only problems are trivial stuff, arising from the boys being unable to deal with the real world. Yet they want to make it look like its just as dramatic and bad as everything else that happened before, and that feels as ridiculous as if a man who just literally escaped from hell itself with relative ease, suddenly broke down after being called a \"poopy face\" by a little kid.\\n\r\n*Edit* : Oh, and how could i forget? There's an extremely annoying narration going on, always pointing out the obvious and taking up extra time, not to mention the voice of the narrator is in itself pretty bad, like one you'd get in an old, self dubbed video in the 90's\\n\\n\r\nSo final verdict- the anime is not bad, but the story falls apart due to the infinite plot holes, inconsistency and logic fails, as well as the characters being unfit for the universe around them, and having pretty small issues in the second half compared to the first half of the show, leading to a fall in interest. Despite that 6 is usually a score i'd usually say is somewhat good, i would not really recommend this anime, as its major trait that is supposed to be the dark atmosphere and struggles of the protagonists is severely broken apart and comical if you have a long attention span and look at it critically.",

            "content": "What exactly is friendship? Are your friends more important to you than your family? What are you willing to go through for a friend? Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin (for the rest of the review the anime will be referred to simply as Rainbow) focuses on friendship, as well as several other themes based around friendship, such as humanity, morality, violence, love, family etc. This is my review:\r\nStory - Rainbow is a tale about seven inmates in a special reform school who grow closer with the increased time they spend together. All seven of them are there for committing several crimes which shaped these verydifferent yet very similar individuals. From the opening moments of the first episode right through to the last scene of the last episode I was hooked. The show grabbed me and forced me to sit down and watch what happened next. Rainbow is brutal, mature, dark and at times depressing. But I was surprised at how light the show can get at certain points, from the funny banter between the seven inmates to the way they overcome obstacles by relying on each other and their bond. The tone shifts from time to time but Rainbow manages to keep the shifts fluid and smooth. For me, Rainbow had two highlights, and the story was definitely one of them. The writing was well done because the show didn't come off as melodramatic and managed to feel really inspirational at certain points and there were more twists than one would expect from a show like this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - I mentioned that the show had two aspects that really stood out. The characters were the second aspect. These were really cool guys. They were bad ass but they were portrayed in such a sympathetic way that you would root for all of them, sort of like multi-layered anti-heroes. The story was really amazing but I really enjoyed seeing the guys react to the situations they found themselves in. Character driven stories always work when it's executed properly. Like I said their friendship is an intricate part of the story. It is tested time and time again. It's wonderful to see selfless friendship like the one showed here. If you have a best friend or an entire \"entourage\" that you'll take a bullet for you'll know what I'm talking about. Two characters took a back seat to the others sometimes but that didn't detract from how enjoyable Rainbow was.\\n\\n\r\nSound - The voice acting was fantastic with each character sounding like they ought to. It is a lot more difficult to illustrate chemistry between animated characters than live-action characters but once again Rainbow manages to pull it off. There are a couple of bonuses available in the form of short clips with some the show's voice actors and I must say I really found new respect for seiyuus. The OP is probably not for everyone. A heavy metal track will turn some off but in my opinion it fitted well with the tone and atmosphere of the show. Listen to it and you'll know what to expect. The rest of the OST wasn't very bad and after listening to \"A FAR OFF DISTANCE\" I just had to get it on my phone.\\n\\n\r\nArt - Rainbow's art is really good. I'm not an artist so I don't know how to explain it in detail but it's not too shabby. The art is very realistic like seinen should be. There are no alterations to characters' facial expressions for Japanese slapstick and like the voice acting, the art of each inmate fits to their personality and who they are.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - A part of me wishes that I didn't see Rainbow because after watching it, it'll be hard to find another series that will be able to top the standard Rainbow set. The story is brutal and violent, but also sincere and inspirational. The characters are extremely likeable and their relationship can get one emotional. Lump in throat emotional. The voice acting and soundtrack sound great and the art is beautiful. George Abe and Masumi Kakizaki really managed to create a distinctive style here.\\n\\n\r\nRainbow is a fantastic character driven story chronicling the lives of seven inmates who became best friends. The show is not for the weak of heart but please give it a try, you'll be surprised how much you love it. \\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nWho said anime was just for kids?\\n\\n",

            "content": "Rainbow : Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin - after watching episodes of this anime, one word kept coming to my mind. \"Beautiful\". This anime shows how beautiful friendship can be. Acts of selflessness, sacrificing oneself to help another, returning to that one special place - It's all present in Rainbow. It's a good mix of emotion, struggle and drama. Rainbow is one superb anime, regrettably, it's buried deep within the other numerous popular titles out there and I'm glad I found it(more like stumbled upon).\r\nStory? Rainbow focuses on seven teenagers who are found guilty of committing crimes and are sent to a Disciplinary school/Reformatory. In reality,it was Hellhole for them because they received very harsh treatment by some of the authorities to the point where they got thrashed by a group of hired thugs and received a lot of unnecessary punishment, though not all of the main characters suffered the same exact punishment. The story takes place in 1955, a decade after the end of the Second World War. During that time, Japan in it's state, still rebuilding its cities after the war and corruption is common. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of plot, it can be rather predictable sometimes. Characters' \"motives\" are predictable as ever too. What's very common in anime are that you can tell who's evil and who's not; Especially, when one of those anime characters who always had their eyes shut, suddenly they open their eyes and with a wide silly grin across their face obviously tells you that they are up to no good. It often shows that their intentions are usually bad too. But even with that, with lots of edge-of-seat action scenes, plenty of sorrowful moments, plot twists and memorable acts of friendship - Rainbow's overall storyline is top notch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter? Rainbow have a nice cast of main characters each with an interesting backstory. The seven protagonists of cell six each have their own unique personalities. Also, Character development is good. For example, Mario Minakami. In the start, He was weak and sometimes talks big but with help in the later episodes, he becomes a badass.  The MCs are initially hostile towards each other but soon after they start helping out they quickly become friends. My favourite character in the series is Sakuragi Rokurouta: a young man with a boxing talent. He's also the oldest, strongest and acts as the leader out of the seven. With all that, Sakuragi Rokurouta is a man worth respecting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound? The Opening theme is extremely good because I like these kind of songs: the Rock/Metal genre. Opening theme \"We're not alone\", sung in English by Japanese Band Coldrain was epic. Not only that the opening theme was awesome, but its also very fitting for the anime. The ending theme, wasn't entirely great, still I don't think its too bad. Also, whenever one of the protagonists gets serious, a distinct background music kicks in. Voice acting was brilliant but I find the English voice overs of the American characters sound a little weird.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Visuals? The overall visuals passable. I think the dark/gloomy art style and colors really does suit the anime. However, Viewers who constantly had been watching anime with bright visuals might find Rainbow's visuals repulsive. Amusingly, all the evil characters in the series look so hideous. Characters' hair colours are natural; colours that naturally exist in real life: black, dark brown, blonde, etc. No, I don't hate the colorful hair that exist in anime, but the natural hair colors  gives a more realistic feel.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion? Rainbow is an anime with an inspiring story and have many likeable characters. However, some people may find Rainbow's art style unappealing, but even you don't like that, you should at least give it a try. But for fans of thriller/Drama or anyone looking for a good anime of its genre, it's a must watch. \\n",

            "content": "'RAINBOW - The Seven from Cell 2-6' is about seven teens who spent time in same cell of Shounan Disciplinary School after committing separate juvenile crimes in 1955.\r\nThis series is one of the purest example of Japanese \"Yankee\" or \"Furyou\" (high school deliquent) Drama . Although prominent in Japanese films, this genre is extremely rare in recent anime series possibly due to lack of interest from typical otaku demographics and decline of furyou in Japan. As far as I know, 'Sakigake! Cromatie High School' being the only other one (and many other series in lesser extent, such as 'GTO' and 'Gokusen'). 'RAINBOW' is a hard-boiledfuryou drama in its purest form.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Character: 7.5/10\\n\r\n'RAINBOW' is a very character-driven series with at least two solid episodes dedicated to development of each cellmate.\\n\\n\r\nThe story start out a bit too fast and forces viewers to accept convenient plot developments. Typical furyou drama of this type would take about a quarter of the story to introduce the gang and better half of the screen time to establish the bond between each member. In 'RAINBOW', however, all seven are gathered in the very first episode with light introduction by the narrator, and immediately form a strong bond. By ep4, they've become inseparable friends with absolute trust.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough such rapid formation of trust is hard to swallow, it allows larger portion of the story to challenges and hardships that awaits them.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half is mainly about the seven's time spent in prison. As one would expect of a furyou drama, all the characters start as troublesome and selfish individuals until being united by a leader. That leader in this series is 'An-chan'. As a senior in the disciplinary school, he teaches his juniors true strength and importance of friendship as they overcome various hurdles and eventually \"graduate\" from the school and form new goals.\\n\\n\r\nWhereas most furyou drama end there, 'RAINBOW' continues on to the second half, tackling issues such delinquents will encounter in society beyond the protective environment of a school. They face corruption, discrimination, and exploitation by adults, but with the help of friends and hard work, they find new hopes.\\n\\n\r\nAll the main characters have distinct personalities and dark pasts, but all of them are either falsely convicted or had good reasons to commit their crimes. The story once again forces us to accept such convenient premise for plot development and melodrama.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in this series is very heavy and emotional draining, but at the same time, too convenient and ignores character motivations from time to time for the sake of drama. All characteristics of traditional drama in mid-1900s Japanese storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\r\nEvery episode begins with an explicit warning. While this series is nowhere near graphic as some other anime series I've encountered, this warning is very appropriate since this series faithfully follows traditional seishun/furyou anime qualities other than the violence.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected of Madhouse, artwork and character design successfully captures the gloomy and depressing atmosphere of the post-war Japan. Animation in general was nothing fancy, but consistent throughout the series and relatively pleasing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nThere was a lot of frozen manga sketch scenes to enhance drama. This is a signature technique in classic anime that worked very effectively in establishing retro atmosphere of this series.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, it lacked detail sometimes, but the atmosphere is great, and it's an excellent example of old style animation with modern improvements.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast did a great job, pretty much everyone sounded like they should and none sounded annoying at all. What's significant about the cast was that it uses many major Japanese actors as voice actors. Oguri Shun, who starred as the protagonist in furyou film and manga adaptation 'Crows ZERO' plays Mario. Waki Tomohiro, who starred in many movies and TV drama as a fat delinquent student plays Cabbage. Also a major actress Kanjiya Shihori as Setsuko.\\n\\n\r\nThe narration in this series by the veteran voice actress Hayashibara Megumi was absolutely phenomenal. Retro female narration voice in rough, delinquent talk further sets the atmosphere, and was a highlight of the series for me.\\n\\n\r\nBGM was sparingly used, but significantly added to drama and inspiration in crucial scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOP including the animation was amazing. I usually don't like foreign-language theme songs in Japanese shows, but it was fitting for the despair and toughness of the characters, and the opening animation in itself was exciting and had all the major qualities and symbolism of this series. ED, once again, is very retro Japan.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\n'RAINBOW' is one of those serious anime that's becoming increasingly rare in recent years. Like all furyou drama, it focuses on friendship and trust among friends, but it doesn't shy away from the the toughness of real life. It's a classic drama that depicts cruelty, corruption, sorrow, and eventually hope in depressing post-WWII Japan.\\n\\n\r\nThe story feel forced and melodramatic at times, but then again, that's pretty common classic Japanese storytelling. This is a series that really feels like you're watching a retro piece, but offer values that modern viewers can still relate to. As long as you allow yourself to connect with the characters, this will be a very enjoyable series.\\n\\n\r\nI feel this is the most neglected series of the season (ending Summer '10), and definitely a must-watch for serious anime viewers.",

            "content": "Rainbow starts off fine with an interesting concept (boys from post WWII) but this show could have been so much more if they really stuck to that principle. As stated early on, the author wanted to emphasize the coolness of his characters, and given that, it shows in how little this anime develops anything else.\r\nThe art aside from some violent scenes is pretty average, and it's generally made obvious who the antagonists are from the art style alone. Given that, it reduces the amount of surprise and suspense that the show has. Minor points for the art successfully making me hate the villains and findthe good guys...cooler though. If that was the purpose, at least it was consistent about that.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course the characters.  Certainly...they are cool, all of them featuring somewhat blindly noble ideals taught by their beloved Anchan. Unfortunately character development isn't as strong as it should be. Even after a few years pass, all the characters in this show remain pretty much the same, and never really grow out of their flaws. However Mario's changes in becoming a carbon copy of Anchan basically flashes the word \"cliche\" in bright red bold letters. During the last half of the show, some time is spent to supposedly go into detail what the characters to to make a living, except for Soldier unfortunately, and the transition from character arc to character arc is very abrupt, assuming that you will understand what is going on from watching the introduction of all the characters. Each of these arcs unfortunately is plagued by use of the same cliche devices - a repetition of the story about how friendship wins everything - and I find that gets boring at a certain point.\\n\\n\r\nRainbow looked interesting when it was first released, and don't get me wrong, I found it moderately entertaining. However I will be clear that this show is just average at best. It falls into too many cliche patterns and fails to actually go more in depth about its original draw to attention; this show should have done more work in portraying the problems of post WWII life. That I believe is the reason why most people including myself watched this show in the first place.",

            "content": "Rainbow is one of those precious gems that get lost among the popular action/romance/silly anime, that happen to air at the same time. At first glance, it might seem as a well-worn drama set in an after-all dramatic post-war period. That 's what I thought. And I regret that thinking.. One episode was more than enough to captivate me..What is exceptionnal about this show, is the great deliverance of emotions. With no exaggerations or deficiencies, the emotions are there, the way they should be.. You 'll find yourself cry - be it of joy or of sorrow-, get angry, anticipate anxiously and share the samehopes with the characters.\\n\r\nLet me say first that this review is my very first, so please bear with me and pardon any mistakes..\\n\\n\r\n~Plot 9/10~\\n\r\nThe story follows the lives of 7 teenagers, who have been placed in a reformatory for minor crimes. That's where they all meet and where their journey of life begins. Their daily humiliation and suffering are presented through intense realistic scenes, that make you feel uneasy, as well as a wonderful narration. In this rotten prison, where every single thing seems corrupted,the 7 boys discover the true meaning of friendship, self-sacrifice, hope and solidarity. But, of-course, not in the easy way.. Pretty much, this is the story. You definitely have seen it before, but not this well developed.\\n\r\nAn important thing, that you should know is that the story is somehow divided in two parts. I cannnot explain more because it would be a spoiler, and i wouldn't want to \"spoil\" you. I can only say that the critical point is episode 14.\\n\r\nThe first part , in my opinion, was much better than the second one, in terms of suspense and anxiety. The second part, is interesting enough, but kind of more predictable and cliched.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters 9/10~\\n\r\nThe characthers is the strong point of this show. Each one chased by his own demons, tries to fight for his life but never forgetting his friends, who come above all. Every character is unique and has his own secrets and dreams, but they all share the same love for one another. However, some characters are more highlighted, thus more likeable. Generally, the characters are nice but sometimes TOO nice, to the point where you feel like watching saints. \\n\\n\r\n~Art 8/10~\\n\r\nThe art is , for my tastes, mediocre. Some characters are drawn very nicely but others are really messed up. Especially the villains. They are actually quite creepy..Overall, I think that the art is great for this show, where you don't expect hot guys or fancy backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound 8/10~\\n\r\nThe music is another element that is very carefully done in this show. It embodies and amplifies the emotions. The opening and the ending songs are good, not exceptionnal. The voice actors, also, do a great job.\\n\\n\r\nSO TO SUM UP...\\n\\n\r\nWhy to watch??\\n\r\nBecause you like dramas, uncensored violent scenes, disturbing truths, secret pasts, the feeling of justice being delivered, the journey of life with its good and bad, life and death situations, friendship between men, disgusting villains, unpredictable twists on the plot and many other things that you'll discover if you watch it..\\n\\n\r\nWhy NOT to watch??\\n\r\nI can't handle violence, I don't like men crying, heavy drama, too much injustice. Right now, I can't think of anything else..\\n\\n\r\nI hope I helped you. Personally, I would recommend it to anyone. Even if it isn't your thing, just watch the first episode. You won't lose anything..\\n",

            "content": "If I was to sum up the entire series so far in two words, it would be these: simply amazing.\r\nStory: 10\r\nThis story is definitely one of the best I have seen so far in an anime. It follows the story of seven young men who are put in a school called the Sh\u014dnan Special Reform School, which is basically just a prison. They don't know anything about each other at first but eventually they grow closer and form a bond that is so strong it can never be broken.\r\nArt: 9\r\nThe art in Rainbow is decent. Nothing spectacular but nothing to complain about. The animation isfluid and everything is easy to see. Unlike many anime there are no chibi/joke scenes. The majority of the scenes are darker due to the general atmosphere of the show. The reason I gave it a 9 is that the show is very grainy, which is more or less a matter of preference.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are very good. The opening is completely in English while the ending features both Japanese and English. They both do an excellent job of conveying the message of bonds and not giving up, which showcases the show's values perfectly. The show itself doesn't have a lot of music but when there is music it does a good job of capturing the mood.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Rainbow are excellent. They all have very different personalities and they all gradually change over time. Not just the protagonists, but even the antagonists are very well developed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis show is really a must-see, there isn't much like it in the world of anime. Some of you might be reluctant to pick up Rainbow like I was, since it doesn't exactly look like the best show in the world on the outside. However, trust me, watch an episode or two, and you'll know exactly when I'm talking about. You'll be glad that you did.",

            "content": "\"No matter how tired you are, or how much punishment you take, look into his eyes. Never look down.\"\r\nWhen I read the description for Rainbow, I knew I'd have to watch it. A story of a circle of friends being forged under the anvil of the Japanese disciplinary school system...sounds like an awesome \u201cfor men\u201d type story, right? Well, as I quickly found out, Rainbow bites off way more than it can chew, and in the end its execution does not keep up with its ambitious ideas. It is still a fairly engrossing and entertaining series, but \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d this ain't.\r\nRainbow begins with sixteenage criminals being taken by bus to a reform school. We're informed that the year is 1955. I guess in Japan in 1955 \u201creform school\u201d basically meant \u201cmaximum security prison for kids,\u201d because this place has the works\u2014armed guards, high walls, and lots of cells. A guard leads the six boys to their holding cell, and it's there that the six newcomers meet Rokurouta Sakuragi, an ex-boxer and two year veteran of the reform school. Sakuragi earns the respect of the boys by easily beating all of them in a six-on-one fight. When a sadistic guard enters the cell and offers to let the boys beat Sakuragi with a wooden club as punishment, they gain Sakuragi's respect by steadfastly refusing the demands of the guard. Afterward, Sakuragi takes the six boys under his wing, teaching them the ropes of survival in the harsh world of the reform school. We later learn that the aforementioned guard has an obsessive vendetta against Sakuragi, and the boys engage in a dangerous game of cat and mouse against this guard and the prison's administrators, with Sakuragi protecting the boys and the boys protecting Sakuragi.\\n\\n\r\nWhew. That's one heck of a plot, and it does have a certain crazed momentum and intensity to it. It's the kind of show where, at the end of an episode, you'll want to immediately watch the next one, and that's a feat in and of itself. However, there are sacrifices made to maintain this rapid pacing. The show really skips a lot of development that would have been necessary to fully flesh out the cast of characters. For example, between the first and second episodes, we're informed that a month has passed, and that the boys have become good friends in this time. I would have rather seen them become friends than simply be told that they've become friends; you really have to suspend your sense of disbelief to honestly feel like anyone could develop live-saving bonds of friendship in the period of time allotted in this series. The show makes this tradeoff of character development for plot speed on several occasions, and the end result is that, while I thought this was going to be a dark and mature prison drama about friendship under the worst of circumstances, it sort of ends up being a prison thriller where friendship is just a convenient device used to explain the plot's direction (Q: \u201cWhy did this event happen?\u201d A: \u201cFRIENDSHIP, MAN\u201d). \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of explaining plot direction, there is one aspect of this show that annoyed me more than any other: The narrator. This show has a female narrator (who you might recognize as the voice of Rei from Evangelion) who occasionally interjects to make inane and obvious observations about what's going on. The end result is similar to watching an action movie with your stupid friend who likes to point out everything that happens. For example, let's say there's a scene where the boys get brutally beaten by the guards. The show will then pause on a still frame of the boys dispirited faces, and the narrator will say something like \u201cOn that day, the boys were once again dispirited by the brutal beatings of the guards.\u201d If that seems redundant to you, that's because it is. Narration of this type does not tell me anything that I could not have learned by watching, and really serves no purpose whatsoever. It's not even an issue of \u201cshow, don't tell.\u201d It's an issue of \u201cyou already showed me this, you do not need to tell me it too.\u201d Three episodes into the series, I was tired of hearing the narrator talk, and every time she does, the show falters just a little bit more.\\n\\n\r\nRainbow's animation is a product of Madhouse, so you pretty much know it's going to look good. Every character design is unique in its own right, and while it's tough to make a world of gray appealing, they pull it off. Sequences of action (fistfights being the most common example) are smoothly and lovingly animated. Can't say much about this other than that it's a job well done, although one thing that I really must comment on is the occasional absurdity of the art and animation during scenes of emotion. I wish I could insert a screenshot of one of the characters crying to accompany this comment; it literally looks like characters spew thick, viscous tears from every bodily orifice. \\n\\n\r\nRainbow's soundtrack is unusually mixed, and strangely appropriate. There are upbeat rock/jazz numbers for the many moments of inspirational bro-love, atmospheric pieces for dark scenes of prison violence, and the obligatory sad orchestral songs for those would-be tearjerk moments. The show opens with a fast-paced metalcore song that I initially thought was ludicrously out of place, but eventually I warmed to it. It ends on a more tender note with a slower pop song. All in all, pretty well-chosen music.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, if you're looking for something that offers a mature take on serious issues, my personal opinion is that RAINBOW just isn't it. It's a fast-paced, plot-focused, action-heavy show that's been poorly disguised as a character-driven drama, and while the characters don't fall entirely flat, I'd say most of them are only a step or two above it. But it is a well-plotted series, and survives on suspense and visceral momentum that are uncommon today. In terms of sheer entertainment, Rainbow is a winner. Its failings are purely in the theme and character departments.",

            "content": "\"Most people are prisoners, thinking only about the future or living in the past. They are not in the present, and the present is where everything begins.\" - Carlos Santana.\r\nDealing with the past is not easy especially when you commit something terrible. Say, a crime. Then, you think about the future but that little hope is so far away because where you are now is somewhere that you never want to be: prison. Trapped like a caged bird and nowhere to go, nowhere to run, your future is about to go down the drain faster than the rain pouring outside. This is what happens whenyou commit a crime. This is what happens when you disobey the law. This is what happens in Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I finished the series Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin over a rainy weekend. It's funny too since Coldrain also sings the OP song and this story is anything but hot. It is cold. It is thrilling. It is emotional and it throws drama right into your face with a boxing punch.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say that this is one of the most underrated series I've seen in awhile. From the first episode, I was intrigued by possibly just the first 10 minutes. Now, I'm a bit fan of prison like theme and at first, it felt like watching Deadman Wonderland which I did enjoy also. Long thought cut short, this series creates a touching story, a story of emotional drama and psychological thriller. This series pushes violence in the RIGHT way unlike some series that has just presents unnecessary gore every 5 minutes. This anime did not make that mistake, at least from my point of view.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the series presented involves the prison style and what it is like to feel the guilt after committing a crime. It makes you feel the realism and the severe consequences of committing a bad deed. And of course in prison, there are prisoners and wardens. Unfortunately for our protagonists, they are not on good terms with a few particular characters namely Ishihara. He is one of the most sadistic characters in the series and I think most people (including myself) would probably want to beat him half to death after watching the first half.\\n\\n\r\nBut not all is gloom and doom because there are also characters that sparks light into that cave of darkness. That light would definitely be Sakuragi for his way of protecting the others after an emotional drama that left him scars. He is very driven to protecting what he believes is right and those are his friends. He can be pushed to his own physical limit by Ishihara but when faced with seeing his precious friends suffering, his rage reaches a boiling point where he disregards his own safety. Now, I found that to be truly inspiring. The other characters of the series are also quite interesting ranging their past and history involving the dark mood of the story. Such an example would be Mario. He is also noticeable in the series as one of the main characters. At first, he gets into an intense fight with Sakurgai but later on views him as a close brother figure and inspires to be like him. His character development in seen as one of the major points of the series and after watching him develop was quite an interesting turn throughout the progressing episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, I loved the execution as well as its performance and thought this series lived up to its expectations. Not that it's any surprising anyways since one of my studios, Madhouse is involved. The art is performed spectacular and darkens the mood of the story. Throughout the episodes, there are manga like sketches that conveys the mood the story and through the narrator dialogue covers the background. It captures the sense and style and I really enjoyed its unique performance. Additionally, there are scars that portrays not only the physical but mental manifestations that drove some characters to become what they are. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP song of this series is also quite catchy even though I'm not familiar with the band. I tend to skip a lot of OP songs but didn't let a go pass on this one. Why would I anyways when it's so damn catchy? Good job Coldrain, kudos to you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, my enjoyment of this series was decent and did not feel like a waste of time. There were hardly any cliches I've found and the driven characters' development of the story from hopelessness to a better future makes me want to learn about them more and more. This series is not an anime that should be dropped from the first few episodes (as I'm sure some people have). Instead, concentrate on the dark setting of the story and its driven characters. Concentrate on the realism and the reality of being sent to prison after committing a bad deed. Why? Because crime is real and the consequences are there. That little hope is still there though because after a long pouring weekend, a rainbow does shine into the sky. That rainbow represents hope, a hope for a better future. Have hope in yourself and concentrate instead on the present. Like the song by Coldrain and lyrics says:\\n\\n\r\nWe are not alone.",

            "content": "Friendship is an extremely common theme in anime (in any medium for that matter) but rarely is it portrayed in hell. Set in a crippled 1950's Japan, Rainbow thrusts its seven protagonists into a juvenile refinement center, which is essentially a youth prison filled with guards who are out for blood. They give each other nicknames, befriend each other over a smoke, and carve their dreams on a tree for when they're finally free, and agree to meet there once again in the future.\r\nIt is a very gripping story and throughout the series you as the audience will be kept on your seat almostconstantly. The atmosphere is always extremely tense, and this is in-part due to the brilliant presentation. There are a lot of sombre guitar-based musical pieces, which are not anything particularly memorable on their own, but blend in with the material very nicely. The opening and ending are phenomenal scores though, the opening highlighting the brutal conditions in tone and lyrics and the ending contrasting it with a cold, melancholic feel. Both songs have phenomenal vocals as well.\\n\\n\r\nNot only is the animation fluent, but Rainbow also has a great usage of framing and angling. The show even utilizes bright, high-detail still frames without feeling cheap due to how infrequent they appear and how well they contrast and compliment the usual artwork of the show. During the first half of the show, the colour palette is mostly grey, which really brings out the dreariness of the setting. Couple this with the vivid redness of the blood and you yourself have a very grim experience. The boys are almost always in peril, and face very harsh consequences for their actions, some of which last a lifetime. This brutal reality only makes the catharsis that much more satisfying when the boys do succeed, creating a very exhilarating watch.\\n\\n\r\nBut as ruthless the show is, it lacks all subtlety. Along with most of the show's antagonists, Ishihara, the guard in charge of our cast's cell, is drawn very grotesquely to accentuate his sadism, and looks very unrealistic compared to the grittiness of the other characters. This is pretty unnecessary considering the extent of Ishihara's character is his sadism alone. Even the other antagonists, such as the pedophilic doctor Sasaki, are all very one-dimensional, and merely serve as villains for the sake of being villains. \\n\r\nThe protagonists are not that complex either. The seven boys all have a few traits to make them stand out, and while they develop nicely throughout the show, they don\u2019t have that much to them. Soldier and Cabbage are completely expendable and exist solely to have muscle and comic relief respectively. Sakuragi, the eldest, is a very stoic man, but cares for his friends deeply, and while this makes him likable, it doesn't make him all that memorable.\\n\\n\r\nRainbow is somewhat imbalanced in the way that it treats its characters. During the first half, most of the cast is given sob-story back-stories to make the audience care about them rather than actually developing them and their relationship. In this case, said victimization works, but it is still a cheap tactic. The back-stories can be quite melodramatic, but given the setting, and the fact that many criminals have childhood trauma, they rarely feel implausible, or as some may say, edgy. I really wish that the characters had been fleshed out more in the beginning as it would\u2019ve made the audience\u2019s care for them that much more genuine.\\n\\n\r\nIt is only during the second half, which takes place outside the prison, in which character dynamics are fully explored. The show handles this switch from thriller to slice of life very well, which is quite difficult to pull off. Albeit without some of the intensity, the characters\u2019 interpersonal problems are just as entertaining as the threats to their life in part one. Turtle and Uncovered are probably the best characters of the bunch. Turtle's charisma and sly, con-man nature always steals the spotlight, while Uncovered is a flawed but good-natured man which makes him very easy to relate to. Joe's dreams of becoming a singer are handled in a realistic manner as well, as he faces many bumps in the road, and his story proves that becoming a superstar is certainly no easy task. But no matter how tough it gets, Joe presses on, which displays a lot of growth in his character.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, all of the characters mature quite believable and subtly, which is something the show deserves a lot of credit for. This passage of time is most evident in Mario. He begins as an irrational boy, and idolizes Sakuragi to the point of taking up boxing, something Sakuragi loves. Eventually he develops a strong relationship with Setsuko, which forces him to grow and become his own man rather than just mirror Sakuragi.\\n\\n\r\nAll of these elements come together and create a very entertaining and down-to-earth story, although there are many small narrative inconsistencies littered throughout the show. For example, there is a scene in which one character is walking around in an atomic bomb site moments after it was detonated, when he should clearly have died due to radiation poisoning. Or another time when the cast managed to track down a woman across the country none of them knew the whereabouts to (or had any prior connections to) within a matter of days. This is the 1950's; such a task would be near impossible in such a short amount of time. Alone, these issues are fairly minor, but compounded they become very damaging to the immersion of the series.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest complaint is an extremely irrational and stupid decision made by Sakuragi around the halfway point. His blatant ignorance regarding almost all of the characters in the show almost cost his friends in prison their lives, if not for a convenience in the plot. But at the end of the day, none of these gripes destroy the experience completely, and the show still feels grounded enough to display its themes cohesively; and the main theme of Rainbow is friendship.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I wish the show would have spent more time developing their friendship throughout the earlier sections of the show, (as they go from strangers to eternal companions in just two episodes) Rainbow nails its thematic execution regarding the importance of camaraderie. The way the characters act so genuinely selfless towards one another is truly inspiring, and while the dialogue can sometimes feel unnatural or ham-fisted, the cast's actions speak far louder than their words. Everyone really needs each other to survive, inside the prison or out, and Rainbow displays this while still firmly grounded in reality.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is a mixed bag and the narrative can be very inconsistent but the brisk pacing and tense atmosphere keep excitement high while the subtext is powerful enough to linger in one\u2019s mind for months. Rainbow isn\u2019t something revolutionary, but it is a unique experience, so I can recommend it as something to be backlogged, and not necessarily watched right away.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The problem with ourselves right now is we usually too arrogant and easily judged anime just by seeing the cover. Without watching or see it, we can easily bashed and even judge the anime before even giving it a shot. Many covers in anime sometimes didnt really represent on whats gonna happen in the anime itself, Like Rainbow : Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin.\r\nSTORY \r\nWhats in your mind after seeing the cover? I can easily guess that you're gonna think this anime is about in prison and full of action. Well, thats 30% right. But, thats not all. Taking place after World War II, The storyin this anime was about 7 prisoners that must struggle to live in prison and how they dealt with it and they follows their life together and how they move on afterwards. Quite attracting, if i could said after hearing the premise.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself brings the manly, GAR and friendship themes. In this anime you can find many tearful, and moments about the bonds within the  prisoners but at the sametime its still GAR and manly. Confused? Well, it cant  helped. Usually, GAR or manly themes is always about gore, action, blood, and any violences act like in Berserk. But in Rainbow, that stereotypes is banished. Manly and GAR that i said in this anime was more about melancholic manly themes. If you ever have \"Manly tears were shed\" then this anime have A LOT of scenes that will makes you saying that. Well,it cant be helped since in this anime they more into explicit scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThis friendship theme in Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin is not like any friendship themes that shounen anime always brings which is always cliche and sometimes unlogical. In rainbow, its more darker and more realistic. Like sometimes they must betray their friends for their selfish goals and at the sametime, they must sacrifice themselves for someone who is called \"friends\".\\n\\n\r\nThis anime successfully execute and represent about the friendship bonds between men. Sometimes, some anime crossess the line between friendship and bromance but in Rainbow, you dont need to afraid. This anime purely about friendship and how they help each other within them even helping to get a girl. Again, Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin will bring you a friendship and manly story that you wouldnt have imagined before.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nMadhouse, who didnt know this studio producer? known for BECK, Black Lagoon, Death Note, and many other famous anime. They continued make an awesome anime like this anime Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin, Madhouse never let you down in anything,They have their own standard like in the art. The art in this anime is more into realistic type which is really suitable with the story, The background is quite detailed like in the prison. Its so dark and they use plain color to present \"depressing and how boring\" that lives in prison. For me, Its quite close like the real prison that usually have a heavy atmosphere and not-so-comfortable place.and  Rainbow is successfully make the viewers feels like in the real prison.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nWell, the OP in this anime was make this anime more epic. \"We're not alone\" singing by coldrain is really represent with this anime. This rock band who formed in Nagoya , is rarely make a song for anime. They (until now) just make song for 2 anime, Hajime no Ippo and Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin. But that doesnt mean this band have bad quality or like that, just hear the OP in Rainbow, the rock song is really suitable with anime that have manly themes and more the lyrics is seems have a connection in this anime like \"There's a place in this world where hope and dream are not yet lost\", Well, prison is a place where hope and dreams are lost. Summary, Not just hearable, and catchy the OP song in this anime have a meaningful lyric that connects with the anime itself which makes the song being more epic.\\n\\n\r\nFor the seiyuu, you wouldnt find any famous seiyuus in nowdays like Hanazawa Kana or maybe Mamoru Miyano (Well, but you will find several seiyuu from old generations like Rikitya Koyama whose voiced Kogoro (Detective Conan)) and i predict  you will guess the voice will be terrible and not really worthy, Well you're wrong guys. Again, dont judge anime by its covers, seiyuu, or anything else. This what shines the most. Every seiyuu is really suitable with the character which is their voiced. Non-famous seiyuus doesnt mean havent a quality, sometimes they can be a little diamond in amount of a lot famous seiyuu out there. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nThe character is what make Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin shines the most. In this one, you will find 7 men which have their own uniqueness. At the first, they being portrayed in this anime as the criminals but as long as the story goes you will find this \"criminals\" have their own reason why they do commit crimes and not just that, within 26 episodes you will see many epic, tearful moments with them. Also you will see how each characters struggle for achieving their own dreams. In this anime, the 7 men have their own unique dreams, like Mario who wanted to be a boxer or Mansuka Matsuura who wanted to eat good food everytime and What makes this anime is more fascinating is the character development. From relationship to the personality, you will see many developments in here and that what makes this anime so appealing.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\r\nSometimes i always wonder, why good anime like this have so few viewers than any sh*tful anime. Maybe because this anime doesnt have moe characters or ecchi scenes (maybe). But, for me seeing this masterpiece anime which just have a few viewers make me excited. Its like finding a hidden gem. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, if you're looking for manly but at the sametime touchy, then this anime is really for you. You will get GAR feeling but at the sametime you will have heartwarming feeling.and one more thing, this anime have so many tearjerker scenes. So prepare some tissues.\\n",

It begins with basically going over most of the past of the prisoners. It is nice to get some backstory of the supporting characters but gets tedious eventually. Mostly because they keep repeating about how they're all brothers and they all love each other. The meaning of those words lose strength when its brought up every single episode... As if the audience is too dumb to remember something that simple. Regardless it was cool to see them all united against the prisonguard and aggressive inmates. ( Taking beatings for each other ) This is not where the main problem is located.\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler:\\n\\n\r\n    The main problem that absolutely annihilates the whole show is episode 12. On Ep12, Ishihara ( Prison guard ) goes out of his way to attempt to kill sakuragi for always defying him. Ishihara has an obsession with sakuragi that goes beyond being a prisoner, because sakuragi makes him feel powerless. \\n\r\nWhen sakuragi was spotted on the outside world, ishihara wanted to pay him a visit. At this point ishihara had become a full on drug addict and completely lost his sanity. He had nothing to live for except killing sakuragi for who he accuses of ruining his life. \\n\r\nCue the stupidity. Ishihara confronts sakuragi and confesses his hate for him like many times before. Once ishihara is done monologuing, he pulls a gun on sakuragi with the intent to kill. Sakuragi saw this coming and disarms him. He now has the option of killing ishihara but doesnt because... well it would make him as bad as ishihara? It is never explained why he didnt. Sakuragi just continues to walk away and let ishihara attempt to kill him TWO MORE TIMES. The final being ishihara pulling a knife and stabbing him in the stomach. For some reason sakuragi didnt predict this like the other two times. Even though he should logically know ishihara would try to kill him again unlike the first time he pulled a gun. Anyways ishihara pulls the knife out like an idiot and continues to ignore ishihara and keep moving forward. American Military police stop sakuragi and tell him to drop the knife. He ignores this and keeps walking for ABSOLUTELY NO REASON. Sakuragi forces the police to kill him in the most forced death scene I have ever seen in anime. All sakuragi wanted was to get back to see the boxing event that his friend was fighting in. But instead of just killing ishihara or at least knocking him unconscious; he thinks its just a better idea to commit suicide. The only thing I can think of for not doing this is apparently sakuragi defines a \" man \" as someone that takes beatings. \\n\r\nYep getting his ass beat and never fighting back to defend yourself is what being a man is. Its only ok to beat up people if they attack your loved ones according to sakuragi.\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely ruined the anime, there is really no point in watching this clown fiesta.",

            "content": "Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin. This anime goes into the dark theme of seven teenagers forced to suffer for their crimes in a detention facility just after the WWII. The story follows these seven teenagers in trying to survive the cruelty of the warden and the detention center in general. The story progression may be a bit slow at times but it surely delivers. Story: 8/10\r\nThe theme of the art is generally dark which makes perfect sense for what it is trying to portray. The animation is superb and the style is very suiting. Art: 9/10\r\nThe sound, even though nothing too unique or amazing, waspretty enjoyable to say the least. Most of the soundtracks were suited for the occasion and used very well. Sound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the best part of this anime are the characters and character development. In terms of side-characters it may have been sub-par as side-characters weren't given too much attention and development. However, it more than made up for this fault by the development and illustration of the main characters, which there were seven of. As these characters are made to be real life like, you can relate to each one and would generally take a liking to most, if not all, of them. In terms of main characters, this anime does it especially well. Character: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of enjoyment, Rainbow certainly succeeded to keep me entertained throughout the series. It manages well to play well with your emotions where you would find yourself smiling whenever something pleasant happens, angered or sorrowed whenever during a woeful moment and sitting on the edge of your seat for the most part. Enjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend this anime? Yes, definitely a must-watch. Overall: 8.4/10",

Yet.....aren't we even allowed to dream'\r\nGrowing up and living in an environment where a struggle is present every moment of your life can only take a toll on ones psyche. You have no friends and  either have no family or, the family you have are troubled or distant from what they previously were. The only way to survive is by trusting no one but yourself as past experiences have dictated your innate perception of people. They are selfish and only get by; by looking out for themselves. Hate breeds hate, loneliness too does the same. This is theenvironment and setting of 'Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin 'or 'The Criminal Seven of Compound Two , Cell Six'.\\n\\n\r\nFor me this series had everything an anime enthusiast could ask for; a gripping story, character development and the right mixture of genres encompassing the life and times of the cast. This series on completion left me wanting more but, also gave utmost satisfaction at where it finished. Like any good series it grabbed me within the first episode. For me beginning a new series at times can be daunting as a number of them take a while to get into. Rainbow on the other hand excelled at the opposite. I was hooked!\\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoy the opening and ending themes of a series as they begin and end your viewing of an episode/series. Both themes were amazing and portrayed the themes and symbols of the series. 'We're not alone' by Coldrain starts the episode; the lyrics of the song encompass what those of the cast should be realizing. That you are not alone in this world and by standing together anything is possible. The ending is 'A far off distance' by Galneryus which is a reflective and a guitar wrenching powerballad showing the struggle and promise the cast have in life.\\n\\n\r\nTo keep me from rambling on i will be straight too the point with the remainder of the review.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was heartfelt, a tear jerker but at times it could be said a little too over emotional. However, looking back and taking all factors into account this was needed to show the effect that ones values can have on their life. For me the biggest let down of this anime in which everything was a 10/10, was the story as I longed for more. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound and Art will classed under Animetography; which i believe was one of the best aspects of the series. The detail in the facial expressions of the characters and settings would have to be up there with the best of series. As a viewer it really gave me a feel of the life the cast lived. The use of still  shots was also a key upside to this anime as it created a lasting impression something that at times would playback to you throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was fantastic encompassing mood perfectly and really setting the bar in terms of tempo and speed the anime progressed in. Overall both a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nKoyama Rikiya lead the cast of the series and showed why in my eyes he is one of the best in the business. Possibly some of the best voice actors i have heard take part in this series and really encompass what are individual brings to the table. Yet again 10/10\\n\\n\r\nImpression or enjoyment was also a 10/10. Like i said earlier the only let down was the anime actually ending.\\n\\n\r\nAs anime watchers i implore you to watch this series as it is one of the best stories to have come out of Japan in recent years. A tale of friendship and a never give up lifestyle encompass the series. Without giving detail or providing spoilers to the series i hope this persuades you into watching and getting your friends to watch as well. One of the key things about this anime is the lack of awareness people have to it.\\n\\n\r\n'We all wish to fly freely in the sky'",

This group of friends will try to survive to a very harsh environment, and their friendship will prove to be their biggest weapon.\r\nIn the 50s, Japan was really in a very poor state because of World War II, and this anime makes it a goal to really show the viewers a bit of how things were back then; how much injustice was all over and howhuman rights were violated daily, specially in a place like a reformatory. It was a hard life, and many people suffered a lot.\\n\\n\r\nOur characters are challenged by many difficulties, which of course, included the relation between them sometimes, but everything will end up making their ties stronger. Prison is, obviously, not a friendly place, and many thing will happen in there to make our main characters act in extreme ways.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an engaging series from the first moment. If you like it, you will probably get hooked immediately and until the end, making this a very enjoyable series.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is also a very big element here, and it's played beautifully, from the opening to the ending, going through some great insert songs and a glorious BGM consisting in various tunes. You can expect great things when you have Masafumi Mima as sound director (Full Metal Alchemist, NANA, Shingeki no Kyojin, among many).\\n\\n\r\nIf you like what we commonly refer to as GAR (very manly characters), you're coming to the right place, as many of our characters being great examples of it, specially Rokurouta Sakuragi, who is very well voiced by Rikiya Komaya (Kiritsugu in Fate/Zero, Kogoro from Detective Conan, Takamura from Hajime no Ippo), and is probably one of the finest examples of \"GAR\" you'll ever find.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is really good throughout the whole series, with Madhouse doing an extremely good job in pretty much every aspect of the anime. There are some cruel things shown, because, just like Madhouse makes it clear at the start of every episode, they really want to portray the atmosphere of that period.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is basically divided in two halves divided but a timeskip, with the first half being the clear superior one, but with the second one still being pretty solid.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half is mainly about the life of this group inside the reformatory and about how they forge such a great bond. The second half is more about their life after the reformatory, and how that friendship proves to be something unbreakable.\\n\\n\r\nBiggest problem in this anime would be the antagonists, who are guys that are so evil, that they really aren't that believable as characters, even if their reasons were actually pretty common in places like that. They're there to be hated, and they make them very \"hateable\"... to a fault.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime pretty hard to dislike, as it is pretty solid in every aspect, and maybe you can even get to learn a little bit about what is to be in a place that was devastated by war.\\n\\n\r\nMadhouse is already a studio full of great works, and Rainbow is among the very best of them.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Rainbow really is an anime of two halves. There is a tonal shift that happens about halfway through that completely changes the feel and the quality of the story. This is not a good thing in my opinion. Lets look at each half and assess its quality.\r\nThe story starts out in post-war Japan with a bunch of young delinquents being stuck in the same jail cell of a reformatory for young men. This half of the anime concentrates solely on the boys being subjected to some absolutely horrific treatment by the warden and one particular guard, whilst looking for an opportunity to escape. Now fairwarning, this portion of the story is REALLY DARK. Holy shit, it might be some of the darkest, most effed up stuff Ive ever seen in an anime!!! Without going into detail, it involves regular beatings, child rape, torture, and eventually straight up attempted murder. And the villains are portrayed in the most mindlessly evil way possible: by this i mean the way they're animated as snarling drooling demons basically, with no actual motivation for their actions other than \"these guys are are just pure evil\". In fact the vast majority of adults in Rainbow are portrayed as evil....so while some elements of the story feel faithful to the place and time, the portrayal of people is very cartoony, with little motivation for their actions. Basically, the young guys are good, the bad guys are pure evil. What im trying to get across is that Rainbow is not a subtle anime at all. Nevertheless, the first half is powerful, as we see these boy's friendship strengthen through their shared adversity. It feels a lot like \"Shawshank Redemption\" in this regard. \\n\\n\r\nNow, without spoiling it too much, eventually the boys leave the reformatory and try to make their way in the real world. This is basically the storyline for the entire second half of the series. This is where Rainbow falls flat in my opinion. The tone of the series changes drastically, with a lot more light hearted feel. Dont worry, there's still lots of beatings, just less paedophiles and kiddy rape. The leader of the boys ***SPOILER*** gets killed (in an absolutely ridiculous way it must be said), and this prompts each of the boys to decide what they want to do with their future. Now this sounds ok on paper, but the execution is so over the top dramatic and unrealistic it really makes your eyes roll. To give an example, one of the boys wants to become a singer. Fair enough, nothing wrong with that. However, the band he is apprenticing for decide for some reason that because he wants to become a singer he is their competition and that they must teach him a lesson by beating the crap out of him, threatening to pour mercury down his throat, and eventually trying to murder him. For absolutely NO REASON. Its contrived drama that just would never happen in real life. This is the over the top ridiculous cartoony tone of the series second half,and i feel it really suffers from this inept writing.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is generally and consistently really nice, to its credit it rarely looks low budget. Sound is also pretty good, and its got a killer opening theme song by Coldrain (reminiscent of Hunter x Hunter's epic metalcore opening). \\n\\n\r\nThose that applaud Rainbow as masterpiece are simply way off the mark. It explores some dark, horrific themes, that do reflect the hard times of post war Japan. But instead of a realistic portrayal, they went for over the top drama and torture porn. Basically its content is meant to shock, not to make a thought provoking point.",

            "content": "Another beautiful anime. Rainbow is truly an underrated gem that I happen to stumble upon and I was really amazed of how well everything is made in this anime and how well it showed the values of love, friendship and hope is very important in life.\r\nStory-10\r\nThe story is about teens who were sent to a detention facility where they meet a fellow inmate who changed they're lives for the better. Throughout the series this fellow inmate has been their inspiration to endure everything in life, move forward and shape their future.\r\nThe story is pretty simple and a little slow but it is delivered perfectly asthere are no loose ends throughout the series and everything is wrapped up perfectly in the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt-10\\n\r\nArt is amazing and animated very well with very vibrant colors.\\n\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\r\nThe music is very good especially joe's song which is a very powerful moment for his character and so are the sound effects and the dubbing of the voice actors as I could really feel the emotions every character is portraying and what the mood of the scene is.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-9\\n\r\nCharacters are amazing in this anime. I could not find any of the protagonists that I don't care about because they are presented as real human characters which could exist in real life. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series every protagonist is well fleshed out and none of them are really \"useless\" which many anime series fails at.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complain here is the lack of a good villain since all of them in the series are either not developed enough or a cliche very sinister looking/over the top \"evil bad guy type.\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\r\nThe series is very entertaining for me  and it is one of the only few shows that mad me shed manly tears of bot sorrow and joy.

            "content": "\"Even 1% would be enough for me.\"\r\n-Mario Minakami\r\nRainbow was a series I found completely by accident.  Perusing the top anime on MAL I was surprised to see something I hadn't even heard of.  It isn't necessarily popular, but most of those who have seen it seem to hold it in high regard.  After having the pleasure of watching Rainbow, I can fully understand the praise that many hold for it.  A slight disclaimer is to be had though, don't expect many victories in Rainbow.  Shows like this and Kaiji focus more on preserverance and the ultimate test of will tosend a powerful message to its viewers than relying on lighthearted comedy or fanservice.  It is certainly a poignant tale, and is one that will leave you with a strong sympathy for the characters it follows. \\n\\n\r\nRainbow, produced by the infamous Madhouse follows the lives of seven delinquents sent to a detention center in Japan sometime after World War II.  Right away I was intrigued by the uniqueness of the setting.  It felt rather refreshing to become immersed in a world so different than our own, where a country was riddled with foreigners and was trying to get back on its feet after the bomb that leveled Hiroshima.  It really puts the entire story into perspective when you know the fragility of the populace. The on-edge vibe that the passengers aboard the bus in the opening sequence gave towards the prisoners being transported to juvenile detention really hit the nail on the head.  At one point, one of the future protagonists attempts to return a stuffed animal dropped by a small child and is berated and ridiculed by the child's mother for doing so.  It just immersed the setting in a cold, apathetic veil that spoke volumes.\\n\\n\r\nRainbow held nothing back in its depictions of the beatings and mistreatings the 7 of them went through in their time at the detention center.  There were brutal beatings, forced suicides and sexual assaults among the horrendous acts committed by the faculty members within the reformatory.  Nothing is left unsaid with regard to the malpractice going on in the Shonan Special Reform school. The characters in Rainbow are all unique and justifiable in their own way.  I am grateful that Madhouse decided to slate the series for 26 episodes vice 12 or 13, because I don't think the proper amount of development could have gone into 7 different characters with that few of episodes.  Initially the group was on guard and rather stand-offish towards one another, but grew closer due to the constant struggles they underwent in the juvenile detention center.  Sakuragi, the eventual leader of the outcasts served as the ultimate pariah, and often took the beatings for the group's wrongdoings.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I said there aren't many victories to expect, the first half of the series really emphasizes this. Thrown into literal squalor, the 7 delinquents all vary in personality and background, which makes their assimilation all the more interesting. You have a Hiroshima survivor, a thief and an almost innocent soul who all end up in the same figurative undertow, and their treatment can make more squeamish individuals cower in nausea. Unfortunately I can't help but come to the realiztion that their treatment was relatively common in those days.  If you do a little research back to the 40's, Japan was so fragile that you could break souls of the populace by touching them.  Everyone was on edge from defeat, and being an American gave me an interesting perspective while watching the show.  I've seen retrospective anime before, but few truly illustrate the environment better than Rainbow does.  It's truly an immersive experience.\\n\\n\r\nI won't give too much away when it comes to the plot, but what I will say is that it brought a grown man to tears.  There are many powerful, emotional moments in this series, and some that truly left me at a loss for words.  And it is truly a tale of two halves.  The first half is dark and treacherous, while the second offers a glimmer of hope, personified by the golden finch that flies about in the show's OP.  The second half almost seemed like a different anime entirely, but it was warranted based on how the characters were treated in the first half.  Truly showing how a detention center can shape one's mind, the kids in Rainbow had a difficult time adjusting to society upon leaving the institution.  I kept saying when the show was elapsing, \u201cwhy aren't more anime like this?\u201d Too many times, shows rely on stale comedy, recycled ideas and perverted ecchi to get their views.  The industry is starting to become watered down and are losing their charm.  Diehard fans really need more shows like Rainbow to instill a sense of hope for future anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Rainbow is actually rather small, considering there are 7 main protagonists.  Among the main protagonists, Mario was by far my favorite, and he received more depth than anyone.  His history, and emulation of Sakuragi was uncanny and really made you root for him.  It's often said that desperation brings out the best in people, and in Mario's case this is true.  To respect someone enough to have your own body crippled in return for their salvation speaks volumes for your character.  Having the friends of a lifetime also helps though, as Mario's fellow cell mates rose from the ashes together. I loved watching the stories of Turtle and Joe unfold.  Joe was so desperate to reunite with his sister that it seemed his persistence for stardom was more for her than him.  He was a selfless sould who sell his own body if it meant he could one day see his sister again. I also enjoyed seeing some backstory on Uncovered, since his eventual cooperation was what saved Sakuragai from dying within the confines of the facility.  I can definitely relate with his struggles being dirt poor.  I grew up not knowing where my next meal would come from, and sometimes we end up hurting those we love the most out of confusion and frustration. I wished more development would've existed with Soldier, as he was the only major character without an episode or two devoted to him in the second half, but with a 26 episode limit, somebody had to get slighted.\\n\\n\r\nIshihara, the main guard of the detention center assigned to the 7 delinquents certainly did his best to act the part.  There are few characters in anime I have ever wanted to rip through the screen and strangle... but Ishihara definitely takes the cake. There were small issues I had with the rest of the cast, including the PTSD Turtle experienced so late after the events at Hiroshima.  Granted I'm not a medical expert, but it seemed awful convnient for his symptoms to start right when his dual episode after story was due to air.  Also, I'm curious as to what kind of doctor would be able to repair a disintegrated hand so flawlessly and allow him to fight full strength in a boxing match in such a short amount of time.  Not to mention the fact that this anime took place in the 1940's.  Nevertheless, these are just minor issues, and nothing to change my overall opinion of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOk, we can all admit that Rainbow's OP is incredible.  There is a running playlist of anime music I have on youtube which I rarely add to, but I definitely made an exception for this song.  The lyrics cried in angst, redemption and hopefulness, and I loved the way it opened each episode. The ED was also really powerful in its own right, and I urge you to look up the lyrics for it.  There wasn't much else in the anime as far as music is concerned, but not much felt out of place.  One thing I will mention is the random reiteration of the OP song with a still image of scenery after each time the OP plays.  I've never seen this in an anime, and I still don't quite understand why it existed.  Minor complaint, but odd nonetheless.  I've been flippant when it comes to English voice acting in subbed anime before, and I won't hold my tongue for Rainbow either.  Voicing a white American with an obviously incorrect voice makes me cringe.  Can we stop doing this already?  Those of you that have seen this series will know exactly what I'm talking about.  An aryan guy voiced by a token black actor is just ridiculous.  Ishihara's voice actor deserves an award though, the guy played his part perfectly, and his voice deteriorated at the same rate of Ishihara's own soul.  A job well done.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I quite enjoyed the experience I had with watching Rainbow Nisha.  I would recommend this anime to just about anyone, especially those fond of atypical or historic genres.  Fans of Kaiji, Baccano or older setting shows would feel right at home with it.  It takes a lot to make me cry in an anime, but Rainbow got me damn close with an important character death.  Man that was hard to watch.  I wish studios would step out on a limb more like with adapting Rainbow and other shows not fitting the current anime stereotypes.  Thanks as always for reading, and be sure to check out my reviews of the Spring 16 anime lineup!",

My biggest problem was that the characters and story were all pretty shallow, and seemed to count on some of its shock value type moments to grab the viewer emotionally rather than really building up an emotional attachment. It just felt like \"oh, some stuff's happening to some guys,\" basically. It does improve eventually though, enough that I suppose I don't mind having finished it after all.\r\nI think for the story,there was just too much they tried to pack in to show everybody's individual story. There just wasn't any time to get attached to what was happening.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound were both good, but not really so much so that I feel there's much else to say about them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- they just perpetually felt like they were almost good, almost sincere, almost engaging. There were a few scattered moments where I started to think maybe they were finally flushing out better, but it just didn't happen.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed a few bits of it, but it definitely wasn't something that I was sad to see end.",

There is an extraoridinary amount of development with it's plot and a sense of great brotherly love.\r\nThe art, is amazing. Since Rainbow (the manga) was written a while ago, there is a look and feel about it characteristic to that era,however, the animators for this series have successfully reinvented it while keeping it true to both the manga and the times, giving it a freshfeel and keeping it remarkably consistent.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is amazing. The opening and closing themes really connect with the viewer and I believe 'wraps' the while feel of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are one of the great highligts of the anime. Here is where we find the wealth of character development and extraordinary eyeopeners where the journey taken by the main protagonists really lets us have connections and favourites. Really developing each characters individual traits and personalities that lend so much wealth to the show, rather than making another weird psycopathic seinen throwaway anime.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series, I think that is very apparent from the review and I recommend it to anyone at all, because in truth, this series is a truly heartwarming story of a friendship, love and the conquering of insurmountable odds. 10/10",

It'll be my first review, so please be forgiving.\r\nStory - 7\r\nThe story has been pretty predictable from the start, but was still enjoyable until a certain twist at the middle of the series. After that incident, everything went just how one would predict it, so there is no actual suspense or thrill. Every characters get his little arc which always ends with happy end. I must admit, the plot is unique, but the implementation couldbe much better, it had the potential.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\\n\r\nAside from the stiff character designs, the art is pretty good. The background characters don't really move and there are some still images every episode, but overall the art does help us empathizing with the era of the anime. Far from the best work from Madhouse, but the art is still one of the best points of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much background musics, so they are overused, and the sound effects are just what you would expect from any other anime. The seiyuus are overall doing a good job, but there are some newbies (like the main character's), whose voices are too stiff and can't really speak with feelings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6\\n\\n\r\nThere are bad guys and good guys. Bad guys are always ugly, so if you see an ugly guy in the anime, he is bad for sure. Good guys are always good, they don't have any flaws, they always love their buddies over everything else. That's about it. The main characters can be categorized into stereotypes, and there is hardly anything unique about them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall - 7\\n\\n\r\nDon't be fooled by the unique premise, this is no more than a mediocre show with below par characters and predictable story. As to who I would recommend it to; propably the people who have had enough of the \"moe\" and \"fanservice\" shows, and want something \"dark\", no matter how the anime actually is. I won't say that it's the worst show of the year, but propably the biggest disappointment. For me, at least.",

            "content": "Rainbow: Nisha Rokubo no Shichinin is a historical drama written by Abe George. The anime adaptation was handled by Madhouse with the adaptation writing handled by Takayashiki Hideo. It hasn't been that long since I watched a  Madhouse production, with April's look at One Outs being the last. This is an anime I've never really heard anything about and, given that Madhouse's quality varies significantly, I can't begin to predict how this might rate. We'll just have to take a look and see.  \r\nStory: \r\nThe narrative opens with six men, faces obscured by hoods, being taken on a bus ride with an armedguard. They arrive at a reform school where they're going to be kept locked up for a couple years. They're locked in a cell with another boy named Sakuragi, who they quickly grow to respect. The boys get along, but all is not well. The Reform school has some disturbing secrets that they're going to have to either overcome or learn to survive in spite of. \\n\\n\r\nI'll start with the negative aspect. Yes, that is negative singular. The story has a narrator. That isn't bad in and of itself, but the problem lies in the execution. Mainly, the narrator doesn't really do anything. You're probably expecting me to give the old \u201cshow don't tell\u201d line, but the series does both. The narrator will tell you how a character is feeling after the narrative itself has made that information clear. She'll also summarise plot points that the narrative has either just covered or is about to. As such, the narrator just ends up being redundant and pointless. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I really appreciate about Rainbow is the handling of dark subject matter. It's all too common for this kind of content to be used for cheap shock value, angst or in an otherwise superficial way by a writer trying to be \u201cmature and edgy\u201d while possessing less maturity than your average twelve year old. In this series, the dark content is uncomfortable and can be very hard to watch because it's handled so well. The series deals with a realistic portrayal of the very worst of humanity and with how to respond to it. I also like that the characters don't find easy resolutions. Instead, they deal with these situations as best as they can and, sometimes, they fail in spite of it. When a new problem comes up you never know if the resolution is going to be tragic, bittersweet, or triumphant but you can count on it having verisimilitude. The uncertainty does help the story stay compelling. I also like the way the narrative flows. It progresses very naturally from one situation to the next while giving you ample time to adjust and wind down before entering into the next conflict. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this are superlative. The main characters are all good people, but far from perfect. They falter. They make mistakes and they do things that they shouldn't. Their mistakes and problems all make sense for their characters, which makes the conflicts resulting from them feel very natural. They're complex characters who develop and grow throughout the series. It never feels forced nor contrived.  Even the antagonists feel like actual people. Terrible people mind you, but not exaggeratedly evil or cartoonish. The character interactions are spectacular. The seven main protagonists have a really strong camaraderie dynamic and they play off of each other very strongly.  \\n\\n\r\nI do like that the main characters never cross the moral line. They do some things that are  illegal, but it's always understandable. Sometimes, it's even the right thing to do. At their very worst, their actions are well intentioned but misguided which does happen to good, moral people quite frequently. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThe art  is very good with some nice details and memorable character designs. The creepy scenes with dark content are animated in a way that highlights how horrible what's happening is. The biggest problem with it is the strange coloured effect they like to use during freeze frames. It would work well if they used it rarely for emphasis, but it pops up far too much for it to work in that capacity. Consequently, it quickly starts to feel like a measure to save on the animation budget instead of like an aspect that's doing something. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThe vocal cast is stellar. Our seven protagonists are played by Paku Romi, Koyama Rikiya, Fujiwara Keiji, Kuroda Takaya, Hasome Tatsuya, Oguri Shun & Waki Tomohiro. The last three of whom I have not heard in much, if anything, aside from this. All of them do deliver very strong performances. As do the minor and secondary characters. This is also one of the few times I've seen an anime where they have American characters speak English with an American accent. Usually when you have characters who are supposedly foreign they still have pronounced Japanese accents. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is pretty good. Most of the time it's barely noticeable, fading into the background. The big exceptions are moments that are quiet otherwise and the scenes where Jou sings. The music does work well for those moments. \\n\\n\r\nHo-Yay: \\n\\n\r\nRainbow does touch on homosexuality, primarily with one of the antagonists who does not buy into the idea of consent. You could probably read it into some of the relationships among the main seven as well, but I really see their dynamics as more of a strong camaraderie. So, the ho-yay factor is a 3/10. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: \\n\\n\r\nRainbow: Nisha Rokubo no Shichinin is an excellent series. It's a complex work that handles dark content maturely, which is sadly rare with dark works. The cast is excellent, both in terms of characters and vocally. The biggest problem with the series is the pointless narrator and it's really not a huge issue. That being said, it does have some very chilling depictions of sexual abuse and violence. If that's going to be triggering or hugely upsetting for you, you're probably going to want to steer clear. My final rating is going to be a 9/10. Next week, get your popcorn ready. It's time for films.",

            "content": "We as Americans have a different sort of drama preference. And of all these preferences, there is one that sticks to my mind. Shawshank Redemption, Prison Break, Green Mile, all these fantastic dramas have one thing in common: prison. Prison is naturally going to pull American viewers in, but why, I don't know. Perhaps its the despair people feel when they are stripped of everything, even their dignity, and how they struggle to survive in their hostile environment. Or maybe its the strong bonds created through prisoners holding on to hope by sharing it with prisoners who understand the pain and sorrow. Whatever the casemay be, Rainbow is nothing short of a great prison drama.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows six youths sent to prison for multiple different reasons. After being violated by the prison doctor Dr. Sasaki and assulated by the psychotic guard Ishihara, they are thrown into a prison sell with a man named Sakaragi. After picking a fight with him and epic-ly losing, Sakaragi and the boys begin to build an unbreakable bond as they struggle to survive, since underneath the surface a horrible secret is being kept by Dr. Sasaki and Ishihara that Sakaragi knows, and if they let him escape alive it would them who are prison. The story is quite graphic and harsh, and may take a mature person to watch. Other than that, the story does wonders in the drama category providing very touching moments as well as tragic. However, every dram should have comic relief, and although Rainbow has it, its very minimal in comparison to the point where it becomes very depressing. This is not a big deal, however, since its so dramatic. Now, the show slows down a little early in the second half, but this doesn't mean it lacks any nice moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very nice and has an old-fashioned feel to it for me. Its very clean and simple, and dark tones are used throughout in order to intensify the \"darkness\" of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was a bit weird for me. The BGMs were the main reason. It didn't really match with the story for me, and although they were nice by themselves, for some reason it ruined the mood for me. HOWEVER, the OP and ED are a completely different story. The OP was badass, and during the chorus you instantly get a feel of sorrow and almost a foreshadowing of what's to come. The ED sends you off in a way that says that they are \"never givin' up\", and the vocals themselves leave a singer like me pissed off for being as sucky as I am.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are phenomenal. Each character (except for Soldier...) has a big part somewhere in the show, and back stories are explained nicely. Honestly, there isn't anything to complain about, it was a superb job.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a personal favorite of mine is a must-see for drama seekers looking for a different kind of drama. Rainbow pulls the curtain off a hidden reality of crudeness and evil in the world, and how, ironically, the young men in prison struggle against it despite their differences in power and wealth. Its truly a great show, and I highly recommend it.",

            "content": "What exactly is friendship? Are your friends more important to you than your family? What are you willing to go through for a friend? Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin (for the rest of the review the anime will be referred to simply as Rainbow) focuses on friendship, as well as several other themes based around friendship, such as humanity, morality, violence, love, family etc. This is my review:\r\nStory - Rainbow is a tale about seven inmates in a special reform school who grow closer with the increased time they spend together. All seven of them are there for committing several crimes which shaped these verydifferent yet very similar individuals. From the opening moments of the first episode right through to the last scene of the last episode I was hooked. The show grabbed me and forced me to sit down and watch what happened next. Rainbow is brutal, mature, dark and at times depressing. But I was surprised at how light the show can get at certain points, from the funny banter between the seven inmates to the way they overcome obstacles by relying on each other and their bond. The tone shifts from time to time but Rainbow manages to keep the shifts fluid and smooth. For me, Rainbow had two highlights, and the story was definitely one of them. The writing was well done because the show didn't come off as melodramatic and managed to feel really inspirational at certain points and there were more twists than one would expect from a show like this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - I mentioned that the show had two aspects that really stood out. The characters were the second aspect.  These were really cool guys. They were bad ass but they were portrayed in such a sympathetic way that you would root for all of them, sort of like multi-layered anti-heroes. The story was really amazing but I really enjoyed seeing the guys react to the situations they found themselves in. Character driven stories always work when it's executed properly. Like I said their friendship is an intricate part of the story. It is tested time and time again. It's wonderful to see selfless friendship like the one showed here. If you have a best friend or an entire \"entourage\" that you'll take a bullet for you'll know what I'm talking about. Two characters took a back seat to the others sometimes but that didn't detract from how enjoyable Rainbow was.\\n\\n\r\nSound - The voice acting was fantastic with each character sounding like they ought to. It is a lot more difficult to illustrate chemistry between animated characters than live-action characters but once again Rainbow manages to pull it off. There are a couple of bonuses available in the form of short clips with some the show's shows voice actors  and I must say I really found new respect for seiyuus. The OP is probably not for everyone. A heavy metal track will turn some off but in my opinion it fitted well with the tone and atmosphere of the show. Listen to it and you'll know what to expect. The rest of the OST wasn't very bad and after listening to \"A FAR OFF DISTANCE\" I just had to get it on my phone.\\n\\n\r\nArt - Rainbow's art is really good. I'm not an artist so I don't know how to explain it in detail but it's not too shabby. The art is very realistic like seinen should be. There are no alterations to characters' facial expressions for Japanese slapstick and like the voice acting, the art of each inmate fits to their personality and who they are.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - A part of me wishes that I didn't see Rainbow because after watching it, it'll be hard to find another series that will be able to top the standard Rainbow set. The story is brutal and violent, but also sincere and inspirational. The characters are extremely likeable and their relationship can get one emotional. Lump in throat emotional. The voice acting and soundtrack sound great and the art is beautiful. George Abe and Masumi Kakizaki really managed to create a distinctive style here.\\n\\n\r\nRainbow is a fantastic character driven story chronicling the lives of seven inmates who became best friends. The show is not for the weak of heart but please give it a try, you'll be surprised how much you love it. \\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nWho said anime was just for kids?",

            "content": "This anime prove that the anime and manga are an art in itself and can challenge all persons denying this fact. This anime is a masterpiece.\r\nFirst, talking about the opening, it\u2019s beautiful, the lyrics are beautiful, the instrument smashes, and what I liked the most in this opening is the metaphor linked to Canary : our 7 inmates compared to canaries in the series, here I can see is that even the bird emblem of the freedom of its wings from heaven, the free world to land on barbed wire, prison, detention, as our hero and eventually fly away and returns to the free worldthat is the Sky, so yes this opening spoil the story but on predictable things.\\n\r\nThis is the story of six prisoners, young prisoners, all jailed for stupid reasons, they can recall our Jean Val Jean (Hero of the miserable masterpiece of  Victor Hugo), imprisoned for stealing bread, it's a bit like that for our protagonists.\\n\r\nThese six young men, these six kids encounter in this reformer , their eldest and with him the prison violence provided by prison guards and all human faces, and together face adversity that it will come out, the friendship between men, that is all that remains to them and they therefore form any strong links especially around Anchan (Their oldest).\\n\r\nBesides the serious story, sad and full of injustices, as the past character I loved this universe all are important, even if their past painful it is participating in the construction of their personality, you need to know what feeling, or that we learn the ugly past of our favorite character and we're disgusted to him we would not have wanted him to live that but at the same time without this painful past it wouldn\u2019t  be our favorite character, and although there it is this feeling multiplied by seven, seven times this frustration is that you dove into the universe and that is the strong point of the series, the character development.\\n\\n\r\nSo this anime deserves a big 10/10 and even will deserve more. Personally,  I would say it\u2019s one of the best anime I've seen any category, it is so real and so human. It\u2019s a great mix of emotion, struggle  and drama. This anime will for sure make you cry (It made me cry several times,seriously get a Kleenex box if you watch it XD), so real, so earthly cruel, so true, so touching, so captivating that you mustn\u2019t skip it.",

All these things were brilliantly selected for that Anime.\r\nHowever, I admit that Anime is aboutreal life,real people you can meet. Anime shows the cruelty,madness,egoism,injustice of people and our world. And sure , it shows the NATURAL FRIENDSHIP between friends trying to struggle with that Mad and Idiotic environment them live in. All friends have dreams them want to be completed! Nobody can stop them !NO BO DY !\\n\\n\r\nTHE MORAL IS : Always Follow your dream ,even your way will be very extremely hard and F***ING long.\\n\\n\r\nNo comments...Just watch...",

Each of the main cast gets plenty of development and actually feel like real people instead of just walking stereotypes. By the end of the anime, you care about each one of the characters so much, that you feel as if they were you own brothers.\r\nPretty much it contains everything that is good about anime without falling into many of the pot-holes. There are \"gooder than good\" characters but they actually have tosuffer because of it just like people have to suffer in real life for sticking to their morals. Women in this show are actual real people instead of just being glorified eye-candy. The supporting cast has their own ambitions and goals instead of just following the main character around like a flock of idiots.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the art goes, its a little bit old school but that just adds to the charm if you ask me. The only thing i rated under a 10 is the music which i put at a 9, however it's anything but bad. Truly outstanding anime which I have not seen a the like of ever.",

            "content": "[Remake review]\r\nRainbow is one of those animes that are considered devalued or \"cult\". For not having moeshit, school or anything. The scene in which rainbow is happening, is a scenario not very common animes, and for this reason did not call so much attention. But such an anime in my view should have been popular because the anime is edgy and has a lot of violence, psychopathic / one-dimensional villains. These are things that makes it a popular title, but for some reason this anime has been forgotten or devalued.\r\nNow let's talk about the story of rainbow: The story of rainbow is simply shit. Thenarrative is very slow, and it begins by making mistakes. Like for example: To give flashbacks to its characters in the first episodes, being these flashbacks very exaggerated and forced. It's the usual cheap emotional manipulation ever. But believe me, it gets much worse. The more we advance, the more we discover that conflict and drama are pathetic. Conflict is unilatreal in black and white. On one side we have the characters super cute and pacifists, on the other side the super bad psychopaths. It is a kind of childish and pathetic plot. You believe all the drama is idiot edgy, because all the drama of this shit is basically torture and misery, and end. And the worst thing is that this drama would be non-existent if the characters used their fists on the psychopathic villains, but no. They prefer to be tortured because they are a saint and a complete idiot. It is because of this stupidity of these characters that one of the characters died. And what makes the anime even more childish, is its dialogues. The dialogues are just awful. Most of the dialogues are those typical friendship speeches of any shounen.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's it. Rainbow is basically this. Torture and misery of characters who are a saint vs. psychopathic villains who live by abusing them. There is nothing special about this story. It's just victimization and forced drama, with characters without much personality that only has flashbacks.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing to praise in this anime are the production values. The production values \u200b\u200bare very mature. The atmosphere is very appropriate. and focus on the total in that. Without getting you down with comedy slapstick or other generic shit. Otherwise, it's a pathetic and edgy story with absolutely nothing special, besides being very boring, childish and edgy.\\n\\n\r\nTorture has never been a good drama, stop it. Please",

This anime is definitely a masterpiece. I\u00b4d say it\u00b4s even better than steins;gate but Steins;gate is still my Number 1, only because Rainbow doesn\u00b4t hype me just as much. Otherwise, this  would be at #1. This seemingly neverending tragic story, the beautiful friendship of the main characters, the really\"fucked up\" moments even, the courage and fighting spirit that all of the characters show and the amazing moral and wiseness this story brings make this anime truly spectacular. The fact that the story is based on actual happenings in said time, makes it even more incredible. 10/10 easy. Definitely a must-watch.",

            "content": "Story:          \r\n          This series is a mixture of shounen and seinen. The story is about 6 teen boys that are brought into a prison-like disciplinary school where they meet Sakuragi Rokurota, a boy year or two older than them. And with Sakuragi's help who they call \"bro\" their inner core will come to light and turn them into solid men. It has a lot of comical parts, action and struggle. But everything is done in convincing and realistic approach. \r\nArt:The Graphics are not really striking but not so bad (The villains are really ugly!). There are times that the character's appearances are not consistent. However, The scenery, backgrounds, and the general time setting the story occurs in was shown as you would have imagined it during the war era. \\n\\n\r\nSound/Music\\n\r\n          There is lot of good music throughout the anime. I really like the song \u201cDear Night Rainbow\u201d. The music corresponds with the dramatic scene. (That scene really made me cry). The japanese dub is very well made and features voice actors such as Romi Paku, Fujiwara Keiji and Oguri Shun who all did an impressive work on their characters and conveyed out their temperament even further. The narrator though is kinda lacking.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\n           The characters are all interesting. The main characters have resilient and distinct traits, with quite a bit of character progress and background. The minor characters are equally plausible.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\n         I really enjoyed this anime. It's a powerful story that shows great friendship and sacrifice. a mature story that is both harsh and idealistic\\n\\n\r\nNote: The anime covered only 100 chapters of the Manga.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nRainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin is often described as realistic, dark or even deep. It\u2019s none of that. This is a show heavily driven by an unrealistic bond of friendship that wasn\u2019t properly formed, but still exists. The writing isn\u2019t smart, don\u2019t expect a story that keeps you at the edge of your seat, but enjoy a tale of friends trying to bounce up when life wants them to stay down. \r\n Tldr, this has so many plot holes and thoughtlessly handled situations that could of easily been avoided, but I really enjoyed the slice of life aspect of the show. Goodcharacters, development was well done. Really enjoyable series despite it\u2019s thoughtless advances. Soundtrack is amazing, now up there with my favorite anime soundtracks. Aesthetics were good, nothing to complain, but also nothing to praise. \\n\\n\r\nAfter watching a scene I usually write some thoughts down about it, if I have any. I tried to format them into a review as best as I could. This isn\u2019t a recommendation so if you haven\u2019t seen the anime and are still reading them please don\u2019t, I go into detail about the anime so I will spoil it for you. \\n\\n\r\nMASSIVE SPOILERS BEYOND THIS. \\n\\n\r\nJoe committed a crime so his voice doesn\u2019t hold much credibility, but is that enough to cover up the way he was treated by the foster lady. Not only did she break a vase in his face, but almost stabbed him, while he accused her of molesting him. And this all happened in front of authorities too. Why was nothing done to her. In one hand, the inmates are framed as the ugliest of criminals who\u2019ve committed the worst things imaginable, you\u2019d ought to put these highly dangerous scums of earth in a secure place where they can be properly conducted. Even so, their system is a joke. The guards, get away with so much crap despite how powerless they act at times. \\n\\n\r\nWhen the Ishihara tells Uncovered that Sakuragi was in there for killing his own parents Uncovered wasted no time to react, immediately making a scene without questioning anything. Uncovered seems to be the reserved type, he doesn't want to get attached to the group, but he's also supposed to be the 'smart' one, not very smart of him to be impulsive instead of being reasonable. Later on in the episode he tells Sakuragi that he's sick of being in the same room as him, why so much hostility towards someone he barely knows. The irony in all this is how Uncovered, who babbles so much hatred towards people for being selfish, becomes what he hates the most, a selfish scum who sells out good people that bothered to show interest in him only to save himself from a beating. Irony truly is a gift.  \\n\\n\r\nNow we know why Sakuragi is in the reformatory school. He goes into further detail with the nurse \"My... father died... At my hands. I... killed him.\" Quoted from the subs. But wait, in the flashback, never once did he lay a hand on his father, who committed suicide. Even though prior to this episode,  Ishihara tells Uncovered the reason Sakuragi is in there was because he killed his own parents. Now you can say Ishihara twisted his words in order to get Uncovered to hate Sakuragi, but how are we supposed to know he was doing that? So when hearing he killed his own parents, I thought maybe his parents were scumbags so their murder will be justified, but he DIDN'T kill his father, he just feels responsible. His ability to put himself in his father's perspective sprinkles a little growth to his character. He understood his father's guilt for surviving a war that had killed five of his sons. He understood how tough it was to find work at the time. He understood how difficult it must of been to blend into a new society. He now understood his father's suffering, but it was too late. A bit melodramatic, but serves a point so I'll take it.\\n\\n\r\nI think this anime is interesting so I've been trying to ignore how easily they became the best of buddies, but the show makes it really hard with all the exaggerated friendship moments. \\n\\n\r\nSome people may not agree, but I think Ishihara-Sasaki duo calls for some properly written villains. The corrupt Ishihara who sells prisoners in exchange for money and the perverted doctor who rapes them. They depict a selfish nature that unfortunately exists in our world, corrupted law enforcement in Mexico is quite common and just a couple weeks ago a doctor was convicted of abuse on over a hundred cases. While I do think the writers could of done better, they did enough to justify the harsh treatment they are giving Sakuragi. This shines a more humane emotion, at least towards Ishihara, fear. The fear of losing power and credibility he's earned himself. The fear of a cold, terrorizing glare of an inmate. He's not invincible and he knows that, this draws forth the agony of Sakuragi being released and ruining him. Initially I thought this all fell apart when Ishihara begins injecting himself with drugs and becomes insane. But after looking back, it kinda makes sense. See, Sakuragi promises Ishihara one day he will make him wish he was dead towards the beginning of the show, this was because Ishihara caused his friend to kill himself and Sakuragi most likely wanted to avenge his good pal. Ishihara is driven insane by this promise, starts pumping drugs into himself (probably in order to distract him from his fear of Sakuragi) and wishing Sakuragi would just kill him once and for all. Sakuragi fulfilled his promise! Cheeky bastard. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the biggest cuck, Sakuragi\u2019s death. ecksfuckingdee bois. I didn't really care for Sakuragi much tbh. He didn't stand-out as anything unique in anyway. So I\u2019m not even being biased about them killing him off. Surely my anger is justified when the idiot gets himself killed. Now I'm a nice guy, I can look passed him giving the demented Ishihara the letter despite it being the only leverage they have to keep the guys still inside jail safe. He also didn't kill him even when he was stabbed, ok I'm still chill. Now the idiot keeps on walking when he is ordered to stay still. The good guys of nippon telling him it's for his own benefit to stay down since he is bleeding out, then the big bad americanos come and shred the guy to pieces BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T STAY STILL. LOL! Why didn't he stop! Was he bleeding out so badly he couldn't think straight anymore? I need something other than he wanted to see Mario win, what a big fucking joke. Also why was he even in the reformatory school? He didn\u2019t kill his parents, plot hole. \\n\\n\r\nHappy to say, the show picks itself up a bit in the second half. Just a little. \\n\\n\r\nSakuragi's death proves itself a necessity to the plot. Without it there would only be a cycle of cat and mouse between Ishihara/Sasaki and the gang; mainly towards Sakuragi. Still can't forgive the thoughtless way they killed him though. \\n\\n\r\nQueue the overused black and white scene:\\n\r\nSome drunk guy's being a drunk guy trying to get out of paying his tab on the bar, harassing the poor defenseless bartender. Time for Mario to show us his heroic skills. He gives the guy two free hits and then kicks his ass, I wonder where this forced scene will take us. OH, the drunk guy's back with the cops! Mario's busted bois. It's not like the drunk guy deserved it for 1. being drunk, 2. Assaulting the bartender, 3. Hitting Mario first, TWICE. But you know, Mario still has to take the bullet for it to move the plot along. It\u2019s jail time bois, get the soap ready. Naw dawg, this show isn\u2019t having that, which is a good thing, they did a good thing. I\u2019d have a hard time enjoying the show if they basically repeated the first half of the show again. They didn\u2019t though, they moved on to more mundane human affairs, this is where the show begins to entertain me.  \\n\\n\r\nSoldier shows intelligence, he shows determination. He had a goal that he worked towards and learned from it. He was even able to get out of the school earlier because of this. Same goes for Uncovered, but we already knew that from the way they perfectly handled him towards the beginning of the show.\\n\\n\r\n\"This guy's the biggest dumbass in all of Japan...\" - Soldier \\n\\n\r\nUncovered is all about the irony, again. I love this guy! We've all seen it before, the smart guy falls in love for the chick who's only toying with him. The show wastes no effort in letting it's audience know what's going on, as the above quote reads, Soldier calls him an idiot while he beats the shit outta him. Now again, props to Soldier for taking action in such a way; I know I'd wanna punch him for spending the money he borrowed from me like that. To me, it's not about using cliches or not, but how you present them. In the end, Uncovered wasn't angry at her, he wasn't sad he was played with. He couldn't feel sad, he knew nothing about her, it was nothing personal. He put himself in her perspective, it must of been horrible for her to be unable to ever find happiness. And it really must be horrible, that's something anyone can relate to.\\n\\n\r\nGod, that last episode was so fucking beautiful. Boxing was a big theme in this show, Sakuragi did a number on all six at their first encounter cause he was a boxer, this introduces Mario to boxing. It also played the stupid role in getting Sakuragi killed. Now Mario, the successor of Sakuragi, stands in the ring with all his friends watching, as well as the side characters that appeared throughout the show (we missed Setsuko unfortunately). Then the tree scene, which even though we all knew what his wish was, still provides enough closure. \\n\\n\r\nThe show had many small arcs, which are also properly paced,  I give this props. They could of just played cat and mouse as I've said before, but no. Instead they played with different scenarios each time with another character in focus, sometimes things went their way, sometimes they didn't. There is no overpowered foe that comes back again and again, each time invincibly stronger. The hardest part is over in the first half, now outside of the reformatory school they are free men, who are trying to do something with their lives. I wish a little more screen time would of been dropped on Soldier which, to me, showed the most promise, but oh well. \\n",

            "content": "This show is a tease, with bait so delectable that you can't think twice when you dive for it. You have 6 mysterious characters who have caused some sort of mayhem to be sent to prison. Are some of the characters wrongfully accused? Are some of them actual madmen? You have this dark setting to go along with scenes that are mostly visual, the animation tells the story. I was thinking to myself how brilliant it was, the possibilities of what they could do. Then 15 minutes passed, and, review below\r\n The 6, which is now 7 characters are good guys. Not Protagonists, butgood guys, meaning they will risk their lives for anything at the drop of hat in a 5 second encounter with a stranger . I was expecting the main guys to be more dimensional, some would be cowards, some are desperate scum, one could actually have a lust for hurting others, and one could be generic nice guy that realizes reality isn't as kind. However, everything in this show is black and white. \\n\\n\r\nThe 7 of them form an immediate bonding friendship for life, and the thought of characters learning about each other is sort of ruined by the narrator. This show is just 20 minutes of Bro! Bro! Anchan! Bro! Anchan! With all of their crimes being justified by how overly cruel their obstacle was. The \"Survival of the fittest,\" motto they shoved at us was nulled by their friendship, and for some reason most of the episodes take place after their prison release. 7 characters in prison? That's enough material for 26 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nStory-\\n\\n\r\nNot bad, 7 people in prison that must deal with all the cruelty that comes.\\n\\n\r\nArt- \\n\\n\r\nVery grainy, dark, and somewhat detailed. Not bad for what the show was going for, or trying to go for\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nNot much music, which is sometimes good. Great for this show, but the few songs were very intense sounding, and not to my taste.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-\\n\\n\r\nThese characters are very boring. They don't offer anything new or creative, and in this kind of setting, that's where most of the focus should have been on. How they deal with their new life, and mostly, each other. But we're granted with preachy, goody kids that were just in a pickle of a situation, and made a mistake. A mistake the anime tries to justify so hard. It's like if someone stole an apple for his starving village that's about to be flooded. Some characters can be nicety nice nice, but there should have been more variety. Have some depth, and insight on pathetic scum who would abandon people to save self or others who just enjoy causing others pain. It's a lot more interesting then mindless Yugioh friendship drones. \\n\\n\r\nOh the villain is my favorite character. They made them as ugly, sinister, creepy, and crazy as possible. I wouldn't be surprised if they gave them razor sharp teeth, and nervous twitches oh wait. In most cases, these villains would be very boring, but they're so over the top that it seems like a parody. One of them is the prison doctor who gets his sexual desires out of alien probing younger kids. The other is an asshole, because he's an asshole, and that's it. That's the villain, no second thought if it's actually the warden or the inmates who are good. Very black, and white. The characters, and their actions could have been more controversial. Bro! Anchan!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy it as much as I wanted. Not the worse. The shock value flash backs in it were indeed shocking. And it's just so interesting on how crazy the warden is. Aside from the good guys, it was ok.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nThis show is below most shounen. Even Naruto for a time went to a grey route, and showed that justice is in the eyes of the beholder. Good, and Evil all comes down to how the individual feels. Those shows, however, can get away with being bland, and preachy, because that's just how shounen animes are. Not to mention they're in a fantasy world where things run differently.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not 100% sure what Rainbow was going for, but if it was trying to give us a look on life back then, it didn't pick the right people.",

            "content": "I'll start saying that I chose this series as my personal project in my fansub group; each admin had its share and I picked up Rainbow. I had never saw anything about it neither read the manga, but the sinopsis and the promotional pic hooked me up immediately. The 2010 april season was full of \"pink\" anime and Rainbow looked like some serious \"blue\" matter; and since I'm a huge fan of shounen, I couldn't lose this opportunity to introduce some \"manliness\" into my team mates and followers.\r\nRight before start the translation process, I picked up the first three manga episodes and read them ina rush: I died! Not only the story was raw and cruel, the things that characters had to suffer touched my heart. There I remember I thought \"My gosh, I could have done a great choice this time\".\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nThe story's premise is simple: six teenagers, all of them involved in some criminal action (generally, because very good or desperate reasons), are imprisoned into Shounen Reformatory, a juvenile prison full of injustices and abuses. There, the self-centered boys meet their senpai, a guy older than them that has been imprisoned for a whole year by now. He teaches them a lesson since he considers them as \"a bunch of monkeys\", and then the kids fall in love with this guy. He becomes their light in that dark path, and even after they leave the facility he continues illuminating their lives. The story can be divided into two different arcs: the first 12 episodes inside the facility, and 14-26 which portrays their lives outside.\\n\\n\r\nWhat made this story so special to me was the rawness of the things they have to stand and the strenght every character depicts once they understand what camaraderie is truly about. Also, the feeling you have in some parts of the story is certainly creepy: when you start to think these kids can't be more disgraceful, something even worse happens to them. The reformatory's pests, the very nasty doctor Sasaki and his henchman the guard Ishihara, makes boys' lives a living hell; but they manage to survive to live after through the most important thing they learn in prison: the bond of friendship.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I disliked of this anime is the speed that sometimes risks to ruin it all. Some characters are not explored as much as others and you can get the feeling that they didn't have any development. Since they're quickly introduced to you, you can guess which kind of personality each one have. That could have been better, I like to discover characters while the story's going on. Some plots were easy to guess too, in counterpart to the well-planned others.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe animation is one of the best I've seen. The high contrast between the dark scenes in the reformatory and the \"pure air\" you can breath in the outside world really makes you feel the difference between one and another. The use of static scenes, with textured, alternative colours, was one of the big achievements, it gets you some strange feeling. You can think and consider the action scene you just seen with this \"stop\" pics.\\n\r\nThe character design is something I liked very much. They're not highly handsome boys, even girls are not exaggeratedly pretty and don't even mention villains, they're all quite disgusting, but that helped to keep the anime into a \"normal\" state of things. It helped me to keep the characters into a realistic view. The animation is sublime and goes very well with the design.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is an absolute. The BGM has to be one of the most accurated I've had the pleasure to listen. Every song has its moment and they transmit a very particular feeling. The voices are great. Every character has personality and mood swings, pretty real mood swings. The best work in my opinion goes for Rikiya Koyama, seiyuu for An-chan, and Shun Oguri as Mario.\\n\r\nThe opening is brutal, an awesome way to start every episode; the ending has been made to get you all cheesy, because when the episode ends, you want to cry just because of the song! \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nRokurota, or An-chan, is far away the best character of the whole bunch. A young, troubled man who has learnt to live looking forward, a character with a huge heart and street wisedom that fights every single day to find a bit of happiness in this dark world. He's pretty well developed and is easy to feel him as a natural leader while he guides the boys through that dark path.\\n\\n\r\nMario is a character that also developes himself very satisfactorily. He starts as the others, a punk with nothing to live for, but in the end you have realized, as you walk this difficult path beside him, that he's the most sweet, kind boy of all.\\n\\n\r\nNoboru (Turtle/Suppon) is a tiny thing, a very irritating kid that finds himself through hard lessons. Another success among the characters.\\n\\n\r\nRyuuji (Uncovered/Baremoto) is perhaps the most predictable of them. He's very selfish and greedy and makes a lot of mistakes during the series, but also has a good heart and it makes up for it.\\n\\n\r\nTadayoshi (Soldier/Heitai) was and is my personal favourite among the six boys, and I'm frankly disappointed because he didn't had his spot. His crime, life and personality are easy to guess, but I'd certainly liked to learn a little bit more from him.\\n\\n\r\nMansaku (Cabbage) is the classic friendly giant; I'm sure his crime was made because a very stupid mistake. He earns your heart with his calm mood and kindness.\\n\\n\r\nJyou (Joe) is the pretty boy. I was afraid to see him develop into some kind of predictable crybaby, but in the end proved to be the rudest of all and the most crazy kamikaze.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I was pretty satisfied with every character (even the supporting ones, they have crappy lives also), except the mentioned Soldier's abstinence. The northamericans portrayed in this series are kinda weird, a bit forced, but they fulfill their duty: as the \"enemies\", the boys learn to see them as persons as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI found myself enjoying every single episode. None of them left me with a disappointment feeling: in exchange, I died to see the next. I dropped tears of joy and sorrow with every trial the kids had to overcome, with every reunion, with every tragedy. Despite of the mentioned predictable plots, the resolution of each conflict touched my heart in a powerful, strong way. It moved me into tears more than once.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nThough I've written the few things I disliked, I can't give this series a lower rating. It just won a place in my heart in its entire form. I loved every single piece of it, even the mistakes or the predictable stuff, because the teaching it gives to you is so moving that I feel I didn't waste my time watching it: the lesson of friendship, the lesson of hope, all of that prepacked with an exciting old-school flavour and, more importantly, manly tears!!",

            "content": "''What is  life without happiness?'' -Rokurota Sakuragi\r\nRainbow is a story of friendship. How friendship can grow through hardship in an era  were everything was going wrong.  This is rainbow. A heartwarming,sad,  but at the same time an optimistic anime about life. Rainbow as a story was really good made and developed. Although at the time you are watching it you will say at specific times that the story can't go on, the anime continues in a magical way where the story won't get exaggerated or dull. Rainbow's story had only two flaws. First of all they should have one story atleast for Soldier as he was the only character that he didn't have his own story arc. Yet he was my favorite character. Also with the exception of Joe, Turtle and Sakuragi we didn't learn anyone else background story. And it was a pity really because it would be really interesting. But overall rainbow is an anime that displays friendship in a harsh time were a good friend was the most important thing in the world and it manages to display it really good.\\n\r\nIn the animation department I have to say one thing: Madhouse. So yeah enough said I believe.\\n\r\nThe sound was also amazing.  The opening was a song performed by Coldrain a famous Japanese rock band and it had a really deep meaning about the anime. The ending was performed by Galneryus one of my favorite Japanese bands and even though I don't like so much their ballads it was a heartwarming song that left you with a bittersweet feeling every time an episode ended.\\n\r\nAnd now for the characters. In one word they were amazing. From Mario and Joe to Cabbage and Soldier every person in this anime had their own problems and demons inside them. But no matter what they have to deal with, their friendship was the most important thing for them. You will see huge character development from the time that the kids are inside the prison but also the time after they came out of there. From he start until the end the anime was built solely on character development.\\n\r\nSo what is friendship? And how far would you go for your friend? This is the question that rainbow asks. This anime made me laugh, cry, love, hate and live through its characters. Sometimes it may drug it's story a lot but then it will regain your interest again with it's adorable characters. It's a unique anime way different from what we are used to. A must watch for me. Hope they would made more anime like this.",

            "content": "(SPOILERS AHEAD)\r\nPreliminary Note:\r\nA few things before I actually get into this review.\r\n1st. I actually got into this anime via Galneryus, one of my favorite J-Metal bands.\r\n2nd. This is based on the second time I watch this anime. When I originally saw this anime, I thought it was the best thing ever. However, I stopped watching it after Mario and Inc. got revenge because I felt like it ended there. Trust me, it did. Anyways, onto the actual review.\r\nThesis:\r\nRainbow is somewhat of an overrated AND underrated anime. The anime definitely evolved my taste in anime, but looking back on it, it's definitely not as good asI originally thought it was. Though having a few gems, I feel that the anime was incredibly weak in some spots.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5/10\\n\r\nIn short, the story is good after a certain point until they kill a character in which it goes down from then. SPOILERS ahead.\\n\\n\r\nThe 1st half of the anime had a pretty good story in my opinion. To keep things terse, 7 kids in a post-war detention center learn to get along so they can escape it. Their two main enemies are one of the prison guards, Ishihara, and the prison nurse/pedophile whose name I forgot.\\n\\n\r\n3 of them eventually make it out. However, the story reaches the climax when Sakuragi dies to Ishihara and the nurse. Sakuragi is sort of the \"big brother\" character to the rest of the 5 kids. After he dies, the rest of the 5 plan for revenge on the two, in which they get. If the anime ended there and right there, it would've been higher for the story.\\n\\n\r\nBut it didn't. The second half of the story switches from a story about breaking out of a detention facility and bromance into a sort of edgy slice of life... and bromance. It's cool and all, but it wasn't what I signed up for. I feel the story feel incredibly flat, and it was sort of hard to keep interest after a while.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6/10\\n\r\nThe art can be good in some parts, but I felt like the art overall was meh. I felt if it was much more animated than a few still frames in some places (such as the fire scene), it definitely would've been a bit more investing.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nGoing back to my prelim, the reason I watched this was for Galneryus. I also got some other magnificent gems such as Dear Night Rainbow. The music was definitely a plus.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10\\n\r\nThe only 7 characters with any actual depth into them are the 7 main characters. Ishihara and the nurse guy are just villains solely to be villains, and everyone else is just sort of stale in my opinion. And even then, the main characters can be stale at some parts.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5/10\\n\r\nDuring my second watch of this, it was sort of hard for me to accept it wasn't what I originally made it out to be- a masterpiece. Perhaps since I watched a whole bunch of other prestigious anime such as JoJo's and FMA:B, when I come back to this, it does give me nostalgia, but my improved tastes had made me more critical of it than I originally was.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score = 6/10 (+1 for Nostalgia)\\n\r\nIs it a good anime? No. Is it bad? No. It's flawed at some parts and shines at others, but it evens out to make it just an okay anime. If you're relatively new to anime (or I think you just have a shit taste), I might recommended this to you. It's better than most. However, if you have a developed taste in anime, I'd suggest giving this one a pass.",

            "content": "Rainbow Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin tells the story of seven young men who are sent to a juvie prison post-World War Two in Japan. They\u2019re all sent there for very different reasons, and have conflicting personalities, but not before long they become something like brothers. I would relate this anime to the American novel Holes (1998) by Louis Sachar turned movie (2003) starring Shia LaBeouf. The stories are a like in which a boy-- in Rainbow\u2019s case seven boys-- are sent to a juvenile detention facility to serve time for committing a crime. The major difference is that Rainbow is a much more mature storydealing with controversial and rather disturbing issues. It\u2019s Holes on crack dealing with murder, rape, pedophilia and some extreme teenage angst. \\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10\\n\r\nLike a lot of 26 episode anime, this story holds two arcs. The first arc is meeting the boys on their way to the juvenile hall, watching them become friends, and creating a plan for escape. The arc ends after a major character\u2019s death. The second arc focuses on the boys return to society after serving their sentences. The second arc isn\u2019t as emotional in some ways. Even the way the episodes are created feel different because there\u2019s a lot more comic relief, but even that is scarce, and some of the episodes aren\u2019t as gripping as the first arc episodes. In all honesty, some feel like filler material with nothing to really add to the main story. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9.5/10\\n\r\nSo the characters are brilliant because they\u2019re hopelessly flawed. We have some clich\u00e9s here with the likable protagonist who was jailed by a corrupted law, the so-cool-nobody-can-touch-him older brother figure An-chan (a nickname taken from the Japanese word Aniki meaning older brother in a gangster sort of way), the simpleton, the weakling, the tough guy, the snitch (who\u2019s also the glasses character), and the (sort of) comic relief. Together they make a perfect cast that keeps the story interesting. \\n\r\nOne thing about the \u201cbad guy\u201d characters is that you can immediately spot them because they\u2019re unpleasant to look at. It\u2019s like their appearance shows how rotten they are on the outside, and they make you cringe at the memory of them.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful in this. From the opening and ending song to everything in between. Rainbow was drawn in a less anime type style and more in a realistic way. Besides the extremely unattractive bad guy characters (some of which I thought resembled titans from Attack on the Titans more so than humans) , the character were so well animated they seemed like they were based off real people. \\n\\n\r\nMusic 10/10\\n\r\nOh, the music.  The beginning song is \"We're not alone\" by Japanese rock band coldrain. It\u2019s sung entirely with English lyrics and goes with the raw feeling and emotions in the show. The ending song \u201cA Far Off Distance\u201d, also by a Japanese rock band called Galneryus is a more mellow song which captures the melancholy feelings of the show. The background music of the show of course makes scenes more emotional and beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nI would not recommend this show if you do not like, or can\u2019t handle, depressing, unnerving, or all around disturbing things. It is a mature show much like Elfen Lied that deals with serious issues and the darkest of human flaws. \\n\\n\r\nHowever if you\u2019re curious, I highly recommend you watch this amazing story. You will not be disappointed. It available on the Funimation YouTube channel.\\n",

            "content": "Are you looking for an amazing anime? Then you're looking in the right place. I'm going to be reviewing Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin. Rainbow is an anime from Madhouse which aired in 2010.\r\nThe setting is set after World War II. Seven teenagers are sent to a reformatory  where they are confined. In this confined reformatory, these people are always treated horribly. But during these dark times, there is a small ray of hope. \r\nStory\r\nThe story is a really serious and mature story. Rainbow is a really depressing, tear-jerker story. Rainbow is a anime that teaches us about true brotherhood. This was such abeautiful story. Although there were a few unanswered questions. The unanswered questions doesn't really take away from the story though.\\n\r\n9/10 \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art was just beautiful. Madhouse did a great job presenting the sad and gloomy atmosphere. Especially when the narrator is narrating. The art during those scenes are just so beautiful. \\n\r\n10/10 \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was also just beautiful. The background music suited the anime quite well. A certain piece of the soundtrack that I just love is the opening, \"We're not alone\". The opening was just addicting and it fit the anime quite well with it's tone and lyrics\\n\r\n\"There's a place inside this world.. where hopes and dreams will not be lost\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThere was a diverse set of characters. They were each unique with their own separate personailities. They each got a backstory except for one of the characters. I had a lot of respect for these characters.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nAs soon as I started Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin, I knew I was going to love it. When I finished it, I just said to myself, \"This is it. The type of anime that I was looking for\". I haven't seen an anime as amazing as Rainbow and will definitely take my #1 spot for a really long time.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: 9.6/10\\n\\n\r\nRainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin had such a beautiful story with it's great set of characters, soundtrack and it's art.  \\n",

It tells a surprising gripping story that made me sit back and want to see more right away.  After only two episodes I want to know about what's happening.  For me that kind of story is rare in an anime these past few season.  If you watch one anime this season and you don't mind astory that's a little on the depressing side so far, than skipp all those Romance whatever animes and take a peak at this one.",

            "content": "\"Beautiful\". That is how one would describe both a seven-colored rainbow and the anime Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin. How corny was that opening? But, honestly, it is the only word that I can think of to describe this breathtaking show about the beauty of true and everlasting bonds of friendship even during the darkest of times. This show is about the way seven teenagers (the \"seven-colored Rainbow\") condemned to the living hell of Shio Reformatory can withstand and survive horrors and pain that were beyond my wildest imaginations. Madhouse (god do I love them) created a masterpiece with this one and it got meaddicted right from the start.\\n\\n\r\nBoth the story and characters are the main crux of the show, and they drive this emotional piece right through to the end and never let go of the viewer (no matter how hard we want to look away at times). And this is one dark and grim show. This is 10 years post-WWII Japan where the country is in shambles with starvation, crime and corruption rampant everywhere. The seven main boys are literally the lowest on the totem poll of society and are thrown into Shio to be used and almost disposed of, and the situations and events that are presented in this show represent those very thoughts. Rape, murder, betrayal, torture. You name it.\\n\\n\r\nThere were so many times that I wanted to just rage or was cringing during this show because of how unfair, despicable and disturbing things were at times. However, good things do eventually happen!! Rainbow gives us the light at the end of the tunnel at just the right times and the strength of the friendship and bond between the seven boys powers the viewer through all the despair. It connects us to the characters even more and you truly end up sympathizing and rooting for these guys throughout the show. It truly is awe-inspiring how the guys kept a positive outlook even in the worst of circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nRainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin is brutal to watch at times due to its highly graphic nature and mature themes, but the payoff in story and character development is unlike any other that I've seen in anime. More people need to see this show!! Madhouse created a masterpiece and if you have the stomach for it, I highly suggest that you watch this ASAP. It will not disappoint. Do it for An-chan.",

Out of the hundreds of reviews I've read, this is the first time I've felt compelled to write a reply from what I've seen. Most of you vaguely wrote of a story of 7 detained boys. One of you even insults the storyline saying there's no real character development or plot and it's just a cesspool of tragic pasts.\r\nWhat you, who have not experienced any suffering in your lives fail to realize; is that even as exaggerated as the plot seems to be... The unfortunate things the boys go throughand their relationships are not only tangible, but very real. It is because of their circumstances and the time period that they build a camaraderie that is not normally found between friends.\\n\\n\r\nAs sad and depressing as this show makes out to be, this is what appeals us to it. The reason why it's such an amazing work of art. The point that many of you are probably missing because you have not suffered to such an extent to feel empathy for what the characters have to go through.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, I'm not judging anyone's pasts. I'm simply stating an opinion from what I've read.",

            "content": "Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin, the first thought that occurred to me after watching the first few episodes were: \u2018why had I not watched this earlier?\u2019 This anime just exudes quality, whether in terms of story or the characters. There is an overarching theme of what friendship really is and what it means to form close bonds with people. It also takes quite a realistic approach to what life is really like, unlike the typical fluffy slice of life anime. Note that there are very minor spoilers in this review to explain better in what I am trying to get across.\r\nBacktracking a bit, the animeis split into two parts, first it takes place mainly in the Shonan Special reform school in the year 1995. Actually more than a reform school it feels more like a prison. This is especially emphasized by just all the \u2018grey\u2019 you see everywhere. And I don\u2019t just mean the colour in the literal sense. I mean also the whole vibe and atmosphere just feels so dark and lifeless. Not at all a good environment for the people that are spending part of their lives there. This may be mainly due to harsh conditions, such as being abused constantly with no luxuries, unless they are obtained in \u2018special\u2019 ways. There is also a lot of corruption going on under the covers.\\n\\n\r\nWe are introduced to seven main characters, in which they all have a very important role in the story. They are never really referred to their real names much and are called Mario, Cabbage, Soldier, Turtle, Uncovered, and Joe. The nicknames suit them very well, whether it may be because of their appearance, or the personality they come with. Each of them might share a few similarities, such as the reason why they ended up in the reform school in the first place, but their personalities are essentially very different. Then there is Rokurouta Sakuragi, referred to as \u2018aniki\u2019 by these young men. If I could describe him in one word, it would be \u2018charisma.\u2019 He looks and acts a lot more mature for his age. He is highly respected by the other six, though it might not have been like that in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the series shows more of their daily lives. Though the tones may feel a lot different to the first half, it is by no means \u2018bad\u2019, just different and quite necessary for the story. It reveals that life is not just sunshine and rainbows, and that not everything works out as the characters as well as we, want it all the time. A lot of the times a lot of time and effort is required to achieve your dreams.  There are the good moments, and the bad moments. There may be moments when the relationship between people may become stale, and they then have to work together to mend it. Real life events such as the after effects of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima are also integrated as part of the story, which is a nice touch and more relatable as well.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to point out the flaws of this anime, it would be the characters, in which is not a bad thing at all. This anime does not bother to beat around the bush and try to hide the fact that the characters are essentially flawed, whether it may be the things they did in the past or the very dumb mistakes some of them make even in the present time. I mean borrowing your friend\u2019s money and saying it was for textbooks and instead spending it on a prostitute cannot really be justified. Which is actually a great, refreshing approach and very much often a lot of anime would not dare to go into that kind of territory. Each of the characters are not just glossed over and idealized, they actually seem a lot like real people you would meet in real life. Whether they may be crude, rude or has had led a very messed up life, all of them have some sort of trouble they have had to, and still do need, to resolve. Each of the characters back story is revealed at different times in just the right moments, and does not feel forced at all. The anime excels at bringing out emotional moments that may be at times heart-warming, or just plain heart-wrenchingly painful.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and character designs are on point. The animation is fluid and has moments there are still frames that looks like a sketch. That may not be a good thing for some series, but for Rainbow it\u2019s a nice touch and the artwork suits the atmosphere of the series. Another thing to note is the amount of narration that accompanies this series. Though the series could stand by itself without it, it explains and makes things a bit clearer to get the full effect of the events that occur. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the ost, though it may not be the best I\u2019ve heard, it does its job. The one thing that did stand out the most though was the opening theme. \u2018We are not alone\u2019 by Coldrain, an \u2018Engrish\u2019 song with lyrics and sound that was extremely impactful and memorable. Probably went down as one of my top opening themes of all time. \u2018If there's a place inside this world,  Where hopes and dreams are not yet lost, We'll stand and fight against these walls, We'll fight this fight forevermore\u2019,  these lyrics are so suitable to the anime, and it sounds great too.\\n\\n\r\nWell to sum up this review, overall I felt it was great, it succeeded in bringing the right emotions out of me, it felt sad when it was supposed to feel sad and happy in the light hearted moments. \\n",

            "content": "Rainbow Nisha Rokubou No Shichinin is in my opinion a breath-taking series.\r\nStory: For me theres two parts of the story the one where they try to survive in jail, guarded by a cowardly, awful guy with nothing but bromance to keep them going and the second half where they meet new challenges in life not particular int the same environment. The first half was amazing how they all try to stick together and in the world of the cruel having friends is a basic need otherwise what else can keep you going in that terrible jail cell. Though some parts can be cliche and haveyou going like seriously? it really teaches you how important friends are , how you depend on one another and how big of a need your sense of belonging is.\\n\r\nThe second half is pretty much still about bromance though with them finding their dreams & goals also romance can come in between the way of friendship but in the bromance takes all. Rainbow had me crying on the second episode and to me was waay more meaningful then something like Clannad or Anohana though of course its just my humble opinion feel free to disagree.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I think the characters are the main reason i loved Rainbow in fact the characters are so important that they make up the story. Its all about how one interacts what they do and how they keep their brotherly bond together through the harsh environment. An-chan is the brother of the group like the alpha dog in a pack though of course they all are equal to one another. An-chan is the person who teaches them to not give up and to be strong. Mario and them of course helps and teach An-chan new things like friendship and love er in sorta homosexual way i guess but i just use the word bromance lol i really like that word. Each of the seven guys are very different and have different situations. One is smart, one is tall and strong, one is very kind, one is very small yet has a very big ego, one is the one who keeps the group together. Its so interesting seeing how all the different personalities work so well with each other.\\n\\n\r\nArt : The art for me is very good, the one can be dull sometimes which matches perfectly with the dark, miserable , sad theme. The eyes aren't  ridiculously huge and legs aren't tremendously long. The author does a very good job on drawing people that match with the personalities. Like if a person is very perverted & barbarous then they will look just like their personality\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: I really liked the ost though sometimes you wonder where this sudden loud metal music came from without warning. The lyrics match the story very well. The themes are very sad and can express all the hardships these seven guys have gone through and easily sets the mood and atmosphere. It also shows a kind of determination and passion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: i really enjoyed the series it kept me going one more episode, one more episode every night wanting them to get out of jail already and makes you wonder what would they do if they did. The characters backgrounds are very sad it makes you empathize and understand the characters more. Like i said before this series had me sobbing on the second episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I don't think I'll find a series very soon that gets me hooked right on episode one and has me sobbing so soon in the series mind that i've only cried for one other series in 50. Im warning you though there are some scenes that make me wanna gag also if you don't like anything sad, or if looking for comedy this series is not for you though give it a try you never know.",

            "content": "HUGE SPOILERS,this review is only for those who watched the series.\r\nIn an era where anime is plagued by overused cliches and themes like overpowered teenagers,cute girls,bouncing boobs ,came an anime series that was different and for that reason anime fans praised it and rushed to score it 10/10 while ignoring its considerable flaws ,set in post WW2 japan (how many animes are set in that time period ,not so many)This anime had the potential to be one of the best anime of all time but sadly it was a mediocre show and here is why:\r\n-too many plot-holes that went unexplained like why \"An chan\" isin the jail since he didn't kill his father, what's the big deal about the paper that had written by sakuragi's cellmate (this paper isn't an objective avidence that condemn sasaki and ichihara)even the dumb sakuragi  told them that he had a proof for their crimes(i mean it would be smarter for him to shut up and wait until his sentence ended then he could unmask their crimes when he is free) why these two act like there is no other authority in the prison, where was the chief warden when they were about to freeze three prisoners to death,and how they got away with killing another officer and burning half of the prison.\\n\r\nThis show is full with these questions that never answered, also the show depends heavily on victimizing it's characters to draw audience's sympathy,from the first five minutes you will see them  beaten,stripped and had a rectal examination by an old creepy geezer.\\n\r\n- now for the cringiest part of the show,the characters ,oh my god!\\n\r\nTheir behaviour during some of the most important plotpoint  made me want to smash my computer's screen for example how dumb was sakuragi when he lowered his guard during his encounter with ichihara and let himself  stabbed,or when Mario apologized for those assholes to only got his hand smashed by a rock or when he left ichihara instead of killing him for what he did ,and why sakuragi beat  his  other cellmate during their first day then shared a cigar with them,I mean what did  he want by this? Did he want to show them who is the boss ?did he want to show him them how much merciful he is? You have to choose what you want dude,and the list go on and on .\\n\r\nThe first part was much more focused while the second part became a loosely connected stories about the main characters (they even forgot to give hetai his own story)\\n\r\nThis anime has soooo many flaws and far from perfect but it was something different  i will be generous and gave it 6/10 ,it isn't the anime version of the shawshank redemption. No way.",

            "content": "The reviews for this show praise it MASSIVELY, and from reading them you would think this anime is a message from the messiah or something. Well, the best advice I have for you is don't get as overhyped as I did, because it might ruin your enjoyment of the show. Rainbow was meant to be underrated, something that you go into with no expectations and are shocked by. Without this factor, it falters a little. Nonetheless, Rainbow is still very good and deserves a portion of the praise.\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\r\nSTORY: 8/10\r\nThe concept of Rainbow is a rare one. It is one of the five anime at thisdate involving a life inside prison. I don't understand why more anime haven't used this, actually. It's a concept that can range from dark and brutal to just plain depressing. And of course, as we know from all shonen ever, anime fans love the 'fight for my friends!' thing. Though, Rainbow is nowhere near a shonen. It truly shows how people so unalike can bond together when put in the same predicament, and is in no way cliche. Episodes 1-14 of Rainbow were easily a masterpiece. And if they had ended it there, I would say it lived up to the hype! But... it doesn't. Instead it falls into this weird epilogue sort of thing that just seems unnecessary and it feels like they just wanted to fit it into the mid 20s length of episodes, just so it didn't stand out. It drags on too much and in the end, had a worse ending than the climax of episodes 1-14! It could have been better, but it wasn't completely terrible.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Rainbow is done by Madhouse. I could end the section with that sentence, but something is telling me I need to go more in depth. Both the animation and the art style are very good, and they peak at some points, but also have their lows too. Gore scenes, in particular, look fantastic, however sometimes character movement is unnatural, which I picked up even without carefully analyzing. The art style to it doesn't really have anything to complain about, but nothing to praise either. At times it can be extremely detailed with lining, but other times it leaves a feeling that they could have done more. Still overall, it looks very nice and was a great addition to the dark atmosphere.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n\"RRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW\\n\\n\r\nSUNLIGHT, WAS THE ONLY THING THAT SEEMED RIGHT\\n\\n\r\nBEFORE I CAME HERE\"\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme to Rainbow is probably the best I've ever seen. It's intense, brutal, and sets the tone of the show PERFECTLY. The ending though skippable, is nowhere near bad. The voice acting and sound effects are good as well, and set the mood for 1955 style action. So what brings down the score from a 9 or 10? The actual soundtrack of Rainbow, despite being classic and flashy, is repetitive, and can get REALLY annoying at some points, because it feels like the same scene is being repeated over and over again. \\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is simply the best created cast of characters I've seen in my entire career as an anime fan. Why? Because they're SO REAL! All of the main characters I feel represent the group of friends I had as a middle/high school student. The way they interact and talk with each other is great and they truly seem like a group of boys that grew up together as brothers. On top of that, they're some of the best developed out there. The supporting characters that are also part of the family also have their own realism to them, which makes the main characters shine even more. And the villains... oh my lord, the villains make you want to slaughter them SO BADLY! Again, you ask yourself: Only an 8? With that kind of praise? Yes, and the reason for that is the plainness of the antagonists in the second half. The characters that made the show so much better are removed, and they're replaced by.... well, templates of your typical villain that gets defeated in one hit. Honestly, if the antagonists hadn't been replaced, the second half would have been twice as good.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8.0/10\\n\\n\r\nSo the secret is out: Rainbow isn't perfect. Still, it's one of the better anime out there and definitely deserves more popularity, if not an entire fanbase dedicated to it. Though it can get straight up disturbing at some points, it is a mature story and a good one at that.",

Really nothing to bitch about, i didn't notice any flaws.

            "content": "Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue\r\nAnd the dreams that you dare to dream,\r\nReally do come true.\r\nSo for me personally, I was hesitant to check this show out because it was called rainbow and the synopsis was about the lives of 7 guys together. Being a heterosexual male, it is justified that I was hesitant because overdose of bromance can really make me feel uncomfortable. But the overall theme of friendship never dies is something that I can relate with and I thought to myself \"f-ck it.\"\r\nThe story starts out strong with the introduction of our characters and getting right into how these prison menare abused and looked down upon. Note that this is a historical show, meaning we are given the time period of the setting and things are handled in a way that relates to that time period. The story is really done well in the first half, we are shown explicit and mature content such as how people treated each other in prison and how abuse from the higher status is very corrupt. Preferably do not go into the show thinking its all blood and violence, but it brings out some really realistic themes that our characters had to use to keep on living. That helped drive the development of some characters and the show itself was really rich with ideas and made it very enjoyable to watch.\\n\r\n   I had problems with the second half of the show though, because there does not seem to be an overlying goal that needed to be reached. The first half did well because all the main characters are have a set goal and we get to see the process of achieving that goal while breaking barriers to do so. 2nd half seemed to bounce around a lot and I started to lose sympathy with some characters because interactions were force fed. The story really shined with the handling of the contemporary issues that were brought up. From things like rape, violence, corruption, to poverty and oppression; these things were handled with care and had me at the edge of my seat anticipating the resolution of these issues. Rainbow did a great job with the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe show right from the get go, introduces us to a boatload of characters, the 7 prison boys, the 2 one dimensional antagonists, and others that affect our main characters psychologically. There is Sakuragi, who everyone looks up to like a fatherly figure. He's already been in the prison for a year when our other protagonists arrive, making him the most experienced and his personality is developed through what he went through. I thought his change of personality after meeting our other 6 characters was forced and throughout the show felt like a plot device. Mentioning him was enough to drive the characters and it didn't seem like there was too good of a reason for it to be like that except for Mario. Moving on to Mario, he feels like a replica because he gets meaning in his life for watching his friends succeed. We only get to see him develop in the latter half of the show and it still felt like he wasn't important. \\n\r\nAs for Soldier and Cabbage - underdeveloped and only pushed the plot. Not that it was a bad thing but they are those strong willed people that is always nice to have your back. Couldn't get attached to them because of how little development they got. As for Uncovered, Joe, and turtle, these guys feel like the main lead of the show. We get to see these 3 go through some really, and i mean REALLY, f-cked up stuff in their past and its no wonder they act the way they do. But it's really good when they have to battle their own desires in order to save a friend fighting their own struggle with their past. These 3 I felt lead the show and gave me a fresh insight into how young adults can handle their distress. As for these characters as a whole, the theme of friendship is handled beautifully. The antagonists like I mentioned were 1 dimensional, their corrupted, and they wanna abuse guys because their messed up. As for side characters, Lily was decently developed and was a really likable character. Her role was very appropriate, being that at this time, Americans oppressed the Japs and she brought that theme to the table. As for Setsuko, meh. She was just apart of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nSound - a great opening. Song fits perfectly and animation for it was good; didnt skip it once. ED is pretty good too. The soundtrack sounded contemporary, but it was really excellent. Those scenes that had me at the edge of my seat? The music almost made me fall out of it because it really brought out the tension and the mood of each scene. As you should know by now, this is an explicit show and the music really does fit well with whatever f'd up thing is going on. Some tracks really brought out the emotion of certain scenes, and it will resonate with you as you watch and listen. A+ soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is realistic, these guys actually look like human beings. The gore is very graphic so if you have a weak stomach, I recommend not eating while you watch the show. Very detailed cuts and good scenery. \\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict: a really enjoyable show for those who can handle all the mature content thrown at you. The show is like a documentary but not boring. The 2nd half of the show may bore you if you enjoyed the first half because it isn't as goal oriented, but it does have really strong tension. Some characters could have been better characterized and developed, but with the big cast, its understandable if they couldn't flesh everything out. They all contributed to the telling of a great story. If you are reading this prior to watching it, get your emotions prepared, they will go on a rollercoaster.\\n",

            "content": "Bromance~!!\r\nRainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin is a dark, dramatic, thriller of an adventure set in a post WWII setting. It focuses on seven troubled adolescent boys through their emotionally, melodramatic journey, together through corruption, violence, injustice, malice, dream-chasing and friendship in search for the ray of light that is freedom and happiness.\r\nRainbow is what I call a \u201cHardcore\u201d Anime, and what I mean by that is, that it is not one of those Animes you watch for its escapism or happy entertainment value, its one of those Animes with serious themes and really makes you contemplate and ponder about the brutal realities in life. Rainbowis categorised in the Seinen genre as it does unquestionably appeal to a mature male demographic because of the grim, dark and rebellious undertone throughout the series, so be warned about its explicit imagery (You have been warned!!! >.>) and scenes which may well be disturbing for some people, although in my opinion it is put to good use, giving an intensely dramatic atmosphere and highlights successfully its thematic intentions (Even if sitting through it seemed like torture -_-). \\n\\n\r\nI would say Rainbow is one of those underrated Anime, people tend to prejudge and overlook because of its murkiness and bold, old fashioned art style but hey lets face it, the majority of people are going to divert their attention to something more attractive in their eye line and that goes for most things in life unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nRainbow has a very character focused plot and much of the series is more about the journey the characters undergo; we are taken in by each and every one of the boys hardships and pasts to what eventually led them to end up in that cell 2-6 with \u2018An-chan\u2019. Each part of the gang has his own unique personality and traits; An-chan the leader, mature, older than his age persona, Mario with the fighting spirit and never back down attitude, Spoon with the na\u00efve, likeable larger than live character, Soldier with the serious, hard, unbreakable personality, Cabbage with the gullible and loveable nature, Barimoto the clever fella with the plans and Joe the emotional boy who overcomes his fragility. Each and every one of the gang has a rightful place, and their differences in persona makes them ever more closer. Although I do think the characters are quite likeable to some extent, the characters sometimes seem to have a \u2018pantomimey\u2019 (if there is such a word) effect going on both in physical appearance and actions, as in the \u2018bad guys\u2019 seem a bit over the top, farcical-esque (Intensely Irritating Ishihara and Dr. \u2018Old Wrinkly Pedofile\u2019 Sasaki ^^) the \u2018good guys\u2019 seem occasionally like one dimensional, untainted angels who can do no wrong, this I find particularly cringey at best (Maybe its just me?) and did unsettle me at times. \\n\\n\r\nSome elements I particularly liked about this Anime such as the calm demeanour of the narration within the Anime, I felt, added to an effectively compelling atmosphere they were trying to depict and the range of colours and props used throughout the Anime also contributed to an already fixed tonal nature and represents its time period commendably.\\n\r\nTo be honest Rainbow won\u2019t be everyone\u2019s cup of tea that\u2019s for sure, as it does centre through gloomy themes and some episodes will seem like such a chore to muster (Did for me).\\n\\n\r\nThe message that Rainbow showed me is that even in an ugly world full of life and death situations there can be hope in courage, dreams and most importantly friendship if not fraught with sacrifice but in determination, persistence and trust we can find freedom and happiness even in the darkest journey for justice. If you are in search for a well paced, different-from-your-conventional-Anime, dark, deep and emotionally character driven Anime that will make you think for a long time and be ingrained in your memory in both good and bad ways, this should be at the very top of your \u2018Plan to watch list\u2019.\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW HAS NO SPOILERS\r\nFirst of all, my english is a bit rusty, so please, if you see some grammar errors, just ignore it.\r\nThis Review will contain great historical content, so I can make a proper analysis about this anime.\r\nStory (10/10):\r\nAhhh World War II... when millions of people lost their lives, their families, their homes... everything because of the selfish actions and decisions of some psychopaths that had political power. And this applies specially to the Soviet Union, Germany and Japan, but most specifically Japan.\r\nBack in the 1930's, after the Japanese invasion of Manchuria (1931) and the \"Rape of Nanking\" in the Second Sino-Japanese War(1937-1945), the Imperial Japanese Army was well known for it's great cruelty and brutality towards enemy soldiers, prisioners of war and civilians.\\n\\n\r\nIn 1941, Japan attacked the North-American base on Pearl Harbor, forcing USA to declare war on them. Well, it was a bloddy and dark jorney of brutal battles until 1945. Japan was clearly losing the war against the Allied Forces, but refused to surrender. Many air raids were made by the Allied Forces, aiming droping incendiary bombs in regions were civilians houses were made of wood.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the allied air forces did many reconnaissance missions in the main Japan islands, they saw civilians being trained with bamboo spears and suicidal tatics with explosives. They came to the conclusion that an ground invasion was to risky and would cost way to many lives. \\n\\n\r\nThey decided to test the atomic bomb they were developing in Japan, so they can test the destruction power of it and show a great demonstration of power, forcing then to surrender. \\n\\n\r\nAugust 6, 1945. The B-29 plane named \"Enola Gay\" drops the first atomic, the \"Little Boy\" bomb on Hiroshima, killing more than 100.000 people and reducing the entire city to rubble. 3 days later, they droped the second atomic bomb \"Fat Man\" on Nagasaki. In September 2, Japan officialy surrendered. World War II was oficially over.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want more information about this historical event and it's victims, i recomend this documentary: http://www.fallen.io/ww2/\\n\\n\r\nNOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT \"RAINBOW: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin\"!!\\n\\n\r\nWell, the history begins exactly 10 years after the end of the war, in 1955.\\n\r\nSix teenagers were arrested for the comiting various crimes, each of them being explained later.\\n\\n\r\nWhat matters here is: although the story begins 10 years after the end of the war, it's very clear how the japanese society, as a whole, struggled to came out of the misery and tried to redeem for their past mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not trying to discuss if events like the Hiroshima/Nagasaki bombings were right or wrong. The point is, it's really fair that a whole mass of inocent civilians, some of witch didn't even agree with the war, had to suffer so much because of the actions of some psychopath's soldiers, military commanders and politicians? \\n\\n\r\nRainbow brings up that simple question. How the children suffered with all this. How their families starved, how the lives of their relatives were cut short by the war, how they had to do extreme things to survive. And no, i'm not saying Japan is a victim. Like I said before, we don't forget the cruelty and brutality their soldiers showed to nations they invaded. \\n\\n\r\nBut in war, there's no such thing as a winner. Everybody that takes part in it loses something. And the suffering of the japanese population during and after the war, like many others in the entire world, it's a historical fact.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to Rainbow, the most beautiful thing about this whole story is how this six teenagers grow up together in prison, how they become real brothers and how they struggle together to overcome the hardships of life.\\n\\n\r\nThe friendship is a simple thing, but one of the strongest relations humans can make. And, unfortunately, not everybody got to fell the wonderfull experience that is to have someone you can really call a brother.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the story develops, tha cruelty in the prison, the social discrimination, the dificulty of the teenagers that lost all and tries to adapt into society and persue their personal dreams is simply a masterpiece. Truly a wonderfull massage.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation was made by Studio Madhouse, and it is very well done. The visuals are stunning sometimes, and the art can express the dark moments and the  happy ones in very good way.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe music it's very good, but it's not the strongest point in the series. It's very fitting and imersive, but also kind of repetitive. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP, in my opinion, it's great. The english lyrics fits perfectly in the story, and the metal rifs helps to add the \"harsh times\" felling.\\n\r\nThe Ending, however, it's no big deal. \\n\\n\r\nCaracter (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nWalking along side the great story, the caracter development are a very strong point. I can say much, because if a I do, I'll give major spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I can say is that not every caracther has a great developmente in the story, and that's because the anime didn't adapted the whole manga series. Still, it's a great feature in the animation.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThat's way to personal. If you enjoy watching a series with a great dramatic background, historical content, realistic caracters, a very good animation and a great philosophical story, you will certainly enjoy Rainbow.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nWell, I've said too much about this series, but it's certainly one of the best anime i've ever watched. I would recomend this to anyone tha likes the kind of content that i've listed below. So, if you read this to the end, thank you for your time and give \"Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin\" a try!! \\n\\n\r\n\"If there's a place inside this world\\n\r\nwhere we must go back to once more,\\n\r\nuntil the day,\\n\r\nwe find that place,\\n\r\nWe're not alone.\"\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review contains no spoilers.\r\nRainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin is a dark, disturbing, yet uplifting and inspiring story. This story is set in a post-WW2 Japan. This state of the 1950's Japan is heavily present in the story, as well as the effects of the war on various character's lives. The story follows 7 boys who must survive the harsh conditions of a juvenile reform school, one that acts much like a prison.\r\nWarning: This is a mature story. It contains scenes of graphic violence, sexual abuse, drug use, etc.\r\nThis story shows the perserverance of these boys, as they use their own strengths and trust ineach other to survive the physical abuse and corrupt situation of Shounan Special Reform School. Even if they do ever make it out of this hell, what happiness can exist in the lives of these juveniles?\\n\\n\r\nIf anyone is looking for a story and characters that feel real, Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin is for you. This anime is truly great in story, characters, and the impact it leaves in you. Particularly, I found the characters in this anime to be exceptional. The characters feel like real people: they are multi-faceted, each has their own personality, each have flaws, and they all develop over time. Each character has their own story, and how they ended up in a reform school. Almost all of the main characters have a compelling character arc(s) that is explored throughout the story. There are many great secondary characters as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnother highlight was the use of narration. This anime uses narration in various parts of the story to explain the meaning behind the events. The substance of the narration is great, and the way the scenes are presented artistically is quite beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nI will say, this story feels so complete and wraps up perfectly. Even some of the best anime can't seem to have a proper ending. This one does, and a beautiful one at that. Like any story, it isnt without its flaws, but the flaws and criticisms I have are extremely minimal in Rainbow.\\n\\n\r\nI'll add some more things that might deter some people. Once again, this is a dark story. There were several scenes that were difficult to get through. However, this is a realistic story of a prison-like environment. If they were to remove these scenes and pretend they don't happen in real life, historically, and still to this day, then this story would lose its realism. If you don't want to see graphic and disturbing content, do not watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being an incredibly dark and violent series, this story is truly inspiring. The themes of courage and the pursuit of happiness, and the powerful friendships that are made, tested, and maintained. This story will hit you with the cold, harsh reality of what life can be, but will also hit you with the warm, loving reality of what life can be. These friends make a promise to meet again on the outside, after finishing their sentences, and achieve a better life.\\n\\n\r\n\"A life without happiness is a terrible thing\"",

But what a mistake I made.\r\nRainbow was truly a breathtaking anime. Every minute of it keeps you desiring more, it truly allows the viewers to put themselves in the shoes of the characters and understand the pain they must have gone through\r\nthe sad part is this story might very well have a lot of truth in it,with the history in Japan after the world war.\r\nI won't lie, a lot of themes in it are heavy,child abuse and rape. Molestation, pedophilia, violence, blood, you name it\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonists may seriously make you want to hit the screen. Its sad how evil and cruel people can be. To this day i'm still not sure who was the most terrible.\\n\\n\r\nBut don't let that discourage you. Don't turn your eyes away from something real and true.\\n\\n\r\nThe bonds between the characters are what moved the story. The situations they were put in was what made them who they are\\n\\n\r\nAn-chan (Sakuragi) the leader, was such an amazing role model i may never forget the eyes of that warrior\\n\\n\r\nAnd Mario eventually becomes a worthy successor to him\\n\\n\r\nVery sad, very meaningful story, worthy of being watched by all, be they male or female.",

            "content": "\u201cI wonder\u2026what they are doing right now. There were seven men who survived rather grand days at the bottom of the cauldron of hell, inside a cell, fifty years ago.\r\nOne of the things that never fail to leave an impression on one\u2019s heart is the term \u201cfriends\u201d and how they are connected together. There will always be people in one\u2019s life who are part of that person\u2019s existence, and their very will to live. Rainbow, as an anime expresses this basic human relation in one of the most beautiful, yet realistic ways possible.\r\nImmediately after World War II, Japan was in chaos and no order existedwhatsoever. In a country as badly affected as Japan, which was still a developing country around that time, it was quite difficult on certain populations, those being mainly children, teenagers, young adults, women and the old \u2013 and it is not that difficult to understand why; with schools, many private enterprises and so many other things shut down, the population was in chaos. And to keep the teenagers and young adults from going rowdy and initiating hooliganism, many \u201cdisciplinary schools\u201d where established, who on the surface \u201cre-educated\u201d the children while really brutalizing, exploiting, and molesting them.\\n\\n\r\nRainbow walks us into the lives of seven young boys who were in one of such schools. What sets this anime apart from many of your run-of-the-mill slice-of-life anime is the unique way the story unfolds, the emotions laid bare, the unbreakable ties, and the pain these boys have to suffer. Once again a superb work from MadHouse, this anime is considered a masterpiece by most. One has only to watch the first minute to get hooked. \u201cThe things that supported them were courage, guts and their bond. They placed their hopes on the seven colored rainbow, and swore to survive. And you know there\u2019s no stopping this anime\u2019s completion. A must-watch for anyone, be he an anime-enthusiast on not. This anime scores a full 10/10 in my books.\\n\\n\r\nNot only is the story exceedingly compelling, but other factors, like sounds, dialogues, animation are truly moving. Enough with the incessant praise; Even if it\u2019s not a recent release, the anime has a unique artwork. It is lucid. It almost feels like watercolor work. When you look at the animation, you can\u2019t help but feel a certain aesthetic pleasure. Being an aesthetic myself, I find the animation overwhelmingly good, and one of this anime\u2019s may fortes.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds are another forte. Simply because the music is done with a guitar and it is enticing, going smoothly with the anime and complementing it in every step; something that steps up the anime\u2019s quality up a notch.\\n\\n\r\nYou can\u2019t make out the words anymore.\\n\\n\r\nSeven prison inmates who try to survive by depending on each other. A story about friendship. One of the key things it will need is character development. Rainbow does it beautifully; you can feel the frustration from Mario, the pain from Aniki, the desperation from the others everything etched out and laid bare. The only thing frustrating was one of the things that Sakuragi does. It is however made up for appropriately.\\n\\n\r\nNot really another forte, but the dialogue really gets you through. There isn\u2019t much to say about the dialogue. Just that they are decent.\\n\r\nThis anime reigns 5th in my top 10 list. The enjoyment of watching it was profound. If there is any story that portrays friendship, hope, humanity and trust, few do it as beautifully as Rainbow. I recommend it highly. Watch it. Enjoy it. Love it.\\n\\n\r\nBut the dreams they held were undoubtedly carved on this tree.\\n",

Do not judge the book by its cover, otherwise you will be losing a great content it contains. He speaks very well about what is friendship ?, far would you go to help a friend, even being willing to sacrifice even his life for having done it a dream? It's amazing how speaking fellowship of the seven boys and how one word can change your life in the midst of indecision, which ends up becoming a teaching. \r\nRecommend to anyone who wants to watch a great anime and that is differentand realistic, because it is not only a friendship, but the violence, wars, pedophilia and sexual abuse, abuse of power that these young men spent supporting each other, summarizing Rainbow is a lesson of life, especially for those who say that their lives are a waste.",

And it did pay off.\r\nWhat i disliked about this anime:\r\n-One dimensional characters.\r\n-Lack of enjoyment (the story is too heavy, has almost no comedy in it).\r\nWhat i liked about this anime:\r\n-Totally memorable story.\r\n-Nice character story development.\r\n-Freaking COOL opening theme, only skipped it like 3 times.\r\nStory 9/10: \r\nIt starts in a very rough and unstable way, for the first 7 chapters; it can be a bit annoying in this part, but after this you can start to catch up to thepacing. That is when most of the great story elements come to light. Story development after episode 7 and the character arcs were very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\r\nThe drawing and animation was very good and unique, they fitted the story and characters neatly; especially when it portrays the bad guys crazy looks, that was a very memorable detail.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10:\\n\r\n- Opening: COOOOOL, this song blowed me away from the first time i heard it, and it fits the story greatly. \\n\r\n- Ending: Fine, i almost always skipped it.\\n\r\n- Voices: Great, good voice acting, and even English voice acting was featured.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter  6/10: \\n\r\nThis is the biggest weakpoint in this anime, i felt like one of the characters didn't do anything for the entire series, and the characters were \"too good\" or \"too bad\", to the point that they didn't react realistically, they felt too forced for the most part of the story, but that is probably the main point of this anime, to show how these one dimensional characters grow through the episodes, and learn from their mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10: \\n\r\n-Story Enjoyment: After chapter 7 it was a great time watching this anime, and even the first episodes actually make this whole anime unique and memorable, even if i didn't love it.\\n\r\n-\"Fun\" Element: Very little; the story develops in a way that can often make you cry or feel anger if you are a sensitive person, or even smile, but laughing is not so easy while watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10:\\n\r\nI think this is a story worth looking at, it will teach you some lessons if you didn't learn them from shonen animes, and is ultimately a unique experience.\\n\\n\r\nFirst review ever =)\\n",

The story is very unique, i never saw an anime on a reform school. The tale was continuous with little gaps.\r\nIn the anime we have seven main characters, with different personality. In the first episode we learn why they are in the reform school, but in the following epsiodes we will know the real reasons behind their sins...\r\nThe art isoverall great, but not special at all. It was like realistic (No big eye or loli). I personally loved the drawings in the end of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuus voice fitted well for the characters. Especially Kanjiya Shihori, who did a great job with Setsuko's voice. The opening is one of my all time favourites, they have done a really good job with that, it fitted very well in the atmosphere of the anime, with that rock\\punk style.

            "content": "First of all, I'm not going to do this review like I've done the other. I won't say why I think this or that is 10/10. Just read.\r\nYou find yourself stuck in the middle of the darkness. First, you think your eyes are closed, and that\u2019s why you can\u2019t see nothing. Then you realize they are opened, and that you can really see nothing. Only dark. Only fear. Fear of being alone for the rest of your life. Fear of being useless. \r\nAfter that moment of darkness, life goes on and you start to do things you actually shouldn\u2019t do. These are the 1955\u2019s, andwhat\u2019s wrong is immediately punished. You are sent to a reformatory, with another 5 people. There, you go to the compartment 2, cell 6. You and the others find a guy. He\u2019s gonna be your room mate. \\n\r\n(...)\\n\r\nMonths passed , and you seven are now best friends. You can\u2019t imagine your life without each other. You keeping thinking about being outside, the seven of you together, in freedom... It sounds so good.\\n\r\nOn that reformatory, you\u2019ve learned so many things. Crazy people from there taught you a lot...\\n\r\n(...)\\n\r\nThat\u2019s how Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin is. It just teaches you things. It teaches you how to identify your true friends. Because, i must say, that this anime is about true friendship. I cried rivers and rivers watching it. In. Every. Single. Episode.\\n\r\nThe ending was good, but I think that something is missing. I know what that something is, but I won\u2019t say because I don\u2019t wanna spoil it.\\n\r\nNisha Rokubou is a masterpiece that shows you, that even when you\u2019re in the dark, even you think you\u2019re worthless, useless, a piece of crap, a nothing, YOU\u2019RE WRONG. You\u2019re worth. You\u2019re useful. You\u2019re a piece that the world need. You\u2019re everything. Life is bad at many different ways, but, even if it looks like you don\u2019t have friends, at all, you do. Even if it\u2019s just one. A true friend isn\u2019t something you can just have. It\u2019s difficult to have one. Watching the anime, I realized I actually just have one true friend. And that\u2019s sad you know, I really thought I had more... But whatever, PLEASE watch Rainbow. You are going to love it. Everything it\u2019s perfect on that anime. If you don\u2019t like violence scenes, don\u2019t watch it. It\u2019s full of it.\\n\r\nThe anime provides you a magnificent story, with beautiful characters, beautiful OST, and i absolutely enjoyed watching it. \\n\r\nThis anime it\u2019s not just one anime... It is THE anime.",

            "content": "WARNING: SOME SPOILERS DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW SOME STUFF\r\nI don't write many reviews but i feel as though this one should be reviewed, the pacing of the show is weird from episode 1-13 it's about prison life and breaking out, honestly the show could have ended here but for some reason it decided to keep going, from there we see 2 episodes each dedicated every character and while this isn't a bad thing it leaves some character's out in the dust.\r\nSakuragi, Rokurouta (Bro)\r\nIll start with bro, from episode 1-13 he get's all the light, there is hardly any development forthe other characters, infact the whole time they praise bro and deal with hardships in his name, i'v never seen any other character get praised as much as this guy in the show, it is true that this character is very likeable but i think in prison they should have fleshed out the other characters more instead of focusing on just this one.\\n\\n\r\nMinakami, Mario (Mario)\\n\r\nMario is the main character after the \"Bro arc\" the focus is mostly on him and at this point they mostly focus on him throughout the rest of the show, he's basically \"Bro\" so there's really not much to talk about here, what i wrote about bro applies to this character but he doesn't take all of the light 100% of the time.\\n\\n\r\nYokosuka, Jou (Joe)\\n\r\nJoe's story arc was actually interesting but cut very short, his backstory is the typical \"Orphan\" backstory but with a twist i didn't expect, infact i loved the twist it really made his backstory way different from other anime characters, although not original 100% it does add some depth to his personality, but sadly his story was cut short too soon.\\n\\n\r\nMaeda, Noboru (Turtle)\\n\r\nTurtles story was okay, nothing special at all really i don't really have anything to talk about for him.\\n\\n\r\nNomoto, Ryuuji (Uncovered)\\n\r\nThis character is the biggest fuck up of the bunch, his story arc's aren't particularly interesting and (KINDA LARGE SPOILER AHEAD) he is seen time and time again as a backstabber, think of a meth addict who fuck's up everything, basically this uninteresting character \\n\\n\r\nMatsuura, Mansaku (Cabbage)\\n\r\nAh what can i say about Cabbage besides getting the worst end of the bargain, to be frank i don't even remember Cabbage's backstory hell i'd go as far as to say they didn't even make a backstory for him besides the reason he went to jail, he falls into the category of \"Big sweet guy who's shitty at everything\", he never really gets the limelight at all, his character isn't flushed out and the development of him is absolutely abysmal, i still don't understand why he's in the show besides to fill the archtype of \"Typical big guy\"\\n\\n\r\nTadayoshi Tooyama (Soldier)\\n\r\nOkay remember what i wrote about cabbage? it applies to soldier, uninteresting and just kind of there, he gets the least amount of light out of all the characters, hell EVEN THE SUPPORTING CHARACTERS GET MORE LIGHT THAN THIS ONE, just terribly designed and shouldn't even exist.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 7\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nCharacters - 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\\n\r\nWhile the character progression is really bad except for a few (Joe, Mario, Turtle) i don't find this to be a terrible anime, infact it's still a really good anime but the characters just fall short some by not alot (Joe) and some by way too much (Soldier/Cabbage) it's a good watch and it's fun to watch some parts made me actually feel emotions towards something that happens which rarely happens to me that is why i'm giving this anime a solid 8!\\n\\n\r\none last thing, the supporting characters are mostly better than the main characters, personally i'd give the main characters a 6 and the supporting characters an 8.\\n",

It should be watched by everyone who thinks that there are not any more anime that could surprise them - this one definetely will be a strong proof of perfection! The story held in the anime make you heart break from the first second, accompanied with the amazing opening, narration, ending, and tension. Art was done in the best traditions of anime - beautiful beyond belife! Sound, Character - everything is spectacular and will not leave you with pokerface -it is truly a masterpiece of its genre and I am amazed by the fact this anime was watched so few times, hope my review will wake up the interest for that piece of gold to feel the atmosphere of those times of war and how young boys, the main characters of the anime, will handle it!

            "content": "*Spoiler Free*\r\nAfter reading the synopsis, I was immediately interested and the reviews seemed to be popping out with excellent scores. This story is an immediate 10/10 for many reasons. Quick overview: The storyline and characters are so deep and compelling that it just has to be a 10/10. Watch this anime, you won't regret it.\r\nFirstly what is this story about: Simple, it's about a bond shared between 7 cellmates in a reformatory prison. This story goes so in depth that this bond surpasses any other \"bro-ship\" you can think of (even the one between Bulat and Tatsumi in akame ga kill). The things these sevenmen are willing to do for each other will warm the hearts of anyone and everyone.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6 teens are sent to a reformatory prison due to their own crimes (most involved stealing or violence). Though the reformatory prison is very much so \"Hell on Earth\" the 6 boys manage to meet another cellmate who would change their lives for the ever:Rokurouta Sakuragi (AKA BRO-CHAN).\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline is so intense and deep that you'll have no other choice but to watch the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Each has their own sad past, leaving the viewers pitying them for growing up in hellish conditions. Only negative of the anime is that they didn't go into depth about two certain character's passed but nevertheless you are still shown hints of their past in the O.P. The antagonists in this anime are so evil and detailed that you'll be leaving them on your top 10 antagonist list.\\n\\n\r\nSound: A 10/10. The opening fits perfectly with the theme and the anime's title. Secondly, there are times when Americans will be talking in English and it sounds normal. I've watched so many animes where the English of Non-Japanese and Japanese anime characters has been so cringe-worthy.\\n\\n",

This anime was amazing.\r\nThe story follows 6 young men who get sent to jail based on their reasons and mistakes from the past because of the hard times they lived through. It's based after the war in japan. The characters follow a man they meet in Jail as their cellmate and learn that they should follow their dreams even if they are being threatened. They face life's hardest challenges and even death. The art was great for it'stime. The music and soundtrack was great and greatly went with the mood and theme of the show. There was great character development for only 24 episodes shown. I greatly enjoyed the show, like literally I was hooked. Overall it was an amazing show and I recommend it to anybody over the age of 14 because there are some disturbing parts because it's so realistic.",

By the time I had finished the first episode, I knew that I was totally wrong. I could barely stop watching it.\r\nThe story is so interesting yet so grim and dark that you can't help but feel bad for the characters. As you watch it, you just want the best for these characters because of everything they've gone through.\r\nThe songs are amazing. The opening's awesome and makes you hypedup to watch the anime and the ending is a good cool down song that makes you just want to process everything that's happened. The OSTs are also very memorable and fitting.\\n\\n\r\nThe art's really unique. You don't really see anime with that type of art. It actually matches the art style of the manga. The animation is good as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters seem complex and human enough. They're definitely not self inserts. They're characters with personalities of their own that you, as a watcher, can relate to and understand.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no big issue with this anime...it's just a few small ones. The first issue is about the characters backstories. They didn't really go into the backstories of Soldier and Cabbage. If you're not paying attention to that, then it won't seem like too much of a problem. As a person who was looking forward to learning more about Soldier and Cabbage, I was a bit disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThe next issue is with...a certain event. There was a very important and serious moment in this anime and I just felt like it could've played out a bit differently. It was supposed to be a moment when the viewer got emotional and sad. It worked but only partially. Even though I was extremely sad while it was happening, I just kept saying \"why?\" over and over again in my head. The way certain things happened then was almost weird in a way. But, again, if you're not looking into it very much, then I doubt that you'll see anything wrong with it.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin is a mature anime with substance. Despite it's flaws, I say that it still earns a 10.",

            "content": "There is graphic violence and a LOT of moments that will make you cringe... this is not for the faint of heart. That being said, this is an excellent anime. If you can take ups and downs and some heartache this is one of the most powerful tales of friendship and comradery I've ever seen in any medium. You will cry from pure emotion at how strong the bond is between the Criminal Seven from Cell Block 2-6. I strongly recommend basically everyone watch this one.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThis is where you may dislike the story a bit if you're a perfectionist. There are quite a fewplot drivers that are unrealistic and thinking them through too much makes big chunks of the story fall apart. Trying to avoid spoilers, the boys have dirt on the head of the prison they are in and this causes them to catch a LOT of animosity. That being said, they have several instances of contact with the outside world where they could get that info to the media and fix their circumstances (though this would remove the source of drama). \\n\\n\r\nPutting that aside, the story is fantastic if you aren't looking to ruin it. Everything ties together nicely, there are huge ups and downs. In the end, everything is resolved and nothing feels rushed; you know the ending of all characters and you will feel satisfied that you know their futures. It is a miracle that the last episode does such an excellent job of wrapping everything up, I never would have guessed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nI love the character models; each of the boys is unique and the choice for hyper realism only enhanced the grittiness of the story. The use of colors truly elevates or darkens the mood.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nExcellent cast of voice actors. Everyone sounds exactly as you'd imagine them sounding. The music enhances the mood... the way the intro song plays into the last episode is epic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is where the anime truly shines. The characters are all amazing; good or evil they are all done SO well. You understand everyone's emotions and the cast is truly diverse (complex characters like Mario and Undercover and simple characters like Cabbage and Soldier). They manage to bring in new characters even into the last episode that will have you on an emotional roller coaster. Characters go through trials and tribulations and truly grow; the one thing that is unwavering is the bond the 7 boys have with each other.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed every episode. I couldn't wait for the next one! The only thing that set me back was the dread that things could go wrong... that is the vibe of the anime; at any moment something could go wrong. In the end I found this most enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nIf you let slide the plot holes and the grimness/grittiness that exists, this anime is a masterpiece. Maybe it is because of those things it is a masterpiece. I suggest everyone who hasn't seen this watch it!\\n",

            "content": "While very idealized, this show is a good portrayal of post WWII Japan and of general Japanese-American sentiment.  You get a look at the internal problems that were plaguing the nation during the war and afterwards.  The show gets you to hate characters you're supposed to hate, and to love characters you're supposed to love.  It also looks good.  So basically, it's a good and well-made anime.  My only problems with it were a soundtrack that didn't always reflect the tone of the events that they were playing behind, and characters that, for me, seemed to fall flat when thinkingabout more than whether or not they're badass and good shonen heroes and whatever (@Mario and Sakuragi).  Generally, this show had a lot of potential with its setting and story, but the music and characters didn't allow it to reach the heights that it could have with its premise.  \\n\\n\r\nIt's still a pretty good watch though.  I highly recommend it ^_^",

            "content": "(writing this review just finishing the 16th episode.)\r\nYou know when a show is really good? when it can pull you in and pour gasoline on you to blaze up your emotions. And boy do we have a roller-coaster on our hands here. \r\nRainbow is a story taking place right after WWII, of 7 kids going through their day's in a correction facility. due to either criminal behavior or unfortunate circumstances.\r\nStarting off I was pretty worried about Rainbow having a cast of 7 people in it's main roster. which is quite difficult, considering you have to get us attached to each individual in the group foreverything to really matter. And while some members of the group get a little less attention they still have an active and heartfelt role in the group. I was convinced some where just going to act as padding but I was thankfully wrong. \\n\\n\r\nIf I did have some issue on the characters it would have to be the \"villains\". Don't get me wrong they're not written bad at all, but they come a across just a little too cartoonishly \"evil\" at some points, which just felt a little over the top for this kind of series. I'd have like to see a tad more of a realistic take, or at least some redeemable qualities to make them a bit more human.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the strongest aspects of Rainbow is it's atmosphere. there's a lot of suspenseful moments that reward you greatly. the gritty and dirty feeling inside the prison feels very genuine and you know any positive moment can easily backlash to something else. Which just keeps you on edge numerous times. even if you know what's coming you're still eager to see how it play's out. Aside from sad and content I even got Angry at the results of certain scenario's. It made me realize how invested I was \\n\r\nin the moment. \\n\\n\r\nLets see what else..., Animation and Music...pffttt it's Madhouse we're talking about here! They don't have to prove themselves. it's all solid in this department!\\n\\n\r\nSo far the only \"bad\" thing about the entire series is episode 13. and that's only because it's the re-cap episode. For the story it's trying to tell and the way they tell it the anime is practically flawless up to this point.\\n\\n\r\nI just hope they can live up to my expectations for the second half.\\n\r\nbut even still I don't see myself scoring Rainbow with anything lower then a 9 at this point.\\n",

            "content": "\"I get by with a little help from my friends\" -The Beatles \r\nLet's be honest, when I first saw this anime listed on MAL, the title and the poster with all the angsty looking boys kinda gave me the wrong impression, but maybe that's what was needed for me to discover this hidden gem of an anime. Watching this anime was like a riding a rollercoaster of emotions and for the first time in ages I found myself yelling at my computer in fear or excitement for the characters as the story progressed. \r\nThe story is about not about the type of \"boys love\" thatthe title led me to believe but its the type of boys love that makes you all warm and fuzzy inside -- a story about trust, betrayal, forgiveness, loyalty, and knowing that even though life throws you some fucked-up shit your true friends will always be there to take that shit with you or help you kick its ass. Set in the backdrop of post WWII Japan, similar to that in Grave of the Fireflies, the war and its end had taken its toll on its citizens and its repercussions exhibit themselves in the Japanese youth. The pacing is excellent as well, not too long and not too short. I'm surprised that the producers were able to fit a good amount of material in 26 episodes without me feeling like they were dragging the story at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe use of a darker color palette was very appropriate in that it helped set the dark tone and the bleak world that the boys were living in. The color scheme also sort of gave it a historic feel for some reason, felt like I was watching Rurouni kenshin. The music, specifically the intro song \"You're not alone\" by coldrain, which had a style reminiscent of the type of music I listened to in my high school days, I felt captured the teenage angst portrayed by the characters, while preaching lyrics of hope and perseverance. Yes I had to download the song and listened to it many times. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are truly what make this anime special. The 26 episode length does an almost perfect job at developing each character and telling their stories. I can't even explain without spoiling... you just have to see for yourself. Its like you become part of their little group as you watch more and more... you will cry (and/or yell at the computer) when when bad shit happens to them or when someone tries to screw them over, you will cry when their hearts are broken, you will cry when they cry manly tears of happiness. I don't think I can cry for another year. And that's how much I love these characters. The evil baddies are EVIL and YOU WILL HATE THEM.\\n\r\n*Also on a side note --- An-chan and Mario are total hotties, for those of you who appreciate a little man candy.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime surprisingly plays up a few different themes -- has a little bit of sports, a little romance, a little bit of music, etc, which made it entertaining to watch. Together with its gripping story, amazing cast of characters, and satisfying ending, I think people should give this anime a chance. Sure there's a lot of adult themes explicitly illustrated to help tell the story (You will likely be disturbed with the amount of violence and sexual abuse), I think that it was necessary to get you (or me at least) to really sympathize with the characters. But with struggles and obstacles, you really get to see the characters shine when they overcome them with a little help from their friends.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"What is life without happiness?\"   \r\n    Before I start this review I should first point out that this anime wasn't suppose to a action or an overly suspenseful anime, instead it's suppose to be a show about ex inmates from a disciplinary school and their life after being free. So if you're disappointed in this anime because it moved from the addicting setting inside the school to a more of a slice of life, drama anime outside of prison then you are disrespecting this anime since the anime wasn't intended to be about them in disciplinary school but out ofit.\\n\r\n   Story: Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin in my opinion has the best story I've ever seen, its unoriginal setting separates it from all the animes that we love. The story is about ex inmates and their struggles after getting free and how their friendship develops, this shows a real life situation since in our society ex inmates are actually having a hard time blending into and being accept by society. It delivered a different and realistic setting in a form of anime which we never get a chance to see anywhere else, what surprised me is how much this show is underrated with only about 107 000 members. WTF\\n\\n\r\n   Sound and Art: The art is very sharp and smartly coordinated, it's not abstract at all instead it's very sharp and detailed as if it was a real tv show, its sharpness is to the point before it gets weird, good work on that part! The sound is pretty regular and nothing special, it has a attractive 1:15min opening where you can feel emotional even in that.\\n\\n\r\n   Characters: Some character is extremely developed while some are brushed off to the side and said \"you probably know what this character is like without a background story\", a clear example of this is Matsuura, Mansaku (Cabbage). Characters like Yokosuka, Jou(Joe) orMaeda, Noboru (Turtle) has their background shown and really focuses on how they develop. Overall the character are either well done or brushed off to the side, but the ones that are well done deserves a round of applause and are worthy in your favourites list!\\n\\n\r\n   Overall: This show was very enjoyable and emotion as I gripped my blanket holding back any physical emotions (Such as crying :P). I would recommend this anime to anyone who watches anime in general, it's a must see.\\n\r\n                        Things to take out of this anime\\n\r\n                               1.

            "content": "Wow. This anime was just.....wow. It was a roller-coaster. If you don't mind getting caught up in your feelings, I'd highly recommend watching this. Fair warning: it's a psychological anime, so it'll fuck with your mind a little bit.  \r\n10/10 Story: VERY unique. I don't believe I've ever watched an anime like this before. It's actually in a way realistic. It just draws you in from the beginning. You have these broken characters and you want to know why they're so broken. After episode 14, I did feel that it dragged on a little bit. Nonetheless, it was still amazing. Crazy good plot.\r\n----------\r\n10/10 Art:Very refreshing art. Some of the best art I've seen in a long time. It gave me Attack On Titan art vibes and I just loved it. \\n\r\n----------\\n\r\n8/10 Sound: I REALLY loved the ending and opening songs. They were great. One was in English and that surprised me. It's kind of rock n' roll and that was a plus for me.\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\n10/10 Characters: Great character development. Not all of the characters were likable (watch the anime and you'll find out why). However, every character did serve a purpose. The main characters all came to specific realizations in their lives.\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nOverall 8/10: It wasn't the best anime I've ever watched, but it was pretty damn good. I honestly wish there was a little more romance. The ending was good, although I would've changed it a little bit. Overall, I think it's a great anime.",

            "content": "DaikiClub Bro Time-Saver Review:\r\nBLUF: Rainbow Nisha is absolutely fantastic and if you like emotional yet entertaining stories, this is the anime for you. 9/10\r\nStory- The story is a mixture of episodic and overarching theme. The 7 young men are all detention kids and the overall theme is their transformation to successful men, rather than hoodlums. The episodic stories provide the key elements for character development. The stories have a few twists and turns, but are mostly just classic \"friendship and effort conquers all\" stories.\r\nArt- The art is solid and I liked it, but there's nothing special. The one unique thing that some people may hateis there is alot of narration over frozen shots. The still images have a drawn feel to them and I kind of liken it to narration over the manga. I liked it.\\n\\n\r\nSound- The opening track, voices, score, and narration are all godly. That is all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- The main characters all develop and have arcs to them. I think the show did a fantastic job creating likable, yet dichotic young men. From the opening scene to the closing conversation you have an emotional tie to the characters and you want to watch more.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- If you like emotional things that aren't over feminized or all romantic, this is the anime for you. I loved it. There were scenes that made me legitimately happy, sad, and angry.  It's only 26 episodes and you'll probably clear it in a couple weeks tops. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR- Watch this anime, it's awesome.",

            "content": "For myself, the hardest reviews are the creative works that have given me a mixed reaction. If I feel something's bad, it's easy to pick out the numerous flaws, and if I feel something's good, it's easy to pick out the numerous strengths. Mixed bag shows, however, gravitate somewhere in the middle of these two opposites. As much as they do wrong, they also do right. \r\nRainbow, unfortunately, falls in this mixed bag category. I say unfortunately because the show had a crazy amount of potential from the get-go. A historical drama set in a reformatory school during post-war Japan? That sounds great already. Andyou know what? There were actually moments of brilliance in this anime. That's why it makes this all the more disappointing that Rainbow never truly lived up to its potential. \\n\\n\r\nIf I break down Rainbow's negatives, I'm left with three major problems. First, this anime has a tendency to needlessly force drama onto the characters and plot. For example, there were several times that characters, who were good and at some point underwent character development, suddenly had face-heel turns without an ounce of foreshadowing. This, along with the variety of small-time assholes that are attracted to the main cast like Winny the Pooh is to honey, gives the impression that their sole existence in this show is to create drama for the plot. I get that post-war Japan was not the best place, but there's only so much of the same drama you can create before it gets predictable. \\n\\n\r\nSecond, every time that goddamn narrator pops in when the show's art goes all pastel. If you ever wanted to know what the anime equivalent of when video games beat unnecessary tutorials over their players' heads was, then here you go. Seriously, every time this happens, it's so damn distracting. It stops whatever is happening in the story, usually a dramatic moment, so the writers can tell the viewers what is going. Is it REALLY that necessary to tell me what Mario is thinking? Think back, have you ever had a teacher tell you that, in your writing, you should \"show\" not \"tell\"? Can't the studio just show me what he's thinking through his actions, or do they have to explain to me everything like we're all morons. There were countless times when I was trying to interpret out a character's actions or words, when suddenly, the narrator chimes in to tell you the exactly how to interpret the current scene. If I'm not allowed to think about what I'm watching, and draw my own conclusions, why in the hell am I bothering to watch it in the first place? In a different context, it would be borderline propaganda.\\n\\n\r\nThird, Rainbow has a lot of build up, and it can be great, but the payoff doesn't usually live up to it. Around halfway through the show, there is a potentially series defining scene, but is ruined because the whole situation surrounding the scene seemed easily avoidable. With a few exceptions, this reoccurs in every arc of Rainbow.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this all the more painful is that Rainbow really isn't a bad show. It does have standout moments that are suspenseful, tragic, and heartfelt. That's what surprising about this anime. Just when you're about to write off, it does something really cool. And then the narrator speaks up and ruins everything. \\n",

            "content": "Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin\r\nWhen I first layed my eyes on Rainbow I didn't think much of it.\r\nAn anime about the life of being in jail, sounds pretty simple right? But boy was I wrong. Inmate Sakuragi knowing of a dark secret that unfolded years ago in the Reform Jail. Is haunted endlessly by a corrupt guard & perverted Doctor, who's goal is nothing more than keep that dark secret from reaching the light of day. Forcing Sakuragi in an empty life behind bars. Following this exhilarating story of the bonds of friendship, dreams, & the struggle for survival. Our main characters look to aidtheir fellow cell mate Sakuragi from the evil clutches of the antagonists. With no stop in the constant flow of action, even dare to blink and you're guaranteed to miss a good part. There's no denying how absolutely brutal and hard of a tone this anime is. Masters at expressing these dark tones, the violent atmosphere, & the realness of the anime. Makes it one of the best thriller anime's I've watched to date. Definitely not something for the weak of heart, sorry kids!\\n\\n\r\nLet's not get hung up on only the story though. Rainbow deserves a lot more praise than just on its amazing plot. The music choice that is used in Rainbow deserves some too. It's like listening to a track brought down by the Angels themselves. I don't think they could of used any better music than what they did. As well as using those glorious tunes in the right moment is also key, which btw they nailed. I found myself even humming the songs. I guarantee you that there is no episode that wont have a song worthy of a place in your playlist.\\n\\n\r\nAlternately, another thing going for Rainbow is the characters. Emphasizing again on the realness of the anime. The characters are portrayed in a manner that complements the anime's heaviness.\\n\r\nThe showing of many different layers each character has. The feelings that you get, where its almost as if you are watching real people go through these hardships. The emotional impact that each character undergoes, makes it almost impossible not to sympathize with them.\\n\\n\r\nLess enjoyable factors about Rainbow do exist however.\\n\r\nThe art isn't anything that will have your jaw dropping. This isn't necessarily a bad thing though. It's not like it makes me gauge my eyes out or anything. It's just completely average, nothing really special about it except for a something here and there. Rainbow also suffers from pacing issues. The story takes a hit here, where the 2nd half of the anime feels rushed in episodes. Almost as if we're skipping from one idea to the next.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, I still greatly enjoyed Rainbow. From the speechless emotional moments, to the fantastic music produced. I would recommend this for anyone mature enough to take it.",

The story takes place during the aftermath of the Attack on Pearl Harbor, in where the Americans dropped an atomic bomb on Japan. This event plunges Japan into a certain unlawful darkness. It is now up to these fellows to find a way to survive and live out their dreams.\r\nThe characters in this anime are extraordinarily well done in terms of background. Piece by piece each character is unraveled to the viewer, allowing us to understand howthey ended up in such a situation. Each character is distinct and adds their own perspective to the matter at hand, allowing for complex problems to be solved in really interesting ways at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe dark and gruesome anime surprisingly sheds an extreme amount of light onto the viewer by turning outrageous situations into hopeful circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10 - The plot is implicitly defined from the start of the anime, which begins to morph at a climax in the story into numerous dreams to be fulfilled. The great part is that each dream turns into a story of its own.\\n\r\nGraphics - 9 - Great lighting, water effects, character expressions, and detailed action scenes.\\n\r\nSound - 9 - Big thumbs up mainly because I am a rocker fan.\\n\r\nCharacters - 10 - Astounding job on the background stories and distinct nature of each character, plus the portraying of evil characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9.5 Wicked anime. It almost tortured my soul to watch certain events take place and the anime kept me thoroughly enthralled, however because of the dark nature I felt I couldn't finish the anime in one night.\\n\r\nRecommended - Absolutely!

Before I started to watch the fist episode of this anime, I thought to myself \"I hope that this is anime start off with a bang.\" In fact, it started off with an explosion! Out of the anime that I've seen so far, this is one that tackles a genuine and honest theme. The theme of loyalty, bravery, and sacrifice for people other than yourself. \r\nTrust is something that is earned. This anime teaches you that even though people and this world may be cruel, there is a friend in this world that you are destined to meet. This friend willalways have your back and stick with you through the very end. Even if you do not have that friend right now, this anime becomes that comfort for you. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were well built starting from the first episode. There are a few characters who do not get as developed as others but this doesn't take away from the anime at all. The art style throughout the anime can be dark but then comforting and bright at times. The sound and music for this series is pretty good. The intro and ending themes are masterpieces. \\n\\n\r\nIn retrospect, I cannot praise this anime enough. My enjoyment for this show overflows. Keep in mind that this anime does contain some graphic/gory scenes. However, it's an anime about overcoming life's obstacles. \\n\\n\r\nI present to you, the POWERFUL series of Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin. Enjoy.",

            "content": "Intro:\r\nThis show presents the darkness of reality, a violent world filled with betrayal, madness, deceit and injustice. It shows coruption at its finest, the post-war way of living and dying in the japanese prison and the outside life that awaits a former convict. Rainbow shows us how important it is to have dreams and how important it is to have friends that help you follow those dreams\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nRainbow tells the story of seven teenagers who are found guilty of serious crimes and are sent to a disciplinary school that ultimately becomes their hell. Rainbow thells the story of seven close friends and their path tofreedom as well as presenting their pain and sacrifice. The plot is well planned but it does have plot holes such as Sakuragi\u2019s death etc and is predictable at times. I really loved the brotherhood theme of the story.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the plot holes:\\n\r\n- It is said that Sakuragi \u201ekilled\u201d his father but his father commited suicide, how did Sakuragi end up in a disciplinary school?\\n\r\n- If the boys in the reformatory can go to the library whenever the please, why do they hang out in the cell?\\n\r\n- How come noone investigated the fire that almost killed 7 inmates?\\n\r\n- Why does a doctor seem to control the disciplinary school?\\n\r\n- When Sakuragi is made to starve and the good guard tries to help Sakuragi, the antagonists kill the good guard. Why is it easier to kill a fellow gurad that to kill a convict?\\n\r\n- Why was Ishihara not arrested for stabbing Sakuragi?\\n\r\n- No arc for Soldier?\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters have various diffrent personalities that change and develop over time. They all have  interesting backstories and each of them has someting unique about themselves. The character development is also very good, for example Mario is portayed in the begining to be weak and in the end presented as a man that can take care of himself or Baremoto who gradually developed from not trusting anyone to making life-long friends he would take a bullet for. The antagonists were well built becoming very real and frightening. \\n\\n\r\nI felt like the creator had a misogynistic side, almost every women either has ill intent and is deceitful or she has to sell her body in order to achieve her goals. For example, Baremoto\u2019s mother sold her body for food, Lilly had to sell her body to the american general, hoping to get a visa for the U.S., Jon\u2019s manager uses him as a sex slave, Joe\u2019s orphanage director used him as a sex slave, etc.\\n\r\nI also disliked how the relationship between Mario and the nurse, Setsuko ended. Even though Setsuko and Mario loved each other, described as \u201eblinding love\u201d, she agreed to be engaged with another \u201erich\u201d man. Even though the night before her wedding day, they confessed their love and Setsuko had sex with Mario she still went on and got married. I once heard a joke: \u201eLove him for who he is not for his money. He is a man not a bank\u201d, I think this applies to Setsuko\u2019s case but on the other hand, maybe she was waiting for Mario to fight for her.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\r\nAs expected of Madhouse, artwork and character design successfully captures the gloomy and depressing atmosphere of the post-war Japan. Animation in general was nothing fancy, but consistent throughout the series and relatively pleasing to the eye. I think the dark and gloomy artstyle and collors are very well suited to the theme of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening theme \u201eWe\u2019re not alone\u201d and the ending are very good. They both do an excellent job of conveying the message of bonds and not giving up, which showcases the show's values perfectly. The show itself doesn't have a lot of music but when there is music it does work very well in tandem with the show and does a good job of capturing the mood.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nThe first arc was very good and interesting while the arcs that followed were weaker but still failry interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.0/10\\n\r\nRainbow is a good and intriguing anime series that may be boring at times but ends up being interesting I would recommend Rainbow to anyone who is able to stomach this kind of anime.\\n\\n\r\nTrue friends \u2013 No matter how bad things get, they will always be there to carry through. \\n",

A little more character development could've been done but that's a small complaint. I've heard ppl complaining about the opening song. Personally I love the opening since Coldrain is one of my favorite bands. Also the title has taken punches for being too melodramatic....and yeah it kinda is but who cares since it's about the actual anime. I love this anime and would recommend it to anyone over 15. Anime fans ..and peoplein general should watch this anime as it is really unique and has a good plot. It is dark yea but it's also great. It keeps you interested and even if you are grossed out (which you prolly are lol like me) by some parts you still have the feeling that you really wanna watch this even if it is so brutal and sadistic. It's a really good series and worth checking out. I love it and so do many of you. I've now watched it about 3 times (all 22 episodes so far) ..not kidding. This anime has made a great impact on me. \\n\\n\r\nTell me what you want , I f****ng love it! ^^",

            "content": "Rainbow:  Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin is THE best anime I have ever watched so far.  \r\nStory - 10/10  The story followed 6 young people who were sent to shonen reformatory and the struggles they go through.  I think it's based on how important friendship is, and I usually don't really care about that because it's so common, but the ties between the characters in Rainbow is are just so touching and heart warming...   It is filled with drama and the storyline is just so great.  There's some cheesy parts here and there but they're well done.  There'svery little anime that interests me as much as this one.  I really like the setting too, because a lot of animes now adays are about people in school, or a harem, or people with super powers.  Rainbow is a nice change of pace, since it was set in a dark prison place and after a war in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10  I know everyone has different tastes in art, but a lot of anime art icks me.  I really liked the art in this anime though, it's clean and doesn't have the oversized eyes stuff.  The body proportions are well done too, since a lot of anime make the female characters look like 10 year olds and give them eyes that take up half of their head and a tiny body.  However, it may take a few episodes to get used to it if you're used to watching anime with big eyes/colored hair/ etc...\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10  I really liked the opening song.  It fit the anime really well, and the songs played at each scene also fit the mood.  The soundtracks in this anime were really epic and beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10  The characters here aren't the usual Mary/Gary Stu or Tsunders, they have real personalities, and in realistic personalities have flaws.  Each of the characters have their own flaws, but flaws are what makes a character lovable.  Another thing I like is that they didn't make the male characters all \"bishies\" or extremely good looking.  I gave it a 9/10 instead of a 10/10 because sometimes I feel that the antagonists are  such completely screwed up @ssholes that it's not really realistic.  It's like they're 100% evil with no ounce of non-evil in them xD.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10 hands down.  Didn't bore me, didn't annoy me, kept me longing for the next episode until I found out there was no more...\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10  I can't believe how this show isn't that popular.  This is definitely the best anime I have ever watched (so far)",

Police brutality, prison guards running amuck, corruption within the penitentiary system, and, of course, the consequences of WWII for Japan itself. \r\nThe story is told from the point of view of the primary characters and swings back and forth between all ofthem, not to an equal degree, but all of them get decent screen time. Each episode has a story to it that is horrifically relatable. The suspense was definitely very well executed, and the honesty of the story - without embellishments, realistic endings \u2013\u00a0was what made it amazingly good. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is very well done, it is the type of art that I personally enjoy in anime, and certain highlights of the scenes that mattered were executed very well. The character designs were memorable and ever-evolving. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing \u2013\u00a0though some people dislike the opening, I find it incredibly good and very summarizing to the rest of the series. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed every moment of the characters' journey and I really wish there were more of such bare, honest stories in anime today.",

            "content": "Rainbow is a show about the criminal seven of cell 2-6. Seven boys who, for better or worse, get sent to a disciplinary school and form a deep bond of friendship. Throughout the show, this friendship deepens and we get a lot more depth as these characters develop from beginning to end. Now let me just say, the show isn't as graphic as I expected but if you don't want to see implied rape or anything of the sort, I recommend skipping this show. If you can handle A Clockwork Orange, you'll be fine though.\r\nLet's get a few negatives out of the way here first,because they are rather large. One of the biggest negatives in the series is that it is very vague about why these boys ended up in cells. I like my stories to generally be a little more full circle. Now it doesn't detract from the show, but in the end you are left wondering why. Another big negative is one of the characters at the end doesn't get his own arc. Now this is due to the show ending before the manga, but it's an oversight. One episode would have been plenty, as another character had only a one episode arc and it was one of the best in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall story of Rainbow in the first half of the show is actually the weakest part. Now I don't say this to be negative, it's actually pretty amazing, because the first half of the show is gripping. The story of these boys going through their struggles was dark, but when the second half came around and we got character arcs for all of them, ones that are so emotionally touching and well made, I couldn't help but see the show a bit differently. How it builds up the darkness in the first half to something much brighter in the second. It was beautifully deliberate, but it never felt like it was.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters had memorable nicknames, memorable backstories and very memorable arcs. Some of the most emotionally gripping arcs I've seen in anime, and they each made me tear up by the end. The buildup all led to an emotional payoff. Something I don't see much in many anime. There was an amount of closure in each arc that felt so satisfying. Another one of the biggest positives here that I have to mention. Villains. By gods, did this show do villains brilliantly. Sure, they were fairly one dimensional, but my god, I still hated them. \\n\\n\r\nNow there's a lot of cheese in this show. It's melodramatic. Although I never once felt any sense of cringe in the type of melodrama presented. Rather, it felt very real and very well-done. The two big negatives in the series itself do hurt it. I was torn honestly. I wanted to give the show that perfect score, but these negatives really do make the show feel somewhat incomplete, which is unfortunate. But don't let that stop you, Rainbow is a feels trip. It will make you angry, laugh, cry and really feel for the struggles of each character. It's a must watch. It's a cheesy 1950s melodrama with a ton of heart put into making it, and it deserves your attention.",

It's a very unique and rare gem that deserves a lot more attention.\r\n Everything was perfect: The animation was gorgeous as expected of MadHouse ,the music was excellent/fitting, very realistic/interesting characters, fantastic voice acting, and amazing story/plot. \r\nEVERYONE that watched it loved it (not to mention me.) I cried, laughed, and was never bored. I was hooked and at the edge of my seat till the very end. \r\nMy advise is to have a mature mind and be aware that the situations,conditions,etc. canhappen in real life. It's rated 17 plus, but NOT b/c of intense violence/gore or hentai crap, it's for REAL LIFE disturbing stuff. Oh, and don't misunderstand the name \"Rainbow.\" It has a deeper meaning than you think. \\n\r\nJust watching the opening will get you sucked in. You're going to love Rainbow b/c it has a theme about deep emotions, hard times, friendship, and hope. \\n\r\nWell, to wrap this up: Instant classic with very few flaws, have a mature mind and NOT for kiddies,I'm getting the DVDs asap, and this gem will forever shine in my heart. I hope you watch/enjoy it.See More",

            "content": "'' We believe that the explicit scenes of this animation are particularly important to portray the atmosphere of that period of time. '' Aham. \r\nThe episode begins by showing a little further to the story, this can \r\nsometimes be a good feature in the narrative, but it gives a glimpse of what we will have in the course of the story. You can take some of the tension off.\r\nAfter that, we have the cast to be shown, which are a troupe of young \r\noffenders who are going to a reformatory inside a bus, here happens a scene that already demonstrates what isto come in this anime. Silly drama.\\n\\n\r\nInside the bus, people obviously whisper about these young people, how absurd they are on a public transport, in that slide a girl drops her plush toy, then a young man picks it up and tries to give it to her, in this scene there is a attempt to raise awareness with this character, since it\u2019s a convenient scene; the girl in fear rejects the good option of the boy, along with his hysterical mother, just to do more silly and caricature drama. When they come down, she throws the toy toward them. I'm crying.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, here comes the little shit guard (irrelevant this character) one-dimensional sadist who gives a beating to the boy who did this good deed, this is just banal; is trying to shock who's watching. Because this guard is a character, not only bad, but only to cause dislike, it\u2019s impossible to see a person there, so caricature and no layers of personality.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, there is narration in this anime, trying to explain what is happening. I say this is bad because then the anime fails to try showing it all by itself. Placing a narrator to try to expose us what is being shown on the screen, when the scenes alone are not capable of such a feat. A narrator being put in some decisive points in a work is good, but to put it to explain to you about almost everything is lousy.\\n\\n\r\nContinuing. It's already half the episode and you do not know the names of any of the 6 boys (laughs). They finally reach the goal of the episode, the reformatory. There more shit ... A one-dimensional doctor, possibly a pedophile (I'm sure) who acts as caricature as possible. Being serene, saying things like '' pretty girls '', '' I liked this ''; you can imagine the level of this character, which is another shit. More to bump into, the one-dimensional, motherfucking doctor daughter puts a glass stick into their anus (yes, that's right) and the sadistic guardian gives a mock beating in one of the boys. Hence the narrator explains to us that this is done so they show no sign of disobedience, wow.\\n\\n\r\nNow, finally getting to the fucking cell, you still do not know their names, none, nothing. They meet another character, the seventh kid. Now, the main cast is closed. Already it was not enough the sow exposure of the main characters, having one-dimensional, caricatures; but this character here is an edgy, cool guy who acts superior, is silent, does not shake, is their Senpai. Anyway, Senpai says shit there for the 6 stooges, saying they're trash anyway, nobody cares about them and blah blah. Could not miss, right? They fight...\\n\\n\r\nWhich is great. The Senpai is giving a blowjob to each one of them, but the captives insist on going one at a time to him, in a closed cell that would be very easy to corner him easily. It\u2019s too stupid, it\u2019s an aggravating defect in many works, go one at a time to give chances to the solitary fighter. And again, confirming what I said earlier, about the narration expose what anime cannot.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s the narrator who says their name to the viewer and to tell a little about their characteristics. It's comic, but it's that way. The narrator goes on to say: Name, age, nickname and offenses. Just that. Another detail, is when each one is being knocked out that is told us their names, wow great 10/10. By the way, almost all offenses, in a way, are understandable. What? The boys have done almost nothing wrong, it's the cruel world that makes people act like that. As I've already said, it's another attempt to make us all the more sensitized to the cast, which really sucks.\\n\\n\r\nThen after all this drama, comes one of the most stupid dialogues I've ever seen in my life. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the assholes:\\n\\n\r\n\u2014 Kill me, kill me ...\\n\\n\r\nAnother asshole:\\n\\n\r\n\u2014 Take this (a cigarette) and spare my life, please. \\n\\n\r\n??????????????????????\\n\\n\r\nOne-dimensional sadistic guard arrives at the last minute. Already coming with their bullshit, saying, Well, well, what do we have here? It could have killed at least one ... \\n\\n\r\nFor some very stupid reason, he decides to whip Senpai, who decides to take all the blame for the mess (now, now). Guard starts hitting him, laughing at him, joking and going. In that event, he calls the idiots to beat him too, but they refuse. Obvious, right? The Friendship of the Brothers is already being built, how? Course, by almost killing themselves, by the stupid Senpai ark with all the blame, by the whole cast of the goons are one-dimensional and be thrilled by the noble act of who beaten them. How cute, what the fuck that shit. \\n\\n\r\nCould be worse? Of course. The doctor motherfucker comes in and makes the guard stop joking about the boys with all that shit. '' Beautiful boys '', '' experiments '', '' I'm going to have fun with them yet '', meaning a lot of trash of a bad character.\\n\\n\r\nComing to the end of the episode. The friendship is already built with Senpai and the assholes, so what? Wow, for a cigarette. Seriously, they all smoke the SAME cigarette that the idiot had. Oh, you're going to have that fucking ass in the ass. One of the dumbest things I've ever seen, right in the first episode. Oh, the episode ends with Senpai revealing his name and the cheeky, smiling laughers. Hope lives, lives in me of expecting something less worse in the next episodes. \\n\\n\r\nWell, the soundtrack is also not a compliment, it\u2019s poorly positioned and does not make sense in the scenes. It's a horrible, horrible direction, a director who does not even know the basics of the basics. Only thing I can say about them is that they're all ok.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "At the time of this review, I've dropped Rainbow after episode 14. If I ever finish watching and change my opinion, I'll come back to re-edit, but for now this is my opinion on the show so far. There are spoilers in this review.\r\nStory: 7/10. A serviceable story that gives insight into a time period that isn't well-known yet holds a lot of history. As the telling of a group of boys that learn how to stick together and bear the brunt of their tragedies, I think the show does a pretty good job but isn't without its flaws. After the group escapes from theprison, I found the story to be somewhat contrived and poorly paced. There seems to be an unevenness to the progression of the characters in the 'first arc' of the story. The episodes in the prison are well done and really underline the characters struggles; when the characters escape the prison, things feel rushed and contrived; and finally, when we end at the 'redemption' arc, things are too weirdly paced and left a sour taste in my mouth. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10. Really good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10. Outside of the opening and ending, I didn't really find any interesting tracks.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10. Given the show takes place in a realistic setting and is meant to depict a piece of history, it's to be expected that the characters won't be as dynamic or fantastical as characters you'd see in shounen. As a result, some people might perceive them as bland and too mediocre, which I think is an unfair criticism given that these characters aren't meant to be wide stretches of the imagination: they are depicting real people who suffered very real problems for the time period they live in. In this vein, the story does a good job at portraying this.\\n\\n\r\nBut the problem lies in how the story tries to motivate its plot through its characters in seemingly contrived ways. The biggest offender in my opinion is Bro's character, as he is the best character in the series and yet is utilized in almost insulting ways.\\n\\n\r\nBro's character hinges on loyalty to his friends, yet he decided to offend his dead friend by giving the annoying prisoner officer his suicide note, the last piece of evidence that could prove his friend's death was caused by corruption of the prison staff. I don't think Bro would EVER insult his friends, dead or alive, by doing this; yet to motivate the plot and have Bro die, the show decides to write this in. It's lazy writing imo and it takes away from who Bro is and what he stands for, and it really just puts a damper on everything the characters went through prior to this moment.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, although I've stated prior that the characters aren't meant to be fantastical or particularly engaging and deep, this doesn't mean the show's characters will captivate everyone. Even I have a hard time getting invested into personal characters, and the friendship dynamic is really the only engaging aspect all these characters share. Outside of this, the tragedies of the characters are either glossed over or not given due attention.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10. I really liked how the show started out, and would rate the episodes taking place in the prison as a 10/10. However, after they escape, the show steadily declines until it became painfully dull and uninteresting. I ended up dropping the show, but I might go back to continue.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10. I can see why people on both sides like or hate this show. It has a strong message but conveys it through characters are pretty bland on their own.",

            "content": "WHY IS NO ONE WATCHING THIS SHOW?! No one talks about it, no one talked about it when it came out. No one hyped it up. I don't get it. This should be seen by more people. It tells probably the most refined story of perseverance ever told in not only anime,but in any type of visual media,What am I talking about?\r\nRainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin (Rainbow:The Seven Criminals of Compound Two, Cell Six) is a long term tail of these seven teenagers, in disciplinary Shounan Special Reform School which is kinda like Juvie in the US, but in this show, these kids are prettymuch treated like criminals. These delinquents go through SO MUCH SHIT, and this is only the first half, I thought these people were straight up adults but then someone said they were like sixteen or seventeen, HOW? This show takes place after WW2 in Japan, but no way they treat kids like this. They get beaten for the smallest reasons and they suffer not only pain but also humiliation.But after every punch, they heal and grow more with the help of their superior, Sakuragi. It is violent of course, but there is a reason why instead of showing craziness for the sake of it. Before each episode,there is a disclaimer explaining why it is violent.Cuz it was like that back then. This show's first half is pretty much Shawshank Redemption but the second half of the show is soooo much better. The adversity in the second half is more organic and similar to what real-life is like and it speaks out more. One thing that might be unreliable  for some but a message i appreciate is how hard things get, a friend will help. It may sound cheesy, but whether it's a child's show or something more mature it is the case.It may not be like it now because this show takes place in the 50's, but if anyone asked of a show that really is a realistic example of overcoming hardship, this show would be my first recommendation(well at least the second half.)\\n\\n\r\nMadhouse made and while watching this and Monster simultaneously is that madhouse doesn't focusing on having fluid animation when their main goal is capturing the tone of the time. From the lighting,setting, and character designs,Madhouse was portraying how depressing,but not depressing, time that was after WW2. The animation is not outstanding but it doesn't need to be cuz these people don't have magic powers. The best thing this show has visually is these still frames made with overpowering colors . This happens at least twice an episode and when it happens, that's when you know shit goes down .Sometimes when it happens, also I like how the show is colorful, but not.Sure the palette is depressing and soggy, but there are some very colorful scenes as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe opening in the show scared the crap out of me when I first saw it. It was made by coldrain,a band that is pretty much like\"Fear and Loathing in LasVegas\" except without the autotune and the techno piano. I like it because it's catchy as heck, but what is weird about the song, is that these singers are screaming at the camera but the lyrics are uplifting.The ending is beautiful, not only that but, its one of those songs that start of slow, but then it swells and is so harmonious. The OST is like a more refined version of all those motivational osts online but it is more refined and has a twist of western.It incorporates Whistling, harmonica and guitar. The main theme is not only the best part of the soundtrack, but one of my favorite pieces from anything. There is just so much passion put into it and then the fucking horns kick in and the entire scene becomes a pivotal moment. It is just pure genius\\n\\n\r\nI'll try hard not to get into all of the characters because there are so many. Mario looks like he's the main character, but don't be fooled. Each episode focuses on each individual character and none of them get a good amount of screen time to be called a \"main character\".Sakuragi can be considered one, but he uhh.....\"takes a back seat\" in the second half. Each character is given development and even more development to top it all off. The characters themselves are so wonderful together, they are a very good example of what Friendship is supposed to look like.There are seven characters: Mario, Joe, Cabbage,Turtle,Scam,Soldier, and Sakuragi(yes I remembered their nicknames and not their actual names).These guys are very down to earth human beings. Despite the crimes they were arrested for and the terrible things they go through, the are still just juvenile teens.They all have a motive and they stick to-- well not all of them at least:/ There will be at least one person that you will relate to.The people around them though, I feel like it kinda victimizes adults, because if one adult is not salty about the war, the other is in a bad condition and treats the boys like crap. There are some adults that aren't that bad and they help the boys, but they are not in the second half AT ALL.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPeople please, stop watching those depressiing shows and stop watching those slice of life anime that you hate because you know that your life will never be like that, this show is a great coming of age tale about redemption and the upsides to having friends, and heck, if you don't have friends, just get arrested and maybe you can......no.. actually don't get arrested, But still, I wish more people watched this show and praised it, The downside is that the show is not available anywhere legally, so you may have to pull some strings, but it's really worth people, I mean come on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\r\n;-)",

            "content": "I wasn't born when and where this anime takes place, but i'm pretty sure that some of the setting is over-exaggerated (blatant understatement). The villains have absolutely ridiculous facial expressions and tendencies-you also get the feeling that every other character is inherently evil. The show heavily exploits shock factor in a large section but does so for a good reason- to contrast the main theme of the show: friendship (cue naruto music). The general quality of the show is generally pretty good though and it's managed to keep my attention. \r\ntldr: Some of the horror/psychological elements are pretty annoying and over the top, but Iwould still definitely recommend it for its interesting portrayal of a brotherhood that the viewer wants to see continue.",

I would dare to say that there is prostitution, slavery, and world wide corruption in the 21 first century among all the governments in the world.\r\nThe Story line  is simply amazing, among other animes that I've watched in my lifethis story line have opened my eyes from the first to the last episode simply because is a genuine real life situations that someone had before in x countries, and i would not be taking about the story simply because you have to see with your own eyes and experience the rage, happiness, and impotence that the show have to offer.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are quite unique because of the different paths in life they have chosen, but they walk in the same road as the others develop their skills and somewhat full fill their dreams...\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI usually don't write a reviews of anime because the setting or the emotional magnet that they might have, but the enjoyment was extreme, not because i feel all pump up, and bad-ass but because I discovered new unbelievable sh**t  that still happen in the a world were education have escalated so much. Although it  might seem great but only few countries have a system that really works in the 21st century as i said before.  WATCH IT. AND NEVER judge a book by it's cover.",

It's sad but there is also a happy feeling when you see the six friends interact with each other. It's heart breaking but they are still scenes where it's just beautiful. But one thing I can say for sure, I will cry at least once. What I also love about the story is the fact that you don't know what isgoing to happen next.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of character development in this anime but two of the six friends we didn't get to see much but that's because there will probably never be a second season. So you have to read the manga. \\n\\n\r\nThis Anime is with Death Note one of my favorites and it makes me so sad to not see the hype it really deserves. It's anime for me personally is a masterpiece and just every episode is filled with so much emotion it always left me breathless.",

            "content": "This review is going to be on the overall experience of watching Rainbow.\r\nFirst of all, I consider this anime to be on the bond of those friends above all else, and this bond is whats make this anime so amazing in my opinion.\r\nSo, as a bunch of guys who meet in their first day of \"jail\", they fight this older dude, and by doing that, and getting beaten up, they establish their friendship with him.\r\nThe more you watch, the more that bond develops, and with that, the character development is there too. They werent bad kids in the first place, but you can see howmuch work the jail does on them to \"punish\" them, and by the end of the first part, we get the story set in stone.\\n\r\nThe most amazing part of this is how the writer decided to continue the show after said first half, and that part, without spoilers, might annoy some people, but its just amazing to watch how the bond from those 6 kids is holding up and getting stronger as the story continues.\\n\r\nIts hard to say anything about this show without spoiling the main story, but here is my own view on this: I can connect with those characters on a personal level, as I myself went through a similar yet different kind of \"jail\", and there I found friends, although not as a strong bond as those in the show, but the similarity toyed with my feelings, which is for me is extremly rare.\\n\r\nAll in all, I enjoyed the anime so much I didnt notice stuff like art or sound, but I believe that both of those were done correctly, as you would expect from a seinen anime.\\n\r\nWatch this show if you love brothely bonds and cool men.\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",
