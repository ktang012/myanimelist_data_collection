            "content": "I have to admit that I first started watching Angel Beats because of two main reasons: the pretty visuals, and the presence of guitars. But once I began watching the show in earnest, I found a lot more here than I expected. Angel Beats is a show that keeps me guessing, and consistently tugs at strings I didn't know existed until they were pulled. \r\nBasically, Angel Beats is about an afterlife in which a group of dead students refuse to 'move on' to the next life, because they have some sort of peace to make with the world and themselves. There's a unique mix ofcommon school life against the supernatural. It's a setting that I found to be original enough; I also expected it to be a simple tear-jerker, but that isn't the case. \\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats has a duality about it. One part of it is comedy - most of it is well timed, and on several occasions, had me laughing out loud at my screen like a nutcase. The English-speaking, nonsensical TK doesn't even need an introduction anymore. Even the slapstick comedy is quite well done, and usually timed with unfitting music which (for the most part) heightens the comedy. \\n\\n\r\nThe other part would be the melodrama. Most of the important characters have a back story to them, which are revealed piece by piece. And, as to be expected, many are torturous, depressing tales. These stories aren't your stereotypical 'my puppy died' stories; in fact, I've found that most of the stories that have been revealed are all original in some way or another, and interesting as well. Their common theme seems to be 'regrets' - especially those of teenagers struggling with family, society and life in general. \\n\\n\r\nTopping it all off and decorating the whole package is a very clean, crisp presentation, and music that can move you from the first time you hear it. The rock concert scenes are some of the finest I've ever seen, with spectacular animation and crisp lighting effects. The music alone made me re-watch the concert episodes over and over. The art is also very pleasant on the eyes, with soft but vibrant colors and simple but effective character styles. \\n\\n\r\nThe greatest problem that many people make an issue out of is the transition between the two previously mentioned parts of comedy and drama. Sometimes, the parts can seem fragmented and poorly transitioned. But I only noticed this after I heard the criticisms and look for such inappropriateness. I'm a fan of such shows that mix in different types of enjoyment. Angel Beats also isn't a stupid show; I never felt that my emotions were being toyed with in a rudimentary or heavy handed manner. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I'm trying to say is that while this may seem contradictory and schizophrenic to some, overall, it seems to be a fairly successful blend to me. I found I actually liked being proven wrong about my guesses as to 'what kind of show this will end up being'. And I know that many scenes will evoke familiar memories from other shows, but really, this show deserves to be considered as it is, by itself. \\n\\n\r\nLet me do some breaking down: \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 7\\n\r\nThe story is revealed irregularly; some episodes teach you various things about the world, while others spend their time screwing around. I had fun watching those anyway, but I can see how others would think it's a waste of time. \\n\\n\r\nART: 9\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful. Beyond what we've come to expect, the animation is amazing (especially for the concerts), and the lighting effects give the show a slightly washed-out, surreal look - which I'm sure was the intended effect. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10\\n\r\nIt's been a while since I've liked every song in a show. Some of the BGMs are repeated a bit often, but the feature songs are all brilliant. The seiyuu also do a fine job. No voices will annoy you - unless it was intentional. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 7\\n\r\nThis one's tricky, as many of the characters' back stories are still veiled. Some characters seem to follow the usual anime tropes, but they work. I definitely felt more interested in a character once I learned more about their past. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9\\n\r\nThere's a very obvious sign as to how much I'm enjoying a show; I get antsy and check for updates every hour. The more I see, the more I want. The concert scenes alone are worth the watch. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8 \\n\\n\r\nI guess in the end, your enjoyment of Angel Beats will depend on whether its various aspects strike a chord with you or not (pardon the pun). For my part, I'm glad to have found a series that keeps me guessing, interests me with its premise, dazzles my eyes, while making me laugh and sniffle in the same episode. \\n\\n\r\nThis one's definitely worth your attention, at least until you're absolutely sure you don't like everything about it. Check it out. \\n\\n\r\nPOST SCRIPT: \\n\r\nAfter having finished this series, I needed to add a short addendum - because it helped me realize the potential problem of this series. In short, it's a little messy. If you watch the final episode, you'll probably come to realize the main theme of the series (the entire first half of the final episode is dedicated to it). But when you do, you start thinking of ways in which certain story elements could have been developed and presented a little better. \\n\\n\r\nI can't help but compare it to Clannad, a series that expertly manages the drama and the waves of emotion from the viewer. It's almost like the show is psychic, and knows exactly when to say or show something in order to get the maximum emotional impact and reaction. Compared to that, Angel Beats is more than a little awkward; in particular, the final scene - it just didn't hit me as hard as I thought it should. I was affected, but was distracted at the same time by the clumsy dialogue and the sense of too many unexplained factors. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I'm very glad I spent time with Angel Beats, and will surely miss its presence. At the same time, it pains me to think of how much better it could have been if the show didn't feel so rushed, and if the writers had put a bit more planning and effort into the final moments.",

            "content": "Sometimes anime studios manage to confuse me, not because of anything they do, but because of what they don't do.\r\nTake Angel Beats as an example.\r\nAny fan of certain Key visual novels (or their KyoAni adaptations), will undoubtedly be familiar with the work of Maeda Jun, whose inimitable style, approach, and methodology to storytelling is clearly on display in Angel Beats, and on the surface this may actually seem like a good thing. Given the whole concept of a high school purgatory one would think there was enormous scope for the tale, and in some aspects the story is delivered very well. The only problem isthat as a viewer, I'm kind of getting bored of watching the same thing over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nHere's what I mean. Angel Beats takes the idea of purgatory (to those of you who don't know that word, google it), and places it firmly in a high school setting, something which is familiar territory to Maeda, and while the plot actually works fairly well within that setting, there isn't actually anything that I found inspiring or moving in any way. In addition to this the whole basis of the story is that this particular purgatory is only for young people, however one has to question why this is so, and also why the only young people who get to go there are all people with regrets.\\n\\n\r\nConfused? Throughout the whole series not one character actually displayed any kind of violent or vengeful behaviour in their past life, and this omission place a huge bias on the story. As far as I'm aware, the nature of purgatory is that it exists not only for those with regrets, but also for those whose sins aren't great enough for them to be sent to hell.\\n\\n\r\nPurgatory is, in effect, the last chance a soul has to \"get it right\", and whilst Angel Beats does kind of show this, the lack of anyone who died for revenge makes the whole story unbalanced. The fact that almost everyone in the story only has regret makes the whole show a bit too sugary sweet, and while the whole series is actually pretty well written, this only makes the areas that are missing  more pronounced.\\n\\n\r\nStill, the plot is paced nicely, and the idea is definitely unusual for a high school series. There's also the inclusion of certain elements that are interesting, but the show never really puts them to good use until near the end of the series and at that point it just seems too little, too late.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to another area of confusion, the art and animation throughout the show is actually pretty decent on the whole. The characters are designed nicely and have a certain look about them that really does remind one of KyoAni's work with Key. The backgrounds and scenery are pretty normal (the high school setting doesn't really allow for much in the way of creativity), and don't really set themselves apart from other shows of this ilk.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is actually the concert scenes. The whole series is designed and animated in a certain style which at first seems pretty decent. Then P.A. Works make concert scenes that not only look better, but have more fluid and detailed animation, are better choreographed, and are just plain superior to the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nWhy not do the whole show in this way? It's as if P.A. Works are telling the viewer \"this is what we're really capable of, but we're not going to give it to you so you'll have to make do with the leftovers\". If the whole series was animated in the same manner as the concert scenes then this would easily be one of the best looking shows in anime, and the fact that the viewer can clearly see that P.A. Works are capable of much greater things is more than a little annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, while Angel Beats looks decent where it could have been great, it sounds so much better than one might expect. Given the high school setting there's a wealth of character types on display, including the voices. The acting is pretty decent throughout, but there's very little for the seiyuu to work with as the characters are pretty much one dimensional (more on this in a bit).\\n\\n\r\nWhat really steals the show though, is the music. Yes, there are very well produced concert scenes, but the music that's actually used throughout the series is pretty good too. Surprisingly, Maeda is also the composer for Angel Beats, while the actual arrangement of the thematic pieces is done by Anant-Garde Eyes. As for the title tracks the OP, \"My Soul, Your Beats\", is a decent enough pop song, while the ED, \"Brave Story\", is a rather nice ballad.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the characters go, it's here where Angel Beats begins to suffer from the inherent lack of creativity. While there are some nice ideas and concepts in the show, the fact that Maeda and director Kishi Seiji have opted for the stereotype leaves a lot to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say that the characters are bad per se, no, it simply means that they are very much as one would expect, right down to their personalities. Yuri, for example, reminded me of a certain leader from a particularly famous KyoAni franchise. While the similarities between characters from Angel Beats and other shows may sometimes be only skin deep, the fact that no thought was given to trying out something new, especially with the more interesting ideas that the show toyed with, makes one think that the business side of the industry has taken over, at least where this show is concerned.\\n\\n\r\nNow while I've been fairly critical about Angel Beats, that doesn't mean to say that the series is bad, or that I didn't enjoy it. The fact is that this show has something to offer to many people, and while I may not be a hardcore fan of this anime, or hate it with a passion, I can honestly see why those perspective are valid. The simple fact is that Angel Beats truly did have the potential to be something special in anime, and that has been wasted in favour of producing something that will appeal to the existing moe fan base.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, the whole industry needs to make money (and what better way than to milk it from fans who don't know any better by giving them more of the same), but it would be nice if, just for once, one of these creators would actually give us the series that they truly want us to see.\\n\\n\r\nThen again, that's probably nothing more than a pipe dream.",

            "content": "Angel Beats!, an anime hailed by many to be one of the best, if not the best anime ever, but also an anime many think its bad and seriously overrated. So where does it stand? Well, it isn't downright terrible, but it's not the best anime there is either, no, it's not even close to it. \r\nI think the main story is summarized pretty nicely on MAL so I won't go in much depth on that. The first few episodes were presented nicely, and definitely looked promising. It introduced you to the characters in the SSS and Tenshi, and for me, I think they dida good job on it, making you want to know the truth of the afterlife and how the characters ended up there. From there, however, it started to fall apart, bit by bit.\\n\r\nYou see, when an anime is only going to be 13 episodes long, it can have the tendency to get rushed a lot. And when an anime gets rushed, it can usually leave no room for development on both story and characters, sometimes cramming a huge amount of plot in one episode to even make it feel confusing. That's exactly what happened with Angel Beats!. The short duration of the series was at fault when the characters couldn't even get a proper development and backstory and mostly because of that, the story, on the whole, fell short. The huge amount of comic relief (at times, unneeded) didn't help much either. Honestly, they could surely have sacrificed some of the rather drawn-out comical scenes for some backstory right? Well, they obviously thought showing like only 6 backstory (out of like 18+ SSS characters) was ok enough, otherwise they could have shown at least one or two more even in just 13 episodes.\\n\r\n     Also for the ending... well it's loved by a lot of people and disliked by others. As for me, I was very disappointed by it. The romance buildup towards the ending only had a few episodes to go for, and was rushed and just crammed together in the last few episodes, having almost no development whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is a standout. It was just stunning, beautiful and eye-catching. The character and background designs were, overall, great. The animation was also great. It was crisp and fluid, and everything from character movements to the little bits of battle scenes we had were animated very well.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the Sound aspect, which I easily thought was the 2 of the best parts of the show, the other being the Art. The OP/ED were great but the soundtracks were really memorable to me. They fit the scenes very well, especially the beautiful and sad soundtracks. To me, without the soundtracks, some scenes wouldn't have felt the same way as it did.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters. What started out as so promising ended up, not terribly, but marred by the short duration of the series. As I have said before, the character development was practically non-existent due to the series being short. The characters themselves, are interesting, but not entirely unique. Likable? yes, Lovable? maybe.\\n\r\nAs I have mentioned before, I was really looking forward to seeing the character's past and how they got to the afterlife. However, with just 13 episodes, even if the character's past is cut short, it just seems so hard to fit all 18 members of the SSS + Kanade in the series. That led to having only about 6 character's backstory shown. This also led to the more interesting characters being overlooked. Characters like T.K., Shiina, or Noda had so much potential to become a great character, but were basically brushed off to the side. \\n\r\nHere's what I hear a lot from people who have completed the series. Many of them say that they didn't cry or feel sad throughout the series simply because that they couldn't get attached to the characters in such short amount of time. \\n\r\nThis, for the most parts, is true, but also depends on the person watching it. For me, I liked some of the characters, and found myself partly relating to some, (who had a backstory that is) but I didn't get attached to them. But like I said, this just depends on the person watching the series. Some could cry and feel sad for days, but others could just shrug it off and say \"meh\".  \\n\r\nSo will you be attached to the characters by the end of the series? It depends. Had the series went on just a bit longer to give characters some more time, most, if not all characters in SSS would probably have gotten a proper development and backstory, and also likely would have made you feel more attached to them. \\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed Angel Beats! despite its flaws. Although most of the enjoyment score comes from the first couple of episodes, the last couple still weren't downright terrible, it was just too rushed to the point it became uninteresting. In my opinion, the comedy was decent but it was just too drawn-out. For the sad scenes, I personally found only one scene to be sad, I didn't cry, but it was still, sad. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Angel Beats! is a good anime with some outstanding aspects to it, accompanied by departments where it could have been executed a LOT better. A longer duration could have helped a lot for Angel Beats! as it could have had more developed story and characters, but what's done is done.\\n\r\nI'd say Angel Beats! is on the overrated side, but being overrated doesn't mean that you shouldn't watch it. Who knows? For you Angel Beats could be a fun, sad, and enjoyable experience as a whole.",

            "content": "Angel Beats! The anime that is praised by many and criticized by few. Sadly I was forced to go stand in the cold critic corner. In all honesty, I was excited to watch this anime after all the suggestions from people and raving reviews. The art looked amazing and I heard the music was incredible. What is a good anime in my book? An anime that effects my grades negatively, because just...one...more...episode! Angel Beats however never gripped me. It made me say: \"Ok that's enough for today, I have a ton of homework anyway...\" My experience can be best summed up in a quote fromanother review: \"I badly wanted to love this anime, but just couldn't...\" \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI obsessively try to spot the cracks and flaws in a plot, but I overlook a lot of flaws in the beginning of an anime to give it a fair chance. From the start the plot's foundation was already showing cracks, but I ignored them due to my high hopes for this \"MUST WATCH!\" The story begins with our main protagonist waking up in some kind of \"afterlife\" and he is greeted by a teenage girl with a sniper rifle. The apparent \"antagonist\" called Angel is, like everyone in this \"afterlife\", immortal, but she has extra powers (cause why settle for immortality, am I right?) The leader of the \"resistance\" is perfectly aware of their opponent\u2019s immortality but she and her group of rebels shoot at her anyway (with guns made from dirt by the way...), even though one of her powers allows bullets to pass straight through her. I was just waiting for one rebel to shout: \"Our bullets have been passing harmlessly through her for the past 5 minutes, sir!\" Then the leader would answer: \"Just shoot harder!!\" I would be crying on the floor! (Not tears of laughter but tears of pain cause I would have fell off my chair laughing!) \\n\\n\r\nThis \"Pre-afterlife\" world is a highschool  (cause every anime needs a bunch of not-so-normal teens that go to high school.) At this school you are given a chance to make peace with your tragic life and move on to your reincarnation. One of the ways to pass on? Get good grades... So this group of rebels against God decide to go to class but not pay any attention...brilliant! Why even go to class in the first place? Another thing that irritated me is they added filler scenes and 3 or 4 filler episodes to a 13 episode anime! The characters and plot never had a chance to develop in that short time because it was given 2nd or sometimes 3rd priority! If you take off your thinking cap, lend it to a friend, sit down and just immerse yourself in the art, music, action and comedy then you might enjoy this anime quite a bit. The plot is also very slow paced and when it finally picks up the pace the anime is almost over, everything is rushed and you end up with a horde of mini-arcs.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nSchool scenario, group of misfits, each an embodiment of some stereotype, it's been done too many times... Let\u2019s start with a positive. This anime had some of the most interesting characters I've seen in a while. I needed to know more and when I realized that they will be telling each character's backstory and revealing the reason for them \"qualifying\" for this school I was ecstatic! There was hope for this anime! Sadly the 3 most interesting/mysterious characters were not even developed the slightest! Their backstories were not even told! You had the chilled guy who never stopped dancing and only spoke small snippets of vague English. You had the introvert girl who was always on her own and who had a love for puppies and the weapon obsessed, hot tempered guy who had a crush on one of the main female protagonists. These 3 supporting characters in my opinion had the most potential. All 3 pushed aside and only used for comic relief... The waste of potential was shocking and really got to me.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNow I need to agree with almost every review here and admit, the art was amazing. The use of rays of light reflecting off objects and the creamy colours were very soothing to the eye. Beautiful backgrounds and scenes complemented the scenarios and were not too busy. The characters had simple, but original designs. (At least most of them...) Even though they were pointless, the action scenes were smooth and flowed. The art was one of the aspects that slightly redeemed this anime and that acted as a safety net to slow it's steady decent down my anime list.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music matched the scenes and really added atmosphere and added emotion to the scenes that were \"meant\" to touch you. (It was incredibly easy to see the formula that the writer followed to try and tug at my heart strings.) One track in particular that played during the last episode in the saddest moment made a smile briefly creep onto my disappointed face.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the art and sound, but those are just enhancers of the story. Sadly great art and sound could never save a wrecked plot, no matter how good. It did cushion the blow however.\\n\\n\r\nENDING 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime's last chance to grab a point or two from me. Sadly even this chance was squandered... I started watching this anime with the hope of sharing the same feels as all the fans of this anime begging me to give it a chance. The ending lacked any emotional impact though... I could almost see the writer add every typical element to the ending to make it resemble a genuinely sad yet still realistic ending.   I unfortunately found the ending devoid of even a scrap of logic and even the timeline of past events shown to the viewer via flashbacks made no sense...(I don't want to spoil anything) But without spoiling I just need to say that the ending makes all the efforts and motives of the \"resistance\" redundant and laughable... Even their reincarnation theory or should I say fear of not wanting to risk coming back as a barnacle is totally blown out of the water...(No pun intended) \\n\\n\r\nNow there is one thing about the end that I need to address, so please skip the next well designated paragraph but NOT the rest of the review if you want to avoid a slight spoiler. You gone? Good :) Don't say I didn't warn you...\\n\\n\r\n***BEGINNING OF SPOILER***\\n\\n\r\nAt the very end the main character and Kanade (Angel) move on and are reincarnated as humans that look almost exactly like their former selves, that are also conveniently the same age and live in the same town/city and Angel is conveniently humming a song from the afterlife so that reincarnated Otanashi (Main character) can recognise the tune and they end up meeting again... Out of all the BILLIONS of lifeforms they could have been reincarnated as...or lets just say for arguments sake that humans can only be reincarnated as humans the odds are still impossible! That is complete and utter bullshit and terrible writing! Haha\\n\\n\r\n***END OF SPOILER***\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 3 + OVERALL: 4\\n\\n\r\nI know saying that you did not like Angel Beats! is like saying you prefer Dub over Sub in the anime community, but I'll carry that burden ;) The art and music were fantastic and the comedy made me laugh, but I struggled to take the anime seriously.  I never knew if they wanted to make things seem realistic or not. If you are going to make an anime take place in the afterlife, might as well throw realism out of the window rather than to try and fix the many problems that come with anime of this genre. Summed up: A group of teens that go to highschool in the afterlife while rebelling against an unknown/unseen/faceless God and shooting an immortal enemy with bullets and guns made from dirt... Immortal teens afraid to die in a world where death means a trip to the school nurse... Some characters did not even have particularly sad stories. One failed to catch a baseball for f* sake... The school is \"designed\" to help souls who had tragic lives accept their fate and move on, right? But why are there no new arrivals throughout the anime? If you take the population of the earth into perspective, then there would be a massive influx of new arrivals at the school daily due to our world being the chaotic mess that it is. There has to be people/teens who live tragic lives 100 times worse than the characters of this anime, but why don't we see them arrive at the \"school\"? \\n\\n\r\nI know this review was horribly critical of Angel Beats!, but I had no choice. Angel Beats! is a rotten egg that has been beautifully painted (Art) and coated in perfume (Sound)\\n",

            "content": "\"-You must be an idiot! You should try dying once!\r\nby the way, that's a clich\u00e9 joke in this world where no one can die. So, was it funny?\"\r\nI'm at a loss for words...\r\nWhat could I say? I keep getting surprised with Key's scriptwriters. Who's already familiar with their works, probably heard the name Jun Maeda before. He's the original creator of Angel Beats. You may not like him, but Maeda's (and his coworkers at Key) manner of creating and conducing a story, be it a light-hearted comedy or a melodramatic romance, is definately worthy of praise. Just look around, Clannad, Air, Kanon and recently LittleBusters! are all well-known series.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you see the description and the pictures for this anime, you actually think there's nothing of \"special\" with it. Guns, girls, music, baseball, god, angels... awesome! But can it all fit together? After a long sequence of Key's emotional stories, I wasn't willing to watch this (aparently) easygoing story with \"afterlife\" or \"purgatory\" theme. There's just too much of it nowadays that it's getting boring.\\n\r\nFortunately I gave it a try and watched the first episode... \\n\r\nSometimes you find these series with a kick off episode so amazing that throws away all your worries and uncertainties. Starting straight with the OP song, without a preview cutscene, you're introduced to the characters and just a few minutes after it, the story starts to develop. Fast paced like this, the viewers, just like the male protagonist are thrown in this \"afterlife world\" where those who doesn't want to disapear, or reincarnate as a caterpillar, must fight against god.\\n\r\nI've read a few reviews with really low scores for AngelBeats, the main reason being the \"lack of originality\" regarding it's story. Let's be fair, the anime industry has been producing series for more then 40 years, it's reasonable to think that some themes would be repeated. However, a recurrent theme doesn't mean the new releases will all be clich\u00e9 or repetitive, what's important is the way the theme is approached and the individual elements each anime adds to it. That being said, I consider AngelBeats an \"original\" anime, even tough the basis of its story is not new, the characters, scenario, art and the development of the plot itself, makes it unique.\\n\r\nThis series has that kind of sadistic/dark humor that you can't deny, it is funny, but without all that gore you would usually see in a show with this theme. It's tagged as \"Supernatural\" here in MAL, but it's the \"family\" kind of anime, that you can watch whenever you want. You won't experience those awkward moments where someone who isn't aware of what's going on see the screen in a not-very-correct moment. (Also the amount of fanservice in AngelBeats is minimal.) With \"death\" being part of the story it's certain that there would be violence in it, but it's in a level that isn't disturbing. In the end, you could call it a \"slice-of-afterlife\", since it has all the elements an generic slice-of-life just with a unusual setting.\\n\r\nFor those who aren't familiarized with Maeda's animes yet, it's nice to point out that they're all full of symbolism, and this one isn't an exception. You always have two perspectives and some things are left in the open for you, the viewer, to make your own interpretation.\\n\r\nThat's why I'd always recommend the subbed version. No offense to the dubbers, they're great. But while watching it in japanese you'll always get more from the dialogue and furthermore somethings become easier to understand.\\n\r\nThe plot had some lose ends indeed, but I wouldn't call them \"flaws\". Considering it's just 13 episodes long, Key and P.A.Works did a marvelous work with it, if you watch it open minded without paying too much attention to the script you won't find a problem with it at all.\\n\\n\r\nOne common issue with series where there are too many characters like AngelBeats does is that you get lost within.\\n\r\nIt becomes confusing to tell who did what, whose name is that, etc. This is something you won't experience with this anime. The characters -I mean, the PEOPLE- of it, each one of them have it's personality well written and it's own importance in the story (be it a main or supportive character) they all had a carefully written background story that does make you feel like you're watching real people with real problems even when it's something unrealistic as being dead.\\n\r\nShiina and Yui, for example, are both supportive characters, but they're important in the plot just like the protagonists, also their mottos and catchy phrases \"how unwise\"/\"what an idiot\" adds that \"spice\", that extra thing, that were missing to take a laugh out of you at certain scenes. They're not just laying there with the sole purpose of being a side-kick for the main characters. \\n\r\nHow often do you see it? A drama anime that manages to keep its direction and focus in the protagonists but still take care of the supportive characters' problems and happy moments?\\n\\n\r\nThere's just one opening theme for the 13 episodes. However, there are small differences in it from one episode to another. Remember when I mentioned the symbolism on Maeda's stories? The OP isn't an exception. The piano, the lights and the way the characters are presented, there's a reason for it all. When you realize it, you start to see it with different eyes and that opening that would be boring to watch becomes interesting. The same applies for the ending theme. The animation of it changes according to the story and in a couple of episodes it's a different song. This is a interesting thing to point out, there're some studios that completely fails to make an emotional ending because after the heartbreaking scene they throw the usual ending theme, a 100%-effective mood killer. In Angel Beats thankfully this doesn't happen and the songs choosen for these couple of endings are wonderful. \\n\r\nThe background soundtrack made for it is nice. It's none masterpiece but fits well with the scenes. If I were to give prise for something of it, would be the sound effects. They used some really nice ones, from horror movies hollywood-style played with classical instruments to new ones made with synthetizers. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is nice, atractive and well drawn, but I'd like to open a paragraph here, if I may, for a special topic that isn't covered in the main score neither in the \"art\" section. It would be for the transitions and visual effects of the anime. This would be all those text boxes saying \"in the next day\" but also light and angle effects. These are subjects the animators took great care of. All the transitions from one scene to another had, how could I say, \"style\". Every time the scenario changed, there would be a tag in the corner with the place's name. It becomes even a visual joke in the anime when the characters goes through several places endlessly. The same for facial expressions, you can sense someone put effort on drawing it. From laughing scenes to dramatic ones, they seemed always convincing. \\n\\n\r\nIf I were to write a \"Trivia\" section in this review, it would become too long for it to be read. I'll just say you'll get some really nice laughing moments with some practical jokes, references they make and definately, character quotes. Specially T.K's ones (the english-speaking guy). Pay attention and you may even find \"easter eggs\" of other Key projects such as Clannad and Air.\\n\r\nI had so much fun with this anime but still I was moved with the emotional scenes. The deeper the story was developing, I was still laughing with the characters but also feeling bad for them. This combination is what makes Angel Beats a masterpiece for me. It's not too dramatic but also not a easygoing comedy, just the exact average between them that I came to love. A beautiful story about life and people.\\n\r\nAngel Beats is a \"compact\" anime with a clear ending. That's why I don't have hope for the 2nd season, however if it happens to appear someday I will be looking foward to it. \\n\r\nAs a final consideration for this review, I'd like to give a advice: Don't watch the special \"Another Epilogue\" right after you finish the main series. Take your time, relax your brain. Otherwise you'll go crazy on theories and alternative endings. Watch it open-minded, without the \"oh, this is so clich\u00e9\" kind of thought, and you'll have a great time with it. Enjoyment-o'-meter: 100%.\\n\r\nNumeric score: Story:9/10 | Art:10/10 | Sound:9/10 | Character:9/10 | Enjoyment:10/10 | Overall:9,8...just give it a 10 already.\\n\\n\r\nUhn... I ended up writing a lot. If you read everything, my huge thanks :D\\n\r\nGoodbye Wild Heaven~",

            "content": "Angel Beats has convinced me that Jun Maeda doesn\u2019t know how to write an original story. His previous hits Air, Kanon, and Clannad have been about a bunch of mentally and/or physically broken high school girls who all fall in love with a guy whose only significant character trait is that he exists, and along the way one of these girls will die of a mysterious illness. For Angel Beats, Maeda twists his tried and true formula by having all the characters dead to begin with, and stuck in some sort of high school purgatory, where a group of high school students shoot a littlegirl in the kneecaps for no good reason.\\n\\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Maeda\u2019s stories are very formulaic. First, he establishes a cast of one dimensional, but likeable characters, and a zero dimensional main character who is designed to be a self insert for the viewer. He then lulls the viewers into a false sense of security with a couple of comedic episodes before dropping a tragedy bomb. In time the main character recovers from the tragedy and an asspull miracle occurs, to ensure a happy ending and negating any kind of character development. Angel Beats follows this same formula to an extent, however due to last minute budget cuts; this had to be crammed into 13 episodes making the production feel rushed and uneven. \\n\\n\nA lot of fans will defend the show by saying that it would have been more coherent had it been given 26 episodes. I don\u2019t buy this. Maeda had a lot of options. He could have told half the story and left it open to a probable second season. He could have cut some of the characters or spend less time recycling the same gags (suicide rushes, rocket chairs, etc.) to make more room for character growth. It\u2019s possible to tell a great story in 13 episodes or less. Haibane Renmei told a similar purgatory story in 13 episodes, and the world was much deeper, and the characters more sympathetic. Baccano had a huge cast, yet all the characters got their time to shine, without taking away from the story. \\n\\n\nIn addition, there is never a really good explanation for why they\u2019re fighting Tenshi. They make her out to be evil incarnate at first, but quickly find out that she\u2019s actually a normal girl. Yet rather than do their research, Yuri somehow convinced everyone to build an underground factory, stockpile weapons, and hold rock concerts just to fuck with everyone\u2019s dinner time. If you stop to think about it, the war on Tenshi was nothing more than pointless bickering started by a petulant bitch. Using the budget cuts to defend the trainwreck of a story is like when high school student complain that they would have done better on a test had they gotten more time. Sometimes, you just have to admit that you didn\u2019t know what you were doing.\\n\\n\nWhile the music for the show was decent, part of me felt it was a ploy to milk more money out of the show. Some of the early episodes focused on a band called Girls Dead Monster who played music as some sort of distraction. However, because they weren\u2019t central to the plot, and because singles were being released so frequently while the show was airing, it all felt like a cheap cash-in to ride the wave of success of K-ON.\\n\\n\nSo if I hated the story so much, why did I stick with it? Simply, it\u2019s because I\u2019m a big fan of the director, Seiji Kishi. He previously did Seto no Hanayome and Tentai Senshi Sunred, which are two of my favorite comedy series. I could see that a lot of effort went into the animation. The lighting and movement was dynamic and smooth. The backgrounds were nicely detailed and had a pleasing color palette. Unfortunately, none of this could save the production from its terrible story. Part of me feels the director was overcompensating for the terrible story by blinding the audience with pretty pictures. This seems to have worked on a large portion of the fanbase since a lot of reviews I have read comment on how pretty it is while glossing over the failure of the story.\\n\\n\nAfter watching Angel Beats and seeing the audience reaction to it online, I feel like it\u2019s done its job of manipulating its audience with false emotions. It\u2019s a formula that has worked for previous Key works, and their sales of figures and dakimakura prove it. Fans of the show that actually finished this review rather than marking it \u201cunhelpful\u201d and moving on, watch the show again. Is it actually unique, or is it the same trite, repetitive crap that\u2019s been plaguing the anime industry for years? Does the story make sense, or is it full of more holes than a cheese grater? But most importantly, is it actually good or are you still lying to yourself?\\n",

            "content": "Angel Beats! is absolutely glorious and perfect. It made me laugh, and cry, and I just loved all the drama and the story is not as paper-thin as one would believe. I thought all the characters were awesome, especially TK xD. The ending made me cry it was so good. In summary, Angel Beats! is amazing and is really emotional and if you haven't seen Angel Beats! go watch it!\r\nHaha just kidding. Angel Beats! isn't actually all that special, and I'm writing this review to just try and send out a message to those of you who have not watched Angel Beats! yet. No I'mnot trolling, I really hated Angel Beats! and the reason I stuck with it to the end is so I could tell other anime watchers to stay the hell away from it. Note: I don't give a shit about the 'moewave.' I like all genres and types of anime, and if an anime is enjoyable or presents a very powerful story (or both, god forbid!) I'd like to tell you about it. It's just frustrating when I see a review (on this anime especially) and the reviewer goes out of his way to say \"I'm going to ignore story and characters because those aren't important.\" That kind of thing makes me flip shit. It's as if I were to sell you a fancy house, but tell you you couldn't go inside. Is that fair? Hell no! Then here, my review on Angel Beats!, and I promise I won't say anything like \"X isn't important\" and waste your time doing so.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nOtonashi, our walking cliche protagonist as another reviewer pointed out, has lost his memories and wakes up in a new world where he realizes people can't die. There he meets several exciting and interesting one-dimensional characters. Yurippe, the leader (who looks suspiciously close to another KyoAni mascot character) is the loudmouth leader of a fighting squadron that wants to \"rebel against god.\" The only thing Yurippe can think to do to \"rebel against god\" is to pick on the class president, who is a frail lolita character and to repeatedly shoot her until she is dead (in a world where people can't die... fascinating how KyoAni got away with this). Then entire episodes are dedicated through traversing a 'dangerous underground path' full of 'dangerous traps.' Then we learn that the guns Yurippe gets are made out of dirt (no explanation). Then a whole lot of sobstories come into play. Almost every episode a character reveals their \"troubled and emotional\" past, and the pacing that introduces it is horrendous and each background story takes around half an episode to go through. \\n\\n\r\nBlatantly, I didn't find the comedy all that funny, seeing as it was just rip offs of other Maeda Jun works, oh and so were the back stories. One of the girls falls into a coma and it is even alluded to AIR.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing as this was anime had so many random filler episodes and insert songs it's hard to really explain the story. Or maybe it's hard to explain because there wasn't one (or if there was it was dastardly weak).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nAside from the numerous background errors per episode where the background changed sizes and the costuming errors (WILL BE FIXED IN THE BLU-RAYS HERPDERP), the animation was really good. Yes, I hated this anime, but I'm not going to lie, the animation was amazing. Bullets bounced off things realistically, and everything was really fluid. There was even water used in the last episode that looked so real that it utterly shocked me. \\n\\n\r\nNow the character design pissed the hell out of me. The main character looks no more original than any third-rate anime. He's a normal build, with a normal haircut, and a normal voice and manner of speech etcetc. Then Yurippe was obviously just a Haruhi rip-off. Try and prove me wrong. What? You can't? Just put a picture of the two next to each other and you'll see. Then comes the art. I really had no opinion but I was leaning toward dislike on it. It looked like a blocky version Haruhi, and all the characters looked like tetris blocks when standing still, they all had this square build for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe opening is awesome. A nice piano piece with Lia as the singer. The ending is okay, I didn't feel much for it, but music is a taste and this part of the review is very opinion oriented.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was also really good. The characters (as bad as they were) had voices that brought out what the creators were trying to do. Ototnashi had a normal voice, Kanade (Tenshi or Angel) had a monotone voice. Etc. To be honest I didn't really know a lot of the seiyuu other than Hiroshi Kiyama and Kana Hanazawa (Araragi and Nadeko respectively, both from Bakemonogatari) but I didn't really care - they did good work.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nEvery character is a cardboard cut out and can be reduced to one word. There's the bland protagonist, the bossy Yurippe, the 'kuudere' (cool) Kanade, a bodybuilder, an egomaniac, a spaz, a dunce, a brute, a fatty, a ninja, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there was TK.\\n\\n\r\nTK is the single most creative piece of work in this entire anime. 90% of his lines consist of broken engirsh and usually make no sense. BUT I'M OKAY WITH THAT! Why? BECAUSE IT'S CREATIVE. There is very very few pieces of creativity in this anime, very very few things that don't follow an archetypal story. KyoAni took a chance and put in something that might be DIFFERENT (oh god what is this) and it simply worked. TK is a funny character and does headspins for no reason and has no background at all. But who cares? He was more developed and more interesting than ANY OTHER CHARACTER. This whole section got a plus one - just for TK.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nI'm sorry. I couldn't do it. I couldn't bring myself to like it, and I know a lot of people who write reviews saying that \"they wanted to like it, they really did\" - and hey same here. The day this anime aired I was so freaking excited. I was ready to call this the anime of the year and I told all my friends to watch it. By episode three I couldn't take it anymore and I absolutely hated it, but I pushed on. I tried to enjoy the next episode. I sat down with my favorite candy (the Hot Tamales) and got myself my favorite drink (a delicious Seltzer) and made sure I watched it when no one would interrupt me. Shit it was hell. Every week. I tried harder and harder and then I realized.\\n\\n\r\nWhy am I forcing myself to like this anime, which is pretty mediocre?\\n\\n\r\nAnd there you have it folks. That's all it is. Mediocre. The visuals can be the greatest on the planet, but that's not going to make me fond of the characters, or become interested in the plot. It's like Avatar by James Cameron, you love it or hate it, and if you love it, you don't love it for the characters, you love it for the explosions and all the pretty doodads and doohickeys involved.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4.8/10\\n\r\nI just averaged the numbers. That's the number I think this show properly deserves. Hey! You may still want to watch this anime. If you do, don't go in expecting too much. If you're able to looks past this anime's flaws in story and character then maybe you're experience will be much different, but if you're bothered by this, I strongly advise against watching this anime. It is not like Haruhi, it is not like CLANNAD, it is not like Kanon, but sure is a blend of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters refer to themselves as \"idiots.\" And holy crap that is one good definition, but please beware viewer, let me warn you, if you consume idiocy, you become an idiot.",

            "content": "OVERALL (4) I really don't understand how this show is so highly rated. This is absolutely no the show for you if you enjoy story, good characterization, comprehensible motivations, or a coherent setting. Other than the admittedly stunning visuals, the show has very little to offer compared to other media that are far superior in almost every other aspect. To nutshell: amazing animation that guilds an empty shell of a series with so little substance it may as well be filler from start to finish. Actually I take that back, filler from start to finish would actually be more entertaining.\r\nSTORY AND ENJOYMENT (2) I bundlesince I am watching this to have a story played out for me by a set of good characters. This is where I derive my enjoyment. But, the show so heavily under-emphasizes everything about the story that if just a little bit more time were spent on it, clearly fleshing out the world and spending more time exploring it I may have been more forgiving of the other failures such as lack of clear purpose to any of the characters actions, why certain characters exist in the world and can do the things they do (especially with reference to the guild), and what the twitbugger is going on? Maybe I'm being too harsh on this show. There were a handful of moments that were indeed funny and some that plucked at my heart strings like a confused infant first that first learned how to move its hands but it was all so token and felt like one writers half baked idea formed at the end of a storyboard meeting thinking, \"Oh, what if we blow up this character!? It'll be funny! And what if the snarky character does the snarky thing and the wildcard character does something completely random? Lets all get drunk to write that last one cuz it'll be great!\" The most engaging part of the plot were when there was almost none at all and the writers knew this so the story ended up dangerously anemic.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, my biggest grievance with the show was how badly it handled what little plot there was. Without spoiling anything, the ending was so bad you could have served it with some snails and called it french cuisine; it was stale, moldy, utterly perplexing, and smelled faintly of flatulence. \\n\\n\r\nBut lets look at the good parts of the show, because nothing can be all bad. \\n\r\nANIMATION (9) as I've said, the animation is simply superb. It is some of the best animation for a series I've ever seen, and I would argue, almost on par with something like Kara no Kyoukai. Its like visual crack. If you can stand the moe aspects of the show, the character design is varied (for the most part) and each character is visually distinct reflecting the personality of the character fairly well. \\n\r\nThis leads me into the CHARACTERS (3). All of them, with the exception of the MC and one other, are basically one dimensional and can be summed up in a single sentence. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. Like I said before, the show does a good job of using the characters and their unidimensionality as a means of entertainment, but its all very same-y. No risks are taken on the part of the writers to try and develop most of these characters and the one character that was incredibly well fleshed out is put on a bus before even halfway through the season (yes my favorite was the one in the band). The entertainment from this show through its characters is very popcorn-y and safe but at least its still entertaining. But like a good drunk piss, all I really care about is the arc, which few of the characters seem to satisfy, and to me that is disappointing.\\n\r\nSOUND (7)  is another area where the show does pretty okay in. I wouldn't say that any of the tracks really blew my mind, but they were all very well suited for the situation and, as stand alone music, were tolerable to listen to. Most of the tracks are some combination of synth and non-synth strings, piano, and an electronica drum-kit. I will make a special mention of one track, Angel's Flight, which really is just a delight to listen to. Overall a lot of effort was put into the sound track and it shows.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\r\nI think this is best closed by going back to my nutshell, especially since the show metaphorically resembles one. An outer solid shell of good sound and animation which crumbles easily to reveal a decaying seed of story and characters.",

While a lot of people don't share my sentiment, and say that Angel Beats! is nothing special, I disagree.\r\nAngel Beats! takes place in a kind of afterlife similar to purgatory. In it, young adults find themselves at a mysterious colossal boarding school that runs like most other schools...with one exception; Yuri and the Afterlife battlefront.\r\nThe members of the Afterlife battlefront fight the unfairness of life and also their idealogy of god. Otonashi is the protagonist, after he wakes in the new world with little to no memories about his past life. This mayseem cliche, well, because it somewhat is but this works well as a plot device as his motives change because of his memories being slowly regained. \\n\\n\r\nAfter a long break from Anime this was the series that drew me back in. The mix of action and light-hearted comedy has it's subtle mesh and the Anime is brought together by some truly stirring musical pieces. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters of Otonashi and Yuri work well and the supporting characters are developed in a way that neither wastes time nor feels that they are felt 2D dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it is well worth watching. It comes bundled in a short and sweet 13 episode set and leaves you fulfilled.",

            "content": "This is my first review so I hope it helps! \r\nIf you haven't read the synopsis, Angel Beats (in a nutshell) takes place in a fictional world at a school where the protagonists are unable to advance to the afterlife/next life because of regret or lack of fulfillment in their previous life. There were lots of ups and downs to this series. I was really excited to start the series since it had been so heavily recommended to me by several friends, so I had high expectations prior to watching Angel Beats. Whether or not this affected my opinion is difficult to say, but Ifound myself disappointed and unmoved by the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I break the series down into categories, I'll say what stands out in this anime. The visuals and audio are captivating. They really compliment the characters and story. Out of all the anime I've seen, I'd place Angel Beats in the top 5 for visuals and the very top for audio. The topic of the afterlife is nothing new. The overall idea of Angel Beats is somewhat identical to Haibane Renmei (protagonists stuck in life after death, forgotten pasts, regret, friendship, pass to next life, happy times), but it is presented more uniquely than any anime of the same genre that I have seen. \\n\\n\r\nA show of such promise is subject to heavy criticism if that promise is not upheld and that was the case for me. I'll explain it in categories.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nI was really impressed with the first few episodes. They achieved the goal of getting me hooked to the story wanting to unravel the mystery of this world between the past and future as well as why and how the protagonists ended up there. The premise of the show wasn't beaming in uniqueness, but it was presented and built up in a very promising way. A little over halfway through the series is when I felt that the story started to fall apart. The closer I got to the last episodes the less I enjoyed the show to the point where I would only watch an episode every other day. At times, the story seemed a bit rushed and sloppy with the addition of underwhelming antagonists. The conclusion had me shaking my head because of a romance that was crammed into the last few episodes rather than developed throughout the series. Normally, I rejoice with a \"BOOYAH!\" when these moments finally occur. This ending left me nothing with more than confused and sad \"Booyah..?\" Maybe the story would have been better off without the last second romance. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed the visuals. The background, character designs, and animation were practically flawless in my opinion. I felt that the art made the setting and characters seem dream-like, which fits the show perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe music was outstanding. I will probably never say this about a show again, but the songs in this series were so catchy that I even downloaded some of them. The OP was good but what really caught my attention were the original soundtracks played throughout the show. For those of you familiar with LiSA or enjoy Sword Art Online's opening theme (sung by LiSA) than you might enjoy this show simply for the music because she is featured in some of the songs. I suppose the background music wasn't anything special, but it fit each situation appropriately.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nThe character development is a big reason I was disappointed by the show. The show features a wide variety of characters, all unique and entertaining in their own way. Some of the characters were explored fairly in depth where their pasts were exposed and state of mind shaped as the series progresses. However, many characters were left in the dark that I would have enjoyed being investigated more. I found the supporting characters to be more likeable than the main characters a lot of the time mostly because they were generally the center of the comic relief and source of character uniqueness. Even so, I felt all the characters, both main and supporting, made the show unique and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nAlthough I found many things wrong with this show, I couldn't help but love certain aspects.  Much of my enjoyment came from the soundtracks rather than the plot and it slowly deteriorated as the show progressed. There were also more soundtracks in the first half, which is also why I enjoyed it much more than the second half. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nAs I said before, I was disappointed at how the show concluded. I feel that the series would have been much better if it had been lengthened to 20+ episodes with enhanced character development and plot adjustments. The plot of the show proved to be very promising in the beginning and never achieved its full potential. Even with all of this said, I do not regret watching the series and would consider watching it again. This show may not be memorable for everyone, but I feel that just about anyone could enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, anyone who liked Haibane Renmei, Sword Art Online, or Clannad could probably appreciate this anime.\\n\\n\r\n Hope this helped!\\n",

            "content": "Angel Beats is a marvel, no, a monument of modern Japanese animation. It is a series that has no reason to exist other than to market off of otaku and has no merit to it at all. I guess you could say that this is the spiritual successor to Code Geass, except at least that shallow marketing machine of a series had a little substance to it.\r\nThe series is about Walking Cliche Male Protagonist, Haruhi with a Gun, and her sidekick Nagato with her Hair Grown Out. The names are long, but you'll remember them. Follow them on a pseudo-deep story about rebelling against theGods of Television and becoming the most popular thing on TV while exerting the least effort. A quest which they are failing at so far, as Senko no Night Raid has been beating them in the ratings. To be fair though, that show has the unfair advantage of being original.\\n\\n\r\nBut really, being popular is basically all there is to Angel Beats. It's what everything in the series is about. Every aspect of Angel Beats is geared toward that singular purpose.\\n\\n\r\nIts main characters are ripped straight from another popular show and its supporting cast is a band of archetypes. Its setting is an excuse to have well-animated action scenes to draw in those who like eye candy, but inexplicably shoehorns in a school for the sake of familiarity. It has concert scenes because they were well-received in other shows. It has comedic death and revival gags because another show was successful with it. Even the needless punctuation in its title is mooching off the success of something else.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not telling a story, nor is it doing much of anything except using a bunch of unrelated but trendy devices. It's a nightmarish monster of mismatched anime pop culture. It directly targets the lowest common denominator of anime fandom, and is barely succeeding. This is just sad.",

            "content": "Note: I ain't no english speaker\r\nWelcome to MAL where a mediocre and predictable tear-jerking/slice of life/ comedy series is ranked 100 spots over NGE. The magical place where fanboys will defend their favorite crappy anime just so a bunch of pretentious teenagers that think that they are intellectual can complain about their shitty taste and make fun of them (oh wai--)\r\nIf after reading that paragraph you are not quite sure what is my opinion about Angel Beats! then let's get down to the proper review.\r\nPRODUCTION VALUE\r\nI cannot bash this anime on this particular aspect as it has top-notch animation combined with beautiful art. It wasproduced by P. A. Works, a studio with tons of money that prefers to invest it in these mediocre melodramatic stories instead of something good (although wether or not it works for them from a business point of view is a different story). The atmosphere is pretty much the same you see in any anime of this genre with the exception that in this case everything is perfectly made. Even if there are some pretty terrible frames and a certain sense of money-saving at some points, the overall animation is well done with outstanding effects.\\n\r\nAs for the sound, the voice acting is pretty generic, although they certainly do know how to use effects. The soundtrack was surprisingly average. With the amount of music this anime uses (plus the fact that there's a rock band in it) it was absolutely marvelous that none of the songs were memorable. As for the opening it just flies over your head, and the ending is decent.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nAlright! Who's ready for some shit-storm?! The anime has some good ideas, I'll give it that. The whole thing of seeing how people spend the after-life and making fun out of death constantly is not something you see everyday. But really...a high-school? From all of the possible settings to choose they decide to develop these ideas in...a high-school? I mean just imagine the possibilities of working with such a premise and they decide to go with the safest and cheapest route, by combining teenagers, angst, melodrama, bad comedy, a little bit of action and...a high-school.\\n\r\nBut after all, being set in a high-school with angsty teenagers doesn't necessarily means it's bad, right? WRONG! I mean, sure it doesn't, but here the problem is that Angel Beats! is all over the place. The comedy is at times dark humour about how funny watching others die is, and then a light-hearted slice of life comedy. None of the themes brought to the table are properly developed nor answered. A massive amount of plot-holes that they keep adding just for the sake of...adding them. Cheap and bad melodrama that comes out of nowhere with absolutely no backdrop nor proper writing. Sometimes fast-paced action sometimes horrible slow-pacing. A group of teenagers that go to school, fight god, go to school, do shitty comedy, form a super-secret elite squad, AND THEY CHOOSE TO GO TO FUCKING SCHOOL.\\n\r\nThe story is a big mess of multiple things with no proper execution on any of them nor interesting outcomes, neither feels or laughs. Is just a big ball of things with the word \"MEH\" written all over it.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nI can describe Angel Beats!'s characters in three words: underdeveloped, uncharming and bland. All the characters have one or two aspects that reflect their personalities, thus all of them being one-dimensional boring and completely unrelatable. All of them with the exception of the MC Otonashi who totally LACKS any personality. He didn't have not a single aspect. He wasn't one-dimensional, he was zero-dimensional. I didn't like \"Your lie in April\" for many of the same reasons I didn't like this anime but at least that one knew how to build a f*cking great MC. In this case, our hero is totally overshadowed by the rest of the (plain and mediocre) cast.\\n\r\nThe characters all lack a backstory (except Otonashi, props for that) and their development is all thrown into a single episode instead of being built overtime like a proper series would do. That has to do with the fact that the show has many more characters than it needs and many more than it can handle.\\n\r\nAll in all, the cast is poorly designed, bad and surely doesn't provide anything to the already lackluster series.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\r\nThis turned out worse than I expected. I didn't know I hated this anime so much. But now to the real deal, did I enjoy Angel Beats!? No, definetly not. The premise was somewhat interesting and the production was great. But the combination of melodrama, bad comedy, ideas all over the place, frustrating situations, predictable outcomes, enraging plotholes and dreadful cast, totally killed any chance this anime had of being entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'll rewatch Clannad.",

            "content": "It seems to me that there are currently three major anime that are upheld by the vast majority of the anime community as \"the shows that bring tears\". I have heard all three of them described as life-changing masterpieces, stories that transcend genre and qualify as immaculate art. I am of course referring to Clannad & its Afterstory, Ano Hana or The Flower We Saw That Day, and... Angel Beats. While I have my gripes with the other two (Clannad's first season is mostly unnecessary and Ano Hana relies on characters showing emotion counting as invoking the emotion of the audience) I can accept andunderstand how these shows could have a profound impact on people as they earn their emotional moments by carefully developing their characters and setting up impacting scenes way in advance. Hell, Clannad Afterstory even worked on me: I was sobbing for hours. It didn't change my life, but it was a thoroughly fulfilling experience nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nWith Angel Beats though... It's time to bring down the hammer.\\n\\n\r\nI did not find the show to be impressive. It was actually one of the first shows I watched, so I was in a state of being easily impressed, and my first and foremost reaction to it was to forget about it. Nothing it did left a lasting impression on me, and few parts even made me think \"hey, I'd use that element if I was writing a story!\" It has any number of superficial issues that are enunciated by its brevity, and it never really comes together in any profound way to justify this. In fact, if I had to sum up what appears to make people believe that this is an emotional experience, it would be \"disjointed sad things happen while pretty music plays\". That's not really a review though, so lets get down to just about every problem I have with Angel Beats. WARNING: PLENTY OF SPOILERS AHEAD\\n\\n\r\nLets start with the superficial bits: the art and the sound. Both are fairly solid. The ending theme \"Brave\" in particular is absolutely gorgeous. The art style is crisp and the action sequences are clean and flashy. However, I don't really place a great amount of value on the art and music of a show unless they're used in clever or intentional ways to complement the story, so I'm not willing to give many points overall for these.\\n\\n\r\nNow on with the premise. We're in purgatory. \"Ahhh, that sounds quite interesting!\" you say. \"What's it like there? Is it a macabre bar, like in Death Parade? Perhaps a rural village trapped in perpetual sunset? A surreal forest full of fantastical twilight creatures? The possibilities are endless!\" Yes indeed they are endless, and so of course the setting of choice is a high school because f*ck it it's an anime. Granted, this is a purgatory for unfulfilled children, but that's really just a lame excuse to bring us back to everybody's favorite overdone milked-dry setting. So anyways, dead kids who died unhappy come here and are policed by a mysterious stone-faced girl with superhuman powers called Nagato... I mean Angel. When they find fulfillment and are at peace with themselves, they disappear and move on. Our protagonist, Yuzuru AKA red-hair, who earns his name for being a rare example of a cliche male protagonist who doesn't have bangs of luscious dark chocolate, arrives at the scene with no memory of anything (although there's an 11/10 chance its something ridiculously tragic that demonstrates how goddamn great of a guy he is... oh look, I was right) and meets Yuri, one of I-shit-you-not three girls with varying shades of purple hair. There's some convoluted and meaningless exposition, he joins a club she's president of because this is pretty much a high-school show anyways at this point, and then we are introduced to one of the show's largest problems:\\n\\n\r\nIts side characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere's about 75 of them and none of them serve any purpose. Some of them don't even seem capable of saying more than one line. What are these, Pokemon? Each of them embodies one or another anime archetype because the show seems to have this belief that it isn't making full use of its potential unless it has as many different archetypal characters as possible. This is of course with the exception of T.K, who also doesn't serve any purpose or have any depth but at least his eccentricity is original. Actually, he seems like kind of a f*cked up dude. The show might have been a lot better if it had actually delved more into his character. As if to drive home the point that none of these characters have any relevance whatsoever they all quite literally disappear between the second to last and last episodes. Yes, that's right, each and every one of these characters is written off by Yuri saying \"oh yeah they're gone now!\" and that's the end of it. GUESS YOU DIDN'T REALLY NEED THEM AFTERALL, HUH? This meaningless mass of cardboard-cutouts would actually have been a lot less detrimental to the story if it weren't for another major issue with the story:\\n\\n\r\nThe Pacing.\\n\\n\r\nThis show knows how to do two things: throw dramatic bilge at you like its trying to bury you, and have filler. It's like it's not conscious of the fact that emotional moments only have dramatic weight if you develop the characters involved beforehand. The first third of the series is devoted almost entirely to d*cking around with Yuri and her team of soulless archetypes pulling one stupid gag after another. It gives us little to no insight into who these people actually are when they're not sobbing over each other or recounting their dark past. They're just shticks in a gag-reel, waiting for their turn to pop up and give their one-liner that fits their assigned personality type. Even in the later episodes, any moment that the show is not spending trying to be emotional plays out like an episode of goddamn Lucky Star! No one has any normal conversations! It's like they're dummies on autopilot, waiting to be activated when they're needed to gaze up at the sky in melancholy remembrance of the actual f*cking human beings they might once have been. Is this their punishment for being sent to purgatory? Have they been stripped of their ability to have uncliche interactions? Have they been trapped in the sick game of some depraved puppetmaster, pulling the strings and ridding them of their free will? I've kind of moved on already, but I guess I should announce it:\\n\\n\r\nI'm talking about this show's characters.\\n\\n\r\nI get the impression that the way this show was made was that some dude watched a bunch of crappy anime and formed an impression of how he believe anime characters OUGHT to behave. Then, he stuck a bunch of sad backstories on to those characters and had them cry all the time to simulate emotional depth. Seriously, here's a breakdown of the ENTIRETY of Yuri's character\\n\r\n          - she's charismatic\\n\r\n          - she's apparently a good leader because we are told so, though this is never shown\\n\r\n          - she's got a villainous laugh\\n\r\n          - she watched her younger siblings get their f*cking brains blown out at point-blank range by burglars and feels responsible for it\\n\\n\r\nOh sorry, what was that last one? Yeah, why bother with actually demonstrating who the supposed female lead is as a person through interactions and screen time when we can just give her a REALLY F*CKED UP BACKSTORY to contrast her happy and lively personality and call it development! We still know nothing about her as an individual, but... TRAUMA! Bam! Character done! Let's move on to the next one! Let's see... We'll make her a cripple who the world crapped on so that she never got to do anything she wanted. I'm of course talking about Yui, another of the purple-haired girls (yes, they named two unrelated girls with similar hair colors Yuri and Yui) who's character is 100% pure, refined tsundere of the finest essence with absolutely no real personality until 'the episode where she is given a tragic-as-all-hell backstory and then disappears'. Aw, she seemed so lively and excited but there was really misery underneath! Contrast! Sorrow! How did we not see this coming!? Maybe it's because she was an vacant doll up until the moment the story decided to steer its attention to her. You just can't do that: you can't suddenly bring your characters to life when you need them, you need to characterize them whenever their onscreen or else it just feels like a bunch of actors who stop trying as soon as the spotlight isn't on them.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a problem that the show suffers from right up until its very end: its characters only start acting whenever the spotlight is swiveled to them. In the end, we're left with a cast of main characters mourning their inevitable separation from each other in a series of scenes that are on their own quite well-directed but have no impact because I have no attachment to this group of people. I've never gotten to see their dynamic outside of idiotic anime humor, and several of them barely have relationships with most of the members of the group. The show's inability to mellow out, to have its characters interact in meaningful ways and grow closer without sobbing on each other in short, sharp bursts seriously bites it in the ass, as it means that when it is willing to put in the effort to have solid scenes they just don't mean anything. One of the reasons that Clannad Afterstory worked so well was that the first two-thirds were mainly devoted to showing the beautifully simple yet honest daily lives of the characters and the complexities of their relationships with each other. That way I care about the characters before anything bad happens to them. No show should have to rely on tragedy in order to make you become invested in its characters. Sure, Clannad also spent plenty of time messing around but inevitably it didn't hurt it nearly as much because it was still long enough to do everything it needed to. Angel Beats does not have that length. It is a 1-cour show, and it had no time to spare. The fact that it wasted most of it was absolutely lethal.\\n\\n\r\nNo review of Angel Beats would be complete, however, without addressing the most obvious aspect of the show: Angel herself. Angel was definitely one of the more subtly done characters, and suffered the least from the spotlight effect. She developed at a fluid rate and was always given enough attention to maintain her relevance in the story. If the show had earned the right to be about anything, it would be her for sure, not red-hair and his quest to be the single most upstanding dude around and save everyone. His character is standard visual novel trash not even really worth talking about as he falls into all the same pitfalls as the other characters, hers at least possesses an element of uniqueness (at least within the show) and some goddamn flaws instead of just being the most sensitive kind person ever who happened to have unrealistically horrible things happen to her. She's meat-headed, misguided and not especially bright. She's terrible at conveying her emotions and connecting with people. Steadily, she learns about who she wants to be and how to form the relationships she wants to.\\n\\n\r\nBut obviously, this is not what happens. Angel's character instead inevitably becomes defined by red-hair and proves to exist simply to disappear in his arms for emotional impact. She is given some contrived plot-twist to connect him to her (\"My heart is yours by transplant!\") and this of course causes him to...\\n\\n\r\n...confess his love for her?\\n\\n\r\nExcuse me? These two have about as much chemistry as Argon and Neon: they don't react. Even more importantly, the amount of development they've had together is enough to establish them as acquaintances at best, with confessions of love being almost as ludacris as That Time Hinata Told Yui He'd Marry Her. I can only imagine that the creators either made it up in the moment or totally forgot about it until it was time for them to air it and just threw it in there like unfinished cookie-dough into an underheated oven. There's only one reason for this: so that red-hair can end the show by wailing his despair at being separated from his love-of-two-seconds.\\n\\n\r\nThat's her purpose? Poorly-simulated drama for the MC? The random shadow monsters were nonsensical, the massive purgatory fish was to be expected, but this was just... why? The best character is wasted, there's no weight to the situation because it's completely impulsive, and the after-credit scene undoes it anyways so what's even the point? \\n\\n\r\nOkay, I've done quite a bit of bashing. I haven't even touched on all the specifics, but I've hit all the problems that I feel are consistent and what's left is a show that really doesn't have too much to offer. That said though, I didn't hate it. It was bad storytelling: awfully executed, little understanding of characters; but it wasn't offensive, and it did have some good ideas, it just had no idea what to do with them. I certainly wouldn't recommend it, but I've seen worse. Regardless, Angel Beats is not a masterpiece and its unending attempts to make cheap emotional grabs did not impress me.",

            "content": "Short Review: It needed 26 episodes.\r\nLong Review: Angel Beats is a pretty interesting work. The writer, Jun Maeda, is responsible for a number of emotional masterpieces such as Air, Kanon, and Clannad.  Maeda's ability to invoke emotion in his audience is definitely outstanding and thus I had great anticipation for the series.\r\nAngel Beats! is a treat to the eyes and ears. P.A. works did an amazing job with the visuals. The opening animation is a pleasure to watch and the backgrounds can easily rival Kyoto Animation's which is no small feat. The music is also very memorable, and usually appropriate to the situation. Besidesthe opening \"My Soul Your Beats\" and \"Brave Song\", there's also a bunch of songs sung by the show's band Girls' Dead Monster. Some people have noted the songs by GDM sound a bit amateurish, but I think it's appropriate and gives the feel of a garage band trying to make it big.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story, however, is rather confusing and keeps shifting gears. We start out in a mysterious world of the afterlife and in  a place where not even the characters know what's going on. Naturally, a state of confusion would make sense-- except that most of the world is never really explored or explained. And the explanations we do get are often out of left field, and usually shoved in at the end of the episode. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the overall idea isn't bad at all; it's just that the accelerated pacing due to the 13 episodes and the fact that the anime seems to not be sure on where it's going. It just started too much threads.\\n\\n\r\nThe most jarring thing about the show is its inability to separate the comedy from the melodrama. It's often mixed together at the worst moments and becomes very cheesy.  The worst case of this is probably the character of Naoi, someone who should be interesting, but I wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry. Also, frequently the melodrama feels very forced and manipulative because it's just shoved in there-- you've gotta develop a conflict or issue for it to have any real impact.  This was especially true near the end. But Key fans don't worry, there's still some very  sweet moments even if it is very messy. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this, Angel Beats is still a very funny show. At first,the humor didn't click with me, but two words: Rocket Chairs. The silly antics of the protagonists group-- the SSS is fun and its enjoyable to see them do silly stuff like that in this world. And of course the character TK himself seems to steal the show every time he utters a line.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all a fun and likable bunch-- typical for Key. Sadly, a lot of them remained underdeveloped due to time constraints. The ones that they do focus on are very well done-- the amnesiac Otonashi, the competent commander Yuri who's not just another Haruhi, the reliable bro Hinata. The enigmatic Angel is also a decent character who explodes the cuteness meter. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Angel Beats is not a bad show, but it just feels underwhelming that with all the ingredients for success, the show couldn't make up its mind on what to do. Nevertheless, if you're bored and want a few laughs or a few heartwarming moments, you can check this out.",

But I digress, this anime is simply amazing. As to expect from Key and their history of making comedic, romantic tear jerker's, Angel beats does not dissapoint. While its not as romantic, well actually not romantic at all so far, as you would expect from the creators of Clannad, the storyline is downright addictive. If you pass on this, you're missing out on something huge. Although the storyline is its biggest factor the comedy is puregold. There was once an episode where I absolutely could not stop laughing. I spent one hour watching a 24 min anime b/c of my constant rewinding! The ending and opening music is  performed beautifully and the latter is one of those songs you can listen to a billion times and it never gets tired. Trust me this is an anime you cannot afford to pass up.",

            "content": "Angel Beats Review:\r\nPotential. That is exactly what this show was full of. Admittedly Angel Beats was indeed a good show that I really enjoyed watching. However, the show fell short of what I believe it could have achieved in a 24 episode season.\r\nStory 6/10:\r\nMy God the story. THE reason why this show had sooo much potential. Angel Beats is about a student named Yuzuru Otonashi who finds himself with amnesia and in some sort of purgatory in shape of a high school campus. After meeting \"Angel,\" Otonashi is convinced into joining SSS, where he and other students in purgatory fight off \"Angel\" to prevent obliteration.Let me tell that to you again, kids in purgatory are fighting off an angel to prevent themselves from moving on. If you aren't intrigued by that I am shocked. To top that off, there is a plot twist later on that completely changes the dynamic of the show. AND since the anime is from KEY, the makers of Clannad, Kanon, and Air, the usual addition of very strong character arcs is present as well. Now, many of you may be asking, \"if it has all these things, why is the story only 'enjoyable' to you?\" Well the answer in short is that it all felt very rushed. With only 13 episodes, the story progresses very rapidly and tends to skip many important events, expecting the viewer to assume they happened as they are watching. This time restriction also made the romantic element of the show seem completely out of place because the two major romances in the show seem completely random due to scarce evidence that any romance was even budding between any characters until their big confessions. I do applaud the creators though for somehow making Otonashi, Nakamura, Yui, and Iwasawa's short character arcs thrilling to watch.  With only 13 episodes there are just too many glaring flaws, plot holes, and important scenes (particularly the ending) feeling more out of place than dramatic.  With a 24 episode season I feel that the story could have been much more fleshed out in every aspect, making it a truly spectacular occurrence. But even with only 13 episodes it was still a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\r\nWow. The animation to this show was absolutely superb. One of the greatest art from technological standpoint. The only downsides were the lack of outfits for the characters, and the lack of varied locations. However, these flaws were necessary to the show's setting. Basically this show had top of the notch animation and will wow all those who watch it.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10:\\n\r\nOne of the main reasons this show stands out so much. The OP and EDs are fantastic pieces that fit the tone of the show perfectly. To add on to that, the characters in the show actually have a band named GDM that plays fantastic pieces on their own. Really the songs can even make scenes feel very emotional even though they are actually more contradictory and unecessary than emotional (particularly the ending). Like the art, Angel Beats is on another level with its music production. The voice acting isn't anything special however, not bad, but nothing really worth noting in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10:\\n\r\nI feel like some of the characters in this show have a good amount of fanboys and girls. I feel this because their designs, along with the superb animation make these characters have a very good look, although their personalities all were clearly lacking. I personally found most of the characters FAR too one dimensional. This is especially true with the very large ensemble of side characters that never seem to get any proper attention or development. With an uninteresting lead, and one dimensional characters, it usually spells trouble. However, the fantastic character arcs for four of the characters were so good that I really can't say the characters were anything worse than above average. These arcs were truly fantastic. However, because the majority of the cast was one dimensional, predictable, and lacked development, the overall score for the characters cannot really be too high. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10:\\n\r\nI really liked this show. Its story was very unique and drew me in and kept me wanting more until the end. However I found some of the characters annoying, and found the plot holes, extremely random and forced romance, and poor ending pretty annoying as well. I definitely had a good time watching this show, but its issues didn't go unnoticed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10:\\n\r\nFrom the first episode I was captivated by the unique storyline, and this captivation continued until the last episode. However, the show did feel very rushed to me, and the ending seemed completely outrageous to me due to the randomness of it, and how it completely contradicted an entire half of the season. The show also left too many unanswered questions that will most likely never be answered. Because of the lack of episodes I was unable to do what a truly great anime would get me to do, and that is to connect with the characters. It was able to for short powerful bursts in its small character flashbacks, but those alone were not enough for me to truly care about the characters in the long run. I know this review seems like a negative one, but I'm just trying to address these issues because I feel most people have either missed or ignored them. I did like Angel Beats a lot, but I can't help feeling that if the series were twice as long, most of its flaws would have been resolved, and it could have been brilliant, probably passing Kanon on the KEY rankings (Clannad, Kanon, Angel Beats and Air).\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\\n\r\nA unique show that was undeniably good, but could have been MUCH more.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Concept for the plot\\n\r\n+ Fantastic music\\n\r\n+ Beautiful animation\\n\r\n+ Character flashback arcs are amazing\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Execution of plot was inconsistent\\n\r\n- Romance felt very forced\\n\r\n- One dimensional characters\\n\r\n- Ending is suspect\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Angel Beats!, watch...\\n\r\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya:\\n\r\nIf you liked the earlier episodes of Angel Beats where they more or less just fuck around, then you will also like Haruhi Suzumiya. Both are funny and have unique concepts and are very enjoyable to watch.\\n\r\nClannad:\\n\r\nIf the latter part of the show appealed to you and were all aboard the feels train, then absolutely watch Clannad and Clannad ~After Story~ the saddest show known to mankind.\\n\\n\r\n7/10 - Good\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Yuzuru Otonashi has a problem.  He\u2019s just woken up on the ground outside of a strange school, to find out that his unconscious body has been guarded over by an even stranger girl wielding a gun that\u2019s bigger than she is, and the only thing he remembers is his name.  But before he can ask what the hell he drank last night, she explains that he\u2019s dead.  And she says this... while aiming her gun at another girl. She goes on to explain that this other girl, an apparent angel, is the mortal enemy of her and the group she leads... TheUnderworld Battlefront. Or the \u201cLike Hell I\u2019m Dead Battlefront,\u201d depending on what version you\u2019re watching.\\n\\n\r\nBelieving this story to be bat-shit crazy, and who could blame him, the boy shrugs off her story, and decides to approach the other girl, who echoes the first girl\u2019s claim that he\u2019s no longer among the living. He asks for proof, so without hesitation, she stabs him through the heart, killing him. He wakes up in bed later on, his bloodstained shirt serving as a definitive reminder that he\u2019s not in Kansas anymore.\\n\\n\r\nHe\u2019s not in Oz, either... Probably.  He\u2019s in some vaguely defined computer-based version of Purgatory where teenagers end up whenever they die unfulfilled. You can\u2019t die in this world no matter what happens to you, you can magically build inanimate objects out of dirt, and if you take school too seriously, you\u2019ll disappear. This is a lot of nonsense for our hero to take in, but it\u2019s all real, leaving him no choice but to take his circumstances at face value.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf the aesthetic of this series reminds you of famous Kyoto Animation titles such as Kanon, Air, and Clannad, you\u2019re not too far off...  Angel Beats was designed by the same people who created the original visual novels for those other shows.  That\u2019s where the comparison ends, however, as the animation was done by a company named PA Works...  It\u2019s a company that has a very small, but very impressive, production history.  True to form, Angel Beats is right at the top of my list of the most well produced anime I\u2019ve ever seen, and I\u2019m not just talking about the visuals.\\n\\n\r\nIf there has ever been an anime that I rushed to buy the soundtrack to, it\u2019s this one.  I haven\u2019t heard an anime soundtrack that was this beautiful since Bastard.  The compositions are diverse, inspired, and in many cases, you can tell exactly what scene a tune is from just by listening to it with your eyes closed.  It\u2019s that good, and it\u2019s that memorable.  The opening theme is probably one of the least skippable I\u2019ve ever seen, with a mind-blowing piano score set to our title character rocking out on that exact instrument.  The ending theme is also great, as it has a very melancholic tone, and the way it ties into it\u2019s video won\u2019t really be made clear until the end of the series.  But the heart and soul of the music...  As well as the heart and soul of this series in general...  Is the fictitious anime band Girls Dead monster, a pulse pounding rock band formed by a handful of the students.  This band has it\u2019s OWN separate soundtrack, and trust me, they deserve it.\\n\\n\r\nWhen talking about the animation, the comparison to Kyoto Animation must once again be brought up...  Angel Beats clearly had just as high a budget as the Kyo-Ani classics, with endlessly smooth and graceful movements from the characters and environment, but unlike most of those shows, it doesn\u2019t waste it\u2019s money on mundane slice of life activities...  Oh no, they do SO much more with it.  This show goes so all out with it\u2019s big, epic Sci-fi action moments, smoothly blending CG with traditional visuals, that it even puts the first season of Haruhi Suzumiya to shame.  Even the background characters...  AKA the NPCs...  Are well animated, and I\u2019ve seen a ton of shows that didn\u2019t bother to go that far.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters?  Well, I guess we should start with the title character.  Angel...  Or, as she comes to be known, Kanade Tachibana...  Is a very problematic character, as some of the greatest flaws in the series revolve around her.  She has a really unique motivation behind her actions, I\u2019ll give her that, but it doesn\u2019t make her a well written character.  I can\u2019t really delve too deep into my problems with her without going into some pretty heavy spoilers, so I\u2019ll be saving my comments about her for my much more liberal post about this series next week.  As for her co-star, Otonashi, well, I also have some mixed feelings about him...  He\u2019s not your typical Key lead, as he doesn\u2019t make a habit of getting involved in other peoples\u2019 problems, but he also doesn\u2019t really do anything else to make up for it...  Aside from commenting on the crazy things all the other characters do, his only role in the story is to form a relationship with Angel so he can pass on what she knows about this world to the Battlefront, but that wouldn\u2019t be an issue if she had ever just told them herself...  Which she totally cold have done at any time.  Having said that, the development of their relationship is one of the better aspects of the show, so I can\u2019t complain too much.\\n\\n\r\nYurippe Nakamura(The girl with the gun), on the other hand, is a very compelling character. She\u2019s active, she has clear motives supported by one of the cast\u2019s most hauntingly tragic backstories, and she\u2019s by far the only character who ever takes the initiative towards moving the story forward. She bears some similarities to Haruhi Suzumiya, both in her appearance and her attitude towards her followers, but she\u2019s also a much more reasonable and intelligent character than Haruhi ever was. She\u2019s strong and perceptive, and has quite possibly the best character arc in the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for our secondary characters, Hinata is the first person who really befriends Yuzuru, and the dynamic between them is pretty enjoyable, despite the forced \u201cBromance or Romance?\u201d jokes. He\u2019s constantly insisting that he\u2019s not gay, and in a flashback, he proves it by showing us how terrible a catcher he is.  Yui is the fast-talking air-head, and while her hyperactive and sometimes idiotic ways are a constant source of annoyance for Hinata, they do show a genuine affection for each other. Naoi makes for a pretty decent villain when he first appears, but after having his cruel ways changed by the power of fwiendship, he basically just becomes a constant gay joke that never gets a punch line. Iwasama is the original lead singer of Girls Dead Monster, and...  Well, despite only appearing in three episodes, you could write an entire paper on her.  In a good way.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast barely deserves to be mentioned, if at all. Oda and Shiina make for some good visual gags from time to time, and TK is one of the laziest character ideas I\u2019ve ever heard of. I\u2019d really like someone to explain to me why he\u2019s so popular.  Those three included, everybody in th supporting cast is pretty much an interchangeable gimmick with a human face.  You could swap any of them out with a girl who likes to skateboard while dressed like a crab, and nothing...  Absolutely nothing...  Would change as a result.\\n\\n\r\nUnlinigual as I am, I can\u2019t say too much about the Japanese dub...  Just that it sounded really, really good.  It\u2019s leagues better than the English dub, which was written by the infamous Stephen Foster, and yes, it stinks opf all his trademarked awfulness.  If you can stomach hearing an awkward line like \u201cI thought you were just some gun-toting girl or something\u201d and not switch languages, then you know less about how people talk than HE does.  He takes a lot of unfortunate liberties with the dialogue, he\u2019s probably solely responsible for the mispronunciation of the word \u2018suplex,\u2019 and it\u2019s just an awkward time to be had in general. I\u2019ll be honest, though, while I definitely noticed how bad the writing was, it didn\u2019t really piss me off until he rewrote one of my favorite Yurippe quotes near the end.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said all that, I can\u2019t condemn the dub  completely....  Like with most of Foster\u2019s work, the writing may be awful, but the acting overall is actually pretty decent.  Likewise, there were a few really impressive performances. Luci Christian is at the top of the class as usual. She\u2019s made a career out of being one of the best emoters in the business, and even though she only gets a single episode of screen time as Iwasama, she still lets her veteran instincts bleed through with every word. Hilary Haag puts her signature hyperactive energy into her role as Yui, forcing me to wonder just how versatile her insidiously high pitched voice can be. Brittney Karbowski owns the role of Yuri, and as I\u2019ve mentioned in previous reviews, she\u2019s always a joy to listen to. David Matranga takes the subtle, humorous edge that he gave to his character in the lead role from Clannad and carries it over to Hinata, to stunning effect.\\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s not all sunshine and rainbows...  Blake Shepherd is the flat out terrible lead role, and for the life of me, I can\u2019t wrap my head around why they trusted him with it. Emily Neves, in the role of Kanade... Um... Well, she doesn\u2019t do a bad job, it\u2019s just sort of mediocre. I mean, if you have three of the best voice actresses in the company in your cast, and give the \u2018lead role\u2019 to an actress who\u2019s career highlight at that point was getting booted off of American Idol, it\u2019s not a very flattering comparison. I would have placed this role in the hands of someone more capable, like Jessica Boone or Taylor Hannah, but to be fair, Emily\u2019s talent HAS grown by leaps and bounds since this role. And TK shouldn\u2019t have had an English voice actor at all, since his entire schtick is that he says nonsensical one-liners in Engrish.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I\u2019d recommend the sub, but if you\u2019re a hardcore dub fan, then the acting in the dub should at least be satisfactory.\\n\\n\r\nThe meat of Angel Beats can be difficult to talk about, so I think I\u2019ll open by saying it\u2019s an anime that you\u2019re supposed to watch with your heart, and not with your head.  It\u2019s full of intense passion, strong emotions, and just enough gripping characters so that any viewer will find at least one to relate to and root for.  The romantic melodrama and tear-jerking tragedy of this  mysterious world is designed to grab you right by the heart and hold on for dear life, because if it should ever fail to keep that part of you engaged, you brain would kick in, and you\u2019d notice right off the bat just how much of an unholy mess this story really is.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the first things Yuri tells Otonashi is that he should just go with it, and accept things as they are. I\u2019d like to think this advice goes double for the viewer... Turn your brain off, because this story doesn\u2019t make a lick of sense. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong here, a fictional story doesn\u2019t have to make sense to our universe. It has to make sense according to it\u2019s own universe. With nearly every single story element, we get an explanation of what it is, an explanation of how it works, and a direct contradiction within three episodes time.\\n\\n\r\nThere aren\u2019t a lot of examples I can give of this without dropping some spoilers...  Once again, tune in next week for that rant...  But you can take, for example, the Battlefront\u2019s attitude towards Angel.  In an early episode, Yuri explains that they have to be careful, and keep all conversations about their plans under wraps, because they don\u2019t know whether or not Angel can hear them.  Well, in only a few episodes time, they\u2019re nonchalantly discussing their plans right on the other side of the classroom from her...  She doesn\u2019t seem to notice, and for the most part, they don\u2019t seem worried that she\u2019ll notice.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd there are other examples... The other students who weren\u2019t brought here from another life are called NPC\u2019s, and while they\u2019re supposed to turn a blind eye to the Battlefront\u2019s antics, they show up in droves to a GirlDeMo concert, and line up for a monster fish meat give-away. The former of the two examples was pointed out by one of the characters... As a matter of fact, a lot of the inconsistencies in this show are pointed out by the characters, as if the writers thought that making the script self-aware of it\u2019s own flaws would somehow make up for those flaws.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of this anime is a serious issue. We get plot point after plot point after plot point thrown at us at break-neck speed, and with no build-up or development for any of them, they just fly by without making much of an impact. There\u2019s little to no character development outside of the main cast, and as a result, more than three quarters of the cast go completely unexplored, existing only to spout off their assigned one-note-jokes and occasionally die for our amusement. I strongly feel as though both of these problems could have been solved if the show had a 24-26 episode run, like it was initially supposed to.\\n\\n\r\nWe\u2019re introduced to important details that quickly become forgotten or conflicted, plot points that are almost immediately made pointless, and the only explanations they ever stick to are the ones that sound like complete cop-outs. The incomprehensible nature of the world they\u2019re in ultimately culminates with an underground scene between Yuri and some mysterious figure in a room full of computers. This is by far the most insulting moment in the entire series, as several of the questions we\u2019ve asked about it are resolved with lazy answers ranging from \u201cIt was like this when I got here\u201d to \u201cThe power of love.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAnd all of this culminates in a conclusion that\u2019s emotionally powerful, as well as a relentless tear jerker, but upon closer inspection is nothing but a clusterfuck of plotholes...  And no, i\u2019m not just talking about the one plothole that everybody knows about.  There are deeper, much more destructive plot holes that undermine the entire premise of the show, take the stakes completely out of the climactic final battle, and render the two strongest episodes completely pointless.  And once you\u2019ve realized them, they will probably make you feel like the biggest fool on earth for loving it as much as you did.  And even as someone who genuinely does enjoy the series, it just can\u2019t be forgiven for writing that lazy.\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats is available from Sentai Filmworks.  The DVD set has been out for a while, and it includes one of the few OVA episodes, which is worth a few good laughs.  The set set can be found for a modest sum on Ebay, and at the time of this writing, it\u2019s available for a bit cheaper as part of the Rightstuf.com December sale.  There are a handful of CD soundtracks that can also be purchased, and if nothing else,those are worth paying a pretty penny for.  There\u2019s apparently also a prequel light novel, but I haven\u2019t read it, because it hasn\u2019t been officially translated yet.  It\u2019s not available on Netflix anymore, but it IS still available on Crunchyroll.  And as long as you\u2019re a member, and don\u2019t have to put up with six commercials per episode, Crunchyroll\u2019s awesome.\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats is a very poorly written story that relies entirely on it\u2019s spectacular visuals to distract you from the phenomenal lack of logic or consistency. It works masterfully on an emotional level, and despite the messiness that you\u2019re supposed to overlook, it never feels hollow or meaningless... but the logical side of Angel Beats is just so infuriatingly bad.  It\u2019s easier to appreciate for what it isn\u2019t than for what it is, though..  It doesn\u2019t follow any clich\u00e9s throughout it\u2019s thirteen episode run, and none of it\u2019s characters fit into any of the tired stereotypes that plague the anime industry, so I\u2019m willing to give it some credit for originality and effort.  But the talent, overall, just isn\u2019t there.\\n\\n\r\nAnd do you want to know the absolute worst thing about it? The worst thing about this anime is that it is physically impossible to not enjoy it. It is relentlessly fun to watch, even for some stick-in-the-mud like me who kept his brain on full blast the entire time. There\u2019s a lot of things it does wrong... Embarrassingly so, at some points... But when it does something right, it knocks it right out of the park. The overly complicated plot comes with a surprisingly simple, albeit poorly constructed, story. The humor isn\u2019t as spot-on as it probably should be, but it\u2019s inspired enough to keep you laughing just often enough. If nothing else, you\u2019ll enjoy the hell out of the production values alone.  I give Angel Beats a 6/10.",

            "content": "Angel Beats is yet again another cross media collaboration between Key animation studios, and visual novel writer Jun Maeda. Together have worked on such projects like Air, Kanon, Clannad, and now Angel Beats. \r\nThe plot centers around Otonashi, a young man who wakes up in the middle of a school yard, with no recollection on how he got there or any memories of his past. He is then confronted by a girl holding a rather large gun, her name is Yuri, the leader of a organization called the SSS, a group devoted to fighting god and his angels. Confused by her offer, Otonashi declines anddecides to confront this 'angel', seeing how she appears to be a lonesome little girl. Unfortunately for Otonashi, this helpless little girl somehow manifests blades from her arms and stabs him. After waking up, again, but this time in a hospital. Yuri and the rest of the SSS reveal to him that they are actually stuck in purgatory, and how they can't really die within this world, but if they were to pass on, something Angel intends to make them do, they will reincarnate into another life. Yuri and the SSS rather not pass on, instead, they would rather fight against the god who destined them to have unreasonable lives and possibly reincarnate into water fleas. Otonashi agrees to join Yuri and her group, hoping to regain some recollection of his past and learn the mysteries of this new world. \\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats starts off with great promise, interesting concepts and likeable characters, but ultimately fails to live up to anyone's expectations. People put the blame on the fact that everything in this series is restricted to only 13 episodes. But personally, I put the blame on the writer Jun Maeda. His work in visual novels is quite apparent in this series, as it seems like he's only good at writing scenarios, not a straight linear storyline. A competent writer should find a way to string these characters and events in a organic matter, instead of turning it into a nice jumbled mess. \\n\\n\r\nEverything in the show feels episodic. It presents 'important' plot points and characters, but by the next episode, it disregards all previous plot points in favor for this new one. Rinse and repeat over the course of 13 episodes. As a example; the series also introduces a new villain about mid-way through the series, but over the course of a single episode he joins the SSS. Because of this, the story of Angel Beats feels aimless. It has no conflict, no resolution, doesn't center on a particular character or even a villain. Jun Maeda blames that he 'wrote too much' for Angel Beats, which is why it turned into a cross media project, but why couldn't he craft a storyline just for the anime, and leave everything else to the small series of light novels or the manga? \\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that does shine in this series is it's diverse cast of characters. Like I said earlier, they are all very likeable and surprisingly memorable. Even more so with a fan favorite called TK, a mysterious english speaking character who's constantly dancing. Because of this, the humor and interaction between the characters works really well, it makes for some enjoyable moments. But isn't it a little sad when the humor is more enjoyable than the drama in a supposedly 'character driven' series? \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the drama, it's nothing but forced. It's mostly used for the sake of making the viewer feel sad or a weak attempt to feel something for a otherwise unlikable character. This of course is done in a series of flashbacks into the character's lives, before their new lives in the SSS. Does it have any real impact on the storyline? No. Does it add anything to the characters? It does in a few cases, but not all. Most of the time you'll be wondering what was the entire point of that sequence, as it only serves as a weak selling point to feel empathy for the character. Which I hear is more apparent in Jun Maeda's other work such as 'Clannad', but I have yet to seen that series nor have interest in it. \\n\\n\r\nSomething I feel like I should point out is the finale, I won't reveal any spoilers, but it does start with a lick of promise and is touching in a sense, and it leaves on such a bittersweet note that could have left the viewer feeling satisfied with the conclusion. But there's a added scene after the ending credits that almost destroys everything the series is built around. Instead of teeing the story together, it just leaves you with more loose ends and questions. Now, there's a 'unaired' episode that will be included with the DVD and Blu-Ray release, but I doubt it will add much of anything to the ending. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Angel Beats has nice characters and good looking animation, but the episodic pacing and muddled story leaves the entire experience a little left to be desired. \\n\r\nI find it a little hard to recommend a series like Angel Beats, because of the reception for it seems to be quite mixed. People who are fans of Key's past works seem to enjoy the series, but think it's one of the weakest ones they produce yet. While people like me feel like it's one of the most underwhelming anime's to premiere this season. \\n\\n\r\nRating: \\n\r\n5/10 \\n\\n\r\nCheck out if the show somehow interests you, but don't expect much.",

            "content": "Firstly, I've heard that Angel Beats is best enjoyed by exploring its other media types as well (short stories, manga). However, I have neither the time nor urge to do so, and therefore this review is based solely on the anime series. Created by the same people who made Clannad and Kanon, many had high hopes for AB and I myself predicted that it would be nothing short of excellent. To be honest though, it did not entirely meet my expectations.\r\nThe first episode starts off strongly by introducing many ideas regarding the story, although a lot of things are left unexplained. However, as theseries progresses details are gradually revealed bit by bit. The setting of AB is a school that's part of the afterlife, and it's this mystery and intrigue which makes this anime quite appealing in the early episodes. Another interesting twist is that all the main characters are already dead, which opens up many opportunities for creating comedic situations. Throughout the series you'll encounter drama, comedy and a fair bit of action. Personally, I thought the drama (eg. flashbacks on how unfair life was for certain characters, which is why they won't accept their deaths) was most effective at telling a story such as this. I found that the strongest episodes were the ones which took the plot seriously and focussed on the drama aspect instead of the comedy. The comedy can make you laugh whenever it\u2019s done correctly, but too many jokes are rubbish and/or repetitive. At times, comedy is put in the wrong places and ruins the momentum of the anime, causing a sudden standstill to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is excellent in AB. The studio responsible is P.A. Works, who've also produced high quality animation for True Tears and Canaan. Character models look great, although some of the characters look similar to each other. The various action scenes in this series are done very well which makes the battles fluid and exciting to watch. Music concerts which take place in specific episodes are a visual treat and a great spectacle.  No complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is another one of this anime's strongest points, especially the theme songs. The opening is probably one of the best I've seen, with a soulful track accompanied by superb animation which changes slightly for each episode. The ending credits also changes as new characters are introduced and older ones disappear. The timing and choice of background music at certain moments are a big help in setting up the emotional scenes as well as the funniest parts. There's also a music band in the storyline who play insert songs (ranging from good to great ones) throughout a few episodes. The dialogue is okay and voice acting pretty decent. Together with the animation, this shows a lot of time/money was put into the production to makes its quality stand out.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a mixed bunch, and represent one of the weakest areas of this show. The protagonist, Otonashi, is quite bland at first because he's lost his memory and we know nothing of him, but he doesn\u2019t improve much throughout. There's Yuri, the leader of the SSS with a strong personality, and when you see a flashback of her life it's easy to understand why she wants to be a rebel in the afterlife. Her rival is Angel, a mysterious person who tries to deter the activities of the SSS group. With the exception of maybe two or three, the rest of the (reasonably large) supporting cast don't have much development and are only around to say a few lines and contribute to some comedy and fighting. Perhaps it would have helped if this anime was longer, like 26 episodes, to explain how more of them came to the afterlife and why they fight. I didn\u2019t judge the cast by their appearances, but by a combination of their personalities, backgrounds, significance to the plot and their interactions with the other members. Taking this into account, many characters in AB are largely forgettable and difficult to become emotionally attached to. Deep characters (main and supporting) are a must in an anime that relies heavily on mystery and drama, and in this aspect AB fails to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the major flaws of AB is the episode count. I\u2019ve seen anime which have done okay with only 13 episodes, such as Kino\u2019s Journey and Elfen Lied. Angel Beats, however, is not one of them. It doesn't help that as the story picks up in the final episodes new plot elements are introduced and existing ones are just dumped to the side or rushed to completion; this results in terrible pacing and leaves more questions than answers. Also, a lot of suspense and mystery is built up in the first half of AB, but the revelations and plot twists are far from massive. By the end of the series, we still only know the backgrounds of four or five of the cast. As I've mentioned, the drama is one of the things AB does very well, but when it's squeezed into an episode it can feel forced and unnecessary. It also doesn\u2019t help that some early episodes barely progress the plot and instead acts like filler material, with comedy being its main focus. I like comedy, and I'd welcome it in any series if it improves the entertainment, but not at the cost of other aspects. AB is already too short, and a lot of the \"funny\" dialogue/scenes could have been devoted instead to developing the plot/characters/drama further.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, there are some great ideas here, but it's a little frustrating when the fantastic production values (animation, music) of this anime aren\u2019t matched by the other areas of it (plot, characters, pacing). It has its fair share of flaws but also some great moments, so if you like the plot summary, or have enjoyed Key's other works, then give this series a try because a lot of people probably enjoyed it more than I did. Angel Beats is a good anime series, but I think that it had the potential to be so much better.\\n",

            "content": "All right, I need to come clean and say, this is probably one of the hardest reviews for me to write. Probably because it might seem like my scores don't justify what I'm actually saying.\r\nFirst of all, Angel Beats might be my favorite anime of all-time. Is it the best anime I've ever seen? From a storytelling point of view, probably not. I won't lie and admit it has its flaws. However, there is just something about this anime I found extremely enjoyable. So much so where I go back and say, \"flaws? What flaws?\"\r\nI guess I should just start with the story. Otonashi wakesup and finds himself on a school ground that he isn't familiar with next to a girl holding a sniper rifle. She informs him that he is dead and that they are fighting against Angel, a girl that also attends this school with supernatural powers. Otonashi reacts about how you'd expect him to...in that he doesn't believe her and then confronts Angel, only ends up getting killed again and wakes up in this school rebellion's base. Everything at that point is explained to him and he ends up joining this school's rebellion against Angel, even though he has no quarrel with her, in fact, if anything, is intrigued by this girl. I realize this is an extremely vague way of telling the story, but I do not want to spoil too much for the later events that happen in this series.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps I should begin with what I liked about this series. The primary thing I liked most about this series was the characters. It had probably the most likable cast of characters I have ever seen in an anime. Each character had their own personality quirk and it was interesting to see how they all interacted with each other. They shared their happy moments, their intense moments, and even their sad moments. Despite the horrific back stories that many of these characters have, it still felt like you could relate to the characters. That would be the second thing I liked most about this anime and that was the main characters' back stories. They were gritty, scary, heartfelt, you name every possible sad emotion, you could tie it to the back stories of many of this anime's characters. The one that stood out to me the most was Yui's back story as well as her story arc that was expanded upon in one episode. I can honestly say I have never cried so hard at an entire episode and I would say it had a lot to do with a relatability I had with Yui's situation in that episode. I would be ignorant not to mention the excellent animation and music within this anime. It was just fantastic. Many fans/reviewers that I see use this as one of the few bright spots about this anime...although, I'd say that it has a few more than they would say.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, this was a hard anime for me to review because it was one of the most enjoyable animes I have ever seen despite it having many flaws. One of the major flaws was the setting. I will admit, it was unique and it seems to cause quite a bit of confusion to what it actually is. I've seen it called heaven, a purgatory, a realm, etc. To be honest, calling it a purgatory seems to grind my gears. I have a very hard time calling it a purgatory since purgatory is supposed to be (according to my beliefs) a spaceless, empty void, which this world is not. However, its not Heaven or Hell either and it's not specifically explained throughout the anime as to what exactly this world is. If I had to make an extremely broad guess, I would guess it is similar to perhaps the Bosom of Abraham. The Bosom of Abraham has many definitions due to the belief system that you have, but according to mine, it is a place in Hell reserved for those who will ascend to Heaven, a place where you won't be punished for your sins in the pits of Hell, among my belief of that is where Jesus spent three days before rising to Heaven on Easter Sunday. Sorry for the Christian banter, but it was really the best way I could possibly put what this world was. All-in-all, what we know (or learn) about this world is that it is an afterlife of some sort and once the characters learn something about themselves or accept themselves, they disappear. Once they disappear, it isn't explained what exactly happens to them. While some would call that a flaw, I don't necessarily call it a flaw. I see it as more of \"you're seeing the world through more of a 1st person point of view rather than a 3rd person. You're sort of learning as the characters are learning. In essence, you don't know more than what the characters know. It makes for a rather intriguing dynamic. While I don't consider it to be a major flaw, I was still puzzled as to why there wasn't a definitive explanation at the conclusion to this anime. \\n\\n\r\nI would say another minor flaw to this anime was the backstory of Kanade Tachibana (Angel). While we get a vivid back story on Otonashi, Yuri, Yui, Ayato, Iwasawa, and a few other characters, Kanade, who was a major character got very little explanation to her back story. Considering she is one of the major characters, I found that odd but it did leave to mystique and mystery throughout about who she really is. In the end, it wasn't really explained which disappointed me a little, but not to the point where I'd call it a major flaw.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm just not sure what to think of Angel Beats because to say it is a flawless anime is incorrect. It does have flaws but what I liked about it was that the flaws did not retract from the overall experience. This anime was a fun experience that really did a great job of tying in several different emotional attributes. From comedy, to drama, to romance, to action, this anime has a little bit of everything and while many don't have the highest opinion of this anime, I found it to be absolutely fascinating. Definitely worth a watch.",

            "content": "I have to admit that I first started watching Angel Beats because of two main reasons: the pretty visuals, and the presence of guitars. But once I began watching the show in earnest, I found a lot more here than I expected. Angel Beats is a show that keeps me guessing, and consistently tugs at strings I didn't know existed until they were pulled. \r\nBasically, Angel Beats is about an afterlife in which a group of dead students refuse to 'move on' to the next life, because they have some sort of peace to make with the world and themselves. There's a unique mix ofcommon school life against the supernatural. It's a setting that I found to be original enough; I also expected it to be a simple tear-jerker, but that isn't the case. \\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats has a duality about it. One part of it is comedy - most of it is well timed, and on several occasions, had me laughing out loud at my screen like a nutcase. The English-speaking, nonsensical TK doesn't even need an introduction anymore. Even the slapstick comedy is quite well done, and usually timed with unfitting music which (for the most part) heightens the comedy. \\n\\n\r\nThe other part would be the melodrama. Most of the important characters have a back story to them, which are revealed piece by piece. And, as to be expected, many are torturous, depressing tales. These stories aren't your stereotypical 'my puppy died' stories; in fact, I've found that most of the stories that have been revealed are all original in some way or another, and interesting as well. Their common theme seems to be 'regrets' - especially those of teenagers struggling with family, society and life in general. \\n\\n\r\nTopping it all off and decorating the whole package is a very clean, crisp presentation, and music that can move you from the first time you hear it. The rock concert scenes are some of the finest I've ever seen, with spectacular animation and crisp lighting effects. The music alone made me re-watch the concert episodes over and over. The art is also very pleasant on the eyes, with soft but vibrant colors and simple but effective character styles. \\n\\n\r\nThe greatest problem that many people make an issue out of is the transition between the two previously mentioned parts of comedy and drama. Sometimes, the parts can seem fragmented and poorly transitioned. But I only noticed this after I heard the criticisms and look for such inappropriateness. I'm a fan of such shows that mix in different types of enjoyment. Angel Beats also isn't a stupid show; I never felt that my emotions were being toyed with in a rudimentary or heavy handed manner. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I'm trying to say is that while this may seem contradictory and schizophrenic to some, overall, it seems to be a fairly successful blend to me. I found I actually liked being proven wrong about my guesses as to 'what kind of show this will end up being'. And I know that many scenes will evoke familiar memories from other shows, but really, this show deserves to be considered as it is, by itself. \\n\\n\r\nLet me do some breaking down: \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 7\\n\r\nThe story is revealed irregularly; some episodes teach you various things about the world, while others spend their time screwing around. I had fun watching those anyway, but I can see how others would think it's a waste of time. \\n\\n\r\nART: 9\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful. Beyond what we've come to expect, the animation is amazing (especially for the concerts), and the lighting effects give the show a slightly washed-out, surreal look - which I'm sure was the intended effect. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10\\n\r\nIt's been a while since I've liked every song in a show. Some of the BGMs are repeated a bit often, but the feature songs are all brilliant. The seiyuu also do a fine job. No voices will annoy you - unless it was intentional. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 7\\n\r\nThis one's tricky, as many of the characters' back stories are still veiled. Some characters seem to follow the usual anime tropes, but they work. I definitely felt more interested in a character once I learned more about their past. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9\\n\r\nThere's a very obvious sign as to how much I'm enjoying a show; I get antsy and check for updates every hour. The more I see, the more I want. The concert scenes alone are worth the watch. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8 \\n\\n\r\nI guess in the end, your enjoyment of Angel Beats will depend on whether its various aspects strike a chord with you or not (pardon the pun). For my part, I'm glad to have found a series that keeps me guessing, interests me with its premise, dazzles my eyes, while making me laugh and sniffle in the same episode. \\n\\n\r\nThis one's definitely worth your attention, at least until you're absolutely sure you don't like everything about it. Check it out. \\n\\n\r\nPOST SCRIPT: \\n\r\nAfter having finished this series, I needed to add a short addendum - because it helped me realize the potential problem of this series. In short, it's a little messy. If you watch the final episode, you'll probably come to realize the main theme of the series (the entire first half of the final episode is dedicated to it). But when you do, you start thinking of ways in which certain story elements could have been developed and presented a little better. \\n\\n\r\nI can't help but compare it to Clannad, a series that expertly manages the drama and the waves of emotion from the viewer. It's almost like the show is psychic, and knows exactly when to say or show something in order to get the maximum emotional impact and reaction. Compared to that, Angel Beats is more than a little awkward; in particular, the final scene - it just didn't hit me as hard as I thought it should. I was affected, but was distracted at the same time by the clumsy dialogue and the sense of too many unexplained factors. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I'm very glad I spent time with Angel Beats, and will surely miss its presence. At the same time, it pains me to think of how much better it could have been if the show didn't feel so rushed, and if the writers had put a bit more planning and effort into the final moments.",

            "content": "Sometimes anime studios manage to confuse me, not because of anything they do, but because of what they don't do.\r\nTake Angel Beats as an example.\r\nAny fan of certain Key visual novels (or their KyoAni adaptations), will undoubtedly be familiar with the work of Maeda Jun, whose inimitable style, approach, and methodology to storytelling is clearly on display in Angel Beats, and on the surface this may actually seem like a good thing. Given the whole concept of a high school purgatory one would think there was enormous scope for the tale, and in some aspects the story is delivered very well. The only problem isthat as a viewer, I'm kind of getting bored of watching the same thing over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nHere's what I mean. Angel Beats takes the idea of purgatory (to those of you who don't know that word, google it), and places it firmly in a high school setting, something which is familiar territory to Maeda, and while the plot actually works fairly well within that setting, there isn't actually anything that I found inspiring or moving in any way. In addition to this the whole basis of the story is that this particular purgatory is only for young people, however one has to question why this is so, and also why the only young people who get to go there are all people with regrets.\\n\\n\r\nConfused? Throughout the whole series not one character actually displayed any kind of violent or vengeful behaviour in their past life, and this omission place a huge bias on the story. As far as I'm aware, the nature of purgatory is that it exists not only for those with regrets, but also for those whose sins aren't great enough for them to be sent to hell.\\n\\n\r\nPurgatory is, in effect, the last chance a soul has to \"get it right\", and whilst Angel Beats does kind of show this, the lack of anyone who died for revenge makes the whole story unbalanced. The fact that almost everyone in the story only has regret makes the whole show a bit too sugary sweet, and while the whole series is actually pretty well written, this only makes the areas that are missing  more pronounced.\\n\\n\r\nStill, the plot is paced nicely, and the idea is definitely unusual for a high school series. There's also the inclusion of certain elements that are interesting, but the show never really puts them to good use until near the end of the series and at that point it just seems too little, too late.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to another area of confusion, the art and animation throughout the show is actually pretty decent on the whole. The characters are designed nicely and have a certain look about them that really does remind one of KyoAni's work with Key. The backgrounds and scenery are pretty normal (the high school setting doesn't really allow for much in the way of creativity), and don't really set themselves apart from other shows of this ilk.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is actually the concert scenes. The whole series is designed and animated in a certain style which at first seems pretty decent. Then P.A. Works make concert scenes that not only look better, but have more fluid and detailed animation, are better choreographed, and are just plain superior to the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nWhy not do the whole show in this way? It's as if P.A. Works are telling the viewer \"this is what we're really capable of, but we're not going to give it to you so you'll have to make do with the leftovers\". If the whole series was animated in the same manner as the concert scenes then this would easily be one of the best looking shows in anime, and the fact that the viewer can clearly see that P.A. Works are capable of much greater things is more than a little annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, while Angel Beats looks decent where it could have been great, it sounds so much better than one might expect. Given the high school setting there's a wealth of character types on display, including the voices. The acting is pretty decent throughout, but there's very little for the seiyuu to work with as the characters are pretty much one dimensional (more on this in a bit).\\n\\n\r\nWhat really steals the show though, is the music. Yes, there are very well produced concert scenes, but the music that's actually used throughout the series is pretty good too. Surprisingly, Maeda is also the composer for Angel Beats, while the actual arrangement of the thematic pieces is done by Anant-Garde Eyes. As for the title tracks the OP, \"My Soul, Your Beats\", is a decent enough pop song, while the ED, \"Brave Story\", is a rather nice ballad.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the characters go, it's here where Angel Beats begins to suffer from the inherent lack of creativity. While there are some nice ideas and concepts in the show, the fact that Maeda and director Kishi Seiji have opted for the stereotype leaves a lot to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say that the characters are bad per se, no, it simply means that they are very much as one would expect, right down to their personalities. Yuri, for example, reminded me of a certain leader from a particularly famous KyoAni franchise. While the similarities between characters from Angel Beats and other shows may sometimes be only skin deep, the fact that no thought was given to trying out something new, especially with the more interesting ideas that the show toyed with, makes one think that the business side of the industry has taken over, at least where this show is concerned.\\n\\n\r\nNow while I've been fairly critical about Angel Beats, that doesn't mean to say that the series is bad, or that I didn't enjoy it. The fact is that this show has something to offer to many people, and while I may not be a hardcore fan of this anime, or hate it with a passion, I can honestly see why those perspective are valid. The simple fact is that Angel Beats truly did have the potential to be something special in anime, and that has been wasted in favour of producing something that will appeal to the existing moe fan base.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, the whole industry needs to make money (and what better way than to milk it from fans who don't know any better by giving them more of the same), but it would be nice if, just for once, one of these creators would actually give us the series that they truly want us to see.\\n\\n\r\nThen again, that's probably nothing more than a pipe dream.",

            "content": "Angel Beats!, an anime hailed by many to be one of the best, if not the best anime ever, but also an anime many think its bad and seriously overrated. So where does it stand? Well, it isn't downright terrible, but it's not the best anime there is either, no, it's not even close to it. \r\nI think the main story is summarized pretty nicely on MAL so I won't go in much depth on that. The first few episodes were presented nicely, and definitely looked promising. It introduced you to the characters in the SSS and Tenshi, and for me, I think they dida good job on it, making you want to know the truth of the afterlife and how the characters ended up there. From there, however, it started to fall apart, bit by bit.\\n\r\nYou see, when an anime is only going to be 13 episodes long, it can have the tendency to get rushed a lot. And when an anime gets rushed, it can usually leave no room for development on both story and characters, sometimes cramming a huge amount of plot in one episode to even make it feel confusing. That's exactly what happened with Angel Beats!. The short duration of the series was at fault when the characters couldn't even get a proper development and backstory and mostly because of that, the story, on the whole, fell short. The huge amount of comic relief (at times, unneeded) didn't help much either. Honestly, they could surely have sacrificed some of the rather drawn-out comical scenes for some backstory right? Well, they obviously thought showing like only 6 backstory (out of like 18+ SSS characters) was ok enough, otherwise they could have shown at least one or two more even in just 13 episodes.\\n\r\n     Also for the ending... well it's loved by a lot of people and disliked by others. As for me, I was very disappointed by it. The romance buildup towards the ending only had a few episodes to go for, and was rushed and just crammed together in the last few episodes, having almost no development whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is a standout. It was just stunning, beautiful and eye-catching. The character and background designs were, overall, great. The animation was also great. It was crisp and fluid, and everything from character movements to the little bits of battle scenes we had were animated very well.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the Sound aspect, which I easily thought was the 2 of the best parts of the show, the other being the Art. The OP/ED were great but the soundtracks were really memorable to me. They fit the scenes very well, especially the beautiful and sad soundtracks. To me, without the soundtracks, some scenes wouldn't have felt the same way as it did.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters. What started out as so promising ended up, not terribly, but marred by the short duration of the series. As I have said before, the character development was practically non-existent due to the series being short. The characters themselves, are interesting, but not entirely unique. Likable? yes, Lovable? maybe.\\n\r\nAs I have mentioned before, I was really looking forward to seeing the character's past and how they got to the afterlife. However, with just 13 episodes, even if the character's past is cut short, it just seems so hard to fit all 18 members of the SSS + Kanade in the series. That led to having only about 6 character's backstory shown. This also led to the more interesting characters being overlooked. Characters like T.K., Shiina, or Noda had so much potential to become a great character, but were basically brushed off to the side. \\n\r\nHere's what I hear a lot from people who have completed the series. Many of them say that they didn't cry or feel sad throughout the series simply because that they couldn't get attached to the characters in such short amount of time. \\n\r\nThis, for the most parts, is true, but also depends on the person watching it. For me, I liked some of the characters, and found myself partly relating to some, (who had a backstory that is) but I didn't get attached to them. But like I said, this just depends on the person watching the series. Some could cry and feel sad for days, but others could just shrug it off and say \"meh\".  \\n\r\nSo will you be attached to the characters by the end of the series? It depends. Had the series went on just a bit longer to give characters some more time, most, if not all characters in SSS would probably have gotten a proper development and backstory, and also likely would have made you feel more attached to them. \\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed Angel Beats! despite its flaws. Although most of the enjoyment score comes from the first couple of episodes, the last couple still weren't downright terrible, it was just too rushed to the point it became uninteresting. In my opinion, the comedy was decent but it was just too drawn-out. For the sad scenes, I personally found only one scene to be sad, I didn't cry, but it was still, sad. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Angel Beats! is a good anime with some outstanding aspects to it, accompanied by departments where it could have been executed a LOT better. A longer duration could have helped a lot for Angel Beats! as it could have had more developed story and characters, but what's done is done.\\n\r\nI'd say Angel Beats! is on the overrated side, but being overrated doesn't mean that you shouldn't watch it. Who knows? For you Angel Beats could be a fun, sad, and enjoyable experience as a whole.",

            "content": "Angel Beats! The anime that is praised by many and criticized by few. Sadly I was forced to go stand in the cold critic corner. In all honesty, I was excited to watch this anime after all the suggestions from people and raving reviews. The art looked amazing and I heard the music was incredible. What is a good anime in my book? An anime that effects my grades negatively, because just...one...more...episode! Angel Beats however never gripped me. It made me say: \"Ok that's enough for today, I have a ton of homework anyway...\" My experience can be best summed up in a quote fromanother review: \"I badly wanted to love this anime, but just couldn't...\" \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI obsessively try to spot the cracks and flaws in a plot, but I overlook a lot of flaws in the beginning of an anime to give it a fair chance. From the start the plot's foundation was already showing cracks, but I ignored them due to my high hopes for this \"MUST WATCH!\" The story begins with our main protagonist waking up in some kind of \"afterlife\" and he is greeted by a teenage girl with a sniper rifle. The apparent \"antagonist\" called Angel is, like everyone in this \"afterlife\", immortal, but she has extra powers (cause why settle for immortality, am I right?) The leader of the \"resistance\" is perfectly aware of their opponent\u2019s immortality but she and her group of rebels shoot at her anyway (with guns made from dirt by the way...), even though one of her powers allows bullets to pass straight through her. I was just waiting for one rebel to shout: \"Our bullets have been passing harmlessly through her for the past 5 minutes, sir!\" Then the leader would answer: \"Just shoot harder!!\" I would be crying on the floor! (Not tears of laughter but tears of pain cause I would have fell off my chair laughing!) \\n\\n\r\nThis \"Pre-afterlife\" world is a highschool  (cause every anime needs a bunch of not-so-normal teens that go to high school.) At this school you are given a chance to make peace with your tragic life and move on to your reincarnation. One of the ways to pass on? Get good grades... So this group of rebels against God decide to go to class but not pay any attention...brilliant! Why even go to class in the first place? Another thing that irritated me is they added filler scenes and 3 or 4 filler episodes to a 13 episode anime! The characters and plot never had a chance to develop in that short time because it was given 2nd or sometimes 3rd priority! If you take off your thinking cap, lend it to a friend, sit down and just immerse yourself in the art, music, action and comedy then you might enjoy this anime quite a bit. The plot is also very slow paced and when it finally picks up the pace the anime is almost over, everything is rushed and you end up with a horde of mini-arcs.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nSchool scenario, group of misfits, each an embodiment of some stereotype, it's been done too many times... Let\u2019s start with a positive. This anime had some of the most interesting characters I've seen in a while. I needed to know more and when I realized that they will be telling each character's backstory and revealing the reason for them \"qualifying\" for this school I was ecstatic! There was hope for this anime! Sadly the 3 most interesting/mysterious characters were not even developed the slightest! Their backstories were not even told! You had the chilled guy who never stopped dancing and only spoke small snippets of vague English. You had the introvert girl who was always on her own and who had a love for puppies and the weapon obsessed, hot tempered guy who had a crush on one of the main female protagonists. These 3 supporting characters in my opinion had the most potential. All 3 pushed aside and only used for comic relief... The waste of potential was shocking and really got to me.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNow I need to agree with almost every review here and admit, the art was amazing. The use of rays of light reflecting off objects and the creamy colours were very soothing to the eye. Beautiful backgrounds and scenes complemented the scenarios and were not too busy. The characters had simple, but original designs. (At least most of them...) Even though they were pointless, the action scenes were smooth and flowed. The art was one of the aspects that slightly redeemed this anime and that acted as a safety net to slow it's steady decent down my anime list.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music matched the scenes and really added atmosphere and added emotion to the scenes that were \"meant\" to touch you. (It was incredibly easy to see the formula that the writer followed to try and tug at my heart strings.) One track in particular that played during the last episode in the saddest moment made a smile briefly creep onto my disappointed face.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the art and sound, but those are just enhancers of the story. Sadly great art and sound could never save a wrecked plot, no matter how good. It did cushion the blow however.\\n\\n\r\nENDING 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime's last chance to grab a point or two from me. Sadly even this chance was squandered... I started watching this anime with the hope of sharing the same feels as all the fans of this anime begging me to give it a chance. The ending lacked any emotional impact though... I could almost see the writer add every typical element to the ending to make it resemble a genuinely sad yet still realistic ending.   I unfortunately found the ending devoid of even a scrap of logic and even the timeline of past events shown to the viewer via flashbacks made no sense...(I don't want to spoil anything) But without spoiling I just need to say that the ending makes all the efforts and motives of the \"resistance\" redundant and laughable... Even their reincarnation theory or should I say fear of not wanting to risk coming back as a barnacle is totally blown out of the water...(No pun intended) \\n\\n\r\nNow there is one thing about the end that I need to address, so please skip the next well designated paragraph but NOT the rest of the review if you want to avoid a slight spoiler. You gone? Good :) Don't say I didn't warn you...\\n\\n\r\n***BEGINNING OF SPOILER***\\n\\n\r\nAt the very end the main character and Kanade (Angel) move on and are reincarnated as humans that look almost exactly like their former selves, that are also conveniently the same age and live in the same town/city and Angel is conveniently humming a song from the afterlife so that reincarnated Otanashi (Main character) can recognise the tune and they end up meeting again... Out of all the BILLIONS of lifeforms they could have been reincarnated as...or lets just say for arguments sake that humans can only be reincarnated as humans the odds are still impossible! That is complete and utter bullshit and terrible writing! Haha\\n\\n\r\n***END OF SPOILER***\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 3 + OVERALL: 4\\n\\n\r\nI know saying that you did not like Angel Beats! is like saying you prefer Dub over Sub in the anime community, but I'll carry that burden ;) The art and music were fantastic and the comedy made me laugh, but I struggled to take the anime seriously.  I never knew if they wanted to make things seem realistic or not. If you are going to make an anime take place in the afterlife, might as well throw realism out of the window rather than to try and fix the many problems that come with anime of this genre. Summed up: A group of teens that go to highschool in the afterlife while rebelling against an unknown/unseen/faceless God and shooting an immortal enemy with bullets and guns made from dirt... Immortal teens afraid to die in a world where death means a trip to the school nurse... Some characters did not even have particularly sad stories. One failed to catch a baseball for f* sake... The school is \"designed\" to help souls who had tragic lives accept their fate and move on, right? But why are there no new arrivals throughout the anime? If you take the population of the earth into perspective, then there would be a massive influx of new arrivals at the school daily due to our world being the chaotic mess that it is. There has to be people/teens who live tragic lives 100 times worse than the characters of this anime, but why don't we see them arrive at the \"school\"? \\n\\n\r\nI know this review was horribly critical of Angel Beats!, but I had no choice. Angel Beats! is a rotten egg that has been beautifully painted (Art) and coated in perfume (Sound)\\n",

            "content": "\"-You must be an idiot! You should try dying once!\r\nby the way, that's a clich\u00e9 joke in this world where no one can die. So, was it funny?\"\r\nI'm at a loss for words...\r\nWhat could I say? I keep getting surprised with Key's scriptwriters. Who's already familiar with their works, probably heard the name Jun Maeda before. He's the original creator of Angel Beats. You may not like him, but Maeda's (and his coworkers at Key) manner of creating and conducing a story, be it a light-hearted comedy or a melodramatic romance, is definately worthy of praise. Just look around, Clannad, Air, Kanon and recently LittleBusters! are all well-known series.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you see the description and the pictures for this anime, you actually think there's nothing of \"special\" with it. Guns, girls, music, baseball, god, angels... awesome! But can it all fit together? After a long sequence of Key's emotional stories, I wasn't willing to watch this (aparently) easygoing story with \"afterlife\" or \"purgatory\" theme. There's just too much of it nowadays that it's getting boring.\\n\r\nFortunately I gave it a try and watched the first episode... \\n\r\nSometimes you find these series with a kick off episode so amazing that throws away all your worries and uncertainties. Starting straight with the OP song, without a preview cutscene, you're introduced to the characters and just a few minutes after it, the story starts to develop. Fast paced like this, the viewers, just like the male protagonist are thrown in this \"afterlife world\" where those who doesn't want to disapear, or reincarnate as a caterpillar, must fight against god.\\n\r\nI've read a few reviews with really low scores for AngelBeats, the main reason being the \"lack of originality\" regarding it's story. Let's be fair, the anime industry has been producing series for more then 40 years, it's reasonable to think that some themes would be repeated. However, a recurrent theme doesn't mean the new releases will all be clich\u00e9 or repetitive, what's important is the way the theme is approached and the individual elements each anime adds to it. That being said, I consider AngelBeats an \"original\" anime, even tough the basis of its story is not new, the characters, scenario, art and the development of the plot itself, makes it unique.\\n\r\nThis series has that kind of sadistic/dark humor that you can't deny, it is funny, but without all that gore you would usually see in a show with this theme. It's tagged as \"Supernatural\" here in MAL, but it's the \"family\" kind of anime, that you can watch whenever you want. You won't experience those awkward moments where someone who isn't aware of what's going on see the screen in a not-very-correct moment. (Also the amount of fanservice in AngelBeats is minimal.) With \"death\" being part of the story it's certain that there would be violence in it, but it's in a level that isn't disturbing. In the end, you could call it a \"slice-of-afterlife\", since it has all the elements an generic slice-of-life just with a unusual setting.\\n\r\nFor those who aren't familiarized with Maeda's animes yet, it's nice to point out that they're all full of symbolism, and this one isn't an exception. You always have two perspectives and some things are left in the open for you, the viewer, to make your own interpretation.\\n\r\nThat's why I'd always recommend the subbed version. No offense to the dubbers, they're great. But while watching it in japanese you'll always get more from the dialogue and furthermore somethings become easier to understand.\\n\r\nThe plot had some lose ends indeed, but I wouldn't call them \"flaws\". Considering it's just 13 episodes long, Key and P.A.Works did a marvelous work with it, if you watch it open minded without paying too much attention to the script you won't find a problem with it at all.\\n\\n\r\nOne common issue with series where there are too many characters like AngelBeats does is that you get lost within.\\n\r\nIt becomes confusing to tell who did what, whose name is that, etc. This is something you won't experience with this anime. The characters -I mean, the PEOPLE- of it, each one of them have it's personality well written and it's own importance in the story (be it a main or supportive character) they all had a carefully written background story that does make you feel like you're watching real people with real problems even when it's something unrealistic as being dead.\\n\r\nShiina and Yui, for example, are both supportive characters, but they're important in the plot just like the protagonists, also their mottos and catchy phrases \"how unwise\"/\"what an idiot\" adds that \"spice\", that extra thing, that were missing to take a laugh out of you at certain scenes. They're not just laying there with the sole purpose of being a side-kick for the main characters. \\n\r\nHow often do you see it? A drama anime that manages to keep its direction and focus in the protagonists but still take care of the supportive characters' problems and happy moments?\\n\\n\r\nThere's just one opening theme for the 13 episodes. However, there are small differences in it from one episode to another. Remember when I mentioned the symbolism on Maeda's stories? The OP isn't an exception. The piano, the lights and the way the characters are presented, there's a reason for it all. When you realize it, you start to see it with different eyes and that opening that would be boring to watch becomes interesting. The same applies for the ending theme. The animation of it changes according to the story and in a couple of episodes it's a different song. This is a interesting thing to point out, there're some studios that completely fails to make an emotional ending because after the heartbreaking scene they throw the usual ending theme, a 100%-effective mood killer. In Angel Beats thankfully this doesn't happen and the songs choosen for these couple of endings are wonderful. \\n\r\nThe background soundtrack made for it is nice. It's none masterpiece but fits well with the scenes. If I were to give prise for something of it, would be the sound effects. They used some really nice ones, from horror movies hollywood-style played with classical instruments to new ones made with synthetizers. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is nice, atractive and well drawn, but I'd like to open a paragraph here, if I may, for a special topic that isn't covered in the main score neither in the \"art\" section. It would be for the transitions and visual effects of the anime. This would be all those text boxes saying \"in the next day\" but also light and angle effects. These are subjects the animators took great care of. All the transitions from one scene to another had, how could I say, \"style\". Every time the scenario changed, there would be a tag in the corner with the place's name. It becomes even a visual joke in the anime when the characters goes through several places endlessly. The same for facial expressions, you can sense someone put effort on drawing it. From laughing scenes to dramatic ones, they seemed always convincing. \\n\\n\r\nIf I were to write a \"Trivia\" section in this review, it would become too long for it to be read. I'll just say you'll get some really nice laughing moments with some practical jokes, references they make and definately, character quotes. Specially T.K's ones (the english-speaking guy). Pay attention and you may even find \"easter eggs\" of other Key projects such as Clannad and Air.\\n\r\nI had so much fun with this anime but still I was moved with the emotional scenes. The deeper the story was developing, I was still laughing with the characters but also feeling bad for them. This combination is what makes Angel Beats a masterpiece for me. It's not too dramatic but also not a easygoing comedy, just the exact average between them that I came to love. A beautiful story about life and people.\\n\r\nAngel Beats is a \"compact\" anime with a clear ending. That's why I don't have hope for the 2nd season, however if it happens to appear someday I will be looking foward to it. \\n\r\nAs a final consideration for this review, I'd like to give a advice: Don't watch the special \"Another Epilogue\" right after you finish the main series. Take your time, relax your brain. Otherwise you'll go crazy on theories and alternative endings. Watch it open-minded, without the \"oh, this is so clich\u00e9\" kind of thought, and you'll have a great time with it. Enjoyment-o'-meter: 100%.\\n\r\nNumeric score: Story:9/10 | Art:10/10 | Sound:9/10 | Character:9/10 | Enjoyment:10/10 | Overall:9,8...just give it a 10 already.\\n\\n\r\nUhn... I ended up writing a lot. If you read everything, my huge thanks :D\\n\r\nGoodbye Wild Heaven~",

        {
            "content": "Angel Beats has convinced me that Jun Maeda doesn\u2019t know how to write an original story. His previous hits Air, Kanon, and Clannad have been about a bunch of mentally and/or physically broken high school girls who all fall in love with a guy whose only significant character trait is that he exists, and along the way one of these girls will die of a mysterious illness. For Angel Beats, Maeda twists his tried and true formula by having all the characters dead to begin with, and stuck in some sort of high school purgatory, where a group of high school students shoot a littlegirl in the kneecaps for no good reason.\\n\\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Maeda\u2019s stories are very formulaic. First, he establishes a cast of one dimensional, but likeable characters, and a zero dimensional main character who is designed to be a self insert for the viewer. He then lulls the viewers into a false sense of security with a couple of comedic episodes before dropping a tragedy bomb. In time the main character recovers from the tragedy and an asspull miracle occurs, to ensure a happy ending and negating any kind of character development. Angel Beats follows this same formula to an extent, however due to last minute budget cuts; this had to be crammed into 13 episodes making the production feel rushed and uneven. \\n\\n\nA lot of fans will defend the show by saying that it would have been more coherent had it been given 26 episodes. I don\u2019t buy this. Maeda had a lot of options. He could have told half the story and left it open to a probable second season. He could have cut some of the characters or spend less time recycling the same gags (suicide rushes, rocket chairs, etc.) to make more room for character growth. It\u2019s possible to tell a great story in 13 episodes or less. Haibane Renmei told a similar purgatory story in 13 episodes, and the world was much deeper, and the characters more sympathetic. Baccano had a huge cast, yet all the characters got their time to shine, without taking away from the story. \\n\\n\nIn addition, there is never a really good explanation for why they\u2019re fighting Tenshi. They make her out to be evil incarnate at first, but quickly find out that she\u2019s actually a normal girl. Yet rather than do their research, Yuri somehow convinced everyone to build an underground factory, stockpile weapons, and hold rock concerts just to fuck with everyone\u2019s dinner time. If you stop to think about it, the war on Tenshi was nothing more than pointless bickering started by a petulant bitch. Using the budget cuts to defend the trainwreck of a story is like when high school student complain that they would have done better on a test had they gotten more time. Sometimes, you just have to admit that you didn\u2019t know what you were doing.\\n\\n\nWhile the music for the show was decent, part of me felt it was a ploy to milk more money out of the show. Some of the early episodes focused on a band called Girls Dead Monster who played music as some sort of distraction. However, because they weren\u2019t central to the plot, and because singles were being released so frequently while the show was airing, it all felt like a cheap cash-in to ride the wave of success of K-ON.\\n\\n\nSo if I hated the story so much, why did I stick with it? Simply, it\u2019s because I\u2019m a big fan of the director, Seiji Kishi. He previously did Seto no Hanayome and Tentai Senshi Sunred, which are two of my favorite comedy series. I could see that a lot of effort went into the animation. The lighting and movement was dynamic and smooth. The backgrounds were nicely detailed and had a pleasing color palette. Unfortunately, none of this could save the production from its terrible story. Part of me feels the director was overcompensating for the terrible story by blinding the audience with pretty pictures. This seems to have worked on a large portion of the fanbase since a lot of reviews I have read comment on how pretty it is while glossing over the failure of the story.\\n\\n\nAfter watching Angel Beats and seeing the audience reaction to it online, I feel like it\u2019s done its job of manipulating its audience with false emotions. It\u2019s a formula that has worked for previous Key works, and their sales of figures and dakimakura prove it. Fans of the show that actually finished this review rather than marking it \u201cunhelpful\u201d and moving on, watch the show again. Is it actually unique, or is it the same trite, repetitive crap that\u2019s been plaguing the anime industry for years? Does the story make sense, or is it full of more holes than a cheese grater? But most importantly, is it actually good or are you still lying to yourself?\\n",

            "content": "Angel Beats! is absolutely glorious and perfect. It made me laugh, and cry, and I just loved all the drama and the story is not as paper-thin as one would believe. I thought all the characters were awesome, especially TK xD. The ending made me cry it was so good. In summary, Angel Beats! is amazing and is really emotional and if you haven't seen Angel Beats! go watch it!\r\nHaha just kidding. Angel Beats! isn't actually all that special, and I'm writing this review to just try and send out a message to those of you who have not watched Angel Beats! yet. No I'mnot trolling, I really hated Angel Beats! and the reason I stuck with it to the end is so I could tell other anime watchers to stay the hell away from it. Note: I don't give a shit about the 'moewave.' I like all genres and types of anime, and if an anime is enjoyable or presents a very powerful story (or both, god forbid!) I'd like to tell you about it. It's just frustrating when I see a review (on this anime especially) and the reviewer goes out of his way to say \"I'm going to ignore story and characters because those aren't important.\" That kind of thing makes me flip shit. It's as if I were to sell you a fancy house, but tell you you couldn't go inside. Is that fair? Hell no! Then here, my review on Angel Beats!, and I promise I won't say anything like \"X isn't important\" and waste your time doing so.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nOtonashi, our walking cliche protagonist as another reviewer pointed out, has lost his memories and wakes up in a new world where he realizes people can't die. There he meets several exciting and interesting one-dimensional characters. Yurippe, the leader (who looks suspiciously close to another KyoAni mascot character) is the loudmouth leader of a fighting squadron that wants to \"rebel against god.\" The only thing Yurippe can think to do to \"rebel against god\" is to pick on the class president, who is a frail lolita character and to repeatedly shoot her until she is dead (in a world where people can't die... fascinating how KyoAni got away with this). Then entire episodes are dedicated through traversing a 'dangerous underground path' full of 'dangerous traps.' Then we learn that the guns Yurippe gets are made out of dirt (no explanation). Then a whole lot of sobstories come into play. Almost every episode a character reveals their \"troubled and emotional\" past, and the pacing that introduces it is horrendous and each background story takes around half an episode to go through. \\n\\n\r\nBlatantly, I didn't find the comedy all that funny, seeing as it was just rip offs of other Maeda Jun works, oh and so were the back stories. One of the girls falls into a coma and it is even alluded to AIR.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing as this was anime had so many random filler episodes and insert songs it's hard to really explain the story. Or maybe it's hard to explain because there wasn't one (or if there was it was dastardly weak).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nAside from the numerous background errors per episode where the background changed sizes and the costuming errors (WILL BE FIXED IN THE BLU-RAYS HERPDERP), the animation was really good. Yes, I hated this anime, but I'm not going to lie, the animation was amazing. Bullets bounced off things realistically, and everything was really fluid. There was even water used in the last episode that looked so real that it utterly shocked me. \\n\\n\r\nNow the character design pissed the hell out of me. The main character looks no more original than any third-rate anime. He's a normal build, with a normal haircut, and a normal voice and manner of speech etcetc. Then Yurippe was obviously just a Haruhi rip-off. Try and prove me wrong. What? You can't? Just put a picture of the two next to each other and you'll see. Then comes the art. I really had no opinion but I was leaning toward dislike on it. It looked like a blocky version Haruhi, and all the characters looked like tetris blocks when standing still, they all had this square build for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe opening is awesome. A nice piano piece with Lia as the singer. The ending is okay, I didn't feel much for it, but music is a taste and this part of the review is very opinion oriented.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was also really good. The characters (as bad as they were) had voices that brought out what the creators were trying to do. Ototnashi had a normal voice, Kanade (Tenshi or Angel) had a monotone voice. Etc. To be honest I didn't really know a lot of the seiyuu other than Hiroshi Kiyama and Kana Hanazawa (Araragi and Nadeko respectively, both from Bakemonogatari) but I didn't really care - they did good work.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nEvery character is a cardboard cut out and can be reduced to one word. There's the bland protagonist, the bossy Yurippe, the 'kuudere' (cool) Kanade, a bodybuilder, an egomaniac, a spaz, a dunce, a brute, a fatty, a ninja, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there was TK.\\n\\n\r\nTK is the single most creative piece of work in this entire anime. 90% of his lines consist of broken engirsh and usually make no sense. BUT I'M OKAY WITH THAT! Why? BECAUSE IT'S CREATIVE. There is very very few pieces of creativity in this anime, very very few things that don't follow an archetypal story. KyoAni took a chance and put in something that might be DIFFERENT (oh god what is this) and it simply worked. TK is a funny character and does headspins for no reason and has no background at all. But who cares? He was more developed and more interesting than ANY OTHER CHARACTER. This whole section got a plus one - just for TK.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nI'm sorry. I couldn't do it. I couldn't bring myself to like it, and I know a lot of people who write reviews saying that \"they wanted to like it, they really did\" - and hey same here. The day this anime aired I was so freaking excited. I was ready to call this the anime of the year and I told all my friends to watch it. By episode three I couldn't take it anymore and I absolutely hated it, but I pushed on. I tried to enjoy the next episode. I sat down with my favorite candy (the Hot Tamales) and got myself my favorite drink (a delicious Seltzer) and made sure I watched it when no one would interrupt me. Shit it was hell. Every week. I tried harder and harder and then I realized.\\n\\n\r\nWhy am I forcing myself to like this anime, which is pretty mediocre?\\n\\n\r\nAnd there you have it folks. That's all it is. Mediocre. The visuals can be the greatest on the planet, but that's not going to make me fond of the characters, or become interested in the plot. It's like Avatar by James Cameron, you love it or hate it, and if you love it, you don't love it for the characters, you love it for the explosions and all the pretty doodads and doohickeys involved.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4.8/10\\n\r\nI just averaged the numbers. That's the number I think this show properly deserves. Hey! You may still want to watch this anime. If you do, don't go in expecting too much. If you're able to looks past this anime's flaws in story and character then maybe you're experience will be much different, but if you're bothered by this, I strongly advise against watching this anime. It is not like Haruhi, it is not like CLANNAD, it is not like Kanon, but sure is a blend of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters refer to themselves as \"idiots.\" And holy crap that is one good definition, but please beware viewer, let me warn you, if you consume idiocy, you become an idiot.",

This is absolutely no the show for you if you enjoy story, good characterization, comprehensible motivations, or a coherent setting. Other than the admittedly stunning visuals, the show has very little to offer compared to other media that are far superior in almost every other aspect. To nutshell: amazing animation that guilds an empty shell of a series with so little substance it may as well be filler from start to finish. Actually I take that back, filler from start to finish would actually be more entertaining.\r\nSTORY AND ENJOYMENT (2) I bundlesince I am watching this to have a story played out for me by a set of good characters. This is where I derive my enjoyment. But, the show so heavily under-emphasizes everything about the story that if just a little bit more time were spent on it, clearly fleshing out the world and spending more time exploring it I may have been more forgiving of the other failures such as lack of clear purpose to any of the characters actions, why certain characters exist in the world and can do the things they do (especially with reference to the guild), and what the twitbugger is going on? Maybe I'm being too harsh on this show. There were a handful of moments that were indeed funny and some that plucked at my heart strings like a confused infant first that first learned how to move its hands but it was all so token and felt like one writers half baked idea formed at the end of a storyboard meeting thinking, \"Oh, what if we blow up this character!? It'll be funny! And what if the snarky character does the snarky thing and the wildcard character does something completely random? Lets all get drunk to write that last one cuz it'll be great!\" The most engaging part of the plot were when there was almost none at all and the writers knew this so the story ended up dangerously anemic.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, my biggest grievance with the show was how badly it handled what little plot there was. Without spoiling anything, the ending was so bad you could have served it with some snails and called it french cuisine; it was stale, moldy, utterly perplexing, and smelled faintly of flatulence. \\n\\n\r\nBut lets look at the good parts of the show, because nothing can be all bad. \\n\r\nANIMATION (9) as I've said, the animation is simply superb. It is some of the best animation for a series I've ever seen, and I would argue, almost on par with something like Kara no Kyoukai. Its like visual crack. If you can stand the moe aspects of the show, the character design is varied (for the most part) and each character is visually distinct reflecting the personality of the character fairly well. \\n\r\nThis leads me into the CHARACTERS (3). All of them, with the exception of the MC and one other, are basically one dimensional and can be summed up in a single sentence. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. Like I said before, the show does a good job of using the characters and their unidimensionality as a means of entertainment, but its all very same-y. No risks are taken on the part of the writers to try and develop most of these characters and the one character that was incredibly well fleshed out is put on a bus before even halfway through the season (yes my favorite was the one in the band). The entertainment from this show through its characters is very popcorn-y and safe but at least its still entertaining. But like a good drunk piss, all I really care about is the arc, which few of the characters seem to satisfy, and to me that is disappointing.\\n\r\nSOUND (7)  is another area where the show does pretty okay in. I wouldn't say that any of the tracks really blew my mind, but they were all very well suited for the situation and, as stand alone music, were tolerable to listen to. Most of the tracks are some combination of synth and non-synth strings, piano, and an electronica drum-kit. I will make a special mention of one track, Angel's Flight, which really is just a delight to listen to. Overall a lot of effort was put into the sound track and it shows.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\r\nI think this is best closed by going back to my nutshell, especially since the show metaphorically resembles one. An outer solid shell of good sound and animation which crumbles easily to reveal a decaying seed of story and characters.",

While a lot of people don't share my sentiment, and say that Angel Beats! is nothing special, I disagree.\r\nAngel Beats! takes place in a kind of afterlife similar to purgatory. In it, young adults find themselves at a mysterious colossal boarding school that runs like most other schools...with one exception; Yuri and the Afterlife battlefront.\r\nThe members of the Afterlife battlefront fight the unfairness of life and also their idealogy of god. Otonashi is the protagonist, after he wakes in the new world with little to no memories about his past life. This mayseem cliche, well, because it somewhat is but this works well as a plot device as his motives change because of his memories being slowly regained. \\n\\n\r\nAfter a long break from Anime this was the series that drew me back in. The mix of action and light-hearted comedy has it's subtle mesh and the Anime is brought together by some truly stirring musical pieces. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters of Otonashi and Yuri work well and the supporting characters are developed in a way that neither wastes time nor feels that they are felt 2D dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it is well worth watching. It comes bundled in a short and sweet 13 episode set and leaves you fulfilled.",

            "content": "This is my first review so I hope it helps! \r\nIf you haven't read the synopsis, Angel Beats (in a nutshell) takes place in a fictional world at a school where the protagonists are unable to advance to the afterlife/next life because of regret or lack of fulfillment in their previous life. There were lots of ups and downs to this series. I was really excited to start the series since it had been so heavily recommended to me by several friends, so I had high expectations prior to watching Angel Beats. Whether or not this affected my opinion is difficult to say, but Ifound myself disappointed and unmoved by the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I break the series down into categories, I'll say what stands out in this anime. The visuals and audio are captivating. They really compliment the characters and story. Out of all the anime I've seen, I'd place Angel Beats in the top 5 for visuals and the very top for audio. The topic of the afterlife is nothing new. The overall idea of Angel Beats is somewhat identical to Haibane Renmei (protagonists stuck in life after death, forgotten pasts, regret, friendship, pass to next life, happy times), but it is presented more uniquely than any anime of the same genre that I have seen. \\n\\n\r\nA show of such promise is subject to heavy criticism if that promise is not upheld and that was the case for me. I'll explain it in categories.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nI was really impressed with the first few episodes. They achieved the goal of getting me hooked to the story wanting to unravel the mystery of this world between the past and future as well as why and how the protagonists ended up there. The premise of the show wasn't beaming in uniqueness, but it was presented and built up in a very promising way. A little over halfway through the series is when I felt that the story started to fall apart. The closer I got to the last episodes the less I enjoyed the show to the point where I would only watch an episode every other day. At times, the story seemed a bit rushed and sloppy with the addition of underwhelming antagonists. The conclusion had me shaking my head because of a romance that was crammed into the last few episodes rather than developed throughout the series. Normally, I rejoice with a \"BOOYAH!\" when these moments finally occur. This ending left me nothing with more than confused and sad \"Booyah..?\" Maybe the story would have been better off without the last second romance. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed the visuals. The background, character designs, and animation were practically flawless in my opinion. I felt that the art made the setting and characters seem dream-like, which fits the show perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe music was outstanding. I will probably never say this about a show again, but the songs in this series were so catchy that I even downloaded some of them. The OP was good but what really caught my attention were the original soundtracks played throughout the show. For those of you familiar with LiSA or enjoy Sword Art Online's opening theme (sung by LiSA) than you might enjoy this show simply for the music because she is featured in some of the songs. I suppose the background music wasn't anything special, but it fit each situation appropriately.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nThe character development is a big reason I was disappointed by the show. The show features a wide variety of characters, all unique and entertaining in their own way. Some of the characters were explored fairly in depth where their pasts were exposed and state of mind shaped as the series progresses. However, many characters were left in the dark that I would have enjoyed being investigated more. I found the supporting characters to be more likeable than the main characters a lot of the time mostly because they were generally the center of the comic relief and source of character uniqueness. Even so, I felt all the characters, both main and supporting, made the show unique and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nAlthough I found many things wrong with this show, I couldn't help but love certain aspects.  Much of my enjoyment came from the soundtracks rather than the plot and it slowly deteriorated as the show progressed. There were also more soundtracks in the first half, which is also why I enjoyed it much more than the second half. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nAs I said before, I was disappointed at how the show concluded. I feel that the series would have been much better if it had been lengthened to 20+ episodes with enhanced character development and plot adjustments. The plot of the show proved to be very promising in the beginning and never achieved its full potential. Even with all of this said, I do not regret watching the series and would consider watching it again. This show may not be memorable for everyone, but I feel that just about anyone could enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, anyone who liked Haibane Renmei, Sword Art Online, or Clannad could probably appreciate this anime.\\n\\n\r\n Hope this helped!\\n",

            "content": "Angel Beats is a marvel, no, a monument of modern Japanese animation. It is a series that has no reason to exist other than to market off of otaku and has no merit to it at all. I guess you could say that this is the spiritual successor to Code Geass, except at least that shallow marketing machine of a series had a little substance to it.\r\nThe series is about Walking Cliche Male Protagonist, Haruhi with a Gun, and her sidekick Nagato with her Hair Grown Out. The names are long, but you'll remember them. Follow them on a pseudo-deep story about rebelling against theGods of Television and becoming the most popular thing on TV while exerting the least effort. A quest which they are failing at so far, as Senko no Night Raid has been beating them in the ratings. To be fair though, that show has the unfair advantage of being original.\\n\\n\r\nBut really, being popular is basically all there is to Angel Beats. It's what everything in the series is about. Every aspect of Angel Beats is geared toward that singular purpose.\\n\\n\r\nIts main characters are ripped straight from another popular show and its supporting cast is a band of archetypes. Its setting is an excuse to have well-animated action scenes to draw in those who like eye candy, but inexplicably shoehorns in a school for the sake of familiarity. It has concert scenes because they were well-received in other shows. It has comedic death and revival gags because another show was successful with it. Even the needless punctuation in its title is mooching off the success of something else.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not telling a story, nor is it doing much of anything except using a bunch of unrelated but trendy devices. It's a nightmarish monster of mismatched anime pop culture. It directly targets the lowest common denominator of anime fandom, and is barely succeeding. This is just sad.",

            "content": "Note: I ain't no english speaker\r\nWelcome to MAL where a mediocre and predictable tear-jerking/slice of life/ comedy series is ranked 100 spots over NGE. The magical place where fanboys will defend their favorite crappy anime just so a bunch of pretentious teenagers that think that they are intellectual can complain about their shitty taste and make fun of them (oh wai--)\r\nIf after reading that paragraph you are not quite sure what is my opinion about Angel Beats! then let's get down to the proper review.\r\nPRODUCTION VALUE\r\nI cannot bash this anime on this particular aspect as it has top-notch animation combined with beautiful art. It wasproduced by P. A. Works, a studio with tons of money that prefers to invest it in these mediocre melodramatic stories instead of something good (although wether or not it works for them from a business point of view is a different story). The atmosphere is pretty much the same you see in any anime of this genre with the exception that in this case everything is perfectly made. Even if there are some pretty terrible frames and a certain sense of money-saving at some points, the overall animation is well done with outstanding effects.\\n\r\nAs for the sound, the voice acting is pretty generic, although they certainly do know how to use effects. The soundtrack was surprisingly average. With the amount of music this anime uses (plus the fact that there's a rock band in it) it was absolutely marvelous that none of the songs were memorable. As for the opening it just flies over your head, and the ending is decent.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nAlright! Who's ready for some shit-storm?! The anime has some good ideas, I'll give it that. The whole thing of seeing how people spend the after-life and making fun out of death constantly is not something you see everyday. But really...a high-school? From all of the possible settings to choose they decide to develop these ideas in...a high-school? I mean just imagine the possibilities of working with such a premise and they decide to go with the safest and cheapest route, by combining teenagers, angst, melodrama, bad comedy, a little bit of action and...a high-school.\\n\r\nBut after all, being set in a high-school with angsty teenagers doesn't necessarily means it's bad, right? WRONG! I mean, sure it doesn't, but here the problem is that Angel Beats! is all over the place. The comedy is at times dark humour about how funny watching others die is, and then a light-hearted slice of life comedy. None of the themes brought to the table are properly developed nor answered. A massive amount of plot-holes that they keep adding just for the sake of...adding them. Cheap and bad melodrama that comes out of nowhere with absolutely no backdrop nor proper writing. Sometimes fast-paced action sometimes horrible slow-pacing. A group of teenagers that go to school, fight god, go to school, do shitty comedy, form a super-secret elite squad, AND THEY CHOOSE TO GO TO FUCKING SCHOOL.\\n\r\nThe story is a big mess of multiple things with no proper execution on any of them nor interesting outcomes, neither feels or laughs. Is just a big ball of things with the word \"MEH\" written all over it.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nI can describe Angel Beats!'s characters in three words: underdeveloped, uncharming and bland. All the characters have one or two aspects that reflect their personalities, thus all of them being one-dimensional boring and completely unrelatable. All of them with the exception of the MC Otonashi who totally LACKS any personality. He didn't have not a single aspect. He wasn't one-dimensional, he was zero-dimensional. I didn't like \"Your lie in April\" for many of the same reasons I didn't like this anime but at least that one knew how to build a f*cking great MC. In this case, our hero is totally overshadowed by the rest of the (plain and mediocre) cast.\\n\r\nThe characters all lack a backstory (except Otonashi, props for that) and their development is all thrown into a single episode instead of being built overtime like a proper series would do. That has to do with the fact that the show has many more characters than it needs and many more than it can handle.\\n\r\nAll in all, the cast is poorly designed, bad and surely doesn't provide anything to the already lackluster series.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\r\nThis turned out worse than I expected. I didn't know I hated this anime so much. But now to the real deal, did I enjoy Angel Beats!? No, definetly not. The premise was somewhat interesting and the production was great. But the combination of melodrama, bad comedy, ideas all over the place, frustrating situations, predictable outcomes, enraging plotholes and dreadful cast, totally killed any chance this anime had of being entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'll rewatch Clannad.",

            "content": "It seems to me that there are currently three major anime that are upheld by the vast majority of the anime community as \"the shows that bring tears\". I have heard all three of them described as life-changing masterpieces, stories that transcend genre and qualify as immaculate art. I am of course referring to Clannad & its Afterstory, Ano Hana or The Flower We Saw That Day, and... Angel Beats. While I have my gripes with the other two (Clannad's first season is mostly unnecessary and Ano Hana relies on characters showing emotion counting as invoking the emotion of the audience) I can accept andunderstand how these shows could have a profound impact on people as they earn their emotional moments by carefully developing their characters and setting up impacting scenes way in advance. Hell, Clannad Afterstory even worked on me: I was sobbing for hours. It didn't change my life, but it was a thoroughly fulfilling experience nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nWith Angel Beats though... It's time to bring down the hammer.\\n\\n\r\nI did not find the show to be impressive. It was actually one of the first shows I watched, so I was in a state of being easily impressed, and my first and foremost reaction to it was to forget about it. Nothing it did left a lasting impression on me, and few parts even made me think \"hey, I'd use that element if I was writing a story!\" It has any number of superficial issues that are enunciated by its brevity, and it never really comes together in any profound way to justify this. In fact, if I had to sum up what appears to make people believe that this is an emotional experience, it would be \"disjointed sad things happen while pretty music plays\". That's not really a review though, so lets get down to just about every problem I have with Angel Beats. WARNING: PLENTY OF SPOILERS AHEAD\\n\\n\r\nLets start with the superficial bits: the art and the sound. Both are fairly solid. The ending theme \"Brave\" in particular is absolutely gorgeous. The art style is crisp and the action sequences are clean and flashy. However, I don't really place a great amount of value on the art and music of a show unless they're used in clever or intentional ways to complement the story, so I'm not willing to give many points overall for these.\\n\\n\r\nNow on with the premise. We're in purgatory. \"Ahhh, that sounds quite interesting!\" you say. \"What's it like there? Is it a macabre bar, like in Death Parade? Perhaps a rural village trapped in perpetual sunset? A surreal forest full of fantastical twilight creatures? The possibilities are endless!\" Yes indeed they are endless, and so of course the setting of choice is a high school because f*ck it it's an anime. Granted, this is a purgatory for unfulfilled children, but that's really just a lame excuse to bring us back to everybody's favorite overdone milked-dry setting. So anyways, dead kids who died unhappy come here and are policed by a mysterious stone-faced girl with superhuman powers called Nagato... I mean Angel. When they find fulfillment and are at peace with themselves, they disappear and move on. Our protagonist, Yuzuru AKA red-hair, who earns his name for being a rare example of a cliche male protagonist who doesn't have bangs of luscious dark chocolate, arrives at the scene with no memory of anything (although there's an 11/10 chance its something ridiculously tragic that demonstrates how goddamn great of a guy he is... oh look, I was right) and meets Yuri, one of I-shit-you-not three girls with varying shades of purple hair. There's some convoluted and meaningless exposition, he joins a club she's president of because this is pretty much a high-school show anyways at this point, and then we are introduced to one of the show's largest problems:\\n\\n\r\nIts side characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere's about 75 of them and none of them serve any purpose. Some of them don't even seem capable of saying more than one line. What are these, Pokemon? Each of them embodies one or another anime archetype because the show seems to have this belief that it isn't making full use of its potential unless it has as many different archetypal characters as possible. This is of course with the exception of T.K, who also doesn't serve any purpose or have any depth but at least his eccentricity is original. Actually, he seems like kind of a f*cked up dude. The show might have been a lot better if it had actually delved more into his character. As if to drive home the point that none of these characters have any relevance whatsoever they all quite literally disappear between the second to last and last episodes. Yes, that's right, each and every one of these characters is written off by Yuri saying \"oh yeah they're gone now!\" and that's the end of it. GUESS YOU DIDN'T REALLY NEED THEM AFTERALL, HUH? This meaningless mass of cardboard-cutouts would actually have been a lot less detrimental to the story if it weren't for another major issue with the story:\\n\\n\r\nThe Pacing.\\n\\n\r\nThis show knows how to do two things: throw dramatic bilge at you like its trying to bury you, and have filler. It's like it's not conscious of the fact that emotional moments only have dramatic weight if you develop the characters involved beforehand. The first third of the series is devoted almost entirely to d*cking around with Yuri and her team of soulless archetypes pulling one stupid gag after another. It gives us little to no insight into who these people actually are when they're not sobbing over each other or recounting their dark past. They're just shticks in a gag-reel, waiting for their turn to pop up and give their one-liner that fits their assigned personality type. Even in the later episodes, any moment that the show is not spending trying to be emotional plays out like an episode of goddamn Lucky Star! No one has any normal conversations! It's like they're dummies on autopilot, waiting to be activated when they're needed to gaze up at the sky in melancholy remembrance of the actual f*cking human beings they might once have been. Is this their punishment for being sent to purgatory? Have they been stripped of their ability to have uncliche interactions? Have they been trapped in the sick game of some depraved puppetmaster, pulling the strings and ridding them of their free will? I've kind of moved on already, but I guess I should announce it:\\n\\n\r\nI'm talking about this show's characters.\\n\\n\r\nI get the impression that the way this show was made was that some dude watched a bunch of crappy anime and formed an impression of how he believe anime characters OUGHT to behave. Then, he stuck a bunch of sad backstories on to those characters and had them cry all the time to simulate emotional depth. Seriously, here's a breakdown of the ENTIRETY of Yuri's character\\n\r\n          - she's charismatic\\n\r\n          - she's apparently a good leader because we are told so, though this is never shown\\n\r\n          - she's got a villainous laugh\\n\r\n          - she watched her younger siblings get their f*cking brains blown out at point-blank range by burglars and feels responsible for it\\n\\n\r\nOh sorry, what was that last one? Yeah, why bother with actually demonstrating who the supposed female lead is as a person through interactions and screen time when we can just give her a REALLY F*CKED UP BACKSTORY to contrast her happy and lively personality and call it development! We still know nothing about her as an individual, but... TRAUMA! Bam! Character done! Let's move on to the next one! Let's see... We'll make her a cripple who the world crapped on so that she never got to do anything she wanted. I'm of course talking about Yui, another of the purple-haired girls (yes, they named two unrelated girls with similar hair colors Yuri and Yui) who's character is 100% pure, refined tsundere of the finest essence with absolutely no real personality until 'the episode where she is given a tragic-as-all-hell backstory and then disappears'. Aw, she seemed so lively and excited but there was really misery underneath! Contrast! Sorrow! How did we not see this coming!? Maybe it's because she was an vacant doll up until the moment the story decided to steer its attention to her. You just can't do that: you can't suddenly bring your characters to life when you need them, you need to characterize them whenever their onscreen or else it just feels like a bunch of actors who stop trying as soon as the spotlight isn't on them.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a problem that the show suffers from right up until its very end: its characters only start acting whenever the spotlight is swiveled to them. In the end, we're left with a cast of main characters mourning their inevitable separation from each other in a series of scenes that are on their own quite well-directed but have no impact because I have no attachment to this group of people. I've never gotten to see their dynamic outside of idiotic anime humor, and several of them barely have relationships with most of the members of the group. The show's inability to mellow out, to have its characters interact in meaningful ways and grow closer without sobbing on each other in short, sharp bursts seriously bites it in the ass, as it means that when it is willing to put in the effort to have solid scenes they just don't mean anything. One of the reasons that Clannad Afterstory worked so well was that the first two-thirds were mainly devoted to showing the beautifully simple yet honest daily lives of the characters and the complexities of their relationships with each other. That way I care about the characters before anything bad happens to them. No show should have to rely on tragedy in order to make you become invested in its characters. Sure, Clannad also spent plenty of time messing around but inevitably it didn't hurt it nearly as much because it was still long enough to do everything it needed to. Angel Beats does not have that length. It is a 1-cour show, and it had no time to spare. The fact that it wasted most of it was absolutely lethal.\\n\\n\r\nNo review of Angel Beats would be complete, however, without addressing the most obvious aspect of the show: Angel herself. Angel was definitely one of the more subtly done characters, and suffered the least from the spotlight effect. She developed at a fluid rate and was always given enough attention to maintain her relevance in the story. If the show had earned the right to be about anything, it would be her for sure, not red-hair and his quest to be the single most upstanding dude around and save everyone. His character is standard visual novel trash not even really worth talking about as he falls into all the same pitfalls as the other characters, hers at least possesses an element of uniqueness (at least within the show) and some goddamn flaws instead of just being the most sensitive kind person ever who happened to have unrealistically horrible things happen to her. She's meat-headed, misguided and not especially bright. She's terrible at conveying her emotions and connecting with people. Steadily, she learns about who she wants to be and how to form the relationships she wants to.\\n\\n\r\nBut obviously, this is not what happens. Angel's character instead inevitably becomes defined by red-hair and proves to exist simply to disappear in his arms for emotional impact. She is given some contrived plot-twist to connect him to her (\"My heart is yours by transplant!\") and this of course causes him to...\\n\\n\r\n...confess his love for her?\\n\\n\r\nExcuse me? These two have about as much chemistry as Argon and Neon: they don't react. Even more importantly, the amount of development they've had together is enough to establish them as acquaintances at best, with confessions of love being almost as ludacris as That Time Hinata Told Yui He'd Marry Her. I can only imagine that the creators either made it up in the moment or totally forgot about it until it was time for them to air it and just threw it in there like unfinished cookie-dough into an underheated oven. There's only one reason for this: so that red-hair can end the show by wailing his despair at being separated from his love-of-two-seconds.\\n\\n\r\nThat's her purpose? Poorly-simulated drama for the MC? The random shadow monsters were nonsensical, the massive purgatory fish was to be expected, but this was just... why? The best character is wasted, there's no weight to the situation because it's completely impulsive, and the after-credit scene undoes it anyways so what's even the point? \\n\\n\r\nOkay, I've done quite a bit of bashing. I haven't even touched on all the specifics, but I've hit all the problems that I feel are consistent and what's left is a show that really doesn't have too much to offer. That said though, I didn't hate it. It was bad storytelling: awfully executed, little understanding of characters; but it wasn't offensive, and it did have some good ideas, it just had no idea what to do with them. I certainly wouldn't recommend it, but I've seen worse. Regardless, Angel Beats is not a masterpiece and its unending attempts to make cheap emotional grabs did not impress me.",

            "content": "Short Review: It needed 26 episodes.\r\nLong Review: Angel Beats is a pretty interesting work. The writer, Jun Maeda, is responsible for a number of emotional masterpieces such as Air, Kanon, and Clannad.  Maeda's ability to invoke emotion in his audience is definitely outstanding and thus I had great anticipation for the series.\r\nAngel Beats! is a treat to the eyes and ears. P.A. works did an amazing job with the visuals. The opening animation is a pleasure to watch and the backgrounds can easily rival Kyoto Animation's which is no small feat. The music is also very memorable, and usually appropriate to the situation. Besidesthe opening \"My Soul Your Beats\" and \"Brave Song\", there's also a bunch of songs sung by the show's band Girls' Dead Monster. Some people have noted the songs by GDM sound a bit amateurish, but I think it's appropriate and gives the feel of a garage band trying to make it big.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story, however, is rather confusing and keeps shifting gears. We start out in a mysterious world of the afterlife and in  a place where not even the characters know what's going on. Naturally, a state of confusion would make sense-- except that most of the world is never really explored or explained. And the explanations we do get are often out of left field, and usually shoved in at the end of the episode. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the overall idea isn't bad at all; it's just that the accelerated pacing due to the 13 episodes and the fact that the anime seems to not be sure on where it's going. It just started too much threads.\\n\\n\r\nThe most jarring thing about the show is its inability to separate the comedy from the melodrama. It's often mixed together at the worst moments and becomes very cheesy.  The worst case of this is probably the character of Naoi, someone who should be interesting, but I wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry. Also, frequently the melodrama feels very forced and manipulative because it's just shoved in there-- you've gotta develop a conflict or issue for it to have any real impact.  This was especially true near the end. But Key fans don't worry, there's still some very  sweet moments even if it is very messy. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this, Angel Beats is still a very funny show. At first,the humor didn't click with me, but two words: Rocket Chairs. The silly antics of the protagonists group-- the SSS is fun and its enjoyable to see them do silly stuff like that in this world. And of course the character TK himself seems to steal the show every time he utters a line.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all a fun and likable bunch-- typical for Key. Sadly, a lot of them remained underdeveloped due to time constraints. The ones that they do focus on are very well done-- the amnesiac Otonashi, the competent commander Yuri who's not just another Haruhi, the reliable bro Hinata. The enigmatic Angel is also a decent character who explodes the cuteness meter. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Angel Beats is not a bad show, but it just feels underwhelming that with all the ingredients for success, the show couldn't make up its mind on what to do. Nevertheless, if you're bored and want a few laughs or a few heartwarming moments, you can check this out.",

But I digress, this anime is simply amazing. As to expect from Key and their history of making comedic, romantic tear jerker's, Angel beats does not dissapoint. While its not as romantic, well actually not romantic at all so far, as you would expect from the creators of Clannad, the storyline is downright addictive. If you pass on this, you're missing out on something huge. Although the storyline is its biggest factor the comedy is puregold. There was once an episode where I absolutely could not stop laughing. I spent one hour watching a 24 min anime b/c of my constant rewinding! The ending and opening music is  performed beautifully and the latter is one of those songs you can listen to a billion times and it never gets tired. Trust me this is an anime you cannot afford to pass up.",

            "content": "Angel Beats Review:\r\nPotential. That is exactly what this show was full of. Admittedly Angel Beats was indeed a good show that I really enjoyed watching. However, the show fell short of what I believe it could have achieved in a 24 episode season.\r\nStory 6/10:\r\nMy God the story. THE reason why this show had sooo much potential. Angel Beats is about a student named Yuzuru Otonashi who finds himself with amnesia and in some sort of purgatory in shape of a high school campus. After meeting \"Angel,\" Otonashi is convinced into joining SSS, where he and other students in purgatory fight off \"Angel\" to prevent obliteration.Let me tell that to you again, kids in purgatory are fighting off an angel to prevent themselves from moving on. If you aren't intrigued by that I am shocked. To top that off, there is a plot twist later on that completely changes the dynamic of the show. AND since the anime is from KEY, the makers of Clannad, Kanon, and Air, the usual addition of very strong character arcs is present as well. Now, many of you may be asking, \"if it has all these things, why is the story only 'enjoyable' to you?\" Well the answer in short is that it all felt very rushed. With only 13 episodes, the story progresses very rapidly and tends to skip many important events, expecting the viewer to assume they happened as they are watching. This time restriction also made the romantic element of the show seem completely out of place because the two major romances in the show seem completely random due to scarce evidence that any romance was even budding between any characters until their big confessions. I do applaud the creators though for somehow making Otonashi, Nakamura, Yui, and Iwasawa's short character arcs thrilling to watch.  With only 13 episodes there are just too many glaring flaws, plot holes, and important scenes (particularly the ending) feeling more out of place than dramatic.  With a 24 episode season I feel that the story could have been much more fleshed out in every aspect, making it a truly spectacular occurrence. But even with only 13 episodes it was still a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\r\nWow. The animation to this show was absolutely superb. One of the greatest art from technological standpoint. The only downsides were the lack of outfits for the characters, and the lack of varied locations. However, these flaws were necessary to the show's setting. Basically this show had top of the notch animation and will wow all those who watch it.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10:\\n\r\nOne of the main reasons this show stands out so much. The OP and EDs are fantastic pieces that fit the tone of the show perfectly. To add on to that, the characters in the show actually have a band named GDM that plays fantastic pieces on their own. Really the songs can even make scenes feel very emotional even though they are actually more contradictory and unecessary than emotional (particularly the ending). Like the art, Angel Beats is on another level with its music production. The voice acting isn't anything special however, not bad, but nothing really worth noting in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10:\\n\r\nI feel like some of the characters in this show have a good amount of fanboys and girls. I feel this because their designs, along with the superb animation make these characters have a very good look, although their personalities all were clearly lacking. I personally found most of the characters FAR too one dimensional. This is especially true with the very large ensemble of side characters that never seem to get any proper attention or development. With an uninteresting lead, and one dimensional characters, it usually spells trouble. However, the fantastic character arcs for four of the characters were so good that I really can't say the characters were anything worse than above average. These arcs were truly fantastic. However, because the majority of the cast was one dimensional, predictable, and lacked development, the overall score for the characters cannot really be too high. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10:\\n\r\nI really liked this show. Its story was very unique and drew me in and kept me wanting more until the end. However I found some of the characters annoying, and found the plot holes, extremely random and forced romance, and poor ending pretty annoying as well. I definitely had a good time watching this show, but its issues didn't go unnoticed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10:\\n\r\nFrom the first episode I was captivated by the unique storyline, and this captivation continued until the last episode. However, the show did feel very rushed to me, and the ending seemed completely outrageous to me due to the randomness of it, and how it completely contradicted an entire half of the season. The show also left too many unanswered questions that will most likely never be answered. Because of the lack of episodes I was unable to do what a truly great anime would get me to do, and that is to connect with the characters. It was able to for short powerful bursts in its small character flashbacks, but those alone were not enough for me to truly care about the characters in the long run. I know this review seems like a negative one, but I'm just trying to address these issues because I feel most people have either missed or ignored them. I did like Angel Beats a lot, but I can't help feeling that if the series were twice as long, most of its flaws would have been resolved, and it could have been brilliant, probably passing Kanon on the KEY rankings (Clannad, Kanon, Angel Beats and Air).\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\\n\r\nA unique show that was undeniably good, but could have been MUCH more.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Concept for the plot\\n\r\n+ Fantastic music\\n\r\n+ Beautiful animation\\n\r\n+ Character flashback arcs are amazing\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Execution of plot was inconsistent\\n\r\n- Romance felt very forced\\n\r\n- One dimensional characters\\n\r\n- Ending is suspect\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Angel Beats!, watch...\\n\r\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya:\\n\r\nIf you liked the earlier episodes of Angel Beats where they more or less just fuck around, then you will also like Haruhi Suzumiya. Both are funny and have unique concepts and are very enjoyable to watch.\\n\r\nClannad:\\n\r\nIf the latter part of the show appealed to you and were all aboard the feels train, then absolutely watch Clannad and Clannad ~After Story~ the saddest show known to mankind.\\n\\n\r\n7/10 - Good\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Yuzuru Otonashi has a problem.  He\u2019s just woken up on the ground outside of a strange school, to find out that his unconscious body has been guarded over by an even stranger girl wielding a gun that\u2019s bigger than she is, and the only thing he remembers is his name.  But before he can ask what the hell he drank last night, she explains that he\u2019s dead.  And she says this... while aiming her gun at another girl. She goes on to explain that this other girl, an apparent angel, is the mortal enemy of her and the group she leads... TheUnderworld Battlefront. Or the \u201cLike Hell I\u2019m Dead Battlefront,\u201d depending on what version you\u2019re watching.\\n\\n\r\nBelieving this story to be bat-shit crazy, and who could blame him, the boy shrugs off her story, and decides to approach the other girl, who echoes the first girl\u2019s claim that he\u2019s no longer among the living. He asks for proof, so without hesitation, she stabs him through the heart, killing him. He wakes up in bed later on, his bloodstained shirt serving as a definitive reminder that he\u2019s not in Kansas anymore.\\n\\n\r\nHe\u2019s not in Oz, either... Probably.  He\u2019s in some vaguely defined computer-based version of Purgatory where teenagers end up whenever they die unfulfilled. You can\u2019t die in this world no matter what happens to you, you can magically build inanimate objects out of dirt, and if you take school too seriously, you\u2019ll disappear. This is a lot of nonsense for our hero to take in, but it\u2019s all real, leaving him no choice but to take his circumstances at face value.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf the aesthetic of this series reminds you of famous Kyoto Animation titles such as Kanon, Air, and Clannad, you\u2019re not too far off...  Angel Beats was designed by the same people who created the original visual novels for those other shows.  That\u2019s where the comparison ends, however, as the animation was done by a company named PA Works...  It\u2019s a company that has a very small, but very impressive, production history.  True to form, Angel Beats is right at the top of my list of the most well produced anime I\u2019ve ever seen, and I\u2019m not just talking about the visuals.\\n\\n\r\nIf there has ever been an anime that I rushed to buy the soundtrack to, it\u2019s this one.  I haven\u2019t heard an anime soundtrack that was this beautiful since Bastard.  The compositions are diverse, inspired, and in many cases, you can tell exactly what scene a tune is from just by listening to it with your eyes closed.  It\u2019s that good, and it\u2019s that memorable.  The opening theme is probably one of the least skippable I\u2019ve ever seen, with a mind-blowing piano score set to our title character rocking out on that exact instrument.  The ending theme is also great, as it has a very melancholic tone, and the way it ties into it\u2019s video won\u2019t really be made clear until the end of the series.  But the heart and soul of the music...  As well as the heart and soul of this series in general...  Is the fictitious anime band Girls Dead monster, a pulse pounding rock band formed by a handful of the students.  This band has it\u2019s OWN separate soundtrack, and trust me, they deserve it.\\n\\n\r\nWhen talking about the animation, the comparison to Kyoto Animation must once again be brought up...  Angel Beats clearly had just as high a budget as the Kyo-Ani classics, with endlessly smooth and graceful movements from the characters and environment, but unlike most of those shows, it doesn\u2019t waste it\u2019s money on mundane slice of life activities...  Oh no, they do SO much more with it.  This show goes so all out with it\u2019s big, epic Sci-fi action moments, smoothly blending CG with traditional visuals, that it even puts the first season of Haruhi Suzumiya to shame.  Even the background characters...  AKA the NPCs...  Are well animated, and I\u2019ve seen a ton of shows that didn\u2019t bother to go that far.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters?  Well, I guess we should start with the title character.  Angel...  Or, as she comes to be known, Kanade Tachibana...  Is a very problematic character, as some of the greatest flaws in the series revolve around her.  She has a really unique motivation behind her actions, I\u2019ll give her that, but it doesn\u2019t make her a well written character.  I can\u2019t really delve too deep into my problems with her without going into some pretty heavy spoilers, so I\u2019ll be saving my comments about her for my much more liberal post about this series next week.  As for her co-star, Otonashi, well, I also have some mixed feelings about him...  He\u2019s not your typical Key lead, as he doesn\u2019t make a habit of getting involved in other peoples\u2019 problems, but he also doesn\u2019t really do anything else to make up for it...  Aside from commenting on the crazy things all the other characters do, his only role in the story is to form a relationship with Angel so he can pass on what she knows about this world to the Battlefront, but that wouldn\u2019t be an issue if she had ever just told them herself...  Which she totally cold have done at any time.  Having said that, the development of their relationship is one of the better aspects of the show, so I can\u2019t complain too much.\\n\\n\r\nYurippe Nakamura(The girl with the gun), on the other hand, is a very compelling character. She\u2019s active, she has clear motives supported by one of the cast\u2019s most hauntingly tragic backstories, and she\u2019s by far the only character who ever takes the initiative towards moving the story forward. She bears some similarities to Haruhi Suzumiya, both in her appearance and her attitude towards her followers, but she\u2019s also a much more reasonable and intelligent character than Haruhi ever was. She\u2019s strong and perceptive, and has quite possibly the best character arc in the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for our secondary characters, Hinata is the first person who really befriends Yuzuru, and the dynamic between them is pretty enjoyable, despite the forced \u201cBromance or Romance?\u201d jokes. He\u2019s constantly insisting that he\u2019s not gay, and in a flashback, he proves it by showing us how terrible a catcher he is.  Yui is the fast-talking air-head, and while her hyperactive and sometimes idiotic ways are a constant source of annoyance for Hinata, they do show a genuine affection for each other. Naoi makes for a pretty decent villain when he first appears, but after having his cruel ways changed by the power of fwiendship, he basically just becomes a constant gay joke that never gets a punch line. Iwasama is the original lead singer of Girls Dead Monster, and...  Well, despite only appearing in three episodes, you could write an entire paper on her.  In a good way.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast barely deserves to be mentioned, if at all. Oda and Shiina make for some good visual gags from time to time, and TK is one of the laziest character ideas I\u2019ve ever heard of. I\u2019d really like someone to explain to me why he\u2019s so popular.  Those three included, everybody in th supporting cast is pretty much an interchangeable gimmick with a human face.  You could swap any of them out with a girl who likes to skateboard while dressed like a crab, and nothing...  Absolutely nothing...  Would change as a result.\\n\\n\r\nUnlinigual as I am, I can\u2019t say too much about the Japanese dub...  Just that it sounded really, really good.  It\u2019s leagues better than the English dub, which was written by the infamous Stephen Foster, and yes, it stinks opf all his trademarked awfulness.  If you can stomach hearing an awkward line like \u201cI thought you were just some gun-toting girl or something\u201d and not switch languages, then you know less about how people talk than HE does.  He takes a lot of unfortunate liberties with the dialogue, he\u2019s probably solely responsible for the mispronunciation of the word \u2018suplex,\u2019 and it\u2019s just an awkward time to be had in general. I\u2019ll be honest, though, while I definitely noticed how bad the writing was, it didn\u2019t really piss me off until he rewrote one of my favorite Yurippe quotes near the end.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said all that, I can\u2019t condemn the dub  completely....  Like with most of Foster\u2019s work, the writing may be awful, but the acting overall is actually pretty decent.  Likewise, there were a few really impressive performances. Luci Christian is at the top of the class as usual. She\u2019s made a career out of being one of the best emoters in the business, and even though she only gets a single episode of screen time as Iwasama, she still lets her veteran instincts bleed through with every word. Hilary Haag puts her signature hyperactive energy into her role as Yui, forcing me to wonder just how versatile her insidiously high pitched voice can be. Brittney Karbowski owns the role of Yuri, and as I\u2019ve mentioned in previous reviews, she\u2019s always a joy to listen to. David Matranga takes the subtle, humorous edge that he gave to his character in the lead role from Clannad and carries it over to Hinata, to stunning effect.\\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s not all sunshine and rainbows...  Blake Shepherd is the flat out terrible lead role, and for the life of me, I can\u2019t wrap my head around why they trusted him with it. Emily Neves, in the role of Kanade... Um... Well, she doesn\u2019t do a bad job, it\u2019s just sort of mediocre. I mean, if you have three of the best voice actresses in the company in your cast, and give the \u2018lead role\u2019 to an actress who\u2019s career highlight at that point was getting booted off of American Idol, it\u2019s not a very flattering comparison. I would have placed this role in the hands of someone more capable, like Jessica Boone or Taylor Hannah, but to be fair, Emily\u2019s talent HAS grown by leaps and bounds since this role. And TK shouldn\u2019t have had an English voice actor at all, since his entire schtick is that he says nonsensical one-liners in Engrish.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I\u2019d recommend the sub, but if you\u2019re a hardcore dub fan, then the acting in the dub should at least be satisfactory.\\n\\n\r\nThe meat of Angel Beats can be difficult to talk about, so I think I\u2019ll open by saying it\u2019s an anime that you\u2019re supposed to watch with your heart, and not with your head.  It\u2019s full of intense passion, strong emotions, and just enough gripping characters so that any viewer will find at least one to relate to and root for.  The romantic melodrama and tear-jerking tragedy of this  mysterious world is designed to grab you right by the heart and hold on for dear life, because if it should ever fail to keep that part of you engaged, you brain would kick in, and you\u2019d notice right off the bat just how much of an unholy mess this story really is.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the first things Yuri tells Otonashi is that he should just go with it, and accept things as they are. I\u2019d like to think this advice goes double for the viewer... Turn your brain off, because this story doesn\u2019t make a lick of sense. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong here, a fictional story doesn\u2019t have to make sense to our universe. It has to make sense according to it\u2019s own universe. With nearly every single story element, we get an explanation of what it is, an explanation of how it works, and a direct contradiction within three episodes time.\\n\\n\r\nThere aren\u2019t a lot of examples I can give of this without dropping some spoilers...  Once again, tune in next week for that rant...  But you can take, for example, the Battlefront\u2019s attitude towards Angel.  In an early episode, Yuri explains that they have to be careful, and keep all conversations about their plans under wraps, because they don\u2019t know whether or not Angel can hear them.  Well, in only a few episodes time, they\u2019re nonchalantly discussing their plans right on the other side of the classroom from her...  She doesn\u2019t seem to notice, and for the most part, they don\u2019t seem worried that she\u2019ll notice.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd there are other examples... The other students who weren\u2019t brought here from another life are called NPC\u2019s, and while they\u2019re supposed to turn a blind eye to the Battlefront\u2019s antics, they show up in droves to a GirlDeMo concert, and line up for a monster fish meat give-away. The former of the two examples was pointed out by one of the characters... As a matter of fact, a lot of the inconsistencies in this show are pointed out by the characters, as if the writers thought that making the script self-aware of it\u2019s own flaws would somehow make up for those flaws.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of this anime is a serious issue. We get plot point after plot point after plot point thrown at us at break-neck speed, and with no build-up or development for any of them, they just fly by without making much of an impact. There\u2019s little to no character development outside of the main cast, and as a result, more than three quarters of the cast go completely unexplored, existing only to spout off their assigned one-note-jokes and occasionally die for our amusement. I strongly feel as though both of these problems could have been solved if the show had a 24-26 episode run, like it was initially supposed to.\\n\\n\r\nWe\u2019re introduced to important details that quickly become forgotten or conflicted, plot points that are almost immediately made pointless, and the only explanations they ever stick to are the ones that sound like complete cop-outs. The incomprehensible nature of the world they\u2019re in ultimately culminates with an underground scene between Yuri and some mysterious figure in a room full of computers. This is by far the most insulting moment in the entire series, as several of the questions we\u2019ve asked about it are resolved with lazy answers ranging from \u201cIt was like this when I got here\u201d to \u201cThe power of love.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAnd all of this culminates in a conclusion that\u2019s emotionally powerful, as well as a relentless tear jerker, but upon closer inspection is nothing but a clusterfuck of plotholes...  And no, i\u2019m not just talking about the one plothole that everybody knows about.  There are deeper, much more destructive plot holes that undermine the entire premise of the show, take the stakes completely out of the climactic final battle, and render the two strongest episodes completely pointless.  And once you\u2019ve realized them, they will probably make you feel like the biggest fool on earth for loving it as much as you did.  And even as someone who genuinely does enjoy the series, it just can\u2019t be forgiven for writing that lazy.\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats is available from Sentai Filmworks.  The DVD set has been out for a while, and it includes one of the few OVA episodes, which is worth a few good laughs.  The set set can be found for a modest sum on Ebay, and at the time of this writing, it\u2019s available for a bit cheaper as part of the Rightstuf.com December sale.  There are a handful of CD soundtracks that can also be purchased, and if nothing else,those are worth paying a pretty penny for.  There\u2019s apparently also a prequel light novel, but I haven\u2019t read it, because it hasn\u2019t been officially translated yet.  It\u2019s not available on Netflix anymore, but it IS still available on Crunchyroll.  And as long as you\u2019re a member, and don\u2019t have to put up with six commercials per episode, Crunchyroll\u2019s awesome.\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats is a very poorly written story that relies entirely on it\u2019s spectacular visuals to distract you from the phenomenal lack of logic or consistency. It works masterfully on an emotional level, and despite the messiness that you\u2019re supposed to overlook, it never feels hollow or meaningless... but the logical side of Angel Beats is just so infuriatingly bad.  It\u2019s easier to appreciate for what it isn\u2019t than for what it is, though..  It doesn\u2019t follow any clich\u00e9s throughout it\u2019s thirteen episode run, and none of it\u2019s characters fit into any of the tired stereotypes that plague the anime industry, so I\u2019m willing to give it some credit for originality and effort.  But the talent, overall, just isn\u2019t there.\\n\\n\r\nAnd do you want to know the absolute worst thing about it? The worst thing about this anime is that it is physically impossible to not enjoy it. It is relentlessly fun to watch, even for some stick-in-the-mud like me who kept his brain on full blast the entire time. There\u2019s a lot of things it does wrong... Embarrassingly so, at some points... But when it does something right, it knocks it right out of the park. The overly complicated plot comes with a surprisingly simple, albeit poorly constructed, story. The humor isn\u2019t as spot-on as it probably should be, but it\u2019s inspired enough to keep you laughing just often enough. If nothing else, you\u2019ll enjoy the hell out of the production values alone.  I give Angel Beats a 6/10.",

            "content": "Angel Beats is yet again another cross media collaboration between Key animation studios, and visual novel writer Jun Maeda. Together have worked on such projects like Air, Kanon, Clannad, and now Angel Beats. \r\nThe plot centers around Otonashi, a young man who wakes up in the middle of a school yard, with no recollection on how he got there or any memories of his past. He is then confronted by a girl holding a rather large gun, her name is Yuri, the leader of a organization called the SSS, a group devoted to fighting god and his angels. Confused by her offer, Otonashi declines anddecides to confront this 'angel', seeing how she appears to be a lonesome little girl. Unfortunately for Otonashi, this helpless little girl somehow manifests blades from her arms and stabs him. After waking up, again, but this time in a hospital. Yuri and the rest of the SSS reveal to him that they are actually stuck in purgatory, and how they can't really die within this world, but if they were to pass on, something Angel intends to make them do, they will reincarnate into another life. Yuri and the SSS rather not pass on, instead, they would rather fight against the god who destined them to have unreasonable lives and possibly reincarnate into water fleas. Otonashi agrees to join Yuri and her group, hoping to regain some recollection of his past and learn the mysteries of this new world. \\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats starts off with great promise, interesting concepts and likeable characters, but ultimately fails to live up to anyone's expectations. People put the blame on the fact that everything in this series is restricted to only 13 episodes. But personally, I put the blame on the writer Jun Maeda. His work in visual novels is quite apparent in this series, as it seems like he's only good at writing scenarios, not a straight linear storyline. A competent writer should find a way to string these characters and events in a organic matter, instead of turning it into a nice jumbled mess. \\n\\n\r\nEverything in the show feels episodic. It presents 'important' plot points and characters, but by the next episode, it disregards all previous plot points in favor for this new one. Rinse and repeat over the course of 13 episodes. As a example; the series also introduces a new villain about mid-way through the series, but over the course of a single episode he joins the SSS. Because of this, the story of Angel Beats feels aimless. It has no conflict, no resolution, doesn't center on a particular character or even a villain. Jun Maeda blames that he 'wrote too much' for Angel Beats, which is why it turned into a cross media project, but why couldn't he craft a storyline just for the anime, and leave everything else to the small series of light novels or the manga? \\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that does shine in this series is it's diverse cast of characters. Like I said earlier, they are all very likeable and surprisingly memorable. Even more so with a fan favorite called TK, a mysterious english speaking character who's constantly dancing. Because of this, the humor and interaction between the characters works really well, it makes for some enjoyable moments. But isn't it a little sad when the humor is more enjoyable than the drama in a supposedly 'character driven' series? \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the drama, it's nothing but forced. It's mostly used for the sake of making the viewer feel sad or a weak attempt to feel something for a otherwise unlikable character. This of course is done in a series of flashbacks into the character's lives, before their new lives in the SSS. Does it have any real impact on the storyline? No. Does it add anything to the characters? It does in a few cases, but not all. Most of the time you'll be wondering what was the entire point of that sequence, as it only serves as a weak selling point to feel empathy for the character. Which I hear is more apparent in Jun Maeda's other work such as 'Clannad', but I have yet to seen that series nor have interest in it. \\n\\n\r\nSomething I feel like I should point out is the finale, I won't reveal any spoilers, but it does start with a lick of promise and is touching in a sense, and it leaves on such a bittersweet note that could have left the viewer feeling satisfied with the conclusion. But there's a added scene after the ending credits that almost destroys everything the series is built around. Instead of teeing the story together, it just leaves you with more loose ends and questions. Now, there's a 'unaired' episode that will be included with the DVD and Blu-Ray release, but I doubt it will add much of anything to the ending. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Angel Beats has nice characters and good looking animation, but the episodic pacing and muddled story leaves the entire experience a little left to be desired. \\n\r\nI find it a little hard to recommend a series like Angel Beats, because of the reception for it seems to be quite mixed. People who are fans of Key's past works seem to enjoy the series, but think it's one of the weakest ones they produce yet. While people like me feel like it's one of the most underwhelming anime's to premiere this season. \\n\\n\r\nRating: \\n\r\n5/10 \\n\\n\r\nCheck out if the show somehow interests you, but don't expect much.",

            "content": "Firstly, I've heard that Angel Beats is best enjoyed by exploring its other media types as well (short stories, manga). However, I have neither the time nor urge to do so, and therefore this review is based solely on the anime series. Created by the same people who made Clannad and Kanon, many had high hopes for AB and I myself predicted that it would be nothing short of excellent. To be honest though, it did not entirely meet my expectations.\r\nThe first episode starts off strongly by introducing many ideas regarding the story, although a lot of things are left unexplained. However, as theseries progresses details are gradually revealed bit by bit. The setting of AB is a school that's part of the afterlife, and it's this mystery and intrigue which makes this anime quite appealing in the early episodes. Another interesting twist is that all the main characters are already dead, which opens up many opportunities for creating comedic situations. Throughout the series you'll encounter drama, comedy and a fair bit of action. Personally, I thought the drama (eg. flashbacks on how unfair life was for certain characters, which is why they won't accept their deaths) was most effective at telling a story such as this. I found that the strongest episodes were the ones which took the plot seriously and focussed on the drama aspect instead of the comedy. The comedy can make you laugh whenever it\u2019s done correctly, but too many jokes are rubbish and/or repetitive. At times, comedy is put in the wrong places and ruins the momentum of the anime, causing a sudden standstill to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is excellent in AB. The studio responsible is P.A. Works, who've also produced high quality animation for True Tears and Canaan. Character models look great, although some of the characters look similar to each other. The various action scenes in this series are done very well which makes the battles fluid and exciting to watch. Music concerts which take place in specific episodes are a visual treat and a great spectacle.  No complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is another one of this anime's strongest points, especially the theme songs. The opening is probably one of the best I've seen, with a soulful track accompanied by superb animation which changes slightly for each episode. The ending credits also changes as new characters are introduced and older ones disappear. The timing and choice of background music at certain moments are a big help in setting up the emotional scenes as well as the funniest parts. There's also a music band in the storyline who play insert songs (ranging from good to great ones) throughout a few episodes. The dialogue is okay and voice acting pretty decent. Together with the animation, this shows a lot of time/money was put into the production to makes its quality stand out.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a mixed bunch, and represent one of the weakest areas of this show. The protagonist, Otonashi, is quite bland at first because he's lost his memory and we know nothing of him, but he doesn\u2019t improve much throughout. There's Yuri, the leader of the SSS with a strong personality, and when you see a flashback of her life it's easy to understand why she wants to be a rebel in the afterlife. Her rival is Angel, a mysterious person who tries to deter the activities of the SSS group. With the exception of maybe two or three, the rest of the (reasonably large) supporting cast don't have much development and are only around to say a few lines and contribute to some comedy and fighting. Perhaps it would have helped if this anime was longer, like 26 episodes, to explain how more of them came to the afterlife and why they fight. I didn\u2019t judge the cast by their appearances, but by a combination of their personalities, backgrounds, significance to the plot and their interactions with the other members. Taking this into account, many characters in AB are largely forgettable and difficult to become emotionally attached to. Deep characters (main and supporting) are a must in an anime that relies heavily on mystery and drama, and in this aspect AB fails to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the major flaws of AB is the episode count. I\u2019ve seen anime which have done okay with only 13 episodes, such as Kino\u2019s Journey and Elfen Lied. Angel Beats, however, is not one of them. It doesn't help that as the story picks up in the final episodes new plot elements are introduced and existing ones are just dumped to the side or rushed to completion; this results in terrible pacing and leaves more questions than answers. Also, a lot of suspense and mystery is built up in the first half of AB, but the revelations and plot twists are far from massive. By the end of the series, we still only know the backgrounds of four or five of the cast. As I've mentioned, the drama is one of the things AB does very well, but when it's squeezed into an episode it can feel forced and unnecessary. It also doesn\u2019t help that some early episodes barely progress the plot and instead acts like filler material, with comedy being its main focus. I like comedy, and I'd welcome it in any series if it improves the entertainment, but not at the cost of other aspects. AB is already too short, and a lot of the \"funny\" dialogue/scenes could have been devoted instead to developing the plot/characters/drama further.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, there are some great ideas here, but it's a little frustrating when the fantastic production values (animation, music) of this anime aren\u2019t matched by the other areas of it (plot, characters, pacing). It has its fair share of flaws but also some great moments, so if you like the plot summary, or have enjoyed Key's other works, then give this series a try because a lot of people probably enjoyed it more than I did. Angel Beats is a good anime series, but I think that it had the potential to be so much better.\\n",

            "content": "All right, I need to come clean and say, this is probably one of the hardest reviews for me to write. Probably because it might seem like my scores don't justify what I'm actually saying.\r\nFirst of all, Angel Beats might be my favorite anime of all-time. Is it the best anime I've ever seen? From a storytelling point of view, probably not. I won't lie and admit it has its flaws. However, there is just something about this anime I found extremely enjoyable. So much so where I go back and say, \"flaws? What flaws?\"\r\nI guess I should just start with the story. Otonashi wakesup and finds himself on a school ground that he isn't familiar with next to a girl holding a sniper rifle. She informs him that he is dead and that they are fighting against Angel, a girl that also attends this school with supernatural powers. Otonashi reacts about how you'd expect him to...in that he doesn't believe her and then confronts Angel, only ends up getting killed again and wakes up in this school rebellion's base. Everything at that point is explained to him and he ends up joining this school's rebellion against Angel, even though he has no quarrel with her, in fact, if anything, is intrigued by this girl. I realize this is an extremely vague way of telling the story, but I do not want to spoil too much for the later events that happen in this series.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps I should begin with what I liked about this series. The primary thing I liked most about this series was the characters. It had probably the most likable cast of characters I have ever seen in an anime. Each character had their own personality quirk and it was interesting to see how they all interacted with each other. They shared their happy moments, their intense moments, and even their sad moments. Despite the horrific back stories that many of these characters have, it still felt like you could relate to the characters. That would be the second thing I liked most about this anime and that was the main characters' back stories. They were gritty, scary, heartfelt, you name every possible sad emotion, you could tie it to the back stories of many of this anime's characters. The one that stood out to me the most was Yui's back story as well as her story arc that was expanded upon in one episode. I can honestly say I have never cried so hard at an entire episode and I would say it had a lot to do with a relatability I had with Yui's situation in that episode. I would be ignorant not to mention the excellent animation and music within this anime. It was just fantastic. Many fans/reviewers that I see use this as one of the few bright spots about this anime...although, I'd say that it has a few more than they would say.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, this was a hard anime for me to review because it was one of the most enjoyable animes I have ever seen despite it having many flaws. One of the major flaws was the setting. I will admit, it was unique and it seems to cause quite a bit of confusion to what it actually is. I've seen it called heaven, a purgatory, a realm, etc. To be honest, calling it a purgatory seems to grind my gears. I have a very hard time calling it a purgatory since purgatory is supposed to be (according to my beliefs) a spaceless, empty void, which this world is not. However, its not Heaven or Hell either and it's not specifically explained throughout the anime as to what exactly this world is. If I had to make an extremely broad guess, I would guess it is similar to perhaps the Bosom of Abraham. The Bosom of Abraham has many definitions due to the belief system that you have, but according to mine, it is a place in Hell reserved for those who will ascend to Heaven, a place where you won't be punished for your sins in the pits of Hell, among my belief of that is where Jesus spent three days before rising to Heaven on Easter Sunday. Sorry for the Christian banter, but it was really the best way I could possibly put what this world was. All-in-all, what we know (or learn) about this world is that it is an afterlife of some sort and once the characters learn something about themselves or accept themselves, they disappear. Once they disappear, it isn't explained what exactly happens to them. While some would call that a flaw, I don't necessarily call it a flaw. I see it as more of \"you're seeing the world through more of a 1st person point of view rather than a 3rd person. You're sort of learning as the characters are learning. In essence, you don't know more than what the characters know. It makes for a rather intriguing dynamic. While I don't consider it to be a major flaw, I was still puzzled as to why there wasn't a definitive explanation at the conclusion to this anime. \\n\\n\r\nI would say another minor flaw to this anime was the backstory of Kanade Tachibana (Angel). While we get a vivid back story on Otonashi, Yuri, Yui, Ayato, Iwasawa, and a few other characters, Kanade, who was a major character got very little explanation to her back story. Considering she is one of the major characters, I found that odd but it did leave to mystique and mystery throughout about who she really is. In the end, it wasn't really explained which disappointed me a little, but not to the point where I'd call it a major flaw.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm just not sure what to think of Angel Beats because to say it is a flawless anime is incorrect. It does have flaws but what I liked about it was that the flaws did not retract from the overall experience. This anime was a fun experience that really did a great job of tying in several different emotional attributes. From comedy, to drama, to romance, to action, this anime has a little bit of everything and while many don't have the highest opinion of this anime, I found it to be absolutely fascinating. Definitely worth a watch.",

            "content": "You know, sometimes animes just really don't live up to my expectations. One of those animes would definitely have to be Angel Beats.\r\nFirst hearing about it, I thought it would be just amazing. I mean, everybody was making a huge deal about this thing, telling everyone everywhere how sad and amazing it was, how it was even better than Clannad: After Story. Now, of course, I had to try it. \r\nI really shouldn't have gotten my hopes up. Now, not to say that Angel beats was a bad anime, because it wasn't. But it really wasn't anything special.\r\nFirst off, we have the characters. Long storyshort, they were bad. Each and every one of them had no personality, was a complete, almost offending stereotype, was extremely, EXTREMELY similar to a character from another anime, or was a character that I've seen way too many times to the point that I know every single thing about them and they're not interesting at all. Plus, there were like 15 characters, and only around five or even less of them were actually important to the story. The others just sat around and did basically nothing. No, seriously, they didn't do ANYTHING. \\n\r\nOne character (I won't make an effort to remember or even look up his name, I don't care that much) even has a one or two episode arc that has NOTHING to do with the plot and tries desperately to cover up the fact that it is a huge filler. And right after his arc, he just joins the SSS Brigade like nothing's happened and is completely pushed off to join the already overflowing number of background characters that we know the names and possibly, if we're lucky, one personality trait of.\\n\r\nThough, I have to say, a few of the characters I really liked. *cough*Iwasawa*cough*\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art was great, actually. The style was nice, and they never got noticably lazy with anything. The fight scenes, though, were obviously not very well choreographed. The color pallet also seemed really cold to me, though it was probably something that only I noticed. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty good, too. The opening song was great and the ending song was amazing. Both the English and Japanese voice actors did nice jobs, too. \\n\\n\r\nThe story was what really flopped this anime. The plot sounds good; I mean, stuck in the afterlife, trying to fight this angel thing, with angsty regrets about your past life? Sounds like it would make a good story. But it was sad how horribly it was executed. \\n\r\nThe pacing was way off. They drag the unimportant parts on way too long, actually put some really unessecary filler into the story, and then end up completely rushing the important parts. And they did this to the extreme. Basically a whole 7 or more episodes is filler and extremely unimportant stuff. For a thirteen episode anime? That's a huge no-no. \\n\r\nRemember how I said I heard that this anime was sad and heartwarming? Well, it wasn't. At all. It didn't even come close to pulling any of the strings of my heart. And that brings me to my next point. Angel Beats never pulled ANY strings. It didn't do anything creative, anything different, ANYTHING that I've never seen before. They just fight and go on missions, eventually reaching an ending that everyone else said was sad but really wasn't at all. \\n\r\nI mean, seriously, they're in the AFTERLIFE, the writers can at least do something creative and put the idea to good use. But, no, what could have been a thought-provoking theme was ruined and wasted.\\n\\n\r\nDespite how it sounds, I did find a bit of enjoyment in this anime. Putting my feelings aside, it seems like most people who watched this anime actually did love it for some reason, so go ahead, give it a go. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is going to be a critical review of Angel Beats!, I'm going to tell you now. If you feel like you might get hurt from me criticizing your beloved anime, then continue reading; you need to see things from different perspectives.\r\nI started watching Angel Beats! about 2 months ago. I put it on hiatus after watching 1 episode, simply because it was quite boring and its premise was not made quite clear. However, after reading about how \"sad\" its ending is and how much you will \"feel emotionally\" after watching it, I decided to give Angel Beats! another chance. No spoilers, so don't worry.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is essentially a group of people who have led less-than-satisfactory lives before dying, and as such, they are stuck in a middle-ground between Earth and Salvation (Heaven). The plot of the anime consists of people trying to \"repay\" their \"debts\" that they accumulated during their lifetime. Once their debt is gone, they will feel relieved, and be able to attain salvation. So, simple plot. And there in lies the problem. Watching Angel Beats!, I was thoroughly bored with every single episode EXCEPT: 5,8, and 10. Only 3 episodes managed to entertain me. Those happen to be the episodes that had some sort of comedic element to them, which probably explains why I enjoyed them. \\n\\n\r\nEvery episode in Angel Beats! tries too hard to have some dark, ominous setting. It feels like you're watching some badass anime, but every once in a while the producers will pull a gag-joke and completely ruin the intensity of the anime. There was honestly nothing that caught my attention in this anime, INCLUDING the fight scenes. They seemed extremely obligatory, and served no purpose at all. At the end of all the fight scenes, no one ever dies. What the hell? \"That's the whole point. When people die in this middle-ground of an afterlife, they just get reborn.\" Okay, well congratulations. The producers have somehow managed to dig themselves in a hole, creating a situation in which their fight scenes are automatically meaningless.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, Angel Beats! was still a fun anime to watch. However, it failed to deliver. After realizing that its main plot was quite drab, I banked on the series' well-touted ending. I wanted to feel sad. I wanted to get emotional. Previous to this, I have watched AnoHana. That anime, other than its fairly interesting plot, had an INCREDIBLE ending that had me on the verge of tears. Needless to say, with Angel Beats!'s ending being called \"one of the biggest tear jerkers in anime\", I thought I might even cry this time.\\n\\n\r\nNope. All 12 episodes, I didn't feel a single shred of sadness.  Maybe the 13th (final) episode will deliver? I watch the 13th episode. It is now the 10 minute mark, and there has yet to be anything remotely emotional. Finally, at the 17 minute mark, the anime starts to produce a sense of sadness, all knit together with the emotional music and all. I'm watching this final scene play out, and after it's done, I'm apparently at the 22 minute mark. \"What the hell?\" were my exact thoughts. The entire series was quite boring, and the one thing that could've saved it all, BLEW IT. Angel Beats!'s ending wreaked very little emotion from me; the parting at the end was simply too sudden and there was no build-up to that moment. Honestly, after watching Angel Beats!, I was left feeling dissatisfied with both the plot and the ending. Neither element delivered. The only reason this show didn't get anything lower is because of its music and characters. TK and Yui really served as saving graces to make this show enjoyable. The opening, in particular, was absolutely phenomenal. It is definitely one of my favorite anime openings, in song and in lyrics. \\n\\n\r\nThere were some bright moments in this anime, even certain sections that really made me laugh out loud. However, Angel Beats! is \"fair\" at best; and for that, it gets a deserved rating.",

            "content": "Well, this is my first review.\r\nTo start, I would like to say that I'm a Clannad fan, it is my favourite anime.\r\nStory:\r\nThe pace for the first episode is pretty fast, and I like fast paced series. The pacing does slow down for the second episode though. At first, you think that the storyline is very shallow because of the relaxed tone of the first part of the first episode. But after viewing two episodes, you realize that the storyline is rather sentimental, and each character has his/her own troubles. You actually start wondering if the story can actually finish within 13 episodes, without rushing it.\r\nArt:\r\nI'ma sucker for good art, and the art of Angel Beats! is just awesome. It uses some 3D effects here and there, but it's not overwhelming like some of the new series (Durarara! for example). I don't mind Durarara! styled art, but I prefer traditional 2D art with 3D effects only where appropriate, and the art of Angel Beats! is just that. Though, I do have a few gripes about the character art, as with a couple of the newer series. For example, Yuri's knee socks look like they are made out of latex or rubber at times. Other than that, the art is nothing short of epic.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe voices of the characters are just right, the BGM is very well chosen, and the effects are very well chosen too. The OP and ED songs are just right for this series in my opinion. And the overall sound quality of the Mazui version is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing too new about characters; they are all pretty generic. Though, it is the first time that I've seen a smart-looking guy being a moron in reality. Angel is an interesting antagonist, though. It is still a bit too early in the series to actually take a good look at the characters in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely one of the most enjoyable series that I've seen all year. As expected of a Key VN adaption, there is a lot of humour mixed into a serious plot, just like Clannad. I enjoy it so much that I'm just watching the two episodes over and over again in anticipation for the 3rd one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series meets my expectations perfectly, and in my opinion deserves a 10/10.",

            "content": "Angel Beats is an amalgamation of many things, but the result is anything but good. A unique story, bountiful characters, an in-your-face soundtrack, and whatever else Angel Beats may have going for it is ruined by Jun Maeda's inability to write an actual cohesive plot.\r\nThe weakest link in Angel Beats is easily its story. The setting takes place in a \"high school of the dead\" of sorts. That is to say, everyone attending this school is already dead and it's an afterlife for teenagers with unfulfilled motives to either fulfill them or pass their classes. Doing so will move them on to what is presumedto be an actual afterlife of resounding peace.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also safe to assume that since they are already dead, they cannot actually die. Angel Beats really starts beating a dead horse over this one, because characters getting hurt and \"dying\" is its main source of comedy. By the time our main character figures out he's immortal he's already been killed 100+ times by his other classmates. I'm not one for slapstick comedy, but I can at least understand, since these characters are already dead and do not convincingly express lasting pain, that there is no comedic value in beating them up. Any tone of seriousness has already been rammed out of the window with a giant mallet, quite literally, in the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe real meat of the story begins with its equally terrible characters. Yuzuru Otonashi is our main character who wakes up with amnesia in this hostile new world. Hostile because it's inhabited by the dense, delusional, and dictatorial, Yuri Nakamura. Amnesia is also a good excuse to make your character a bland, self-insert character (it's not actually). And when he does regain his memory he evolves into a pathetic character that is malcontent with not being kind enough. And amazingly is still a bland, self-insert character.\\n\\n\r\nNakamura is simply the only reason this story has any plot at all, and not in a good way. She is recruiting high school students for her cult in order to kill another character in this story, nicknamed Tenshi (angel in Japanese). It's the first few minutes of this show that if you hadn't already realized that, since nobody can die, there is really no point in trying to kill someone and that this whole story is a mindless flop, then I have some bad news for you. Also Nakamura has a sweatshop of old men that she has trapped underground to build her her weapons and guns. Her backstory is also terribly unsound.\\n\\n\r\nTenshi is a super-powered goody-two-shoes trying to make sure everyone in the school passes. Possibly the best character development is done with her because she actually has an understandable motive for trying to get others to pass. In comparison, Nakamura is a really just a brat with a god complex and unaware that her actions are not allowing her fellow classmates to focus on the curriculum and move on to the afterlife.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of fellow classmates, there are a ton, and each with their own one-dimensional cliche traits. There's the American, somewhat like Billy Kane from KoF, except not like Billy Kane at all and the only thing he has going for him is whenever he speaks it's only a few words in English. The silent ninja girl who goes gaga and becomes utterly useless when something cute's involved. The smart guy that's good with computers. The strong guy in judo. The guy with no special traits. I hope you get the idea, the anime did not have enough time to develop the unimportant part of the cast, but I'm sure if it did it wouldn't advance their characters to more than their already singular dimensions. What they did have time for, though, were two sport episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAdding on to singular dimensions, the drama and romance lack any. Otonashi develops a love interest with a girl I won't name to avoid spoilers who he literally spends mere minutes with and the interest doesn't even speak 90% of the time. Maeda then makes a completely insulting effort trying to melodrama his way into your heart expecting you to fall for the \"tragic\" separation of the two.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening has a nice piano riff and is easily the most enjoyable song, but the rest of the Girls Dead Monster soundtrack is only decent with many tracks that sound very repetitive and gets old quick like Crow Song. Girls Dead Monster is the in-anime band composed of some of the female students. If anything great ever came out of the anime for having a band it's the lead vocalist, Iwasawa, having one of the better backgrounds to her character.\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats has a really nice and shiny art style. Contrasts between colors makes it reminiscent to staring into the Sun which makes it an unpleasant viewing experience if you choose to focus on how bright it is in certain episodes. Angel Beats can also boast very acceptable animation, but not much else.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, good art, decent music, distasteful slapstick can't save a poorly written, melodramatic story with bland, boring characters.\\n\r\n3/10 poor",

There, the dead are supposed to find peace and acceptance of their lives even if they died tragically too young and too unfairly. But a certain group of students is angry with God and refuses to go along with the program, and are punished repeatedly by a guardian angel. At times it is a bit difficult to follow the logic of the world this story takes place in, but eventually it becomes clearer.\r\nThe story has a lot of individual characters, and just whenyou begin to know and like some of the characters, that character makes peace with themselves and God over their lives, and vanishes into the afterlife. These are bittersweet moments in the story, and happen over and over again. At the end of the story, the final remaining students makes peace with themselves, God and the Guardian Angel and move on as well. Because the core plot is about grieving one's lost chance at life, it is a sad story. But it is full of exciting and humorous moments as the students fight their fates and work through their feelings.\\n\\n\r\nI have to give this one only 7/10 even though I enjoyed it quite a bit. The story logic is very tortured and seemed to change as the story moved along. Favorite characters disappeared just when you got to like them. Key romantic relationships were interrupted just when they were getting good. A great bittersweet story with a lot of emotion, but also with a lot of frustration for the viewer as well.",

While the anime lacks substance regarding the story and its cast is badly used, Angel Beats! still remained for me an enjoyable \r\nexperience.\r\n- Story \u2013\r\nAngel Beats! is set in the afterlife, which could also be seen as a purgatory. From the start, I have to admit that it was hard for me finding a story. The problem is that Angel Beats was transferring from humour to drama in the driest way possible. If most of the episode was relying on typical slapstick humour, the end would suddenly shift tothe cheapest drama possible. Now of course, Angel Beats! Found itself a meaning, but this toward the very end of the series. Toward the ending, while keeping itself more serious, the anime rushes the story so hard that it becomes a festival of plot twist and drama. Step aside the bad points; let\u2019s not forget that Angel Beats! is from a visual novel of Key, mostly known for their tear jerking moments. I have to admit that the drama feels very cheap, but I\u2019m someone who falls for this kind of trap and end up being affected by the kind of drama that Angel Beats! had to offer. This is pretty much limited to characters having a shit life in the past. In the end, the story didn\u2019t know what to be from the start. Having too much filler in between, there\u2019s a serious lack of substance in the story and many questions that had to be answered, weren\u2019t answered. Angel Beats! still manages to pull the sensible chords, and this actually very well. \\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a problem with Angel Beats! regarding its cast. Either the show has too much characters and is not focusing on the most important ones, or the show is simply too short. For having this much, Angel Beats! didn\u2019t have the benefit of a 26 episodes anime. Lots of characters, mostly the non-important ones, fall in an archetype and are only meant for comic relief or filling up the holes. There\u2019s only few moments where the anime is really focusing on the main cast. Yet, some side characters are somehow more developed than them. Looking at the main characters, there\u2019s either no originality at all or simply silly change of personality. Yuzuru is a mix of the shit life that Tomoya had and the lost of memories that Yuuichi suffered from. For Angel, she starts as your typical emotionless moe girl but then shift to the characters with lots of expression. And for Yuri, she\u2019s just another non-original female lead. However, even though the cast of Angel Beats! is bad, it doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t entertaining. Certainly not annoying or boring, Angel Beats! offers characters that are simple and fitting to the anime.\\n\\n\r\n-Art/Animation-\\n\\n\r\nNo doubt about it, Angel Beats! is yet another eye candy. Even though it\u2019s not perfect regarding the character design, the anime uses lots of CGI and shading to blow the viewer away, and it works very well. The problem though, is that I sometime had problem identifying characters that were too look- alike (Takametsu and Hinata for example). The animation is actually very fluid, which is expected from P.A.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound/music-\\n\\n\r\nThe highlight of the series is no doubt the music that Angel Beats! Used. Ranging from pop songs to acoustic songs and then to melodramatic songs, it is no doubt that the music is the main factor why the anime is a tear jerking one. The voice actors are also very good with their respective roles and there\u2019s absolutely no problem with them.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I did overly enjoyed Angel Beats! despite that the anime contains many obvious flaws. I believe that the show could\u2019ve benefit from being longer or having less filler. It may be the weakest one from Key, but it doesn\u2019t stop itself from being at least good.",

            "content": "Angel Beats! is an anime that has been debated time and time again. People either hate it or love it. As for me, well.....\r\nStory- Angel Beats! has an amazing setup with great potential to be something great, but it doesn't match it at all. It all has to do with one factor. There isn't enough episodes. This series needed at least 24 episode (I feel) to tell an amazing story. However due to the limited amount of episodes it was given, the pacing in the story is extremely rushed and skips around a bit. All in all though, I was still able to understand thestory and was given enough time to connect with the characters to some length. So the story was not too big of a flop.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The art was pretty amazing. The opening of the show pretty much shows the animation quality. It was very pleasing to look at. From the fighting scenes to the concert scenes to the heartbreaking/warming scenes it certainly helped set the mood for the scenes along with....\\n\\n\r\nSound- Lord Nelsons Trousers I Love This Soundtrack! First off the opening and ending songs are absolutely great. The opening \"My Soul, Your Beats\" is one of my favorite openings of all time. It does a great job showcasing the characters, animation quality, and what we will be seeing later on in the episode without spoiling much. The ending \"Brave Song\" may seem boring at first, but for those who get emotionally attached to the characters it honestly is a very powerful ending song. I won't say much more about this to avoid spoilers. All the other songs from Girls Dead Monster are pretty great too. One more song to mention is \"Ichiban no Takaramono\". My gosh this song is good without lyrics as it is with lyrics. It is a very powerful and emotional song and when it is set as background music it is very effective. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters- The characters of this show could have easily been the best thing about this show. The characters that get introduction and background are easily the best ones of the show. From Iwasawa to Yui to Yuri the characters that are developed with back stories are great. However, with the short amount of episodes and a lot of the characters, focus was shifted to the main character while the others were pushed aside. Which is fine, but the show needed more room for him to grow or to help other people grow. Kanade was one of my favorite characters however she never really got a proper back story scene or episode. Sure it's explained later on in the series, but they perhaps needed an actual flashback episode to help us feel what Kanade felt and the impact her past had one her. Due to that all the characters are in the afterlife, i would assume this would be one of the most important features in this anime, and while it's still pretty good... it could have been a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I won't lie, after watching this anime the first time I was in tears. It just seemed to click with me. The anime itself also made me laugh multiple times. It is pretty funny for the most part, but when it needs to be sentimental it can pull it off. However, when I watched it again and again I began to notice where the story or character developments were rushed for the sake of the plot, and it annoyed me a little bit. However, every time I watch it I still end up laughing and sometimes crying again. It is a pretty enjoyable anime and I like for that. The flaws don't really bug me and I enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and art are probably the best things about this anime, however it does not make up for its pretty noticeable flaws. While I want to give this show a better score, I can't. The story and characters are not good enough to do so. So even though it is not one the best anime , it still has its moments where I can sit back and enjoy it from time and time. Anyway Angel Beats! is a good anime that needed some more work done on it, but still turned out all right.\\n",

            "content": "Ahh sitting down my computer on this fine Halloween evening good ole Daimyo had a marvellous idea. Let\u2019s review a completely scary and terrifying anime. Now good ole Daimyo has seen his fair share of anime, both good and bad. But rarely does an anime completely terrify him as this one did. In fact after watching something as terrible as this I feel I will never be the same loveable person you\u2019ve all come to know and respect. But I did it all for you, yes it was for you the would be readers (actually it was for my ego) I poured my heart intothis series.  As you can see I\u2019m doing quite the job of pussyfooting around what we\u2019re actually going to review. I have a valid reason for this, currently I am sitting on my ass passing out Halloween candy to all the annoying kids who should be at home doing their homework on this miserable Sunday night, instead of barking(yes one kid barked) up my house for cheap sugary coated treats. So as you can see my temperament is quite disagreeable (I\u2019ll be fine after a couple prozacs).  But don\u2019t worry because of that you all get the honour of an extremely long and tedious review. In fact going by the rate I\u2019m typing this nonsense down I might even break my previous records. Hooray! Leaving that aside, I\u2019m sure all of you are familiar with the Harry Potter book and movie series by a certain JK Rowling (good because I\u2019m sure not). If you recall there was a character that was not to be named, yes because if you called this fiend by his name who knows what sort of unspeakable evil and atrocities could be committed. I feel just the same way with Jun Maeda and Key (oh shit I just named them) . Usually, when people discuss key/Maeda work\u2019s such as Clannad I tend to give them the evil eye or the hard flame. This is because first of all just by reading the synopsis I can immediately tell that this type of bilge is going to give me sprue. But you know so as to not appear as an ignorant asshat, I tell them that while I think the premise of the show is shit, I can\u2019t call the entire show shit until I get around and arsed to watching it. Well that is exactly what happened with Jun Maeda\u2019s Angel Beats, I kept bitching about how terrible it was until I finally got around to watching it. Did I get a sudden epiphany and do a complete 180 like some of the characters did in this show towards the end? No, but what I did see scared the holy crap out of me. \\n\\n\nStory 7/10\\n\nWoah where do I begin? What the hell just happened? What the hell is this? What the hell am I saying what the hell for?(It\u2019s actually Why the hell but I didn\u2019t want to combo break) Now usually when I review a series I just look at the synopsis edit it a bit(plagiarize) and add my own personal finesse to why I think it was awesome. Well, that\u2019s just it the story of Angel Beats was not awesome. From what I understood it involves teenagers who got sent to heaven and await reincarnation? (Sorry I put a question mark, I don\u2019t know where the hell they got sent, but thankfully neither does Jun Maeda.) Yes, here in this random dimension they get to temporarily experience the teenage fun they never had while they were still alive. (Just like Disney land without all the rodents!) I don\u2019t know about you, but I felt they missed out several integral parts of enjoying a complete teenage life. Where were the drugs, gang violence and sluts (debatable presence)?  You know the type of stuff that makes Hollywood orgasm dollars. But heh I guess to people in Japan being a teenager means playing baseball and just overall finding new ways to be a douchebag to everyone, and then growing up to buy used panties from dispensable machines, animating H-material and taking opium(or paint thinners) and then going to Roppongi for a Hot Saturday Night. But enough of my rambling we didn\u2019t really address why this story sucks. It\u2019s not only that it\u2019s extremely confusing, but it\u2019s also as if there are certain switches Key threw in there to evoke certain emotions from people. At times it was like they wanted you to laugh but I wasn\u2019t laughing. Other times it was like they wanted me to be sad but who would shed manri tears for a show like this. Maybe I\u2019m just a bad person(ahahahaha yea right)? So almost always my Key switches were off, I mean there were a couple times where my switches were half on mostly leaning towards the comedy side and especially when said scene involved a certain TK. But other than that I just felt myself waiting for time to pass and the next episode to air. I can say that towards the end the story seems to finally go at a decent pace and at least develop into something mediocre. Not to give any spoilers it\u2019s not that the ending was good or bad per say just that it wasn\u2019t as terrible as I thought it could be. Still it could not save itself from the atomic remains of what occurred before it. To be honest I was leaning towards giving this one a 6 (which was written down when I was drunk and writing this) but now I\u2019ll change it to a slightly more appealing 7/10.\\n\\n\nCharacters 6/10\\n\nI wish I could slightly save the characters the same way I saved the story (tbh nobody could completely save that story). Unfortunately, if you thought the story was all over the place with its convoluted ideas then the characters were fucking all around the world in 13 episodes. We just had a shitload of characters... scratch that a fuckton. As a result some were ok, a lot bad and the rest were just plain negligible. For the sake of my review (laziness) and not having to recall all the painful memories I had with the cast (excuses) I will only mention a couple that stuck out for me (bias). Ah first and foremost my favourite character TK. Hell he\u2019s the only reason you should stick around for this. He\u2019s by far the best and most underrated character in this series. Poor bastard only gets like what 2-3 lines per episode and that\u2019s if he\u2019s lucky. Also his Engrish really impressed me, and I found myself pumped every time he said that vintage anime line \u201cGet Chance and Luck\u201d. His dancing moves were just so fresh, if all weaboos were like TK just imagine how great the world would be. The next noticeable character is our traditional punk/yankii character Noda(had to search it up). He really talks like a yankii(which is awesome) but unfortunately, that\u2019s all he can do, talk. I think it\u2019s supposed to be for some sort of comedic effect, but every time he tries to act like a badass he fails. I almost feel sorry for him he has all the negatives of a delinquent (rude, loud mouthed, somewhat an idiot) but none of the benefits (i.e the ass kicking elements). I mean just imagine you\u2019re watching GTO and Onizuka couldn\u2019t kick anyone\u2019s ass, what we\u2019d get is a train wreck (Otonashi no!!!!) and that\u2019s essentially what his character is, a real mess. I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s supposed to be the lancer (though the main character seems to have enough gigolo\u2019s to satisfy his exotic needs) or just deadweight like the rest of cast. No in fact I pity you, I pity that your character was wasted on Key\u2019s works. Had you have been featured in another anime/manga much more manri you may have made a name for yourself.  OK now those of you who are still reading my review must be furious by now, I haven\u2019t talked about any of your favourite characters. Well if I did I could easily keep this going for 10+ pages of rants and complaints. But I have an obligation to at least comment (complain) about what I dubbed this show\u2019s \u201choly trinity\u201d. Otonashi-Kanade-Yuri. You really can\u2019t discuss (hate) this show without mentioning these 3 characters (at least not effectively). Well, where do I start? We have so much to discuss. Should we start with Otonashi\u2019s generic pseudo defender of justice image, self-righteous tendencies or poor taste in women? Hmm how about all of them at once, well ok then, sure why not. First of all Otonashi, donating your rotten organs right before your death doesn\u2019t make you a hero. Also it doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s like in your mind you\u2019re always the hero. You could be working with the evil (subjective) emotionless force that\u2019s been plotting against you for the majority of the show but still somehow end up being justice\u2019s crusader and falling in love at the same time. It wouldn\u2019t be so bad if you didn\u2019t take yourself so goddamn serious. But you always do always serious fucking business with you. It\u2019s like you feel if you don\u2019t help the people get obliterated they might die or something. Oh no wait it\u2019s the opposite they will disappear if you obliterate them.  Also what kind of man leaves all the fighting to the women; I\u2019ll tell you a pussy (you\u2019ll have to excuse my french). Otonashi is definitely the meddling father in this trinity. Next we have Yuri. Hmm whenever I see her I think about a show I saw several years ago, with almost the exact same character except executed in a better way. The name escapes me\u2026 I think the main character\u2019s name started with an H( Google Letter H Japanese) so we\u2019ll just abbreviate it to that. Yes indeed Yuri would be much better if she followed H\u2019s example. Don\u2019t ask me why that is but I tend to like titles involving women with H\u2019s in them better than those that don\u2019t have said H. I guess she would be the unholy spirit. Now this last one really bites my ass, and not like some cheap prostitute but more like an overpriced one that doesn\u2019t know its place. Kanade, this character was completely emotionless and not in the badass stoic Kenshiro way but more like I\u2019m getting raped but don\u2019t care type of way. However, for some strange (predictable) reason she\u2019s the most powerful person on the show. I mean who would suspect that the emo girl would end up being the strongest!? I was completely shocked, like honestly it catches me off guard in the same way a romance begins to develop in a shojo title. But she isn\u2019t just strong, she\u2019s inexplicably strong no she just goes ninja shit on all the other characters, abilities come out of her ass all while maintaining that composure. It gets even better when they customize her and turn her into her own Wing zero custom (minus buster canons).  Did I mention I really love angel beats characters? In this trinity she\u2019s the son\u2026er daughter for obvious heart sharing reasons.\\n\\n\nEnjoyment/Overall  6/10\\n\nWhile I did enjoy writing this review the actual show itself was not as enjoyable. In fact I would almost be inclined to say that I forced myself to watch it just so that I could write this review (precognition). It\u2019s almost as if I was destined to write about this show. That being said I made several points in my notebook that I did not mention in my review. This is obviously though to me surpassing the 2,000 word point (we did it guys!) but mostly because of once again laziness. Also I feel that by now I may have angered enough fans who actually read this entire review, so not much more needs to be said. This is review is probably off base, I mean the anime community doesn\u2019t really like to things in shades of gray (myself included) most people are always on one side of the extreme or the other. Unfortunately, it just so happened that the extreme (minority) of fans I represent dislike shows like Angel beats in general. Every time I tried to get into the show, it\u2019s almost as if the creators were determined to throw me off the horse. Take Yui for example a character I conveniently missed out in commentaries, completely annoying and un-necessary but said character is also completely loli. This means she not only gets her own romantic sub-plot she also gets an entire episode dedicated to developing her character. From the massive amount of characters to choose from why did it have to be her? Is Key/Maeda trying to show me that whatever I think I may like about this show isn\u2019t going to be touched upon further. But I feel I\u2019ve daunted and rambled on too much about this show.",

I get that almost every anime revolves around high schools but this was just bad. Also, why are there so many teenagers (there are only a couple of adults) ?

I will admit, the comedy was pretty great but not great enough to make up for the series' other flaws, like the sad parts.\\n\r\nI came in with high expectations but it didn't please me.

            "content": "My first review is for a series that I throughly enjoyed and despite its flaws consider a masterpiece.\r\nEven before Angel Beats! first aired it was alright under quite a bit of pressure and once it finally did, most would agree it didn't quite live up to that expectation.\r\nAnd I too would agree to that, many expected another show akin to Jun Maeda's other works, Clannad, Kanon, Air and instead we were presented with this unruly, disorganized, seemingly random story that is Angel Beats! and I enjoyed every minute of it.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nFrom the get go the story is intriguing. Starting off with that an all toofamiliar line, something along the lines of \"You are dead.\" Angel Beats! introduces you to an Afterlife in which young souls are fighting against the very God who controls it, and his Angel. \\n\\n\r\nEven though the story is interesting, the beginning is shaky and doesn't find it's ground for a few episodes. Even so, I felt the story had great potential and even though it once again didn't quite meet it's expectancy was still an overall enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nI for one love the artistic styling of the Key company, and Angel Beats! is a thrill to watch play out. The animation is sleek and enjoyable and riddle with many different styling's while still holding that Key charm.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nLike the art, the music is outstanding. Properly used insert songs at key moments really make you feel what you need to during any scene. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nLike the story, I felt the characters were not used to there full potential. There has been many who have said the main characters in particular resemble one other famous duo, who I shouldn't have to name, but even so I do not think that takes away from there charm. Part of the loss in character development is just the sheer amount of appealing characters and lack of time to learn about each one. Nonetheless the characters are easy to relate too and definitely appealing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall: 10/10\\n\r\nAs I said at the beginning, Angel Beats! is definitely not without's flaws. The story while ending nicely had a rough time getting to that point, and at some points almost seems to forget it all together. The cast of characters are all interesting but some lack development. But in the end, Angel Beats! was a show worth watching. Full of laughs, sorrow, hardship and love, Angel Beats! will not disappoint.\\n",

            "content": "So, this is my first review and I just want to say, thanks to whoever reads this. Well first off, Angel  Beats! is currently my number one anime and I have fallen in love with everything about it. \r\nStory: I absolutely love the story and I think it is very unique how everyone starts off dead instead of living. Even if some of the episodes are filler and not important to the main story, they still add a lot of feel to it. 10/10\r\nArt: The art was among the best I have seen in any anime. The water in the river to the waythe sun was setting. The characters were drawn very well and were very detailed. Everything was done beautifully and was very crisp 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: I thought everything about the sound was great. Girls Dead Monster performed some amazing songs throughout the series and all of their songs were upbeat and brought a cheerful mood to the plot. The opening and ending were very good too. The opening was more of a happy toned song where I felt the ending song was slow paced and made me a little sad. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: In a 13 episode anime, we get introduced to a lot of characters. The only complaint I have about Angel Beats! Is the slight lack of character development. Out of all the characters we see, only about 4 or 5 are developed well enough for a 13 episode anime.The other characters were just in there. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This show was very enjoyable for me and for all my friends who I have gotten to watch this show (witch is 3 at the moment). I never regret watching this series and as corny as this sounds, it really made me think that \"life is worth living\" and has honestly changed the way I act. There were no boring parts in any episode and drew me in within the first 45 seconds. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I love this show and most of the people who watch it also do too. It quickly evolves from a funny and comedic show to a dramatic and heartwarming one. I STRONGLY recommend Angel Beats! to anyone. 10/10 Overall. I truly love this series. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this and enjoy the rest of your day ^-^",

            "content": "I downloaded this series after looking at my anime recommendations. I must admit, the first two episodes made me watch the whole thing [it's only 13 episodes though] in just one night.\r\nSTORY : 8/10. Although I understood the whole story, it only happened after watching the last episode. The plot was too rushed to fit into only thirteen 25-minute episodes, thus not all backstories are told. Still, I loved the story of every episode, especially with Yui and Hinata and it made me cry. Yeah, I hoped that everybody's backstory (especially TK's! :D) were told before they have passed on.\r\nART: 10/10. The anime was beautifullydrawn. And the lighting's good. The animation is also good, especially Operation: Tornado, where Girls DeMo performed.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10/10. The OP (My Soul, Your Beats!), ED1 (Brave Song), and ED2 (Ichiban no Takaramono) were awesome! I love Girls Dead Monster a lot, I even downloaded their whole album. The piano and orgel versions of Ichiban were also good. BTW, Ichiban no Takaramono made me cry buckets.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9/10. I loved everyone of them, especially Kanade. Her development was evident throughout the whole anime, from being a foe to an ally. Otonashi was one of the good-humored anime characters that I've known, and his backstory touched my heart. :)\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9/10. There were a LOT of funny moments, and at the same time, some tearjerkers. The series tugged into my heartstrings, and made me realize that being alive is awesome!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10. This anime will steal your hearts :) And enjoy!",

            "content": "This review contains no explicit spoilers. If you're the kind of person that doesn't appreciate even the slightest hint or foreshadowing then avoid reading this.\r\nThe story starts when our main character, Otonashi Yuzuru, wakes up in what seems to be a high school... but is in reality the afterlife. There, a bunch of students, led by an obnoxious girl, have formed a club to rebel against God. Their reason? the rather cruel and unfair way in which each of them passed away in the real world. As long as they rebel, they will not pass away for good in the afterlife, and so they decideto keep doing their thing. \\n\\n\r\nIt is also worth noting that this is a KEY adaptation of sorts. So obviously the main character has amnesia. Never gets old.\\n\\n\r\nI will forever say that Angel Beats! had the potential to become one of the best anime shows of all time. However, something went horribly wrong in the process, and what I was left with is nothing more than a mix of overused tropes with very little redeeming factors. \\n\\n\r\nSo what is this thing that went wrong? \\n\\n\r\nPretty simple: Angel Beats! should've been a 2 cour show (22-26 episodes).\\n\\n\r\nMany animes can pull a believable story with endearing, well developed characters in 13 episodes, but AB! isn't one of those. I wish I could keep going on about how amazing this ride could have been, but sadly I must rate this anime for what it is. That's not to say that the plot is perfect, because some concepts are pretty silly and devoid of logic, but still easily overlooked had the overall story been properly executed.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the very beginning we're introduced to the fact that in this afterlife people cannot truly die, a fact that doesn't stop our beloved SSS (the name of the club rebelling against anything God-related) from constantly shooting and opening gun fire against Angel (student council president IIRC), who in their opinion is their enemy... wait what? Yes, they have access to an arsenal of weapons crafted underground, for some reason. Like that, there are many factors in this show that don't really make sense, but it's alright, stuff doesn't have to be 100% reasonable in this fictional and weird high school setting, right?\\n\\n\r\nWhat is actually unforgivable is the terrible pacing and overall pointlessness of the story. It's supposed to be a SoL but it happens to be overloaded of other disposable mini events. Music, fishing, fighting, superpowers, pc programs, etc. are among some of those. There never seems to be a clear focus on where the story is headed, repeatedly switching back and forth, dropping relevant plot points to start new ones. It's not advised to do that if you only have 13 episodes at your avail.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have the extremely poor and rushed character development (if present). The SSS has easily more than 15 actual characters, with a focus on maybe 5 or so. Why? Outside the main characters, there's the violent guy, the calm guy, the mysterious girl, the geek, the weird one that says random stuff in english... yes, that's as memorable as they get. The main ones are \"lucky\" enough to have a semi-proper backstory composed of lazy flashbacks, but what about everyone else? They're just living tropes with no real input in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe humor is a hit or miss. Most of it relies on the repetition of the same jokes, so if they didn't stick on you at first, then you'll likely end up cringing at them.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, a few plot twists deprived of any build-up or character development, and a few illogical ass-pulls later, the show ends. I can see how some people might have been severely moved by it, but I could not help but shake my head in disbelief.\\n\\n\r\nLike with most overrated shows, the art and sound are usually really damn good, and in this case it's no exception. Animation, character designs and backgrounds are nothing short of amazing. The same can be said about the voice acting and music, with the insert songs being great and the OP / ED just magnificent (especially the OP).\\n\\n\r\nA shame that art and sound will never be enough on their own...\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nGeneral: \\n\r\nAtmosphere 5/10 --- Nothing made it look like this was the afterlife.\\n\r\nCharacters  3/10 --- Even the few that got development are average at best, especially the SSS leader aka Haruhi ripoff.\\n\r\nStory development & ending 4/10 --- Focus and pacing all over the place, ending with a senseless twist.\\n\\n\r\nTechnical:\\n\r\nArt 9/10 --- It's PA works.\\n\r\nSoundtrack 9/10 --- Really good!\\n\r\nVoice acting 9/10 --- No complaints. I'm a bit biased because Kana Hanazawa is here too.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal:\\n\r\nPriority (How eager I was to watch the next episode) 7/10 --- Okay hype.\\n\r\nMemorability 8/10 --- Hard to forget the anime that I'm pretty sure has the most reviews in this site.\\n\\n\r\nFinal score:\\n\r\n5/10 --- Mediocre\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nMost of the glaring issues could have been fixed if this had 22-26 episodes. I can just imagine each (or at least 90%) of the characters having a proper backstory and closure, as opposed to just 5. Would have also helped greatly in making the mini-arcs seem as something brief, instead of them taking 25-33% of the entire run time. \\n\\n\r\nThis was one of the first animes that I watched, and even so I could still not get captivated by it, when my taste was only starting to take shape. I apologize if some fact might be wrong, it's been more than 2 years since I watched this!\\n\\n\r\nRecommended audience: There's 0 fanservice, only some blood and the plot isn't really complex so this should be pretty easy to watch for any age 12+\\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed this review!\\n\\n\r\nPS: I have not watched any of the OVA or whatever Starway to heaven is.",

And with that, we have Angel Beats in our ranks. Adapted from a well-known Visual Novel, the anime was a great blockbuster in its era and bring a massive effect to the anime community, many fans blinded by the series charm. But how about the story itself? Is it as brilliant as the story concept? \r\nStory:  6/10\r\n     Angel Beats! simply has a unique concept, set in a mysterious worldwhere known as the \"afterlife\".

But there's only one fatal problem that spooked the whole story. Yes, the pacing.\\n\r\nIt's just forced to quickly finished. The plot's a little bit rushed.

            "content": "Angel Beats! was hyped up long before it was released.  Everyone expected it to be the new Kanon or Clannad.  Everyone expected Key to pull out some more of their brilliance, and I think its safe to say that we (myself included) were all disappointed with the first couple of episodes.  It continued to show glimpses of signature Key emotion, but at the end of each episode I was left unsure about where the plot was going.  I kept asking \"What is Key planning to do with this story?\"  Yet, despite my concerns, I decided to keep watching because ofKey's past track record, and I am now very glad that I did.\\n\\n\r\nThe story initially seems to have no direction.  In a world after death the amnesic main character Otonashi teams up with the Yuri and the Shinda Sekai Sensen to fight against the God who made their lives so miserable.  The idea has a lot of potential, but it initially seems to squander it.  There's a lot of random fighting without any purpose and details into each character's past are provided intermittently.  There are parts that are brilliant, but there are also parts that are seemingly unnecessary and mediocre.  The comedic scenes are genuinely funny, but there is not enough drama or suspense.  But this all changes after about episode 9.  Until this episode the tear-jerking dramatic style that Key has become famous for was lacking; only really seen in a handful of scenes prior.  Nine episodes in the story reaches a turning point that completely changes your perception of this anime.  The signature Key style comes to the fore again, and all the purpose of all the previous randomness becomes clear - to provide the foundation for the second half of the series.  Overall it starts off slow, but the story improves notably and can only be fully appreciated 9 or 10 episodes in, at which point I looked back on the episodes that came before and thought: \"Well now that I think about it, it was actually alright.\"  The conclusion was also stunning.  However, I still maintain that 13 episodes is much too short of a time frame for this series; it's very progressive and hence the pacing seems a bit awkward.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is brilliant overall.  This is another anime that uses 2-D CGI and you can clearly see the difference it makes during the fight and concert scenes.  The characters' movements are fluid and the lighting effects used are masterful.  The character designs are simple yet elegant.\\n\\n\r\nSound is the main strength of Angel Beats!.  Jun Maeda's compositions are outstanding, and again he delivers.  This series has one of the best OST's I have ever heard in an anime.  The music is emotional and complex, with soaring highs and depressing lows.  Only one word can describe this soundtrack - EPIC.  On top of that the voice actors also do a very good job, especially during emotional scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSome say that character-wise the show is somewhat lacking but I disagree.  Yes, character development is the weak point of this anime, but it is still present.  You do tend to get a feeling for each character's personality as you watch the series, even if it is not through any meaningful dialogue or feature.  The problem is simple - there are too many characters and too little episodes.  There are quite a few characters that are present merely for comic relief.  However, the characters that are explored to some depth are very well constructed.  Later on it starts to explore the characters' pasts in more detail including Otonashi, who's story is is particularly touching.\\n\\n\r\nIs this anime enjoyable?  I would have to say it is, but this is a point that will divide many viewers.  As tempting as it is, we shouldn't group this with Clannad, Kanon and Air.  It is clear that Key were trying to go down a whole different path with this anime, and all things considered they've done quite a good job of it.  Its flaws are many, but if anything these flaws give its its unique feel.  Overall Angel Beats! has divided rather than conquered, but it has managed to evolve into something that I would have never expected when I started watching.  This anime has to be given time to reach its full potential.  Good things come to those who wait.  Overall score: 8.6/10 (rounded to 9).",

            "content": "I came to AB! expecting a tearjerker, but too often I felt that what I was being asked to feel was too shallow or cheap. I don't like the feeling of being 'worked' by an author, whether it's anime or something else. One of the things that I think AB! really suffers from is the demand for immediate empathy, handing you tragic backstory after tragic backstory. At its best, I think this show does well bordering the line between a baseline sense of tragedy and the sort of sweet, silly or absurd situations that could arise with a bunch of pissed-off young people living inan eternal high school. At worst, it's messy and confusing as it sidelines worldbuilding and character depth for one-off action episodes and overwrought emotional conflicts. \\n\\n\r\nThe basic premise - the unsure do-gooder caught in a conflict and world he doesn't understand - has a lot of potential. The eerie shots of empty classrooms and the endless repetition of this sort of nether-world are enigmatic and may delight the curious - but to claim, as the summary on this site does, that this is a story unraveling 'the mystery of the afterlife' misses the mark a bit. For the bulk of the show, and where it's at its best, it's primarily an episodic, slice-of-life story about unhappy characters rebelling against meaningless suffering and a faceless higher power through simple antics. It's the bonds that form between these characters, and their growth as characters, that form the strongest element of the show and the one that may have you in the tears you've been promised by the end. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, these characters are skating on the rather thin ice of the world they find themselves in - it also doesn't help that for all the stronger, interesting characters, they're also loaded down with the predictable cast of tropes that add a few laughs but exist by and large to shoot a gun, drop a quip or two, and then disappear. By the end, the 'unraveling' that we've done leads to more questions than answers about the world in which they exist.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show has a tendency of taking itself too seriously, I enjoyed watching these characters interact most of the time, and they'll be what sticks with you after you've wrapped up your time in this very strange world. When they're being playful there are some very funny moments, giving rise to situations with just the right mix of sweetness and sadness that I felt most deeply in watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nDon't come to this expecting a masterpiece, but if you take it for what it is, it's probably worth the 6.5 hours.",

            "content": "I rewrote one of my old reviews. Now with 30% less pointless rambling and random literary allusions. Yes, I really rated Angel Beats a 9/10. You read that correctly. I don't give a F#!K what the hivemind of automatons on /a/ say about how much this series sucks.\r\nOverview:\r\nIt is often said that there is no room left for new stories. Indeed we have been telling stories for so long that most popular stories are simply slight variations of previous ones. Comedies are especially susceptible to plot recycling and are generally the least creative in terms of plot across all genres. Even Shakespeare himself couldn't bebothered to create a new plot for each comedy, so he used the same formula and basic plot outline again and again. What does any of this have to do with Angel Beats?! Angel Beats is a comedy that actually has a fairly unique plot that really isn't like anything else I have ever seen before! This is an extreme rarity and took me entirely by surprise. Now lets look at one of the more uniquely odd comedies to come out in recent years!\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with our main hero Otanashi waking up in a strange new world. High school aged children are fighting with weapons against a powerful figure that is called \"angel\". These children are all dead and seem to be stuck in a bizarre sort of purgatory that resembles a school. The group's leader is the feisty and short tempered Yurippe, who believes that they are engaged in a battle with a cruel and spiteful God. Yurippe believes this mysterious white haired girl is an angel and messenger of God, so she convinces everyone to fight the angel in order to spite God. This story has a LOT of twists and I won't spoil anything here. You will just have to check it out. What I will say is that some might be put off by the break neck swing between zany comedy and heavy handed tragedy. You thought Elfen Lied was bad about that? haha. To quote Bender from The Breakfast Club, \"Not...Even...CLOSE!\" That is my only real criticism.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAngel beats has a large class of amusing characters, but sadly many of them aren't given any back story or fleshing out. I wanted to see back stories for fan favorites like TK and Hayashida the 5th damn it! Other characters like Iwasawa are given back story that actually makes them interesting, only to disappear from the series immediately afterwards. I will admit that some of the characters like our main man Otanashi are a bit generic, but this IS a comedy after all. The series has already well exceeded the quota for creativity in a comedy. A couple generic characters doesn't take major points off in my book. It also must be said that all the character backstories are very tragic and \"forced\" if you will, but the that is kind of the whole point! Angel Beats isn't attempting to capture perfect realism. It is showing the strange and wonderful afterlife of a bunch of kids that lived horrible lives on Earth.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art offers breathtaking visuals, good character designs, and fluid energy that helps with the show's frantic comedy.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack includes not only a beautiful opening theme played on piano but plenty of emotional and honestly quite pretty songs to help strengthen the tone of the many tear jerking scenes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI could see why others might not like it with the extreme tone shifts and heavy handed tragedy, but I honestly enjoyed this one. It was funny, touching, creative, and overall a good experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSo you probably guessed that I like this series quite a bit, flaws and all. I wouldn't rate it perfect though, because no matter how much I like it, I think it had a lot of things it could have done better. I will give it a very close but not quite perfect: 9/10.",

            "content": "Anyone who's been to an sensational rock concert can tell you how easy it is to lose yourself in a wave of music. Anyone who's ever lost an old friend can tell you how hard it is to say goodbye too soon. And anyone who's ever been to public school already knows the value of a little recreational delinquency. Angel beats tries to mix themes such as these alongside more than a handful of different genres/styles. For only 13 episodes, it has nothing if not ambition. \r\nAs a result, Angel Beats is very unique in that, when it does so well, it can aspire tothe heights of not just one but many different kinds of anime. The strongest of these is the music. Holy crap the music. Words can't come close to the spirit even the shortest clips bring to the show. If you're at all curious, find a recording of the OP (My Soul, Your Beats) to get a good idea. What seals it to a ten, though, is the in-show girl band Girl's Dead Monster, which goes far beyond functioning what could have been just a minor plot device. Each concert is exquisite; the full album that was recently released is proof in itself. \\n\\n\r\nArtistically, Angel Beats leaves very little to be desired. Character designs, while largely stock material, go through a few unexpected changes. Combat is fast-paced, fluid and intense. When the rare occasion for artistic locations crops up, the animation does not disappoint. \\n\\n\r\nThose stock characters aren't really bad, just a necessity of having three main characters alongside a supporting cast of about 16 in such a short series. The show does better and better to develop backstory, weave relationships and the like as time goes on. These stories range from what you'd expect in a series set in purgatory - i.e., everyone regrets something - to the surprisingly personal. One really wonders how the expanded cast could have been utilized if the plot didn't force the show onward in the last two or three episodes. Still, anyone can find a favorite student to watch - and that's not even taking into account the awesomeness that is TK. Don't stop dancing, get chance and luck! \\n\\n\r\nThat plot is Angel Beats' single largest flaw. The premise is promising enough, and about nine or ten episodes in it does just fine. Hilarious interactions give way to exciting fights, over-the-top Japanese sports events and so on. But the show's climax comes a little out of left field, and ends up being precisely one episode too early, leaving a good 25 minutes filled awkwardly. Even the show's early scenes suffer from this in retrospect. So many good questions about destiny, life after death and eternal love are either subverted or go plain unanswered. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Angel Beats both lives and dies on the unique little details it contains. A perfect example is the theme of RPG elements like NPCs, invincible enemies and even a hit counter. Things like this are quite delicious, but leave you wishing for a bit more. But fans of almost any kind will find something to enjoy here, be it comedy, action, romance, drama or good old animation. Angel Beats provides quite a tangible experience for those looking for one; I know I'll be humming these songs for days to come.",

            "content": "Angel Beats! Possibly the world's most polar anime. It's either you're:\r\nType 1: This anime is amazing. Deep storyline, moving, too touching. I SEE THE WORLD IN A NEW LIGHT NOW\r\nType 2: I cried more when my fish died, and I didn't even know I had a fish\r\nBut anyways, as usual, I'm going to start off this review by saying a very misconception thing in MyAnimeList. I see great reviews, but 0 of 100 people found this helpful, because this review probably gave the anime a low score. So what do people who support the anime do? \"It's time to declare war\" and spam the NotHelpful button. I'm always like, it's called \"Click if you found this review helpful or not helpful\" not \"Click if you like their rating or don't like their rating\"\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, Angle Beats! manages to create a pretty confusing and as well enthralling opening. In fact, I didn't even realize what was completely going on in the first 6 episodes, which is why many people don't like it since they stop watching it because it doesn't give a quick explanation, but once you realize exactly what is going on, you start to like it more. The story is pretty original and the execution I think is one of the best. It starts off by asking some very thought-provoking question such as \"Why do I live\" \"What reason do I live for\" \"What do I need to do while I am alive\". The anime itself starts off with a boy who finds himself in the world after death (the afterlife) and join a group known as the \"Rebels Against the God\". Unfortunately, he forgot how he died so he basically tries to uncover why. I'm not going to continue and describe because that would spoil it for you.  For story I would give it a 9, because I will admit that there was a lot of potential and the execution became a bit rushed at the end. \\n\\n\r\nArt doesn't need to be explained. The animation is all fluid and eye-pleasing. A solid 10 here. \\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats! Soundtrack is probably one of my favorite soundtracks. I found that it really set the atmosphere for the scenes in the anime and the opening and ending theme are pretty catchy. There are some pretty sad songs that really fit with the sad scenes in the anime and some very action-packed soundtracks which fit with the uprising of conflict. I give Sound a solid 10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are quite original in this. The main character (Yuzuru) has a pretty interesting back story. In fact, all the character have their own unique and different back stories and although the anime doesn't focus on other as much as they probably should, they only made this 13 episodes, so for 13 episodes, I think they did a pretty good jobs with the characters. I give it a 8.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, there some parts in Angel Beats! which make no sense whatsoever. And there are many parts which you have to put a lot of thought into in order to understand it and enjoy. If you push through the first 5 episodes, the anime can be very enjoyable and if you get the main part of the what story is trying to put out there. I would give enjoyment a 7, which is still a good rating.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Angel Beats! is a ground-breaking title with a somewhat expected ending, creative story, excellent execution and tragic end to it, or rather leaving the viewers to decide what happens, and more importantly, what will they do after watching this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for the feedback, cool beans bro.\\n",

            "content": "I write this knowing full well that haters will hate and lovers will love. There are anime that have a habit of having a completely split fanbase. Unless you are Mars of Destruction, there is bound to be people who truly appreciate the anime. However, I've never run across an anime with such radical sides as Angel Beats!, and probably never will. So for the reader, a word of caution. If you don't love it, you'll hate it. If you don't hate it, you'll love it. This is an anime where its isn't just \"liked'. Based on my scores you can probably tell which sideof the fence I stand on, so rather than taking my review and running with it, use it as a guide to form your own opinion, whether it be with it or against it.\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats is another Key powerhouse anime, but differs in that it is not adapted from a visual novel and is only 13 episodes. Angel Beats involves the concept of a \"limbo\" in the form of a high school where young adults go when they live an unfulfilled life or lose there memories and get lost. One such person from the second category is Otonashi. Upon arriving and not knowing who he is, he is pulled into a rebel group that breaks the rules of the school. The reason for this is because if they follow the rules, the will pass on, and the group believes if the rebel they can stay \"alive\". However, the student council president, nicknamed Angel, fights the group to the death regularly (since they are already dead they can't die). The story also contains very tragic back stories for the characters as well as side stories, but ultimately fails to have a main central plot. This is the main reason it is bashed. However, as many series don't have plots and succeed, Angel Beats makes up for it in full with the other four categories.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Angel Beats is consistently gorgeous, which is hard to find in itself. While other series save the good graphics until it counts, Angel Beats has it throughout, and when a moment comes where it \"counts\", the art is beyond gorgeous. such as the band sequences or the xmas tree scene (remember this!). \\n\\n\r\nI honestly don't know where to start with the soundtrack other than saying its the best I have heard in anime, by a clear mile. With beautiful flowing melodies such as \"My Most Precious Treasure\", exciting tracks like \"Theme of SSS\", kickass Girldemo inserts like \"Crow Song\", and a beautiful OP and ED, the soundtrack is nothing short of perfection.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Angel beats can be overwhelming. The characters are in all shapes and sizes, not one alike even in personality. This is truly unique in that its hard for characters to have original personality when there are so many characters. The only problem that I may have is that there were a few that lacked a back story, but with the important characters explained, it leaves the mind to wonder for itself, which can be a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats is not only a fast-paced yet hysterical action comedy, but it is quite possibly one of the most emotional dramas you will find. Without spoiling anything, Angel Beats has easily one of the most tear-jerking and emotional endings in anime, as if to reward the viewer. And like I said in the beginning, this is a guide. It is up to you to find out if you like it. Personally, this is my all-time favorite anime, and will be for a long time.",

            "content": "A raw diamond, that's what Angel Beats is.  It solid and beautiful but it is not perfect.  The series does have it's flaws but they are easily overlooked by the magic it creates.\r\nThe setting of Angel Beats appears to be at a high school like a large number of other anime, but that's only part of it. Everyone in that world is dead and each one has some sort of regret from when they left their past life.  The plot itself is solid, it's well written as a whole, it fits the setting and it presents a good mix of school lifeand the supernatural. However it is not all flaw free, the story seemed all over the place at times and although the pacing is not bad, it's not the best either.  The series tries to do too much in the little time it is given which makes some of the plot feel rushed. Nevertheless, the plot is still  able to create moments of sheer brilliance and overall it is a pretty impressive plot.\\n\\n\r\nIt's pretty easy to tell that a lot of work went into the art and animation. The animations are very crisp and dynamic and all the backgrounds are well drawn, but where the best stuff lies in the concert scenes. The lighting effects are perfect and animation are actually more detailed during these scenes. Needless to say that Angel Beats is really appealing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is amazing too. The Opening and Ending were quite nice and it really fits the anime. The voice actor also did a solid job, they all matched their character and also brought some life to them. The songs during the concert scenes were great too.\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats has a large cast of characters and half of them really don't need to be there. A lot of them aren't really memorable, they don't undergo any significant development nor do we learn much about them. Despite all this, for a 13 episode series, Angel Beats does a fairly decent job with the characters. At first the characters seem very two dimensional but the main characters do undergo development and we also learn some of the character's back story making them more interesting. \\n\\n\r\nThis series is highly enjoyable. The magic that the series makes greatly overpowers the problems that the series has.  From the mysterious beginning to the heartbreaking ending, Angel Beats will have you coming back wanting for more.\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats is a series that had the potential to become a masterpiece but a couple of minor problems prevented that from happening. However it's problems still can't take away from the beauty of the series.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Angel Beats follows the story of one Otonashi, an amnesiac that suddenly pops up in what can only be called Purgatory. He quickly meets two of the residents of this strange world: Yuri and Angel, whom are locked in a never-ending battle of sorts. Yuri leads a group of humans like Otonashi in \"rebelling\" against the system, while Angel seems to be an agent of the system keeping them in line.\r\nAngel Beats is another short anime coming in at only 13 episodes. As a result, the pacing is pretty good most of the time. The plot is presented in a fine manner. I do wishwe had more character-centric episodes though.\\n\r\nThat said, what we do get out of the series is good. There's quite a bit of character exploration going on with the main characters of the story (Otonashi, Yuri, Angel). Some of the supporting characters aren't bad either, Yui and Hideki are pretty well explored too.\\n\\n\r\nWithout spoilers, I can safely say that they have some very complex reasons for existing in this purgatory. Everyone has some reason that they refuse to move on.\\n\\n\r\nAs a side effect of such a world, most of the members of Yuri's group are eccentric. These aren't the usual archetypes that you'll find mashed together in anime. Yuri openly opens that most of them are idiots and that she is only slightly better than the rest of them. It's an oddly funny (and welcome) way to lampshade these misfits.Especially at the beginning, Angel Beats dips a bit too far into senseless comedy shenanigans. To be honest, it feels like we should have been doing something more important than having a music episode or a journey underground through traps (I will admit it was funny though).\\n\\n\r\nAs such, the series gets a bit of thematic dissonance going between the early episodes and late episodes. They are just a bit too thematically different for me to give it a pass. Even if the early episodes were meant to help us get acquainted with the characters, it felt like there wasn't much of it going on anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThis all is probably a result of the short episode count though. The show is a bit too ambitious with such a large cast of characters. There's a lot of ground to cover in the series and only a fraction of the characters get any major development. I think the show could have very well benefited from more time to develop the cast more. This is probably the biggest problem that Angel Beats overtly has.\\n\\n\r\nThis is best for someone looking for a good, short series that will invoke some powerful feelings. It is pretty much guaranteed to invoke one tear somewhere in its run. It has some nice characters and some wacky humor.\\n\\n\r\nAll things considered, it was good.\\n",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nA lot of people waltz around giving Angel Beats a 10/10 rating acting like it is some sort of masterpiece. Angel Beats is enjoyable and it accomplishes its overall goal for the most part, but it is also very flawed and it most certainly is NOT worthy of a 10/10 rating, or even a 9/10 rating.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe premise for Angel Beats is actually pretty compelling. Several high school students who have lived unfulfilled lives die and awake in a purgatory-like setting where high school never ends. The students who have appeared here are fighting off an \"angel\" who is trying to \"obliterate\" them,meaning force them disappear form the world and move on to the next life. Coming from the same people behind simplistic plots and environments like Clannad, Kanon, and Air, that is very complex plot. \\n\r\nThe story actually has a fair amount of twists and emotional moments, but it has a major problem in the sense that it feels rushed. This is an example of an anime that needed to be 24-26 episodes long to effectively accomplish it's goals; not a measly 13.The shortness of the anime really hurts Angel Beats in the departments of pacing and character development (more on characters later). The story was enjoyable, but it never felt cohesive or coherent. The writers seemingly picked random episodes to dedicate to the plot, random episodes to dedicate to comedy, and random episodes to dedicate to individual characters. The story of Angel Beats is a classic example of having so much you want to get done and having so many things you want to put in your anime that you bite off more then you can chew.\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong though, I still thought the story-line was compelling and interesting throughout. When the show finally decided to slow down and focus on character development, it started to look more like the \"masterpiece\" everyone says it is. There are a few legitimately emotional moments later on in the anime when the backstories of some of the characters are explained. The problem that these moments don't happen until the very end of the anime and they all happen way too quickly in succession. If the pacing was better and the anime was longer, Angel Beats could have easily gotten 10/10 in this category.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nAll you have to do is watch the opening sequence to Angel Beats to know that the animation is fantastic. The characters and backdrops look fantastic at all times. Certainly one of the better quality animations you will ever see. I considered giving it a 10/10, but I'm very stingy when it comes to art ratings I guess.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nAs I mentioned previously, all you have to do is watch the OP. The music is fantastic and it is the perfect compliment to the anime. The voice acting is also above average in my opinion. No complaints in this department. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nThe characters in Angel Beats are the opposite of what they should be; the main characters are under-developed and lacking in personality while the supporting characters are WAY more entertaining and WAY more interesting. \\n\r\nThe protagonist, Otonashi, is an average character I suppose. The only thing unique about him is his tragic backstory, but since EVERY character in Angel Beats has a tragic backstory, even that doesn't really make him stand out. He is only involved in comedic moments when it is initiated by other characters and he fails to demonstrate any real dynamic traits with the exception of a romance he has with another character, but even that feels rushed and poorly executed. There is no reason to like or dislike Otonashi, and that is his biggest problem.\\n\r\nYuri is a character that has been done a million times before. She's the leader of the group, extremely stern, and doesn't take shit from anyone, but (shockingly!) she is a good person on the inside. Yet again, she is okay, but nothing special.\\n\r\nAngel is actually a decent antagonist. She is intriguing in the beginning because she is shrouded in mystery and her motives are unclear, but once everything about her is revealed, she's a bit boring. She has her moments, but Angel has a very underdeveloped personality, which is a missed opportunity.\\n\r\nThen, of course, there are the supporting characters, and boy are there a LOT of them. Angel Beats has WAY too many characters for a 13 episode anime. The obvious result of that is that 90% of them are underdeveloped and never have their backstories revealed. However, they still are successful characters because nearly all of them are funny and they all have a distinct personality. TK, Yui, Irie, and Fujimaki all made me laugh multiple times during the anime and all have distinguishable personalities. The supporting characters of Angel Beats are constant sources of comedic gold, but because Angel Beats is so short, none of them have a chance to be properly developed, which is a damn shame. I was more interested in the supporting character's backstories then I was in Otonashi's! But we never get them, and that is the reason this category only gets 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nIn case I haven't exaggerated this enough; Angel Beats had absolutely no chance of accomplishing what it set out to do in only 13 episodes. This anime needed to draw on it's great supporting characters by developing them and it needed fix all of it's serious pacing issues to get anything higher then a 7/10. Angel Beats is probably still worth a watch, but it feels like a bit of a missed opportunity. If it had a bigger budget, it could have been the 10/10 anime that everyone wants it to be.",

            "content": "Welcome to the most overrated anime in existence! \r\nAngel Beats is a show that amazes me in regards to its insane popularity which I feel is completely unwarranted. This show is a culmination of everything I dislike in lazy story telling and writing. While the premise for the show does sound cool being that it's set in the afterlife with characters getting to live out their lives as if they were still alive, the main issues is the inconsistent tone and ideas. This anime has no idea what the hell it wants to be and constantly jumps between different tones and ideas while not fleshingout any of these ideas in the slightest. They start off wanting to fight God, then they want to play in a band and then we get a large amount of tragic backstories all without any downtime between any of these events to allow the audience a moment to breath or to allow for any kind of character development in the slightest.  The anime doesn't know if it wants to be a comedy, a drama or an emotionally heavy melodrama. There is no consistency between each of these events making the anime feel jarring to watch. Now, it's not like it's uncommon for these genres and ideas to go together in anime but here, the anime doesn't allow for any development due to the rushed pacing and bad writing. \\n\\n\r\nThis problem is mainly due to the terrible rushed plot that the show has. Jun Maeda is the biggest hack writer who is working in anime right now and instead of learning the mistakes he made here, he just went on to repeat them all in Charlotte in 2015. The show moves at such an insane pace that there is no room whatsoever for any character to develop nor to explain the world and mechanics of said world at all. Speaking of the world, why on Earth did it have to be set in a high school of all things? You have such an interesting concept in which you could do anything with and yet they set it in a high school? Of course this makes the anime more marketable to its target audience and one my argue that it's set in this way since all the cast are indeed teenagers. But that's where another one of my gripes stems from. All of the cast are teenagers just to allow the otakus to self-insert themselves into this narrative easier making most of the characters no more than bland wish fulfilment. This wouldn't have been a necessarily bad thing if the characters themselves were interesting at all. Which none of them are.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all so bland and are so forgettable, so-much-so that I want to grind my head into a wall on account of how dull all of them are. None of them receive all too much in the way of character development and a lot of that is because of the relatively large size of the cast. There simply wasn't enough time to flesh out everybody especially since most of the time, the show was more concerned with telling jokes than actually telling a story. Each character is less defined by a personality and characteristic and more so on a stupid gimmick or design making them feel no more than lifeless puppets. The main character especially lacks anything to make him endearing in the slightest. He is as dull as dishwater. He has hardly any emotional attachment to the plot and he is hard to sympathise with since he has as much personality and charisma as a plant. His backstory too was hardly developed and felt like a cheap way to make his character seem deeper at the very last moment. And that's where another problem arises. People feel sad for the character's backstories rather than the actual character themselves. There is no investment in the characters themselves; why they act the way in which they do and their own motivations as people. Developing a character should be more than just throwing in a random backstory to win the sympathy of an audience. The character still needs to grow throughout the duration of the series, be interesting or have some kind of engagement with the audience. None of the characters have this at all.\\n\\n\r\nOne Piece is an example of a show in which does the whole tragic backstory pretty well. Each character in One Piece has a sad backstory in order to win over the sympathy of the audience but each of the characters have clearly defined goals, personalities, growth and each one of their ideologies is explored enough to make them feel like real people and more so like characters. This does not happen in Angel Beats. The character's problems in the show are essentially solved by lengthy exposition scenes and just by having one character talk to another. Boring as hell as well as lazy.\\n\\n\r\nEach character is essentially an archetype of another existing visual novel or anime adaptation with each one lacking in originality as well as in character design too. The designs, for the most part, were so generic that I can't remember hardly any of them despite the ones with terribly implemented gimmicks. The characters as a whole are extremely weak and while there is some comedy thrown around its not enough to salvage the horrible script and lack of anything happening. To be fair, some character interactions and even some of the jokes can be pretty funny but this clashes in tonal shifts with the rest of the show and, again, is given no time for development. \\n\\n\r\nYurippe is the only character in this entire show that I felt had some attention giving to her and she does develop decently as she begins to understand the world around her. However, she could of been replaced by anyone else in this show and wouldn't have made a difference at all. She is still pretty bland development-wise but amongst the rest of the cast she is like a God. Otonashi was simply a plot device, a simple and easy way to push the story forward whenever it was convenient. His amnesia, something I already dislike was something to be used so that the battle with the angel-chick was not over in a matter of minutes.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was very well done with no shortage of great animation and the soundtrack is one of the greatest I have ever seen for any anime. The opening song was very well done too and the music does a good job at engaging the audience in what is happening, even if I didn't care what was happening at all. Angel Beats is a show that tries to appeal to everyone and of course, this worked making it one of the most popular shows of all time. The narrative is boring and jumps awkwardly between tones and even whole genres, the characters are VERY weak and everything about this show makes me want to drink bleach so that I never have to witness this show ever again. P.A Works is a studio that I never really liked anyway, with the exception of one show and this is by far their worst anime, and that's saying a lot.\\n",

            "content": "Presenting a Phantomhive review of [Angel Beats] for your reading pleasure.\r\nStory(5): In all my years, I have never heard of such a ridiculous idea of an afterlife where you are allowed the opportunity to resolve your regrets from an untimely death. Death will come for you sooner or later whether you have regrets or not. If you are going to die sooner or later, why not move forward in life with your own two feet all the time? That way you will have lived a life worth living, thus this idea of requiring some disturbing afterlife world in order to resolve regrets will become completelyunnecessary. As such, I believe this story to be quite silly even to Children. And Children are quite demanding when it comes to Anime afterall.\\n\\n\r\nArt(7): This anime certainly is a delight to watch for its clarity of art. The colors and visual animations are at a very high level indeed. I foresee a day in which such animations would be considered one of the best art forms of the 21st Century, just as fake paintings of the Mona Lisa was in the 19th Century.\\n\\n\r\nSound(8): Such heavenly sound quality most certainly deserves high praise, the music is capable of completing the emotional element that is being portrayed visually. Often times, one is so drawn in to the moments of great emotion that the music exits your conscious mind and into your subconsciousness, wherein you may be moved to tears without your knowledge.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(8): Quite possibly the greatest strength and the saving grace of this anime is its Characters. Even with a ridiculous plot, these characters in Angel Beats have managed to perform splendidly. Indeed, they may be dead but they still were capable of moving forward or rather moving on to the next life. Once something is lost, it can never be regained; however, humans have the ability to hope, dream, and continue on even in the face of tremendous obstacles. Indeed, that is what sets us Humans apart from Demons. Therefore, even in death, the Characters remained Humans to the very end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(7): Angel Beats is quite enjoyable, worthy of spending an afternoon watching while procrastinating on other tasks. Allow the characters to bring you into their world and you will experience the emotional thrill that is Angel Beats.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(6): It is a great shame that such strong characters with high quality visual and audio works of art is spent on such a plot. Should you be one who enjoys witnessing the afterlife of characters who had their life shorten by unfortunate circumstances, you may come to love Angel Beats, unlike I.  However, if you find such plots regarding the inner mind of characters to be boring, then I suggest you seek other Anime to enjoy. This concludes the Phantomhive Review of Angel Beats.\\n\\n\r\n[This review has been brought to you by the Funtom Company!

            "content": "Angel Beats! is what happens when you build a bridge rated at 2 tons and then try to drive a 4 ton truck over it. You might be okay for the first half of the bridge but somewhere around the middle the structure begins to give way and eventually the whole thing falls apart. Many other reviewers before me have said that this series deserved to be twice the length it was, and I solidly agree. However, we were given a 13-episode series, and as such I will review it without speculating what various aspects of the show could have been improved with a longerruntime.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Setting: 3\\n\\n\r\nOur MC Otonashi wakes up dead in a world seemingly only consisting of a large high school, and is promptly thrown into the fray in a conflict between the SSS guerilla faction of students who refuse to be assimilated into the afterlife and mysterious girl named Tenshi. By itself, the premise is tantalizing if not entirely original, and shows promise for the first few episodes as our main gang undergoes numerous \"operations\" to combat Tenshi and introduce Otonashi to his new home. However, the story takes a turn for the non-sequitur right around episode 5. New enemies arise then give way rather quickly to a resurgence of old conflicts, then the world quite literally starts to fall apart. The problem I had when experiencing this story was that little to none of it after the first initial episodes made sense. \"Why are the characters doing any of this?\" was the question that frequently ran through my mind throughout the show. One central tenet I maintain with any anime that attempts to tell any degree of a serious story is that it is fully responsible for enabling my suspension of disbelief, regardless of setting or characters. I consider myself to have a high tolerance level for fantastical situations, so I mainly look for a believable and understandable story progression. Angel Beats! failed at delivering on this. Things just seemed to happen for the sake of moving forward, character motivations were handwaved away and a romance subplot appeared basically out of nowhere that left me more confused than happy. Ultimately, I appreciate that the story has a good introduction and a definitive conclusion, but I could not turn my brain off and accept the sequence of events that connected the two. \\n\\n\r\nOne particular issue with storytelling I want to highlight is Angel Beats' reliance upon exposition to tell large chunks of the story. I realize that this is likely a product of the series' short length but the majority of it could have been left out or highly abridged and I would have felt smarter as a viewer for understanding the characters or plot progression better. ESPECIALLY because anime as a medium is about showing and not telling, I am very disappointed with how the writers chose to convey parts of the story like this. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\\n\r\nEven with detailed backstories given to a portion of the main cast, I simply did not care for any of the characters. None of them had, in my opinion, any real surface depth beyond superficial character traits like \"the glasses guy\", \"the genki girl\", \"the Rei Ayanami expy\", \"the male Winry Rockbell who speaks English\", and so on. Character backstories only seem to reinforce outward traits rather than add complexity. Even for characters like Otonashi and Yurippe, I didn't sense any significant change or progression over the course of the show. When characters changed their opinions of each other by the end of the show, it felt forced rather than as a logical outcome of their motivations and beliefs. Lastly, and this is mainly a complaint from the perspective of being a Western viewer, I was frustrated that everyone was a stereotypical Japanese anime high school student. There were no original or innovative character archetypes to freshen the usual formula. Good characters can sometime salvage a shaky plot, but unfortunately this was not the case here.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nI would be lying if I said I was unimpressed with the animation and artwork. My only quibble is with the individual character designs - Angel Beats! was adapted from a Key visual novel and I am not a huge fan of their art style. However, P.A. Works knocked it out of the park with everything else. Backgrounds and lighting are beautiful, HUDs looked crisp and character movement was fluid and intuitive. Angel Beats! goes the extra mile in many spots, like fully animating GirlsDeMo with the guitarists' hands forming actual chords. It is not the most impressively animated show I have ever seen, but it certainly surpasses the norm for the type of show it is and deserves my appreciation. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis show's saving grace. Angel Beats! has seriously one of the best soundtracks of all the anime I have seen. The opening grabbed me from the first piano chords and ushered in an OST full of amazing songs. GirlsDeMo was a particular highlight, providing great rock songs that influenced the overall atmosphere of the show. Background tracks that played during action scenes or even moments of dialogue were great to listen to, one of which in particular reminded me of the music from Zelda: Twilight Princess. The OST overall gave a certain vibe of both enthusiasm and vigor with hints of eerie otherworldliness to perfectly complement the show's setting. I'll be listening to it for a while. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I can't say I regretted watching Angel Beats!. However, I don't feel any happier for having watched it either, except for having good new music to listen to. The show was a jumbled mess of poorly composited story progression and shallow characters that didn't earn my emotional investment.",

Overall the story is still good because the characters make the story more acceptable but is the weakest part of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound\\n\r\nThe animation is great despite being from 2010, the characters design looked very good but they could've done a better job, the background for the dramatic scenes in combination with the music was great. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was great, the VA cast were very good and the music was perfect for the scenes and the OP is just beautiful. When you end this anime you'll want to cry somehow just by remembering that OP (i almost cried just remembering it right now) and the ED was good, the song for episode 10 and 13 Ichiban no Takaramono destroys your heart and even more in the last mins. of episode 13, that combination will make you cry to no end. Overall both art & sound were great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe development on almost everyone was very good, i can't go deep on this without spoiling, so i just have to say they were great but a couple of them didn't make sense on their stories and you will find out the two of which i'm referring about and i still have that question but even with that nonsense those two are two of the best characters; I wanted to know about the others and even more about TK which was a mistery, but why are they in purgatory? you don't get  a couple of characters back stories and it was a let down how they ended but the characters were very good in general.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nDespite the big plot holes, the things that didn't make sense, the questions unanswered, despite the negative things, the enjoyment was great, you will enjoy the action, the music, the characters, you will cry in the sad dramatic moments, cry because of the songs, because of the really tear jerking episodes, it's just a trip of feels, the last episode destroys you, it was too much to handle because of the great VA performance but with a big plot hole in that part (already stated) and the last 3 sec. of that episode didn't make sense considering the previous heartbreaking scene (that already had a plot hole) but all in all it was a very good ride.",

            "content": "I had a great time with Angel Beats. In fact, the ending had more of an impact than After story's. I'm not saying this just to incite a flamewar. The sole reason is that angel beats imo found a more creative, more \"anime\" way to instill an important message. Perhaps I will discuss this more in my After Story review. \r\nCONS:\r\n- one word: inconsistent. some significant plot holes, jumps, and out of nowhere resolutions that's made throughout. Personally this didn't bother me as much because I EXPECT a higher degree of randomness in anime, but I can understand someone who would be taken out ofthe experience due to them. \\n\r\n- Angel Beats is not really a romance story. They tried to shoehorn romance in it and, in retrospect, I actually wished they didn't because I thought the anime stood on a higher, more important pedestal. \\n\r\n- Many people will mention the lack of character development. True, but I think some people equate lack of development = automatically bad. Not necessarily. I think the studio was aware that some characters are not as important as others, so to me it's perfectly understandable. If the story as a whole makes the emotional sense in big ideas, especially in a comedy/drama series like this, you don't need a 100% development of every individual on screen especially when the cast is so large. \\n\r\n- didn't really care for the \"singing sessions\" within the episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n- First series in which I thought both the OP and EP were great. especially EP.\\n\r\n- For a drama series, the humor was ON POINT mostly. some were misses because they tried too hard in explaining why it is funny but still solid (Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki Kun did much worse in this area)\\n\r\n- As prev. mentioned, this series knows how to embrace anime to its fullest potential to bring unique entertainment \\n\r\n- ending wasn't a cop out but still satisfying in that it is much more gentle/careful than expected. I'm not gonna pretend that I saw that coming honestly. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I want to analyze more is the ending episode.\\n\r\nThroughout I was debating between a 7 and 8, but it's a 9 because the ending sealed the deal. After the jokes, actions, and background stories, It reminded us what Angel Beats is really about. In its essence, it represents the will and regret of someone who has died too early, a concern I think everyone can relate to. As a health career-pursuing individual, I have nightmares about how empty would it feel if I die of a car accident or a disease after investing so much of my life into this future. It is a question worth thinking about because god/world/w.e. can be cruel. As an introverted person, forcing myself to spend time studying biochem in the library alone when I already have a hard time making friends is...frustrating. Browsing through the social highlights of your peers on facebook while admitting that you haven't received a red notification in weeks can be discouraging. Honest work sometimes doesn't pay off. But it's still important to will and live on. \\n\\n\r\n\"The wind rises, but we must continue to live.\" (s.o to Hayao Miyazaki)\\n\\n\r\nThe positive message in Angel Beats that i find inspiring is that it doesn't glorify loneliness. It tells us that you shouldn't endure alone. Notice that, while setting is the \"after life\", it is nevertheless a reflection of the present--to tell us to find or become the \"Otonashi\" of our time. You realize that what these \"unfulfilled\" individuals really wanted was not so much to accomplish w/e activity itself, but to be given an opportunity to share their experiences and  connect and empathize with people in similar situations to ultimately find salvation of the soul. We don't have to be dead to understand this. In our present right now, we are obligated to help but are also deserving of it. That is a triumphant message imo and a rare feat in anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I thought Angel Beats was going to be  this rushed ride to that climatic ep13 when I'd cry and move on, but the series was heavier, more savory than that. The individual episodes (most of them) stand for itself . it doesn't have a high re-watch value for me but I'm glad I did. Objectively, even though it says 9, it's more an 8.5. But here's the thing:It's only been hours since I finished it so what's on my mind tbh isn't analysis. I'm just happy that this exists at all.",

            "content": "One of the only anime that really hit me hard emotionally. So I feel obligated to write a review on how much I enjoyed it.\r\nStory: When I first heard about this anime, I believed it to be a cliched story where the protagonist falls in love with girl, then girl turns out to be evil. Well to be honest, I'm an idiot for thinking that. The story line of Angel Beats is outstanding, the emotional attachment you get from watching the characters fight against God for giving them their horrible lives. It's probably the best anime to make you feel compassion to the characters.\r\nArt: Tobe completely honest, I have seen anime with better art than Angel Beats, but those anime are very few in number.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening music and the closing music are probably one of the few anime openers that I could sit through with pleasure.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is the section that really got me into this show. The attachment I had to Masami Iwaswa was greater than any I had ever felt to a character in an anime. How her dream of singing was crushed when she became mute, and why she cursed God because of it. And this is just one character out of the 20 or so that has this kind of experience.  All the characters in this anime are there because they curse God for giving them a horrible life.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 Just amazing. You come away from this anime feeling like crying because of how emotionally attach you become to the main character. When you see the struggles he grows through you can't help but cheer him on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A must watch anime. I cannot fathom how people can say this anime isn't worth the 57th spot. Just a masterpiece.",

            "content": "Personally, I have such a small attention span that I can't really watch series longer than 50 episodes at a time. I like to keep to series around the 26 or 13 episode length. But personal quirks aside, longer series can really benefit the story you are trying to present by having more time to fleshing out you're story and characters. This is what I believe \"Angel Beats!\" lacked, keeping it from being  a great anime.\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nStory:\r\nThere really isn't enough substance in the main story-line of Angel Beats! to really grab me the way I wanted it to. A lot of it is just randompandering to spit in the face of a certain character. The amount of sidelining to do random missions, and focus on other characters and their backstories leaves the main storyline as just an empty shell, nothing more. That being said, when the show decides to focus on those side stories involving the backstories of the main, as well as a few side characters, it quickly turns from being simply enjoyable to being almost tearjerking. The amount of quality put into these episodes is so great that it almost puts the rest of the show to shame. If the show focused more on the characters rather than its mishmash of a story, it could've been so much better. \\n\\n\r\nEven though the story was mainly a mess, the amazing execution of the comedy scenes managed to really make the series extremely enjoyable for me. The comedy in Angel Beats! has to be some of the best comedy I've seen not only in anime, but in all media as a whole. Coupled with those side stories, it becomes the adhesive that makes this series so much better, and ultimately worth the watch. But in some ways, even the comedy was a problem. It wasn't so much how funny some of it was, it was more so the timing of which these comedy scenes occured. You could have an absolutely beautiful moment, and then right after, someone comes along and kicks someone in the face. Talk about ruining the moment.\\n\\n\r\nAnd one last note. The romance. There was not a single trace of it until the very end of the entire series. If you want to put romance in a series, make sure that you build up to the beautiful blooming romance, not just randomly put it in without any warning whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nFirst, let's talk about Otonashi, the supposed main character of the series. Although everything is seen through his eyes as he is put into this high school purgatory,  he does little to really influence the direction of the already inconsistent plot. He mainly just stands around and does nothing, spectating what the other characters are trying to accomplish. But honestly, I can't really fault him because that's exactly who he is supposed to be, a completely bland character. It is learned that he has amnesia from the transition of living to dead (this isn't a spoiler cause we learn this in episode 1), having no previous knowledge of the life he lived. This means not just us, but Otonashi himself doesn't even know who he is, and is basically just a blank slate. But this is what really pisses me off about his character. We learn about his backstory sometime throughout the series, and in his backstory, he is a leader who wants to help as many people as he can because of the things he has faced in the past. However, after his backstory, his present self seemed to have no change whatsoever. You would think after that he would have have some character development.\\n\\n\r\nNext, we have Yuri, the leader of the Battlefront Otonashi is more or less pushed into joining. She is a very eccentric woman who wants to fight God because she thinks that the life she got was completely unfair. She was a much better off character than Otonashi was, being given a decent character motivation, as well as a great personality. The direction she was inevitably led to was less than desirable, though.\\n\\n\r\nRounding off the main character trio, we have Angel, the person everybody seems to hate for one reason or another (don't need to spoil anything). She falls into the Rei Ayanami archetype, saying around 100 words throughout the whole series. For a lot of the time, she just seems more of a plot point than an actual character. She does get more interesting later on in the series, but still only a slightly above average character in my eyes. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, we have the supporting cast of characters. These guys pick up any of the slack the main cast may have left behind. Each and every one of them have interesting personalities, and are responsible for the great comedy this series has to offer. A few of them are also the focus of the aforementioned side stories, which were better than I could've imagined. I just wish they could've focused more on these characters, maybe giving more of them a greater background and such. \\n\r\nThe supporting cast is so large that it would take all day to name them all, but I will mention the four I found to be memorable. The first three, Iwasawa, Yui, and Kaname, being the ones who are in the breathtaking side stories. Iwasawa, a girl who wants nothing more than to save someone using the music she plays, much like how the music of a band saved her life. Yui, an overly energetic girl, who was at first extremely annoying, but had a very well justified backstory which made it so that her being annoying was actually a plus.  And Kaname, the love interest of Yui, and someone who has a love for baseball. Honestly, I think Kaname would have been a better choice for a main character than Otonashi was. \\n\r\nAnd finally, the fourth side character worth mentioning, and my favourite character by far, is none other than T.K, someone who just cannot stop moving and dancing. He has the most random things to say, and says them in such an unorthodox way, you just can't help and fall in love with his character. I have not seen a character with a personality so completely original like T.K's since Okabe Rintaro from Stein's;Gate. It makes me cry that they gave him so little screen time, because his character was just so damn interesting.\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nP.A Works is one of my favourite studios to date, and they do not dissapoint with Angel Beats! From the lighting to the artwork to the actual fluid animation, everything is solid throughout the board. Something I really thought was a nice and welcome touch was the changes they kept making to the opening and ending. In the opening and ending, they would show off every main and supporting character in the Battlefront, and whenever a new character was introduced, or a character leaves the Battlefront for whatever reason, they would either add or remove that person from the opening and ending in the next episode. I found that this addition had a refreshing effect when changing to a new episode. \\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nFirst, let's start with the opening and ending again. There isn't much to say other than they are simply beautiful, and a treat for the ears. They also made a small but extremely nice touch to the vocals of the opening in one episode. In the beginning scene of an episode, Yui is auditioning for the school's band, Girls Dead Monster. When she starts singing, the opening starts rolling, but in a with a different vocalist than the norm. The way they made the opening flow with the scene of the show was truly fascinating.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack itself was good, but nothing spectacular. Everything fit the tone of whatever was happening, but with the exception of a couple tracks, nothing really stood out as something I would listen to outside of the show. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, the dub. I think the dub is worth listening to rather than the sub. This isn't because the voices are any better, because in all honesty, the voice acting is mediocre at best. The script, however, is one of the main reasons those comedy scenes really jumped out as being extraordinary. I can't imagine myself laughing as hard as I did watching it in subbed format. So my recommendation is watch the dub, even if the voices make you cringe at times (I'm looking at you, Greg Ayres), because I believe it won't be as enjoyable if you watch it subbed.\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nThe thing about Angel Beats is that it had so much potential, but the lack of episodes really decays the overall quality of the show. There are so many absolutely breathtaking moments in this show, which are the reasons why I would easily recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of the comedy/drama genre. However, there are so many other problems that I feel could be fixed if everything wasn't so rushed due to time constrictions. The main story couldve had more meaning to it, Otonashi wouldn't have to be so uninteresting, the side characters could be more fleshed out, and the ending would have been so much more satisfying. That being said, even though Angel Beats! is riddled with many problems, there is ultimately something to really enjoy here, and I do recommend it to give it a watch. I definetely found it worth my time (for the most part), and I think so will most of you.\\n",

            "content": "Before I write this review I must say, \"Angel Beats!\" is a fairy tale. Sounds weird? It's true. It's not an intellectually run anime, it's kind of a shonen (but not really), the action is great but that's not the point. This anime bases itself off of what most animes tend to touch on, philosophy. It's talking about Buddhism, with a hint of Christianity mixed in, addressing what happens to people who die after living horrible lives out of their own control. Watch this anime through this lens and it will not only make more sense, you may actually come to like it (no matteryour view on religion.)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nI can't give it a 10 because it's clear there are a few parts of the story, clarifications and such that were rushed or ignored which leaves the viewer a bit confused. The anime also in my opinion spends a bit too much time in the sandbox so the story doesn't really start getting good until about halfway through. Despite that, however, the anime does a great job selling itself. It's clear the staff was having a lot of fun writing the plot for this anime. The first half, episodic plot, was a lot of fun to watch and despite them messing around most of the time they did manage to squeeze in a few very significant events that the second half of the anime built on.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 12/10\\n\r\nThey must have sacrificed having a full season for a massive art budget. Stunning visuals, honestly the concerts had me mesmerizes. Not only that but they pulled off the unthinkable, the female characters, while having huge eyes, have actual physical dissimilarities on their faces! By slight changes in eye shape and facial structure, I can actually tell them apart beyond hair style/color!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nClear crisp voices in both the dubbed and subbed versions. If watching the dubbed version be sure to get subtitles to the songs (they're in Japanese) because they are (one is) deeply rooted in the anime. The opening and ending themes are great, I really enjoyed listening to and watching them. The soundtrack is pretty generic, but no complaints.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nWell developed characters, really nice. Some are given more screen time and consequently more development, but it's pretty obvious who the main characters are and they have well developed stories. My only problem is there is a bit of mystery involving Tachibana which could have bee cleared up quite easily, but it remained leaving the viewer feeling like the anime was a bit unfinished.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nDefinitely an enjoyable anime. Being only half a season its pretty easy to watch and not much to think about. Go in expecting to change your life and you'll be disappointed, but go in just willing to have fun and open minded, and you'll love it.\\n\\n\r\nmake sure to tune in for after the ending theme, they often (not always) have a short extension to the episode.",

So going into this I was very excited to see where all the praise came from. And sadly, I couldn\u2019t find it. \r\nAngel Beats is about Otanashi, a regular 17 year old who is mysteriously transported to a place he hasn\u2019t been to, meeting people he hasn\u2019t meet. He learns that he has arrived in the afterlife, but without any of his memories. \r\nThis concept gave memixed feelings at first. Many of the comedic scenes used the fact that they couldn\u2019t die, which was really fun. It felt like it made fun of many anime that had came out at that point in time. But I was also scared that I wouldn\u2019t care about the characters fates, since none of them could die. \\n\\n\r\nBut as I continued watching the show, these statements would falsely represent my feelings. The introduction of obnoxiously loud characters and badly timed jokes made the comedy a lot worse. I have never really been a fan of comedy in anime. There are exceptions to that \u201crule\u201d, but for the most part, the comedy doesn\u2019t work for me. And I think it\u2019s this show that made me realize why that is. Obnoxious characters annoy the shit out of me. Examples would be Yui and Yuri from this show, Misa from Death Note and Kaori from Your Lie in April. A lot of it\u2019s comedy is just a character crying really loudly or screaming. \\n\r\nThe show is a subject of \u201cdramas with unfitting comedy\u201d, with anime like Your Lie in April and March Comes in like a Lion (S1). There are many serious moments where they put in a joke that just feel jarring.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect that was very praised was the music. And while I really liked the soundtrack by itself, the usage of them really annoyed. It felt like they used the same two songs over and over again. That wouldn\u2019t have been a problem if it was kept unnoticed. But every time they played either \u201cDecisive Battle\u201d, \u201cToy of Spring\u201d or \u201cCritical Point\u201d (Could be other songs too) I remember that this song was played 100 times before. It took me out of the show is what I\u2019m saying. Still, really unique and pretty good overall.\\n\\n\r\nBut what surprised me the most was how much I didn\u2019t care. If you go to any \u201cwhat anime made you cry\u201d, I assure you that Angel Beats will show up at some point. Every single one. But unfortunately, that never happened to me. I never really attached myself to any of the characters, or at least enough to cry for them. There were moments where I felt sad. I guess the end made me a little sad. But it was rarely more than knowing that it was supposed to be emotional. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEh, as you can tell I was a little disappointed in the show. It is fine of course if you love it, I can understand why it is so loved. But personally, it never got to me. \\n\r\nA 6.2 from me, so still positive.",

However, summer came and I got really bored and started watching it again since it had high ratings on some sites. And, I must say, I am very glad I resumed watching Angel Beats, because it is an excellent anime. Not on the level of Clannad yet, but I think it may get there. \r\nEpisodes 8 and 9 especially are the ones that remind me of Key the most.  The characters are verygood too. I really like Otonashi and Yuri and their pasts. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I know this isn't much of a review, but I just wanted to say that you really need to give this series a chance. It may not be good at first to some, but please stick it out. I promise, you won't regret it. :)",

            "content": "This is my first review so yeah..\r\nAngel Beats! - Though it is still too early to give a vivid review since I have only seen the first episode, I can only say that it has raised my expectations for the next few episodes to come. The story begins quite suddenly though this does help the viewers to get a feel of the story. \r\nAngel Beats! mixes plenty of comedy to this potentially very serious plot that is in my opinion the best kind of combination. \r\nStory - The story as I said begins in a quick and fast pace that could leave viewers behind ifyou are the slow reader (referring to people who watch subbed versions like me). The main plot of the story is simple yet has much potential to develop into something much deeper. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt - The character designs are beautifully crafted and animated though not really revolutionary. The graphics of the anime is very catchy for the eyes especially with gunshots and Angel's abilities. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound - As with many first episodes, this one did not have the OP in order to set this story. The voice acting was very suitable to the characters and their varied personalities.The different environmental sounds during the shoot outs and other fighting scenes contributed well to the heart pounding and exiting situation with the song playing in the background. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The characters in Angel Beats! are in no way a unique and special  addition to the anime universe but they are extremely fitting to the storyline. The main male lead is a very cliched but suitable character in the story as he begins his 'inner journey' of morales and beliefs. You have Yuri the extremely hyper and eccentric girl that leads the group and makes awesome plans and then theres Tenshi (angel), the quiet seemingly harmless girl that wont even hurt a fly but is actually potentially a devastating and ruthless character. It is strange that we don't know the main lead's given names so far but I suppose its to maybe make it a surprise for us.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I for one definitely enjoyed watching this and I would recommend   this for all those Key fans or any people who want a kick after watching this. For those who love their toys-that-go-boom unlike most other Key productions, Angel Beats! has plenty of guns and explosions. For those who need good drama in the series then this is for you too. 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nSince I have only seen the first episode and my opinion and review is based solely on it I rate Angel Beats! 8.75 out of 10 but since its so close I'll just give it a 9 to round up, I can't wait for the next episode!",

            "content": "Ah, Angel Beats! caused some serious flame wars, built massive fandom and hatedom and gained much attention. People like to discuss it, so good job, P.A. Works, huh?\r\nThe story was written by Maeda Jun-shi, a famous person in anime community, who was a creator of such popular novels as Kanon, Air and Clannad. Kanon was just awesome and deeply influenced me, Air had a really sad ending\u2026 oh god, it was sad, it even made a cynical personal like me to cry over it, and Clannad\u2019s strong point was a healthy dose of good ol\u2019 social philosophy. Well, looks like I can be qualified asa fan of Maeda-shi\u2019s works, but what really made me into watching Angel Beats! is that music from trailer. It is a way beautiful and it even gave me a feeling that Beats is going to be one of the most amazing anime I\u2019ll ever see.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, when the first episode came out at last, I had too much work to do, so I couldn\u2019t watch it for a couple of days. After I finally got a break, I was very tired and sleepy, but in spite of this I got my hands on Beats. \u2018Dammit\u2019, I thought, \u2018I waited months for this and nothing can hold me much longer.\u2019 Then twenty minutes had passed. I was sitting in my chair and staring blankly at the screen. I felt like\u2026 Y\u2019know, imagine the scene: you walk down the street and suddenly you hear some man playing his violin. Playing really, really good, and his music touches your heart, fills it with joy and stuff\u2026 And the next thing you see is the violinist hitting by a truck and his blood and organs spitting all over the place. And that\u2019s exactly how I felt watching the first episode of Beats.\\n\\n\r\nIt looked like the creators got a JPRG overdose and then watched *that certain anime*. (I think you understand what show I\u2019m talking about, but saying it out loud usually leads to a flame war. I saw some really horrible examples of this and, lemme tell you, that was scary.) Beats looked like a ripoff of it, but with guns and even more madness. I was just freaked out. Did Maeda-shi really write this thing?\\n\\n\r\nNow, when the show\u2019s over, I can judge more objectively. Beats has two major problems. The first is unbalance of comedy and drama here, and the second is that this show has more characters than episodes. Y\u2019see, you can\u2019t just overwhelm the viewer with loads of characters, you need to show him their traits, good and bad points and so on. The viewer must develop some feelings for character, either love, hatred or something else, so when character dies, the viewer will rejoice or cry over his death. That\u2019s the most basic thing in drama. Here we have a lot of characters added only for appearances\u2019 sake. I didn\u2019t even bother to try to memorize who they are; they just stayed till the end with nicknames like exhibitionist guy, shotaro boy, halberd goon, etc. And Christ, yeah. The creators apparently thought that it\u2019s a wonderful running gag, but the result is I don\u2019t remember that hacker\u2019s real name and call him Christ. Alas.\\n\\n\r\nUsually I complain about 26-episode shows being lengthy and filleresque, so I prefer shorter format. The thing is, Beats is the first 13-episode anime I wish to have standard season length. If the creators got more screen time, they could have done something with that army of undeveloplings. I think this is an indispensable condition for turning this anime into something more enjoyable. Either this or sacrificing some of secondary characters, so the author could focus on developing the main cast. At least T.K. was cool. I wanted to see some of his backstory or something, but that\u2019s Beats we\u2019re speaking about, so\u2026 Hope his seiy\u016b, Michael Rivas-shi, will get good roles in the future.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand this anime had a lot of potential. Its art is perfect, and so is the music. Someone somewhere said Beats is great in one certain field, in which K-ON! sucks hard, and that field is being music. I totally agree with that statement. Well, in the end Beats showed some touching scenes even with that mad plot it tried to offer, but sadly it was too late: I already gave up on trying to like it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd one more thing I want to say here. The feature, which I like the most in Maeda-shi\u2019s works, is that certain emotional mood they often create. It is a unique element of Maeda-shi\u2019s style: creating a romantic story, adding a pinch of fantastic elements there and finishing it with a bittersweet ending, so your feelings can roar like a hurricane. It\u2019s like a modern fairytale \u2014 unrealistic, but it makes you wanting to believe in it. Kanon has this feeling, and both Air and Clannad do, but Beats lacks it. The latter feels like some JRPG trying to be all cool and deep, and that\u2019s the biggest reason I don\u2019t like this show. Maybe Maeda-shi got a writing block or something, but he could cope with his task much better.\\n\\n\r\nI thought about giving Beats 6 points for the sole reason of T.K. and nice art, but the show finale contained really sad scenes, so I kinda enjoyed it a little. Therefore it\u2019s 7 out of 10. Dull.",

            "content": "It's usually a pretty tough and sad experience when a viewer can do nothing but watch as a character that they love or completely adore, or even simply a character in general, well... dies. But what happens when those characters already start off dead? Isn't that already the end for them? What kind of story could you possibly create with characters whose lives have already ended? The answer? Angel Beats.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nWaking up in a strange place, a sort of purgatory in the form of a typical high school, the protagonist Yuzuru Otanashi finds himself with a fair case of amnesia, namely his memories next tolost; he finds himself dead.\\n\\n\r\nThe Afterlife Battlefront; a group of young people in which each of them have a severe inability to move on, being completely consumed by their deep feelings of regret and blindly refusing to accept their pathetic excuse of a life they only, shortly, got to live. Their lives; filled with nothing but struggle, nothing of any true significance, not even a chance to turn that sort of life around; ended, just like that... and they couldn't do anything about it. \\n\\n\r\nA story about regret and being unable to accept an unjust life, Angel Beats tells the story of people who hold such feelings, and how they cope and manage, being stuck in this world where their days are filled with rebelling against God and his helper, a small girl by the name of 'Angel'. In which case, the protagonist, Otonashi, attempts to retrieve his memories and remember just who he is as a whole; to remember what his life was like, and why he finds himself stuck in such a place.\\n\\n\r\nThe potential this show had was strongly evident; 13 episodes to convey a message as strong as it should be, was quite poorly executed. A typical 24 episodes would've sufficed. Speaking of which, it was certainly possible that is was due to the short amount of episodes, that this anime leaves the audience with various unanswered questions, making it feel quite incomplete, although it is fairly paced. Nonetheless, the story in and of itself was quite beautiful and if given enough appreciation, it may even be more than fairly enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Angel Beats is visually stunning! The colours are sweet and vibrant, creating an atmosphere that could be considered happy, despite each charcters true backstories and emotions. Some scenes, mostly the concert scenes, are displayed more beautifully than others, but regardless, the entirety of the art is quite brilliant!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMost may have already heard of this, but it definitely deserves some further repitition; the sound- that being openings, endings and OSTs, are absolutely gorgeous! This is definitely one of its greatest aspects! The opening is beautifully put together and the song is beyond exquisite. The OSTs sound remarkable and is simply an absolute joy for anybodys ears. The ending is also such a sweet and simple way to end each episode. It's quite safe to admit that the sound is next to remarkable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the best and most beautiful aspect of each character is their backstory, the truth that is their lives. For most of them, their memories are something they want to forget, or at the very least, have no bother in ever retrieving, in knowing the pain it may cause them. Unfortunately, most, or perhaps all, have retrieved their memories. They know the kind of life they lived, and that sort of acts like a catalyst, giving them the determination and motivation to rebel against God and 'Angel' causing their current emotions of utter refusal. \\n\\n\r\nEach charcters' backstory is, to put simply, what shapes them, and what determines who they are now, in the present. It is what drives them to such strange and almosy crazy extents, the stunts they perform in a way of rebelling against God are often just that, strange. But, despite not every character getting a proper backstory and only a very, very few actually getting one, the past is presented to be  something of, definitely haunting. No matter how much they fight or refuse to accept the patethic lives they got to live, it is definite that the past is not something you can easily run away from, it's not something one can simply overlook or ignore. It runs in the back of their minds, everyday. And as these characters backstories unravel, we as the audience, realise that life is more than what we make it out to be, and that what we spend our days of living on, hide a somewhat mysterious truth. And sure enough, these characters slowly, slowly and slowly, find their own form of closure, and soon enough, discover that they can accept their lives, and finally, pass on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nA short, yet beautiful story, Angel Beats is fairly enjoyable with flaws that can almost easily be overlooked. Almost. Honestly, not the best, and it could've been portrayed better, but with a fair amount of appreciation, it is definitely quite remarkable. If you wish to watch this show, then I won't stop you, in fact, I'd probably encourage you. A sweet and fairly lovable story, Angel Beats is a definite reccomendation for nearly anyone, so feel free to watch, I will not stop you. Not at all.",

            "content": "Prepare yourselves for the most biased, ranting, fanboy review you will ever receive so humbly into your anus:\r\nANGEL BEATS- doesn't have to be perfect- to be perfect.\r\nThe themes it covers are astronomically profound: loss, the meaning of life, the nature of death, regret, acceptance, camaraderie, love, existence, etc. This show is incredibly dynamic, stirring up multitudes of emotions. Starting out, Angel Beats has a lighthearted and funny overtone. Because of this, the dark and tragic moments or the sad and endearing moments have quite an impact. \r\nAngel Beats partially conveys this in a personable way through the MAIN characters' past. These characters have some seriousdevelopment, translated through their realizations and the entirely new role they play as a result thereof. Angel Beats also made the interactions between these main characters very engaging. \\n\\n\r\nNo, unfortunately not all the characters got this kind of attention and depth that played so beautifully into the plot. They may have all been unique, but some of them definitely lacked a real purpose. This is a direct result of the length of Angel Beats. Ok, so the anime is too short, needed to be a little longer. i agree. but it doesn't mean the character development is bad. actually, that means that it's SO GOOD that you wanted more and couldn't stop bitching about it. Again, the MAIN characters hold up the fort in this area. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the supposed plot holes... IT'S THE FUCKING AFTERLIFE. does everything have to equate to perfect logic?? do YOU know the true nature of death? or what comes after? if you need to have everything explicitly explained and laid out for you, you're not smart enough to appreciate the art. This is an anime that provokes thought. and if you don't get it in the end, or it doesn't make sense, that's your problem not the anime's. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in this anime is unparalleled in both style and execution. It really adds to the emotion and theme of every scene. Also, Girls Dead Monster is my fucking jam and all you haters can go get obliterated. TKkissyou OUT!!!",

I can like it, but in overall, it wasn't THAT amazing.\r\nFor once, I can say I really do like the characters. They are all unique and many of them add a higher level of hilarity to the anime. TK for example is fucking hilarious in some parts just because of the randomness of it. I could go on about how each character has their funny moments, but beside that- the characters are shallow themselves. They fall in love in a mere few seconds or episodes for unknown reasons besides 'she's alone, maybeI am desperately in love with her' and 'you're alone, I'll marry you.' That's kind of retarded and 'dense' as far as the characters go. The character designs: great, adorable. Personality: somewhat unique, haphazardous. In-depth emotion: Non-existent, forced.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the story goes? It's interesting but wasn't zoomed in enough. For an anime with something this interesting and with interesting characters, they could have at least gone about it in a more extensive way. They pushed all the characters into scenarios, and they reacted at the turn of a dime. No hesitation. The 'deep inner parts' of the story? NONE WHATSOEVER. Don't become that one English teacher who finds the 'deep meanings' in the book, because there isn't one. This was just an anime about people falling in shallow love in a painful after life.\\n\\n\r\nThe good parts of this anime? They force you to cry at the end. Good feels. And that's about it, as far as Angel Beats! goes. Humour and forced emotion.",

It's the perfect anime to piss off your peers if they ever want to get into anime or a well-written fiction in general. I have to say that this is the worst anime I've ever watched, yes even worse than Tite Kubo's trolling in Bleach. I was ready to drop the series after episode 4 but forced myself to finish the series to give a fair review of it. Even after watching the ending, which determines the true quality if the series is really good or bad.An ending can either make or break the series. Well in this case, the anime was already terrible to begin with but the ending made it even worse, filling your head with more loose ends, questions and headache.\\n\\n\r\n The characters are bland, story is nonexistent, lacks good humor and most of all, I dislike the childish art despite what others think. Now let's move onto the aspects that saves this terrible anime. However, the only saving grace is the interesting music and the concept of a purgatory where goals were to be fulfilled during the time when he/she/it was alive. In spite of the good aspects of this anime has, it is so miniscule that it's completely irrelevant and doesn't change the series from being absolutely, utterly crap.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I was truly surprised to see that this anime is so highly rated among viewers.  I get the feeling that this review will generally be ignored for that reason, so I ask that if you're an avid fanboy/girl of Angel Beats!, please just scroll down to my overall section of the review where I acknowledge that I didn't hate the series, so as not to rage over objectivity.  \r\nI'm not sure if my dislike towards this series has to do with my lack of \"experience\" with anime, or if it might in fact be because of the lack of \"experience\" on the viewers'part.  Before I say anything about the series itself, let me just say that the main problem I had with it throughout was that almost every aspect of it was simply a cookie-cutter copy of a different anime, but without the charm and execution.  This is also my first review, so forgive me if it lacks any thoroughness.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI thought that the story, or at least the setting, was among the anime's strongest points, before you get down to the specifics.  I've always enjoyed anime that involves throwing children/young adults into their own situation where they are the ones who act as the adults, making their own decisions.  I liked the idea of the \"alternate universe\" that this story takes place in.  I liked the idea that the students at the school have formed their own faction and hierarchy of command.  I also really liked the idea that there was an aura of peril and urgency to the story. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I really disliked, however, was the overly-dramatic character backstories which drive the whole anime.  I can appreciate a really sad story, not only as the setting for the anime itself, but for characters, but this takes it way overboard.  Each character has their own horrific backstory, but they're horribly written.  It feels like the writers just compiled everything negative they could possibly think of, and then they just carelessly dumped it all into the characters' pasts.  Hardly any of the characters' stories were believable, and with almost every story-advancing episode, I found myself yawning, saying, \"Here we go again, more tragedy, more sadness\".   \\n\\n\r\nThe amount presence that tragedy and sadness have in this story is so enormous that it's borderline humorous, and it made a lot of the story very predictable, which really spoiled what I think would have otherwise been a few decent twists.  It isn't without it's few sweet spots, though.  Some bits of the story were genuinely sad or happy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the big things that turned me off of the anime to begin with was the odd animation.  Don't get me wrong, I can definitely appreciate that it's a pretty-looking anime with the gradients in the hair and the eyes.  The overall art style was pretty pleasing to the eye.  What bothered me was that the actual animation itself was very choppy and weird.  No matter how pretty the art style may have been, I can't shake the feelings of \"cheap\" and \"low-budget\" when I watch an anime in low FPS with choppy animations.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI thought that the sound was among the strongest points of the anime.  I don't know what to say, other than that I enjoyed the music and the sound effects were nice.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nQuick note, here: Kanade (Tenshii) is generally an acception to this section of my review.  I quite liked her. To be totally frank, I pretty much hated the characters -- None of them really had any depth unless you count their \"tragic pasts\", and beyond that, they were all pretty typical, cookie-cutter copies of other personalities in other anime to begin with.  The anime tries to make some of the characters feel mysterious and distant, but I feel that it failed every time.  Above all else, the humor that constantly demanded attention throughout the story was absolutely cringe-worthy most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nNone of the characters, Kanade included, were really original.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nI'd like to note that despite my many problems with the show, there were a few nice spots that I really enjoyed that made it (somewhat) worth it to stick through it until the end.  I particularly liked the ending and the way it tied off a few loose ends, though it was a little corny.  I also really enjoyed the few scenes that involved the main character's past, and (so as not to ruin the story) the events that led up to him being put into this alternate world. \\n\\n\r\nI think that this anime would have excelled if it were aimed at a younger audience, but I can't bring myself to believe that that was the intent, given all the instances of suggestive themes thrown in here and there.    Most of the characters were really annoying and lacked depth, aside from the backstories which were unbelievably loaded with tragedy, which in turn made the whole thing pretty predictable.  I found the humor to be generally juvenile (with the exception of a few cases), which really left the characters without any real redeeming qualities.  Overall, I appreciate that the writers wanted the characters and story to incorporate a lot of the things that we love from other anime, but I felt that it just couldn't deliver in an original way.",

            "content": "\"I see dead people\" - that kid from The Sixth Sense\r\nI do too, kid, and they're pretty awesome, if I do say so myself.\r\nAngel Beats has gotten a lot of love and I'm here to add to that love, as it was the first anime I ever watched (besides Pokemon) and was what got me into this addictive media. That being said, it's not without it's flaws.\r\nThe story (8) is set in purgatory - that place between heaven and hell - with a whole bunch of teens that had awful pasts. There they have the Afterlife Battlefront, full of said teens, that is against God.Otonashi, our main guy, joins said group to fight against God and a mysterious girl named Angel.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a pretty good concept, with comedy and action scenes that are mixed together well. The only major downside is that it takes place in a school - of course - and only has teenagers except the NPC teachers. This makes it unrealistic and what makes it even more so is that some of the characters have powers, which don't really match the tone but whatever, it made for good action and funny scenes. Another annoying bit is the ending, which is sweet but leaves something to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art (9) is beautiful. It's crisp and the action scenes are easy to follow. The character designs are a bit clique but the overall art is great. The band scenes are also very well done.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the band, the sound (9) is another high point to this anime. Girls Dead Monster was great both times around and the overall OST was beautiful. The opening and ending are also very well done. I couldn't skip them at all.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the characters are both the best and worst thing about this anime. There are just too many to be expanded upon in just 13 episodes. I know this was originally supposed to be longer and I really wish it had stayed that way. The characters that do get expanded upon have tragic pasts that make you want to cry and they all seem to be important. The supporting characters provide good support, but I wish they all had backstories like the others.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is very generic, as is Angel, but that didn't stop me from loving this. Characters - 8.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment is a 10. I cried the first time I watched this. Granted, now that I watch it again, I have the whole nostalgic factor, which makes me love it even more. If you cry easily or just like sad backstories, this is for you.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: Not even Angels can compare.",

            "content": "\"To the well organized mind, death is but the next adventure.\"\r\n- J.K. Rowling\r\nI joined MyAnimeList yesterday, and today I write my first review about one of my favorite animes. In truth, it is only the first because of alphabetical order, but as I sink into my memories of the story and soundtrack, I think its appropriate I begin with this one.\r\n.:.: Story -- 9 :.:.\r\nAngel Beats is about the struggle. Not fights and certainly not the ideals behind them. The setting makes it very clear that it's too late for such things. It's about what to do along their struggle for happiness when not evendeath can spare them of it. Everyone gathered in this setting have had a terrible life. Their cries for help gone unheard. And their worst nightmares came true.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise is that people with horrible lives are brought together through supernatural means for unknown reasons and must struggle against a terrifying supernatural existance: the \"Tenshi\". Which literally translates to \"Angel\" in english. In the afterlife, where death means only taking a short nap, they continually struggle what seems to be a hopeless fight with constant physical pain of enduring Tenshi's powers and their own psychological problems from their past, miserable lives.\\n\\n\r\nWhat particularly strikes me is how the perspective given from the start (our dear protagonist, Otonashi Yuzuru) is that a emotionless supernatural being is out to enslave them, or worse. Out of desperation and being attacked by her after exchanging very few words, Yuzuru agrees to join the SSS (\"Shinda Sekai Sensen\" or Afterlife Battlefront, if you prefer). But thorughout his adventures he comes to realize that despite how easily they can manipulate things in the afterlife, the reality of life itself remains the same: they must cope with their struggles, both past and present.\\n\\n\r\nI think the message of the story was that communication between people is truly priceless. Words alone can indeed save people.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n.:.: Art -- 9 :.:.\\n\\n\r\nThe art here is first-class fit for a first-class story. Whether it be the wild chases along the beautiful looking afterlife setting, the eye-catching lighting effects with indoors and otherwise, and the character designs themselves. All of them can be summarized with words like \"cool\" or \"beautiful\" if not both.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n.:.: Sound -- 10 :.:.\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats' soundtrack is second to none in the universe of anime. There are noteworthy and/or memorable individual opening themes, tracks and ending themes in many animes out there, but very rarely is the package deal as great this. I dare say that there are only soundtracks AS GOOD as Angel Beats. You can clearly notice the detail and love put into each of them; it's as good as it gets. Hell, Girls DeMo? The musical group within the cast of characters? They're an ACTUAL BAND that had their debut in this show. Those are the reasons I hold Angel Beats' OST in the highest regard. The members are the voice actors for each respective character. How much more awesome can it get? To me, it can't.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n.:.: Characters -- 9 :.:.\\n\\n\r\nSince about 50% of any story progresses in regards to the protagonists and antagonists, it's only fair I leave no stone unturned here. Or it would be, but this just so happens to be one of the cases where the back stories of the characters are the ultimate spoilers. And unfortunately so, because while Angel Beats deserves its reviewers to look over all details. What I can tell you is this: the \"emotional truth\" captured by this show is very impressive.\\n\\n\r\nBut their painful pasts aside, there is much to enjoy at face value. They really are that good. Yuzuru suffers from amnesia and goes by means the others in the SSS consider \"too radical\" to recover them, so far as to attempt communicating with \"Tenshi\".\\n\\n\r\nYuri, the leader of SSS, is the unwavering dedicated leader who suspiciously spends a lot of time alone sorting out her thoughts and burdens. It grows even more interesting given how she was given a position of leadership at a young age, and the cost was the curse of the afterlife she shares with the rest of the cast.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n.:.: Enjoyment -- 10 :.:.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think I need to say anything to justify this. It's purely subjective, I know, but I don't think any more needs to be said after I've spent so much time evangelizing everything else for you, my dear reader. I wrote all of this because I really think everyone who reads this should watch the show.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n.:.: Overall -- 9.4 :.:.\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats earns a rank of 94% awesome in my book, and I hope you enjoy it just as much as I did.",

            "content": "I found the angel beat series to be very mysterious and compelling on a new level of anime involved with high school, science fiction, and supernatural. The animation and story as well as the elements makes it worth more than watching and stands out from its peers for being a simplistic but complex drama and it's emotional tone also has an effect on viewers too. Even though I found the anime enjoyable and funny at the same time it doesn't answer many of my questions about the characters' origins and where are they and what are they trying to do. Also I found the wholelife is worth living as a bit cliche and didn't feel sad or even cry when the characters disappear without a reason or the unfair end they had in their young life's. To tell the truth, I think life for some people can be torture and death is an graceful escape that can free them from their pain and life is also very cruel at sometimes and death acts like almost as a benevolent force that gives you peace when you are at your end, even your life was horrible death can give take you away from that pain and give you a new start in a new place with a better life. Angel beats was a good anime but I found many parts (including the ending) to be rather corny and unconvincing for you to cry at their misery and because the whole setting and themes is almost black and white to real life and the the show really needs to answer many questions for the characters and their reasons for being here. In other words it was an more than average anime for me but still looks cheesy, confusing, over dramatic, and utterly non moving for someone like me and the main characters have a little too much screen time as well. If there was a second season it should be a prequel or sequel that has different characters with more interesting personalities and a more understanding plot as well as a villain because villains always makes the show more interesting. This anime was good but it isn't for me and is for the more sad and expressional type of anime fan, thanks for reading my review of this strange and over deluxe anime.",

The majority of the show is just wacky, over-the-top humour which in and of itself is fine, but it makes it incredibly hard for you to take the characters seriously. This, coupled with the fact that you ARE supposed to take the characters seriously (at least with the Haruhi lookalike; this is displayed in the somewhat random and almost out-of-nowhere moments where there are serious flashbacks and attempted tearjerker moments,) just makes this show atrainwreck and not a very interesting watch to boot. The characters for the most part lack distinct personality; most of them are just common archetypes, are defined by a single quirk or just plain uninteresting. The only real character of interest is TK, and this is due to the fact that he is just so peculiar in his vibrating, jittery non-stop movement and that all of his dialogue is entirely in English (and, to the show's credit, incredibly well done! I applaud his VA, he has incredible diction!) \\n\\n\r\nIn summary, the show just feels like it lacks proper direction. The characters are for the most part, dull and the art is mediocre at best; there is really nothing to capture the eye or the mind in this show, short as it may be. I believe that there is a lot of room for improvement and given another shot, it has incredible potential; the execution seen thus far was just incredibly lazy and poor. I'd love to see another iteration of the show where more focus on character development and story is made to coincide with the humour instead of just letting the funny bits be what most of the show rides upon.",

            "content": "About every two weeks, I have in-depth anime discussions over the phone with my best friend Sean. We first became friends through our obsessive passion for Dragon Ball Z; over the years, our anime preferences veered in different directions. While I lean towards the critically acclaimed classics and hidden gems, Sean sticks to extremely lengthy shonen series (and, I suspect, ecchi titles as well). While there are some things we agree on when it comes to anime, there are many things in which we don\u2019t. In one of the few Sean statements that I support, he said one day that he usually doesn\u2019t like currentanime with amazing graphics, explaining titles like this are for a viewer \u201cwith the brain of a goldfish\u201d. Sean also said that he doesn\u2019t normally approve of the aforementioned anime category because their amazing animation is used to distract people from a multitude of jarring flaws.\\n\\n\r\n\tWhen thinking of Sean\u2019s statement, the first thing that comes to mind (for me) is Angel Beats. While I often hail certain anime as \u201cunderrated\u201d, I make a point to avoid calling a title \u201coverrated\u201d. In a medium filled with holier-than-thou elitists, pathetic weaboos, \u201cI-like-what-everyone-else-likes\u201d bandwagoners, overzealous bloggers, and critics who despise anime altogether, it\u2019s impossible for anything to be rated properly anymore (if it ever was). However, as your average anime fan, I say that Angel Beats is overrated. Scratch that; I say that Angel Beats is wildly overrated. Two OVAs (\u201cHell\u2019s Kitchen\u201d and \u201cStairway to Heaven\u201d), one manga, one visual novel game, and a four-episode internet radio show are all byproducts of the beautifully-designed abomination known as Angel Beats (Even YouTube has jumped on this cash cow, charging people money to watch this garbage). What tempted me to check this out in the first place was its title (Thought it was about a hip-hop-oriented heaven) and its vaguely interesting premise: a young man wakes up in the afterlife, joining a randomly assembled group of teenagers to fight an evil entity named Angel and discover why they\u2019re there in the first place. This synopsis sounds pretty good, right? This anime, however, is anything but.\\n\\n\r\n\tHow do you know when a series is going downhill? Most of the time, you can tell when a particularly painful joke/line is repeated to death, when a beloved character crucial to the plot is killed off, of when panty shots are bombarded at you in a desperate attempt to attract viewers. Sometimes, it\u2019s only obvious near the end, when you can tell the most jarring of plot holes will never be resolved. With Angel Beats, however, I could tell from the first episode \u2013 no, the very first scene \u2013 that I was witnessing a natural disaster. A little after Otonashi, our protagonist, wakes up in the afterlife, one of the main characters (a girl named Yuri) gives him vague information of where he is and how he arrived there before she asks \u201cI know this is sudden but could you join up with us?\u201d The question comes across as an out-of-the-blue line designed to quickly shuffle the story along. In the first episode, the purpose of Yuri\u2019s group (and the series in general) is presented (the purpose being to fight Angel) but the motive behind their purpose is never fully established (the closest conclusion I could piece together is that the characters blame God for what happened to them in a previous life and, since Angel is apparently the next-best-thing to \u201cThe Man Upstairs\u201d, they attack Angel in an attempt to take down God). The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, like Angel Beats, is a school/slice-of-life series with drama and supernatural elements, and it\u2019s obvious that Angel Beats seeks to aspire to Haruhi Suzumiya. The imitation can be seen in the baseball game and its importance to the plot during episode 4, which is stolen (or inspired, depending on your opinion of Angel Beats) from Haruhi Suzumiya. It can also be seen in the show\u2019s three central characters; Angel is a more emotional version of Yuki Nagato while Yuri is a watered-down revision of Haruhi and Otonashi is the poor man\u2019s Kyon, deprived of the sharp wit and consistent nonchalance that made Kyon an enjoyable character. What separates Angel Beats from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, however, is the show\u2019s attempts to be light-hearted through practical pranks but unfortunately the pranks so dramatically over-the-top that realism is ruined and the innocent fun is sucked out of it. For example, in episode 1, Yuri\u2019s gang exerts too much manpower and force into an extremely trivial act (stealing people\u2019s lunch money) with the vague purpose of it somehow affecting Angel. If you\u2019re staring at this review with a raised eyebrow, trust me; I\u2019m just as confused as you are.\\n\\n\r\n\tBesides Otonashi, Yuri, and Angel are an army of supporting characters, some who are a little more than vaguely interesting but none of them are really important in the grand scheme of things. Takayama is the token smart guy, an insufferable hacker/nerd with a catchphrase that he repeats to death (\u201cCall me Christ\u201d). Naoi is a green-haired hypnotist with a God complex and a borderline-homosexual obsession with Otonashi (In episode 12, he blurts out his feelings for our protagonist by screaming \u201cI wanna be with you!\u201d). Ooyama is a blank slate, an average student with no personality or distinct traits whatsoever. My least favorite character of the bunch has to be Yui, an annoying, hyperactive wannabe-singer with pink hair and a miniscule amount of depth. The only tolerable character is the blue-haired Hinata, who\u2019s easily my favorite in the series, the second-in-command of Yuri\u2019s gang who is also near-homosexually obsessed with Otonashi but is a thoroughly developed character overall. Excluding Hinata, the writing in Angel Beats doesn\u2019t help out the characters too much (a disappointment for a people-driven title like this) the cast often speaking in vague terms and repeating lines. The acting in Angel Beats isn\u2019t simply bad; it\u2019s as if the voice actors are on a collective cruise control setting, not bothering to inject any real emotion or passion into the script. None of these actors, however, are more atrocious at their trade than Blake Shepard (the voice of Otonashi), whose lack of vigor in his role is beyond belief (There are only two scenes where Shepard shines as a somewhat legitimate actor: in episode 6, where Otonashi punches Naoi in the rain, and in episode 9, where he has a pivotal conversation with Angel at the hospital). In order to counteract Otonashi\u2019s untalented voice actor, the show gives him a random, out-of-the-blue backstory that\u2019s admittedly a bit touching but it\u2019s a horribly rushed method to give a character depth. Besides the protagonist, Angel Beats also administers this treatment to several members of the supporting cast, proving that this show has no clue of how to fluidly develop a character.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe \u201cBeats\u201d in Angel Beats has \u2013 I have come to realize \u2013 less to do with hip-hop (still a major disappointment) and more to do with an emphasis on music, easily the one highlight of the series. This emphasis can be seen in the episode titles, which are mostly named after songs (like \u201cFavorite Flavor\u201d, \u201cChange the World\u201d, and \u201cKnockin\u2019 on Heaven\u2019s Door\u2019\u2019). As for the soundtrack itself, it\u2019s pretty decent but not particularly special; the fact that I consider Angel Beat\u2019s good-but-not-great soundtrack the best thing about this series is pretty depressing. There\u2019s a lot of hype around Angel Beat\u2019s opening and, while I admit the visually appealing theme song grew on me, I wouldn\u2019t call it one of the greatest. Among the many things I don\u2019t like about this show is its lack of style, its unwillingness to use its amazing animation in creative ways. One of the few instances of animation creativity is in episode 10, where the characters are paper cutouts pasted on an artistically detailed sketch as Otonashi describes his plan. The other exhibit of creativity is in episode 3 (literally the only great episode in the series), where band leader Iwasawa transforms into a white silhouette with vivid colors exploding inside of here as she listens to the band Sad Machine. The aforementioned episode 3 contained subtlety, mystery, depth, motivation, and emotion, none of which can be used to describe Angel Beat\u2019s plot.\\n\\n\r\n\tOne of the biggest rules for the characters in Angel Beat\u2019s afterlife setting is not interact and/or follow the routines of NPCs (a term used for the show\u2019s background characters), which includes attending classes and eating lunch with them. Over time, the show slowly but steadily forgets this instruction, allowing the characters to go to class several times (At one point, Yuri (the one who ordered this rule in the first place) talks with an NPC and even considers it a \u201cfriend\u201d). This is one of many, many plot holes in this flawed failure, one of many instances where this supposedly great anime loses its consistency in the story. Not only are there plot holes in Angel Beats, the show also has moments aplenty that are intended to be funny or dramatic but are ruined once again due to the awkwardly stilted story. In episode 4, Hinata beating up Yui is deployed as an exhaustive \u201ccomedic\u201d tool (A potentially great scene from Hinata is ruined near the end of the episode when the show switches up their running gag with Yui attacking Hinata. SO ORIGINAL!!). In episode 5, it\u2019s an uninspiring running gag of a flying classroom seat that spoils the experience. Episode 8 is where Angel Beats attempts to be dramatic, where members of Yuri\u2019s gang kill themselves to stop an onslaught of Angel doppelgangers; this scene doesn\u2019t work because, after a while, screaming the names of dying characters becomes repetitive. It doesn\u2019t work because the characters are already dead so the impact of their sacrifices is obsolete. For Angel Beats, it arrives at a new low in episode 12 (the second-to-last of the series), where random shadow monsters materialize literally out-of-the-blue and the climax of the episode makes this experience worse. A conversation between Yuri and the mastermind of the shadow monsters introduces the programmer of the afterlife with a backstory involving a lover, this programmer being the \u201cGod\u201d whom the series revolves around. This conversation is the show\u2019s umpteenth attempt at being deep and complex (for once, it kinda works); what pisses me off about this is that here the show finally has a potentially intriguing plot element and it never capitalizes on this (It\u2019s barely even mentioned again). The philosophical conversation and how it\u2019s handled would\u2019ve been the nadir of Angel Beat\u2019s tenure\u2026 if it weren\u2019t for the finale.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s, not, how you start; it\u2019s how you finish,\u201d \u2013 The Hours, \u201cAli in the Jungle\u201d\\n\\n\r\n\tDuring the beginning of episode 13, Otonashi informs Yuri that almost all of the supporting cast had disappeared form the afterlife, to which Yuri replies, \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d (After making her dramatic \u201cThis is my life\u201d speech in episode 12 about how much she cares for her crew, Yuri\u2019s reply comes across as yet another example of lazy, terrible, inconsistent writing). It gets worse; the characters who are left (Otonashi, Angel, Yuri, Hinata, and Naoi) create a makeshift graduation ceremony (After all, this is a school anime) and I have to endure listening to them sing a dull, uninspiring song TWICE. There has been a lot of controversy over Angel Beat\u2019s ending and I have to say it\u2019s easily THE lowlight in a series with an ample supply of them; the contrived, out-of-the-blue, overdramatic conclusion epitomizes what I\u2019ve spent six paragraphs trying to tell you. Angel Beats is an anime that attempts to be so many things but fails over and over and over. It tries to be the next Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya yet to compare the two is laughable. It tries to be funny yet fails miserably. It tries to be dramatic but, to borrow a Hinata quote from episode 4, \u201cyou didn\u2019t touch my heart\u201d. It tries to be unique above all else. I\u2019ll miss you, Angel Beats. I\u2019ll never witness another anime like you, except every single day when I browse on Amazon.com and see all the other spectacularly subpar school series. While finishing up Angel Beats and struggling to comprehend what I was exposing myself to, I thought of Shiina, specifically her catchphrase. Long after the show and the characters ceased feigning concern for the supporting cast, I thought of one of its least important members, a quiet, long-haired adolescent girl with an affinity for knives and a bizarre obsession for kittens. \u201cWhat was Shiina\u2019s catchphrase?\u201d, you might ask. \u201cThis is so stupid\u201d, and that is Angel Beats in a nutshell.\\n",

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\nIt's these kind of shows I hate. Oh no, not the kind of anime I literally hate, because of that's the case I can just pick up this Tommy-gun that just happens to be laying next to me and completely destroy the show's plot and characters. No, I'm talking about the kinds of anime that you can't help but like; something about the colorful characters and intriguing plot, or the excellent animation and brilliant OP, just grabs you, taking you on an emotional journey through the afterlife. Unfortunately though, it's also the kind of anime after you've finished it, look backon and think, \"Wait...how long did she have freakin' have to wait?!\"\\n\\n\r\n     Angel Beats is a 13-episode anime that aired all the way back in the spring of 2010. It was directed by Seiji Kishi, known for directing both my guilty pleasure Danganronpa, and Carnival Phantasm, a show I won't even try to begin to explain for fear of the schizophrenic opening driving me insane. The animation was handled by P.A Works, the animation studio who put themselves on the map with True Tears in 2008, and would go on to create the popular \"horror\"(these quotations are about the size of blimps by the way) anime Another in the year of 2012. The original story was conceived by the one and only Jun Maeda, who hasn't done anything more in the anime creation department, but did the music for series's such as Kanon(2006) and Clannad. Now with that out of the way, you might be asking yourself, \"what exactly is an Angel Beats?\". Well, let me explain...\\n\\n\r\nOur story begins with our orange haired hero Otanashi, waking up in a manner those who have played any RPG's would be rather familiar with. He has complete amnesia, and doesn't know where he is, who he is, and what the hell is going on, seeing that when he glances to his right, there appears to be a girl carrying a rather large gun. The girl introduces herself as Yuri, and informs Otanashi that he apparently went and got killed at some point, and is now in a high-school purgatory with Yuri and a number of other students that have died as well. Also, she seems to be pointing that gun at what she claims to be an \"angel\", but who looks like a normal girl to Otanashi. Understandably not quite understanding what exactly is happening, Otanashi approaches the \"angel\" despite Yuri's warnings, and sees if she can clear up anything. She too says that this is indeed purgatory, and just to convince Otanashi, she stabs him through the heart with a sword. Of course though, neither Yuri or Angel is insane or lying to Otanashi; this is purgatory, and that means you can't die. After waking up in hospital room, and not sure of what else to do, Otanashi joins up with Yuri's group the SSS, to fight Angel, and see if he can eventually recall memories from his own life and learn what tragic circumstances brought the rest of the school's occupants to this purgatory. He still finds himself drawn to Angel, why she acts the way she does, and if she is actually an angel, sent from God. The answer will affect Otanashi, and drag this entire purgatory high-school into a conflict with an outcome that will be unpredictable for everyone.  \\n\\n\r\n     Now as you can imagine, all these little mysteries make the first episode and premise of Angel Beats so interesting. There are ton of intriguing questions to be answered, and I found the characters, especially concerning the past of the unfair lives they led, a really interesting catalyst for character development, even if the show never really decided to go that way. Now, it's worth mentioning that the show follows a plan-of-the-week type setup, where Yuri would come up a plan to defeat or resist Angel, only to see it go wrong, at least for the first half of the show. These little adventures make up the bulk of the episodes, and yes are fun and entertaining while they last, showing the daily shenanigans of the SSS with fairly entertaining comedy, but here's where the main flaw of the show's plot and ideas comes into focus. The show completely lacks a sense of direction, going from one unrelated arc to the next, with no clear goal in mind. This means the final arc of the show has no build-up, makes the final villain a character we've never seen before, and suddenly ends as the show drops an emotional bombshell completely out of left field. And then the show just ends, like it forgot to tell us that, \"yeah, this is the finale by the way. k' thanks bye\". You'll get a clearer idea of what I mean when you go watch the show. This emotional bombshell tries to tie everything up at the end while fulfilling its manipulative plan to make the viewer cry. And yeah, you might cry at the end of the series, the freakin' emotional music playing and lens flares is practically engineered to make you cry, but this emotional twist at the end opens a plot-hole so big that it almost completely ruins the show for me, once I started to think about it after the show ended. \\n\\n\r\n     They might have been able to pull the ending(and the anime, off) with the proper steps, but here's the final problem with the show. It's too damn short. 13 episodes wasn't nearly enough time to fully explore the concepts of this afterlife, also taking into account developing the huge cast. This is why the story was so fast rushing through arc after arc, trying to fit everything it wanted in, and why the ending is just so sudden. I heard that the anime was originally supposed be twice the length it actually ended up being, so there's an explanation I suppose, but I can even think of a few filler episodes that could have been cut out without much missed, and at the very least could have been used as \"character episodes\". More on that later. \\n\\n\r\n     But yeah, all these problems stem from the show's short run time: the sudden end, the few lackluster characters, and the lack of direction. It's a shame too, because if P.A works had the time and episodes to do what they wanted, and fleshed out all the characters and setting, it could have been great. It just didn't turn out like that. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime has quite the large cast, which doesn't really help seeing that the show was already rushed. This leaves most of the characters with very straight-forward personalities, with nothing under the one trait they show us. However the show will occasionally take a break from digging plot-holes to concentrate on one character of the large cast, and this usually makes up the best parts of the entire show, which makes me feel like a character driven anime would have been the preferable direction, especially considering the lack of episodes. While the character episodes are fantastic(episode 3, 4, and 9 especially) I'll touch on them later, because I need to talk about the main cast, which ironically, might not be quite as good as some of the supporting cast. \\n\\n\r\n     First we need to talk about our main character Otanashi, whose bright orange hair might be his most distinguishing feature, because he who just might one of the most blandest people in the entire world. He's very reminiscent of Another's Keouchi, and Gosick's Kujo, a main character that just seems to be there to witness the narrative forward itself, instead of actually affecting it. All his actions are seemingly dictated by a \"Main Character Code of Conduct\" book; he stands up for what's right, he's noble, caring, etc. etc. My point is, all of his actions throughout the anime, except maybe at the very end, are everything any regular person would do, leaving his character just a blank slate, and nothing more interesting to be said for him. \\n\\n\r\n     The proud no-nonsense leader of the SS: Yuri, is much more interesting. Unlike Otanashi, she actually has motivation and development throughout the show, explaining her hatred towards God due to her severely tragic life. And I don't know if this is just me, but Yuri reminds me vividly of Haruhi from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, except without having god-like powers, and being slightly more sane, at least most of the time. I don't know.\\n\r\n     Lastly, we have the queen of \"kuuderes\" herself: Angel. Now, for almost the entire length of the series, she is the latest member of a group of characters I like to call: The Sisterhood of Rei Ayanami, which includes characters like Yuki Nagato from Haruhi, Mei Misaki from Another, and to some extent Inori from Guilty Crown. Yes, she is the seemingly emotionless character for the duration series, until we actually start to learn about her character at the end of the series, including that emotional bombshell at the end of the anime. However, despite this, I never felt she ever really broke out of her archetype, and the reasoning behind her emotionless personality wasn't a good enough explanation in my opinion. She become an alright character, but this problem really hurts her development, and her character overall. \\n\\n\r\n     Now the supporting cast finally give me something to talk about. When they aren't providing the comedy for the series, the side characters make up for the actually interesting characters. While of course, there isn't nearly enough time in the show to possibly development them all, the few that do get episodes to themselves are rather awesome. This is where the writing is the best, and as I said before, things might have gone more smoothly as a character-of-the-week show. Unfortunately, of course, once again due to the number of episodes most characters are ignored, but you become interested on what their story of why they're in this purgatory is. You always feel like there's more to them than what the show is showing us, and I found myself wanting to know the back story to more than a few characters, like Shiina and TK. I never got that back-story, but it's kind of fun to make up your own explanation, like maybe Shiina used to be Batman, and TK has a rare disease that if he stops dancing he dies. Point is, it was more fun to speculate on the side characters stories than it was to concentrate on the main character's, which you know, is kind of a shame. And when a side character does get a episode to themselves, like Yui or Hinata, Angel Beats becomes a legitimately really good show, making it all the more painful that we got so few of those episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nI've found P.A works has never failed to impress me before animation-wise, and that makes them one of my new favorite animation studios behind studio ufotable(though to be fair, ufotable is like, god). They've shown me a wide range of techniques with shows like Another, while still keeping the kind of animation that makes them P.A Works. With Angel Beats, no bars are held back, the animation looks superb, detail evident in every scene. I also really like the color palette of the show, which can range from grim dark to easy-on-the-eye bright colors, though I find the bright colors really is where the show shines. The action scenes where the SSS fight Angel are rather cool as well, though personally, I find them a little underwhelming compared to shows like Sword Art Online and Shakugan no Shana, though to be fair, those shows are more action oriented. Oh, don't worry Angel Beats, this doesn't mean I forgive you, there's more than one action scene in the anime and it really should be better at times. All in all, action is neither bad or good, so just call it \"meh\".\\n\\n\r\n     However if there is a time where the animation really can shine, it's during the concert scenes preformed by the school band: Girls Dead Monster. It looks absolutely superb, not only because a million things are moving at once, but because the music is synced up wonderfully with the instruments and players. There's not too many concert performances in the series itself, but I was more than happy to wait patiently for them when they came. Speaking or music, and speaking of superb...\\n\\n\r\nI've been disappointing by P.A Works when they handle music before, especially with Another, that OP made me want to slam my head into the wall until it stopped, but I'm am delighted to say that Angel Beats has no such short-comings. It's full of songs both rigid with emotion, and up-beat tracks to bring levity to the series. Key did a wonderful job making this soundtrack, so much so that when the writing fails, the music can be the deciding factor of emotional investment in a certain scene. Not all these tracks you will notice while you are actually watching the anime, but I recommend you to go back and listen to the OST by itself, like I did, and be pleasantly surprised by just how good some of these songs actually are. The only flaw in the soundtrack is that some of these songs can potentially sound alike, but I guess that comes to be expected when you need to produce 5+ emotional songs with the same vocalist. It happens. Personal favorites form this track include \"Theme of SSS\" and \"My Most Precious Treasure\". Of course you can't forgot the lovely opening, which features extremely high quality animation and a song that got stuck in my head for about two weeks.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to leave here saying that Angel Beats is a bad anime and you shouldn't watch it, because it isn't, but there is many legitimate problems here that really kill the show's chance of being anything more than a typical anime. What it had in music, animation, emotion, it lack in character, pacing and direction. Think of Angel Beats as a poorly made cookie: tastes good, but starts to crumble apart when you hold onto it for too long. My point is, the good of Angel Beats doesn't quite outweigh the bad, leaving an anime to watch and enjoy, but not one to praise and re-watch. What potential it had was killed by the short length of the thing, and ultimately soured what it did right. Perhaps a good anime if you're looking for an emotional pick-me-up, but not one that has any really quality. That's not to say it can't be good, even great at times, but it never lasts too long. \\n\\n\r\n     Well, with all that in mind, I bring this review to an end. In summary: Angel Beats. Good. Not great. Goodbye.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Seriously, how long did she have to wait?!!\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog! (Link on profile)",

            "content": "Fictional bullies are like real-life bullies to me in that we get along very poorly and I prefer to avoid them altogether. I have not and will never be able to tolerate that stupid fictional cliche because not only do I not consider it good conflict, but explain to me how it makes any sense that they can be dumb as bricks, and yet be able to always run into their victims out of nowhere like they\u2019ve got security cameras lined up across the entire city. And whilst I don\u2019t mind them if they\u2019re funny, comedy is a hellhole in general anime-wise, and most peoplewho make the stuff probably never even watched Back to the Future and laughed at the hilarity that is Biff Tannen. The only other alternative for me to accept that cliche is if you have a story that\u2019s focused on a bully, what makes him tick, why he has a particular grudge against this meek person, and how he\u2019s able to have so many friends who for some reason share the same train of thought as him. Never expected Jun Maeda of all people to be the one to write that story, but yes, Angel Beats is basically the \u201cstory about bullies\u201d that I\u2019ve wanted for a long time.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, having the bully and the victim be a Haruhi cosplayer and a little girl who can defend herself with Matrix-like powers wasn\u2019t exactly what I had in mind, but it makes sense when you think about it. Haruhi herself was a bully and whilst the irony of your victim being a lonely little girl who happens to be able to use weapons is nothing new, it\u2019s not a bad stereotype. I\u2019m fully aware that most people paid attention to Angel Beats whilst it was airing because of its setting and how the characters respond to it, but I say said setting and how it works is ultimately irrelevant at the end of the day. Yes, Angel Beats sets out to say the same things Haibane Renmei does (along with The Matrix, Lost, Cowboy Bebop, many other school comedies, etc.), but that doesn\u2019t invalidate my own reading of the show: that it\u2019s really an exaggerated metaphor for bullying where the bullies are the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is focused on Otonashi, an amnesiac who joins said bullies masquerading as freedom fighters called the SSS after a poor choice of wording caused him to see a little girl in the wrong light. Said group has had their own share of baggage, and thus take it out on that little girl because they need someone to blame and due to their blindness as well as a combination of their own talents and stupidity, they try to make things difficult for her at every opportunity and don\u2019t even bother to learn her real name \u2013 calling her Angel, or Tenshi if you want to be a weeaboo about it. Although Otonashi himself doesn\u2019t even know what his baggage is, it makes sense for him to join the group where he\u2019d have many supporters rather than few (well, one) and thus we get episodes of the SSS taking their frustrations out on Angel all under the justification of trying to confront God when in reality, they\u2019re just shooting a little girl they know can\u2019t die and thus they feel totally justified.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have to clarify that since this is a Jun Maeda anime, it\u2019s filled to the brim with his usual fetishes: low-IQ characters, laughably dramatic stories, characters loving baseball, decent dramatic soundtrack, derpy derpy doo. Unlike his previous works though, said fetishes actually add to the story rather than detract from it.\\n\\n\r\nThe SSS should offend you with their simple-minded behavior and missions that come off more like school activities. Angel Beats purposefully makes them do inconsequential things that won\u2019t matter in the long-term in order to showcase just how empty and pointless taking your anger out on something you ultimately can\u2019t see is, along with having them unknowingly experience the fun they thought they were above in the process. You don\u2019t have to bother explaining how the purgatory they are trapped in really works because it has little to no consequence on the overall story. You don\u2019t even have to bother putting that much effort into what happened in their past lives to justify their actions, because Angel Beats wants you to see that there is no justification whatsoever for being an asshole, and it\u2019s only when you accept that fact and grow up that you can succeed in life. This particularly comes to a head in the episode where the SSS takes their antics too far and end up ruining Angel\u2019s reputation in the school, only to realize that it was all for nothing and she\u2019s a normal girl with a normal name who only opposed them because they caused trouble first, causing Otonashi to side with her. From there, he appoints himself as the guy who wants to make his friends realize the same thing as him, give up on their empty hatred, and move on with their lives.\\n\\n\r\nExcept Otonashi isn\u2019t exactly the Jesus Christ he makes himself out to be. Even after he gains his memories of being an aspiring doctor, he can\u2019t fully control people\u2019s lives and is ultimately nothing more than a bit player in the grand scheme of things. He tries to get Angel accepted into the group, only for her powers to go out of control and ultimately distance herself from everyone else for a short time. Whilst he tries to make Yui happy so that she can move on, it is ultimately his blue-haired friend that satisfies her leftover wants. Everyone chooses for themselves what they want to do once the truth is forced out of him, and considering that they were already living a fun life with their missions against God long before he showed up, it makes sense that they\u2019d recognize what they want to do so easily. Even Yuri has to confront her inner demons on her own through some programmed NPC left by a previous denizen of this world. And finally, after the characters graduate from the high school life eager to accept their past whilst starting anew, he decides to invite the girl he loves to stay at this highschool just so they can both be bit players to other people\u2019s stories, only for said girl to reject his offer and move on without him. I\u2019m probably in the minority on this, but Otonashi crying like a baby when he realized how much that offer/declaration of love backfired on him was just hilariously ironic to me.\\n\\n\r\nSo Angel Beats appeals to me story-wise. It\u2019s just a pity it\u2019s not executed very well in regards to how it tells that story to me. Again, I\u2019m not talking about the plot details like how Angel could have possibly arrived at the purgatory before a certain somebody and how the rules of the world just keep changing willy-nilly and whatever that Matrix-moment in the penultimate episode was all about, because those don\u2019t really affect the story Angel Beats wants to tell when you get down to it. I\u2019m talking about the presentation choices, many of them due to having Seiji Kishi as the director.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll admit there were times where I laughed at the show\u2019s humor, which is pretty rare in terms of anime. TK is a funny dude and those rocket chairs were pretty genius. Unfortunately, a bunch of the comedy comes from the Fullmetal Alchemist school of comedy in that it creates jarring tonal shifts that are completely unnecessary and ruin the mood the show is going for at times, particularly that scene in Episode 9 when Otonashi discovers the truth behind Angel and the touching tone suddenly gets disrupted for an unfunny gag. And when it\u2019s not doing that, it\u2019s pointing out the show\u2019s own faults and then not bothering to really fix them, which isn\u2019t good meta-humor. That\u2019s just punching somebody and then saying that you punched somebody.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t exactly help that it also causes the characterization necessary for this kind of story to work to suffer at times. Whilst anime as a medium will never be able to really capture the personalities of real-life people, there\u2019s a difference between being girly and being lame, and the way Yuri acted after being relieved of her leadership duties was very much the latter. It\u2019s an extreme, but definitely not the only time where the characters\u2019 personalities are exaggerated too far in order to get a laugh, although surprisingly I never had a problem with the dramatic side of things. Maybe because for a Key anime, there wasn\u2019t much in the way of actual crying.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just to hammer the nail in, the production isn\u2019t all that. It\u2019s pretty decent for the most part, but there are a bunch of poor shots that would have embarrassed Deen at the time this came out.  The concert scenes are pretty good with lots of detail put into the way the hands move as well as how the actually pretty decent rock songs sync up to the characters\u2019 mouths, but the action is mostly crap. There are one or two instances where it looks cool, but the rest is poorly choreographed, shot way too close to the camera, and the two sides aren\u2019t even in the same scene for a majority of them that you might as well be watching those Expendables films if you just want some brainless action.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, that epilogue (the official one, not the one that came months later)\u2026well I don\u2019t dislike it because unlike what I\u2019ve heard of [C]\u2018s ending (I haven\u2019t seen that show), I don\u2019t think it really changed much of anything at the last minute. It wasn\u2019t like Kuragehime\u2019s awful finale where it basically rewarded its cast of bullies for their terrible behavior. It\u2019s just a chance reunion between two people who haven\u2019t seen each other in a long time and considering many years had to have passed, I don\u2019t have any reason to assume that this reunion along with the fact that the characters seem to be living fine after all they\u2019ve been through was unearned. We don\u2019t even really see what happens as a result of it. Nevertheless, I still think it was unnecessary to show.\\n\\n\r\nStill for all its problems and despite my commenters saying otherwise, I quite liked Angel Beats in the end. Ha! See that PA Works? If you would quit wasting your time on character masturbation and focused more on drama that actually moves things along and has something interesting to say, I wouldn\u2019t flat-out ignore you like I usually do! I do admit that a large part of my enjoyment for the show comes from how much I despise what fiction does to the \u201cbully character\u201d the same way a few people enjoy Daily Lives of Highschool Boys because they don\u2019t like the \u201ccute girl\u201d genre it\u2019s mocking, and whilst I think Otonashi\u2019s hypocritical philosophy is played out well enough, it\u2019s not perfectly executed and you may find the faults in it more annoying than I did. It\u2019s definitely something I like more for what it could have been and I would have preferred a script and direction that\u2019s a little less hokey (it could be argued that Flowers of Evil is like that, but I say that\u2019s more a twist on the whole love triangle story), so take my judgment for what it\u2019s worth.",

            "content": "Angel Beats! is held by many as one of the greats. I do agree with this statement. But what exactly makes it good? I will do my best to try to explain and maybe make you understand this anime and it's fans a bit more.\r\nAngel Beats is about a group of teenagers who after their death found themselves trapped in an after-life school for reasons not truly known to them. What unites them is that they all died young and lived through much saddnes during their short lives. As soon as they come in terms with the saddness they lived through, they vanish from thisworld. \\n\\n\r\nUnder a leadership of one girl they unite to fight the unfairness they lived through and find God or anyone who is responsible for this sitiuation.\\n\\n\r\nThis series to me is a symbol. A symbol of fighting unfairness. Staying strong no matter what happened toyou. With these characters you go through this school from which you can graduate only when you have faced your grief and decided to not get consumed by it. As you watch this show you see how the characers who may start bitter and angry on the things that happened to them, slowly accept them, grow up, mature and learn to stand up and be strong. \\n\\n\r\nIt is interesting that the school has been chosen as a setting. One might say thag it is cliche especially for anime, but here it serves as a symbol too. It is a school of life in which you learn to overcome things and can only graduate when you faced the fears and bitterness, and rose above them. This way the series teaches you not to hate life no matter what happens to you.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters on this show are likable and you genuenly care for them. Still the anime could benefit from more episodes, as quite a few of the characters have not been developes to their full extent. It does not worsen the experience of the show, but it is still notable. Still the characters that are developed to their full extebt are all likable and you get really attached to them, which makes it all harder to say goodbye. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation, design and overall austetics of the show are magnificent. It looks colorful, nice and never fails to set the right mood, wether fun or sad. \\n\\n\r\nTo top the good characters and nice austetics, the show has a killer of a soundtracks which includes both a beautiful instrumentals and magnificent original aongs with lyrics. You will return to this majestic soundtrack more than once belive me. I still find myself returning to it every now and then.\\n\\n\r\nNow the show has a few flaws. For one there is a significant plot hole at the end. It ia explained in the manga and I already knew that explanation so it did not ruin my experience. Still the manga and said explanation came after the original show so a lot of people had to experience it without any explanation. As I said the show coukd definitly use at least a few more episode to really show off the interedting characters who sadly did not get their moment to shine.\\n\\n\r\nStill overall this show is highly enjoyable, deep, funny, tragic and engaging. I have had a great time watching it. It really appealed to me on personal level but even beyond that I consider this a very strong show. I urge you to give it a chance.",

            "content": "*This review is spoiler-free*\r\nI first heard of Angel Beats from one of my friends. She spent hours raving about how amazing this anime was an how it inspired her. After seeing dozens of positive reviews online, I decided to check it out, for it seemed to fit all of my interests . I went into the series with high hopes and expectations, thinking that it would become one of my favorite animes, and I couldn't have been more disappointed.\r\nThe anime had so much potential. It really did. But it was played so safely. If Key Visual Arts had actually put in some effort to pushthings out of the norm and not rely completely on all the common otaku-pleasing tropes and archetypes, it could have been great.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 1/10\\n\r\nAngel Beats doesn't really rely on plot. Instead, it focuses on humor and characterization. Which is probably a good thing, considering how dull and generic the story line is. Essentially, a teen boy winds up at a school and is pulled into a questionable organization/group/club by a tsundere girl named Yuri. This group, known as the SSS, fights a mysterious girl known as Angel. Nothing slightly new or original. Except that apparently the school is in purgatory. This all happens in the first couple minutes, and no real exposition is given. \\n\\n\r\nEach episode focuses either on the back story of a single character, explaining how they died, or on the various plans which Yuri puts the members of the SSS into. This isn't exactly a bad idea, but it isn't something that can be effective in only 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation is impressive. Nothing mind blowing, but still very well done. The action scenes were well choreographed and attention grabbing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe opening theme, \"My Soul, Your Beats\" was incredible. However, I personally did not enjoy any of the insert songs very much. There is a band known as Girl's Dead Monster which often plays concerts throughout the series. I didn't really care for them. They weren't bad, but it was nothing memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nThe cast in Angel Beats is without a doubt my least favorite cast of characters  from any anime which I have seen.\\n\r\nThey were all incredibly generic. Most of them either fit into one common archetype or were essentially a walking piece of cardboard. (T.K. and Masami Iwasawa are really the only two exceptions I noticed. They also were the only characters I really liked.) There was also a complete lack of character development.\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier in the review, many of the episodes were dedicated to the back story a single character. (I'm under the impression that this was supposed to serve as a replacement for the character development.) The back stories were pretty original for the most part, but they just didn't do anything for me. I felt no sympathy for the characters after hearing about their tragic death because their deaths weren't really that tragic. Every back story was either not believable or was simply just the character's own fault. (Iwasawa was an exception to this. She had a solid backstory which was actually emotional.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nAngel Beats relied on being either humorous or tear jerking. The problem was, it wasn't funny and I simply felt annoyed while watching it, not the slightest bit sad. I really wanted to feel the roller coaster of emotions which so many others supposedly felt. I even tried to force myself to laugh or cry a few times. And it didn't work. At all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nI feel really generous with this score.\\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: Angel beats had lots of potential but was poorly executed and little effort was put into creating something unique and fresh. In general, the anime was just frustrating to watch. Also: I cringe whenever someone describes it as \"original.\"",

            "content": "Comedy, romance, action, musical, drama, supernatural. It's hard to find an anime with all those genres. In Angel Beats!, you can have it all.\r\nI remember watching this in early 2011. I was captivated since the very first scene. \r\nStory: (10/10)\r\nAmazing. Just amazing. It was funny, inspiring, striking, and heartbreaking all at the same time. It may look like it doesn't have continuity, but it actually does. Each and every episode will keep you begging for more. The plot immediately rises from the first scenes in Episode 1, and the all the events that follow will not disappoint the viewer.\r\nArt: (10/10)\r\nGun animations, piano playing, guitar rocking:it was detailed magnificently. The fight scenes, the angling of a scene, even the opening animations were all amazing. I praise P.A. Works for doing an excellent job in animating the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (10/10)\\n\r\nOpening theme and ending theme was perfect for the series. It suits it well. The voices of marina, Lia, LiSA and Karuta were all very magnetizing. As well as the other musical scores that plays, especially Theme of SSS, which was by far the best music ever released by an anime. It's literally my alarm tune. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (9/10)\\n\r\nYuri, Yuzuru, Yui, and Kanade. They are just a few people who will really put you in tears. Not to mention Naoi, Iwasawa, and the others, too. What made it lose a point for me is that not all the characters had their story told. I would've wished to see and witness all their struggles in life and their determination and decision to finally go on and live their life to full extent. But, other than that, all characters were introduced well, has participated adequately, and were not less important than the others.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10)\\n\r\nEnjoyment? I don't think it had one non-enjoyable part. You'll laugh, you'll be in tears, you'll be rocking with Girls Dead Monster. It wasn't just enjoyable, it was totally enjoyable. It has a high amusement level, and will rise as each scene follows.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Angel Beats! is an anime worth watching. It's fun, it's inspiring, and besides the action and gun-pointings, it's family-friendly. Lol. Also, once you watch it, you'll have a different view in life.",

            "content": "I've heard a lot about Angel Beats! over the years, with many people recommending it and talking about how depressing the ending is especially. I finally got around to it and I felt it was a bit of a waste of time. The characters aren't super well developed (with only 13 episodes the creators really didn't give themselves enough time to fully develop everyone), the story is overall pretty weak, and the concepts aren't explained well. \r\nAngel Beats! is definitely a character driven series, but I didn't feel like the characters were even that great to begin with. Some of the characters were actually prettyannoying, which I understand that's just something that comes to be expected with anime, but I found characters like Yui to be much better/more likable/more realistic than others like Naoi. Yui was defined by a certain trait, which was her energy. Naoi was so bent on the fact that he was god to the point where it didn't even make sense why. It was made clear that he'd abandoned that idea, and although it was funny the first time, it got annoying real quick and made him feel a lot less real that he could have been. Maybe it's just because I prefer the character type that Yui is, but nevertheless hearing Naoi throwing around the 'I am god' line in the last episode really made it difficult to care about him. Some relationships (specifically all the romantic ones) felt extremely forced, and all happened near the end. They felt rushed, when two characters might be hating each other and constantly fighting one moment, the next they fall in love out of absolutely nowhere. It just didn't make sense to me how it suddenly just appeared. I was happy that they didn't give into the anime clich\u00e9 of every character spilling out their life story in the first few episodes for no apparent reason, which added to the character development more than it did take away. The characters didn't all feel the same in that they're all just a bunch of kids who can't control their emotions. Plus it gets awfully tedious to have to listen to a new life story every twenty-five or so minutes, especially if your only just introduced to these characters.\\n\\n\r\nWith a story as unique as this one, it would be kind of hard to get it right, but that doesn't excuse the fact that it wasn't well done. The creators took a risk and it didn't work out. The coolness of the idea gives it some extra points in my book, but it wasn't carried out well. It definitely could have been better if the creators had worked a bit harder. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1/10",

            "content": "Everyone's life is unfair. You can't deny it. There's probably been times when you've cursed the world for giving you the life you have. And more times than not, you have a perfectly justified reason for doing so. Even I, one of the happiest people in the world (not), has felt this way before. However after I watched this, I gained a little more respect for the life I'm living.\r\nIf you were too lazy (like I was) to read the synopses, then basically this story is about a guy named Otonashi that wakes up with amnesia only to learn that he's dead. With no ideawhere to go or what to do, he joins the Afterlife Battlefront, which is a group of people that have been sent to the Afterlife as well. Eventually you start to learn that everyone there has had a tragic past and curses God because of it. Because of this, the only way to get out of the Afterlife is to reconcile with your past until you have no regrets or hate. Once you're able to do this, you can move on.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the anime seems to be very dark, in actuality it's quite far from it most of the time. The story takes place in a school setting and it's usually very light-hearted and funny. Oh sorry did I say funny? I meant REALLY FUNNY! I haven't laughed so much in a long time and while I can see some people getting annoyed by repeating gags, I never got tired of them. When you're not laughing, you're most likely crying. If you didn't know, for many people this is/has come close to being the saddest anime they've watched and for good reason. Remember back in the beginning of this review when I said how everyone's life is unfair? Well this anime really takes that into account and creates stories for the characters that is strangely relatable to us and it can really mess with your emotions.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I really liked were the characters. None of them were boring and they all had personality. Well everyone except one, but she's an angel or she's supposed to be an angel, so she's got to act all angelic like. But yeah I felt like they were the ones that really made the show. Some characters you just knew that they were gonna say something stupid, but funny as soon as you see them, while others could be all serious then just change to something completely different then their personality.\\n\\n\r\nI am aware that there are some plotholes, but unless you're a person that is like overly obsessed with looking for problems in anime, then you should have no trouble with this. All in all it probably wasn't my favorite anime, but its definitely in my top five favorites.",

Live our lives and follow our hearts\u2026 so when our time comes we won\u2019t regret anything.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Everything I have to say about Angel Beats! can be summed up in my newest review via YouTube @ \\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiOhv9b9y9U&feature=youtu.be\\n\r\nOr you you Prefer the written form (Boring)... simply look down\\n\\n\r\nImagine a perfect life for yourself, filled with everything you ever wanted, imagine living in a world where everything you had ever hoped for came true, imagine meeting your life time goals and ultimately making yourself happy, imagine being surrounded by everyone you love, honestly try to imagine it\u2026 Now imagine all of that being taken away from you, all of your hard work just thrown to the wind, everything that you put your life toward accomplishing just taken away from you in an instant, losing everything and everyone you wanted to protect in this world in a matter of seconds, think how devastating that must be, to have all of your happiness taken away, to have everything you worked so hard for and believed in destroyed in the blink of an eye, imagine the type of sadness that this creates, having everything, everything your ever held dear taken in this unjust way for no real purpose or reason\u2026 Imagine everything that had ever made you smile in life disappeared; imagine how meaningless and pointless your life would become after these tragedies, and finally imagine dying without doing or changing anything about this, and there you have the lingering emotion of angel beats\u2026\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\nSo today we are going to be doing a group discussion review or whatever you want to call it on the popular anime Angel Beats! We will be discussing and rating them the topics of angel beats such as Story, Character development, Visual Arts and effects, as well as Music, and basic overall viewer enjoyment. And our life time goal is to get through this entire review without crying\u2026 \\n\\n\r\nIntroductions: \\n\r\n OK so Angel Beats is a multi-release project produced by Key studios, which has brought us amazing titles such as Air, Kanon, and Clannad. It consists of an anime and manga series, novel as well as a Comic. However, the 13 episode anime series was also produced P.A Works, Aniplex, Visual Art\u2019s, and licensed by Sentai Filmworks.  Angel Beats is a Supernatural Action Comedy that also takes you on a personal emotional rollercoaster throughout the entire series.\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nAngel Beats takes place at a high school in the afterlife although they are dead they still experience the natural human sensations, such as hunger and pair  yet in this high school the student body consists of NPCs, non-player characters, which are humanoid interfaces without souls                  and then there are the students with souls that are in the world with a purpose, each with a different past life but all of them are here to release lingering emotions from an unjust life.\\n\r\n\u2026 And it is these Lingering emotions that keep them here in this world from passing on to their next life. This ultimately brings them to the main plot with the Afterlife Battlefront, where the Students with lingering emotions fight against God because of their unjust lives. The initial story starts as Otanashi awakens without any memories from his past life due to an occurring case of amnesia.  He is first greeted by Yuri Nakamura otherwise known as Yurippe and so the story of Angel beats Began\u2026 \\n\r\nCharacter Developments: \\n\r\nYuri Nakamura- Yurippie starts as an ultimate commando badass as the leader of the Afterlife Battle front, who comes off as a strong minded, level headed, determined leader and at times has a psychotic mind. She created this campaign to justify god's role in her own tragic life. However, Yurippie ends up labeling angel as the main enemy of the afterlife battle front\\n\r\nAngel- Kanade Tachibana\u2026  However, there are always two sides to every story, Angel is the supposed right hand man to God, but her real name Is Kanade Tachibana.  Who starts off as the school\u2019s Student Council President, which deems her as an enemy because she enforces the normal behavior of high school by suppressing disruptive activities. However she is not as defenseless as she first seems. Angel contains incredible strength, comes of seeming indestructible, and can use extraordinary abilities in combat. You will definitely understand more about this character as she develops in the series.\\n\r\n Ayato Naio- This brings us to Ayato Naio, the Student Council Vice President, who was originally thought to be a NPC, but as the story progresses you realize he has his own dark past and reasons for coming into this world. He develops as a character that seems to have some intelligence but ends up as a comic relief for this otherwise depressing anime. Not to mentions that he is yet another narcissistic asshole that you will learn to respect by the end of the show and he has to be my favorite character from the show oddly enough.\\n\r\nHinata- We can move on to Hinata the 2nd official member of the \u201cWe\u2019re not yet Dead Battlefront,\u201d He was the one who started it with Yuri. He is an overall great guy that everyone wants to have as a best friend, and Otonashi gains that privilege. Yet, like so many others in the story he has lingering emotions from his previous life.\\n\r\nIwasawa- Then there is Masami Iwasawa the cool, beautiful, and talented lead singer of the Battlefront\u2019s diversion team, Girls Dead Monster, otherwise known as Girls Demo. Not to mention that the band itself is a fantastic part of the actual OST\u2026 \\n\r\nYui- This brings us to Yui the polar opposite of Iwasawa cool and mature personality. She is the energetic and playful part of Girls Demo who debuts as a great singer in episode 4. She is yet another great source of comic relief for the show as it hits you with the emotional bus we call feelings.  \\n\\n\r\nOtonashi- Then last but not least is Otonashi, the main character that this anime revolves around. But as mentioned before, he leaves little development in the show because of his occurring case of amnesia. However, the writers added this character in perfectly; because he becomes our gate way into this mysterious world know as Angel Beats. This created one of the greatest hooks I have ever seen in a show.  However, as the story progresses we see the character play a bigger role in the series when the anime gets deeper into every aspect, all the way up until episode 13.\\n\r\nAngel Beats is defiantly a show that made me feel like I was inside of the story, instead of sitting down watching one. Not to mention that Angle Beats accomplished so much for a 13 episode single-season show, that some longer one\u2019s failed to ever do. And it is just a story that everyone needs to see.  \\n\r\nVisual Arts and Effects\\n\r\nSpeaking of seeing the show, the animation is just so indescribably awesome, that I cannot put it into words. Everything is just so beautiful that it is rather hard to complain about the graphics. Especially considering that the fight scenes and backgrounds look so fantastic that I would find it hard to believe if someone didn\u2019t hand polish every atom in the background. Angel Beats looks so outstanding that it is almost on Fate/ Zero\u2019s level of excellence if it isn\u2019t already there.  \\n\r\nI really like the Animation for its details on the explosions, guns, backgrounds, and battles. Not to mention how beautiful the intro\u2019s animation is. Angle Beats is truly a visual masterpiece.\\n\r\nMusic\\n\r\nNow moving on to Music and you cannot talk about Angel Beats\u2019s music without mentioning its intro. And it is one of the greatest intros in Anime History, or at least in my opinion it is, because not only does it look phenomenal its music is great too. \\n\r\nAnd with the already announced Girls Demo the sound track is just so wonderful and beautiful. But may I also add that I Love EVERY SINGLE SONG from this sound track, so much so, that I have about 90%  of the songs in my iTunes library, and there has not been a week in my life that I have not listened to my 2 favorite tracks Unjust life and the SSS theme. The music is such a HUGE part of the show that you could listen to the sound track of Angel Beats over school days and it will be over 9000x better, but 9000 times zero is still zero sadly. However, you should take to accustom that this is my number one favorite soundtrack of all time. But that\u2019s only because Angel beats used every single song 99.99% perfectly in the series, making every emotion displayed through the songs\\n\r\nSubbed or Dubbed: \\n\r\nOn The Subject of Subbed or Dubbed: JUST FUCKING WATCH IT\u2026 seriously both are equally great, especially on every single emotional level that could ever exist. However, I like the dub .5% more because the voice actors really sound American to me. \\n\\n\r\nOpinion: \\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t figured it out yet I love this show with a passion. However, I understand that no one show is perfect. But at the same time I\u2019m not going to point out every single personal flaw with the show, just because it did not live up to my previous set expectations after watching a different anime. I\u2019M TALKING ABOUT YOU TRISTAN! I know the flaws behind the show, but I was able to put it behind myself and see the show for what it was\u2026 And that is a great story. Sure it was too short, but the story developed enough with the plot in that short amount of time that it had more than other shows \u201chigh school DxD\u201d can do in 2 seasons. Sure the show might not be able to cover its vast amount of characters in this time, but how the few select characters where focused on was phenomenal. Not to mention I credit the show on what it could do in the small time space. Yes the entire plot, although flawed in some ways, managed to build up enough emotional tension to it that would lead many people to cry over the course of the show and especially at the end\u2026 I know people who didn\u2019t cry at all and as heartless as that might seem to me, it\u2019s understandable. I too use to believe I was a man of steel uninhibited by the foolish emotion of heartbreak, but Angel Beats like everything else from key\u2026 got me and there is only one word that can describe the ending of Angel Beats for me. And for that I congratulate Angel Beats because the ending hit me\u2026 like a\u2026 um what\u2019s the word\u2026 \u201cWreaking ball\u201d thank you Miley. Some people out there have this mindset that it\u2019s just an anime, quit being a pussy\u2026 and I understand the criticism but there is a moment where an anime becomes much more than \u201cjust\u201d an anime isn\u2019t there. \\n\r\nBecause Angel Beats taught me a very important life lesson, it made me realize that no matter what is waiting for us on the other side, we must accept it and not fear death because everything has a time limit and we were given the chance to live, experience, and witness the wonderful world we have. If we would look past through our flaws, we will be able to live happy fulfilled lives. Live our lives and follow our hearts\u2026 so when our time comes we won\u2019t regret anything. \\n\r\nOk so instead of giving you a regular numerical rating I am going to leave you with a bit of advice and that is to just watch the show, because it is just a show that, once again, everyone needs to see. So much show that I honestly believe that it can be a good gate way anime for anyone new to the fan base or just a great watch for any regular otaku \\n\r\n And those are my final words for the review hope you all had a Merry Christmas and hope you will carry this message on for the New Year\\n",

            "content": "This is my first time writing a review, so please bear with me.\r\nI personally think that Angel Beats is a great anime.  Why?  \r\nThe story somewhat intrigues a person thought of what might be there after you die?  It makes a person also wonder what other people might be experiencing.  Is it good, or is it unreasonable.  Also, it has the elements that a person would want normally.  Action, comedy, slice of life, and maybe even romance for those who dig into those.  \r\nThe artwork is great.  It seems like every scene took a lot of effort.The CGI during the animation, and the opening sequence are both really good.  \\n\\n\r\nThe music in this anime is also very well played, in my opinion.  The sfx match the scene and the voice actors/actresses play their parts very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great.  The main lead, Otonashi Yuzuru seems to be the main focus of the character development category.  Same with Tachibana Kanade, the antagonist in the earlier episodes.  The character's personality is like in real life, except of course all the special abilities.  You have a leader that seems to be strong in the appearance, but maybe a little weak in the inside.  Mysterious people that makes a person wonder what they are like and what's their history.  Silent characters who you just want to love and know about.  And of course the normal people who seem to adapt to everything and try to make things better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment...  It is very much enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think Angel Beats is very good.  Although it will not surpass my current top favorite, it is worth while watching.  I like stories that have some questions in them.  Again, I apologize if this wasn't a proper review.  It is my first time after all.",

            "content": "You're dead. You don't have to take my word for it either. Go talk to that girl down there... Yeah, the one with the silver hair. (There are no other people around, after all.) I'm sure she'll do a nice job of killing you. Again.\r\nOf course, nobody stays dead in purgatory, which is the humor of Angel Beats!. \r\nThe anime is set in a high school, where the majority of people aren't people at all, but non-player characters designed to persuade you that the high school is a reality. Once you accept that the high school is a reality, and begin to enjoy life withinits confines, you are \"obliterated,\" meaning you leave the world of purgatory.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is definitely the weak point of Angel Beats!. Many times, the anime withholds crucial details, or introduces ideas and presumes to expand on them later, but never does. \\n\\n\r\nIn other words, Angel Beats! lacks continuity, and fails to expand upon or think of key details. What happens when you leave the high school grounds? Is there a larger world, or are you brought back to the high school? How did (x) die? We don't get many back stories on key characters- they're just sort of \"there\". \\n\\n\r\nFor thirteen (technically fourteen, including the special) episodes, this show lacks much follow-up. As such, it plays out less like a story and more like a large collection of concepts.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong- it has a plot line. The plot line just isn't coherent enough.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of Angel Beats! is good. In fact, the animation is one of the reasons I started watching Angel Beats!, though not because the art style is revolutionary or exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I look for an anime, I like to find familiarity, and Angel Beats! had that familiarity in the form of its art style. The illustration is similar to Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, another show I've reviewed and would highly recommend. \\n\\n\r\nSo while the animation style is not revolutionary or ground-breaking, it certainly doesn't detract from the show. The often light-hearted and comedic air that Angel Beats! has is captured well in its illustration. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nYou can almost watch Angel Beats! for its sound alone. The soundtrack to this show is exceptional. I'm not going to make ignorant pretenses, because anime is a new genre for me, but the intro to the anime is extraordinary in my humble opinion. The background music for the show is often quite catchy, and the ending theme for the show, coupled with its animation sequence, is enough to make you feel sad that the episode has ended and to go looking for more. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, Angel Beats! is based around its music, as is implied by its name. The band, Girls Dead Monster, (GDM) is a fairly significant part of this show. \\n\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, the idea of a music-centered anime turned me off at first. When I watched it, and found out that Angel Beats! meant that it was probably going to have a lot to do with music, I thought that it meant that it wasn't going to do as much with plot, and I was partly right, but for the wrong reasons (see above.) This show really doesn't do enough with its band, but then again, you can't expect too much in thirteen episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in Angel Beats! is outstanding. It complements the show extraordinarily well, and can almost stand on its own. Beyond that, I often watch this show over just to see the introductory sequence, which is really quite enchanting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nThis story lacks much character development, which is another one of its drawbacks. At times, this has a fair amount to do with the plot of the show, because the show juggles too much at once. Often, characters are introduced who have no real back story and who only come up once more in the series, if at all. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, the characters in the show also add to it a fair amount, especially TK. TK is a stock character, who often says the most outrageous things, and who is a \"mystery man\" with an unknown back story. He adds a fair amount of humor to the show, and it's characters like him, who only add to the comedy of the show, that make Angel Beats! worth watching. I only wish the forces behind this show would have developed their characters more...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nTo say I enjoyed Angel Beats! would be an understatement. The show made me laugh. The show made me cry (and I almost never cry). I anticipate that I'll be watching this many times over. In fact, I am now. And I'm wearing socks.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats! lacks many of the things that make a good show- character development, a coherent plot, etc. \\n\\n\r\nAnd yet for some reason, you can forgive it for that. Perhaps it's the beauty or the depth of the show itself, which poses questions about what it's like to be human, or whether or not you're prepared for death. Perhaps it's the music of the show, which could almost carry it completely. \\n\\n\r\nEither way, Angel Beats! is worth watching. You shouldn't expect much in the way of answers to the questions that the show puts forth, but you should expect a great deal of enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, the creator of Angel Beats! claims a second season is on the horizon. Some presume that this is all talk, but supposedly the show is coming out this spring. The cast list is completely different, which is a disappointment, but maybe this next season will still answer some key questions that the first season never answered.\\n\\n\r\nIn the meantime, I'll be finding more anime to watch and reading the show's manga, which might also provide some insights into the show itself.",

            "content": "\"Angel Beats!\" \u2013 a mix of huge amount of genres(action, comedy, drama, romance, supernatural, music, school and more) in a 13 ep series. Sounds bad doesn\u2019t it? How can something that tries to mix so many genres in only 13 eps be any good? Surprisingly its not only good, but pretty damn amazing, although not by any means flawless. \r\nArt 8+/10\r\nThe art of \"Angel Beats!\" is really good, the animation is fluid, both fighting scenes, and the concerts look outstanding. The art itself is also great, albeit it doesn\u2019t reach the level of Kyoto Animation it comes quite close. Especially female characters look really niceand original, unfortunately males(excluding T.K.) are rather bland in their design, Backgrounds(which is the are usually treated as an afterthought) are really detailed and diverse.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile \"Angel Beats!\" doesn\u2019t really belong to musical genre(only a few first episodes have music as one of the central themes), sound is very important in the series. Multiple songs played by the in-show band(\"Girls Dead Monster\"), are truly a great feast for both your eyes and ears, the background music playing is remarkable as well, especially during the sad scenes. The opening and ending also deserves a mention \u2013 both being great. The voice acting is also really solid, especially memorable is Kanade's voice actress performance(Hanazawa Kana).\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat happens if you die? Well if you are Otonashi Yuzuru - the main hero of \"Angel Beats!\" you end up in a world consisting of a High School filled with NPCs (soulless puppets resembling humans), and after you graduate there you will be obliterated and disappear... Obviously not everyone is happy with that - a ragtag band under a strong willed girl \u2013 Yuri forms SSS(Afterlife Battlefront) fighting to defy their fate by using guns(against mysterious girl only known as Tenshi) and by... failing tests.\\n\r\n\"Angel Beats!\" plot consists of two parts(which are not separated, the transition from first to second is gradual and unnoticeable). The first part \u2013 is mostly comedy mixed with action and elements of music genre, while the second part is drama, action and a bit of romance. So if you are not a fan of comedy you shouldn\u2019t drop the series, the drama part is really good. The biggest flaw of \"Angel Beats!\" Plot is the length of the series itself \u2013 the anime feels rushed in some parts, only a few characters get the screentime they deserve. The cast of the characters deserved better - we never learn about why they are here. Speaking of characters\u2026\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9+/10\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of \"Angel Beats!\" is probably one of its strongest points, the characters are really diverse, even the male lead which initially might seem like a boring cliche, ends up having really interesting past. It's impossible to tell why most of the characters are interesting but believe me: almost everyone will surprise you. The only problem is some of the original characters don\u2019t have their backstory explained, or just don\u2019t get enough screentime. \"Angel Beats!\" really should have been 24 ep. series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9+/10\\n\\n\r\nI have enjoyed \"Angel Beats!\" immensely, especially the second, drama focused part. That doesn\u2019t mean the first part is boring, far from it, the second part is just much more engaging( to me personally), almost everyone watching will end up marathoning the series after certain event.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this show to pretty much anyone, the mix of the genres ensures everyone will find something they enjoy, and the really likeable cast will keep you emotionally engaged. Almost all of \"Angel Beats!\" flaws are the result of the series being only 13 episodes long. \"Angel Beats!\" could have been a masterpiece well worthy of 10/10, but because of the length it ends up \u201conly\u201d amazing.",

            "content": "Ahh Angel Beats, each day that passes by after watching Angel Beats leaves me stunned. I can't simply forget how great this anime is and how much influence this anime had on me. You may be wondering how can a anime have influence on somebody? Well it may be that I fell in-love with the OP song in a instant and couldn't get enough of it. The great use of the acoustic music is this anime is amazing. I was so influenced by the song \"ichiban no takaramono\" that i practiced several hours on the piano every day to perfect the song.\r\nThis anime was sobeautiful and im so sad it actually ended. Ive laughed and ive cried   gotten attached to the characters and when it ended i felt empty. Every character that enter the afterlife has their own background story. Which i found really interesting to know see how the different characters died and cooped with their death. The way the anime builds up is kind of expected. A misunderstanding which will spiral in something good. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was fluorescence and lively which i think makes a good comedy/romance/action anime. I personally like when anime is bright and cheery. I really recommend watching it if you are looking for a bit of action/romance/comedy. This anime is just simply great and there isn't much to hate about it. Some might not like it due to the childish look of the anime. I think its personal preference and it might not even affect some people.",

            "content": "AngelBeats! was a very mediocre anime to my opinion. To start off, the characters are very generic, meaning that most of the characters attitudes & behaviors and are so predictable. There was uniqueness to little of the characters as in their back round story. The setting was very 50/50 on how I felt about it. It was a very new approach setting it in a purgatorial 'world' but setting it in a high school threw off the meaning of the setting. It's very confusing why they would go back to high school. I think it overthrew the whole setting and ruined it by suddenly beingset in a high school. Also, the plot was rushed very quickly. Otonashi fell in love with Kanade in 3 episodes. You know nothing of most of the character's stories so the you couldn't be sentimentally attached to the characters in a deeper aspect. The comedy is so over barring. The comedy takes away from the whole story and it's meaningless. The visuals are beautifully done though, a very praised part of this anime. Overall, not a favorite and not a recommendation.",

            "content": "Okay, base on the point system from part one I gave straight 10s.  Not because am a super fan-boy or anything, but because I felt like that is what it deserves.  It is able to shine in every episode in any way that it can.  It can be happy, sad, funny, but never really stupid.\r\nStory: Like any show, the main elements are story and characters.  The art and sound can either support or hamper them.  In this it supports it.  Not to go into too spoilers, or any really.  It is well written.  It finds a wayto make everything important.  Minor details that I thought didn't matter turned out to be important, an the already important details actually has a deeper meaning.  The story can be random at times, but it does a way that really flows.  And for random moments to have a flow, it isn't a easy task.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  They are unique to every anime in a way.  With technology improving, the art is only going to get better.  Here everything has a certain style.  All characters has their own style.  Everything else fits in, it has a good style to where people fit in the surroundings but don't get lost in it.  As for the animation aspect, it fits.  It only has one animation flow, but every shows has at least one.  However, it does not change the fact that this is a good flowing and visual art style.  It would be lower if it did not work well with the music.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  Okay this does have a English Dub version and I have watched both, but I'll get into details of that later.  What pulled me most into this series wasn't the story or characters but the music it used.  It was beautiful.  It also worked into the animation very strongly.  I give an example, but I don't want to spoil it.  The music, to me, is the most memorable thing in this.  And it really works into the show.  Also everything is on queue.  No delay sounds, it gives general ideas as to what the mood of the moment is.  All very fitting.  Voice Actors really know how to sell their characters.  Also the dub version does a really good job, no one is really bland in this, even the bland characters, but they do have good reason to be bland.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  Story is a good thing to have, but you need characters to drive it forward.  Angel Beats is on no shortage of that.  Every character is diverse, and if you are unable to relate to them, you will most certainly understand them.  Again I want to go into more detail, but I don't want to spoil it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is one of the best I have seen.  13 episode, all great, and all memorable.  None of them has a real weak episode and it always keeps the plot going.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I would recommend this to anyone.",

While most anime explains the situation as the story unfolds, Angel Beats remains confusing and somewhat nonsensical throughout the plot, leaving the audience to simply derive their own conclusions. While the plot does contain sentimental aspects, most of the story jumps around from one idea to the next and back again without truly concluding each thought, and the characters adapt to the situation with inhuman ease that makes them difficult to relate to. Angel Beats also leaves manyplot holes in the story, such as; (SPOILER ALERT) having a character live longer due to an organ donor but existing in the afterlife far before the donor dies. (END SPOILER) Overall, the anime is confusing, boring, and inconsistent, and therefore not a suitable choice for a thrill-loving anime audience.",

A rifle-toting girl named Yuri explains that they are in the afterlife, and Otonashi realizes the only thing he can remember about himself is his name. Yuri tells him that she leads the Shinda Sekai Sensen (Afterlife Battlefront) and wages war against a girl named Tenshi. Unable to believe Yuri's claims that Tenshi is evil, Otonashi attempts to speak with her, but the encounter doesn't go as he intended.\r\nAngel Beats! is a bizarre and enigmatic anime, filled with paradoxes. It always tries hard, and (ironically) has its heart in the right place.\r\nAngel Beats! is set in apost-death purgatory and the romance (and also to a fair extent, the drama) are very much suppressed. Comedy and mystery are the order of the day. The SSS regularly find themselves having to \u201csacrifice\u201d members to navigate booby traps or sabotage exams which result in ridiculous over-the-top death scenes and physical comedy which is kept fresh by little unexpected twists each time.\\n\\n\r\nThe mystery, on the other hand, is a mess. Many of the plot-driven conflicts end up being little more than meaningless diversions, created by misunderstanding and there\u2019s only two cases where characters act even remotely sinister, the first of which results in repentance and a reversal and the second of which is a plot device. \\n\\n\r\nAfter Otonashi\u2019s realization about two-thirds of the way through, I thought an emphasis on the characters was going to be the order of the day for the rest of the series, but that wasn\u2019t to be, seeing as how Angel Beats! evidently can\u2019t hold the same tone for more than an episode. \\n\\n\r\nI adored the ending. The final episode almost seemed detached from the rest of the show with the characters behaving vastly differently and a relaxed tempo in a story that otherwise acted strapped for time. But the finale it was so romantic and overflowing with genuine emotion thanks to a good plot twist.",

The Characters in Angel Beats all had troubles and aspect of their life that was horrible and each one used to express the viewers to relate the Character, well I really cried and start liking them, while its much harder to relate them all.\r\nStory 9/10\r\nAngel Beats is all about the people who are trapped in the afterlife or purgatory because they cannot find peace in their lives to moveon. They live in a school where they can make anything with dirt or alter. The Protagonist Yuzuro Otonashi wakes up in this world in a middle of fire fight and meets the leader of SSS and later on killed where he learns that he can never die. The story is all about Otnashi trying to remeber his lost memories and helps other people to move on like the way he help Yui.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe Character designs were all very well done and stunning visuals and different kind of hair colors and rather unique.The Animation is amazing and beyond what we come to expect and lightning effects give how slightly see.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nOne of the main reason why I like this anime. The theme song makes very emotional even though they are actually more contradictory and the ending usually feels. The Character also shows actually have a band name GirlsDeMonster\\n\r\nthe players are very fantastic on their on instrument and getting more attention of the NPC. Angel Beats is on another level of music production. The voice acting is really good in my own opinion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nThe main reasons and the strongest point of the series to grow. The Characters are sort of in pain of their lost in their living days, as if you are going to relate to them, they don't express nearly as much feeling as they going to relate the other character in the series. Especially Yui she was really a perfect representation of what its like to be able to move like a normal person after being unable to even walk after several years since she is 4 years old. All what she saw in the TV was actually granted and performed by Otonashi and Hinata. The experiences of the Character was actually painful.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI love the series it makes me cry the story is very unique and drew me to kept me wanting more until the end of the series.\\n\r\nBut the ending of the first season make me want to have season.I definitely had a good time watching this Anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nGreat anime especially the backstory and sounds the only problem is to be have more episode. I highly recommend this anime for those who like drama and those who wants to cry watching this\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "As my first anime review (wish me luck), I chose to review an all time favorite, Angel Beats!  I will admit it has many noticeable flaws (to people who give it a 5,6, and 7), and isn't perfect, but it doesn't need to be. The way the story, characters, art, and sound fit together is like no other anime. Some scenes will have you cracking up. Some will have you watching silently as your eyes well up will tears. Angel Beats is something beautiful that is truly an experience to watch, and something I believe everyone should.\r\nStory 9/10\r\nThe story the anime includes is amazing,but feels incomplete . At the end, there is much unexplained. The story is at it's peak when characters' past and life is explained, but does not get a chance to explain to explain each character's. The lives people lead out make you question what you are doing with your life, and what it means to be alive. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was completely gorgeous. Everything from the opening to the battle scenes to the concerts was impeccably animated. The character designs were really unique and likable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 11/10\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I know I can't give an 11 out of 10. But the music and OST is just amazing. Background music was well suited for whatever was going on. Songs like Crow Song, Alchemy, Shine Days, and My Song make the music memorable and make the show even more enjoyable. The opening is a great way to start the anime and one of my favorites. With Kanade playing the piano, and flashing scenes of what will happen later in the episode, the art in it is memorable also. All kinds of music are included. Ichiban no Takaramono and Brave Song are beautiful, sad songs, while Crow Song and Alchemy are catchy and lovable.  \\n\r\n   The voice acting was great in the dub, I think better than the original for Otanashi and Yuri, and also good in the sub. I did like Kanade better in the sub, her voice sounded a little too robotic in the dub. But if you're planning to watch, go with either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI know that I lot of people say the characters follow typical stereotypes. I truly think each character was different in likable in their own way. TK was hilarious, despite not talking much, Yuri was strong and tough (though a like psychotic at times), Yui was lovable and outgoing, and Ooyama was totally average but still was likable and had good lines. The rest of the characters all had something to like about them too. The characters teach people to try and work hard to achieve your goals, and to make your life worth something, to not giving up. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nI love this anime so much. It really touched my heart, and I do believe you're missing out if you don't watch it. It's not for everyone. It's not for the critics or the eye rollers or the people who only watch for fan service. And thats fine. If you don't like it after the first few episodes, thats okay. I'm not forcing you to watch it. (how would I?) But despite people saying there is nothing special about it, I believe there isn't an anime out there quite as special as angel beats. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10",

            "content": "Angel Beats...laughter...tears...really Clannad-ish in the good way...\r\n~Story~  8/10\r\n    The story was really intresting as it makes you think what would you do if you realized that you was dead...would you accept it...deny it...feel lost...that's a good question!\r\n    Angel Beats also has great development of both the story and the characters. All the questions you and the character have will be answered when they are supposed to and the way that charaters act is different (Not out of character,just more mature.) as the show progresses \r\n    However the best thing in the story is the backstoryof each character. The backstory helps the viewer undestand the reason behind every action of the character. Unfortunately there are a lot of characters left with no backstory...but hey nothing is perfect right?  \\n\\n\r\n~Art~  9/10\\n\r\n    The animation is stunning! Every character is well designed, the fight scenes are really well done , the colours and everything is just...WOW!\\n\\n\r\n ~Sound~  10/10\\n\r\n    Again... WOW! To be honest, if GirlsDeMo were a real ife band I would definately be a fan. The songs were wonderful,  I even like listening to them even after watching the show and the singing was very emotional (for example My Song or Ichiban no Takaramono that makes me cry every time I listen to it!).\\n\\n\r\n~Charcters~  9/10\\n\r\n     There are some shows that even though the story is great, the character are just so annoying that you do not enjoy the whole show at all. Angel Beats is faaaar from that category! All the characters  all likeable and you can relate to them at some extend. The development of the character is also great as the series progresses. \\n\r\n    The thing is that it is okay if you are crying because I think that's the magic in the show. Feeling the characters...understand them...try to imagine youreself in their position. \\n\r\n    And as I metioned before the backstories are a great thing in Angel Beats. However I got a little annoyed that some of the character had no development or backstory at all (like Shiina which I totally loved and the other GirlDeMo members). That's the only reason why I rated Characters 9/10. \\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~  8/10\\n\r\n   Well I have to admit that this kind of anime is not my kind of tea. Don't thing of it as 2 point before 10. Instead thing of it as 8 points after 0! I just hate being in the emotional state these anime bring me in and I hate crying! However I really enjoyed this anime in whole! \\n\\n\r\n~Overall~  9/10 \\n\r\n    Angel Beats is a great anime! You will totally like it if you like Clannad and if you can easily relate to the characters. You will like it too if you like badass girl characters (Yurippe!!) and great fight scenes without tons of blood! I would highly reccoment to watch it!!!\\n\\n\r\n*Thank you sooo much for reading my review ^^ I apologise for any mistakes (English is not my mother tongue) Watch Angel Beats!!*",

            "content": "Well\u2026 In general terms I'm giving an excellent rate to this anime because it was the first anime that really made me reflect about my live.\r\nFor me it's a masterpiece, it's an anime that you have to see at least one time in your life.\r\nThe philosophic questions this anime made me had was:\r\n* What happened to us after dying?\r\n* Is dying so painful as we thing?\r\n* Is the christian religion the truth?\r\n* Does the heaven exist? (If it exists, it doesn't respect the laws of the physic, because the heaven stores a lot of energy that is circulating with the reincarnation).\r\n* Will I reincarnate?\r\n* AmI happy with my current live?\\n\r\n* Am I doing what I want to do to be happy?\\n\r\n* What is my purpose in this live?\\n\r\n* Should I let my organs to be donated after I die?\\n\\n\r\nThe story made me reflectionate about that because [a little SPOILER ALERT] the story is about some students that die before make their purpose in life, or that die unhappy.\\n\r\nThese students are afraid of a \u5929\u4f7f (angel) called Kanade that wants them to follow the rules of the limbo's school, but they resist because they think following the rules would make them reincarnate, and most of them don't want to reincarnate because they wanna avoid the painful of the life.\\n\r\nWell\u2026 one boy (whose name I don't remember) starts to help them to do whatever they wanted to do in life, and that made them to reincarnate\u2026 bla bla bla\u2026 a lot of story\u2026 etc\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline was very good. It maintained you in the story.\\n\r\nThe music I loved it. The opening \u300eMy soul, your beats!\u300fis one of my favorite song now.\\n\r\nTachibana Kanade was my waifu.

            "content": "In the beginning, Angel Beats was only a time-filler for me when waiting for download process of another popular series (for some reasons, Angel Beats has smaller file size than the other anime I supposed to watch, therefore it is much faster to download). But as I watch every episode of Angel Beats, I found something beyond my expectations for this anime.\r\nAngel Beats managed to impress me with its own sense of comfort.\r\nFirstly, somehow the whole concept of the anime seems like an RPG (Role Playing Game). It is set in a purgatory afterlife world, which resembles a boarding school. Except for our main characters,the students are described as NPC (Non-Playable Characters) which looks like normal students, but in reality they're just AIs (Artificial Intelligence) set to make the entire school looks normal from the outside. In the world, anyone can't die and will recover from any mortal wounds. Anyone could make any item with dirt as long as they remember the form from their past lives. Besides the concept, the music and interface also feels like RPG. It really puts our mind into the world of fantasy, while still maintaining its reality aspects through its characters.\\n\\n\r\nFor some reasons, I can't really describe the storyline here. First, as you watch the first episode you will come to understand the whole concept easily. Second, the concept itself would be the main highlight to the entire series. If I describe the storyline now, I would either be forced to lie to the readers or spoil the \"truth\" behind the world.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the plot, in the beginning it was very playful and can't be taken very seriously (with jokes here and there). The beginning of the series is only a mere introductory though, with the later episodes becoming more and more rich in plot and intensity.\\n\r\nThe last 4 episodes were especially inspirational. In the beginning I thought that episode 7 reveals most of the secrets, but then the series revealed more and more secrets to the point of unexpected turns of events. I was also surprised to the fact that the story and plot got so much deeper than it was in the beginning. It changed my total concept of Angel Beats. This anime is not as shallow as I thought it to be, instead the events are truly unpredictable. It concludes to one hell of an amazing ending which unfolds the final mystery of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nFrom character aspects, In the beginning you will be confused with that many supporting characters. Some reviews mentioned the lack of originality of its characters, but from my point of view nowadays its very, very hard to create a totally original (but normal) character, unless he/she is designed to be very weird, eccentric or totally nuts (TK, one of the characters is very, very original because of those reasons. Take an example from characters of One Piece too, they're very original because they have their own weirdness and abnormalities). \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I agree that some type of characters in Angel Beats lacks originality, that aspect is what made me feels like knowing them even before they had much dialogue in the series. Despite that, some characters managed to be original, not because of their personalities or looks, but from their story on their own past lives. As the series goes on, some of the characters will tell stories about their life before they died (which is usually very tragic or sad).\\n\\n\r\nWell, in my opinion, the series should have been longer. With current ideas and many characters available, it should be no problem to make Angel Beats into a 20 or even 26-episode anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to point out the minus side of this anime, I would criticize the length and development. It is kind of waste to see the concept (uncommon kind of purgatory and rules of it) developed only into a 13 episode anime. Supporting characters also lack personalities development compared to the main characters. The disappearance of characters lacks elegant animation, and the closing (final scene of ending) is a little bit too focused on main characters to the point that we as viewers yearns for more explanation on what happens to the whole SSS crews after the ending and how are they doing.\\n\\n\r\nAbout Sound, there are many songs from the school band featured in the anime named \"Girls Dead Monster\", but I still enjoy the opening and ending songs (the opening song remix in episode 4 was especially epic). The animation quality is also very, very dynamic and enjoyable (not too soft, but still bright and beautiful). We could see that the animation staff didn't slack off at all. Those who always skip the opening song wouldn't notice, but as the story progresses (with the appearance of new characters and disappearance of the old ones) the opening and ending song animations would change according to the current casts available.\\n\\n\r\nWatch Angel Beats. It is especially ideal for avid RPG gamers who also likes to watch anime with some romance qualities in it, but doesn't mean that it is not suitable to the others. For me, it was such a pleasant anime experience. Try it.",

It causes me to have a flat face, small mouth for butchered pronunciation, restricting hands, and gradual loss of hearing. I play violin and i am currently ranked in the top 5 best for my age group in the state, but i am lagging behind due to my hand condition. I was depressed for months. That's until an anime called angel beats changed my life.\r\nNow after watching i've gained the strength that otanashi had when he wanted to become a doctor. I aspire to studygenetics and to prevent this from happening to as many people as possible. I still get depressed from time to time but i can now move forward thanks to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nANYWAYS........\\n\\n\r\nStory: this anime had a great setting and plot. The end has a nice little twist and you'll be on the verge of tears at the end. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: Key has once again wowed me with their beautiful art and animation. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: First of all, Lia has again transported me to my happy place with a achingly beautiful opening \"my soul, your beats\" is among my favorite songs of all time.

            "content": "Angel Beats! is one of those animes where it looks terrible at first but in the end blows everyone away and sends them on feels trips. It's definitely an anime where judging by the cover is wrong.\r\nStory: \r\nThe story line really confused me at first. One, because I had no idea where we were and what the objective was. I was at a loss. They literally place you in a suspenseful situation with one of the characters and put you right into the action. Different enough, but too confusing. I can see why this storyline is considered overrated and adds arguments and controversy online, thecharacter style is the first thing people see, then there's character bands and they just press the stop button right after because it's too silly, yet this story was touching. It brought a comfort but thrilling feelings. There were unexpected things and things that were too unexpected. In short, this story showed exceptional potential at first sight and didn't disappoint. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI've never seen such amazing background before. The sunlight/rays casting onto the scenery really showed the mood through it. It brought the sad atmosphere through the character's emotions and played it to us in return. Absolutely breathtaking. \\n\\n\r\nBut the characters...not so much. I think they could've done without the colourful hair and big eyes. The high schoolers were cliche enough, but using an anime style that has turned anime into a bit...strange was too much. It's a reason why people stop watching, they think oh bright haired characters equals horrible story line. The character's style pulls the actual plot away. It's quite a disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe music was perfect. Just like I said about in the background art, it added atmosphere to the emotion of the story. The into song really set the pace of the story, upbeat, but also very tragic. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\\n\r\nHow do you get rid of a cliche character? Give them a gun or a sword and you're problem is solved!\\n\\n\r\nWrong!\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, the style of the characters were disappointing, but the characters themselves weren't too bad. There was character development thankfully. I think the characters being high school students did add the cliche element to it so I think they could've used more creativity, but Kanade especially was very interesting, but we needed more backstory on them. There were characters we didn't know enough of. It was too rushed. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: \\n\\n\r\nThe anime was rushed. The episodes were extended by a few minutes, but I felt like there should've been at least 30 episodes for it to be complete. We have no idea what happens in the end. Otonashi is left hanging then appears in the world of the living again. But this still put me on a bus to Feelsville. It really did give me that \"awe\" moment, but didn't give me the feeling of wanting to watch it over and over again. \\n\\n\r\nI give this anime 54% on the angel scale. \\n",

It's one of the top end series with everything kept at the highest level.\r\nIn this certain series you will face laughter, tears and uplifts every now and then. It's a story that will make you think about life, you will ask yourself \"Hey, why am I complaining so much?\" \"Hey, my life is kinda great what am I thinking now?\"\r\nBecause it's a story about life. About lives that had to be redeemed. That had to be lived again, just because they simply needed that.\r\nWhatwould you do if you had a chance to live your life again unbound? Without any barriers? Without any limitations?\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\nSTORYLINE:\\n\r\nThe storyline is based around a group of young people, for some reason they are trapped in a different world, not knowing what is exactly going on.\\n\r\nAnd that drives you in from the very beggining. You simply just want to know what is exactly going on!\\n\r\nAnd then, slowly, you learn about who they are and what they want. Why are there here.\\n\r\nAnd those are the best parts, because those character are written with a thought. They are people, they managed to make them like real people. You will be able to sympatize with them easily, which is the best part of the show.\\n\r\nAnd that is why, you will laugh and cry. Because you will be able to understand them, to comprehend what they were after while doing certain things.\\n\r\nAnd you will be able to comprehend why is that they are here, together.\\n\\n\r\nVIBE:\\n\r\nIt's warm, the vibe is just warm. And while being warm, it can also be cold and dark, to be honest. Mostly you will have a laugh, or at least a smile.\\n\r\nThose jokes there are just silly, but they are silly for a purpose. You can figure this one out while watching the series :)\\n\r\nAnd when it's cold, it will freeze you. You will burst out in tears. I myself burst out in tears while watching on ceartain scene, with Yui and Hinata, you will get what Im talking about. You surely will.\\n\r\nAnd that is epic, this series manages to initiate emotions that are exactly opposite to each other. After crying a bunch, you will smile a lot. Right after the scene, you will be happy, even though you cried. And that is what I call a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nART STYLE:\\n\r\nAs you can probably notice, its radiant. The colors are bright and happy. Some people might use a little bit of tweaking here and there. But overall I like it. The best thing is that every character is drew with a certain taste, so that they all look different, which is especially nice. I like when characters can be differentiated by just plain symbols.\\n\r\nAnimation is great, all the fight and the places theyve been at are pretty. They didnt use any shortcuts while drawing, nothing in distance is blurry or undone.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/VOICEACTING:\\n\r\nOhhhhh, music. I listen to the SONG, yes SONGS, from the series till now. And I watched it a buuuuuunch ago.\\n\r\nThere's this band called Girl Dead Monster that was established in the series, making songs and singing them in the series. They also made some bonus songs outside of the series. And I love those, the girls that are singing (there's two of them) have wonderful voices. It makes me remind myself of what happened in the series. And well, the whole music part takes a big role in the anime. It's pretty damn important.\\n\r\nVoice acting is nice. They managed to give every character a recognizable voice, so that they are more original. Some of them even use a special manner of talking! Which is always very funny! \\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\r\nIm gonna repeat myself with what I said in the very beginning. I recommend it to everybody, even those that havent watched any anime in their lifes. This is a good starter.\\n\r\nThis anime will be in my mind forever. Whenever I have a bad day I think about those people from Angel Beats. I feel better in a blink of an eye!\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Widely regarded as one of the saddest anime to have come out over the past few years, it is little surprise that Angel Beats has garnered such an enormous fanbase, many of them calling the series a masterpiece. The truth is, however, that Angel Beats, while emotionally taxing at times, isn't without its serious flaws that keep from being regarded as highly as other emotional rollercoasters like Anohana. \r\n---- MILD SPOILERS AHEAD ----\r\nTo begin with, the premise of Angel Beats is actually quite simple: a high school in the after life where people with past regrets go to. Basically a purgatory with a high schooland various \"filler\" NPCs that populate the school along with the main cast. However, this seemingly straight forward premise takes almost 3 episodes of the 13 episode series to really start making sense, which detracts mightily from the story. The presentation could have been done better for sure, and even by the end I was left with a couple of questions unanswered despite the Band-Aid method of explaining some of the events surrounding this \"purgatory\" at the end. \\n\\n\r\nOnce it picks up, however, it really does drag you in, despite the holes, and I was quite surprised at how immersed I found myself in the world. Bonus points for originality, taking the typical high school setting and giving it a unique twist. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the OP and ED I didn't find the OST of Angel Beats to be particularly memorable, with the exception of one song played towards the end of the series. It was good, but nothing to write home about. \\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to my next point: art. The animation is crisp, and the character designs are done well enough, but I didn't find anything else to be particularly well done. Once again, good but nothing too great. \\n\\n\r\nNow, here comes my biggest gripe with the series: the characters. In short, there are entirely too many character to give a sh*t about. By the end of the series I knew, maybe, half of the cast and even that is being generous. Outside of the main 3~4 characters in the show, the rest of the cast is entirely forgettable and bland. Even most of the longer shows have no more than maybe 5 main characters, but Angel Beats bit off a lot more than it could chew in this department. 13 episodes is simply not enough time to fully develop 10+ characters  for the audience to connect with. A couple more also get arbitrarily thrown in, which further adds to the already chaotic attempt at trying to develop everyone. \\n\\n\r\nConversely, the characters that you DO end up giving two hoots about were very well done. They all have absolutely soul-crushing moments that truly reflect the type of atmosphere this show was trying to achieve. Truly, heart-wrenching moments which is what drew so many people in, in the first place. \\n\r\nHowever, these moments are unfortunately swamped by several \"feels-baiting\" moments as well which detracts from the atmosphere the genuine moments created. This show tries too hard to be sad at times. \\n\\n\r\nYet, despite all my gripes I had I still enjoyed the show. Seeing Otonashi come to terms with who is was quite the story to watch, and the latter half of the show really does pick up in the quality department. Even if 80% of the cast is irrelevant, the main cast ends up being engaging enough and seeing all of them come to terms with who they are was satisfying. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Although I watched alot of animes until now I decided to write my first review for Angel Beats! because I've seen alot of split reviews/opinions regarding this anime which actually dosen't fall in none of those good/bad extremes.\r\nThat being said I will try to keep my review objective, concise and as much as possible spoiler free.\r\nOk, let's begin:\r\nStory: 7/10 Why? Beacuse actually it's a mess overall. The creators never had a clear vision on this one. They tried to tackle multiple genres like action, fantasy, comedy and drama in such a short runtime and failed on most of them. I think alot of screen timeis wasted on this so called war between SSS and Tenshi/Kanade, time which would had been better spend on chararacters backgrounds and flashbacks.\\n\r\nI think the story would had been better overall, if they focused more on the afterlife subject, to be more specific, on how everyone got there, what keeps them there and why they can't move on. Essentially, character development, a word I'll keep repeating in this review.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 I can't really complain in this section. Beautiful art, visuals, characters designs and a color palette that's nicely used to set the mood for this purgatory-type world (which is actually a high-school, you guessed). The animation is solid and consistent through the show but I have a minor complaint about some sloppy mouth animations in a few scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 Beautiful OP/ED songs that fits nicely with the anime theme. BGMs are not that outstanding but they do the job they're meant to do which is to set the scene mood. I also loved the last song played by Iwasawa (If you haven't watched the series, you will know which one I'm talking about when you get there).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10 Big problems here. Too many characters, too short of a series. The only result you will get is poorly developed characters. From the whole bunch of characters Angel Beats has, only three of them get near-good character development. I'm talking about Otonashi, Yuri and Yui and sadly the last one is not even a main character. Any others characters feel almost flat with little to no character development at all. They are given some different personalities and skills but it's useless without some background stories on who they were and how they got there. Even Kanade who is a main character and one of the most important in the series feels like she's only there for the ride. We don't really find out her story until the last episode of the series (actually just a fragment of it) by the time it's too late. Her character as a whole and her relation with Otonashi desperately needed more screen time, especially to add more depth to the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10 Not bad pe se. It kept me entrained, interested and curious. It didn't feel like a waste of time and some episodes that focused on character development and background story were really good. I'd hoped for a more developed love story, so I was rather disappointed in that area.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall, it'a an enjoyable anime that shines in art/sound departament but lacks some key elements in the story and characters departament. \\n\r\nFinally conclusion:\\n\r\n  I think Angel Beats tried to pull a Clannad AS move on us, which, maybe had a chance to succed with proper character development and a 24 episodes season. It's a shame it didn't.\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n\\n",

If you're anything like me, your heart WILL be touched.\r\nIf this anime was a person living in New York City, everyone would know about them. Why? Because everyone who sees them would experience powerful surges of emotion and would more likely than not burst into tears. This anime does a spectacular job at invoking emotions deep within the human soul.\r\nIt's not necessarily a sad anime. In fact, by the end, it seems as if all the characters will wind up happy. Butit still left a bittersweet feeling in my chest.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're just looking for a casual show to watch without getting invested in the characters' back-stories, futures, and current situations, avoid this anime. This anime was the second to successfully move me to tears, and even then, the first one only did it once. Angel Beats! had me in a state of emotional stimulation throughout almost the entire series, as well as a few days after I finished.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also has a really good soundtrack, which is something I rarely pay attention to in any anime. For this one, though, there were not only great songs, but the music actually played a part in the plot. What's that? You want to know how they integrated music into the story? Ah ah ah, no spoilers. You'll have to watch it for that. ;-)\\n\\n\r\nIf I haven't piqued your curiosity enough already, I'll let you in on something: the title, Angel Beats!, has multiple meanings. Happy watching!",

            "content": "Angel Beats : Welcome to the Afterlife War Front\r\nSynopsis:\r\nAfter waking up, Yuzuru Otonashi finds himself with amnesia and a girl with a gun telling him he\u2019s died and is in the afterlife. He is asked to join the Afterlife War Front and fight against a being trying to destroy them know as Angel ,which of course looks like a normal high school girl. Doubting this crazy girl he decides to speak with the  Angel and is greeted with a blade stabbing him through the heart. Again he wakes up with no stab wound and no idea what\u2019s going. Otonashi finally realizes that the girlwith the gun might not be as crazy as she seems and decides to figure out what is going on in this afterlife world and regain his missing memories. \\n\\n\r\nReview: \\n\r\nAngel Beats is just one of those animes. One of those animes where my heart want\u2019s to like it and get all emotional about life and death, but my mind is going what\u2019s the point? With a story focusing on the afterlife and the nature of god this anime sadly turns into a drama between high school students and finding love. Maybe this is my own expectations of  Angel Beats going in but the feeling i'm left with after completing this series is a mix of sadness and wanting more. \\n\\n\r\nGoing into Angel Beats i already had my own expectations. I was expecting this epic about life, death and god and what i got was part way between that and a romance drama. Normally this wouldn\u2019t have bothered me but Angel Beats just had so much potential starting off. Every part of the story just begged for a deeper experience. Students at this school are all in limbo after not being able to experience their teenage years, everyone of them has severe trauma, and they are fighting against an Angel to defy God for giving them such horrible lives. Perfect setup for a Death Note/ Psycho Pass like anime right? WRONG! At the end of the day everything boils down to love and forgiveness which is all well and good but where did the other stuff go?\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats has a lot going for it in other departments though. The animation looks beautiful with colors just jumping off the screen, characters are all unique (with those big ol puppy dog anime eyes) and every location and background make a lasting impression.  In terms of animation Angel Beats can hold up to probably some of the best in the business. \\n\\n\r\nAnother strong point for Angel Beats is its music. Im not just speaking about the opening and ending themes (which by the way are some of the best) but more the actual music in the Angel Beats world. When they Afterlife War Front needs a distraction they call in their own afterlife band Girls Dead Monster. They rock! Everytime the band plays it\u2019s like watching your anime with a rock concert playing in the back ground. Trust me that\u2019s something that you want. Every song is catchy and memorable even getting me to sing along at points. The animation even takes a bump up during these sequences so you get to watch your awesome rock show with even better animation. It\u2019s a win win. \\n\\n\r\nThe last thing i want to mention that really impacts my feeling on the show is it\u2019s length. Angel Beats goes for 13 episodes and it does pretty well but if it just would have added maybe 5-10 more episodes you would be reading probably a much more positive review. There are so many characters in the Afterlife War Front group that are just not talked about. We get to hear the stories of the main characters with some side characters but a majority of the team is just straight skipped. The shortness of the show impacts it\u2019s ending quite heavily as well. Everything feels like a sprint to the finish line near the end. All it would have taken is a couple more episodes of explanations, reveals, and character information to make the ending feel stronger and leave a more lasting impact. \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nAfter reading this review i hope you don\u2019t think i hate Angel Beats. In actuality that\u2019s far from the truth ,but it\u2019s hard to not see the potential this show had to be even better.  With a solid setup, amazing animation and music that now dominates my Iphone all Angel Beats really needed to be a stronger anime was time. Expectations aside if this afterlife romance drama would have explained its world, characters and backstory just a little further it would no doubt be one of the most brilliant stories told in anime. \\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats: 7/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nCheck out  Angel Beats on Crunchyroll",

            "content": "\u201cEveryone will be alone someday, living on in memories only. Even so, it's fine. I call this peaceful feeling my friend.\u201d\r\nSuch a beautiful anime. If there was an anime for you to not skip OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s (especially not ED\u2019s) this would be it.\r\nStory: 8\r\nIt was only 13 episodes T.T but the story still fit in perfectly. The first arc would probably be meeting all the characters and developing them whilst the second half has them working together to defeat the \u201cantagonist\u201d. The story had a very nice setting and there were some nice twists near the ending. At no point did I find theshow boring at all, story wise this was written very well. If you\u2019re looking for a comedy/feels anime this one balances it so well. You know how some animes/games have terrible balance of emotions? One example is Bioshock infinite where Elizebeth just screams and is running from you for slaughtering people. After 5 seconds of screaming you ask her to pick a lock and she\u2019s like THIS WILL BE EAAASSYYY. Angel beats knows when to be sad and when to make you laugh.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe lighting is something that I kept noticing in this anime, (though a lot of current animes are now learning of the power of lighting) but everything is beautiful. In the afterlife and in flashbacks of real life everything looks so pretty. The colors of uniforms and everything were made to appeal to the eyes. Just watch the OP if you\u2019re unsure, that\u2019s basically the art for Angel Beats.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nVoice actors are all amazing. A bunch of A-list voice actors like Sawashiro, Kamiya, and Hanazawa. The voice actors fit the roles so well, like the character models vs. the voices fit perfectly. The other important part of the sound category is the music. My god the music. The opening, the Ending song? The songs sung by the band? (There\u2019s a band in the anime and they actually have the VA\u2019s sing a bunch of songs. Like A LOT of them you can find online.) They are so iconic and to be honest this anime probably has one of the best soundtracks out there. Super high point in Angel Beats.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe character development though (For the main ones at least). There are too many characters in the anime to give everyone\u2019s backstory but the ones that do get developed you get the feels. I can\u2019t get into much of this without spoiling this but one of my favorite scenes that hit close to me was when this kid who\u2019s always over shadowed by his older brother is climbing a tree, mind you the strict father always compliments the older brother for being better and his obvious superior. He climbs the tree and beats his brother and grabs a persimmon they were fighting for and falls off the tree. As the father walks away after witnessing this he says, \u201cIDIOT. It was just a persimmon.\\n\\n\r\n\u2026\\n\\n\r\nBut good job\u201d \u2013with a smile-\\n\r\nT.T OH GAWDDDD \\n\r\n(I definitely just spoiled it some part of something)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nNever felt bored during this anime. It was great. Short but sweet. Ending you might have heard was sad, it wasn\u2019t the saddest anime out there at all. But the thing about Angel Beats for me when describing it compared to Anohana or Steins Gate (Steins gate?!? Yeah) is that instead of the buildup of a dam and having it break in the end, the writers seem to have substituted that out for having a smaller dam but instead\u2026have pings. Pings? Every few episodes it feels as if something pokes at your heart a little and it\u2019s enough to make you feel tired and maybe miss a breath. Nothing that would generate tears but different touching moments that just make you think about life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this to someone who hasn\u2019t watched it? YES. Someone that has stuff to watch? I would prioritize this if you haven\u2019t watched it. It\u2019s not at the legendary stage yet but it\u2019s pretty damn popular and people know of how good it is. There are a some things you can nit pick at but in the end I loved it. I\u2019d like to thank this anime for, \u201cTruly and deeply, thank you for giving, my life to me.\u201d \\n\\n\r\n-Wink to people that have already watched it-\\n",

            "content": "As a work produced by Key and written by their foremost writer, Jun Maeda, I had a feeling this was a show I wouldn't want to miss.\r\nHowever, three episodes in, the show is still leaving me with mixed feelings - the production quality of the series as a whole is high overall, but the direction feels somewhat understated.\r\n===========\r\nStory:\r\nSo far, we haven't seen too much of the story, apart from the whole scenario being set in the afterlife and several of the characters' backstories. As a result, this area is one that is slightly harder to quantify. However, based on the series premise, previous experience withother Key productions and the general pacing, we might be getting some very powerful scenes in the latter half of the series - but that's just a few episodes away.\\n\\n\r\nIn a way, this show suffers from the same problems that AIR - a previous single-season adaptation of Key's work - did; there just isn't enough space for the story to expand in. The third episode, for example, was a half-hearted attempt at engaging the viewer in the story - it might have worked out for some, but it didn't hit the right chords with me. CLANNAD After Story is seen as a really powerful piece; it took almost four seasons to build up to that climax. Angel Beats! just doesn't have that kind of time.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Since this show is written direct for TV, the pacing might be a bit less hectic and the story less eclectic, but so far it's hampered by slightly spotty direction and a lack of screentime.\\n\\n\r\n===========\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Angel Beats! has been criticised several times, people noticing several frames where the quality is less than stellar. I've seen a few of these frames myself - the production team is, indeed, pulling off a few shortcuts here and there.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's to make up for the rest of the show. In the dramatic scenes - like the band scenes in the first and third episodes, and the battle in episode 2 - the quality of PA Works' animation really shines through. Creative angles, lights blooming in all the right spots, amazing frame quality where it really matters - and above all, a fluid and smooth rendition that makes the world they live in believable, whether they be walking through a school corridor or hunkering it down in an underground channel.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: The quality is variable - PA Works takes some shortcuts in the slower/faster scenes where things aren't focused on as much, but really amps up the production when things hit the climax point. Overall, a practice that makes the lulls that much more lull-like and the peaks that much more climactic, avoiding a 'Shinkai-esque' situation - to name the director - where sensory overload makes you unable to tell when the good stuff is coming and when the fluff is on.\\n\\n\r\n===========\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say here. The music is fine - \"Angel Beats!\"  by Lia, the OP of the show, is a pretty piece that stays for a while, but is still rather forgettable when compared with, for example, AIR's \"Tori no Uta\", CLANNAD's \"Chiisana te no Hira\" or even Little Busters!' theme song, aptly named \"Little Busters!\". The ED does its job, but it's forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nThe insert songs are when the show shines. The band's songs are used in conjunction with the SSS' exploits - and to great effect. The mix of sound of colour draws you in, really pulling you in and letting you watch the show as an experience, and not just a show.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes, though, excessive periods of silence or forgettable background music mars the experience, and detaches the viewer, making it feel like a chore to watch - but it never gets excessive.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Forgettable music that does its job, but with some highlights.\\n\\n\r\n===========\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe character design of the show is done by Na-Ga, Key's other character designer who did the designs for half of the cast from Little Busters!. Personally, I like Na-Ga's work as a whole, but the designs for Angel Beats! feel a little half-hearted, with the possible exception of TK who is awesome interpolated with awesome.\\n\\n\r\nYuri has been claimed endless times to be a \"Haruhi clone\", and while some may vehemently deny this as trolling, it is impossible to deny that many of her characteristics - apart from the obvious visual similarity - are similar to Haruhi. But I digress. Many of the female characters' personality traits stand out, but the males' traits tend to blend into each other after a while, and it's hard telling who's who - with the possible exception of Otonashi, him being the main character, and TK, for reasons stated above.\\n\\n\r\nAnother character, Christ, just introduced in episode 3, is almost entirely a one-dimensional stereotype. However, since we're not far enough along the show yet, it might yet be too early to say anything.\\n\\n\r\nTenshi stands out from the rest for being the sole antagonist so far - and her very dubious history and motives.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Standard character designs (no showstoppers) with mediocre personalities with several exceptions. Development might happen as we go along, but there doesn't seem enough time for all of them.\\n\\n\r\n===========\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nDon't let what I've said above get you down - the show's still hugely enjoyable. The gag timing is good, and the second episode is pretty darn funny in a semi-serious kind of way. There's also tons of room for the story to expand - it could go literally anywhere from here. With the great art, fitting sound and zealous adherence to the introduction-climax-conclusion triangle for each episode, the show doesn't leave out much.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n===========\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats! isn't a KyoAni production nor is it an adaptation of a visual novel with an entire team of creators backing it - and it shows. Jun Maeda does a great job as a single-man writing/music production team, but the development time isn't there, and it shows. The show suffers from a lack of proper screenplay development, being spotty in several areas, but it never draws back too much. And of course, there's the \"how-do-they-do-it\" production quality of Kyoto Animation as well - PA Works is a pretty darned good studio, but because of the nature of the work, it's invariably going to be compared with Kyoto Animation - and there's no competition there.\\n\\n\r\nA solid, way above average anime production in general - but less amazing in comparison to the other Key greats that KyoAni has produced in writing and in art.",

            "content": "Jun Maeda, who is in my opinion one of the greatest writers and composers, period, brings us yet another masterpiece. For some, Angel Beats was initially quite a skeptical topic, as his previous works are far more based on drama and conveying a powerful emotive message by the end of the story at hand. Angel Beats instantly comes across as not being his norm, which may worry some viewers. After seeing some images I myself was worried that it would be tweaked for a more mainstream audience. Luckily, this is not a problem at all.\r\nStory & Character\r\n Despite Angel Beats opening with a flashy startfull of high school students with guns, it can be compared to Maeda's past works such as Clannad on many, many levels all the way through the series. I like to think that Angel Beats is essentially the same as his past works  like Clannad or Air, however the  genres have been mixed up slightly.\\n\\n\r\nThe drama and romance elements of the franchise are toned down, but to make up for this the comedic elements are toned up and action is thrown into the mixture. This actually works remarkably well, and I don't think the balance could have been any better. Some of the comedy moments of this series really get you, and it never gets old. If you're watching Angel Beats because you enjoyed the past series from Jun Maeda, please don't read into me saying the drama has been toned down, because this is not to the degree you're thinking at all. It is true that the series, for the most part at least, is far more comedy and action based, however there is a lot of deep elements to the story and numerous powerful scenes which will bring you back to your past experiences of Maeda's legendary emotive writing.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with a more comic atmosphere as the characters are introduced and developed, keeping the story ongoing with beautiful action scenes. Over time, the comedy and action start to dye down and the more emotional elements come to fruitation. I'm not sure the story itself can be called original, because there are plenty of other stories with similar settings, however, the way in which Maeda approached this series definitely conveys a sense of originality which cannot be missed.  In short, despite the guns and the hilarious moments of the series, the deeper parts of this franchise are nothing less than beautiful. Yet another life altering experience from Jun Maeda.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters in Angel Beats are well done. The one issue people have is that some of the more minor  characters aren't really explored and remain a complete mystery. As nice as it would have been to see more of them, this didn't really bother me. The main characters are revealed more than enough, and even though there is still a lot of mystery, you still have a pretty powerful attachment to them by the end of the series. Kanade was by far my favourite character, if I had any critique of this series to offer it would be simply that I'd like to have seen more of her past memories. Other then that, the story and characters of this series are beautiful and flawless.\\n\\n\r\nArt / Animation\\n\\n\r\nAs you will expect if you have seen Air, Kanon or Clannad, the artwork of Angel Beats is nothing short of astonishing. The general quality of the artwork throughout this series is outstanding. I heard some people didn't like parts of it, but I still can't fault anything. The animation is just as amazing as it always has been, and the character designs are nothing less than beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nA particular highlight in this series are the action scenes, in particular those involving \"Angel\". The artwork in these scenes is always spectacular, keeping you on the edge of your seat. I can't find a single thing to say against the art in this series, as for the moment I think it'd come out as #1 in terms of artwork, of the anime series and movies I've seen. This show gets a no brainer 10/10 regarding its incredible art.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack / Voice\\n\\n\r\nJun Maeda is not only well known for writing masterpieces, but often for his involvement with the music of these series. Maeda brings us yet another outstanding soundtrack, of which I immediately got hold of after I finished watching the series. When it comes to the more generic, comedic background tracks the soundtrack really isn't anything new or outstanding. The main, more emotional songs however are absolutely amazing. The rule for this soundtrack is pretty much this. If the song has a piano in it, then it will be amazing! The soundtrack plays a massive part in the more emotional scenes of this series. Another great work of art. There isn't much else I can say about the main soundtrack, other than it is just amazing and touching in every way, nothing else needs to be said.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the main soundtrack, we have Girls Dead Monster, a fictional rock band featured throughout the series. These tracks are also great. Despite me not having a clue what the lyrics mean, they went straight on my iPod along with the main soundtrack. The episodes featuring Girls Dead Monster performences are always great, and really spice up the action scenes. The track \"Crow Song\" gives the series an explosive first episode which gets you instantly hooked. Yet another amazing addition to such a great series.\\n\\n\r\nI always watch the english dub version of anime series, mainly so I can appreciate the art more and also because it builds a more emotional attachment to the characters for me. Luckily the dubs for the works of Jun Maeda are always outstanding in this regard. Angel Beats features quite a few of the folks who worked on clannad, a cast I loved, and all of which did another great job with Angel Beats. I think the cast was chosen quite well, especially when it comes to the main group of characters. If you're one who prefers english dubs, you wont be disappointed with this one.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nOverall Angel Beats definitely checks into my top 5 anime series of all time, primarily for its characters and finale. The artwork and soundtrack for this series are truly outstanding, but I fully expected this prior to watching it. If you aren't going to watch this series, at the very least check the soundtrack out.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of the series is wonderful, it has some real original comedy, a great setting and pace, well developed characters, intense action scenes, moments which will make you reflect on life and a dramatic, sad, yet happy ending which everyone will love. For those interested in this particular topic, I actually had an unusual experience with the end of this series. Although it was indeed very powerful and touching, I didn't cry, which is strange considering I cried like a baby on several occasions through Clannad, and still do. I did however rewatch Angel Beats shortly after and on that second time through it did reduce me to tears with no effort at all. A truly perfect ending to an incredible story.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't gotten around to checking Angel Beats out, then get your butt in gear. This series is a must see for any anime fan! You won't be disappointed.",

            "content": "Alright, so I was in the mood to review something, so why not review something I dropped a while back. Angel Beats.\r\nLets go.\r\nStory: Angel Beats basically takes place in some high school for people that have \"died\", they need to learn to give up what they left off in their previous life to pass. In this afterlife, they can feel pain or injury, and they can die again and again but they awaken with no injuries, so basically something akin to limbo from Inception. The story follows some guy named Otonashi who loses his memories after death, he meets Lesbian (ha), a girl who inviteshim to join some guild called the Organization Battlefront, to fight against God itself for the fates that these guys suffered in there previous lives because apparently they suffered some horrible shit.\\n\\n\r\nHow in the hell is this a slice of life?\\n\\n\r\nTo go on, there is some four girl band in the guild that play music, and their enemy is some thing named Angel. The Battlefront fight against Angel.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, what?\\n\\n\r\nSo apparently this thing is supposed to be a feels fest which is probably why everyone is giving this a 8 or a 9 out of 10. All these characters suffer some sad backstory or something that makes them against God, but you are supposed to be spoonfed feels, basically every single person from the Strawhat Crew suffering some sort of tragic event as well. I absolutely despise this, at least Guts from Berserk actually goes through these in a sense that he doesn't give an absolute fuck and goes on. All these guys just cry and cry about how their lives were or was miserable (not like they do in One Piece, however, since they don't), by the way this anime is barely able to keep my attention so I have no idea if half the shit i'm saying is right or not.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't give a shit about the \"sad ending\" because I dropped this anime before I even reached that point and I read the rest online. All in all giving ratings because of feels is absolutely trash and despicable.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I can't call any of this slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nDefinitely one of the top parts about this but sadly didn't do enough to captivate me or save me from this trash.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAlso as good as art.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI don't give a fuck about anybody in this story. Screw Otonashi.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nBarely kept my attention.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3,5/10\\n\\n\r\nnot an average.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "'Angel Beats!' is Visual Art's first direct-to-anime attempt with original story. Set in an afterlife high school for lost souls, Otonashi Yuzuru wakes up with an amnesia, and recruited to \"Shinda Second Sensen\" (SSS), an unofficial student organization that opposes the \"Angel\" in order to remain in the post-death world.\r\nANIMATION: 8/10\r\nOverall animation quality is pretty high. Some of the scenes were actually breathtaking.\r\nWe're talking about Shinkai Makoto-level landscape by Studio Easter and best gun/knife fight sequences ever in anime.\r\nCG is nearly flawless, and character motions smooth with exception to one cut where characters were climbing down the ladder in episode 1.\r\nOn the other hand, there'sa lot of sloppiness in unimportant scenes. Some of the characters' faces are noticeably wider and off proportion at times.\\n\r\nCharacter design was very weak. Many characters had same faces with awkward hair gradients. It took me about 5 episodes to get used to it, compared to 2 at most for all previous KeyAni series.\\n\\n\r\nShould've stuck with Kyoto Animation.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10/10\\n\r\nVisual Art's BGM doesn't disappoint. Variety of high quality music that fits the scenes perfectly, and sets the pace. Memorable piano solo / orchestrated pieces for sad scenes.\\n\r\nAll-star seiyuu lineup, flawless voice acting with a lot of emotion.\\n\\n\r\nOP is an attempted reproduction of 'Kanon' OP, except the song is slightly weaker, and visuals lacking the mesmerizing flow.\\n\r\nEDs were amazing. Great song selections, and I'm not sure if the concept has been used before, but there were so many possibilities to it. After I noticed the change in episode 3, it made me wonder... Will it always represent the current team? Will they disappear one by one until Otonashi or Yuri is all alone? ...And will the finale ED be all previous members disappearing in chronological order?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY/CHARACTER: 5.5/10\\n\r\nThe setting was somewhere between 'Hanibane Renmei''s amnesia and co-existence (humans among NPCs vs Angels among humans), with school war dystopia of 'Toshokan Sensou'. Then you have the typical Key protagonist, and heroine was Haruhi without God's power, and a violent Nagato.\\n\\n\r\nStill, the resulting setting was pretty interesting and the story was executed very well until episode 11, with good balance of comedy and violence. I especially liked the two \"Descending to Guild\" episodes, both fine examples of Japanese comedy with repetitive and persistent slapstick self-sacrifices. Three students who vanished got a decent character development, each of them overcoming their past regrets in previous life and accepted their fate. SOS Brigade SSS went through various \"missions\" as Otonashi slowly find out what they were fighting for, and what they were fighting against.\\n\\n\r\nI actually found myself liking the two student council presidents. Tachibana Kanade gradually developed from a heartless and absolute destruction to a human being with a kind heart. Naoi Ayato played a huge role in the second half to provide dark humor by abusing his Geass hypnotic eyes, and the character had a distinct charm.\\n\\n\r\nThen the last two episodes happened.\\n\r\nA villain came out nowhere, and about 7 episodes' worth of material were skipped between episodes. Only 5 members remain for graduation... 9 characters disappeared before final episode and dismissed with \"they've gone ahead of us\". Yuri and Kanade's personalities COMPLETELY changed.\\n\\n\r\nThe mock graduation ceremony itself reminded me of the 'Clannad: AS' one, and dorama '1L no Namida'-like deliberate tearjerker effort with speeches in graduation ceremony.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDue to the 13-episode restraint, Noda, Matsushita, Fujimaki, and Shiina could've been combined to one person, and Yusa and TK did not need to exist to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nEnding was extremely rushed and predictable. I have to admit it was still a bit moving thanks to the amazing direction, and it allowed them to avoid 'Bokurano'-like episodic character background flashback trap.\\n\\n\r\nI also liked how this series depicted the human nature to struggle to stay alive, even after death.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7/10\\n\r\n'Angel Beats!' is a failed attempt to create the next 'Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu'. The series really needed 24 episodes so that all the characters can actually contribute to the story. As it stands, we only know the previous lives of 6 characters out of approximately 20. They left us hanging about what the whole school and the \"Angel Player\" software was about, and neglected the whole fighting against God argument.\\n\\n\r\nThe series was still highly enjoyable though, thanks to eye-candy artworks, awesome action sequences, and comedy. Director Kishi Seiji did a godly job of transforming this disastrous script and setting into a watchable series. The ED (also designed by Kishi) for the final episode was a masterpiece leading to the final scene.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it was another series that left me pondering: What a series it could've been with two seasons instead of just one.",

            "content": "Although I do not like to cast a vote only after the first episode, give a description of the movie by itself is not difficult. Usually to evaluate a movie if I do three fundamental aspects: Drawings, dubbing and history. Regarding the graphical result of the anime in general is quite good. Nothing surprising, but respects the canons of the series for current designs as well as for the animation. here we move on history, which is still rather confused but in broad terms the first episode introduces the setting. Unlike what may seem the poster and images we are in the afterlife. What appearsto the hero finds himself unconscious and without memory on a roadside, flanked by a strange girl (which may seem to eye his own age) of a huge army sniper rifle, and his name is Yuri. this is where the real story emerges. There is indeed a world in which it is impossible to die and where the real daily struggle for survival is to oppose the simple procedure that would lead to a poorly defined reincarnation. This is the purpose of \"Shinda Sekai sensen 'Association which is headed by Yuri own. Although it may seem obvious I think the story really original, because if you kill a hero today may seem almost a foregone conclusion, what you do not ever expect is that all the players in question have already started their adventure from the dead.\\n\r\nAs for the final vote, in my personal rankings tend to give 9 only masterpieces that just something missing. Based on this belief that an 8 will more than suffice for a series, graphically well-made, with a compelling story and a dubbing that seems to live up to expectations. We will see in the near future if we can expect even more.",

            "content": "Angel Beats seems to be one of the most popular anime series amongst newcomers in the world of anime. It was the same with me. Angel Beats was my very first \"real\" anime besides television shows such as Naruto or Yugioh. What does it have to offer? Let's take a look.\r\nLet's split up this review into the five categories as usual:\r\nStory (6/10):\r\nThe general premise seemed interesting. A boy without memories wakes up in an afterlife which is a high school alongside other classmates with real personalities and so called \"NPCs\". The story centers around our main protagonist but also on the events which happened tothe others in their normal life. It really tried to get us attached to the broad variety of characters but seemed to fail at the limited amount of episodes. 13 episodes are not enough to try to get us attached at a cast this big but it tried it's best to get certain people into the spotlight - but not all of them.\\n\\n\r\nThis could have been easily forgiven if it wasn't for the biggest plot hole of the show which was the ending itself. Sure it was tear-jerking and got to me but the way how they did it was not explained very well leaving questions if you dare to look behind the facade of onions being cut.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing which was handled very well in terms of the story was to show what people who had an unjust life could expect in their afterlife. Angel Beats was sad and handled the drama elements as well as the comedy ones.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and backgrounds in Angel Beats were nice to look at and solid in terms of quality. Lightning seemed done fine as well. Besides the quite unoriginal looking characters there is mostly nothing to complain about but also almost as good as nothing to praise a lot.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe Angel Beats soundtrack was downright gorgeous. From the opening theme to the ending theme as good as every musical piece was worth getting the soundtrack. I always listen to it when I'm in the mood. Jun Maeda did a great job in getting you involved in the happenings and Girls Dead Monsters \"My Song\" got my eyes wet. Very good!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue in Angel Beats for me was the immense amount of characters which were full of various archetypes you see in as good as every piece of fiction nowadays. We have the quite aggressively acting leader of the whole bunch, the shy beauty, the main characters \"bro\"-character and the mysterious foe just called \"Angel\".\\n\r\n The stereotypes aren't the major problem though. How only a handful of them got attention and their place in the spotlight was the letdown since the whole cast had something interesting to them, that is. It's a shame the creators only got time/budget to do 13 episodes. I'd love to see more in animation form.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nEven with its issues Angel Beats got me hooked for two days straight until I was finished. The comedy was alright, the action as well. It fulfilled most of the criteria to be an entertaining show. But the entertainment value is not to be confused with the actual quality of storytelling, characters and art-style. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict (6/10*):\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats was an entertaining, fine show but nothing more. Too much potential has been wasted by cutting the episode count to only 13 episodes which left as good as no time to focus on the interesting characters you suddenly had to feel for while watching them trying to achieve what they couldn't in their previous existence. Fans of drama should look into it - it has quite some emotional moments and is still good in terms of audiovisual quality.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n*) Score is not an average",

( wait for the after credit scene!) as touching as i found the story to be i found many plot holes that slightly bothered me, but not too much to the point were the show was ruined. \r\nart: \r\nthe art/animation for Angel Beats is about standard for its time. the quality ofthe intro does not necessarily match that of the series itself. even though the animation is average, the fight scenes were not as fluid as i would have liked, but over all very standard. \\n\r\nsound:\\n\r\nthe sound, the music in particular DRASTICALLY effects the environment and atmosphere of the situation so well i could almost feel it. over all the sound was amazing, but it lacked any one song in particular i would be willing to listen to without visual aid. \\n\r\ncharacter:\\n\r\ni find the characters is where this anime really fell short, i can't necessarily blame the writers though as this is a short series with a huge cast, physically not allowing them to properly develop the characters as well i would have liked.\\n\r\nluckily you get to see the two main characters back stories along with some of the supporting characters as well, but only for a small portion of it over the course of 1 or 2 episodes and then nothing else. there were some characters Angel Beats i was looking forward to seeing develop only to be disappointed by the end to realize they got none.\\n\r\nenjoyment:\\n\r\ni personally loved this anime, i found it truly beautiful to say the least. this anime is far from perfection but the overall mixture of every aspect of this anime allowed me to oversee its flaws and enjoy it for what it was. \\n\r\noverall:\\n\r\noverall i will be giving this anime a 9/10, as it truly touched me on a personal level as well as being a great watch. i highly recommend this anime to those of you who DON\"T get too easily attached to characters as you may cry.

            "content": "So Angel Beats!, pretty popular right ? But do you really know the story behind this anime ? As a fan of Key and Jun Maeda's work, I need to talk about them before talking about Angel Beats itself.\r\nHere we start with Key, a japanese compagny which makes very famous Visual Novel like Kanon, Air, Clannad, Litlle Busters... Yes all of these were Visual Novel in the first place and then adapted into animes. What's about Jun Maeda ? He is one of the founders, leading most of the projects, making the scripts and the music. This guy is awesome. But the thing is thatMaeda is tired of making scripts (he wrote most of Clannad story) and he wanted to concentrate on music. So he left for a short moment Key to make a personal project : Angel Beats!\\n\\n\r\nMy point here is to say : Maeda focused on music with this anime, and you feel it right ? Yeah the music is great but the story lacks several things and you can find it a little empty by moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe story can be a bit confusing as it start with the main character joining an already formed group : the SSS. There is a lot of people in this group, you can remember their name and most of them will be used for some gags without beging developed. So the first complain is the lack of character development. Same goes for the world in which the story takes place. But did it make me laught ? Hell Yeah ! Did it make me cry ? ...Yeah, on the feels scale : AnoHana < Angel Beats! < ... < Clannad AF (because there is nothing over Clannad AF). So it's not perfect but I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nQuickly the art : Na-Ga and Pa Works did a really nice job, the characters are nice, fight and Tenshi's powers are good too. I mean for an anime which not action oriented, it's great, no complain about this part.\\n\\n\r\nThen the music, because here, it's the real thing and ... well, Ichiban no Takaramono, nuff said. Okay actualy let's talk about Girls Dead Monster, the girl band that help the SSS. Jun Meada wrote every songs. You can say \"Annoying J-pop again?\", but honestly it worth give it a try (My song, Alchemy, Crow Song, Little Braver, Brave Song...). LiSA and marina did pretty well by interpreting the songs.\\n\\n\r\nNow, Jun Maeda is working on a mangas : Heaven's Door which tell the story bihind the SSS, how Yuripee create the group and why they are fighting. That's cool because all the characters have their background. Moreover, Key released a Visual Novel of Angel Beats! So the anime is just the begining...",

What Otonashi (the lead male) discovers is that this world is a place for young souls who can\u2019t move on from their former lives due to regrets, and yeah also his dead. \r\nOk story, the viewer sees things mostly from Otonashi point of view. Since he has amnesia this makes it very convenient, as Otonashi learns about the world around him so does the viewer and this sets a good pace.  Most of the show is very humorous and hadme laughing out loud. The concerts were amazing as well. But those elements are just sides to the main story which deals with the idea of what happens when we die?  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was excellent. There\u2019s a great range of songs in this anime brought to you by Dead Girl Monsters. But by far the best was the op by Lia which sets the tone for each episode and the visuals behind it are as good as the song. Also I loved the way the added songs to comedic moments, nice touch. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation, I can\u2019t fault it anywhere. The colours are amazing and scenes were very detailed. Animation has come a long way since I first started watching anime and this show is just the standard I expect.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters all have unique back stories, while we only get to explore a few of them they\u2019re all tragic. While they almost bring a tear to your eye, they also create so much depth to each character and it was a real shame that we didn\u2019t delve into everyone\u2019s past. I also enjoyed the hints of romance between a few of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy this show but I felt they could have done a bit more with it. A lot of characters were wasted but I\u2019m reviewing what they did do so I\u2019ll move on. The story had a few holes in it, if you took a minute to think about it. And l the last episode was dull until Otonashi and Kanades final conversation. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all it was a very enjoyable show, since I don\u2019t think too much I went with the ride. The way they mixed humour, music and afterlife makes a very well balanced and I would gladly recommend this show for someone to watch.  \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading and criticism is welcomed \\n",

But I personally \"liked\" the anime, without going over the top crazy for it. I first watched this anime because my friends raved about how Angel Beats was the saddest, most heart-breaking anime ever alongside AnoHana, and Clannad. Unfortunately for me I don't think I ever teared up while watching Angel Beats despite being a complete baby when watching sad stories; for example, I cried like a baby whilewatching AnoHana and Clannad: Afterstory. \\n\\n\r\nStory: Angel Beats is certainly an original story that I've never seen before and was really intrigued by. The story takes place in the afterlife world where people who have regrets about dying, roam around trying to discover and accomplish their regret/dream.\\n\r\nThe stories main character, Otonashi Yuzuru wakes up in a seemingly normal high school with no memory of anything, and little does he know that he's waken up in the middle of a weird war between a group of other students who claim that they're dead human beings stuck in this afterlife world, and a mysterious angel, Tachibane Kanade. So, what's Otanashi's identity and his regret in life? What about all these other students, who are they? Tachibane Kanade... An angel? What purpose does she serve? If the students and the angel are in the middle of a war, who is the \"good\"  and who is the \"bad\"?\\n\r\nSo overall, the plot seems interesting right? Well, it was good, but definitely not the best it could have been. It started off with so much potential, but then the story sort of drifted into all sorts of directions. The episodes really weren't really continuations from one another, they were hopping all over the place: something dangerous and stressful happens here, then it all disappears and the story introduces pure comedy, which then turns to romance, which then all disappears and goes back to the original afterlife achievement idea, then... you get the idea. Like, Angel Beats should have definitely stuck with it's original plot. The number of plot twists that happens was okay, but definitely could have been put to better use, the pacing just seemed a little bit off to me. Although I will say the end plot-twist really caught me off guard, and was probably the tragic climax that many will tear up because of. Anyways, all this criticism is because of how good Angel Beats could have been. This isn't to say that Angel Beats was bad, because Angel Beats has a highly enjoyable plot that I'd recommend everyone to check out. Personally, beginning ending was the bright spot in the anime for me and the middle was eh...\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was magnificent in Angel Beats, it's really hard for me to believe that it was created almost 5 years ago (heh, it's not even that long ago, but still) because the art is one of the most clear, colorful, and beautiful I've ever seen in a show. The portrayal of the characters and the overall background of that world (purgatory?) was neat. I really liked the art in the opening too, with the whole piano/wings/heart-beat rate design. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The best part of the anime. The opening was beautiful and it was delightful to listen to it everytime I started an episode. Not only was the opening good, but also the ending song was perfect! The voicing of each character was perfect! The soundtracks used in the anime were perfect! Furthermore, there wasn't just one or two memorable soundtracks, but the entire soundtrack of Angel Beats was beautiful. I loved Angel Beat's music beyond comprehension, especially \"Ichiban no Takaramono\" (*Cries*). The music certainly added more feelings to the entire anime.\\n\r\nLink to the song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tm7Xf9818FM (SO AMAZING!)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There were a lot of characters, and they were all likeable and enjoyable. To be honest, I wanted to give this part of the anime a 9 or 10, but I'll sort of be critical. The anime really threw a ton of characters out at the audience. I loved all the characters from the bottom of my heart (Especially Tachibana Kanade and Yui), but not all of them were developed (Only like 6-7 which is a lot, but there were just so many characters). If Angel Beats was more than a mere 13 episodes, then I'm sure that the story would have delved more into each character, but unfortunately that wasn't the case so due to lack of development, I was a bit disappointed. Way too many characters were introduced with potential and then thrown out of the window. Furthermore for the romance aspect of the anime in the story, the main character's love story didn't really make sense to me. It seemed as though one moment they were enemies, 2 episodes later, they're hanging out, out of the blue with no real development in relationship, and then suddenly they're in mutual true love. But once again, I'm being really critical. Overall, I actually liked the \"characters\" aspect of the anime because there was no character that I disliked, and all the characters were enjoyable. A lot of characters were really realistic and the viewers could definitely relate with them. It's just that I wanted some other interesting characters to get more screen time and development than they were given (Solution: Longer than 13 episodes). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyable: I won't deny that there were moments in the anime where I was left sort of sleepy, but overall I had fun watching the series. Certainly not as tear-jerking and great as some people make it out to be, but also not nearly as bad as some claim it to be. Angel Beats gets a solid \"8\" me, and is a show that I'd recommend to anyone, all ages. Angel Beats contains romance, drama, comedy, and action, and did a pretty good job keeping the entire series rather entertaining and likable.",

            "content": "Purgatory. The world in between. The waiting room of the afterlife. This anime is based in said world. To wake up in this world with no idea why you came here, and to be met by a girl in a school uniform with a sniper rifle who tells you \u201cyou\u2019re dead\u201d would sound alarms in your head. This situation is Otonashi Yuzuru\u2019s. After being confronted by Nakamura Yuri (The sniper rifle girl), Otonashi is left with a choice : Join the Afterlife Battlefront, or disappear. Neither of these choices sound too good do they? Not wanting to disappear for no reason, Otonashi chooses to fighta being labelled as \u201cAngel\u201d. And so the battle begins.\\n\\n\r\nNow that the quick synopsis is over, let\u2019s begin the review.\\n\\n\r\n~Story~\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats! story is very lacking in the beggining of the anime. Mostly in the first few episodes is a lot of comedy and humour, which is what Key normally would do with their anime. Later on though, Angel Beats! takes a sharp nosedive into the drama that any who watches Key\u2019s production knows and loves. Snapping from comedy to drama with a tinge of humour is a rather sharp turn. Though this snap occurs, it\u2019s easy enough to handle because storyline deepens and events start to take place. Throughout the rest of the anime, we are met with drama and sadness, Key\u2019s seemingly favorite thing. After battling shadow monsters and split personalities, we are met with the end. Like all Key animes, it leaves most of us in tears. The reason I cannot give you as it would absolutely spoil the ending.\\n\\n\r\nStoryline : 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~Art~\\n\\n\r\nNothing much to say about this other than absolutely fantastic. The flow of everything seems to be flawless, everything is easy on the eyes and when it comes to CGI, Key reigns on top. This anime is no exception.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development wasn\u2019t as strong as I\u2019d hoped it\u2019d be. Too many characters made me realize that a 13 episode series wouldn\u2019t be able to even cover HALF of the amount of characters I saw. Most characters were used as comedy than actual storyline. Only the 3-4 main protagonists had even a remote storyline. Unfortunately this anime failed to deliver a deep storyline for characters, and it saddens me to give it this rating.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~Music~\\n\\n\r\nOh my.. Oh my.. The music in the anime was absolutely phenomenal. It was used in the most appropriate of times and in the best way conceivably possible. Words cannot describe how such an awesome piece of work could trigger so many emotions. If this music was used to promote something, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to buy whatever it was.\\n\\n\r\nMusic : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nTotal score? 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWith the combination of art and music, Angel Beats! Was saved in my book. Absolute must watch. If you can get past the character development, then you are set for a GREAT anime. I won\u2019t hesitate to buy this when it comes out.",

            "content": "Anime fatigue \u2013 extreme tiredness resulting from mental exertion because of watching anime\r\nA lot of anime fans go through a period where they\u2019re in a rut. They watch anime out of obligation instead of pure enjoyment and escapism. Angel Beats! will always be near and dear to me because it was the show that got me out of my funk and reminded me of why I loved anime so much in the first place. \r\nIt had it an action packed story that managed to balance comedy with some fantastic heart wrenching drama, stellar voice acting, beautiful art and some of the most memorable characters I\u2019veseen in quite a while.  This is my review\\n\\n\r\nMINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW\\n\\n\r\nStory \\n\r\nThe story concerns a group of rebels (the Battle Front) who have all died and whose souls have moved on to the afterlife. All of them experienced hardship in life and they form the group to defy God.  Angel is the common enemy and she\u2019s there to make sure everyone stays in check and if you do what she says, your soul will move on (obliterated) (again). Things change when an amnesiac known as Otonashi shows up and joins the Battle Front. Angel Beats! had me in tears from the get go. Not from crying but from laughter, trying to be killed but never totally dying never stopped being funny. The first episode really catches you off guard with its light hearted nature because what follows will surely make the manliest of men shed a tear. The action is provided with the multiple encounters the Battle Front experience with Angel. It was intense, full stop. The story managed to be unpredictable (this is what pulled me into the world in the first place) and really mature.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nThere are too many characters to mention and some of them aren\u2019t in the spotlight too often but those who are, are well developed, layered, ordinary kids. Their past and back stories provide a lot of the drama. This is what made the kids feel so real, their problems of hardship and loss are experienced by a lot of us, which made them so relatable. I feel like Otonashi was my guide through this world as I could see what happens through his eyes, experiencing the incredible world and journey through him. From start to finish I was immersed because I felt like one of the members of the Battle Front.\\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\r\nI watched the dubbed version and it was fantastic. All the voice actors gave their character depth, never overacting and fit their anime counterparts perfectly. A special bonus to me was hearing Greg Ayres again who always manages to be entertaining, and Ayato was definitely entertaining. The OP was good, however I felt that the slow sad ED (\u201cBrave Song\u201d) fit the show better and the way the characters reappeared during the end credits was enough to give you a lump in your throat.\\n\\n\r\nArt \\n\r\nThe character designs were well done, even if there were times that their designs were greatly exaggerated for comedic purposes, their looks fit their personalities well and the backgrounds were also well drawn. The animation was smooth, crisp and clear. I was at a loss for words when the sun sets in the show. It was just beautiful how it fell on the characters and the backdrops. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \\n\r\nLike I said before, watching anime felt like a chore, but Angel Beats! changed all that. It was funny, sad, suspenseful, philosophical and thrilling. A lot has been said about the ending and even though it brought everything to a perfect close I have mixed feelings about it. It\u2019s up for interpretation. But it\u2019s about the journey not the destination right? \\n\\n\r\n Overall \\n\r\nWhat can I say? This is one of the most popular (and divisive) titles on MAL and with good reason and a lot of (better) reviews have been written about it. It\u2019s not for everyone but if I could just convince one person to see this show I\u2019d die a happy man. And when I die I hope to end up in the Distinguished Anti-Barnacle Extinction Battle Front.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "What really does happen when you die? That's a question plaguing man-kind for centuries. Is there a life after death? Do our physical bodies stay behind and our souls go somewhere else? What about if your past life was full of sin and bad choices? Is there a hell, or an in-between such as purgatory? Angel Beats! describes such a question and more: what if your past life was regretful? You then are stuck in a high school, living adolescence in a different setting with people like you. Interestingly Angel Beats! lets the viewer interpret what happens rather than giving you all the information, anddoes so in a rather funny way sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nBackground: Otonoshi dies. He wakes up to find this mysterious girl aiming a gun. All hell breaks loose as he tries to figure what is going on and why he doesn't remember how he died, only that he died. Is this the afterlife? Purgatory? Hell? He sets out to find out.\\n\\n\r\nReading some other reviews, I noticed the story received a rather low score for some people. I, personally enjoyed the questions about the afterlife and each character's back-story. It made the anime feel more personal, as if you can feel their pain and empathize their suffering. Each character has a flaw in some way, and is paramount to each of their personalities. Otonoshi, the main character, interacts with others just like him and comes to terms with himself throughout the anime. Oddly, there seem to be a ton of supporting cast, many who barely appear for a couple minutes, then fade into oblivion. They don't seem to contribute much to the story, other than to offer a distraction or comedic relief for a couple seconds or minutes. Also, the story begins markedly slow, yet picks up pace much faster than it ought to (think a e^x graph for you math people). Overall, though, the story was enjoyable, funny at times and made the viewer wonder where the next plot twist would come from.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nVisually, this anime was stunning. Beautiful backgrounds and settings, detailed characters and multiple camera angles offered a wonderful amalgamation of visually appealing sensations. I continually made mental notes of how the water sparkled or the hair fluttered just so - it added to the surreal mood of the anime. Everything was drawn to near-perfection, and when needed the art become dull and drab to reflect foreboding or light and colorful to indicate happiness or comedy. I couldn't find a flaw anywhere within this beautiful artwork. The school uniforms were pretty, yet the members of the SSS had different clothing on, symbolizing their differences with those NPCs. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP was incredible. Beautiful and nostalgic sounding, it perfectly matched the mood of the anime. The ending hit home even more, sounding like a good-bye, but a tearful good-bye. Paired wonderfully with each other, they both foreshadowed and epitomized the underlying theme of the anime. The voice-acting was decent, never getting too crazy but not too dull either. I wasn't much impressed with the background music, but the sound effects were astounding. The gunshots and clashing of metal were accurate; I've shot many weapons before, and those guns sounded exactly realistic. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOk, here's where it gets iffy. I definitely loved Otonoshi and his story, as well as Yuri and especially Tenshi. These three characters drove the story to its climax and beyond. They never faltered in their personal quests, and became a foundation to the overall success of this anime. Then there were the supporting characters. I mentioned before that they did little to enhance the storyline, other than to offer some humor and jokes. Sometimes they became pretty fundamental, but there were so many useless characters I kind of got tired of seeing them appear. I mean, sure I loved their little sound-bites and humor, but I think this anime would have flowed much better if it focused more on the big three (not Churchill, Stalin and Roosevelt, mind you). I wanted more interaction with those three characters; their development, I feel like, was cut short. There were not enough episodes to fully develop them. The ending seemed rushed and stressful. So, no, it wasn't perfect. But it had potential.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI could have given this a 10/10. It was within my grasp. I loved almost everything: story, drama, action, guns, romance, comedy. It had every tool in the arsenal to make this a perfect story. But alas, it became too much like something else and failed to meet all my expectations; however, it still amazed me and continued to impress me throughout the whole story. It kept me riveted and piqued my interest, but it wasn't perfect. The animation and sound quality were above average, and overall I thoroughly enjoyed most characteristics of this wonderful anime. However, it wasn't perfect and its execution wasn't great. But nonetheless, it is one of my favorites already. Remember: life is beautiful. The afterlife, not so much.",

            "content": "Angel Beats was one of my first anime. The story isn't that composed, the art is just so-so, but there's something about angel beats that people simply cannot ignore.\r\nOverall: 8\r\nThe story is quite fascinating and fresh (considering that the genre was afterlife), but a little fast-paced. The art is beautifully clean but nothing special. The slapstick comedy and the \"jokes only dead people can do\" are very enjoyable yet not only concentrated on comedy.\r\nWhat makes angel beats special is the other two elements.\r\nI wish to elaborate on those, but I feel like I'd write a 10-page long thesis if I did, so I'll hold myselfback.\\n\r\nSo, let's dissect the score.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nI had really enjoyed the story, however I'll still give seven with a grain of salt. The reason is simple; the story is not elaborate. Unlike Baccano, which uses time element as a twist in the story, and Fullmetal Alchemist, which uses the surprise as the hook, Angel Beats is pretty plain in terms of story. While I admit that there were twists in the end, I don't see how concealing that twist was a great story factor as a whole. Sure, it was emotional and all, but it was quite meaningless besides answering some unanswered questions.\\n\r\nStill, the very fact that the anime uses afterlife as the stage fascinated me and got me interested. The wish to know the life of each characters was the hook that had me going through the story. Moreover, the action scenes of the SSS was a very sweaty show, making my heart skip as the two knives clashes.\\n\r\nSo, as I said, I give seven with a grain of salt.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe character is your everyday moe characters, and there's nothing special about them. The real beauty of the art of the anime comes from the detailed background. For almost the entire anime, the background never is covered by a single or two color panels. For some comedic events, there were few panels appropriate for the situation, but overall, the background and the extras were drawn detailed.\\n\r\nThe only minus factor was the failure to show the emotions of some of the characters (which I'm not going to reveal because it's a spoiler). Sadness, happiness, \"yandereness\" or psychotic-ness, anger or a very \"hyper\" feelings have been well-demonstrated, but more subtle emotions like anguish, indecisiveness, nostalgia or the like have been not well-demonstrated. While I understand that these facial expressions are very hard to express, I'll still be critical about my judgment as this is a review, not a simple love-hate fact.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe opening/s were really out of these world! The small yet very gentle piano beginning to the crucial-like climax was very coherent to the theme and the story of the anime. Moreover, the anime used other songs as another beauty factor. The entire anime uses more than 10 songs but they aren't just factory-made like other anime. They are each beautified and used in appropriate situations.\\n\r\nMoreover, LiSA was really a great impact to the notoriety of the anime. Not only is she good in singing, but also she is good in performances and therefore is a natural marketing goddess. She knows how to treat the concerts unlike other singers who become famous and forget all about their fans.\\n\r\nAdding on to LiSA, her alternative opening was a very wonderful idea. By showing the viewers a rock version to the opening, both the intensity lovers and classic lovers could enjoy angel beats' songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nAlthough I said the story was quite plain, it wasn't so for the characters and their development. The behind stories of the members of SSS was not only touching and saddening but also a hint of obstacle. The afterlife, ironically, was just like life without death. The characters are faced with a horrible reality--the same reality that made them oblige rather than lead. While living, they keep asking themselves a very painstaking question; why is God doing this to us?\\n\r\nIndeed, why are they doing that to them?\\n\r\nBy answering this question and going over their reality, they finally want to live again, this time without obligatory mind.\\n\r\nThe characters, moreover, are very well-used. The \"sidekicks\" didn't remain a sidekick. The author did a phenomenal job of giving them a role. Although that role might not be the main character, they were the centers of each arcs. They weren't just sidekicks but also the main characters.\\n\r\nFor this amazing job of distributing roles, I give 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nAs I had said before, the slapstick comedy is quite interesting. Moreover, by using the afterlife theme as a weapon, the author used jokes that could only be used in afterlife. However, there were too much unneeded profanities in the joke. While I know that the profanities were kept at bare minimum, I didn't think that the jokes were 1) downright funny or 2)supposed to be funny.\\n\r\nStill, this is a very self-centered opinion, so I didn't include this in the minus point.\\n\r\nThe minus 2 came from some unnecessary events. I didn't see how one event connected to another beside being funny. At the worst, the entire episode was just a summation of pure comedy. This was unnecessary, and downright annoying, so I gave minus 2.\\n\\n\r\nWell thanks for reading my review.",

            "content": "Character\r\nOtanashi is dead, but is also the protagonist of the story. This may seem weird but it really gives Angel Beats! Its own identity. Otonashi wakes up in the familiar environment of a high school with no memory besides his name. He is quickly informed that he is in fact dead, and is in a purgatory like environment where teenagers who died without accomplishing anything can live out there childhoods which were troubled before they died, and will disappear once they find fulfillment in their new life though many students don't want to disappear and form the SSS to fight against god for giving themsuch tragic lives. Otonashi soon joins the \"like-hell-I'm-dead-battlefront\" or SSS. Otonashi is now caught up in a battle against god itself.\\n\\n\r\nIn Angel Beats! I'd say 99% of the cast is dead, the other 1% of the cast are just small roles in the flashbacks of the former lives of (sadly) a very small number of the VERY large cast, too large in fact to give everyone there own moments, but the anime is only 14 episodes long including the one OVA. While it would have been easy to just have each episode reveal a certain characters past Key decides to advance the plot through \"operations\" against the series antagonist While each character does fit into the story well, only about 4 maybe 5 ( depending on if you count a certain baseball player) get a flashback, while these flashbacks into the lives of the characters are few they are very powerful. I've seen multiple people get very emotional during these flashbacks.\\n\\n\r\nThere are, in my opinion 3 main characters, Otonashi, who the story follows, Yuri or \"Yuripee\" the leader of the \"SSS\" who fight against Angel, the anime's main antagonist, and last but not least \\n\r\nAngel who is as I just said is the main antagonist. There are several important sub-characters like Hinata and Naoi. While others seem to be there for comic relief, like everyones favorite character TK, who among a sea of Japanese voices TK's signature broken English phrases never cease to amuse the viewer, I also like think that if he did have a flashback he would have been the voice behind DDR. Other characters never go anywhere like Ooyama, fujimaki, takayama, takamatsu, the band, Noda, Matsushita and many others. Despite the long list of \"unimportant\" characters they all still somehow hold some emotional attachment to me, the show accomplishes this through comedy all of the sub characters have about them that that makes them quirky and funny. While Angel Beats! Stumbles with length issues the attachment you will feel towards nearly every charcter makes this anime very compelling.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI'm not very picky about the art of anime, Angel Beats! art does stand out to me. Key pays particular attention to lighting in this anime, like how light casts a shadow and how it generally reacts to the environment which they do well. I feel that the particular art style does fit the mood and tone of the anime very well the generally soft color pallet does make the anime visually appealing. Another interesting and refreshing aspect is that while characters talk they do move, which may not seem important but is a nice touch. Sorry for the short art review but I'm not that picky with art.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI, can't find anything to complain about in Angel Beats! Sound. The opening song really fits its easy to believe that Angel really would play the song on the piano. The more upbeat (which isn't super upbeat but still happier) opening really gets you ready to hear Yuri's crazy operations, while the ending captures the usually depressing endings of each episode. Also the general background music truly fits the situation that is currently occurring. Overall a good soundtrack that I continue to listen to over and over again. The voice actors are top notch they really sell the story they are a HUGE part of the believability of Angel Beats!\\n\\n\r\nFun\\n\r\nAngel Beats! Is always interesting, I was hooked from start to finish which took about a week. I actually stopped at episode 11 because I didn't want it to end but eventually I had to finish it. While I won't spoil anything the ending is the only anime ending I've ever shed a tear to. Key uses many different tactics to get the viewer to truly care about the characters, besides the pure sympathy used with the main characters, humor is effectively used with sub-characters. Even though these characters never get the spotlight you will probably remember things about each one. With it's familiar yet, strange setting of a high school , memorable characters and a story that holds you until very end Angel Beats! Is a truly special anime I can't wait until season 2 I highly recommend checking out Angel Beats!\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Angel Beats. What an Anime, what a story. A short story considering some of the Anime out there, but is far from a weakness. \r\nIn this review, I would like to convince everyone questioning if they should watch this anime or not, to watch it. The review will be spoiler-free up until the last part where I will be reviewing the end in detail (I will tag a spoiler there, so just stop reading when you get that far).\r\nThe first episodes of the anime I was kinda questioning everything. Who is this \"Angel\" why is everyone in this world? Why are they rebelling against this\"Angel\", how did everyone get there? And do not worry. All these questions will be answered during the show. I am not gonna lie. The first episodes were indeed a bit hard to understand, which made it kinda questionable if I enjoyed it or not. But I kept watching, and it became more and more awesome.\\n\\n\r\nEverything becomes so well explained, and everything goes so well together. I promise you that you will enjoy one of the best Anime I have watched, with the best ending I've ever seen in ANY movie/show/anime EVER. (I will discuss the ending further down). The last episode will leave you with the feeling as you have been hungry for days and you just ate the best meal of your life. As if you have been thirsty for days and just drank your favorite refreshment. As if you have been wanting nicotine for a long time and finally get it. You will be finished. You will be fed up, unthirsty and satisfied. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the soundtracks. Oh the soundtracks. I am listening to them as I am writing this review, as the soundtracks are so emotional and well made. They complete the anime. Everything from the band to the op and the outro song plays its part in the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe only reasoning for giving 9/10 instead of a full score of 10/10 is due to that the plot might be weak at times in the early/mid episodes. For the score of the ending, I give 100/10. \\n\\n\\n\r\nENDING/SPOILERISH REVIEW COMES NOW. IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE ANIME YET, STOP READING HERE AND GO WATCH IT RIGHT NOW. COME BACK TO READ THIS ONCE YOU'VE FINISHED.\\n\\n\r\nHow I cried. How I fucking cried. I cried to the point of no longer feeling like a man, rather a baby that had his candy stolen. I have never been more amazed of a ending like this in my entire 19-year old life. Yokatta mi to. Happy for them. (op song). The tears of pure happiness and satisfaction is what I would describe them as. Everyone, leaving the world feeling so satisfied with everything. How Yuzuru confronted Kanade with his love. How Kanade couldn't say I love you back because she would disappear. (Many people are calling this romance uncalled for and I will come to this a bit further down). How Yurippe said good bye. (Jaa ne, an informal friendly, will definitely see you later. )\\n\\n\r\nThere is no easy way of describing the questions I had in my head after watching this anime. Just the whole feel around everything after the end totally changed. When we saw how Yuzuru died and came to this world by donating his organs I got goosebumps. When Kanade said she was the one who got Yuzuru's heart I swear I got goosebumps from my toes to my hair. I swear that even the inside of my eyeball got goosebumps. This is the strongest moment I have witnessed in my entire life. And it goes over a lot of IRL stuff I've seen. \\n\\n\r\nIt can't be put to words, simple as that. How all of these people had an unfulfilling life before they came there and had a blast. It can really compare to a lot of stuff in the real world. The track \"My song\" from Masami Iwasawa made a lot more impact after knowing she would disappear to a happier life. How she lost her voice and couldn't sing in the real world no matter how much she loved it, and now coming to this world, she can sing as much as she want. It's too beautiful to put to words, as much of this anime is.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding Yuzuru (Otonashi) and Kanade's romance in the end. A lot of people said they \"cringed\" when Yuzuru confessed to Kanade, as it was \"uncalled for\". For me, this is a questionable way of describing it. Yuzuru was the guy who always questioned why they attacked her. He was the one who saw straight through her and realized she is actually a human-being with a lot of feelings held up inside her. Yuzuru was the one to make Kanade open up.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, I always believed that Yuzuru had something for Kanade. He loved her. Yes, it is a relationship built over a very little period of time, but how can this affect how strong it is? Kanade is carrying Yuzuru's heart, and even before Yuzuru knowing this, he loved her. How can this not be bound by faith?  To me, how fast a relationship progresses doesn't matter as long as it is STRONG. Which is exactly what Yuzuru and Kanade's releationship is.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on, and on, and on about this anime. But I am gonna leave it at these final words:\\n\\n\r\nIf there is something this anime has taught me, it is this: Some people are struggling. Some people are having problems some of us can't imagine exists. But it doesn't stop them from having a big heart, and it doesn't stop them from fighting on. So whenever you are facing some uphill battles, continue. As you never know what the reward will be for finally getting up that hill and letting go of the past, thus accepting your problems and struggles to move on.",

            "content": "For being only 13 episodes Angel Beats! was very enjoyable! The concept of teens with lingering feelings trapped in a sort of limbo after death is interesting and unique idea. \r\nThings I liked:\r\nThe story - The show was designed to be entertaining while leading up to deeper moments that give the viewer the feels. The writers did a great job of presenting the material in that way.\r\nThe art - The characters were beautiful and fun to watch.\r\nThe sound - The intro song is absolutely perfect for the series. I also really appreciated the small focus on music for some of the characters.\r\nThings that could havebeen better (IMO):\\n\\n\r\nThe characters - I hate putting this in this section, because while I was rather fond of the characters, I got a sort of lacking feeling from some of them. The romances were definitely touching and at face value well expressed, HOWEVER, they seemed a little bit random and lacked a solid foundation in my opinion. That being said it didn't really bother me too much, but nonetheless did. \\n\\n\r\nParts of the story - It is possible that I had small issues with parts of the story that were only issues to me. BUT there are certain places where the story didn't seem fully fleshed out to me (ex. the romances I previously explain). In addition, I still feel the whole \"world\" they were in seemed a bit random. (Trying not to give anything away, so being vague) We learn some things about Angel along the way, but its never fully explained what her role is and why she functions so differently from the rest. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI suppose I was just expecting a lot more because I had heard so much about the show, THAT BEING SAID I did really enjoy watching it. From the beautiful art, interesting plot, and likable characters I would definitely recommend watching it. The small issues I had with the show are merely nitpicky since it is only a 13 episode series. All in all its a great show, I was just a tad underwhelmed. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Angel Beats is one of the most, most, underrated anime ever. Receiving anything below 9 overall is actually an insult to such a beautiful, beautiful experience; juggling adrenaline pumping action, well smoothed out romances, thrills and an incredible amount of tear jerking scenarios\u2014Angel Beats is unbelievable at many moments.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nAngel Beats steps into a deep, spiritual realm, crafting a story about restless souls who are living their afterlives in a place resembling Purgatory; without moving on. As already ironed out in the main page's plot summary, Angel Beats has an interesting plot driving it, as both you (and the spirits) discover the truth behind movingon, as well as the memories of Yuzuru, and the role of the ever mysterious Tenshi (Angel), and that ending oh my god\u2014story at its very best. So simple, so effective.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nEverything here. Everything here is perfect. I can't find anything wrong, but I can't give it a 9/10 either\u2014that wouldn't be fitting. So I'm gonna give this one a 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nWith a stunning intro AND a stunning outro, Angel Beats already nails first impressions and leaving impressions. In-anime OSTs are also well composed and executed: at sad scenes, the music is almost coaxing you to shed tears and at funny ones, it's tickling your funnybone. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nAngel Beats has a whole wide cast of loveable, interesting characters. Giving each of them sufficient screen time and exposure is pretty much impossible given how short this show is. Nevertheless, there's still an incredible amount of exposure and development. Aside from stellar writing for Tenshi, Yuri, Yuzuru and Hinata; many other characters have been brought forward fantastically, cue Yui, Naoi, TK (you love him eventhough he's spewing nonsense half the time), Fifth and so on.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\n10 here, no argument, no compromise. One does not simply enjoy Angel Beats: you savour every moment, enjoy the ride and look back and reflect on how immense something so short can be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nI'd give Angel Beats a 9.5, round that off to get a 10. I don't even feel awkward for giving it a fat 10, it's that good and I've literally watched no anime as short as this, deliver such a punch, and attach you so tightly to its cast. Some of those mega long anime should take a leaf from this one, like seriously. If you haven't watched this masterpiece yet, don't hesitate, go for it.\\n",

Also English isn't my main language.\r\nNote: This review contains just a little spoiler that you will see in the first or second episode.\r\nI was always seeing Angel Beats photos like if it can make you cry it is good so i actually didn't want to start cause \u0131 just thought that it is one of the anime that just makes you cry and doesn't have any quality rather than that.\r\nAnyway i started watching it eventhough i saw the tag super natural in it (I was very bored of SCI-FI bythen) and what i found was truely amazing.\\n\r\nThey told me i'll cry a lot. Bullshit! I've laughed just a lot than i cry and when you take an overall look you can see that the domain parts are the happy parts.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Angel Beats is briefly about reincarnation... The anime takes part in a world between the real world and the world that you will go for your reincarnation. And of course the world that they are in has an angel (?) which try to stop.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that i really have to say is the music. An absolute entertainment! This was a very big surprise for me. It wasn't only the opening  and endings that were amazing. Also the band in it was truely beautyful. \\n\\n\r\nFirst \u0131 was considered giving characters a '7' but then i realised that that there was quite original characters such as T.K. (You'll understand when you see him)\\n\\n\r\nThere actually is no need to talk about enjoyment. It takes all your attention and doesn't let you breathe for a second.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u0131t was an amazing experience which made me breathless. Though there is one thing that mattered to me as hell was the ending of Angel Beats.\\n\r\nIt isn't about being original or not but i just felt like as if  they could create a better ending.",

            "content": "As one who had taken to Clannad with a passion that fizzled to a very, very flat note long before the first Season ended, it was understandable that I was more than a bit hesitant about Angel Beats! Why...? Both were done by the Key brand, as was Air, another series I am a bit on the wall about. Don't get me wrong, Clannad was okay...I am just not a huge fan of characters like Nagisa, and I had found myself willing certain episodes to just \"get it over with already.\" Never-the-less, I decided to give Angel Beats a shot, thinking \"What's the harm withwatching only one episode anyway?\"\\n\\n\r\nWell, 13 episodes later, as the credits for the last episode rolls and I am here sniffing like a baby, I can truly and wholeheartedly say: to watch ONLY one episode of Angel Beats, would be doing yourself a great injustice. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\n------\\n\r\nThe storyline behind Angel Beats is actually a rather unique one--not something you see very often today with anime.  It focuses on a \"sort of\" Purgatory after-life, for kids. As in, after children/teens die in the human world, should they have died with any regrets, instead of passing right along to Heaven they are taken to a boarding school for the after life.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, things at this school would seem to be no different from that of others in the human world...that is until one find themselves landing in the dead middle of some sort of long-ongoing feud: one that involves axes, knives, guns, and a rather stoic \"Angel.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe overall premise is pretty interesting: Young people having the chance to live out their lives and fulfill their wishes, despite the fact that they had died so early (It's kind of something you would actually to hope exist in reality, too many young people die everyday without being able to fulfill their dreams--whether it be something like making new friends, or being able to play a sport--its good if they could have that at some point).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\n-----\\n\r\nLike all things done by Key, Angel Beats is pleasing to the eyes. The artwork is not over the top, nothing fancy, but still very detailed, very crisp, very clear, and very defined. There are really no faults to be found with it. The characters all had their own unique faces, even the NPC students who are really nothing more than Fodder for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nWhile pleasing though, the art really is still average, there is nothing very special about it--just good, quality, solid work.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\n-------\\n\r\nIf you like whimsical pieces, tunes that make you reflect--but not too deeply--and an opening that makes you think of the anime long after you've even watched it, then you will like the music in Angel Beats! The Opening was by far my favorite, as it matches the series well and even stirred the same emotions I got from watching the actual episodes. \\n\\n\r\nSadly though, there are not that many pieces to be heard overall, which is disappointing because its the kind of series that could have done with some beautiful orchestra for the emotional bits, and some nice fight music to go along with the good moves displayed by the characters. \\n\\n\r\nMusic aside, the real winner here are the voices. The voice actors did a great job with their individual characters, as every voice found the perfect home. While the OST kept it simple yet fitting, the voices were excellent and top quality, matching each personality perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nOh! Oh! My goodness. If I were to write how I really felt about the characters in Angel Beats, this would turn into a long wall of flowery text. I LOVED THEM. Every single one of them. This a very rare thing for me. Usually, I either hate them all, or can like only 1 and 2 characters, but not for this series. ALL of them are Great.\\n\\n\r\nEach character has their own unique personality and back-story. No one just fades in the background like wallpaper, nor is any one of them unimportant. Each character adds their own spice to the series, not one of them could have been left out and still kept the series as good as it is.\\n\\n\r\nYuzuru Otonashi--the main male--is superb. His contradicting attitude opposite the other main characters, makes for one HILARIOUS series. When events unfold, Yuzuru says what you, the watcher, is thinking. He's the sane one of the bunch--being the newest school arrival--and often the voice of reason. His side remarks, comments, and the fact that he usually \"says\" instead of simply thinking, will have you rolling and enjoying every minute of every episode.\\n\\n\r\nAngel--a stoic little one, who has a hard time conveying her emotions. She is the perfect balance opposite Yuzuru, who always says what's on his mind, and can easily convey his emotions. Angel is also the \"little-girl-who-kicks-major-butt-in-a-cool-and-intimidating-way\".\\n\\n\r\nThen there is Noda--an over the top fan of his \"leader\", and an antagonist to everyone else. He's willing to fight anything and everything, at anytime..even a door...should the mood strike him.\\n\\n\r\nThere is Takeyama, the computer wizz who tries in very episode to get people to call him \"Christ\",  a request that is always completely and totally ignored--in the most comical ways.\\n\\n\r\nI could keep listing and going on and on, but then I would ruin the whole series. Point is: They are all great, and each and everyone brings something to the table. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\n------------\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series tremendously. The only real downside I have is that it is way too short. With 13 episodes it really was hard to reflect on each character the way it should have. With so many interesting characters, it would have been good to give them each quality screen time when it came to facing their regrets, tackling their fears, and fulfilling their dreams. I don't mind the material that was provided, but it all could have been built upon some more. Had that been done (along with some more powerful music) this would have been a master gem.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nAngel Beats is no heavy brain buster.  It doesn't have a complex plot, and a bunch of twists, turns, and surprise elements. But that makes it no less deep and no less emotional. And yes, I did say emotional as while I found myself laughing out of control for every episode, I was also bawling my eyes out in the next minute. It is touching, think of it...young people who died. Everyone's story touches the heart.\\n\\n\r\nAs for me saying deep...it is indeed that. Beneath all the laughs and sad stories, you will find another layer--one that surely made me think for a more than a minute. There is a moment when the laughter fades, the heavy heart gives in a bit more, and a new tone emerges. Watch it attentively and you will see it. If you do, I think you'll be able to appreciate the series even more.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes it really is good to just relax and accept a series as is. Like life, sometimes it is good to just roll with the punches and enjoy the simple things. It's okay to laugh, instead of trying to solve complex puzzles and deep plots. Gems do not always have to be the work-of-art that is the most elaborated, the most polished...\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats is not a series I would have picked to watch had I decided to remain in my box. I surely underestimated it, I enjoyed every episode, every moment, from beginning to end. I am glad that I picked it thinking: \"What's the harm with watching only one episode anyway?\"\\n\\n",

            "content": "One of the best things about watching an anime series are the first few episodes, a time during which you form a general opinion about it and get to know the characters. Nothing beats a great start, that\u2019s for sure, and it is then that we decide whether the series is worth following all the way through. Most recently I have been watching an anime series called Angel Beats!, which managed to grab my attention due to its unconventional plot and the impressive animation (or so I heard). While it was slightly difficult to fully comprehend its intentions at first, there\u2019s no doubt that AngelBeats! had one of the most striking first episodes I have seen in any series to this day.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like the main character Yuzuru Otonashi, we are thrown directly into the action and must deal with a good amount of information in order to even begin to understand what exactly is going on. Usually, this kind of task makes for some dull moments and ends up making things less enjoyable, but the initiation in Angel Beats! is put well together and it avoids feeding us with anything but information that is vital to our understanding of the story. Due to the fact that the plot and setting are also quite unique, the desire to learn what is going on ends up getting a solid boost.\\n\\n\r\nAfter waking up, Yuzuru Otonashi finds himself in a world after death where a group of rebels a fighting against Tenshi, the student council president that wants to put them all in their right place. The only real location in this supposed afterlife is a high school attended mostly by NPCs. Eventually, Otonashi ends up joining the rebel group known as the SSS in order to avoid being \u201cobliterated\u201d by attending classes and leading a normal life. Most of the episodes deal with the ongoing conflict between the SSS and Tenshi, but variations and new additions are certainly not absent as the story progresses.\\n\\n\r\nThe strong points of this anime lie in the intriguing and mostly well-developed characters and its humour. These two kinda go hand in hand as most of the laughs come from character-driven humour. A lot of the characters have certain signature moves that make for a lot of comedy along the way, such as the mysterious girl of the group only saying the phrase \u201cHow unwise.\u201d during most situations, or the geeky dude asking everyone to call him Christ. One highly interesting character is T.K., who wears a large bandana that covers his eyes and can only speak English (well, mostly). He is, simply put, awesome, but it\u2019s also one of those see-it-to-believe-it things, so this is about all I can say on this matter.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t take a genius to realize that the music in Angel Beats! is well above the average that you would expect and there are some really good songs that we get to hear along the way. The opening song left an impression on me and the other ones were not too far back either. There\u2019s a particular scene in one of the earlier episodes which involves a song played on an acoustic guitar. Needless to say, that scene was one of the most memorable and emotional of the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nAnother impressive aspect of Angel Beats! is its beautiful visual design. The animation is one of the best I have seen recently and the visuals are simply put outstanding. It is truly a delight to watch this series and the good amount of entertainment that it delivers makes things even better. It\u2019s hard not to like Angel Beats! with all the things going for it, but sadly it is also hard to rank it among favourites due to its significant flaws.\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats! is an anime that follows a very different path than most of the others, yet ends with a surprisingly typical conclusion. Every episode is an exciting one and the anime almost always finds a way to spice things up or introduce new elements to the story. Unfortunately, most of the things we come across hold little to no importance in the end. Let\u2019s just say that the episode before the finale ends with a bang and leaves a lot of things in the open, yet the final episode then goes on to finish with twenty emotional minutes that, unfortunately, deliver little satisfaction in terms of concluding everything. Barely anything is explained, although I guess that\u2019s understandable since I heard that it was already known thirteen 20-minute episodes would not be enough to wrap things up. Still, a different ending would have been greatly appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I believe that Angel Beats! is well worth checking out. You won\u2019t find many anime series that look as stunning as this one does, and even though the conclusion may leave most with a bad taste in their mouths, there are lots of things that make up for that. You\u2019ve got some really great characters and there are plenty memorable moments that impress either through humour, emotion or simply the way they are played out. Plus, it\u2019s all a heck of a lot of fun to watch and boredom will most likely never be an issue. Enjoy the ride!",

            "content": "Angel Beats! is my favorite anime in spring 2010. And Angel is one of my favorite characters all time. And as of episode 7, good for you Otonashi :D\r\nI will refer to Clannad a lot in this review because first the same guy wrote it, and second Clannad AS is my favorite anime.\r\nStory\r\nWell at first glance, a bunch of people trying to fight God may seem really cliche to lots of people and so was I. But however, the fact that this story is written by Maeda Jun (KEY) makes the story not so cliche. Why? For those of us who watched Clannad and Airor other Key production will understand that Jun Maeda is a master at making people guessing around in circles thinking that \"Oh, I already know how this is going to end\" and ended up being toyed around by Jun. , the story started off with a original setting. Not human world, not hell or heaven, but rather a world that is in between which serves as a transition. As of episode 7, many of the hypothesis by online people (Yes, I do go on to many forums to discuss each every episode after their weekly release) were smashed into pulps by Maeda Jun. I'm not going to go deep into story because it is only episode 7, there are just too many unknown elements going around. But let me say this, I'm actually more hyped about Angel Beats! than Clannad when it was airing because Angel Beats! is not an adaption from anything, which means that there will not be anyone (except the animators...) that knows what is to come and spoil the whole surprise elements.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (contain a little spoiler) is the main reason I'm writing this review right now. Many people have been saying that the characters in Angel Beats! is really shallow or very cliche like the haruhi clone(?), and the cliche \"main male character that has lost his memories\" and from that point many of us assumed that his memories is probably one of the key elements in understanding the story and the afterlife world. But after watching episode 7, the cliche character feeling was smash into outer space, our guesses were wrong once again leaving the viewers clueless as to what the heck is going to happen next.\\n\\n\r\nSound is pretty good, like Clannad, most of the music is written by Jun Maeda himself. Especially the op and ed, just beautiful. The insert songs are fabulous too, and my favorite right now is ep 5 \"Thousand Enemies\", even though at first it didn't really stand out like \"Alchemy\" but it grew on me.\\n\\n\r\nArt is well... one of the main hype about Angel Beats! is due to the supposedly \"good\" animation quality. But truthfully I'm kinda disappointed about the animation quality. Despite the beautiful scene during the concerts, regularly, the characters look like background characters. Sometimes the character's legs (female) looks like two pipes coming down from their skirts without the feel of skin or muscle curves and such. Even though Angel looks fabulous during the fighting scenes, but in episode 5 when Angel stopped Otonashi from leaving the class room, her body just looked weird... and not even mentioning the epic fail on Yuri's hand in episode 1. But overall, most the time the art looks nice so I gave it an 8.\\n\\n\r\nLastly Enjoyment. Like I said in the beginning, Angel Beats! is my awesome, so awesome that I can't wait to know what's going to happen next. It makes me laugh to tears at times, and makes me felt really sad sometimes (ep5 cough*). Every friday I check online almost every 2 hours hoping to see a new episode is released. There isn't really any word to describe how much I enjoy this show (let alone I watched episode 5 3 times on the release day)\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it a 9, but it does have the potential to receive a 10 depending on the next 6 episodes like what happened in the later half of Clannad AS.",

            "content": "This will be a quick review. This will be an honest review. This will be a scathing review. \r\nAngel beats, to describe briefly for anyone curious as to why it fails, is a show for those who think placing characters in sad situations makes for a sad scene. Without any concern for making the audience care for the characters or story, you are expected to convey emotion according to how the show wants you to. Its a manipulative show for these who think simple emotions are \"deep\", when in fact this show is so exterior I found myself unable to connect with a single characteror the story. I read the word \"feels\" so often in comments after watching each episode it made me infuriated. I asked myself, \"what about any of these situations made you feel anything close to an emotion?\". You want \"feels\"?, Watch Ano Hana.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n Story:\\n\r\nWhile initially interesting, Angel Beats changes directions so erratically I thought throughout the show it was a Sh\u014dnen, then a comedy, then a slice of life, and then a romance. Coinciding with each of these story lines were jarring tonal shifts that made me wonder if the stream I was watching had skipped forward in the episode. One of the six or so plot lines is actually developed , and the one that is developed is so ridiculous you will be punching yourself for watching 13 episodes of a show that's story really only needed 3. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAngel beats is full of paper thin characters whose motivations are as fickle as the plot. That's all there is to say about them. With maybe the exception of one , Iwasawa. If the show had made  Iwasawa the main character, and spent 13 episodes developing her this show could have been great. As far as the other characters are concerned, in the eyes of the show, their only value are as sob stories, tools to bait the audience into feeling something. Their personalities don't matter because the story doesn't make any attempt to develop their personalities. And without spoiling anything I will say that the last episode from a character perspective makes absolutely no god dam sense. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n The saving grace of this show is the soundtrack. The opening and the music in the show performed by the band are the only reason to watch this show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThis show is the equivalent of a Facebook video one of your friends shared where you watch some kid who's dying of cancer hug his mom,  followed by one of those old \"save the African children\" ads with Sarah McLachlan. Most people will feel sad, and that's fine, its instinct. However this capricious sadness you feel for the cancer kid and Angel Beats is not visceral, it should not stick with you for more than a second and it will not impact your life or change your point of view. True emotions are produced when we as humans become invested in something, when we really care. Weather that emotion is elation, morose, or vexation, do not confuse a temperamental sentiment, for a true feeling.",

It felt more plagiarized and forceful. The idea was there with purgatory and the characters known and some didn't know and the shadow creatures taking their souls away forcing them to do something they didn't want to do by attending a normal class and being successful and more. The character's death wasn't all that realistic and emotional. The soundtrack was off the charts most of the timeexcept for the main characters playing the songs though. It's not that well thought out either for the character's leave when she was playing the song for the band's play. The main female character didn't had anything special for her character's personal and so as the main male character. I wish the club had more thought to it. They should've explored the place more often except of staying in the school because of Angel. If it was that easy with the shadows, then why couldn't they leave then?! There was a bigger world out there.",

            "content": "What a let down. I went into Angel Beats expecting a sloppy narrative I could tear to pieces. Instead I got something essentially competent. I suppose that's what I get for using the relations page of the \"Anime Uber-Elitist Club\" to satisfy my masochism.\r\nIt's only appropriate to evaluate an anime on its own terms. It wouldn't make sense to complain that an hour-long comedy film lacks the detailed characterization and historical parallels found in Legend of the Galactic Heroes. So let's dispense with complaints like the one-note nature of Angel Beats' side characters. It's a thirteen episode series and its primary goals are related tohumor, action sequences, and the development of a small cast of main characters with half-episode backstories. Leaving the side cast to their joke roles is the right choice. There's no time for them.\\n\\n\r\nStyle over substance is the cliche most commonly associated with Angel Beats. It's not completely unfair, because style is the stronger axle in its case. P.A. Works spared no effort or expense: the coloring and shading are particularly well-done, and the animation is fluid when compared with the competition. The opening is especially high-quality. They produced a lot of solid original music for the in-story band, whose performances are synchronized to to the action for a stylish, exciting effect. Even the use of title cards and headers is well-conceived and high-effort.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is fast-paced and well-structured. It manages to convey the majority of its exposition in ways that are entertaining to watch: Otonashi's introduction to the world, for instance, is tense and exciting. He has to rely on the accounts of Yuri and Tenshi to decide what to do, and both are evidently unreliable. Trusting the wrong one could be a matter of life and death - or so it seems at the time. The humor is also a strong point. I almost never laugh at Japanese comedy, but there were several different occasions that I found chuckle-worthy. The characters have enough charisma to be enjoyable to watch and to give the viewer a sense of investment. They build relationships gradually and believably, and they bring different perspectives to the situation that play off one another in some interesting ways.\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats is consistently entertaining as a result of these strengths. It's easy to imagine a lot of people binging it in one sitting. That all counts for something. Don't be too quick to disdain style in comparison to substance. Most shows have neither.\\n\\n\r\nBut let's discuss substance. Angel Beats is loosely based around the Catholic concept of Purgatory. It's set in an afterlife designed to bring fulfillment to teenagers who had tragic lives. Some people say it's a unique premise, but that isn't really the case. The essential dynamics and the school setting are familiar to us all: so much of Japanese media uses metaphor to depict people seeking happiness through the amelioration of certain regrets. They love to give physical form to emotion like that over there. It even bears a resemblance to some western media like \"Ghost Whisperer.\"\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats becomes a bit more atypical through the characters' existential rebellion. They oppose God Himself for creating a world in which they had to live through their horrible and unjust lives. This is a concept I have some respect for, and I like how it develops too: that rebellion ends up hurting them more than anything else, because they are only generating meaningless chaos. It's suitable for people who have been exposed to equally-meaningless tragedy and to their immature status - it can even be likened to a refusal to grow up. That is made clear at a few points in the story, where characters sabotage their own fulfillment, or that of others, in order to stay where they are. They eventually decide to move on, which is represented in the story by reincarnation. That serves a convenient secondary purpose - characters with complete arcs are promptly booted from the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe backstories and the plot are completely unrelated. This was unavoidable since the story takes place in the afterlife. That's unfortunate, because it means that the show is incapable of creating the kind of satisfaction that comes from a completely cohesive narrative. But they're still relevant because they inform the characters' actions. Yuri, who had the cruelest and most unjust life, is the progenitor of the rebellion and has the hardest time abandoning it. In contrast, Otonashi, who wished to become a doctor, ends up taking on a healer's role by providing the alternative.\\n\\n\r\nThose past tragedies are explored through long flashbacks. The good pacing shows here: they are usually strong - or at least attention-grabbing - as self-contained stories, so that they don't feel slow or boring. They also provide a distinct separation between the darkest parts of the show and the comedy, so that Angel Beats cannot rightly be accused of containing jarring tonal shifts. Outside of the backstories, none of the violence has any real weight, due to the mechanics of the world - no one can die or even suffer injury. It's a good decision for comedic purposes. It lets the show use morbid jokes without destroying the tone. A lot of the comedy proceeds from the mechanics of the afterlife and how they change people's behavior.\\n\\n\r\nBut it introduces a separate problem. Nothing is ever at stake in Angel Beats. No one can die, and pain is rendered meaningless through the comedy. The threat of disappearing exists at first but is ultimately undermined. Another mechanic gets introduced to give a sense of threat for the last episodes. It ends up being meaningless too. Losing possessions is irrelevant because anything can be magically fashioned from dirt - which is the show's biggest mistake, because it undermines large segments of the story. There's an entire episode where the characters are trying to save an armory, although its entire stock could be recreated from soil. There's a plot point later involving mass theft - an unnecessary risk in light of this mechanic. The show can take refuge from that loss of tension because it is a comedy, but it isn't exclusively a comedy, and the rest of it suffers - in particular, the final \"tragic\" story-beat falls flat.\\n\\n\r\nThings get a little messier later on. It's revealed that most of the initial conflict was a result of a simple misunderstanding, which is difficult to believe because of the difference in scale between the conflict and the misunderstanding. When the final twists are all revealed, there's a poorly-explained exception to the normal rules of the world, designed to allow Otonashi to go there. There's a cheap storyline involving Tenshi's character. She makes a heroic sacrifice which will supposedly change her as a person - then the story negates it. This is contrived to keep her previous character as is, and it further undermines the show's attempts at a dramatic plot. It's not too hard to complain some more. For example, Otonashi's backstory covers a time frame that does not gel with his supposed death at seventeen. But what a nitpick that is.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a connection between Otonashi and Tenshi. It's astronomically unlikely that they would meet the way they do. I can imagine some people calling this contrived. I don't mind it. It seems like it was meant to depict them as a pair of destined lovers, in essence. There's no great reason why that concept can't exist in this story.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Angel Beats is damaged by its lack of strength as much as its flaws. The main characters end up being two-dimensional rather than truly deep. Otonashi, for example, doesn't have a very dynamic personality at all. He is mostly defined by good-will toward everyone. The strength of his character comes more from verisimilitude than depth. He's able to joke around and build relationships with the others, which humanizes him but doesn't give the viewer much to think about. Tenshi might be the weakest, since she lacks much of any individual will, which I suspect was done to enhance her appeal as a waifu-bait character. There is some merit to the themes of trauma, growing up, and moving on, but it's nothing so tremendous in terms of either depth or execution. It has none of the characteristics of a masterpiece, except perhaps its stylistic strength. It has none of the characteristics of a train-wreck either. If its production values were taken away, I would still call it good.",

All because they don't wish to see anyone else suffer the way they did. \"\r\nThis review contains minor spoilers.\r\nAngel Beats, on the surface is the adventure of rebellion consists of a group of high-schooler against an angel, to fight against the god that gave them an unfair life. The opening theme starts with the angel playing the piano elegantly and the ending theme ends with the appearances of each members of the rebellion, both of which has the perfect song, 'My Soul, Your Beats!' and'Brave Songs' which have a meaningful lyrics accompanying the beautiful melody. It's packed with comedy, romance and a bit of mystery element with each characters having their own past united with one goal, to fight for their own destiny, sharing a strong bond of friendship and supporting each other along the journey.\\n\\n\r\nThere's more to that. Youth is said to be the most precious moments in our life and we only get to live it once. But they didn't, struggling with their regrets of the past, the dreams they couldn't achieve in their youth, they refused to live their second chance and devoted their time to fight the destiny set for their past lives. The main grasp of the story is such that fulfilling the dream and regrets will make you disappear from the world that you exist in, trading the simple happiness of achieving that purpose in life will get you obliterated, leaving your friends and memories behind, if so, will you still do it? They chose not to, and stayed until the very end of the line, being side by side with their dearest friends until everyone leave eventually. Nothing can stay forever, memories are what made us brave to face the unknown darkness, regrets are the fire that ignites us to live our life to the fullest.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Angel Beats is not just an emotional roller coaster ride but it portrays the feeling of not being able to fulfill a dream, the pathway to achieve it and those who stay with you along the journey to help you achieve it. It's far more than an anime of slice of life and adventure genre. It gave departure a real meaning. To leave the past that we cling on to so desperately and to move on into an unknown future with our faith.\\n\\n\r\nEventually, everyone ends up alone, and is left with only their memories. Some roads you just have to take it on your own. But be brave, for those precious memories will never fade in this world and will always be by your side.\\n\\n",

There are many reasons why people fall in love with it: the Art, the Music, the Touching/Tragic characters backstories, the satisfying Sad Moments.\r\nBut what truly make this show special? \r\nFor me, it's the creator's ability to mix so many elements in a mere 13 episodes that earned praises from me. Really, how do you mix gun action, school life, black humor, baseball, and reincarnations without making it an odd, awkward comedy, but turn it into a touching story instead? I wouldn't have any idea. But this show had done it, and dida great job doing it.\\n\\n\r\nStory elements aide, the art and soundtracks are also wonderfully done. The color palettes and soundtracks with varying genres really help building up the mood for the story.\\n\\n\r\nIf I have to mention any flaw of this show, then maybe it's the characterization. The characters are so basic: The Bossy Girl, The Stoic Girl, The Too-Kind Guy, The Comic Relief Guy, you name it. Those so-called personalities have been used in every other anime, without anything new. Though for this show I personally didn't mind the Lack of personality development, cause I think the story-line itself was made to be more focused on the characters backstories, rather than the characters developments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed this show. I torn between giving it 8 or 9 cause it's actually 8.5 for me, but I decided on giving it 9 for the beautiful Opening & Ending themes.",

It's not exactly perfect, and it won't appeal to everyone, but I found it to be pretty great.\r\nStory: The story wasn't awful by any means, but it could have been better. I feel as though it was simply too short, as we never got a chance to fully experience everything this show could have shown.\r\nArt: The art was mostly amazing. My only real issue is that it started with a somewhat happy artistic style, and it never experienced much of a change, even during fight scenes / emotional scenes. These are just minor drawbacks from avery nice work, of course.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sounds were fantastic. I have nothing else to say on the matter, really; all the music was great, the opening theme was especially wonderful, and the characters' voices suited their personalities well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This was the only glaring problem in the show. Despite being introduced to around 15 unique and somewhat interesting characters in the beginning, it decides only to focus on 4 or 5 of these characters. Unfortunately, the ones they decided to focus on were not the ones that a lot of viewers wanted to know more about! Fortunately, it seems as though the manga is attempting to rectify this mistake, but it can't be denied that Angel Beats was far less of a show for this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed this anime; it isn't the best or most enjoyable anime out there, but it sits fairly highly with me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 9/10. To anyone who's thinking about watching it, go ahead and try it; at least try and push through the first three or four episodes, until you're absolutely positive that you dislike it, as the show really only starts to move after episode five or six (and then, it only gets emotional after around episode nine).\\n\\n\r\nDespite needing some more work (and probably a few more episodes!), this anime remains one of my favorites, and probably will for a long time.",

Because of this, they cannot \u201cmove on\u201d and rest in peace, although they consider disappearing into heaven the same as being obliterated.

I know there are people that find the characters fruitless, but they were really lovable and added comedy to the otherwise solemn show. If you\u2019re into tear jerkers, then this is the anime for you. On the other hand, if you prefer shows to be less serious, then Angel Beats may not be your cup of tea. Although the series does have its hilarious parts, the overall mood left a depressing, kind of bittersweet feel throughout. On to some critiques for the show\u2026\\n\\n\r\nI was quite disappointed on the character development throughout the series. It seemed to me that the producers should\u2019ve stretched out the anime because the characters progressed too rapidly; for example, in one episode, two characters would be fighting and then the next, they plan to marry each other. I probably would have enjoyed the show enough to give it a 10 if they decided to focus on character development. If character growth is crucial for you to enjoy a show (I am a bit like this), then you would probably give Angel Beats a 7-8 rating. Please note that this is still higher than an average show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Ratings-\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacters: 9 (Again, this would be a 10 if the character growth was better laid out\\n\r\nPlot: 8.5 (interesting, but not anything special)\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

It seemed so down to earth yet still so...distant...from this world it was incredible. \r\nThe Story: Angel Beats! was incredible. It will have you thinking up possibilities and out comes after just the 1st or 2nd episode. The story is quite sad, considering all the back stories that are told. Their are hilarious moments and they are delivered incredibly, it had me pausing to regain control of myself often. The time that happened before me watching this was when I watched GabrielIglesias' Special: I'm Not Fat I'm Fluffy. Needless to say, but I'm going to say it anyway, Angel Beats!' story is incredibly delivered, with passion and emotion, and incredibly well written.\\n\\n\r\nArt: While not as good as other anime, the art is still amazing, from the scenes to the characters' eyebrows. I loved looking at the anime and the art. All of it was visually appealing.\\n\\n\r\nThe Soundtrack: Angel Beats! had a breath taking soundtrack. All of it was original, and there are plenty of songs sung by Girls Dead Monster that I still listen to. Even the 2nd ending song, Ichiban no Takaramono (My Most Precious Treasure) is varying in emotion, just like the story. It can be heard in a sad, everyone's gone, kind of way, or in a romantic way as well (at least I can).\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: The characters and their respective voice actors delivered every sentence with an emotion of some sort. This put backing and strength into everything they say. Although, only some of the characters had an actual backstory. Either the other characters were skimmed over or were just completely mysterious.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: There is no end to how much you can enjoy this series. From slow, but interesting, and humorous conversations to fast paced action sequences. From dramatic confessions to awesome songs. A well thought out and story, soundtrack, likable (and occasionally random) characters and visually appealing art, the anime known as Angel Beats! is a stunning and heart breaking anime for anyone.\\n",

I still cry at some episodes.\r\nAt first, I was a bit confused on what was going on. \r\nSummary:\r\nOtonashi, a young teen, wakes up at a high school and has no memories. He meets Yurippe who is part of a clan to kill a girl called Angel because they all had unfair lives.\r\nLater, it shows what happened to the characters during their lives so their back stories. \r\n8/10\r\nI like the idea of this type of story because it is different, a boy waking up at a high school with no memories and a group whohas gathered to kill a girl who supposedly works for god. I haven't seen an anime like that before this one.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing which confuses me is the end though, you'll have to wait to see that.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is beautiful. Everything is well drawn and one can tell that the designers put time and effort into it. The colours are beautiful.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nice, the sound is clear and when some characters mention their pasts, it is clear the effects for it are beautiful.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well made, but in some of them I am not happy I didn't see all of their pasts and it doesn't touch on a lot of the pasts for the characters which kind of sucks.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series very much, it made me cry like a baby and it can be funny. It is a unique story and has romance a little later in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall rating for me 10/10",

Also the world built in this anime is very inconstant.\r\nI really can`t understand the high rating of this show. I admit that the consept of beeing traped in a world between death and rebirth sounds interesting but its execution is all messed up. The show tries to be a fantasy story, then it tries to be a school romance, then it tries to be a philosophical drama, then it tries to be  acomedy....etc.... messed up.",

            "content": "Angel Beats! holds a special place in my heart because it was one of the first series I watched when I was properly getting into anime. Please also bear in mind that I haven't watch this in a while. \r\nCharacters:\r\nThe characters in Angel Beats! are marvelously crafted even if they do have flaws. \r\nOur main characters are Yuri and Otonashi-kun. Yuri is an energetic leader, while Otonashi-kun is a more down-to-earth character. While their character archetypes aren't new, they are portrayed rather well. They both go through some sort of development and growth throughout the series. We also learned the motivations for what they doand why through their back stories. \\n\\n\r\nNext up, we have Angel or Tenshi. She fits well into the Kuudere archetype pretty well. Yes, we do have some development through the series as well. Despite, this we never get much back story, or motivations. \\n\\n\r\nWe also have Iwasawa and Yui, who are part of the supporting cast. They get heartbreaking back stories but not so much development.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, we have the rest of the supporting cast. Here we have wacky and weird yet so interesting and intriguing, but we never get any proper development or back story. It's a shame because they had so much potential to be fantastic characters. However, I think this was because the series was only thirteen episodes. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nThe art and visuals were absolutely stunning. Character and scenery was beautiful and captures the series perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was perfect as well. The opening and endings really pulled on your heartstrings, which made a lasted impression on me. The songs they used by Girls Dead Monster were fantastic as well. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nDead teenagers trapped in the middle of the afterlife? Guns? Battles? Sounds good to me. As far as my knowledge goes, I've never really heard of a series with a similar premise. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is filled with heartbreak and is quite a tearjerker, however it does have it's fair share of dark and sadistic (which is my type comedy). This turns out to be quite balanced at the beginning, but towards the end the comedy eventually wears away. \\n\\n\r\nMy worst complaint is that they never really explain why they hated Tenshi so much or why they thought she was actually an angel. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nIt was a blast, but just don't take it too seriously. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nWorth watching. 9/10.",

I finished the rest all in one day. This is a great anime!\r\nStory: 8\r\nOkay, so the story starts out a little slow, and in the beginning it kinda felt like the story was really dumb, but as the plot moves on, it pulls you in little by little making you want tosee the next episode immediately. Each of the story arcs, although a tad bit rushed, were very well done. I really liked how the story progresses from beginning to ending really maturing and capturing your attention. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nNot much to say here. The art wasn't particularly amazing, but it did a really good job portraying each character and scene.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nNo complaints here! Each persons voice really fit their character, and the theme songs were fine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThis is where things were a little off. In the begining you're first introduced to the characters, and it feels really rushed, (probably the reasons I stopped after the first episode) you're just thrown straight into it and it wasn't that great, but! Talk about character development. It wasn't just the main protagonist whose backstory you learn, it goes into alot of the side characters stories, and some of them even made me tear a little. Every time you learn more about the characters they grow on you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nAlthough it was a bit of a rocky start, this anime is a great one to watch. I went into it with high expectations and; although it wasn't 'an amazing tear jerking anime' I was expecting, it was definitely a great anime to watch. What really made me enjoy it was the ending. The honesty in the ending that wasn't exactly a happy ending made me cry and really felt like the best way they could've finished the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nIf your considering watching this anime and you have high expectations, lower them. But don't be scared by this, it really is a great anime.",

            "content": "Ok, I want anyone reading to know that I will kiss ass to this anime as much as I can, because of its heavily driven drama impact it has that most animes don't. To sum it up, the drama must replace an atmosphere you're in and take you in into a completely different one, which I believe this one does successfully. After finishing this anime, I have to say that I felt obligated to praise the living hell out of it, because it was such a good ride getting here. And so with that warning, I'll continue.\r\nStory: 10\r\nAlthough the ending of the anime is somewhatsad and I believe, a bit quickened to meet the demands of an episode cap at 13, it was superb and beyond anything I've ever watched before. Of course that may differ from person to person, but it was indeed spectacular nonetheless. I would have never expected at episode 1 that it would end at where episode 13 did. It was a completely nerve racking ride throughout with you having to wait an entire week for another episode. Furthermore, it's just something that is done so creatively and masterfully; a story of where young adults seeking something lost that they believe was an unfair trade of life IN a school and WITH a band (K-on anybody?).  All in all, the journey that the anime will take you will be somewhere you'll see coming, but it will make you realize its smooth transition into how you got there. Trust me, it'll be worth your weight in gold.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art is nothing short from visually pleasing. It's easy on the eyes and the setting is shown so that even though it's not the strongest point of the anime, it sure as hell is pretty damn good. Even though overused extensively in animes everywhere, the setting is first not the least displeasing due to the fact it has crisp visuals with fresh CG backgrounds. The character models all look great as well, with characters with varying styles that are all mostly easy to differentiate from one another. Overall, it's something that is not meant to be in any way the main focus of the anime, and as a result, is not spent the most time on, but still more than enough detailed that it's better than other animes. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe sound is great. That's all that I can say. It's just simply fricking great. None of the seiyuus are annoying in the slightest bit, and most of the time you want to hear more of them. (TK,  Shiina, Kanade) The BGM at first, you feel doesn't fit some of the circumstances, but it grows on you and you begin to love it. The OP is used to entrance you into the world that the anime takes place, but then the ED is used to take you back out. They both sound great and you can tell that actual time has been spent into composing the lyrics and music of the songs. (Unlike Neko Mayoi Overrun, holy crap that thing sucked)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nIt's a 10. Need to say more? ALL the cast is loved sometime or another and you'll be REALLY wanting to see more of them. Because the main cast is centered around some three or four characters, the other members are shown sparingly, and you really feel as though they are fanservice whenever they come out (Good actual fanservice, not boobflashes or pantyshots). The mains, Otonashi, Yuri, and Kanade all have haters and lovers, but without a doubt, are all complex and deep characters that all have conflicts until the very last moments of the anime, where everything is said and done to completely fulfill their desires and satisfy their lives. There isn't one person that you'll want to kill off (Actually maybe there is one devil tailed pink haired girl) and it becomes a pleasure knowing them, that at the end you'd want to thank them. (o.O ok whoa wtf)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: IT'S OVER 9000!!!!\\n\r\nNo seriously. It is. This HAS to be a must watch on your anime list if you haven't already, and MUST BE on your favorites. Even the subbers of this anime can't wait to sub it. They upload the subbed in less than a fricking day. How much more evidence can you give that it's superb and beyond. Kiss ass it may be, but be warned cause you might do the same after it's through with you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: You would know what I would give this if you've read up to here.\\n\r\nThe story is great, the art is great, the sound is great, the characters are great, and overall, this is an absolute masterpiece of drama. Even if  you aren't a big fan, you WILL thoroughly enjoy this beautiful anime. There's something in here for EVERYONE. Guns, awesomeness, action, fighting, awesomeness,  comedy, girl's band, moe characters, and did I mention awesomeness? It's just indescribable. The proportions of how much impact an anime can have on you, is that it's still just an anime, no matter how good or satisfying it is. But few of the many, FEW, have the power to impact you and make you a slave/fan of it and their work for a long time to come. I know that this is one of those few. And so, as a favor for yourself. Watch it. I guarantee you will satisfied.",

            "content": "Not sure why some people knock on this series for lacking in any area. With a 13 episode run time I thought it was extremely good. Sure it couldn't expand on everyone's back story like you;d want but it'd also set the final couple of episodes up to fail regardless of how much you wanted to learn about some of the characters.\r\nStory (9/10): Very original content that was well thought out and executed. Young teens, who happened to die on Earth, are sent to this place to fulfill the dreams they were never able to carry out during their short lives. It starts off asa comedic story about young adults doing whatever they please because they have a set rule system to live within and anything not over-the-top is attainable but the series shifts to a more serious tone over the last several episodes making it fun to watch and pretty connectable.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10): Not outstanding like a lot of other anime series but they do add their own unique flavor but the backgrounds and \"shadows\" could've been drawn out much better.\\n\\n\r\nMusic (10/10): From the opening song and the ending credits the soundtrack was outstanding. Many of the the episodes 2-10 have original songs in them as well and they added to the show more than one would figure with how they were implemented and the vocals were pretty outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10): Typically the biggest dividing point with this show was the character development as 13 episodes is a short run time. From my eyes, they did a wonderful job developing the characters at several points, especially the leads, to get you to be able why they were acting the way that they were given the situation. While there were several characters I would've liked to know more about it ultimately didn't make sense given the short episode span and the minor roles they filled.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10): As mentioned, an original story with some good characters, an awesome soundtrack and some half decent art.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend to watch this if you are a fan of action or slice of life animes as it touches up on both genres very well.",

The main character is pretty bland, though he does have a somewhat interesting backstory he has little to no personality or motivation, the same for his love interest the \"Angel\", basically a Rei Ayanami clone for 11 episodes just to show a little of development in the last episode, which would be fineif they were given a more supportive role in the series, unfortunally they were given too much focus through the series small number of episodes and it felt flat. So much potential, I really hope someday they try to do this again but this time give it 25 episodes or more.",

It's just too amazing!\r\nSound 10/10\r\nThe voice actors of this anime are very well-selected. I have no complaints about the voice acting. The BGM also fits the scenes very well, especially the last scene, The opening and ending song are just fabulous. I enjoyed myself listening to them.\r\nCharacters 8/10\r\nThe characters in this anime are very well-developed, especially Kanade andYuzuru. I love these two! The backstories of the characters were all very unique and interesting, Although there are many characters which didn't show their backstories, but I have no complaints.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed myself watching this anime.\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nSo I just recommend you watching this anime. Just watch it! You won't regret! \\n",

            "content": "Sometimes it's the small things that mark us the most. Angel Beats is one hell of an anime and, with 13 episodes only, it has been able to move me in a way only a few are capable to.\r\nThe episodes are supposed to be viewed all at once, which is not an hard thing to do once it's totally addicting. But everything's got its downsides and this particular anime is no exception. After completeing this adventure, the viewer is very likely to be full of doughts and simply demanding explanation. Maybe if this was an anime with more than just 13 episodes it could havehad time to explain things a little better. But one does not simply focus only on these aspects as the story was also very unique, everything but predictable. Summarising, I give the story a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nWhen starting to watch Angel Beats! it's highly likely that the viewer isn't able to distinguish some of the characters as they are a bit of similar. But just after about 2 episodes the characters start developping, not only in aspect but also in personality, matching each other perfectly. The scenario is very simple. However, it is indeed breathtaking in the most critical parts. Due to all this, I give the art 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nI personally consider the sound category one of the most important. Angel Beats! nailed it. Opening song, credits song and the songs sang by the characters truely rock. As I write this review I am listening to the anime's soundtrack! But more important than this, the ones that played when the viewer felt different emotions, enhancing every single scene, especially the saddest ones. As to the voice actors, they were great, despite the fact that the lines weren't that hard. I give the sound 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime were outstanding! Totally different from eachother, every single one admirable and shined in their way. If only there were more episodes to explore everyone's story/background! I will never forget any of them. The relationships developed between these are awesome. Nothing more to say, only that I give 10/10 to the character.\\n\\n\r\nOf course such an amazing anime couldn't be garbage. I loved it and enjoyed it a lot! Non-anime fans will love it too, I'm sure. This was the first anime I ever watched and I had a wrong point of view about animes in general. This one had the strenght to \"convert\" me. I shall always remember it and I'd absolutely love to rewatch it, even though I still haven't. Worth owning.That being said I give the enjoyment 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nAnd once the average of the points I gave is equal to 9.6, I give the Overall 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nIf you think this review wasn't helpful please let me know in the comments what I could improve.",

            "content": "\"Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door\"!!! \r\n-One of my favorite songs, and one that for me, got a new meaning in Angel Beats!, one of the best and most symbolic/dramatic amines I have seen so far this year, and I have seen alot of them by now.\r\n-First let me tell you that as most of you, when I first discovered this anime, I had a concept of what it was (sci-fi with girls, guns and dramatic scenes) and surprisingly, I was wrong at some aspects of it, as I never had read the description of the anime. \r\n-The concept for this series is original, rebellionagainst \"God\" on an Afterlife Battlefield (a limbo you may say), and in the center of the rebellion we have the people that died without fulfilling their lives or/and having lived unfair lives, all in the end died! Despite of everyone that takes part of this rebellion being already dead, they still fight, they fight against being erased, they want to live on this Afterlife and they don\u2019t want to be reincarnated to a new life, due to the unfairness of their previous lives, this makes them collide and fight against Tenshi, the president of the student council of the high school that they \"attend\", that is basically where this Afterlife-limbo is located.\\n\\n\r\n-The anime is a mix of action scenes, drama, physophy of life, with comedy and seldom some romantic scenes. It is all very well crafted together, the balance between action, drama and comedy is \"set on the right spot\" and I never thought that a scene needed more of this, or more of that. I was even surprised for the quality of the comedy on this anime!!\\n\\n\r\n- The story was well told with some surprises left for the watchers to discover, itself this story is full of meanings and hidden truths and teaches of the value of life, and of \"the unfairness\" of it, after all not everyone gets to get his happy ending, dying surrounded by their closest ones, and on death we are all alone... let\u2019s just say, it will make you cry at some parts, and laugh at others, while it will make you debate and think about the concepts that the anime lives on.\\n\\n\r\n-The art of the anime is outstanding, and being this something that partially makes me enjoy anime so much, it made the anime flow very well, thus the emotions it meant to create on us, were wonderfully expressed!!\\n\\n\r\n-The sound at first was a bit odd, I didn\u2019t know a thing about this anime, and so I didn\u2019t understood the OP at first, but after the first episode, it gets to you, and for me I never skipped the Opening and the Ending, the Ending maxed out the emotions that I felt through each of the episodes, and there is even some nicely done songs that are song in the episodes not counting the EP and the END, so on this category it won\u2019t disappoint, it will fuse very well with what the anime is about and the struggles the characters face and have faced through their previous lives.\\n\\n\r\n-The characters are one of the strongest aspects of Angel Beats! thought at first you don\u2019t care about the main protagonist, Otonashi Yuzuru, he will develop more and more, and (little spoiler) when I saw his previous death, I burst into tears\u2026 , as for the other characters, I didn\u2019t found anyone boring, everyone of the \"main gang\" has a unique trait to them, either T.K. with his dialogue, the hacker likes to be called Christ, Yui is very cheerful, and Yuri... I really liked her character, and Tenshi whose name is Kanade (means tune, soft song), you will get to know her better too, for good or for bad I won\u2019t say! Another enjoyable character is the only thing I can say about Kanade, since I don\u2019t want to spoil too much about it, and I forget about the \"macho\" who likes to take of his shirt to show us his build... just LOOL!! It is very funny trust me, you think he may be smart with his appearance and then this\u2026 Conclusion with such high grade of quality of characters, like this, you will spend alot of happy and sad moments...\\n\\n\r\n-The enjoyment, I finished the anime 3 hours ago, saw the OVA (won\u2019t discuss here, it is just very funny to watch :) )... I WANT TO GO ON AND REWATCH THIS!! I have saw lots of animes by now, and of all of those, this had some of the best moments to it! It makes you care for the characters, for how they died, for their previous hardships, you just want them to be happy to have fun, to have a new opportunity in life, to feel accomplished for what they had done on their lifes and rest in peace, because they deserved it!\\n\\n\r\n-Overall if you want a great anime, that is diverse, unique, with great sounds, animation, characters and give lots of emotional moments (by happier or sadder), I can\u2019t see where you could go wrong with this, one of my favorite amines of all time!! The only bad thing, it is that it only has 13 episodes (not counting the OVA)...\\n\\n\r\n(I would be FREAK IN happy if the author done a After Story of this, after all his previous After Story (Clannad\u2019s) was something\u2026else)\\n\\n\r\nIf you embark on this journey: \\n\r\n It is a journey of reflection through life and the so called Afterlife, redemption and of salvation, self-knowledge and acceptation of yourself, of past mistakes and new begins, a journey that I lived with my heart, it felt heartbreaking on various scenes! And like a \"soft tune, a melody\" it all ended, and I just wanted more and more!! My heart beat\u201ded\u201d to this rhythm of awesomeness, I hope yours to be the same, to the beat of the angel! \\n\r\nAngel Beats! came and left, and the impact was something that I m proud to call: REAL ART!! \\n",

In the beginning it seems like every other anime you've seen, then takes a deep, emotional, turn after the first character accepts fate. The only things I felt weren't needed was the \"random conflict\" (don't want to ruin it for people) in the last couple of episodes, I felt they could have incorporated something that was already there, even though the \"random conflict\" was understandable when explained. Everyone should watch this.  \r\nThere's a statistic that say 7 out of 10 people who watched Angel Beatscried at the end....which one were you lol.",

            "content": "To start off, 'Angel Beats' is an anime that most people will love.The reasons are varying.It is cute and has an original storyline that makes you think long after you finish watching.Plus, it mingles many aspects like action,drama etc. while successfully giving it a lovely depth and meaning.The idea of a world where laws of nature are distorted is intriguing\r\nThe protagonist,Yuzuru Otonashi,seems a bit of a loser at first but the good character development covers off more than enough for it.After hearing about his past life history and how he sacrificed himself even at the moment of death,the perception of him changes entirely.Overall,character developments arepretty good.\\n\r\nAnother similarly nice character lies in the Battlefront leader,Yuri.There are some others who stand out too.The description of their sufferings in life has contributed to the depth of the series to a great extent.It manages to make one emotional.\\n\\n\r\nThe real beauty lies in the unique story line.The basic theme of the afterlife which it tries to portray by narrating the saga of unsatisfied souls is nicely executed.There's also an element of mystery too which makes it better.The idea that those who suffered terribly and instead of their hard work,did not get the least out of their life, get to have a second chance to be happy and attain salvation after death is inspiring.\\n\\n\r\nThe good thing is it doesn't turn out to be a drag because of the serious content but the tons of battle sequences and fully-excited-to-reach-their-goals teenagers makes the journey fun.There are also some cute moments and touching ones like when the 2nd generation diversion team's vocalist,Yui,finally gets to realize her ultimate dream when Hinata proposes to her and makes her feel special.Otonashi's resolve and decisive ability is applaudable and fitting for a hero.Not disheartened by his loved one's death,taking the courage to help others in the world is inspiring.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing is the awesome twist in the story that's revealed at the end.I won't reveal it as it would be a spoiler but the secret of Angel is touching and you'll come to realize the deep connection that existed between Angel and Otonashi for the entire time.The way they reunite after salvation is beautiful and fills one with the hope that the world might be a better place than imagined.Its then, at the very ending moment,that you come to realize why the anime has been named 'Angel BEATS' and it truly feels great at that moment.\\n\\n\r\nBesides these,there are many slight comical scenes which will have one in giggles.But these could have been far better.\\n\r\nAnother slight drawback is Angel's character.In order to build up the story and mould her as per its requirements,she does not do enough justice to important position of her character.In the end you end up wanting to see more of her other sides than the good fighter one alone.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is pretty decent and good enough for giving support to the story.\\n\r\nThe opening song, 'My soul,your Beats' is magical and though not great makes one love it after they realize Angel's history at the end of the series.It is a good thing that the song connects deeply with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall,the anime is definitely worth a watch as it manages to deliver in many aspects.It can be interpreted in many ways.One can take it as a fun,action-packed watch while another may describe it based on its depth and feels.In conclusion,if you are searching for a nice anime to watch and stumbled upon this review,just feel sure and give this one a try.It doesn't take up too much time due to the few episodes that are there and definitely manages to pack a punch in such a short series.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Angel Beats! another dramatic and \"sad\" anime! Other people find this genre of anime quite idiotic to watch, but personally I find sad anime the best genre of anime that I could ever find! The great thing about Angel Beats isn't that it's very emotional, it's that they were able to mix in supernatural elements, action and even comedy. There were hilarious moments that really brightened the mood in the beginning of the series, near the end of the series is when the anime took a turn to being happy to sad, to be expected since this anime was created by Jun Maeda, the founderof the company \"Key\" which produced many successful anime such as Air, Kanon and even the Legendary Clannad : After Story. If you're interested in experiencing feels like never before, and even be cheered up and happy, laughing your ass off than this anime is the one for you. WARNING : If you're watching this around other people, I highly recommend watching this in privacy unless you're fine with other people seeing you cry like a baby, also if you find many things sad, you should probably prepare in advanced for what you are about to watch.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nComponents:\\n\\n\r\nStory : 8.5\\n\\n\r\nI especially enjoyed the story in Angel Beats! The story is about young teenagers that are fighting against \"God\" in the after-life, attempting not to disappear from the world. They do this because most of them have experienced unfair lives that were either ended too quickly or ended with regrets, or taken away from them. People that wanted to experience life to the fullest but weren't able to fulfill their dreams when they were alive, and wanted to get that freedom back. To me, this story was very meaningful and compared to other stories, Angel Beats has a very well developed story and actually has a story to follow.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9.5\\n\\n\r\nI'm also incredibly impressed with the art in Angel Beats! Very colorful and detailed, pleasant to look and the scenery looked quite pretty. Their were always detail of the facial expressions on characters, such as when they were laughing or when they were crying, it seemed convincing enough to believe that they were actually doing that. Unlike few anime which it simply looks like their opening their mouths and closing them repeatedly. Overall, the art is very pleasing to the eye and you can tell they really took their time drawing. \\n\\n\r\nSound : 9\\n\\n\r\nEven though there's only one opening for all the 13 episodes, it's one of my favorite openings and is very catchy. The soundtrack is always one of the main components in a emotional scene, and Angel Beats did more than a good job on conveying emotions through a scene using the soundtrack to provide more of an impact from the emotional scenes., the ending song in Angel Beats is simply amazing and other OST's such as Ichiban no Takaramono which made certain scenes more than sad. At the end of the series, when they played the ending song it made you really think back at everything you just watched, and made every thing more sad after realizing that it ended. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development : 8.5\\n\\n\r\nMost characters in Angel Beats! showed some interested back-story about how their lives in the living world were like, and all of their stories were interesting and you end up feeling really bad about how some of them ended up dying and passing onto the afterlife. I can't really talk much about their back-stories because I'd rather not spoil important information. They did an excellent job on showing what happened to them before, they were very realistic and dark, revealing the true cruel reality of this world. Each character have their own individual appearances and personalities, you can really tell that each character are their own person that don't share too many personalities with one another, making it much easier to getting attached to certain characters. There are a few problems that make the score on the Character Development lower, such as how a few characters didn't get enough air time and at times were ignored, some back stories of the supporting characters were left unexplained and treated as if they were unimportant. The characters that they focused on certainly made the character development part very well done. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10\\n\\n\r\nEven though Angel Beats is very well known for being dramatic and incredibly emotional, there are other aspects of this anime that make you enjoy it even more. This anime was entertaining to watch, and even hilarious! I remember watching Episode 5 ( I believe ) at around 3:00am and I got in trouble for laughing like someone high off crack watching nyan cat for an hour straight, other episodes are especially funny and watching comedic scenes really get you going when watching anime, making you look forward to every episode and eventually once you get near to the last few episodes, you should get ready for a trip of feels. You'd think that anime or any show aired on television would be able of affecting you at all but Angel Beats! changes that, turning from an emotionless brick into a whimpering baby is very possible when watching this anime. I experienced emotions such as being sad from watching this show, never thinking that anime could have such an impact on me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9.3\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats! is definitely one of my favorite anime. Angel Beats! definitely reaches on the top 3 saddest anime on my list. Clannad, Anohana : The Flower We Saw That Day and Angel Beats! These series are more than amazing and even if you think you don't find things sad, and have a dark, cold sense of humor like I do this anime won't fail to impress you and make you experience an endless roller coaster of feels.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Angel Beasts... Probably one of the first shows I've ever watched on this website by recommendation. A great experience to be sure. A fun one. A memorable one. But there are a few flaws that come from the experience that really put me off ever wanting to watch it again. Don't get me wrong, that's not to say you should not watch it. Watch it. If the rating and popularity of it on this site was not enough of a testament to the polish of this show then hopefully I can shed some light, but also know that my complaint(s) do not carry as muchweight in my mind as the compliments that I will very much struggle to run out of.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, with that said, what's so good about it? Why is it worth, to some people, 10/10 points... besides a skewed rating system (7/10 is NOT average you fucking bum). Well, simply put, the comedy is class. Very well executed, visualized and acted, a success for all divisions of the team who put this together. I genuinely haven't laughed out loud at many shows before but this one made it happen multiple times. You might share the stigma that Japanese humor, especially in a school environment, can be quite (controversially) sexual. Cringe humor, Sexual tension and exposing boys to boobs appear to be the go-to \"knock-knock\" jokes in the dismal world of anime comedy... I mean, that and \"funny\" faces. I'm not saying that this kind of humor doesn't have its place in television, but plenty of shows seem to be contempt with that being the ONLY form of comedy and I genuinely could not consider anything other than the antithesis of comedy when executed so poorly. Well, you'd be happy to know that this is nowhere near the case with Angel Beasts, yay! The comedy in this show is traditional slapstick. Three Stooges style; and despite comparing it to a group that started in the 1920's, it's actually rather refreshing. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is, of course until we get to about episode 6 or 7 when the entire show decides that it wants to take itself a bit more seriously. I don't mind a serious story, nor would I have minded if the serious story was set along-side the comedy, but we seem to just switch them out. From this point onwards we seem to face some rather morbid topics, including death, regret, and loss, instead of the previously ridiculous overcomplicated plans and entertaining banter. It seems like such a contradiction to the \"us against them\" merry band of marching muppets that we're introduced to and... maybe that's the point? This shift in tone was always lingering, being carried by the 'new guy', Yuzuru Otonashi, who never really gets with the \"muppet\" mentality and instead opts to drag everybody else out of this \"comedic wonderland\" and right into this morbid reality that they all seemed to have casually avoided. I am genuinely conflicted as to whether I can say that this shift is good because I feel like everything in this paragraph is more of an excuse than an explanation for it. I shouldn't hate this shift in the mood because its somewhat symbolic to what the 'new guy' is trying to do, but at the same time It could just be an emulation/attempt to copy the way Gintama does things, where they have a designated \"comedy\" period and a designated \"serious\" period. If the latter is true then I can't agree with it, because when you only have 13 episodes to work with you cannot execute such a dramatic change in the story's tone nearly as well (In the case of Gintama, it's not even a story thing, its just a new arc that changes by the whim of the writer).\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, It's very much worth emphasizing that I DO NOT think the second half of this show is at all bad. It's just out of place (possibly a consequence of pacing or communication). If you expect the transition, then you won't have a problem, you will very much enjoy what the rest of the show has to offer as it explores some very deep and character-specific issues that, curiously, are actually quite moving. One benefit to the slapstick chapters of this show is that it does wonders for getting you familiar with the characters and their personalities (which are awesome too by the way), now that I think of it, it almost butters you up for the more emotional parts of the show (which there are a few of). The conclusion didn't strike home as much as I thought it would. Despite the perspective of the characters, It's actually quite a happy ending. Well... Grey-happy, it really depends on your perspective, which one can appreciate as its quite hard to make that the case when writing. To really say all that much about it would be to spoil it, or parts of it, and I think this show is best experienced from the most vanilla perspective possible. Which I think is ultimately why I won't watch it again, because while I enjoyed it, I'll never enjoy it as much as I did the first time, I suppose they call that \"re-watch potential\", which makes for the second, and final, shortcoming that I could find.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThat about wraps it up for my opinion. Do give it a watch if you haven't already, this show is #8 in popularity for a reason, and everyone has something to say about it (you may even recognize one or two early 2010 era memes in there).\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "*~SPOILER FREE REVIEW~*\r\nDisclaimer: This is my first review, so if you have any constructive criticism I would appreciate it if you PM me any suggestions for improvement.  \r\nAngel Beats! is a global phenomenon and has extremely widespread acclaim among anime fans and critics alike but virtually no criticism.  I came in with high expectations only to be disappointed with the events that have unfolded in front of me.  Even with Sword Art Online or One Punch Man (put down your pitchforks), other anime that I dislike, I can at least respect them because there are aspects in both that Ican see appeal to audiences that I am not a part of.  Angel Beats! is a different case, I don\u2019t have ill intention of saying this, but I cannot see what makes Angel Beats! so appealing to anybody let alone a large portion of the anime community.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory (2):  Angel Beats! is a school anime featuring teens who have died and are in some sort of afterlife.  The setting is a tad weird, but let\u2019s roll with it.  Because they are already dead the many fight scenes that occur on occasion do not have any sort of risk or danger; to further drive this point home our archetypal main character (more on him later) is killed 100 times in the very first episode.  The supposed antagonist that is presented at the beginning of the story is established to be immortal, but our heroes keep shooting her anyway, it\u2019s pointless and leads to even more pointless fights.  \\n\\n\r\nConsequently, the story is character driven and relies on the audience\u2019s emotional ties. However, Angel Beats! fails at giving it\u2019s characters any depth and relies on cliche backstories in an attempt to produce some sort of emotion.  Many of Angel Beats!\u2019 defenders state that its lack of budget and one cour run is to be blamed for rather than Maeda\u2019s writing, this is not the case.  Angel Beats!, despite its relatively short length gives priority to meaningless filler (baseball anyone?) rather than time to fulfill its purpose of giving its audience characters to empathize with.       \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in Angel Beats! feels forced and it feels like the show would be a lot better without it, I would argue that this would be a great anime if it took out the filler and comedy and replaced it with time to develop the plot and the characters.  The comedy, to put it succinctly, can be described as Nichijou-esque hamfisted slapstick without the charm that Nichijou had, people screaming at each other, TK\u2019s English (although this may be not be intended as humor), and \u201cso random LOL xdxd\u201d humor.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art (5): The animation is nothing of note.  The art style is actually decent and it does have its moments.  The design of the characters is generic, this is especially obvious with the design of Otonashi.  Laziness is shown with the reuse of background characters multiple times even within the same frame.  The art is probably the greatest part of Angel Beats! but that isn\u2019t enough to make it worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nSound (3):  Let\u2019s start with a positive, the opening of Angel Beats is great on the ear and honestly memorable for an opening.  The songs by the in-universe band \u201cGirl\u2019s Dead Monster\u201d are repetitive and generic, their songs are an obvious cash-grab to bank on the success of K-on and Haruhi Suzumiya\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (1): Only a few members of the large cast of Angel Beats! are attempted to be developed.  Literally every character is either forgettable or archetypal, none of the characters really had any defining traits that made them stand out other than some manipulative sob story.\\n\\n\r\nOur main character, Otonashi, is the very definition of a bland shounen protagonist.  He has virtually zero character other than the little information we get from his backstory.  He\u2019s more of a self-insert character than anything else due to him learning the ins-and-outs the same time as the viewer.  \\n\\n\r\nYurippe, is who should have been the antagonist.  She is the leader of the squadron that goes by the name SSS over the course of the series. She bullies the members of her squad to fulfill her desires and forces them to get bad grades. She even has underground slave labor to make (useless) weapons for her.\\n\\n\r\nTenshi has no character other than looking cute, but that\u2019s usually enough to win the attention of the anime community.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are just there, a portion of them get backstories in to try to make up for the lack of character that they have.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (1): Contrary to Angel Beats!\u2019 intentions the only emotions I felt were boredom and anger.  I did not enjoy this anime at all and I really wish that wasn\u2019t the case. In fact, the people who I know in real life do enjoy the characters, the humor, etc. and if that\u2019s the case then that\u2019s great!  But I do not share the same feelings and found Angel Beats! a case of masquerading as something that it isn\u2019t, an emotional drama.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (2):  Angel Beats! has a rushed and incoherent plot that was designed to make as much money as possible, cringeworthy comedy that detracts from the intended atmosphere due to terrible pacing, mediocre music, and atrocious characters that make the Sword Art Online characters feel realistic.  Angel Beats! has been described as the pinnacle of emotive drama anime and if that statement is true then I\u2019m afraid that this genre is not one for me.\\n\\n\\n",

There is a lot of negatives and positives you can say with this show.\r\nPros:\r\nThis show is a real tear-jerker, but unfortunately, I didn't really cry... I can see why many other people did and I'm a bit surprised I didn't shed a tear, but these scenes are extremely emotional and are accompanied by amazing music.\r\nThe art is beautiful. I love this style, but it's really not for everyone. Personally, I love how every background looks.\r\nThe story is good enough. It's interesting and really keeps you watching, although there are very noticeable plot holes.\r\nAngelBeat's sense of humor is hilarious in many parts, but it also knows when to get serious.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending scene is beautiful. I don't want to spoil it, but trust me. Watch to the end of the credits in the last episode (not the OVAs.)\\n\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\nSome of the characters look like re-skins that change only the hair and eye colors.\\n\\n\r\nMany characters aren't developed enough for us to care about them.

            "content": "Angel Beats. Is there anything that\u2019s not lovable about this anime?\r\nOk, yes, there are some flaws with the series, just like any good production. Nothing can ever be perfect. But Angel Beats is the closest a story can get to being perfect.\r\nImagine you\u2019ve died. It doesn\u2019t matter how, but you\u2019ve just died and now find yourself in a strange world. Now, imagine that world was filled with people just like you, all fighting against \u201cGod\u201d. This is the basis the story goes on. Otonashi is the newest member of the SSS, the league of those whose will is to fight against God due to theirshitty circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Angel Beats is one to be praised. It sets up Angel as the enemy in the midst of all these SSS students while letting her mysterious side stay. This mysteriousness gnaws at Otonashi as he attempts to unravel the truth of everything. \\n\\n\r\nIt flows smoothly in between scenes and never feels out of place in the setting. The transitions between comedic and serious scenes don\u2019t make it awkward like many stories. You usually can\u2019t tell that it\u2019s transitioning, yet it is. Just like the smooth transitions, the pacing is flawless. Nothing ever feels too rushed or too slow. This series will leave you wanting to watch just that one extra episode before you get on with your life. There is nothing imperfect about the story itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are where it falls just a little short. Since this anime is only 13 episodes long and includes at least 20 characters, each with their own personality and traits, some of them are left ignored, unexplained or simply vanish at times. Simply put, there are too many of them to cover. However, the ones that are covered and given background are done so in great detail with such a short amount of time. Characters like Yurippe, Otonashi, Iawsawa, Hinata, Yui, Angel, and a few others will leave viewers feeling satisfied with well developed characters.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a beautifully animated series, and the music goes along with the setting perfectly. The intro as well as the outro will leave the viewer stunned due to the effort put into it. The piano goes along nicely with the feelings and art. Not to mention, Girls Dead Monster is a real band that has all the tracks heard in the anime plus more. Highly recommended. Not much else can be said besides how amazing it will make anybody feel.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum this up, this is definitely an anime worth checking out. Jun Maeda really outdid himself with this one. This is an anime that\u2019s hard not to love for many people out there. While it isn\u2019t the perfect story, it will leave anyone with a feeling of regret for not watching it sooner, and is guaranteed to give you 13 episodes of pure entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr: If you\u2019re looking for a short but gripping adventure, this is the anime for you. Minus a lack of total character development this anime is near perfect.\\n",

            "content": "I feel weird about Angel Beats. I don't want to answer it yet. First i'm gonna list what ilke and what i dislike and at the bottom I will answer.\r\nFirst off: What I don't like.\r\nThe characters are inconsistent, atleast I think. They have their way to act and express themself and during the show it changes. That's nothing bad, but I never got the reason why they changed. Of course, they always change after a big event but it still doesn't make sense why they swapped their character. It left me confused and the characters seemd like aliens to me. I had a hard timeto feel along with a lot of the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nMy other problem was the setting. Don't know why. It's just this casual school, than these kids who run with snipers and pistols around, a mine in the underground of the school? And none of the characters was confused. Atleast the the protagonist should be, after the lore of the story. But also acts completltly normal in this uncanny world. That made the cast more alien than they already are.\\n\\n\r\nAlso a problem for me was the main character Otonashi. He seemed to be very average and his only special trait appeard to be his kindness. But his kindness was boring. Through that he looked like a wish-fullfilment fantasy of th writer/viewer. And these are boring characters for me. But atleast the backstory he got was good. Unfortunatly this doesn't had a big effect on his overall character.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I hated the color design. The hair was a explosion of color but the uniforms where these soft pastel colors. And one character is really pale, has white hair and yellow eyes. It looks like snow where someone pissed in. Pale white and yellow are a bad combo. Except you're a fried egg.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow what i like:\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the characters often appear to be alien for me, the tear heavy moments still got me. Mainly episode 12 & 10. Episode 10 especially. Man, this was sad. And it surprised. Most of the critic I had already build up in the beginning of show. And the it shot episode 10 at me and I bursted out in tears. I would have never thought that the still could hit me so hard after all the problem I had gathered towards the series.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the comedy is pretty good. With the premise that nobody can die they have build up some grotesque moments which brought me to laugh a whole lot.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the series did something I'm a absolute sucker for: Adjustable Openings & Endings. I hate it when a Opening/Ending portraits one state of the story, the something changes in the story but the Opening/Ending still shows the old state. But Angle Beats adjusted it. They didn't swapped the intro, they just adjusted, changed a litte. This has either lead to some awesome moments or more tear heavy  moments. And I like such things very, very, VERY much. Thank you, Angel Beats.\\n\\n\r\nGosh, this review is  too long.\\n\\n\r\nAllright, I said I will now talk a little bit about the reason why I feel weird about Angel Beats. When I first watched Angel Beats I didn't know why. But some time atfer that I watched a video about anime-tone-shifts. A tone-shift is when a anime (or other mediums) is happy-go-lucky in one scene/episode but in the following suddenly a heavy drama or a heavy moment which leaves scars in your heart. Like in bollywood films. And a point of this video was that  alot of western audiences (including me) aren't used to these shifts and tend to have negative opinion about. I think this is exactly my case. You saw how highly I spoke of it sometimes despite the number of problems I had with the show. I'm just not accustomed to these tone-shifts. And that's why I feel weird about it.\\n\\n\r\nI think the conclusion is obvious: Can you like such tone-shifts? Angel Beats can be something for you. You don't like them? Maybe for the look out for something else.\\n\\n",

I know the answer now, but I feel like the anime dragged on long enough without giving theviewer this answer. The consequence of this delay was that I felt all the operations that Yuri planned for the team was just a waste of time since I didn't really know what the end goal was or what the motivation was.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I personally felt like the first few episodes were not very engaging because from an outsider perspective, there's just this crazy girl Yuri who wants to for some reason destroy this other girl Tenshi, and our main character is kinda just caught in between all that.\\n\\n\r\nAside from these issues, I liked many things. The Art was great, not a drawing style you would typically see in anime. In addition, I liked the music, and the storylines of each individual character was very engaging. Learning how each of them came to the afterlife. More of those would be completely welcome in my opinion. None of the characters felt too \"cookie cutter\" either, most of them were unique and you'd never really know what to expect from them.\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats is an anime that for sure I can see why some people enjoy. Personally, I thought it was decent, and I had fun watching it while I did. But I'm not sure if I'd be jumping off the roofs about watching a second season of it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd dangit Yuri never ended up calling that one kid \"Christ\". gdi Yuri why",

Without reading I stepped in and watched it all, in near enough 1 sitting.\r\nI can see where people are coming from, is this the perfect anime? No. It has holes and unanswered questions, but for me (Still an early anime watcher and only just getting into it) I have not found a short 10-14 part series to be that solid. Unless multiple seasons are involved. \r\nWhat it did do however was show me how great an anime can be even when nowherenear perfect. It maybe my life experiences, which is working around death at a coroners/funeral service. As a 24 year old male this had me laughing from one minute, smiling with joy to crying. Let me tell you I have seen my fair share of people I know could be stuck in a place like that.\\n\\n\r\nIt maybe basic with its share of issues. But what it does put out is something beautiful, with incredible music. Great characters even if not fully fleshed out. I feel it is the perfect show to show friends so they can experience what anime can make you feel. It has a bit of everything, and will always have a special place for me.",

            "content": "\"Angel Beats! was almost a masterpiece, in fact, it was very close\"\r\n-> After Kanon, Air and Clannad, you know exactly what to expect from a \"Key\" Visual novel adaptation: outstanding art + great sound, so i'm not going to bother you all talking about how great it is, i just will tell you that this consistency found on \"Key\" adaptations mantains, and now for the important part:\r\n-  \"Afterlife\" shows are full of potential, it allows you to create your own worlds with your own rules and use that as a support to develop the story, a single glance at how different Haibane Renmei (whichi've already watched) and AB! are, yet how they keep exactly the same premise tell us a lot about this potential. In the case of AB! this is shown both in action and comedy, where the \"beyond world\" rules let the character respawn, making deaths something hilarious instead of dramatic, other examples can be found, but that would be spoiler \\n\\n\r\n- We have Otonashi Yuzuru, a guy who finds himself suddenly on this  world (a school) without memories, and joins the Shinda Sekai Sensen [Rebels against the god], a squad which, interestingly enough, doesn't try to find the way to leave, but fight for staying on this world.. Their enemy is Tenshi from the student council, because whoever listens to her and acts properly in the school dissapears.\\n\\n\r\n-> In the SSS members stories, we find a good reason for them to want to fight, and as a well donel \"afterlife\" show, it explores the subjects of god, life purpose (why to stay) and death (or dissapearing). The story later changes with some plot twists and with the correct triggers (some are just perfect) and the mix of characters makes watching this a fun and enjoyable ride.. The ending is unexpected, though\\n\\n\r\n- And why it was just close of being a masterpiece? because of details, or to explain myself better, the lack of them. Some changes in the plot are understandable, but at times the series rushes and changes too fast and what is worse, leaves things unexplained, this hurts the story a lot because at times there just isn't a link between the events and doesn't let you wondering \"How did it happen?\" but more like \"What? something is missing here\"\\n\\n\r\n- The second problem with AB! are the characters, sure, they are mixed, not so predictable and the main ones have really solid backstories, but the problem is secondary ones barely had any, they were treated like NPCs at the end, something i feel is as unfair as they think god was to them at the beginning of the series.. My fav character dies first too, but that's a personal rant \u00ac\u00ac\\n\\n\r\nBottomline, it has it's flaws, but it's a fun, enjoyable ride and something i'd recommend to watch. The funny thing is that maybe if AB! was a bit longer it could have made the pieces fit perfectly and achieve a masterpiece status, or at least that's what i think\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10\\n\r\nArt + Sound 10/10\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\n-> I discovered something interesting, for some reason the review wasn't completely posted, so a lesson for me, always watch how your review was posted..

            "content": "When you die, Where do you go? Angel Beats is a fascinating anime/ manga that's originality is amazing. I wanted a tragedy anime, something that also was funny and ( possibly even ecchi). What I got (without ecchi and now I'm thankful for it) is Angel Beats, although every episode wanted me just wanting 2 minutes or so more just to clarify or go further.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nDying is not the end of the cycle in this anime. The fact and intriguing part that all who have regrets come back into this mysterious world, and let alone don't die and have to complete their tasks, otherwise becomethe zombie AI's. The part of AI was extremely interesting, because the characters must stay \"unique\" this is why I also liked this part.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nI especially love this art, but I couldn't say it wasn't at sometimes unsatisfying. When you start an anime, and build your expectations I cannot give this a ten due to how there are so many  animes who to have great art. Art is now suppose to be great, and is being  raised to higher standards everytime. I believe that art should also be unique, which I have to refer ( Akagi) due to how Art has to play on the anime. Not all animes can just go pretty or \"kawaii\" art. \\n\\n\r\nSounds 10/10\\n\r\n\"Get Chance and Luck\" When I think of the sound it was absolutely superb. The english of T.K, his Japanese also too, but the emotions in the sound. I sincerely love Otonashi's and Kanades moments with the emotion. Kamiya, Hiroshi( Otonashi) is also one of my favorite characters , Orihara Izaya, from Durarara, and then to tag along with Hanazawa, Kana also from Durara as Sonohara, Anri is very nice. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nT.K T.K  It's a moon walk it's a moon walk. Angel Beats characters are perfect for each other. T.K the most funny comic reliever I've ever known talking in english, Otonashi, the emotional unknown person, along with others ( cannot spoil everything). The Characters also tag along with the sound, and this is a great anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI gave enjoyment a 9 due to how as most scenes are enjoying, and fun filled with some action, but some scenes just lack... I cannot express around episode 9-10 where ( Spoiler blah blah blah) this happens and then  it's over. I cried at every moment of the sad things making this to me a sincere dramatic tragedy. Through the anime it felt it got a much more serious tone which I love.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nThrough the ups and downs of Angel Beats, and Yuri's crew I felt like I had become one of them, sharing there moments. From laughing and having an attempt to steal cafeteria tickets and playing concerts to attract the kids, to jumping and killing each other due to being immortal I soon wish I was there sometimes. Even a heartless person, should  have a soul and start to cry at this wonderful masterpiece emotional anime by Key.",

            "content": "Angel Beats is placed in some sort of alternate world for young people. The purgatory area is a highschool. As the viewer, you follow the character Yuzuru Otonashi who randomly finds himself in this odd world. In hopes of figuring out why he and the other people he meets are placed in this world, he joins up with the SSS group (The main group in the story). \r\nOverall, I find the idea very unique and very open for an eventful and entertaining story. When I first started watching Angel Beats, I was unsure if I would like it or not. Knowing that Jun Maeda hadwritten it, I already had high expectations for the show. As i watched and went through all 13 episodes of the series, I really came to love the series. One of the parts of the anime that made me like it and really attracted me towards the show off of the start was the band GirlsDeadMonster (Band made of a few of the SSS members). Their performances really amazed me. Besides having catchy music that I really liked, I found that the art in the scenes were very nicely done. After seeing this, I looked forward to all of their performances. The music that came out of this show was arguably the best music I've heard from an anime yet!! The songs that I've heard from the band were very emotional and performed extremely well. Even though I do love the anime a lot, one problem appeared, the series felt like it was too short.... I could never give it a ten due to the length of the series. Length of a show is something I usually wouldn't make a comment on but I really felt angel beats needed more episodes to be considered a great anime. With only 13 episodes in the series, the story of angel beats moved extremely fast. The show ended up moving too fast. In the end, I felt as if the show was somewhat incomplete to me. The pace at which Angel Beats moved really didn't leave enough room for character development.\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\\n\r\n-Story is unique and interesting. It is very open for an eventful and interesting series. Although I wasn't completely satisfied with the anime, the story itself is a good idea.(Would've liked a different approach to the story though)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\n-I like the art of the series as a whole but, I noticed that the art seemed better when it hit the concert scenes. It would be nice if the animation was as good as the concert scene throughout the whole anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\n-The voice acting was great. The sound effects, background music, and OP/ED were all pretty good and fit with the series very well. This alone would've only got the anime a 9, but the band GirlsDeadMonster gave that extra push that convinced me to give a 10 for sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\n-I found every character to be decently enjoyable to me. My only problem was their was a huge lack of character development. The stories of the characters throughout the series that I did hear about were very touching stories that I really liked, but I couldn't help but feel disappointed in not being able to hear about all the characters and their reasons for being in the purgatory like world Angel Beats was set in.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\n-Angel Beats is a series that is very easy to get into and to like. I sat through every episode with complete enjoyment of the show. Also, I really love the band GirlsDeadMonster! The music that came from GirlsDeadMonster is possibly the best music that I've heard out of an anime. Overall, just a very enjoyable show to watch that left me wanting more!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\n-Angel Beats is a great anime and possibly one of my all time favorite animes. The show was a very enjoyable show for me to watch. As much as I would've wanted it to be one of those masterpiece caliber shows (and it really could've been one of those shows), it really wasn't in the end. It had a great story, nice art, great sound (GirlsDeMo!! XD) and likable characters, it was missing the necessary character development that I would've liked to see. Therefore, a 9 is a suitable rating for an anime that was so close to being perfect in my book.\\n\\n\r\n*Something else I have to add in is more emphasis on the importance of the band GirlsDeadMonster that influenced my decision on giving it such a high score. If it weren't for the band, I most likely would've given this show between a 6 and 8. Although the anime itself is flawed (Too short which caused lack of character development, different approach on the story would've been better, not giving the best quality of art possible the whole time) this band gave me something that most anime's haven't done for me. When watching this anime, the music that I have gained due to this show are some of the best songs I've heard period. I've gained more than just enjoyment while watching the show, I've gained songs that I can listen to longer than any anime that I will ever watch. Animes that I watch come and go every year but something that I hold onto and cherish forever are songs.",

Angel Beets houses one of my deepest hatreds for any anime, along with Heroman, mostly because of how disappointed I was throughout the whole show. \r\nStory \r\nUm, story. \"People die when they are killed.\"-Shirou Emiya. Truer words have never been spoken, and Angel Beets likes to portray that a lot.We follow a group of kids who have, thats right you guessed have died, and are now in purgatory, though I like to think its hell, trying to fight a loli. Why? Well because the kids don't want to move on,because that would be silly.Throughout the shows run we explore the back story of all the characters learning about how they died while most people find them to be super sad, I did not  as for why, I do not know the characters well enough, because they weren't developed and I didn't have enough screen time for me to care about them , the writing was full of plot holes and to the end I felt that they weren't even trying anymore. In the end stuff happens I laughed. Didn't tell a well put together story, \"super sad times\" were forced as the PETA \"In the Arms of an Angel\" campaign. Too many plot holes, copy and paste characters, and a bad director. Some people tell that Angel Beets was supposed to 25-26 episodes long well if it was then maybe they could have had a better story, characters with more screen time and  were explored more to make me actually feel for and like the characters during their \"super sad times\", and that is why Seiji Kishi is a bad director\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nHope you guys enjoy seeing Kyon and Haruhi go on another crazy adventure with the SOS brigade,  the main characters are in Angel Beets are very obvious copy and paste characters from Haruhi Suzumiya. After seeing everyone's background and hearing them speak more than two sentences of dialogue I began to despise everyone with one exception, the best character obviously was J.T. the shining ray of hope for me as I watched this anime because he had barely any dialogue and no back story so I had no reason to hate him. \\n\\n\r\nMusic.\\n\r\nActually pretty good music.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation- \\n\r\nUm really not a expert so I don't think I should say anything, I guess its pretty OK or good not really sure. They do copy and paste a lot of background characters especially during the concert scenes, either Angel Beets animators got really lazy or a lot twins died at the same time and then refused to move on, I like to believe the latter is the correct answer.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\r\nThis a great comedy anime recommend to all your friends, its the bees knees. Angel Beets everyone.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\r\nOverall its pretty funny, in a sad way. There is more holes in Angel Beets  especially that ending, than Edward Scissor Hand's condoms. Musics pretty good, characters are copy and paste.\\n\\n\r\n If you think I am a piece of feces or just want to have a nice discussion please message me. \\n\\n\r\nFor shows that I think  actually had more feeling than Angels Beets that were not forced and devolped throughout the show,see the classic \"Gay N*ggers from Outer Space\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ncwCETyQlk, or Pet Girl of Sakurasou, and Anohana, or just watch Haruhi Suzumiya for the characters since Angel Beets likes them too.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review so please tell me how to improve and how your opinion is better than mine.",

            "content": "I had always wondered what would happen when I die. Would I just fade to nothingness, burn in a pit of eternal fire, be reborn as a pigeon and get to crap all over people\u2019s cars, or simply be sent back to high school. Right..\r\nOur main character wakes up with no memories and soon finds out that he has died, and that he is doomed to live out his afterlife in high school... Great. Because in this afterlife, if you study your little butt off and survive the onslaught of midterms, finals and placement tests, you get to be reborn as a seaslug, yay! (sarcasm).He soon joins a group of students called the SOS brigade, I mean, the SSS brigade, where together they rebel against the absolute god for having dealt them a short and unjust life. How exactly do they rebel against this god? By not going to class. Apparently God is the principal and the Devil is played by my 10th grade history teacher.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to get a feel for what this anime is like. Just imagine high school, but with guns; where you skip class, steal people's lunches, and butt heads with the student body president. . . so just high school in general. \\n\r\nThis premise sounds pretty ridiculous yeah, but that is the tone set by the anime. Being set in the afterlife, no one actually dies because they are all already dead, and anything else is simply overkill. They can get halved, impaled, drowned, wasted, plastered, and hammered, only to wake up the next hour with nothing more than a bad hangover.\\n\r\nTheir methods of rebelling against god range from; trying to get miss student body president to fail all her placement tests, trying to win in a game of baseball, or just running around like a bunch of hyperactive retards.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all this anime is a good laugh. If you\u2019re looking for an anime that doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously then give it a go. There is good humor spread throughout, a nice handful of actions scenes, and devious plots to \u2018stick it to the man\u2019. That is.. for the first half of the show. \\n\r\nThe second half takes a more serious undertone which brings back to perspective that, high school is a load of B.S., and that they are all stuck in the afterlife. From there things start to progress in the show and you get to realizing that, \u201cShit Just Got Serious\u201d. Soon you'll find what \"had you laughing aloud earlier\" now leaving you in tears. \\n\\n\r\nHere comes the gripes I had watching this show. First off, high school was NEVER that friendly for me. In here, enemies become friends and frienemies become BFF\u2018s. I got dropkicked for trying to shake hands with a senior. >.>\u2018\\n\r\n  The latter half of the anime felt a little rushed to me, with the mood of the anime doing a 180, and the final villain coming out of seemingly nowhere. It\u2019s like the producers randomly pulled a character out of their asses and threw it at us. I don\u2019t even think they bothered to give him a proper name.\\n\r\n  I do think the anime ended a little too early. It had the possibility to go on for quite a bit, with the SSS brigade constantly sprouting half baked idiotic ideas on how to dick around, and the student body president coming to the realization that, she was dealing with a bunch of retards. \\n\r\nI\u2019m not saying I was dissatisfied with the ending, I just thought it was a bit abrupt.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime? Yes. \\n\r\nI had a great time watching it. And the ending, albeit a bit abrupt, was very well done. The animation is beautiful, as is the music. So go on, check it out, if you haven\u2018t already, and tell me what you think.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed this review, and as always, thank you for reading.",

Part of this might have been because it didn't meet my basic anime preferences and had a different focus from the genre's I'm used to. Heck I don't even really take to animes with less than 30 episodes. (Excluding  smut-based anime here) \r\nI have never been so surprised, amazed and - to be frank- wrong about an anime. I can recall crying three or four separate times near the end of theseries. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is gut-wrenching and well worth the tears I cried.... The characters are great and they never failed to make me laugh, cry or get all 'serious face' along with them. The story is simple, but not without impact. The build up to the end is phenomenal-- by the time I reached mid-anime I was hooked and couldn't stop watching.  \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend it to anybody.",

            "content": "I've always been a fan of the writer Jun Maeda and honestly I started watching Angel Beats! beacause I liked the name, the art style and the fact that he wrote it. Within the first episode I had fallen in love. \r\nAt first I thought it was just going to be a high action anime, I was so surprised at how heart-wrenching and saddening it became, though I suppose I should expect nothing less of Jun Maeda. After Kanon, Air and Clannad I thought I couldnt possibly be surprised by his works but I certainly wasn't expecting this. Any anime that can make me crywithin 3 episodes must be amazing, and that's exactly what happened and exactly what it is. It's an amusing and a beautiful creation. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I love so much about Angel Beats! is hte story and plot-line. It was creative and really interesting. It was really different to previous works of Jun and I get misty-eyed just thinking about it. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are really impressive, I love the way they mature and grow to accept things about themselves and learn to move on, and when that happens you get so happy inside that you can't help but cry sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nI loved this anime, it's the most amazing one I've ever watched, my favorite by far, and it's going to take something really special to knock it of it's perch.",

            "content": "STORY:\r\nThe story of Angel Beats is definitely unique to say the least, I have never seen another anime with a similar story line. I found the story creative and emotional, it made me feel so much emotion: sadness, happiness, laughter, anger. I believe the story has the correct balance between comedy and sadness. I found myself constantly laughing at the crazy antics of the \"SSS\" before suddenly being bombarded with emotion from hearing the backgrounds of the \"SSS\" members. I believe the story was well told and lovable in the short episode run in had.\r\nART:\r\nThe art in this anime is your typical Key Visual Artsanimation with the insanely large eyes and immense attention to detail; it may take a while for some to get used to this style of art but you will soon find yourself loving it. The art overall is consistently beautiful and detailed. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime was beautifully composed as expected from Key Visual Arts anime, the opening and ending both packed alot of emotion and enjoyment, they were also very catchy. The background music to me was very memorable and I thought it was amazing, to have such fitting and emotional background music is a rarity in alot of anime. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nThe characters were all very well made and rounded, they each had lovable personalities that it was hard to find at least one character you didn't like. One of the things about this anime which I was disappointed in was the fact that I didn't get to see alot of the characters background stories which I wished I could've seen, I would blame this issue on the short run time it was given of 13 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nAs an avid Key Visual Arts anime lover, I really enjoyed this one too. There wasn't a moment I got bored and I ended up watching the anime all in one day. It interested me and willed me to keep watching. I loved how easily the anime could change how I was feeling from fits of laughter to floods of tears.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nOverall I believe Angel beats is an amazing, unique and creative story; it's almost hard to find something bad to pick up on. The art was beautiful, the sound track was amazing, the story was intriguing, the characters were lovable and overall I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend this anime to any anime fan. It is a \"must watch\"!",

            "content": "Angel Beats! (or AB!, as I shall refer to it for the remainder of this review)\r\nI didn't have any idea about what was waiting for me before starting AB!. I had simply read the synopsis a long time ago and that was basically it, that was my knowledge of this show.\r\nI finished it in a very short time, even though I started it during the week (while working/going to Uni/hitting the gym). I think it only took me two or three days to complete it while being very busy.\r\nThis should already tell you a bit of how much I enjoyed it, and also that thisanime is really worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story was quite refreshing, it has many mature themes featured into it without being overly dramatic or cheesy, and what's nice is that those themes are presented naturally, they fit the story perfectly . The way the story is told makes you want to keep watching the show episode after episode with no pause. I really love how they were able to tie so many funny scenes into each episode (I was laughing all the way from the 1st till the last episode), while also being able to deliver a storm of feelings only a minute after said funny scenes. These sad ones WILL make you bawl like a little kid, specially if you have lost important people during your life.\\n\\n\r\nI see some reviewers saying that AB! lacks depth and that ''much more could've been done/explored with it''. I'm not really sure why they think this is the case. AB! Never tried to be that ''deep'' It's goal is to present a nice story that many people can relate to while also making fun of some of the tropes we see in anime these days, and they were able to reach that goal. I don't think there's much more that could be done / fitted in 13 Episodes (admittedly they could've done more if they removed some of the gags, but I think this would have ruined the show).\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I don't give this a 10/10 is because the ending seemed to lose some steam, and also because I understand that not everyone is going to enjoy the constant jokes that appear throughout this show (some of which are repeated over and over *not to the point of exhaustion though), but also because it really isn't perfect to warrant a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is, IMO, the weakest part of the show. While the characters look good, that's just it, they just look good. There's not much that makes them stand out, and you'll soon notice that most of the males follow the same pattern, while only having different hair/eye colors etc. Most of the scenery is decently done, but again, it's mostly the regular school setting.\\n\\n\r\nDo notice that this doesn't mean it's bad or even generic, it's just nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nI do have to say that I put great value into the Art, so take my word with a grain of salt.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are no doubts here, right after the weakest part comes the strongest one. I mean, I don't think I've seen many series that put so much effort into their soundtracks/effects. It's not just music either, the Voice Actors did a great job here. You feel as if they actually care for their characters. I watched the OP every single time, I even replayed it many times just because of how nice it sounds.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the music you'll hear here will just tear your heart apart, they're brilliantly connected to the characters/scenes they represent. Even when you see a character playing an instrument, they're just mindlessly doing so, they look like they are ''doing it for real''. The weakest link of the sound is the ED IMO, it's a nice ending song but not as striking as the others. Still, this isn't enough to bring down the general score.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI have to say it's nice to find a male MC who isn't a total wuss and doesn't act like he's a brat all of the time. If this is the kind of MC you like, you'll probably enjoy watching Otonashi.\\n\\n\r\nWith that being said - Yes, some of the remaining characters are cheesy and cliche. Yes, some of them are one-liners. Yes, that's done on purpose.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't a bad thing, it's a good one, because the way they are used makes sense in pushing the story forward and pulling jokes out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say here, I thoroughly enjoyed AB!. There wasn't a single time where I regretted watching it or where I felt bored.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of anime (why'd you be here if you weren't?), I'd say you pretty much have to watch this one. I can certainly understand if it's not your cup of tea, but please, do yourself a favor and at least try it. If you enjoy it, it'll be something you'll be thinking of for a long time.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't enjoy it much, I highly doubt you'll think it's bad or that you didn't take something positive from it.\\n\\n\r\nAs always, I'd like to thank you for reading and also to apologize for any grammar mistakes, English isn't my native language so mistakes are certain to happen every now and then.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you have as much of a great time with AB! as I had.",

I mean that there are parts when it's just slice of life school and sometimes it's action.

            "content": "Like action? Or romance? What about fantasy? Drama? Comedy? Horror? \r\nEvery person has a unique taste in everything. When it comes to anime, you can choose as you want. The possibilities are almost endless! \r\nAngel Beats has something for almost any taste and genre. It\u2019s filled with action, romance, comedy, drama and more. It has a lot of different characters, the animation is beautiful, the music is brilliant and the story is interesting.\r\nThis series has many strong points. It takes the typical \u00absouls that cannot rest because of their former lives\u00bb and instead of making a series taking place on earth with psychics and such,it\u2019s a story gathering the souls in a single place and following their fight against the universe.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnime that try to include a wide spectre of genres often ends up messy and unfinished. That\u2019s not the case with this one. While showing emotional and sad scenes, it mixes in a lot of comedy in between the heartbreak, this without ruining the moment. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this series is quite detailed and beautiful. The school campus looks good and the scenery is close to flawless. The character designs are wide and different for every character. It doesn\u2019t rely on sex-appeal or moe characters, which is refreshing. The amount of detail put in the weapons and instruments is impressive. If you\u2019re knowledgeable with these kind of things, you can clearly see what model, brand and such the different items are. The violence is dramatic, but not \u00abgory\u00bb or noticeably special. \\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes does not disappoint as well. It gets your blood pumping, and that\u2019s all it takes for a viewer to want to see more.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe series has it\u2019s own band called \u00abGirls Dead Monster\u00bb. The amount of detail put into their performances is incredible. If you watch closely, you can see that the guitarist holds the correct chords, the drummer hits the right drums and the bassist plays as if it was a real performance. Now THAT is amazing since anime often just lets the guitarists hand slide up and down the neck of the guitar and so forth. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe musical score includes everything from quick and funny piano pieces to blood rushing and emotional orchestra. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme \u00abMy Soul, Your Beats!\u00bb is a beautiful piano song with a quick pace and fitting lyrics. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending theme \u00abBrave Song\u00bb is a more typical calming song which fits well in after action scenes or emotional moments. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe one flaw I can find about Angel Beats is that it has a too wide cast for a 13 episode series where background stories and motives is what makes the character. You only get to know the story of a few chosen characters, sometimes even new characters that enter along the way of the story. There were many characters I wanted to know more about, but never got to. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe series finishes off with a satisfying final episode. \\n\r\nIt may have a few other minor flaws, but all the brilliance of the series makes them irrelevant. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is one for all tastes, and it will have you crying and laughing at the same time. You will start thinking about your own life in comparison to the pasts of the members of the Battlefront and get caught in deep thought. It is visual and musical brilliance, and I would recommend seeing this if you want a mix of everything. It did turn into one of my favorites the moment I finished it, and the same may happen to you. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nRating from 1 to 10: \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9 (it was too short to cover all its potential)\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9 (failed at revealing important info about many interesting characters)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A solid 9,5\\n",

            "content": "In depth review #9 - Angel Beats\r\nAngel Beats is one of those shows that falls under the \u201ccontroversial\u201d category of anime. Shows that also fall in this category (Tokyo ghoul, Sword Art Online, and Future Diary) always find themselves the subject of a pointless argument online. Usually if the anime in question is overrated or not. The thing with these type of anime is that most of them are overrated monstrosities while the rest of them are actually worth watching.If you were wondering, Angel Beats is one of the better ones in this category. Angel Beats has an interesting plot, nice animation, and was enjoyableenough to make me watch the entire show in one sitting. HOWEVER, something that is true about all of these shows is that none of them deserves the praise they always receive. Angel Beats isn\u2019t an exception. This became apparent once I really analyzed the series closely. I started noticing questionable things that made this anime slowly lose its luster after each revelation. It also sucks wondering how much justice a mere 13 extra episode would have had done for this short anime.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 6.25 (Fair)\\n\\n\r\nThe Good \u2013 The plot for Angel Beats, in my opinion, was really interesting. The story follows a bunch of teenagers who were sent to a high school after they died. Since they haven\u2019t gone to heaven or hell, the people who are sent to this place are in some type of purgatory. The reason why this kids are here is, because none of them have had a good/fulfilled childhood when alive. The way I perceive this purgatory is that it\u2019s a second wind for these people to truly enjoy themselves, and to have fun with others their own age. I thought this was an amazing concept to dwell into. This show\u2019s interpretation of the afterlife was unique, and kept me thinking along the way. It started thinking about life in general. Was my life fulfilled? What scenarios would warrant someone to be sent here?? Is there a god? Once obliterated, do you go to another distant realm in the afterlife, or be reincarnated as someone else? These are the questions that conjured in my mind when watching this show. Angel Beats take on the afterlife is very thought provoking, and is what kept me watching the show. I just had to find out more about the world these people are stuck in. \\n\\n\r\nThe Bad \u2013Despite how much I feel about the plot, the show as a whole felt unfinished. The cause of this was due to this shows large cast, and how certain episode were set up. The shining moments this story were illuminated during the episodes that went into the back stories of people at the school. The episodes that features the main character's, and the lead singer\u2019s back stories were hands down the best part of this anime. These episodes gave you got a glimpse of the crummy lives these kids had, and why they were here in the first place. These episodes were deep, engaging, and very emotional. Instead of following this formula though, and going through everybody\u2019s back stories, the show goes on a tangent. They dwell more into the battles between the SSS, and the angel instead of the character development. Towards the end of the show \u2013 they only managed to reveal 5 peoples back stories from the 18 characters in the show. This is Angel Beats biggest flaw. The story could have had been an amazing journey of getting a second chance at life; about getting justice for how unfair life is, but it wasn\u2019t. The worst thing about all of this is that there were episodes that were completely unnecessary, and could have had been used to acknowledge the people in the show. All I can say is that this story was wasted potential. \\n\r\nIn addition to my feelings on the state of the show, Angel Beats had pacing issues. This is usually the case for most anime that try to portray a story in 13 episode. This wasn\u2019t the case for this anime in the beginning, but towards the end of the show, everything went by ridiculously fast. There was this one scene during episode 12 where they jammed 6 episodes worth of content in it. This scene had something to do with a couple of kids moving on at once. It has spoilers so I won\u2019t say much about it. They tried to mask this though by using emotional dialogue and circumstance, but it felt too haphazard and rushed. If you need further clarification, just compare the pacing of the first couple of episodes with the last 3. They tried to do too much in this anime, and ultimately made it worse in the process. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8 (Very Good)\\n\\n\r\nJust by looking at Angel Beats, you can tell that it\u2019s nicely animated. Most of this praise comes from the characters though. All of them were drawn nicely, and move around fluidly on screen. There was never a time, that I can recall, that the characters looked awkward. Since this show has a lot of action in it, the scenes where the characters where fighting actually look realistic. The body/hair movement, the reaction times, and even the moves certain characters used looked natural instead of being cartoony. Angel Beats also has a couple of scene with explosions, and supernatural effects going on in them; all of which were also nicely animated. This is where most of the appeal for the show stems from, and with good reason. As for the backgrounds, all of them felt stagnant. They were all made using a bright color pallet, but nothing moved in them at all. It was like looking at a painting, and watching the characters in the show move within them. Actually, the only things that moved on screen where the characters. This made certain parts of the show feel empty. The only exceptions where the rock concert scenes which were visually stunning. The last thing I want to talk about is the opening theme. Angel Beat\u2019s opening is one of my favorites. The animation for it was really good, and had meaning. Every episode had a slightly different opening which had scenes from that specific episode in it. I just thought it was cool. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.25 (Very Good)\\n\\n\r\nWhile listening through the OST for Angel Beats, I didn\u2019t have any complaints about it. All of the songs in it were really good actually. The majority of the music in the OST were piano solos. Some of them were intense, some of them had vocals, and some of them were softly played & atmospheric. None of them sounded the same which I thought was interesting. As far as  recommendations go , \u201cMy Most Precious Treasure \u201c, \u201cBrave Soul\u201d, and obviously the opening theme where good imo. As stand-alone tracks \u2013 they all hold their own, but they all shine when they played in accordance with their intended scenes.  As for the voice acting, the subs where very good. The emotional scenes is where these actors really make you believe their characters are real. As for the dub, it\u2019s just best to stay away from it. The voice actors for the kids weren\u2019t symbiotic, and felt off (except for Yuki, her voice actor was good). Most of the male supporting mains had zero emotion in their voices, and failed to personify their characters. Some of them even sounded like they were well into their 30\u2019s which was distracting. Overall, the sound was one point. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5.75 (Mediocre) \\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats, honestly, had one of the weakest casts of main characters I've seen in a while. Most of the people in the cast were poorly developed, and/or had no purpose, but to be used as comedic devices. For an example, one character in the cast literally says one phrase the entire anime, which is \u201cyou\u2019re an idiot\u201d, and that's it lol. There was another character, who was an American stereotype that couldn\u2019t form a single coherent sentence anytime he talked. At first these characters seemed interesting, but it became clear to me, while watching the show, they are just poorly design characters. This is sad because this was true almost for everyone in the main character lineup. They were presented as a diverse interesting group of people in the beginning, but later turned into background characters that didn\u2019t get a chance to be developed properly. Even the main character, who does get a chance to develop wasn\u2019t that interesting. He is a dull, boring protagonist that just seems to be going with the flow rather than leading the story. He has amnesia during half of the show, and does get better after he recalls his memories, but not by much. Angel started off interesting, but she turned out to be just another Rei clone from NGE. \\n\r\nThe only exceptions I can think of would be Masami Iwasawa, the original lead guitarist for the SSS, who managed to have more depth, and personality than almost everyone in the show in only 1 episode. Besides her, Yuri Nakamura (the leader of the SSS group), Hinata Hideki (the guy who like baseball), and Yui (the bubbly girl her replaces Masami) are the only passable characters in the show. If you haven\u2019t noticed the pattern yet, these are the characters that had their own dedicated episodes. The characters that Angel Beats actually acknowledged of being main characters where the ones who were the most developed, who would of guessed? I talked about how the black story specific episodes were what made Angel Beats special in the story section above. Seeing how the more interesting mains are the ones who did have back story only proves my point. It\u2019s just sad though that out of a cast of 15+ people, only around five of them were worth caring about. It\u2019s worse when that doesn\u2019t even include the main character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 (Very Good)\\n\\n\r\nDismissing all of the in depth analysis I made for this anime, Angel Beats was very enjoyable. While watching the show, all I wanted to do was see more of what this show had to offer. There were times when I laughed, and others where I had mixed emotions. The ending was a little tear-jerky, but I watched sadder shit that. I held it together. Angel Beats was an anime with a cool plot, nice animation, good music, and a lot of action. Basically everything that was done right, was great. After it ended though, I kind of felt empty. I thought this anime was going to have more than what I got. It was so hyped up that I thought it was going to be a masterpiece, but instead I got Angel Beats. Anyways, this show is definitely a good short anime to binge through. If you can look past the blatant flaws, and enjoy it for what it is, go for it. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 7.25/10 (Good) - Overhyped?, yes - Worth the watch?, yes",

            "content": "I loved Angel Beats and took me just a few days to watch it. There were very sad and emotional moments that could get me to tear up, like the ending. But there were also very hilarious scenes as well, preventing it from being a depressing series. There is a large amount of characters that work in the story, but only over a handful are given solid character development because of the fact that there is only 13 episodes. Yet there are episodes that focus on one character and their sad past before the afterlife, which should give that character a good amount of developmentand makes them more likable, like in Cowboy Bebop. The main flaw with Angel Beats is that there is only 13 episodes. As a result, there is lack of character development, as stated before. Too many characters, not enough development. The music was also excellent, usually I just skip the openings and endings of anime not to waste time, but it's just hard to resist the temptation of listening to it. The English dub is actually not bad, which I can't say for other series. The voices seem to fit all the characters and won't damage your ears, lol. The art is also well done. Overall I give Angel Beats an 8 out of 10 and recommend it. But beware, the ending might make you cry.",

This was probably one of the few times that I couldn't skip either of the songs because of how great they were.\r\n But the show itself I have mixed feelings about, for the first half of the show its a great comedy  mixed with drama and great flashbacks of the characters past, and awesome action scenes. But around the second half that's when thingsstarted to get lets say 'STUPID'.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I blame the pacing of the show for that. Everything felt rushed to the point that I didn't care about the characters anymore because none of them got developed other than the main character and a few side characters, I cant even remember their names because that's how forgetful they are, and please don't talk about the love confession in the ending it came out of no where, I mean there were a quite a few interactions between the two but nothing to solidify them as being in love.( Although the organ donor reveal was actually pretty good).  \\n\\n\r\nAll in all if this show was 25 or 26 episodes to fully develop the characters and story I would've enjoyed it hell of a lot more than I did, But one thing a cant deny is that I enjoyed it a lot more than clannad and clannad after story, which again doesn't say alot. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Angel Beats is a fairly recent series that started out as a light novel written by Maeda Jun. It's proven to be a commercial success with two ongoing manga, an OVA and a thirteen episode anime. There may be even more to come but, for now at least, I'm just going to take a look at the anime.  \r\nThe story follows a young man named Otonashi who wakes up with no memories near a school and is promptly told that he's dead. Not knowing what else to do he joins the Afterlife Battlefront who are fighting against a girl they call Tenshi and tryingto avoid disappearing. The story has a unique premise and it blends light-hearted humour with occasionally serious moments pretty seamlessly. A lot of the reason it succeeds at that is that the characters are already dead so it can use darker humour without it crossing into ghoulish or tasteless territory. Most of the jokes work well and the plot, while fast-paced, never feels rushed. The action sequences are very well done. The only real issue is that one of the major plot points at the end comes out of nowhere and doesn't make a lot of sense. If I were going to nitpick I would also say that they really could explore the philosophy behind their situation with more depth, but the anime really isn't intended to be too serious so that's not really a problem. \\n\\n\r\nThe major characters are very interesting and get some nice backstory and development. Otonashi, Hinata, Yuri and a few others get very engaging and tragic back stories that help flesh out their characters. The issue is that most of the characters are secondary and they range from one to two dimensional. They aren't complex nor is there much reason to care about them. This is probably due primarily to time constraints, but it's still kind of annoying. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is very nicely done. A lot of the backgrounds are pretty minimal, but that helps set up the world and it works. The character designs are very unique and vibrant and the fight scenes are very energetic and well executed. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is really good. Particularly Kamiya Hiroshi, Sakurai Harumi, Kimura Ryohei and Ogata Megumi. The only real weakness is Rivas Michael who delivers his lines very stagnantly. Fortunately, he doesn't have a very big role so it isn't too much of an issue. The music is spectacular. The compositions are vibrant and the vocal performances are incredible. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 1.5/10. There are some kind of homoerotic moments between two of the girls toward the end, but that's it. \\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Angel Beats is an 8.4/10. The premise is very interesting and the execution is good. Some of the humour falls short, a lot of the characters lack development and there's a bad plot point, but those aren't huge grievances and they probably won't affect your enjoyment of the series too much.",

            "content": "Angel Beats....Angel Beats, oh what a very overrated show you are. Angel Beats........Angel Beats, oh how I want to forget the ending episode so much. \r\n*NOTE: There will be some spoilers in my review. You have been warned*\r\nStory (3/10)\r\nThe story takes place in a world after people die. Angels fight for their fate and future. In short, these teens died in the real world and they're now in purgatory except that the purgatory in this anime is a high school setting. In my opinion, the story is horrible. The anime had a nice idea but horrible execution. I know the anime only had 13 episodesbut that doesn't change the fact that the anime had terrible story and rushed plot with poor story development. The show also felt like these teens were stuck in a virtual gaming world because they use some gaming terms like \"NPC\" and \"Guild\". It felt like SAO but way worse. I'm not saying SAO is bad because I love that anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation (9/10)\\n\r\nAt least the animation is great. The environment felt it was well designed and the character design was unique and different from other animes I've seen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack (8/10)\\n\r\nThe anime is full of music. Half of them are great and half of them are ear-torturing mess. The OP was ok and the ending song was wonderful. I also love how the ending song is used for comedy. I.e, when the characters get hurt or when they \"die\". Notice I put a quotation mark. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10) (SPOILERS)\\n\r\nThe characters in the show are at least likable with some few annoying characters. Only some of them got an interesting past but all of them got a poor character development. The romance between some few characters are horrible. There was no romantic development whatsoever. For example, Hideki and Yui becoming a couple felt like the director just came up with it 1 day before the episode actually aired. There was no hints of them being in love or something. All in all, they still did a decent job with the characters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10)\\n\r\nThe reason why I managed to watch Angel Beats is because it's short and the funny moments are different here than the one shown in the other animes. Death here is treated as a joke and the creators use that to their advantage to create some funny death moments. I only enjoyed the anime because of the comedy but not the story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6.6/10) (SPOILERS)\\n\r\nOverall, the anime is not the best as people claimed it to be. It's just too overrated. The anime had a horrible story. Like I said above, the comedy is the reason why I think the anime is decent. Even the ending was a complete mess. Yuzuru saying \"I love you\" to Kanade was a complete surprise for me because there was no hints of any one of them being in love. It also felt like it was thrown in the show out of nowhere. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Great Animation\\n\r\n-Great Soundtrack\\n\r\n-Funny moments are different (i.e death treated as a joke)\\n\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Horrible story\\n\r\n-Nice Idea but horribly executed\\n\r\n-Poor character development\\n\r\n-Poor story development\\n\r\n-Romance thrown in out of nowhere \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Every now and then, you come across several anime and manga that strike you with a certain emotional response, be it through the adrenaline-rushing fight scenes or the heartfelt drama that continually stirs up your deep, innermost emotions. The other side of anime and manga is when they start to make you ponder over reality, whether it be about the things that truly matter which we as humans fail to notice, or the fact that life can throw something very harsh and cruel at you that it makes you want to fight against it.\r\nThough there are some anime and manga that only fit into eitherthe entertainment category or the philosophical category, Angel Beats seems to fit in both, at least from my point of view. There were parts in the anime that had me at the edge of my seat through the action and fight scenes while there were parts that truly touched my heart to the point that I teared up. However, the message that the anime is trying to convey is actually deeper than I thought it would be. You can't really understand it if you look at it at face value. The characters were fighting against the cruel life they lived because they couldn't accept their fate and death. During the course of the series, they had to struggle with issues like fate, existence, self-worth, death, and finding fulfillment that, in the long run, would help them pass on from the afterlife. In the end, they learned to accept the life they had lived because they as human beings could never really change the things that already happened, no matter how hard they try to fight against it. It had me thinking and connecting the dots during and after I watched it.\\n\\n\r\nBefore watching, I daresay that my expectations for this show were high since it was highly recommended by some of my batch mates. It took me a long time before I got convinced to actually give it a shot. Prior to that, I watched some AMV's (Animated Music Videos) about this anime, and I can say that the art and animation is what got me enticed at first sight. At first, I thought that this was merely an anime about music, since I saw girls singing and playing the guitar, and the fact that this angel-looking girl was playing the piano in the opening. By the time I finally watched it, the anime is actually deeper than I thought.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say that the story has great potential, but the packaging seemed to be lacking. It just felt kind of abrupt and rushed, especially the ending. There were still some loose ends that the writer/s failed to tie up. The sequencing was quite messy, and I have to admit that there were some parts in the anime wherein the characters were just wasting their time. And thus, it's quite lacking in character development, as well. I wish they gave focus to all the significant characters more (ex. their past) instead of using them to act like complete retards. The story had a lot of potential, and it has a beautiful message. It could've been fleshed out better, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation was impeccable. The music was in tune to the mood of the series, and that's one of the things that I really love about this anime. I especially loved Iwasawa's \"My Song\" and the ending theme. The ending theme encapsulates the whole meaning of the anime in a way I couldn't fully comprehend. It brings out a feeling of gentleness and peace after every episode. I also loved the fact that Otonashi, the protagonist, reflects on the things the battlefront went through before an episode ends. The anime gets a plus for that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Angel Beats is enjoyable to watch. Though there are times when the comedy gets too exaggerated, the way they stir up your emotions is heartfelt. It's not overly-dramatic, per se. Nonetheless, it will entertain and make you think at the same time. It's quite a unique and thought-provoking experience.",

            "content": "Angel Beats..... What a train wreck of a show this was....\r\nThis story has a unique plot for any type of media I have seen. The anime was WAYYYYYY tooo short. It  should has been a 24 episode instead of a 12. All I am going to say is that there is a HUUUUUGE gap between episode 11 and 12 where there should has been 12 episodes between that gap. All they give is a crappy explanation on what happened. Also, there is a huge confusing line that Angel says (if you have seen the show you know what I'm talking about. But, the comedyis also pretty funny.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was kind of good for the show it was. There is nothing to say about it it's not good or bad or anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has a pretty good soundtrack. Heck I've learned Ichiban no Takaramano on the guitar myself. The opening is really good but, the English dub is FUCKING SHIT. I've seen both of the versions of the anime and there is a significant different difference between them. One is SHIT while the other is NOT shit.\\n\\n\r\nOh god here comes the train. The main characters are if you copy pasted Haruhi's characters into the main characters. Yurippe is Haruhi, Angel is Yuki Nagato, and Otanashi is just one of the blandest characters in existence. If they make a spin-off(which they won't) of the side characters I probably would like that show 2 times more. (shout out to Yurippe's evil laugh)\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment overall, is not that enjoyable. It has a tear jerking ending (still doesn't tear jerk as much as Anohana, or Clannad) The last episode makes no sense which I can't say without spoiling the show. The show was so rushed and there was such forced romance that Yoda doesn't have enough to match it.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall this anime is kind of enjoyable but the characters and story sucks.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlot",

            "content": "This is by far one of my all time favorite anime. 'Angel Beats' is one of those anime that starts off extremely goofy but eventually, as the series develops, it reaches deep inside the characters emotions and tears apart their backstories they must overcome creating a masterpiece. If you like to see shows that really get inside peoples heads and emotions, this is the show for you. 'Angel Beats' is quite silly at times but also serious during other times. Even though I highly recommend this show as it is just so heart gripping, there is one thing I would like to warn you aboutbefore you do so. Since this series has such a goofy style of comedy, some of the characters personalities are extremely exaggerated and sometimes even unrealistic. Imagine a typical anime character stereotype but 20 times more exaggerated. Some of the characters are like that in order to add comedy to the series. (not all of them)\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest aspect of this show that makes it so good is all the characters amazing backstories and the soundtrack used to go with them. If you end up watching to the end, (which I would highly recommend because the end is the best part) you will have a really good idea what I am talking about. The soundtrack played throughout this show is probably one of the most fitting, and best soundtracks I have ever heard from any other show. If you are looking for a tragic, heart-gripping and a little bit goofy experience than this is the show for you.",

            "content": "**Spoiler warning**\r\nI had high hopes for Angel Beats, but I have to say I was quite disappointed with the result. I heard a lot about the show before I had watched it and I was told Angel Beats is about friendship, romance, love and a bit of action. After finishing Angel Beats I had seen too little of those themes and I ended up craving for more episodes. Which is the problem of Angel Beats. There are not enough episodes to finish the intriguing story.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nThe story and setting had so much potential. I loved the concept of a place where people go towhen they die with too much regret to move on to heaven. The concept is original, but 13 episodes were just not enough for Angel Beats. If only they decided to do 24/26 episodes or even 20 episodes. Then the story could've been much more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nI don't have anything to say about the sound, other then the fact that the soundtrack was good and the songs in the story were even better. You can't argue with the greatness of the music used in Angel Beats.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7/10\\n\r\nI loved the MC and a few other characters, but just as I mentioned earlier there were too few episodes to truely identify with all the characters in Angel Beats. The Character Development could've been amazing with 20-24 episodes, but when you focus on the MC for 10 episodes and only use romance in the last 3 episodes. That doesn't feel right in my opinion. The love felt out of place. The MC only knew the other MC for a very short period and they're supposed to be in love already. If this show had more episodes it could've been one of the best new animes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\r\nThe lack of character development and episodes really affected my opinion of this show. I really want to love this show, but I ended up not caring for most of the characters. It really is a shame.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\r\nYou might wonder why I still gave Angel Beats an 8/10? It's because it wasn't a bad show, to be honest it was far from bad. The fact that a lot of potential was wasted is the only thing keeping me from giving Angel Beats a 9/10. If they ever decide to make another season or reboot the 13 episodes, then maybe I will change my mind. For now I'm really disappointed this show wasn't longer than 13 episodes.",

            "content": "Angel beats, an Anime that's widely-known amongst the community. \r\nThe show has an umpteen of goods and bads, surprisingly it being a favorite and one of the first Animes that I've watched, I have to put the bias aside and point-out the flaws that the show possesses. Angel beats may be a tear-jerking show for the fragile hearts and it has quite the touching story but when we look more in-depth to what the story really is about, it's tangled in vary of things -- setting, the plot, back-story, execution, denouement, etc -- which explains the many questions that you'll ask after watching, to cut-itshort the story is badly written & executed, disregarding a lot of vital things that you would want to know to understand the Anime. Guessing that the writers left it for our imaginations it still builds up the confusion around the story plus the bad execution of certain crisis that the characters face. The Anime has 13 episodes, right-off-the-bat you would know you're most likely not getting a well-paced story-line however I think it does convey what it should convey but doesn't go anymore explanatory and it will leave things hanging, which will lead up to you, again, asking many questions therefore spending hours on wiki or a forum site reading a lot of theories by other people or yourself trying to figure out on certain aspects that the Anime lacked in explanation. \\n\\n\r\nThat is one of the biggest flaws in Angel Beats, the lack of explanation. There are scads of plot-holes that needs to be covered in which the author ignored & coats everything with emotional events. Again, the story isn't all that bad, it's a very good emotional Anime that will may leave you in tears and is obviously why the Anime did become popular. If you ignore the lack of explanation, the Anime would be an enjoyable watch and I think that is one way to enjoy this Anime \"don't come up with questions now, go with the flow with what's being shown and ask questions later\". \\n\\n\r\nSo, why watch Angel beats if you're spewing all these dismissive things about the story? Objectively, Angel beats is substandard & poor in terms of writing. Though, like what I've said, I enjoyed it. I might get subjective in this part & mostly based on personal preference. The feeling of an \"Afterlife\", the emotional tale that the author puts into these characters & the world they're in, is imposing to my curiosity that I want to know more! The fact how they some-what build up these groups of characters in each sub-plot peeks the attention of mine, achieving a \"bittersweet\" end. The story is bad in explanation & every plot-hole in the Anime can be frustrating, yet if you have an imagination, you fill-up the plot-holes (took me weeks to get over the thoughts of Angel Beats) and I do know that's not your job to do, again basing it on my personal judgment but that's how I look at it. I love stories that are related to Death & the after life with the emotional events that the Anime presents, so I liked it & that's my reason why.\\n\\n\r\nGoing on to the characters, they were well-done from the back-story, personality, build-up, humor and the chemistry that this big group of characters had together. Which made the Anime enjoyable because you have this mix of emotions from anger, sadness & happiness. Although one of the downsides that the Anime has, (which is not related to the character writing) there are around 10-12 characters some of which have ample amount of screen time throughout the Anime BUT only out of that amount you get 4-5 characters that were properly developed, having there own background-development and the ones who didn't are disregarded. I mean these group of characters are intriguing and it's sad to see that not all got their progression, which I would say is a waste of good potential characters. These 5 characters that were developed, had really good background-stories, good development and you can just feel the emotions that the characters portrayed and which many fans can relate. Which is also why the Anime got popular, I could very well say it's a flaw and it's indeed disappointing to see a good amount of unique characters that didn't have their special part in the Anime. Hoping we could see a season 2 or a remake (which we probably won't) I think Angel beats would go further in the ranking charts if it just had a bit more episodes & was solidly executed, it would have been a \"chef d oeuvre\". Or that's how I'd look at it, if it did.\\n\\n\r\n Music is awe-inspiring, Godly composed if I must say, the lyrics are nicely written bringing emotions & meaning to one-self, the instrumental speaks to your ears and I may sound like I'm exaggerating my admiration to the music (and probably I am) but the music is one of the great facets the Anime has. The soundtracks consist of piano and acoustic,  J-rock which the guitar solos and riffs were astounding to listen to. (Which is kinda sad now that the actual band has disbanded.) \u200b\\n\\n\r\nI have no complaints over the animation & art-style, it's your average, nevertheless still bringing out the visual beauty in the Anime. To end this off the Anime is a hit or miss but for people who are looking for a tear-jerker or an over-all emotional Anime, this is for you and you'll love it! I enjoyed it to the point where my tears could halfy fill a bottle-cap, this brought me into the Anime world and I think it would be best for thee people who love the genre(and who want to cry because they have fragile hearts). The flaws I said is to factually review the Anime and to point out so people who are expecting more won't be dissappointed. Nonetheless, I personally love the Anime. Give it a watch! :D",

I'll explain near the end.\r\nIts starts off when a amensiac student wakes up in a strange world where students learn to give up any lingering attachments they still have from life before passing on but while fighting a strange angel like being.\r\nThe looks are just amazing it has a very bright view on things even though going through pretty dark situations it just looks good.\r\nThe soundtrack is just good and tear jerking Idownloaded it and feel emotional listening to it, its just a good soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nNow! I love Angel Beats but there is 2 things wrong with it. These don't ruin the anime but I have to agree with these problems. \\n\\n\r\n1. To short (Which isn't a problem but the other problem explains why)\\n\r\n2. Character development!!!\\n\\n\r\nThe show gives us an amazing cast of characters so everyone can have there own favourite character.....BUT they didn't really give us time or back story to actually make us care enough for each character if something happened to them, Not saying I didn't care but again I didn't care as much. (Except for T.K he's just to awesome)\\n\\n\r\nBut yeah other then that the show had its emotional moments (mostly the end) it had its dramatic moments its jaw dropping moments and just a good show.

            "content": "This is my first review, so I hope I do this right. \r\nLet me start out by saying that this is not an unbiased review. This is a review based on my own feelings on the anime and what it did for me. Objectively I think this anime would get maybe a 5, with the art and sound making up for the bad writing. Also expect spoilers, since I cannot say everything I want to say without spoiling a good amount of the plot.\r\nOkay, so now for the actual review. This anime is not a masterpiece. This anime is not great. It's not even good.People who love this show will tell you it's \"amazing\", or that it has \"lots of feels\". \"I cried so hard\" is something people say a lot when they talk about this anime. Admittedly, it had some very emotional moments in it, which is what saved the show from getting a 1. The characters are terrible, the plot is a mess, and the parts that are supposed to be sad, with the exception of one or two, were laughable. As soon as you turn on your brain and start thinking about what you're watching, you realize what a bad show this is.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 2/10\\n\r\nThe first episode seemed really interesting. We have our main character thrust into this world without any memories (which was a bit cliche, but wasn't a huge deal) or understanding of what's going on. Enter Yuri with a big-ass gun saying that they needed to fight against Tenshi, a girl with white hair who seemed to be the Yuki Nagato of this show. The first episode sets of mysteries that keep you interested. Who is Tenshi? What is this world? Why is everybody fighting her? What does it mean to get obliterated? However, as the series went on, it seemed like the writer didn't have a clue what he was doing, with some scenes, and at times, whole episodes, that could have easily been cut out. Things happen for no reason and have no real consequence. If you want to not be spoiled stop here, because I'm about to talk about some major events that happen later on. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, so you watch episode two and you're like \"wow that backstory was pretty great. This anime looks promising.\" Yuri's backstory does have some holes in it. For example, who the hell leaves their 4 kids at home. I'd understand if they were older and more mature, but they look like they're around 6-8. It says the police showed up thirty minutes later after all her siblings were dead. But when did Yuri call them? It doesn't show her doing it. I suppose she could have done it offscreen, but then why did it take them so long to show up? Why did the robbers send Yuri off on her own to find things? Would it not make sense for them to go with her? She could have run away and gotten help, or called the police if she hadn't already. And if there was someone else there with her, they would have found out that she had no idea where anything valuable was and might have given up and left. Then again, they were crazy and brutal enough to consider killing these kids, so that's not guaranteed. Regardless, it's a fine backstory. \\n\r\nYou then watch episode 3. This is one of those episodes that is actually really great. Iwasawa talks to the MC about her backstory. Now, you might ask why she was telling him, but it's not something I'm going to make a huge deal about. Her backstory is one of the ones I actually cried a little over. It's beautiful and it makes sense. However, it's sadly the only episode I can say that about. Except maybe episode 9\\n\r\nAfter this we finally arrive at the beginning of the end. Episode 4 is where we get the backstory of Hinata. Right from the get go I had a feeling that this was going to be an okay episode at best. Not because I dislike sports, but because it came out of nowhere. I'd heard from other people that the plot was a little bit all over the place, and this marked the beginning of that. It's literally an episode about them playing baseball. And it didn't even have any point either. It didn't have to be there. Hinata's backstory could have been delivered in a way just like Iwasawa's and Yuri's. Have him open up to the main character. You don't need an entore episode of filler in order to do that. Another thing that happens is we get a small hint of what obliterating is. But that also happened in the last episode. And then Otonashi later figures it out anyways. There were other opportunities that DIDN'T INVOLVE A COMPLETELY POINTLESS BASEBALL GAME. Okay end of caps lock. \\n\r\nEpisode 6 is what truly ruined the anime. It's full of plot holes and asspulls. Yuri gives Otonashi a radio for literally no reason and all I can think is \"oh I wonder when this is going to be used\". Tenshi and Otonashi then get locked in a cell underneath the school that the student council president has supposedly been building for a long time, despite the fact that he only became president like a day ago. We get some talking and then out of nowhere Yuri's like \"a battle has broken out. Everyone is dying. We need you.\" This battle is one of the most useless things that has ever happened in this anime. Not only is all tension completely gone because none of these characters can die (it seems like the plot forgot about this for the duration of the battle, or simply ignored it for dramatic effect), but it seemed to happen for no reason. Like the author was like \"oh shit we need a reason for these characters to try to get out and an excuse for more backstory. I know, let's have a battle and make it really sad. That way people won't realize how stupid it is\". Lazy writing at it's finest. We also are treated to the student council president's backstory in this episode and oh my god is it funny. The best way I can describe it is like it's a Harry Potter backstory, except done really poorly. Literally nothing good ever happens to him. He's always criticized by his dad, his brother is constantly better. Even when he wins a contest his dad is like \\n\r\nnot good enough\". It's just ridiculous and immersion breaking. \\n\\n\r\nThere's two more things about the plot I want to talk about. I'd be amazed if anyone read this far but w/e. I just feel like talking about this anime. \\n\r\n1) the multiple Tenshis \\n\r\n2) The shadow creatures introduced in episode 11\\n\r\nBoth of these things didn't need to be in here. They could have been stories all on their own, which is what they felt like. This is, along with episode 6, is the main downfall of Angel Beats. The plot lacks focus. Both of those stories (Multiple Tenshis and Shadow Creatures) could have each been a series on their own. There was no reason for them to be in this story. It felt like the writer was just throwing in every idea he had without considering how it would destroy the pacing and focus of the plot. It was just stupid and unnecessary. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nOne of the stronger points of Angel Beats was the characters. Or rather, the few characters we get to know. Yui, Iwasawa, Yuri, and Otonashi are really the only characters that are developed enough for you to care about anything that happens to them. One of the other downfalls of Angel Beats is that it doesn't develop it's characters well enough. It spends time on the backstories of boring side characters like Hinata and the student council president rather than the interesting characters. For example T.K. The basic idea is that you get to this world if something horrible happened to you, which is why everybody has a tragic backstory. And yet T.K. always seems happy. He's always dancing, always willing to help people. He talks in English a lot. He's an interesting character, and had a lot of potential for development and backstory. Why is he so happy? Why does he talk in English all the time? These are a few examples of things that could and should have been answered, rather than wasting time on that stupid baseball episode. And what about Tenshi? We learn that she has Otonoshi's heart (although we still don't get a good reason for it). That's it. We don't learn why she was dying. We don't learn the events leading up to it. It was a huge waste of potential. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nNothing much to say here. I liked the character designs, art style, and general look of the world very much.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe voice acting wasn't amazing, but it was decent. Soundtrack was good, fir with the scenes nicely and the way it was used was good. Still, none of the songs really stuck with me, which is why this only gets a 7.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere are ways in which this series could have been great. In particular, it should have been structured kind of like Bokurano. That's kind of what it was going for anyways. We were learning about the backstories of all the characters, and learning a bit about the world while we were at it, as well as developing relationships between them.  Rather than having everybody disappear at the end of the series, we could have learned about them and their backstory/life before they \"died\", like what they did with Yui. I would have had much more attachment to them and the story would have had a clear focus and goal. The first three episodes were great, and if the rest of it had been like that, I might also be aboard the \"this is an amazing anime\" train. But sadly, it got off track, deviating from what could have been a great plot in order to focus on pointless side stories. The writing was dreadful, leaving the story full of holes. It was as if the writer didn't care about the story and only cared about getting out the tears, which it failed at doing anyways. The ending for this anime was pretty great. The graduation scene was kind of cliche, as it's been done before with a similar effect and goal in mind. That last scene between Otonashi and Tenshi however, was far and away the best scene in the anime. Him asking her to stay and her dying speech was one of the most emotional moments in the anime, and it was one of the only scenes that truly made me feel something for these characters. If only they'd made Tenshi a better character...\\n\\n\r\nI don't doubt that this review is going to upset some people, since I get the impression that my opinion of the show is the minority, but I hope that I was able to change some people's perspective's on the show. This is a series you need to turn off your brain to enjoy. At least it's better than Charlotte...",

            "content": "Angel Beats is a show, thats definitely not perfect. But its the way of \"not perfect\", that your girlfriend is. You know all the little mistakes, you can even see what she does wrong, but you would still rate her 10/10. I just have to say, that i really loved angel beats, although this review might not show it really well.\r\nI dont think i will convince anyone to watch the show with this review, so i wanna say one thing first:\r\nDont expect too much from this show. If you watch it, expect some good comedie and artwork, but dont expect a life changing experience. Itotally think the show is worth watching, even if you dont get caught. Not everyone has to love it, but theres a small chance that you will. Watch a single episode every month and maybe one night you cant resist watching it all at once, like i did yesterday.\\n\\n\\n\r\n---Story 9/10---\\n\r\nI really didnt get the story in the beginning and it didnt catch me at all. The plot seemed to be a bit forced: Just lots of stuff happening and not a single explanation. Random action, random enemy, random story line without any clear way, where it might be going.\\n\r\nBut with every episode my interests grew and it was around the 5th episode when i finally couldn't stop any more. I finally understood that the story wasnt about a clear story line, but about the development of the characters, which is the main purpose of angel beats according to my opinion. If you want an anime with a straight story line and a well defined goal, like for example One Piece always had, Angel Beats isnt a good choice.\\n\r\nI also understood that you cant rate the story after the first few episodes. In the end, most of the questions get answered and you finally realize that the story just needed some time to present the characters and define their situation.\\n\\n\r\n---Characters 9/10---\\n\r\nWe dont get to know anything about the main character in the beginning, as he himself doesnt even know who he is. But as i already said, its a lot about the development of characters, so it was pretty cool to see how he grew.\\n\\n\r\nAmong the other characters, we got a lot of different types. Some of them can be defined with in one sentence, but that mustnt be considered as flat characters, they are just simple and i think they brought a lot of life into the anime.\\n\r\nOf course, there are also some complex characters and as we get background stories about them, we understand the way they are and why they are that way.\\n\r\nAll together we have a pretty colorful mixture of personalities. The only problem is, that its sometimes just a bit too many people.\\n\\n\r\n---Sound 9/10---\\n\r\nPretty cool soundtrack, loved the songs, have heard better ones though\\n\\n\r\n---Enjoyment 10/10---\\n\r\nAngel Beats offers great comedie, so you will always have a certain amount of enjoyment, even if you arent caught by the story or you dont even know whats going on. Also the characters are funny, as they act together.\\n\\n\r\n---Overall 10/10---\\n\r\nThe end just hit me right in the feels. It was that awful kind of beautiful and i understand why people dont even get on that feels trip, cause the story was too flat for them and they didnt let the magic into their hearts, but i personally think Angel Beats really wants to tell us something or that it at least is a beautiful story.\\n",

            "content": "Before I get to talking about the anime itself, I just wanted to give a little insight into where I\u2019m coming from with this review.\r\nIt\u2019s been a little over a year since I watched Angel Beats. This show holds special meaning for me because it changed my perception of what anime is. Before I watched this show, I\u2019d only really watched a couple of mainstream anime (the DBZs, Beyblades and Pok\u00e9mons) on TV in my childhood purely for entertainment. That was years ago, and I didn\u2019t really pay attention to anime much after that until my interest was piqued again and I came across thisshow. It showed me that anime can give expression to so many meaningful things that we otherwise completely disregard, and for me at least, evoke so many emotions that I couldn\u2019t have imagined I\u2019d ever feel. It\u2019s after watching this that I came to understand that somehow, anime as a medium can weigh on my empathy more than any other. Angel Beats was my first taste of \u2018feels\u2019 anime, and it has since superseded all others.\\n\\n\r\nSo that was that, and in the year since then I\u2019ve almost exclusively watched a ton of different anime, and I\u2019m back here now to pay my tribute to the one that changed it all for me.\\n\\n\r\nI know there\u2019s already a synopsis on the page, but I\u2019d feel odd continuing without it here so to quickly recap, Angel Beats is set in a post-life world where children of high school age who were still tied down by strong regrets at the time of their deaths are given a chance to erase their bitterness before \u2018moving on\u2019, but the children are unware of this and believe this is the battleground in their fight against \u2018God\u2019 and the unfair lives that they were given. So they stubbornly cling on to their grudges and refuse to accept the recompense given to them. This plot idea itself would have, for me at least, been an instant winner. But this is not immediately apparent when the show starts off, and it takes at least half the show if not more for the first hints to be dropped. I realised only later on what I would have missed if I had judged this show by only its first few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats, in what I have discovered to be typical Key fashion, creates an unfathomable combination of comedy and tragedy that defies all expectations and tugs your heartstrings. Both elements play their roles well with the characters\u2019 personalities and their backstories supporting them throughout. The comic elements do not intrude on the heartrending revelations of the characters\u2019 lives, and likewise the same distress does not dull the comedy whatsoever. They are both well contained in their circumstances and are never mixed untastefully. There are precious few shows that I know of that can make you cry out of laughter and sadness in a single episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development I could say is a mixed bag. The character backstories that are revealed are done excellently and give credence to each character\u2019s being in that world. I can see how some people would feel even these could have been further developed, but I personally find a complete detailing unnecessary. The characters are revealed to us sufficiently that with a little imagination and empathising we can completely relate to their feelings. There are also supporting characters whose stories and reasons for being in that world aren\u2019t revealed at all, but I don\u2019t find that it detracts from the overall experience. I was so caught up with the main characters\u2019 stories that I had no room to pay attention to what was missing. I don\u2019t know their reasons for constraining the show to 13 episodes and I think it would\u2019ve been great if more characters were embellished with backstories, but I don\u2019t find that anything is lost due to its absence. It adds a welcome touch of mystery, especially surrounding one of the most charming characters in the show, the completely nonsensical TK, whom we know nothing about and yet we never question his presence.\\n\\n\r\nSome aspects of Angel Beats that I feel nobody can dispute are its art, animation, voice acting and music. The art and animation is simply gorgeous to look it and would be worth watching for that alone. Also worth watching for alone is the music. The soundtrack encompasses the complete duality of the anime perfectly, with tracks that will be forever reminiscent of particular scenes and emotions. The in-story band\u2019s compositions are also top notch, showing us exactly what the band\u2019s leader (a character whose backstory is one of the first to be revealed) wants in her heart, and wherein lies her biggest regret. The cast\u2019s work in voicing the characters is also superbly done. At certain points it\u2019s hard to believe that there are people just reciting pre-written dialogue and it\u2019s not the characters themselves come to life.\\n\\n\r\nThen comes the ending. Pretty much every other anime I\u2019ve watched I could classify as having a happy or a sad ending, but not this one. On one hand it can make us watchers happy that the characters having had such unfulfilling lives have been redeemed, and yet it\u2019s somehow heart breaking to see them give up their misguided fight and accept their fates. The ending will leave you with a mixed sense of incomprehensible nostalgia and hollowness, while also feeling somehow glad. It\u2019s such a varied bunch of emotion that it\u2019s hard to place Angel Beats as a full-on tragedy. Undoubtedly, one of the sad aspects of the ending is the separation of two of the main characters arising from a decision that one of them makes. But then again, the curious teaser at the end could be seen a resolution to that. Ultimately, I feel that as a story nothing was left incomplete in its conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nWith Angel Beats, Jun Maeda and Key are getting closer to giving us a perfect retelling of a world that we would not otherwise come across. Having since watched all their other anime, I still consider Angel Beats to be their best work in terms of having a complete plot. Although nothing can be perfect, I don\u2019t believe in looking for the imperfections to just to prove it and as long as the imperfections themselves don\u2019t obscure the real value of the show, I\u2019ll happily give it a 10/10.",

            "content": "This is the first review I have written for an anime. I'm unsure if this will ever be read by anyone other than myself, but we shall see.\r\nAngel Beats, in my opinion, is an emotional masterpiece. The characters are all unique (especially TK), and you can feel a connection to each and every one of them. You can really relate to them, and their discussion about human mortality really shook me to my core. It made me question my own life and mortality, especially the ultimate unanswered question: \"What will happen in the end?\"\r\nAs for the story, it was... fantastic. An emotional rollercoaster. The firsttime I watched it is when I marathoned it with my friends. Of course, I couldn't outwardly display sadness around them (I am a MAN after all), so I held it in. And it was EXTREMELY difficult to do so. The finale episode, which I will not summarize for fear of spoiling it, almost had me in tears. So, later on, when I was alone, I rewatched the finale. This is when I could truly feel the emotional impact, and it was not dulled from a second viewing. I broke down and cried. I'm not ashamed to admit it. It was the most emotional end to an anime story that I had ever seen up until that point. It made me feel... not sad per se, but certainly not fully happy. I guess the best way to describe it would be this: I was an emotional wreck. I didn't know what to think. The end left me in shock and tears. BUT, this does not deter me from recommending this anime to others. On the contrary, I recommend that everyone watches it. If you don't feel something, ANYTHING, after watching the finale, you are a cold, emotionless robot in my opinion. Seriously, watch the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it was nicely done. I don't have much to say on the subject, as I'm not really a \"conoisseur\" of anime art styles. I will say that I liked the ambient lighting that was used, and that the action scenes were well done.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said earlier, the characters were fantastic. Again though, I won't detail them much so that I can avoid spoiling anything. I will say though: TK was the funniest character I've ever watched in an anime. His lines were great. As for the other characters, you will have to watch the anime. It is a diverse cast, but somehow you can connect with all of them. They all have relatable traits, despite being so unique from one another.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you like emotion, this anime has it in spades. In fact, I've been tearing up just writing this. There are so many heartfelt moments in the last few episodes, and the finale will make even the hardest man break down in tears. The anime was a beautiful one, and I highly recommend watching it.",

            "content": "Angel Beats! was one of the first shows that I watched when I was starting to really get into anime, and I loved it. So much so that I decided, this past summer, that I was going to re-watch the series. Not only because of how much I enjoyed watching it the first time, but also because when I read reviews or comments about this series there were always people that said the show was incredibly flawed with several plot holes. I wanted to re-watch the series to find out if any of the hate that Angel Beats! received was deserved. After watching the seriesagain, Angel Beats! isn\u2019t the masterpiece that I originally thought it was. But, even though the series has its problems, it\u2019s not nearly as many as some would have you believe.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Angel Beats! is about a group of deceased teenagers who get stuck in a sort of high school purgatory where death is nothing but an inconvenience. These students band together to form the Not Yet Dead Battlefront in order to rebel against God for forcing them to live tragic and unfulfilling lives. The story follows the battlefront on its rebellion, as well as the stories of so me of the characters in it. The series does a good job of making you really want to learn more about the characters, and the world that they are living in. Information about the world and the characters is slowly revealed throughout the series and gives it a sense of mystery, which makes it more interesting. This story has manages to blend action, comedy, and drama really well for the most part, but runs into a big issue later in the series. Specifically at the very end of the series where they try to give you a really heart wrenching scene that is meant to make you cry your eyes out, but ends up just creating a massive plot hole. With that being said, there still are some really well done emotional moments in Angel Beats!, but the show ending with an unresolved plot hole takes away from the emotional build up the show had created.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this series is really well done. The backgrounds and characters are varied, and well animated, and the actions scenes look great, and are entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in Angel Beats! is fantastic. They fit the mood and atmosphere of the scenes that they are used in not only because of the style of the music, but because the music itself feels emotional. When they want you to feel happy or sad, the music enhances that feeling, and makes those moments even more impactful. The singing on these emotional songs is phenomenal, and enhances the mood it\u2019s trying to convey. A majority of the songs feel sad and gloomy. Even some of the more upbeat and fast paced songs are sort of depressing, and that isn\u2019t a bad thing. It shows that even during the happy moments there is always an underlying layer of sadness, and I think that the sound is a good mirror of the atmosphere of the show as a whole. The sound it also complimented by a amazing opening, and an ending, that even though it\u2019s not anywhere near as good as the opening, was still enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are something I really wish Angel Beats! would\u2019ve spent more time developing. The main character is Otonashi, who arrives in their purgatory with amnesia, but regains his memories later on in the series. This provides him with a solid backstory, and some good development. But, there are very few characters in this series that get anywhere near as much information or development as Otonashi does. Angel Beats! has a large cast of supporting characters that you learn almost nothing about during the entire series. Which is definitely a shame, because when we did get information about the characters pasts, it was really well done. It explains why they are stuck in this world that they are in, and shows us why they behave and act they way that they do. If Angel Beats! had provided us with more information on the other characters it would\u2019ve made the series a lot more interesting and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this series both times through. Even though the second time around the comedy wasn\u2019t as funny, and the emotional moments weren\u2019t as impactful, it was still very enjoyable. Also, the good animation and sound help to make this series even more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict & Breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3.5/5\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 3.9/5\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4.5/5\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3.4/5\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3.9/5\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: 3.8/5\\n\\n\r\nAngel Beats! is a good series that suffers from it\u2019s short episode count. I honestly think that if it had around 24 episodes, to develop all of the characters and mend plot holes, it could\u2019ve been something special.",
