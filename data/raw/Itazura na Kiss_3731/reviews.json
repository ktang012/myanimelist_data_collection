            "content": "Shoujo romance can be a bit of an annoying genre for me.  First it is dominated by bishounen love interests who often look more like girls and usually have aloof or abrasive personalities that make you wonder why the heroine fell in love with them in the first place.  While at first glance, Itazura na Kiss may not seem to be any different (though with the relieving lack of bishies) it evolved before my very eyes into the most heartwarming romance I have seen to date.\r\nThe plot for Itazura na Kiss is no different than your standard shoujo romance.  A plain andstupid, but cute girl Kotoko has fallen in love and secretly pined for school idol and uber smart Naoki Irie.  She finally gathers to courage to write him a love confession letter but he flatly refuses to even accept or let alone read it stating that he doesn\u2019t like \"stupid\" girls.  Of course in a plot twist that can only happen in shoujo, Kotoko's house is destroyed due to faulty construction and she and her father are forced to move in with his old friend, who just happens to be Naoki's father!  Hilarity and hijinks ensue.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the fairly non groundbreaking premise the story remains quite funny.  Kotoko tries desperately to get her feelings across despite Naoki being cold, uninterested, and mean to her.  Though some of it walks to line of being unforgivable to my feminist brain, it never has some of the cruel or absolutely mean spirited feeling as I am accustomed to seeing in this genre.  But what really sets Itazura's story apart is the eventual payoff to the romance.  Yes I know this is going to be a shocking spoiler, but Kotoko and Naoki end up together!  Omigosh really!  Before some of you get upset at me for revealing that, honestly what did you expect!?  \\n\\n\r\nWhat we get in Itazura is something we almost never see in romance; the AFTER in they lived happily ever after.  Most romances evolve over the space of at most a year or two where in Itazura the years pass as we see our couple evolve and move on to each new stage of their life.  The formulaic romance plot evolves into a bit of a slice of life over the last half of the series.  But what is truly beautiful is seeing the characters and even the supporting characters grow and fine love and happiness themselves.  It\u2019s quite refreshing to see the spurned love rivals actually can be happy and not spend their lives pining away for an unattainable love.  My only real gripe with this is that the extra romances themselves play out too similarly to the main storyline.  I mean come on everyone does not fall in love the same way you know!\\n\\n\r\nKotoko makes for a very satisfying shoujo heroine.  She has all the attributes that one would expect.  She is cute but not overly beautiful, ditzy and clumsy, and not very bright.  What she lacks in intelligence she makes up for in determination, hard work, and a singular focus on getting her man.  This is where Itazura differs from a lot of shoujo.  Our ordinary girl is not surrounded by a harem of pretty boys and while others vie for her love, too her credit her feelings for Naoki never waver.  However as loveable and likeable as Kotoko is, you can\u2019t help but wonder what it is she sees in Naoki who is so cold and mean to her.  This is my main gripe usually with shoujo as I think it sets a bit of a bad role model for girls who thinks is ok to put up with this kind of thing.  Even though she succeeds and manages to get her well deserved reward, you have to wonder why she bothered with him in the first place.  Additionally, despite her pursuit of her man there is little else of substance about her.  You don\u2019t feel like she has any real dreams of her own beyond her relationship with Naoki.  It also annoyed me a bit that even after becoming intimate she still referred to him as Irie-kun.  All that being said, seeing Kotoko grow up and experience all the joy and happiness life has to offer brought a smile to my face and a few tears.\\n\\n\r\nOur stoic and cold hearted love interest Naoki certainly isn\u2019t the kind of guy I would fall for, but he has all of the attributes that young girls dream about.  He is handsome (yet thankfully not a bishie), smart, the son of a company president, and of course admired by women and men alike.  His is cold and aloof to everyone and while they at times touch on why this is they sadly never develop this part of his personality very well.  He does make a lot of growth in his character over the course of the series, though annoyingly he often reverts back to his old ways in the following episode.  But by the end of the series you feel as though he has become an acceptable human being.  And to think it only took Kotoko 10 years to get that out of him!\\n\\n\r\nAny romance would not be complete without the supporting cast of \"cockblockers\".  There always has to be girls and boys who spring out of the woodwork to try and derail our leads happy romance.  Itazura is no different however thankfully we get a cast of supporting characters who break the mold a bit and never seem to outstay their welcome and know when to move on when they have been defeated.  There are no real villains in the cast and you will end up liking every one of them and feel all the more happy when they find loves of their own.\\n\\n\r\nEvery heroine needs a cast of helpful supporters encourages her romantic struggle.  The series has some good ones, the biggest cheerleader and most humorous being Naoki's own mother who actively supports Kotoko in wooing her son, scolds him when he is mean to her, and loves her as her own daughter.  It is quite sweet.  The cast gets quite large towards the end and sadly some favorites tend to fade away into obscurity but you don\u2019t miss them too much because they all are so wonderful to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation is quite good.  As I mentioned most shoujo series seem to revolve around bishie male characters which we do not get in this series.  All the guys look like men, at least the ones that are supposed to be manly.  There is some inconsistency at times with the look overall, particularly Kotoko who sometimes looks a bit too childish.  The art itself is a bit plain too, by design but the settings, backgrounds, color palette, and character designs are not going to really blow anyone away.  The music score is outstanding however.  I really loved the EN theme and the performance from Kotoko seiyuu Nana Mizuki who is a favorite of mine and is probably best known as the voice of Fate from Nanoha.\\n\\n\r\nItazuka na Kiss comes close to receiving a perfect score.  From a pure enjoyment standpoint alone it surpasses it.  This series rivals my love for series with developed post confession romances such as Clannad.  While is has a few minor annoyances overall this is the best and most enjoyable romance series I have seen.  If your love your romance that\u2019s lite on the tragedy and gives you a heartwarming happy ending then this should be at the very top of your list.\\n",

            "content": "*sigh*\r\nThis is one of the most annoying romance animes I\u2019ve ever watched. Now either hit the \u201cnot helpful\u201d button or keep reading to find out why. \r\nStory 3:\r\nI chose to start InK because I heard it broke with the romance genre\u2019s stale tradition of ending with a high school rooftop kiss, and instead actually followed the characters into their adult lives. \r\n InK\u2019s longitudinal narrative style was the one positive thing that I can say about this train wreck of an anime (that and its surprisingly accurate use of medical jargon).\r\nThis anime is about Kotoko, a ditzy, klutzy, dimwitted, high school girl, and her one-sidedpursuit of her school\u2019s super-perfect heart throb, Irie. The central conflict revolves around Kotoko\u2019s struggle to get Irie\u2019s attention and to get past his incredibly cold personality. You see, Irie, in addition to being good at everything he does, is a complete douchebag and sees Kotoko as nothing more than an annoying flea.\\n\r\nThe narrative goes from high school to college to graduate school to working life. Unfortunately, despite spanning over 10 years, neither the characters nor the storyline ever matures. By episode 20 the characters are largely indistinguishable from their younger HS selves in episode 1. The humor is based almost exclusively around how bad Kotoko is at everything she does. As you can imagine this gets irritating pretty quickly. \\n\\n\r\nArt 6: Fair\\n\\n\r\nSound 6: Nothing special either way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 2:\\n\r\nEverything about the characters was awful. They were awful as individuals and they were awful as couples. The side characters were little more than plot stick figures. Everything was awful.\\n\\n\r\nKotoko lacks just about every trait that a decent woman should have. She has no autonomy, no pride, no self-respect, no brains, no talent, and no ambition. Well that\u2019s not true, she has ambition. Her sole ambition in life is to get the attention of her high school crush\u2026 an attraction based on infatuation rather than anything substantive. That\u2019s about it. She\u2019s willing to endure being humiliated, hit, bullied, and insulted by Irie because well, it\u2019s Irie-kun and he\u2019s way out of her league anyway. Basically, she should be thankful for whatever she can get\u2026it\u2019s really that simple. She sends out the wonderful message to young girls that if you just try hard enough with a guy who treats you like shit, you too can spend the best years of your life in an emotionally abusive relationship. I got the eerie feeling early on that if Irie decided to give her a black eye or some broken bones she\u2019d find a way to blame herself for it. I felt pity for Kotoko throughout the series more than hope or encouragement.\\n\r\nIrie: In addition to being a major tool, Irie is one of the most emotionally vacant anime characters I\u2019ve seen. Stoic characters can be great but they have to have some substance. Irie was just too robotic to really connect with.  The whole detached genius thing got old pretty quickly. His character development was severely stunted too. \\n\\n\r\nRelationships: All of the relationships in this anime lacked chemistry and most were severely cringe worthy. Now, there is something innately charming about a romance where two \u2018opposites attract\u2019\u2014Beauty and the beast, Romeo and Juliet, B Gata H Kei lol. However, InK\u2019s writer took that concept overboard and turned it into \u2018complete incompatibility attracts.\u2019 This is stupid and creates an environment where any character can fall in love with any character for no god damn reason. You\u2019ve hated someone for 15 episodes? No problem, just have an abrupt, out of the blue declaration of undying love to them in episode 16. You\u2019ve just met someone? No problem, get love struck and rearrange your whole life to accommodate them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3:\\n\r\nThis was painful to watch and I had to take several hiatuses from the series. The only thing that kept me going was the solemn duty to write a scathing review so others could be spared my misery. You\u2019re all welcome.",

            "content": "Would you just back down after being told no? To be honest, very few anime make me want to actually write a review about them. This is one of the rare exceptions. I have never seen such a beautiful, but also realistic story. However, there was a myriad of things beautiful about the anime outside of the story.\r\nThe score for this anime was beautiful, not as much as one would had liked, but they did a very good job with this. The art style also stuck true to the manga written back in 1991, which I also appreciate. However, enough of that, let's get onto why I believe this may be one of the greatest romance anime's of all time.\\n\\n\r\nWhen one watches an anime, usually it is the same thing over and over. You see the guy chasing the girl, and the girl chasing the guy, and at the very end they share an intimate moment and the anime will end. What happens to the couple after? Do they stay together? Get married? Or end up in a situation that end unfortunately? What is left for the viewer? \\n\\n\r\nItazura na Kiss shows exactly what the viewer wants to see. It shows not only Kotoko's attempt to persevere, but also the unlikely relationship between the two. It boldly does something that a lot of anime does not do and that's actually show the after affect of the couple. And I believe this is done beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nItazura na Kiss makes you feel what the other character is feeling, makes you think what the other character is thinking. I didn't expect much going into this, I thought it would be just another girl chasing a guy and being annoying like a plethora of anime leads are. This is easily one of the most enjoyable anime's I have watched to date. Each anime has it's flaws, no doubt about it. However, story wise, it was simply perfect. You didn't see a character automatically shift from being nefarious to being a perfect character. That doesn't happen here, Kotoko and Irei stay true to themselves throughout the whole anime and that's what is most enjoyable about it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, a 9/10. If you are into romance anime or simply want to take a break from your preferred genre like I did, this is a perfect anime to watch and just feel happy about while watching it.",

            "content": "The reason I chose to watch this anime was because it seemed to be highly recommended by others, so I feel like it is partly my duty to give a differing point of view since I really didn't like this anime at all. \r\nThis shoujo comedy centers on Kotoko, a character who is nothing new to the genre: pretty, but not too pretty, stupid, determined, feminine and someone whose whole being revolves around the guy she likes. Unfortunately the guy she happens to like is mean-spirited when he's not being completely indifferent towards her, rude (and of course incredibly good-looking), arrogant (and also the smartestperson in school without even trying), a complete jerk (who is capable of doing anything he puts his mind to including sports). It never becomes quite clear how it is anyone could fall in love with him beyond his looks and top exam scores, but we're also not supposed to believe that our female protagonist is so shallow as to only want him for his outwardly appearance and therefore it doesn't ever seem to make sense how she could love him so much when he treats her so poorly. As we become aware of Kotoko's strong will and determination when it comes to all things to do with getting her guy, we are also left puzzled by the fact that she doesn't use it to make more of herself independently of him.\\n\\n\r\nI forced myself to sit through this anime till the end no matter how bad it was so that I could form a justified opinion on it, I was also perhaps hoping that Kotoko would come to her senses, realise she could do better and dump the guy. But instead we have a character who singularly focuses her life around a man who never truly respects her. \\n\\n\r\nI should be fair by saying that this anime did elicit a few chuckles and it starts off amusing enough. The artwork is fairly average. There are quite a few decent secondary characters who keep the plot moving forward and who are a main source of comedic value. But as the anime progresses the main problem I've outlined above becomes a glaring impediment to enjoying the protagonists' romance.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this anime to anyone who likes to see their female characters with an ounce of self-respect, but if you want light-hearted romance and you don't mind what sort of message it conveys about and to girls and women, then by all means watch Itazura no Kiss.",

            "content": "ItazuraCrap is of all the anime I have seen the one I detest the most. Sure, there are tons of stupid, annoying, brainless shows out there but this one exists in a craptastic category of its own. There is so much wrongness stuffed behind the mask of a cute shojo that it makes me want to get myself into a Tardis and erase every sign of this anime ever having been created. Let's dissect the wrongness\u2026\r\nStory:\r\nThe story kicks off clich\u00e9d to the n(th) degree: plain, ditzy girl is unrequitedly in love with the School Prince\u2122. Now, this kind of setting can be charming given thecorrect ingredients: the right characters and the right dynamic between them. Far from being a good recipe, this anime requires an enema after viewing. The first few episodes were predictable enough in that the girl got her face shoved in the mud and suffered through lots of expectable humiliation. However, I was looking forward to the time when she would pick herself up, grow as a person and win the affections of her love interest. Respectively, I was expecting the love interest to stop being a jerk and show that he was actually a good enough person for the heroine. Instead, I got an S&M show. The heroine could not get enough humiliation and outright abuse, even at a point in the story where you'd think she'd get some love and affection. The love interest was such an abusive, unlikeable, insufferable asshole he only needed a Nazi uniform to make him complete. Honestly, if any viewer actually believes he is the ideal love interest then s/he is in desperate need of psychiatric evaluation and should not be allowed to care for small pets or children. \\n\r\nAbout the only positive thing I have to say for the story is that it moves fast. For the shojo genre it moves at warp speed 9 since it moves past high school and college and professional life. I suppose it shows more but I didn't make it past episode 15 so I wouldn't know. Nor would I want to know. I\u2019d rather unclog my toilet. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nKotoko: this is the kind of non-role model people should steer their kids away from. She has no self-respect, no life, no goals outside of loving the Jerk. I kid you not, she is a pushover and a doormat like no other. She even chooses her career only to complement the career the Jerk has chosen. She suffers untold humiliations and abusive behaviour because \u201cshe loves him\u201c. Her only purpose in life is to love the Jerk? I wish I could put her head to the meat grinder and feed her to my cat. Then her life would have a better purpose. \\n\r\nThe Jerk: has a name but I'm not going to use it. He's just the Jerk. He's supposed to be very pretty and very smart, so smart in fact that he has the supergenius ennui flu and views the rest of humanity on the same level as cockroaches. His \u201clove interest\u201d included. At no point does he become someone we can root for. You know, someone a girl in her right mind would actually love or even like. I wish I could put his head to the meat grinder and feed him to my cat but I\u2019m afraid she\u2019d just vomit him up. \\n\\n\r\nBy no means is this relationship the only problematic relationship in this anime. Throughout the show we have the message that boys should \u201csmack their bitch up\u201d and that the only good woman is the woman that is submissive to her man (re: total doormat). If you look closely, you'll see that any female character that is not a doormat (or does something against the wishes of her man) is portrayed as an evil bitch from hell. Honestly, I've seen hentai with healthier relationship portrayal. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nBelow shojo mediocrity\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIt\u2019s there. \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\nLighten up, I hear you say, this is just a romcom. No, it's not a comedy. It's a mean, sadistic piece of shit. You're not laughing because what you see is funny, you're laughing because you see a character being humiliated. And it's about as romantic as child brides. \\n\r\nSeriously, if you still can\u2019t spot the shit compare this turd with romcoms like Skip Beat and Lovely Complex. \\n",

While the art may seem weird to some, this anime really does stay true to the original manga.\r\nThis version of Aihara Kotoko is prettier and while still not the sharpest tool in the shed is more tolerable than the manga version.

            "content": "Be warned, this review may contain /spoilers/.\r\nAihara Kotoko is in love with the unattainable Irie Naoki. Fate intervenes when one day Kotoko\u2019s house gets ruined by an earthquake, forcing Kotoko and her father to move in to Naoki and his parents\u2019 house. Does Kotoko have a chance with Naoki after all? The romantic comedy begins! Itazura na Kiss is one of those few anime that go past the main couple\u2019s high school life and transcends into their adult life \u2013 their marriage, honeymoon, and university/college experiences. The manga which this anime is based off of is unfinished due to the tragic, untimely death of theauthor. It is said that the anime ended the way the author truly wanted it to finish.\\n\\n\r\nOh my gooood. This is such a beautiful anime. The relationship with Naoki and Kotoko is wonderfully developed, and it\u2019s so heartwarming and beautiful and I love it. I would love to have a husband like Naoki \u2013 he\u2019s my dream man, you know \u2013 and this is an anime that every person should watch because it\u2019s so beautiful. I had tears in my eyes during the last few episodes, it was that lovely.\\n\\n\r\nLOL NO.\\n\\n\r\nExcuse me while I rip this crap to pieces.\\n\\n\r\nItazura na Kiss (\u201cMischievous Kiss\u201d in English, or ItaKiss as it is commonly known) is not the best love story ever. It is also not romantic in the least. Unless, of course, you\u2019re a masochist. If you want a good love story, go watch\u2026hmmm\u2026I actually don\u2019t watch too many romance anime. Ah, I know. Go watch Kimi ni Todoke, or Wolf and Spice, or Fruits Basket, or even Toradora!. Heck, even School Rumble is a better romance than this. I think I need my brain checked, because /I don\u2019t understand why this anime has so many followers and girls screaming \u201coh my god I love Itazura na Kiss!\u201d/ Please, someone help me understand why this anime is so popular. Seriously \u2013 if you Google \u201cItazura na Kiss anime review\u201d (or even a manga review) over 98% of reviews are positive. /And I don\u2019t understand./\\n\\n\r\nWow, I\u2019m so pissed off that I can\u2019t even write this review in the way I originally intended. So let\u2019s go straight to the good stuff, shall we? Itazura na Kiss\u2019s female protagonist is Aihara Kotoko, who is one of the stupidest students in her high school \u2013 no joke, she\u2019s been in class \u201cF\u201d (the lowest class) all throughout high school. Unfortunately, the guy she likes is Irie Naoki, the most intelligent boy in school (a TENSAI!!1one! or genius) who happens to be in class \u201cA\u201d, which is the highest class. Naoki also happens to be a total jerk. None of their personalities change throughout the series, which goes on for twenty-five torturous episodes. I\u2014I can\u2019t even get a good synopsis out because I hate this anime so much, ughh. I promise that once I regain my composure, I\u2019ll try to write a \u201credux\u201d of this review.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode seventeen is when the anime actually starts to get good. For no other reason than they introduce Kamogari Keita. Ahh, Keita, you are the only reason I actually kept watching this anime. No joke. Keita is probably the best character in this entire series, if you ask me. For reasons that I will leave to you to find out, if you ever want to check out this anime. Actually \u2013 I\u2019ll spare you the pain of doing that. Keita happens to be the only character (that I can remember, anyway) that tells Kotoko to break it off with Naoki because he\u2019s a bastard that doesn\u2019t care about her. You should have listened to him, Kotoko. I\u2019m disappointed you didn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nOn the plus side, though, this anime has some psychological merits, even if it doesn\u2019t mean to have them. Kotoko is dumb as a rock, and Irie is a genius. Irie uses this blatant gap in their intelligence to use Kotoko and keep her with him, mainly utilizing the carrot-and-stick method. Based on this, we can conclude that Irie has a very low amount of self-esteem, and hides it by being with a stupid girl.",

            "content": "Itazura na Kiss is a Shoujo, Slice of Life, Romantic, Comedy about the unrequited love of our heroine, which slowly develops into true love. This concept is anything but original but this anime adaptation surely did the manga justice.\r\nHere we have the typical shoujo set-up of the average girl (Kotoko Aihara) that has a crush on the school idol (Naoki Irie), but he doesn&rsquo;t feel the same way towards her. So she makes it her goal to find a way to unlock the door to his heart. This premise is kind of dull on the other hand the whole living together, due to some unforeseencircumstances, thing does help matters progress in an interesting way. Because of this, there are plenty of comedic moments; with only some that will make anyone laugh and surprising developments to add some much needed drama. Sadly a lot had to be sacrificed from the manga storyline to accommodate the limited number of episodes, resulting in numerous skips. So you can expect them to go from Middle School to College faster than in most school-based anime, however it&rsquo;s not like the romantic relationships progressed as fast. Most shoujo anime fans can still expect a rewarding experience with the story but not as much with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nKotoko is an annoyingly persistent, love struck girl. Naoki is like a male tsundere, always cold and manipulative but later becomes more kind-hearted; and sure some of his actions are very normal but his attitude can get very annoying. Having these two as the main hero &amp; heroine is a fairly common sight, making the characters a fairly dull aspect of the series. At least there&rsquo;s an interesting batch of supporting characters to enjoy and the characters in general undergo surprising amounts of development. Well even though the supporting characters do bring with them a fair amount of comedy &amp; developments, some can become such a nuisance, with all their meddling.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is adapted from a fairly old manga (early 90s) and the animation style adopts it well. The surroundings, character designs and their outfits go well with the theme but this also comes with several unappealing factors (weird head shapes). The watercolour backgrounds do help to add depth to the foreground, but the cheesy shoujo effects don&rsquo;t always go with it. The music also comes with its ups and downs. The OP &amp; ED themes are great but you can&rsquo;t really say the same about the mundane soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Itazura na Kiss isn&rsquo;t an outstanding shoujo romance nevertheless it is still a great series to watch, with a rewarding end result. Personally I had one major problem with the story and that had to be with the pacing, which felt very disjointed at times but that was a necessity to cram in as much manga story as possible. Even though I didn&rsquo;t like most of the characters, it was still good to see them develop and grow as the story progressed. There was plenty of drama in throughout the series but this is a Rom/Com at heart and it never lets you forget that.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "This review does contain spoilers. \r\nAs you can see, I did not rate this anime very highly at all. I actually stumbled across this because I wanted something \u201chappier\u201d and \u201ccuter\u201d to watch as I\u2019d just finished a really deep intense anime. I am actually quite partial to romance anime and have watched some of the big ones such as Ef: A Tale of Memories, Clannad, Kanon, Air, etc. \r\nThis anime is not happy. It is not cute. It is sadistic.\r\nThe Recommendations list compares Itazura na Kiss to Clannad After Story which is by far one of my favourite animes. This is mostly due tothe fact that the story itself continues after high-school and into future life. That is where the similarities stop. This is NOTHING like Clannad \u2013 it is not deep, it is not well thought out and though it might be sad, it is sad for the wrong reasons.\\n\\n\r\nI actually got over half-way through the anime till I realised that I genuinely could not continue. As a woman, Kotoko\u2019s stupidity in love offended me and Irie\u2019s cold and disgusting nature made my skin crawl. Of course, I\u2019m perfectly fine with everyone else\u2019s opinions and I have seen many 9 and 10 ratings for this anime but here are my thoughts on the matter:\\n\\n\r\nStory \u2013 5\\n\r\nAs I mentioned above, I have watched over half way through the anime and I enjoyed it to begin with. The story was amusing and the characters were fun. At first.  I did notice that Irie was cold but I thought \u201cHey, maybe there is a reason for this and they can build on it later\u201d so I continued. No. Not at all because it only gets worse and as the relationship between Kotoko and Irie began to grow, I began to get more and more disgusted with the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 5\\n\r\nI actually quite like Kotoko \u2013 she is funny and sweet and seems genuinely caring. However, I cannot forgive her masochistic love for Irie. \u201cOh he\u2019s kissed me so he must really love me.\u201d Let\u2019s be fair to her, she does try to move on but Irie then miraculously decides that he loves her and MUST have her. However it makes me very sad that she can actively overlook his cold and cruel nature and only make his \u201ccute\u201d actions important.\\n\\n\r\nI despise Irie \u2013 I cannot find one redeeming thing about his nature. He is a genius but only because he has a photographic memory and not because he works hard. He doesn\u2019t love Kotoko \u2013 even when their relationship inevitably blossomed, he is still cruel to her. I found myself praying that the anime would do something spectacular and Kotoko would fall for someone else, leaving Irie in the dust. No such thing happens. \\n\\n\r\nI mean really, is that the sort of relationships that people want? A man who is cruel to the woman they love. Humiliates her in public for his own pleasure. Kisses her when she wants to get over him and then pretty much tells her \u201cTry to get over me now.\u201d It is cruel but Itazura na Kiss doesn\u2019t seem to focus on how cruel it is and only that Kotoko loves him because he\u2019s so \u201ccool\u201d. Really? Is cool all that matters?\\n\\n\r\nDespite being disappointed in the two main characters, there were actually a lot of redeeming characters who I did love and were the main characters not so unlikeable, I may have stuck to this longer. Honourable mentions go to Irie\u2019s mother, who is a particularly fun character in parts, and \u201cKin-chan\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nKin-chan \u2013 Kin-chan was actually my surprise favourite in this anime. I didn\u2019t expect to like him but he loved Kotoko for who she was \u2013 no matter if she was stupid or not, he would love her. He wanted to be with her and \u201cmake her smile\u201d. I would have been happy if Kotoko had run off into the sunset with Kin-chan and restoring my faith in women.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve noticed a lot of reviews are happy that Irie and Kotoko stay true to themselves and that their personalities do not alter but this relationship is seriously flawed. I could not invest in it like I could in Clannad or Kanon where the romance literally brought me to tears. There was no fangirling from Ayu or Nagisa that I noticed and yet Kotoko\u2026 Urgh, just no. Please find a man who loves you for who you are and does not judge you on your intelligence.\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 6\\n\r\nIt was a pretty average art style. Pretty but nothing particular special. I liked some of Kotoko\u2019s outfits and felt that she was always cute and colourful.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 6\\n\r\nI wasn\u2019t fussed on any of the opening or ending songs but the music throughout was pretty good and fit well with the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 5\\n\r\nWhile there were parts of this anime that made me giggle, more so for the first few episodes as the anime progressed, I realised that I was wasting time. I would rather rewatch Clannad or Kanon where at least I can feel that it \u2013is- a romance and I can invest in the relationship. These shows show men who treat their women well and love them for who they are no matter what. It was painful to watch and this is someone who happily sat through School Days despite hating the main guy. Unlike the guy in School Days, it does not seem like Irie is going to get what\u2019s coming to him. If you want real romance, look elsewhere.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Fun premise with some genuinely humorous and touching moments, but tries to cram too much story into too few episodes, severely undermining the character development and romance that should be two of the show's star attractions.  Irie's characterization suffers most from the compression -- every show of affection comes off as random and perfunctory, seeming less like the result of his feelings for Kotoko than the show meeting a necessary benchmark so it can move on to the next phase of the Irie/Kotoko relationship.  (Not surprisingly, Kotoko herself comes off as a bit of a doormat early on, given that she suffers somuch abuse with so few rewards.)  When your main couple is two people with opposite personalities who don't get along well at first, putting their relationship on fast forward is just a bad idea.\\n\\n\r\nStill, there are good reasons to hang on till the end of Itakiss: the supporting cast is full of entertaining characters, the show has a great sense of humor when it's not being warped out of shape by time constraints, the art scheme manages to be old-fashioned without looking dated, and perhaps most importantly, the pacing and character development become much better around the halfway mark.  That's crucial, because whenever Itakiss gets a little breathing room, it becomes more rich, more fun -- becomes, in effect, the charming romantic comedy it always had it in it to be.  (Rather awkwardly, the show's potential is most apparent in the final episode, an amusing side story told in flashback that does nothing to advance the romantic plot.)\\n\\n\r\nThere are worse ways to fail than from an excess of ambition, and I find the second half of Itazura na Kiss more or less redeems its shaky start.  It isn't always great, but it's never truly bad, and it gets better as it goes.  If you like shoujo romance and can give a show the benefit of the doubt, give Itakiss a shot.",

            "content": "This anime has ONE thing to say:\r\nIt is okay for a woman to be treated like trash, be constantly bullied, abused, rejected and belittled by her romantic interest. A woman should worship a man who has more respect for trash than for her, and her sole purpose in life should be to serve, idolize, and love him. As long as she continues to love him despite his utter lack of respect for her character, she will get a happy ending, because even though the man will always treat her as inferior piece of shit, he will eventually love her back. Kind of.  \r\nKotoko's relationshipwith Irie is the epitome of an unhealthy, verbally abusive, unbalanced relationship. Irie completely controls, dominates, and constantly abuses Kotoko. He treats her worse than shit - he probably has more respect for the gum at the bottom of his shoe than he does for her. And yet she fawns over him, idolizes and loves him all the same? I'm sorry, but I wouldn't even consider dating a guy who called me \"stupid\", and Irie does much worse than that yet she pines after him. I can't stand these character types and relationships at all. \\n\\n\r\nKotoko is a cheerful, happy-go-lucky, sweet girl who is stupid, clumsy, useless and submissive. She gets absolutely terrible grades, but it's okay because she's pretty, cute, nice and cheerful! Actually, I didn't mind Kotoko being an absolute failure of a human being. What I hated was that she  worshiped a man who went out of his way to abuse and belittle her daily. Who constantly called her dumb, annoying, stupid, useless and a failure. Kotoko is a nice girl who works hard, and I appreciated that she proved a point that working hard matters more than intelligence, because despite being naturally dumb, with hard work she got into the top of her class.\\n\\n\r\nWhat DOES bother me is that Irie, her abusive object of affection, is the sole purpose she actually tries to do better in school. She becomes a nurse just so she can work close to him. I'm sorry, but that's the incentive she has for doing a job that deals with SAVING LIVES? NO. NO. Irie did not encourage and inspire her to want such a hard but rewarding career. In fact, he didn't believe she could do it and didn't go to her graduation. The fact is, Kotoko only lives to serve, love, worship, and follow Irie, who treats her like a wet piece of paper at best. And that's depressing, sexist, and wrong in more ways that I care to count.  \\n\\n\r\nIf you don't mind an unhealthy, abusive relationship where the female is constantly belittled, has the emotional intelligence of a four year old, bows down and bends over backwards to the wants and needs of a selfish, cruel, arrogant, and abusive bully who dares to call himself a man, then by all means, watch this.",

            "content": "Itazura na Kiss is about a girl who is not so bright but very determined who falls in love with a verytalented and supposedly \"way above her league\" guy.The story follows the trials and tribulations that she goes through in her relationship with him.\r\nI liked the story of this anime very much because it is one of the few animes that actually go so far as to follow the relationship of the couple after their marriage. this makes it different from most animes which just end the story when the two confess to each other or something along that line. However, a warning to allthat the story line is somewhat predictable and may bore you in terms of plot.  The focus on the relationship makes the main genre of the story romance, which i think is portrayed very well in the show, along with the comedy making the show a fairly enjoyable romantic comedy. Another thing to note is that the story moves at an extremely fast pace from high school to college and then work. This may prove unrealistic but it allows us to see the progress in the relationship between the characters and can be overlooked.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was your typical shuojo style of animation with big eyes and the &quot;cool&quot; looking guys. It will not meet the standards of artworks like Fate stay night or True Tears(two animes that i also recommend). The style fits the genre of a romantic comedy which is more comical and lighthearted.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was suited the anime with catchy and meaningful (lyrics) songs for the OP and ED. The inserts were also timed nicely to bring out the atmosphere at key points in the story and thus there is still actually some drama and in fact more so than your ordinary romantic comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all have a good deal of depth where most of the characters even the supporting ones have some showtime dedicated to them and thus the focus will not all be hogged by the main characters, this helps to create a more interactive environment for the main characters(more than one couple in the show). I think the characters are truly hysterical at times and is not overdone, thus you still can take the story seriously while getting a good laugh out of it.\\n\\n\r\nI must say the combination of romance-drama-comedy make this anime very entertaining and enjoyable to watch. If you are a looking for a good romance anime with a bit of drama then this anime is for you. The anime is not too dull and will liven up your heart. Romantic moments are abundant in this show so if you love those nice cheesy romance or watching the hard work ploughed into relationships bearing fruit then you will like this. However, as mentioned earlier it can be quite predictable but hey sometimes the most ordinary things can be entertaining with a tweak of comedy added and a good cast of characters to liven the show. This is a romantic comedy at it's best.",

            "content": "Oooooookkkk...\r\nLet me start off by saying, I had *high* expectations for this. I had about 4 or more friends tell me that \"Itazura na Kiss is beautiful! It's exactly like Clannad: After Story! I'm sure you'd LOVE it!\"\r\nSorry, but what is there to love? And how the dang flying crap is it in ANY WAY like Clannad: After Story? HOW? I don't see the similarity at all! Most of the time I wanted to vomit because of how utterly gross this idiotic junk was.\r\nStory~\r\nUghhhhh... more cliche romance. This is why I dislike romance-- it's very annoying to me. Mainly because the only ones I canfind are crappy ones like this. It's soooo stereotypical... A girl falls in love with some random guy for no reason, and spends the rest of her life chasing him for no reason, then he pretends to like her for no reason, and he tells himself he likes her for no reason, but then he acts like a total jerk and treats her as royalty would treat a convict. There's nothing more to say... That's all the story has to it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt~\\n\r\nOK, it was fine, I admit. It was sorta cute, and the movement in some scenes was better than others. It was good where it needed to be, and Irie didn't look like one of those weird girly-guys... I think. XD So yes, the art was fine, but all in all, it's just...average. I guess.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound~\\n\r\nWait, there was soundtrack? Where? I had no idea! Wow! Anyway, since I didn't even notice it, I won't give it a good or bad review-- it was just... there. Or was it? Erm, I'm sure it was. Just... I totally didn't see. I was too focused on the utter stupidity of every moment that frankly, I didn't hear or even care.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter~\\n\r\nIf there was a 0, I'd choose it. The characters in Itazura na Kiss are just AWFUL. Hate me for giving a \"bad review\", but it's my opinion and it won't change. Forgive me if I sort of compare to Clannad characters here, but I was referred to this FROM Clannad: After Story in the first place, so I'll point out why this anime is inferior garbage compared to the beautiful masterpiece that is Clannad.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, in Clannad, Tomoya is loving and only cares for Nagisa... but not in a stupid way. He just wants to support and help her. He can get... over-excited, but he's kind and caring.\\n\r\nNow, onto Irie-- he DOESN'T care. No matter how much he claims to love poor pathetic Kotoko, it just won't work. Love shows itself. Irie doesn't even show any. He just kisses her one moment, tells her he loves her, then ignores her and verbally abuses her (and occasionally physically) for the next few weeks. Then we get a tiny \"romantic\" moment only for him to return to his normal jerk self. He DOESN'T care for Kotoko, he DOESN'T love her, he DOESN'T only want to help and support her and make her happy. I'm not sure if he's incredibly and unbelievably naive (if he's THAT naive, maybe he's a robot) or if he's sadistic. This whole show is watching Irie make fun of his \"beloved\", and then he tries to convince himself he loves her, which he does not. This is REALLY annoying and makes me want to brutally murder him with many different weapons.\\n\\n\r\nNext... ok sorry for comparing Clannad but ok. Nagisa is sweet, yet a little strange, but is actually believable. She loves Tomoya but not in a fangirly \"I MUST DAYDREAM ABOUT HIM ALL DAY\" thing.\\n\r\nThe previous statement is Kotoko's entire life. All she does is sit and \"fangirl\" over a guy who doesn't even care, a guy who has nothing good about him, a guy who would rather read a book or go... somewhere than talk to his so-called \"beloved\". Her entire life revolves around a cold, cruel, abusive man with nothing good about him. She just sits there with unrequited love for YEARS, until he \"pretends\" to accept her later on. And then she remains exactly the same. Fangirly, stupid, ditzy, uncaring-- without a BRAIN in her HEAD. I think she's masochist! She's not even believable, in any way. I'm a girl, but do I sit and stare at my crush while blushing, dreaming, and my entire life revolves around impressing him? NO. Nor do I know ANYONE like that in the whole world. If there is anyone like that, she's been watching too much of this crappy show. \\n\r\nI mean really. Kotoko thinks about this useless guy through the entire series, and nothing else... ever. One day, she begins searching for a career, and I finally thought, \"WOOT! There's something ELSE on her mind for once!\" Then, 2 seconds later, I realize she's pursuing that career just to be by her \"beloved's\" side. FAIL.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is a disgusting show that didn't provide an ounce of enjoyment for me, ever. It teaches that all girls should be entirely devoted to a guy, no matter how much he abuses you. Honestly? Woooow... Being devoted is great, but only to a good guy, not a complete rusted, smelly, awful, old garbage tin. There's a time when girls need to realize to GET UP and MOVE ON, because there are better, non-abusive guys out there.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I'm embarrassed, I laugh, loudly, and turn away from the situation, flustered at how embarrassed I am. That's the ONLY time this show ever made me laugh-- it was never because it was funny. No, not ONCE. It's because it embarrassed me so dang much I could have exploded.\\n\\n\r\nI should have probably finished the show before reviewing it, but nah.\\n\r\nI got 2 minutes into episode 20 (because in episode 19, there was a hint that Irie might become a better person at some point) so I continued. But then he reverted to our neighborhood ignoring, idiotic guy, and with that, I exploded. I give up. And no matter how you try to convince me otherwise I will keep the opinion I have of this sexist, stupid, pointless, PAINFUL show.",

            "content": "The series has just ended, and I can finally deem myself worthy enough to write a review. But beware spoilers after the first paragraph! \r\nWhat is Itazura na Kiss exactly? Probably the most amazing, wonderful, and romantic anime you will ever find. The story follows Kotoko, a cute and spunky girl who, though she is not book smart, is makes up for it in personality traits that a normal human could not possess. Kotoko is the girl everyone who has failed a class wants to be, the girl that gets kicked around by those smarter and more attractive than herself, but who is able toignore all of these things because of her strong will and determination. \\n\r\nAt the beginning, we are introduced to not only Kotoko but Irie-kun, the most intelligent and attractive student in, well, Japan. He is so scarily intelligent and good looking that it is only natural he shuns every girl who professes her love to him. And so naturally, when Kotoko, who has had her eye on Irie for years, tries to give him a love letter, he refuses it. Normally, for any girl, this is where the story would end, but for Kotoko it is only the beginning. After a series of unfortunate events, Kotoko and her father end up in Irie's home. And so begins the story of Itazura na Kiss. Kotoko is put through many trials as she tries to show Irie that she loves him, and living with him and having his AMAZINGLY AWESOMELY HILARIOUS MOTHER on her side is a huge help!\\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot to the story that if I said a lot more it would just spoil it, so I'm going to say this at least: Watch Itazura na Kiss. It's hilarious but the love story is one of the most amazing and romantic ones you will ever find. Kotoko will remain one of my favorite characters of all time because through her hard work and determination to win the one that she loves, she proves to everyone that you CAN have your happy ending and have everything you could possibly ever want. \\n\\n\r\nART: The art may seem a little off, but they tried to stick to the original character designs by Kaoru Tada, who died in the process of writing the manga for it. Episode 25 is scarily a lot like the manga in terms of art. Irie and Kotoko change after they get married...it's hard to put your finger on what is so different. But as the story processes the art seems to get a little sloppier. Other than that, I'm really glad they stuck to Kaoru Tada's original design for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Sound is good. Kotoko has a really cute voice, Irie rarely talks so his is not as important. It's Irie's mother that is so amazing, her laugh is the PERFECT &quot;oh ho ho!&quot; laugh.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: Like I said, you'll never find another like Kotoko. And it's really sweet to see how Irie changes the more that Kotoko affects him and makes him think and wonder about his life, and about how he feels about her. Hands down though, Irie's mother is the best character though. She plays so many tricks to get Kotoko--the daughter she never had--to have her way, and tries to steer Irie along into her trap. She is forceful and hilarious and brings most of the comedy into the VERY sarcastic series.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: I was of course very happy watching the series. Filler episodes tend to get annoying, but you're just dying to see what Irie will do next in the earlier episodes. There is a lot that isn't covered in the series that you should know about Irie. I highly suggest reading the manga or at least checking out the Wikipedia article on Itazura na Kiss. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Best anime ever. It was totally amazing, and it doesn't matter WHAT you're genre is: Mecha, Shoujo, Shonen, etc. Just watch Itazura na Kiss. It's the anime that falls into it's own genre because it is so amazing. ARIGATO KAORU TADA FOR YOUR CREATION!!!",

            "content": "Somewhat spoiler-free review:\r\nSeeing the high score on MAL made me think this was going to be a good Shojou Romance. I was in for a rude awakening with this one. As I have lived in Japan for over a decade, I know full well the patriarchal dominance and chauvinism of a good portion of male citizens. Naoki is nothing more than a pretty face hiding a terrible persona. Kotoko is mentally subdued by him throughout the entirety of the show. He treats her terribly 99% of the time. He mentally and emotionally abuses her. When he realizes he is losing his hold on her ata myriad of times, he uses flashy words or phrases to manipulate her into running back into his arms. He treats her like a tool to keep himself at ease with little care for her feelings until the last few episodes where he just slightly cares due to her situation (trying not to spoil too much). Many viewers were calling him a tsundere. He isn't. He is just a toxic male persona. The entire time watching all I could think of was actions speak louder than words. As I said, he used a lot of flashy wordage, but he rarely used action as proof. Naoki's family and Kotoko's father were all oblivious to the terrible way he treated her (save for his mother who sometimes got upset, but not enough for Naoki to care). They also added to the issues by not taking her feelings into account for a majority of the show. *Slight Spoiler* The biggest failure was Kotoko's father sitting down with Naoki at one point for a friendly chat about why she ran away near the end half of the series due to Naoki's treatment of her. He put his own daughter down while talking about how she is similar to his wife and even sympathized with Naoki having to deal with it. A real father would chew him out for treating his daughter like a cold-hearted jerk, not stroll down memory lane. *End Spoiler* This is definitely not an anime for kids who can't use logic when viewing as it sets a bad example of how one should act in relationships. As for the other characters they all have many terrible personas. From people only loving someone based off looks, trying to steal other people's lovers, trying to cheat (honeymoon episode), being creepy, or going as far as forcing themselves onto other characters, this is not a show worth enjoying. There are plenty of beautiful Shoujou and non-Shoujou Romance anime out there worth your time. Unless you really want to watch this to see how disgusting people can be, I advise finding something better.\\n\\n\r\nI found the whole story to be very cringy at best due to everything I stated above. Hence the pathetic score. The art was slightly old-school which I don't mind, but the elongated chins were odd looking. Hence the fair score. The sound was fine. Characters... It's what really drove home the terrible nature of this anime. While there was progression for everyone, most of their personas stayed the same disgusting shade. Hence dreadful. I didn't get much enjoyment out of it, but I never drop anime and watched it until the end. Overall, it was not worth it. Please don't be fooled by the score.",

            "content": "\"Love isn\u2019t blind. It\u2019s retarded.\" \u2013 Charlie, Two and a Half Men\r\nWhat happens when the unstoppable force meets the immovable object? Love blossoms, of course! Itazura na Kiss is the anime adaptation of the smash hit manga of the same name that published in the late 1990s. However, due to the sudden death of the mangaka, Karou Tada, the manga never reached its intended climax. After the release of three successful live action series (and another later in 2010), TMS Entertainment decided to conceptualize the ending and produce a 25 episode anime series. \r\nItazura na Kiss follows Kotoko, a naive and clumsy girl who fallshead over heels for the brilliant and handsome Naoki. Unfortunately for her, he is the king of all tsunderes and refuses to even cast a second glance at her. After Kotoko\u2019s house is destroyed due to some silly reason, she is forced to move into (*gasps*) Naoki\u2019s house. The rest of the story is dedicated to Kotoko\u2019s pursuit of her Prince Charming and the struggles on how a relationship might not always but be milk and roses, especially if the girl\u2019s a klutz and the guy\u2019s heart is made of stone.\\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat, it has to be mentioned that Itazura stands out mainly because of telling the tale even after the couple unite. Seeing that this is a shoujo, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m bursting anyone\u2019s bubble here. In fact, that is the selling point of this anime \u2013 it has a story even after the much awaited confession and acceptance. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of this anime is like a very bumpy road trip \u2013 it\u2019s rough, rutted and will frustrate, but when it\u2019s good, it\u2019s a real joy. At the core, this show is a rom-com and delivers well to a decent extent on both ends. Shoujo enthusiasts will be delighted to see their most beloved clich\u00e9s wrapped into a well executed package. The plot twists are steep enough to keep most guessing and although it can test one\u2019s patience with cheesy dialogues, there isn\u2019t a single moment in this anime that will make you bored. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Itazura\u2019s story is, as mentioned a few lines ago, extremely patchy. This can be attributed to the overdose of comic relief, which serves as a total mood crusher. Just when the show has a good rapport going with the viewer, plunging its tendrils into our hearts, it immediately barricades itself with its corny sense of humor and excessive chibi. It fails to take itself seriously. Moments that have so much potential to be moving and memorable are completely underutilized because of the anime\u2019s inability to be consistent with the mood. Now, the jokes are good and will give you a good chuckle or two, but they soon grow to be as annoying as a weight machine next to an all-you-can-eat buffet. It\u2019s a good thing that the show steps up its game episode 18 upwards, from where things are far more consistent and gripping. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire concept of love and romance in the anime (like many generic shoujo) is twisted. According to Itazura rules, people are like Pokemon \u2013 you gotta capture them. The one who has just a one-sided crush becomes madly in love with the other person and become delirious to all reason and logic.  They will instantly abandon all their dignity and self-esteem. \u201cLove\u201d here is more or less synonymous with \u201cstalking\u201d. Love someone? Confess to them, follow them and pester them until they finally give in. But this approach is what kept the chemistry between the leads, so it is forgivable.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very mediocre. Despite being a 2008 anime, the backgrounds are average and the detailing is so-so. My major gripe here is the terrible consistency in Kotoko\u2019s face. For comedic effects, they stretch her face until she looks like a pancake and the next second she looks like a mature teenager with beautiful flowing hair. Lots of facepalm-worthy moments. There were some nice touches, like the changing of hairstyles and a decent variation of clothes, which is something that most anime tend to neglect. Overall, it\u2019s a decent job by the animation department, nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very standard with only a couple of pieces standing out. It\u2019s fitting and is never a hindrance or a pleasure. The OP was nothing special and the first ED was a threat to my eardrum\u2019s safety. The second one, on the other hand, was a marvelous track and had great vocals.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the biggest offenders here. No, not all of them, just the one \u2013 Kotoko. While there is nothing wrong with having a clumsy girl, her simplicity often amounts to her acting like a three year old. Whether this maybe for forcing a smile or a \u201ckawai\u201d outcry, her flawed character is irritating. She lacks any self-esteem whatsoever and her childish antics can only be tolerated so much before you throw your hands up in exasperation. Her masochism is pretty high up the chart even for those usual suffer-in-silence shoujo female leads.\\n\\n\r\nNaota on the other hand is a fantastic character. The aim of any character is to provoke a reaction from the viewer, be it is positive or negative. Naoki does the latter admirably, generating a lot of hate for his tsunderity and strong willed single-mindedness. He manages to retain your attention for every second of his air time. The rest of the cast all play their role and there are a lot of recurring ones excluding the family. Plenty of new characters are thrown into the mix along the way and they are always welcome additions.\\n\\n\r\nLike the story, the enjoyment will be in bits and pieces as well. One must have a, how shall I say it, wide sense of humor in order to relish the anime\u2019s weak, yet persistent, sense of humor.  The initial episodes will have you tearing up with laughter, but as the show progresses, the charm wears off. It fails to move away from the same and washed out slapstick jokes and the end result is a viewer grudgingly getting past these \u201cfiller\u201d scenes waiting for the real deal. And the real deal, the romantic scenes, is quite a spectacle. Every time a truly serious situation arises, the chemistry between the arrogant Adonis and the diligent dame does not disappoint. Those looking for the lovey-dovey atmosphere with a touch of class will find exactly what they are looking for in this anime. There are some exceptionally memorable scenes which will make your heart swoon for the couple. This is especially so in the latter half of the series, when the anime (along with the characters) matures.\\n\\n\r\n[ THE WRAP-UP ]\\n\r\nItazura na Kiss is a fantastic anime for those looking for a light hearted rom-com that will entertain more than anything else. TMS Entertainment has done a great job in condensing the pioneering decade-long manga into a well executed 25 episode series. The place where this anime severely lacks is in consistency, largely due to the fact that the humor was shallow and the same jokes were used one too many times. The heartwarming romance is present, but is heavily underplayed and could definitely have been so much more emotional. The animation and sound departments are average and are nothing special. The lead couple is a total yin and yang and while it does make for an enjoyable chemistry, Kotoko is a horrendously flawed character and can be beyond irritating at times. Itazura na Kiss is recommended if you\u2019re looking for something that will cheer you up, while satisfying the shoujo void in your heart and providing a great \u201cafter story\u201d, but just don\u2019t go in expecting anything too deep.",

            "content": "Spoilers. Probably. Not really. There is definitely spoilers in this review. \r\nNOTE: HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO REWATCH THIS ANIME IF YOU HAPPENED TO SEE MY COMMENT AND YOU ALREADY LEFT A COMMENT WITH HIGH MIGHTY RATING AGES AGO.\r\nWell, well, well, well I rated this anime 7 back then when I was a child. I thought I should re-watch this after reading the synopsis and was clearly dumbfounded that I actually liked this anime. Was I masochist  or am I just plainly ignorant back then?\r\nStory and Character\r\nAlright, the MC girl is a stupid, clumsy, masochist, dimwit, silly, idiot, klutzy-- wait, did I just use interchangeable wordsexcessively? You damn right I did. I cannot fathom her attitude at all. She's like the god of stupidity and masochism because all she did is offer her life to a sadist wannabe man who clearly thinks she is a piece of shit (probably worse than that). The guy? I don't think he's a man at all, I don't even categorize him as human. If you want to know whether both characters improved throughout the anime, I can guarantee you that they did not. The only good part about this anime is how the story revolves around them; how she chases him, them finally being a couple, graduating school, working, getting married and actually having a child. They are infuriating to watch but I have to see what I liked about this anime back then. In the end, I just cannot deal the fact that this anime is just plain garbage. I think I lose half of my life by just realizing how the characters force a relationship despite the lack of chemistry, respect or even humanity. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIf there is a fantastic anime out there, this one tops the craptastic anime of all time for me. It leaves a bitter taste in my mouth and as much as I want to rate it 1, I have to give it 2 for the sake of my childhood life. Man, if you still want to give this a good rating, I salute you for appreciating the horrendous opposite attract shenanigans. Oh wait, I don't even think he is attracted to the girl at all. \\n\\n\r\nAgain: RECOMMEND TO RE WATCH AND RE EVALUATE YOUR SCORE FOR THIS ANIME IF YOU HAPPENED TO RATE THIS FROM 7-10 SCORE. I am trying to save your soul.",

            "content": "Itazura na Kiss, or \"Mischievous Kiss\", does start out as a typical romantic comedy of Kotoko Aihara having a crush on Naoki Irie for a long time. When Kotoko gathers enough courage to give Naoki a love letter on her 18th birthday, he flat out refuses to accept it. That is when the stereotype of romantic comedy takes a nice detour. \r\nAside from the synopsis that I gave above, Kotoko is pretty much an airhead when it comes to most things where as Naoki seems to be able to do almost anything set in fromt of him. Actually, Naoki said \"I can probably do about90% of all things in the world. But the other 10% I can't do, she does better than anyone.&quot; But that's getting to far ahead of ourselves. Their personalities couldn't be further apart either. Kotoko is a lively, daydreaming, hopeless romantic and Naoki is a cold, aloof, almost arrogant guy. And Kotoko seems to be in love with him.\\n\\n\r\nAfter some of bad mishaps with Kotoko and her father, fate it seems, threw the main characters together since Kotoko and Naoki's fathers knew each other since they were kids. Pretty farfetched, but I'll run with it. Then come on the one-sided love from Kotoko that slowly (I mean slowly) brings Naoki into the realm of loving her bit-by-bit. That and she blackmailed him in the beginning with some embarassing pictures of Naoki as a baby, from his own mother. Sheesh.\\n\\n\r\n(Beware of reading on at this point, SPOILER ALERT!!!)\\n\\n\r\nThe exceptional part of this anime is that the story goes far beyond the high school life. It even goes well beyond college. That is what gave it a worthy anime. It doesn't just stick into the high school life like a lot of anime goes through. College, medical school, even their marriage is shown. A nice way of bringing what we most want to see in the love story animes of our time. Of course ther are a few flaws.\\n\\n\r\nTime jumps for example do happen in the anime. But it is not without consideration that the manga does go through some filler where the anime does not. Interesting that the Director wanted to do that. Usually it is the other way around. But there is some more flaws to be had. The fact that Kotoko and Naoki's wedding happened 2 weeks after their engagement threw me off, but it was explained that the mom had in fact, planned everything to happen. Funny how the mom is a brilliant schemer. And when you see Kotomi finally born, you don't really see a lot of character development on the last episode, or even if Kotoko and Naoki wanted another child. Speaking of which, when they do have their child, they still live with Naoki's parents. They are around 30 at the time. Don't you think that they should move out by now?\\n\\n\r\nBut flaws aside, it is still worth watching. Character development, sound and story does have great qualities and is well thought out. The artwork on some scenes kind of seemed childish, but that is what was intended so I let it slide. Altogether, a good story to behold. Not a &quot;Must See&quot;, but definately worth checking out a couple of episodes to see your interest.",

            "content": "Shoujo romance can be a bit of an annoying genre for me.  First it is dominated by bishounen love interests who often look more like girls and usually have aloof or abrasive personalities that make you wonder why the heroine fell in love with them in the first place.  While at first glance, Itazura na Kiss may not seem to be any different (though with the relieving lack of bishies) it evolved before my very eyes into the most heartwarming romance I have seen to date.\r\nThe plot for Itazura na Kiss is no different than your standard shoujo romance.  A plain andstupid, but cute girl Kotoko has fallen in love and secretly pined for school idol and uber smart Naoki Irie.  She finally gathers to courage to write him a love confession letter but he flatly refuses to even accept or let alone read it stating that he doesn\u2019t like \"stupid\" girls.  Of course in a plot twist that can only happen in shoujo, Kotoko's house is destroyed due to faulty construction and she and her father are forced to move in with his old friend, who just happens to be Naoki's father!  Hilarity and hijinks ensue.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the fairly non groundbreaking premise the story remains quite funny.  Kotoko tries desperately to get her feelings across despite Naoki being cold, uninterested, and mean to her.  Though some of it walks to line of being unforgivable to my feminist brain, it never has some of the cruel or absolutely mean spirited feeling as I am accustomed to seeing in this genre.  But what really sets Itazura's story apart is the eventual payoff to the romance.  Yes I know this is going to be a shocking spoiler, but Kotoko and Naoki end up together!  Omigosh really!  Before some of you get upset at me for revealing that, honestly what did you expect!?  \\n\\n\r\nWhat we get in Itazura is something we almost never see in romance; the AFTER in they lived happily ever after.  Most romances evolve over the space of at most a year or two where in Itazura the years pass as we see our couple evolve and move on to each new stage of their life.  The formulaic romance plot evolves into a bit of a slice of life over the last half of the series.  But what is truly beautiful is seeing the characters and even the supporting characters grow and fine love and happiness themselves.  It\u2019s quite refreshing to see the spurned love rivals actually can be happy and not spend their lives pining away for an unattainable love.  My only real gripe with this is that the extra romances themselves play out too similarly to the main storyline.  I mean come on everyone does not fall in love the same way you know!\\n\\n\r\nKotoko makes for a very satisfying shoujo heroine.  She has all the attributes that one would expect.  She is cute but not overly beautiful, ditzy and clumsy, and not very bright.  What she lacks in intelligence she makes up for in determination, hard work, and a singular focus on getting her man.  This is where Itazura differs from a lot of shoujo.  Our ordinary girl is not surrounded by a harem of pretty boys and while others vie for her love, too her credit her feelings for Naoki never waver.  However as loveable and likeable as Kotoko is, you can\u2019t help but wonder what it is she sees in Naoki who is so cold and mean to her.  This is my main gripe usually with shoujo as I think it sets a bit of a bad role model for girls who thinks is ok to put up with this kind of thing.  Even though she succeeds and manages to get her well deserved reward, you have to wonder why she bothered with him in the first place.  Additionally, despite her pursuit of her man there is little else of substance about her.  You don\u2019t feel like she has any real dreams of her own beyond her relationship with Naoki.  It also annoyed me a bit that even after becoming intimate she still referred to him as Irie-kun.  All that being said, seeing Kotoko grow up and experience all the joy and happiness life has to offer brought a smile to my face and a few tears.\\n\\n\r\nOur stoic and cold hearted love interest Naoki certainly isn\u2019t the kind of guy I would fall for, but he has all of the attributes that young girls dream about.  He is handsome (yet thankfully not a bishie), smart, the son of a company president, and of course admired by women and men alike.  His is cold and aloof to everyone and while they at times touch on why this is they sadly never develop this part of his personality very well.  He does make a lot of growth in his character over the course of the series, though annoyingly he often reverts back to his old ways in the following episode.  But by the end of the series you feel as though he has become an acceptable human being.  And to think it only took Kotoko 10 years to get that out of him!\\n\\n\r\nAny romance would not be complete without the supporting cast of \"cockblockers\".  There always has to be girls and boys who spring out of the woodwork to try and derail our leads happy romance.  Itazura is no different however thankfully we get a cast of supporting characters who break the mold a bit and never seem to outstay their welcome and know when to move on when they have been defeated.  There are no real villains in the cast and you will end up liking every one of them and feel all the more happy when they find loves of their own.\\n\\n\r\nEvery heroine needs a cast of helpful supporters encourages her romantic struggle.  The series has some good ones, the biggest cheerleader and most humorous being Naoki's own mother who actively supports Kotoko in wooing her son, scolds him when he is mean to her, and loves her as her own daughter.  It is quite sweet.  The cast gets quite large towards the end and sadly some favorites tend to fade away into obscurity but you don\u2019t miss them too much because they all are so wonderful to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation is quite good.  As I mentioned most shoujo series seem to revolve around bishie male characters which we do not get in this series.  All the guys look like men, at least the ones that are supposed to be manly.  There is some inconsistency at times with the look overall, particularly Kotoko who sometimes looks a bit too childish.  The art itself is a bit plain too, by design but the settings, backgrounds, color palette, and character designs are not going to really blow anyone away.  The music score is outstanding however.  I really loved the EN theme and the performance from Kotoko seiyuu Nana Mizuki who is a favorite of mine and is probably best known as the voice of Fate from Nanoha.\\n\\n\r\nItazuka na Kiss comes close to receiving a perfect score.  From a pure enjoyment standpoint alone it surpasses it.  This series rivals my love for series with developed post confession romances such as Clannad.  While is has a few minor annoyances overall this is the best and most enjoyable romance series I have seen.  If your love your romance that\u2019s lite on the tragedy and gives you a heartwarming happy ending then this should be at the very top of your list.\\n",

            "content": "*sigh*\r\nThis is one of the most annoying romance animes I\u2019ve ever watched. Now either hit the \u201cnot helpful\u201d button or keep reading to find out why. \r\nStory 3:\r\nI chose to start InK because I heard it broke with the romance genre\u2019s stale tradition of ending with a high school rooftop kiss, and instead actually followed the characters into their adult lives. \r\n InK\u2019s longitudinal narrative style was the one positive thing that I can say about this train wreck of an anime (that and its surprisingly accurate use of medical jargon).\r\nThis anime is about Kotoko, a ditzy, klutzy, dimwitted, high school girl, and her one-sidedpursuit of her school\u2019s super-perfect heart throb, Irie. The central conflict revolves around Kotoko\u2019s struggle to get Irie\u2019s attention and to get past his incredibly cold personality. You see, Irie, in addition to being good at everything he does, is a complete douchebag and sees Kotoko as nothing more than an annoying flea.\\n\r\nThe narrative goes from high school to college to graduate school to working life. Unfortunately, despite spanning over 10 years, neither the characters nor the storyline ever matures. By episode 20 the characters are largely indistinguishable from their younger HS selves in episode 1. The humor is based almost exclusively around how bad Kotoko is at everything she does. As you can imagine this gets irritating pretty quickly. \\n\\n\r\nArt 6: Fair\\n\\n\r\nSound 6: Nothing special either way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 2:\\n\r\nEverything about the characters was awful. They were awful as individuals and they were awful as couples. The side characters were little more than plot stick figures. Everything was awful.\\n\\n\r\nKotoko lacks just about every trait that a decent woman should have. She has no autonomy, no pride, no self-respect, no brains, no talent, and no ambition. Well that\u2019s not true, she has ambition. Her sole ambition in life is to get the attention of her high school crush\u2026 an attraction based on infatuation rather than anything substantive. That\u2019s about it. She\u2019s willing to endure being humiliated, hit, bullied, and insulted by Irie because well, it\u2019s Irie-kun and he\u2019s way out of her league anyway. Basically, she should be thankful for whatever she can get\u2026it\u2019s really that simple. She sends out the wonderful message to young girls that if you just try hard enough with a guy who treats you like shit, you too can spend the best years of your life in an emotionally abusive relationship. I got the eerie feeling early on that if Irie decided to give her a black eye or some broken bones she\u2019d find a way to blame herself for it. I felt pity for Kotoko throughout the series more than hope or encouragement.\\n\r\nIrie: In addition to being a major tool, Irie is one of the most emotionally vacant anime characters I\u2019ve seen. Stoic characters can be great but they have to have some substance. Irie was just too robotic to really connect with.  The whole detached genius thing got old pretty quickly. His character development was severely stunted too. \\n\\n\r\nRelationships: All of the relationships in this anime lacked chemistry and most were severely cringe worthy. Now, there is something innately charming about a romance where two \u2018opposites attract\u2019\u2014Beauty and the beast, Romeo and Juliet, B Gata H Kei lol. However, InK\u2019s writer took that concept overboard and turned it into \u2018complete incompatibility attracts.\u2019 This is stupid and creates an environment where any character can fall in love with any character for no god damn reason. You\u2019ve hated someone for 15 episodes? No problem, just have an abrupt, out of the blue declaration of undying love to them in episode 16. You\u2019ve just met someone? No problem, get love struck and rearrange your whole life to accommodate them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3:\\n\r\nThis was painful to watch and I had to take several hiatuses from the series. The only thing that kept me going was the solemn duty to write a scathing review so others could be spared my misery. You\u2019re all welcome.",

            "content": "Would you just back down after being told no? To be honest, very few anime make me want to actually write a review about them. This is one of the rare exceptions. I have never seen such a beautiful, but also realistic story. However, there was a myriad of things beautiful about the anime outside of the story.\r\nThe score for this anime was beautiful, not as much as one would had liked, but they did a very good job with this. The art style also stuck true to the manga written back in 1991, which I also appreciate. However, enough of that, let's get onto why I believe this may be one of the greatest romance anime's of all time.\\n\\n\r\nWhen one watches an anime, usually it is the same thing over and over. You see the guy chasing the girl, and the girl chasing the guy, and at the very end they share an intimate moment and the anime will end. What happens to the couple after? Do they stay together? Get married? Or end up in a situation that end unfortunately? What is left for the viewer? \\n\\n\r\nItazura na Kiss shows exactly what the viewer wants to see. It shows not only Kotoko's attempt to persevere, but also the unlikely relationship between the two. It boldly does something that a lot of anime does not do and that's actually show the after affect of the couple. And I believe this is done beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nItazura na Kiss makes you feel what the other character is feeling, makes you think what the other character is thinking. I didn't expect much going into this, I thought it would be just another girl chasing a guy and being annoying like a plethora of anime leads are. This is easily one of the most enjoyable anime's I have watched to date. Each anime has it's flaws, no doubt about it. However, story wise, it was simply perfect. You didn't see a character automatically shift from being nefarious to being a perfect character. That doesn't happen here, Kotoko and Irei stay true to themselves throughout the whole anime and that's what is most enjoyable about it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, a 9/10. If you are into romance anime or simply want to take a break from your preferred genre like I did, this is a perfect anime to watch and just feel happy about while watching it.",

            "content": "The reason I chose to watch this anime was because it seemed to be highly recommended by others, so I feel like it is partly my duty to give a differing point of view since I really didn't like this anime at all. \r\nThis shoujo comedy centers on Kotoko, a character who is nothing new to the genre: pretty, but not too pretty, stupid, determined, feminine and someone whose whole being revolves around the guy she likes. Unfortunately the guy she happens to like is mean-spirited when he's not being completely indifferent towards her, rude (and of course incredibly good-looking), arrogant (and also the smartestperson in school without even trying), a complete jerk (who is capable of doing anything he puts his mind to including sports). It never becomes quite clear how it is anyone could fall in love with him beyond his looks and top exam scores, but we're also not supposed to believe that our female protagonist is so shallow as to only want him for his outwardly appearance and therefore it doesn't ever seem to make sense how she could love him so much when he treats her so poorly. As we become aware of Kotoko's strong will and determination when it comes to all things to do with getting her guy, we are also left puzzled by the fact that she doesn't use it to make more of herself independently of him.\\n\\n\r\nI forced myself to sit through this anime till the end no matter how bad it was so that I could form a justified opinion on it, I was also perhaps hoping that Kotoko would come to her senses, realise she could do better and dump the guy. But instead we have a character who singularly focuses her life around a man who never truly respects her. \\n\\n\r\nI should be fair by saying that this anime did elicit a few chuckles and it starts off amusing enough. The artwork is fairly average. There are quite a few decent secondary characters who keep the plot moving forward and who are a main source of comedic value. But as the anime progresses the main problem I've outlined above becomes a glaring impediment to enjoying the protagonists' romance.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this anime to anyone who likes to see their female characters with an ounce of self-respect, but if you want light-hearted romance and you don't mind what sort of message it conveys about and to girls and women, then by all means watch Itazura no Kiss.",

            "content": "ItazuraCrap is of all the anime I have seen the one I detest the most. Sure, there are tons of stupid, annoying, brainless shows out there but this one exists in a craptastic category of its own. There is so much wrongness stuffed behind the mask of a cute shojo that it makes me want to get myself into a Tardis and erase every sign of this anime ever having been created. Let's dissect the wrongness\u2026\r\nStory:\r\nThe story kicks off clich\u00e9d to the n(th) degree: plain, ditzy girl is unrequitedly in love with the School Prince\u2122. Now, this kind of setting can be charming given thecorrect ingredients: the right characters and the right dynamic between them. Far from being a good recipe, this anime requires an enema after viewing. The first few episodes were predictable enough in that the girl got her face shoved in the mud and suffered through lots of expectable humiliation. However, I was looking forward to the time when she would pick herself up, grow as a person and win the affections of her love interest. Respectively, I was expecting the love interest to stop being a jerk and show that he was actually a good enough person for the heroine. Instead, I got an S&M show. The heroine could not get enough humiliation and outright abuse, even at a point in the story where you'd think she'd get some love and affection. The love interest was such an abusive, unlikeable, insufferable asshole he only needed a Nazi uniform to make him complete. Honestly, if any viewer actually believes he is the ideal love interest then s/he is in desperate need of psychiatric evaluation and should not be allowed to care for small pets or children. \\n\r\nAbout the only positive thing I have to say for the story is that it moves fast. For the shojo genre it moves at warp speed 9 since it moves past high school and college and professional life. I suppose it shows more but I didn't make it past episode 15 so I wouldn't know. Nor would I want to know. I\u2019d rather unclog my toilet. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nKotoko: this is the kind of non-role model people should steer their kids away from. She has no self-respect, no life, no goals outside of loving the Jerk. I kid you not, she is a pushover and a doormat like no other. She even chooses her career only to complement the career the Jerk has chosen. She suffers untold humiliations and abusive behaviour because \u201cshe loves him\u201c. Her only purpose in life is to love the Jerk? I wish I could put her head to the meat grinder and feed her to my cat. Then her life would have a better purpose. \\n\r\nThe Jerk: has a name but I'm not going to use it. He's just the Jerk. He's supposed to be very pretty and very smart, so smart in fact that he has the supergenius ennui flu and views the rest of humanity on the same level as cockroaches. His \u201clove interest\u201d included. At no point does he become someone we can root for. You know, someone a girl in her right mind would actually love or even like. I wish I could put his head to the meat grinder and feed him to my cat but I\u2019m afraid she\u2019d just vomit him up. \\n\\n\r\nBy no means is this relationship the only problematic relationship in this anime. Throughout the show we have the message that boys should \u201csmack their bitch up\u201d and that the only good woman is the woman that is submissive to her man (re: total doormat). If you look closely, you'll see that any female character that is not a doormat (or does something against the wishes of her man) is portrayed as an evil bitch from hell. Honestly, I've seen hentai with healthier relationship portrayal. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nBelow shojo mediocrity\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIt\u2019s there. \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\nLighten up, I hear you say, this is just a romcom. No, it's not a comedy. It's a mean, sadistic piece of shit. You're not laughing because what you see is funny, you're laughing because you see a character being humiliated. And it's about as romantic as child brides. \\n\r\nSeriously, if you still can\u2019t spot the shit compare this turd with romcoms like Skip Beat and Lovely Complex. \\n",

The flavor of the original story has stayed true with extra filler material cut out which paces the anime well. Keep in mind this manga began publishing in 1990. While the art may seem weird to some, this anime really does stay true to the original manga.\r\nThis version of Aihara Kotoko is prettier and while still not the sharpest tool in the shed is more tolerable than the manga version. Irie Naoki looksand acts just like he should. The best part about him is watching his gradual tenderness emerge. You can't help but like him more and more as the story progresses.\\n\\n\r\nI'll be updating once I'm done with the series. The manga was never completed due to the tragic, sudden death of the mangaka. The mangaka's husband was consulted on production of this anime. The ending will be as the mangaka originally intended.

Fate intervenes when one day Kotoko\u2019s house gets ruined by an earthquake, forcing Kotoko and her father to move in to Naoki and his parents\u2019 house. Does Kotoko have a chance with Naoki after all? The romantic comedy begins! Itazura na Kiss is one of those few anime that go past the main couple\u2019s high school life and transcends into their adult life \u2013 their marriage, honeymoon, and university/college experiences. The manga which this anime is based off of is unfinished due to the tragic, untimely death of theauthor. It is said that the anime ended the way the author truly wanted it to finish.\\n\\n\r\nOh my gooood. This is such a beautiful anime. The relationship with Naoki and Kotoko is wonderfully developed, and it\u2019s so heartwarming and beautiful and I love it. I would love to have a husband like Naoki \u2013 he\u2019s my dream man, you know \u2013 and this is an anime that every person should watch because it\u2019s so beautiful. I had tears in my eyes during the last few episodes, it was that lovely.\\n\\n\r\nLOL NO.\\n\\n\r\nExcuse me while I rip this crap to pieces.\\n\\n\r\nItazura na Kiss (\u201cMischievous Kiss\u201d in English, or ItaKiss as it is commonly known) is not the best love story ever. It is also not romantic in the least. Unless, of course, you\u2019re a masochist. If you want a good love story, go watch\u2026hmmm\u2026I actually don\u2019t watch too many romance anime. Ah, I know. Go watch Kimi ni Todoke, or Wolf and Spice, or Fruits Basket, or even Toradora!. Heck, even School Rumble is a better romance than this. I think I need my brain checked, because /I don\u2019t understand why this anime has so many followers and girls screaming \u201coh my god I love Itazura na Kiss!\u201d/ Please, someone help me understand why this anime is so popular. Seriously \u2013 if you Google \u201cItazura na Kiss anime review\u201d (or even a manga review) over 98% of reviews are positive. /And I don\u2019t understand./\\n\\n\r\nWow, I\u2019m so pissed off that I can\u2019t even write this review in the way I originally intended. So let\u2019s go straight to the good stuff, shall we? Itazura na Kiss\u2019s female protagonist is Aihara Kotoko, who is one of the stupidest students in her high school \u2013 no joke, she\u2019s been in class \u201cF\u201d (the lowest class) all throughout high school. Unfortunately, the guy she likes is Irie Naoki, the most intelligent boy in school (a TENSAI!!1one! or genius) who happens to be in class \u201cA\u201d, which is the highest class. Naoki also happens to be a total jerk. None of their personalities change throughout the series, which goes on for twenty-five torturous episodes. I\u2014I can\u2019t even get a good synopsis out because I hate this anime so much, ughh. I promise that once I regain my composure, I\u2019ll try to write a \u201credux\u201d of this review.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode seventeen is when the anime actually starts to get good. For no other reason than they introduce Kamogari Keita. Ahh, Keita, you are the only reason I actually kept watching this anime. No joke. Keita is probably the best character in this entire series, if you ask me. For reasons that I will leave to you to find out, if you ever want to check out this anime. Actually \u2013 I\u2019ll spare you the pain of doing that. Keita happens to be the only character (that I can remember, anyway) that tells Kotoko to break it off with Naoki because he\u2019s a bastard that doesn\u2019t care about her. You should have listened to him, Kotoko. I\u2019m disappointed you didn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nOn the plus side, though, this anime has some psychological merits, even if it doesn\u2019t mean to have them. Kotoko is dumb as a rock, and Irie is a genius. Irie uses this blatant gap in their intelligence to use Kotoko and keep her with him, mainly utilizing the carrot-and-stick method. Based on this, we can conclude that Irie has a very low amount of self-esteem, and hides it by being with a stupid girl.",

            "content": "Itazura na Kiss is a Shoujo, Slice of Life, Romantic, Comedy about the unrequited love of our heroine, which slowly develops into true love. This concept is anything but original but this anime adaptation surely did the manga justice.\r\nHere we have the typical shoujo set-up of the average girl (Kotoko Aihara) that has a crush on the school idol (Naoki Irie), but he doesn&rsquo;t feel the same way towards her. So she makes it her goal to find a way to unlock the door to his heart. This premise is kind of dull on the other hand the whole living together, due to some unforeseencircumstances, thing does help matters progress in an interesting way. Because of this, there are plenty of comedic moments; with only some that will make anyone laugh and surprising developments to add some much needed drama. Sadly a lot had to be sacrificed from the manga storyline to accommodate the limited number of episodes, resulting in numerous skips. So you can expect them to go from Middle School to College faster than in most school-based anime, however it&rsquo;s not like the romantic relationships progressed as fast. Most shoujo anime fans can still expect a rewarding experience with the story but not as much with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nKotoko is an annoyingly persistent, love struck girl. Naoki is like a male tsundere, always cold and manipulative but later becomes more kind-hearted; and sure some of his actions are very normal but his attitude can get very annoying. Having these two as the main hero &amp; heroine is a fairly common sight, making the characters a fairly dull aspect of the series. At least there&rsquo;s an interesting batch of supporting characters to enjoy and the characters in general undergo surprising amounts of development. Well even though the supporting characters do bring with them a fair amount of comedy &amp; developments, some can become such a nuisance, with all their meddling.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is adapted from a fairly old manga (early 90s) and the animation style adopts it well. The surroundings, character designs and their outfits go well with the theme but this also comes with several unappealing factors (weird head shapes). The watercolour backgrounds do help to add depth to the foreground, but the cheesy shoujo effects don&rsquo;t always go with it. The music also comes with its ups and downs. The OP &amp; ED themes are great but you can&rsquo;t really say the same about the mundane soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Itazura na Kiss isn&rsquo;t an outstanding shoujo romance nevertheless it is still a great series to watch, with a rewarding end result. Personally I had one major problem with the story and that had to be with the pacing, which felt very disjointed at times but that was a necessity to cram in as much manga story as possible. Even though I didn&rsquo;t like most of the characters, it was still good to see them develop and grow as the story progressed. There was plenty of drama in throughout the series but this is a Rom/Com at heart and it never lets you forget that.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "This review does contain spoilers. \r\nAs you can see, I did not rate this anime very highly at all. I actually stumbled across this because I wanted something \u201chappier\u201d and \u201ccuter\u201d to watch as I\u2019d just finished a really deep intense anime. I am actually quite partial to romance anime and have watched some of the big ones such as Ef: A Tale of Memories, Clannad, Kanon, Air, etc. \r\nThis anime is not happy. It is not cute. It is sadistic.\r\nThe Recommendations list compares Itazura na Kiss to Clannad After Story which is by far one of my favourite animes. This is mostly due tothe fact that the story itself continues after high-school and into future life. That is where the similarities stop. This is NOTHING like Clannad \u2013 it is not deep, it is not well thought out and though it might be sad, it is sad for the wrong reasons.\\n\\n\r\nI actually got over half-way through the anime till I realised that I genuinely could not continue. As a woman, Kotoko\u2019s stupidity in love offended me and Irie\u2019s cold and disgusting nature made my skin crawl. Of course, I\u2019m perfectly fine with everyone else\u2019s opinions and I have seen many 9 and 10 ratings for this anime but here are my thoughts on the matter:\\n\\n\r\nStory \u2013 5\\n\r\nAs I mentioned above, I have watched over half way through the anime and I enjoyed it to begin with. The story was amusing and the characters were fun. At first.  I did notice that Irie was cold but I thought \u201cHey, maybe there is a reason for this and they can build on it later\u201d so I continued. No. Not at all because it only gets worse and as the relationship between Kotoko and Irie began to grow, I began to get more and more disgusted with the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 5\\n\r\nI actually quite like Kotoko \u2013 she is funny and sweet and seems genuinely caring. However, I cannot forgive her masochistic love for Irie. \u201cOh he\u2019s kissed me so he must really love me.\u201d Let\u2019s be fair to her, she does try to move on but Irie then miraculously decides that he loves her and MUST have her. However it makes me very sad that she can actively overlook his cold and cruel nature and only make his \u201ccute\u201d actions important.\\n\\n\r\nI despise Irie \u2013 I cannot find one redeeming thing about his nature. He is a genius but only because he has a photographic memory and not because he works hard. He doesn\u2019t love Kotoko \u2013 even when their relationship inevitably blossomed, he is still cruel to her. I found myself praying that the anime would do something spectacular and Kotoko would fall for someone else, leaving Irie in the dust. No such thing happens. \\n\\n\r\nI mean really, is that the sort of relationships that people want? A man who is cruel to the woman they love. Humiliates her in public for his own pleasure. Kisses her when she wants to get over him and then pretty much tells her \u201cTry to get over me now.\u201d It is cruel but Itazura na Kiss doesn\u2019t seem to focus on how cruel it is and only that Kotoko loves him because he\u2019s so \u201ccool\u201d. Really? Is cool all that matters?\\n\\n\r\nDespite being disappointed in the two main characters, there were actually a lot of redeeming characters who I did love and were the main characters not so unlikeable, I may have stuck to this longer. Honourable mentions go to Irie\u2019s mother, who is a particularly fun character in parts, and \u201cKin-chan\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nKin-chan \u2013 Kin-chan was actually my surprise favourite in this anime. I didn\u2019t expect to like him but he loved Kotoko for who she was \u2013 no matter if she was stupid or not, he would love her. He wanted to be with her and \u201cmake her smile\u201d. I would have been happy if Kotoko had run off into the sunset with Kin-chan and restoring my faith in women.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve noticed a lot of reviews are happy that Irie and Kotoko stay true to themselves and that their personalities do not alter but this relationship is seriously flawed. I could not invest in it like I could in Clannad or Kanon where the romance literally brought me to tears. There was no fangirling from Ayu or Nagisa that I noticed and yet Kotoko\u2026 Urgh, just no. Please find a man who loves you for who you are and does not judge you on your intelligence.\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 6\\n\r\nIt was a pretty average art style. Pretty but nothing particular special. I liked some of Kotoko\u2019s outfits and felt that she was always cute and colourful.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 6\\n\r\nI wasn\u2019t fussed on any of the opening or ending songs but the music throughout was pretty good and fit well with the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 5\\n\r\nWhile there were parts of this anime that made me giggle, more so for the first few episodes as the anime progressed, I realised that I was wasting time. I would rather rewatch Clannad or Kanon where at least I can feel that it \u2013is- a romance and I can invest in the relationship. These shows show men who treat their women well and love them for who they are no matter what. It was painful to watch and this is someone who happily sat through School Days despite hating the main guy. Unlike the guy in School Days, it does not seem like Irie is going to get what\u2019s coming to him. If you want real romance, look elsewhere.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Fun premise with some genuinely humorous and touching moments, but tries to cram too much story into too few episodes, severely undermining the character development and romance that should be two of the show's star attractions.  Irie's characterization suffers most from the compression -- every show of affection comes off as random and perfunctory, seeming less like the result of his feelings for Kotoko than the show meeting a necessary benchmark so it can move on to the next phase of the Irie/Kotoko relationship.  (Not surprisingly, Kotoko herself comes off as a bit of a doormat early on, given that she suffers somuch abuse with so few rewards.)  When your main couple is two people with opposite personalities who don't get along well at first, putting their relationship on fast forward is just a bad idea.\\n\\n\r\nStill, there are good reasons to hang on till the end of Itakiss: the supporting cast is full of entertaining characters, the show has a great sense of humor when it's not being warped out of shape by time constraints, the art scheme manages to be old-fashioned without looking dated, and perhaps most importantly, the pacing and character development become much better around the halfway mark.  That's crucial, because whenever Itakiss gets a little breathing room, it becomes more rich, more fun -- becomes, in effect, the charming romantic comedy it always had it in it to be.  (Rather awkwardly, the show's potential is most apparent in the final episode, an amusing side story told in flashback that does nothing to advance the romantic plot.)\\n\\n\r\nThere are worse ways to fail than from an excess of ambition, and I find the second half of Itazura na Kiss more or less redeems its shaky start.  It isn't always great, but it's never truly bad, and it gets better as it goes.  If you like shoujo romance and can give a show the benefit of the doubt, give Itakiss a shot.",

            "content": "This anime has ONE thing to say:\r\nIt is okay for a woman to be treated like trash, be constantly bullied, abused, rejected and belittled by her romantic interest. A woman should worship a man who has more respect for trash than for her, and her sole purpose in life should be to serve, idolize, and love him. As long as she continues to love him despite his utter lack of respect for her character, she will get a happy ending, because even though the man will always treat her as inferior piece of shit, he will eventually love her back. Kind of.  \r\nKotoko's relationshipwith Irie is the epitome of an unhealthy, verbally abusive, unbalanced relationship. Irie completely controls, dominates, and constantly abuses Kotoko. He treats her worse than shit - he probably has more respect for the gum at the bottom of his shoe than he does for her. And yet she fawns over him, idolizes and loves him all the same? I'm sorry, but I wouldn't even consider dating a guy who called me \"stupid\", and Irie does much worse than that yet she pines after him. I can't stand these character types and relationships at all. \\n\\n\r\nKotoko is a cheerful, happy-go-lucky, sweet girl who is stupid, clumsy, useless and submissive. She gets absolutely terrible grades, but it's okay because she's pretty, cute, nice and cheerful! Actually, I didn't mind Kotoko being an absolute failure of a human being. What I hated was that she  worshiped a man who went out of his way to abuse and belittle her daily. Who constantly called her dumb, annoying, stupid, useless and a failure. Kotoko is a nice girl who works hard, and I appreciated that she proved a point that working hard matters more than intelligence, because despite being naturally dumb, with hard work she got into the top of her class.\\n\\n\r\nWhat DOES bother me is that Irie, her abusive object of affection, is the sole purpose she actually tries to do better in school. She becomes a nurse just so she can work close to him. I'm sorry, but that's the incentive she has for doing a job that deals with SAVING LIVES? NO. NO. Irie did not encourage and inspire her to want such a hard but rewarding career. In fact, he didn't believe she could do it and didn't go to her graduation. The fact is, Kotoko only lives to serve, love, worship, and follow Irie, who treats her like a wet piece of paper at best. And that's depressing, sexist, and wrong in more ways that I care to count.  \\n\\n\r\nIf you don't mind an unhealthy, abusive relationship where the female is constantly belittled, has the emotional intelligence of a four year old, bows down and bends over backwards to the wants and needs of a selfish, cruel, arrogant, and abusive bully who dares to call himself a man, then by all means, watch this.",

            "content": "Itazura na Kiss is about a girl who is not so bright but very determined who falls in love with a verytalented and supposedly \"way above her league\" guy.The story follows the trials and tribulations that she goes through in her relationship with him.\r\nI liked the story of this anime very much because it is one of the few animes that actually go so far as to follow the relationship of the couple after their marriage. this makes it different from most animes which just end the story when the two confess to each other or something along that line. However, a warning to allthat the story line is somewhat predictable and may bore you in terms of plot.  The focus on the relationship makes the main genre of the story romance, which i think is portrayed very well in the show, along with the comedy making the show a fairly enjoyable romantic comedy. Another thing to note is that the story moves at an extremely fast pace from high school to college and then work. This may prove unrealistic but it allows us to see the progress in the relationship between the characters and can be overlooked.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was your typical shuojo style of animation with big eyes and the &quot;cool&quot; looking guys. It will not meet the standards of artworks like Fate stay night or True Tears(two animes that i also recommend). The style fits the genre of a romantic comedy which is more comical and lighthearted.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was suited the anime with catchy and meaningful (lyrics) songs for the OP and ED. The inserts were also timed nicely to bring out the atmosphere at key points in the story and thus there is still actually some drama and in fact more so than your ordinary romantic comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all have a good deal of depth where most of the characters even the supporting ones have some showtime dedicated to them and thus the focus will not all be hogged by the main characters, this helps to create a more interactive environment for the main characters(more than one couple in the show). I think the characters are truly hysterical at times and is not overdone, thus you still can take the story seriously while getting a good laugh out of it.\\n\\n\r\nI must say the combination of romance-drama-comedy make this anime very entertaining and enjoyable to watch. If you are a looking for a good romance anime with a bit of drama then this anime is for you. The anime is not too dull and will liven up your heart. Romantic moments are abundant in this show so if you love those nice cheesy romance or watching the hard work ploughed into relationships bearing fruit then you will like this. However, as mentioned earlier it can be quite predictable but hey sometimes the most ordinary things can be entertaining with a tweak of comedy added and a good cast of characters to liven the show. This is a romantic comedy at it's best.",

            "content": "Oooooookkkk...\r\nLet me start off by saying, I had *high* expectations for this. I had about 4 or more friends tell me that \"Itazura na Kiss is beautiful! It's exactly like Clannad: After Story! I'm sure you'd LOVE it!\"\r\nSorry, but what is there to love? And how the dang flying crap is it in ANY WAY like Clannad: After Story? HOW? I don't see the similarity at all! Most of the time I wanted to vomit because of how utterly gross this idiotic junk was.\r\nStory~\r\nUghhhhh... more cliche romance. This is why I dislike romance-- it's very annoying to me. Mainly because the only ones I canfind are crappy ones like this. It's soooo stereotypical... A girl falls in love with some random guy for no reason, and spends the rest of her life chasing him for no reason, then he pretends to like her for no reason, and he tells himself he likes her for no reason, but then he acts like a total jerk and treats her as royalty would treat a convict. There's nothing more to say... That's all the story has to it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt~\\n\r\nOK, it was fine, I admit. It was sorta cute, and the movement in some scenes was better than others. It was good where it needed to be, and Irie didn't look like one of those weird girly-guys... I think. XD So yes, the art was fine, but all in all, it's just...average. I guess.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound~\\n\r\nWait, there was soundtrack? Where? I had no idea! Wow! Anyway, since I didn't even notice it, I won't give it a good or bad review-- it was just... there. Or was it? Erm, I'm sure it was. Just... I totally didn't see. I was too focused on the utter stupidity of every moment that frankly, I didn't hear or even care.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter~\\n\r\nIf there was a 0, I'd choose it. The characters in Itazura na Kiss are just AWFUL. Hate me for giving a \"bad review\", but it's my opinion and it won't change. Forgive me if I sort of compare to Clannad characters here, but I was referred to this FROM Clannad: After Story in the first place, so I'll point out why this anime is inferior garbage compared to the beautiful masterpiece that is Clannad.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, in Clannad, Tomoya is loving and only cares for Nagisa... but not in a stupid way. He just wants to support and help her. He can get... over-excited, but he's kind and caring.\\n\r\nNow, onto Irie-- he DOESN'T care. No matter how much he claims to love poor pathetic Kotoko, it just won't work. Love shows itself. Irie doesn't even show any. He just kisses her one moment, tells her he loves her, then ignores her and verbally abuses her (and occasionally physically) for the next few weeks. Then we get a tiny \"romantic\" moment only for him to return to his normal jerk self. He DOESN'T care for Kotoko, he DOESN'T love her, he DOESN'T only want to help and support her and make her happy. I'm not sure if he's incredibly and unbelievably naive (if he's THAT naive, maybe he's a robot) or if he's sadistic. This whole show is watching Irie make fun of his \"beloved\", and then he tries to convince himself he loves her, which he does not. This is REALLY annoying and makes me want to brutally murder him with many different weapons.\\n\\n\r\nNext... ok sorry for comparing Clannad but ok. Nagisa is sweet, yet a little strange, but is actually believable. She loves Tomoya but not in a fangirly \"I MUST DAYDREAM ABOUT HIM ALL DAY\" thing.\\n\r\nThe previous statement is Kotoko's entire life. All she does is sit and \"fangirl\" over a guy who doesn't even care, a guy who has nothing good about him, a guy who would rather read a book or go... somewhere than talk to his so-called \"beloved\". Her entire life revolves around a cold, cruel, abusive man with nothing good about him. She just sits there with unrequited love for YEARS, until he \"pretends\" to accept her later on. And then she remains exactly the same. Fangirly, stupid, ditzy, uncaring-- without a BRAIN in her HEAD. I think she's masochist! She's not even believable, in any way. I'm a girl, but do I sit and stare at my crush while blushing, dreaming, and my entire life revolves around impressing him? NO. Nor do I know ANYONE like that in the whole world. If there is anyone like that, she's been watching too much of this crappy show. \\n\r\nI mean really. Kotoko thinks about this useless guy through the entire series, and nothing else... ever. One day, she begins searching for a career, and I finally thought, \"WOOT! There's something ELSE on her mind for once!\" Then, 2 seconds later, I realize she's pursuing that career just to be by her \"beloved's\" side. FAIL.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is a disgusting show that didn't provide an ounce of enjoyment for me, ever. It teaches that all girls should be entirely devoted to a guy, no matter how much he abuses you. Honestly? Woooow... Being devoted is great, but only to a good guy, not a complete rusted, smelly, awful, old garbage tin. There's a time when girls need to realize to GET UP and MOVE ON, because there are better, non-abusive guys out there.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I'm embarrassed, I laugh, loudly, and turn away from the situation, flustered at how embarrassed I am. That's the ONLY time this show ever made me laugh-- it was never because it was funny. No, not ONCE. It's because it embarrassed me so dang much I could have exploded.\\n\\n\r\nI should have probably finished the show before reviewing it, but nah.\\n\r\nI got 2 minutes into episode 20 (because in episode 19, there was a hint that Irie might become a better person at some point) so I continued. But then he reverted to our neighborhood ignoring, idiotic guy, and with that, I exploded. I give up. And no matter how you try to convince me otherwise I will keep the opinion I have of this sexist, stupid, pointless, PAINFUL show.",

            "content": "The series has just ended, and I can finally deem myself worthy enough to write a review. But beware spoilers after the first paragraph! \r\nWhat is Itazura na Kiss exactly? Probably the most amazing, wonderful, and romantic anime you will ever find. The story follows Kotoko, a cute and spunky girl who, though she is not book smart, is makes up for it in personality traits that a normal human could not possess. Kotoko is the girl everyone who has failed a class wants to be, the girl that gets kicked around by those smarter and more attractive than herself, but who is able toignore all of these things because of her strong will and determination. \\n\r\nAt the beginning, we are introduced to not only Kotoko but Irie-kun, the most intelligent and attractive student in, well, Japan. He is so scarily intelligent and good looking that it is only natural he shuns every girl who professes her love to him. And so naturally, when Kotoko, who has had her eye on Irie for years, tries to give him a love letter, he refuses it. Normally, for any girl, this is where the story would end, but for Kotoko it is only the beginning. After a series of unfortunate events, Kotoko and her father end up in Irie's home. And so begins the story of Itazura na Kiss. Kotoko is put through many trials as she tries to show Irie that she loves him, and living with him and having his AMAZINGLY AWESOMELY HILARIOUS MOTHER on her side is a huge help!\\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot to the story that if I said a lot more it would just spoil it, so I'm going to say this at least: Watch Itazura na Kiss. It's hilarious but the love story is one of the most amazing and romantic ones you will ever find. Kotoko will remain one of my favorite characters of all time because through her hard work and determination to win the one that she loves, she proves to everyone that you CAN have your happy ending and have everything you could possibly ever want. \\n\\n\r\nART: The art may seem a little off, but they tried to stick to the original character designs by Kaoru Tada, who died in the process of writing the manga for it. Episode 25 is scarily a lot like the manga in terms of art. Irie and Kotoko change after they get married...it's hard to put your finger on what is so different. But as the story processes the art seems to get a little sloppier. Other than that, I'm really glad they stuck to Kaoru Tada's original design for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Sound is good. Kotoko has a really cute voice, Irie rarely talks so his is not as important. It's Irie's mother that is so amazing, her laugh is the PERFECT &quot;oh ho ho!&quot; laugh.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: Like I said, you'll never find another like Kotoko. And it's really sweet to see how Irie changes the more that Kotoko affects him and makes him think and wonder about his life, and about how he feels about her. Hands down though, Irie's mother is the best character though. She plays so many tricks to get Kotoko--the daughter she never had--to have her way, and tries to steer Irie along into her trap. She is forceful and hilarious and brings most of the comedy into the VERY sarcastic series.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: I was of course very happy watching the series. Filler episodes tend to get annoying, but you're just dying to see what Irie will do next in the earlier episodes. There is a lot that isn't covered in the series that you should know about Irie. I highly suggest reading the manga or at least checking out the Wikipedia article on Itazura na Kiss. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Best anime ever. It was totally amazing, and it doesn't matter WHAT you're genre is: Mecha, Shoujo, Shonen, etc. Just watch Itazura na Kiss. It's the anime that falls into it's own genre because it is so amazing. ARIGATO KAORU TADA FOR YOUR CREATION!!!",

            "content": "Somewhat spoiler-free review:\r\nSeeing the high score on MAL made me think this was going to be a good Shojou Romance. I was in for a rude awakening with this one. As I have lived in Japan for over a decade, I know full well the patriarchal dominance and chauvinism of a good portion of male citizens. Naoki is nothing more than a pretty face hiding a terrible persona. Kotoko is mentally subdued by him throughout the entirety of the show. He treats her terribly 99% of the time. He mentally and emotionally abuses her. When he realizes he is losing his hold on her ata myriad of times, he uses flashy words or phrases to manipulate her into running back into his arms. He treats her like a tool to keep himself at ease with little care for her feelings until the last few episodes where he just slightly cares due to her situation (trying not to spoil too much). Many viewers were calling him a tsundere. He isn't. He is just a toxic male persona. The entire time watching all I could think of was actions speak louder than words. As I said, he used a lot of flashy wordage, but he rarely used action as proof. Naoki's family and Kotoko's father were all oblivious to the terrible way he treated her (save for his mother who sometimes got upset, but not enough for Naoki to care). They also added to the issues by not taking her feelings into account for a majority of the show. *Slight Spoiler* The biggest failure was Kotoko's father sitting down with Naoki at one point for a friendly chat about why she ran away near the end half of the series due to Naoki's treatment of her. He put his own daughter down while talking about how she is similar to his wife and even sympathized with Naoki having to deal with it. A real father would chew him out for treating his daughter like a cold-hearted jerk, not stroll down memory lane. *End Spoiler* This is definitely not an anime for kids who can't use logic when viewing as it sets a bad example of how one should act in relationships. As for the other characters they all have many terrible personas. From people only loving someone based off looks, trying to steal other people's lovers, trying to cheat (honeymoon episode), being creepy, or going as far as forcing themselves onto other characters, this is not a show worth enjoying. There are plenty of beautiful Shoujou and non-Shoujou Romance anime out there worth your time. Unless you really want to watch this to see how disgusting people can be, I advise finding something better.\\n\\n\r\nI found the whole story to be very cringy at best due to everything I stated above. Hence the pathetic score. The art was slightly old-school which I don't mind, but the elongated chins were odd looking. Hence the fair score. The sound was fine. Characters... It's what really drove home the terrible nature of this anime. While there was progression for everyone, most of their personas stayed the same disgusting shade. Hence dreadful. I didn't get much enjoyment out of it, but I never drop anime and watched it until the end. Overall, it was not worth it. Please don't be fooled by the score.",

            "content": "\"Love isn\u2019t blind. It\u2019s retarded.\" \u2013 Charlie, Two and a Half Men\r\nWhat happens when the unstoppable force meets the immovable object? Love blossoms, of course! Itazura na Kiss is the anime adaptation of the smash hit manga of the same name that published in the late 1990s. However, due to the sudden death of the mangaka, Karou Tada, the manga never reached its intended climax. After the release of three successful live action series (and another later in 2010), TMS Entertainment decided to conceptualize the ending and produce a 25 episode anime series. \r\nItazura na Kiss follows Kotoko, a naive and clumsy girl who fallshead over heels for the brilliant and handsome Naoki. Unfortunately for her, he is the king of all tsunderes and refuses to even cast a second glance at her. After Kotoko\u2019s house is destroyed due to some silly reason, she is forced to move into (*gasps*) Naoki\u2019s house. The rest of the story is dedicated to Kotoko\u2019s pursuit of her Prince Charming and the struggles on how a relationship might not always but be milk and roses, especially if the girl\u2019s a klutz and the guy\u2019s heart is made of stone.\\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat, it has to be mentioned that Itazura stands out mainly because of telling the tale even after the couple unite. Seeing that this is a shoujo, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m bursting anyone\u2019s bubble here. In fact, that is the selling point of this anime \u2013 it has a story even after the much awaited confession and acceptance. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of this anime is like a very bumpy road trip \u2013 it\u2019s rough, rutted and will frustrate, but when it\u2019s good, it\u2019s a real joy. At the core, this show is a rom-com and delivers well to a decent extent on both ends. Shoujo enthusiasts will be delighted to see their most beloved clich\u00e9s wrapped into a well executed package. The plot twists are steep enough to keep most guessing and although it can test one\u2019s patience with cheesy dialogues, there isn\u2019t a single moment in this anime that will make you bored. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Itazura\u2019s story is, as mentioned a few lines ago, extremely patchy. This can be attributed to the overdose of comic relief, which serves as a total mood crusher. Just when the show has a good rapport going with the viewer, plunging its tendrils into our hearts, it immediately barricades itself with its corny sense of humor and excessive chibi. It fails to take itself seriously. Moments that have so much potential to be moving and memorable are completely underutilized because of the anime\u2019s inability to be consistent with the mood. Now, the jokes are good and will give you a good chuckle or two, but they soon grow to be as annoying as a weight machine next to an all-you-can-eat buffet. It\u2019s a good thing that the show steps up its game episode 18 upwards, from where things are far more consistent and gripping. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire concept of love and romance in the anime (like many generic shoujo) is twisted. According to Itazura rules, people are like Pokemon \u2013 you gotta capture them. The one who has just a one-sided crush becomes madly in love with the other person and become delirious to all reason and logic.  They will instantly abandon all their dignity and self-esteem. \u201cLove\u201d here is more or less synonymous with \u201cstalking\u201d. Love someone? Confess to them, follow them and pester them until they finally give in. But this approach is what kept the chemistry between the leads, so it is forgivable.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very mediocre. Despite being a 2008 anime, the backgrounds are average and the detailing is so-so. My major gripe here is the terrible consistency in Kotoko\u2019s face. For comedic effects, they stretch her face until she looks like a pancake and the next second she looks like a mature teenager with beautiful flowing hair. Lots of facepalm-worthy moments. There were some nice touches, like the changing of hairstyles and a decent variation of clothes, which is something that most anime tend to neglect. Overall, it\u2019s a decent job by the animation department, nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very standard with only a couple of pieces standing out. It\u2019s fitting and is never a hindrance or a pleasure. The OP was nothing special and the first ED was a threat to my eardrum\u2019s safety. The second one, on the other hand, was a marvelous track and had great vocals.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the biggest offenders here. No, not all of them, just the one \u2013 Kotoko. While there is nothing wrong with having a clumsy girl, her simplicity often amounts to her acting like a three year old. Whether this maybe for forcing a smile or a \u201ckawai\u201d outcry, her flawed character is irritating. She lacks any self-esteem whatsoever and her childish antics can only be tolerated so much before you throw your hands up in exasperation. Her masochism is pretty high up the chart even for those usual suffer-in-silence shoujo female leads.\\n\\n\r\nNaota on the other hand is a fantastic character. The aim of any character is to provoke a reaction from the viewer, be it is positive or negative. Naoki does the latter admirably, generating a lot of hate for his tsunderity and strong willed single-mindedness. He manages to retain your attention for every second of his air time. The rest of the cast all play their role and there are a lot of recurring ones excluding the family. Plenty of new characters are thrown into the mix along the way and they are always welcome additions.\\n\\n\r\nLike the story, the enjoyment will be in bits and pieces as well. One must have a, how shall I say it, wide sense of humor in order to relish the anime\u2019s weak, yet persistent, sense of humor.  The initial episodes will have you tearing up with laughter, but as the show progresses, the charm wears off. It fails to move away from the same and washed out slapstick jokes and the end result is a viewer grudgingly getting past these \u201cfiller\u201d scenes waiting for the real deal. And the real deal, the romantic scenes, is quite a spectacle. Every time a truly serious situation arises, the chemistry between the arrogant Adonis and the diligent dame does not disappoint. Those looking for the lovey-dovey atmosphere with a touch of class will find exactly what they are looking for in this anime. There are some exceptionally memorable scenes which will make your heart swoon for the couple. This is especially so in the latter half of the series, when the anime (along with the characters) matures.\\n\\n\r\n[ THE WRAP-UP ]\\n\r\nItazura na Kiss is a fantastic anime for those looking for a light hearted rom-com that will entertain more than anything else. TMS Entertainment has done a great job in condensing the pioneering decade-long manga into a well executed 25 episode series. The place where this anime severely lacks is in consistency, largely due to the fact that the humor was shallow and the same jokes were used one too many times. The heartwarming romance is present, but is heavily underplayed and could definitely have been so much more emotional. The animation and sound departments are average and are nothing special. The lead couple is a total yin and yang and while it does make for an enjoyable chemistry, Kotoko is a horrendously flawed character and can be beyond irritating at times. Itazura na Kiss is recommended if you\u2019re looking for something that will cheer you up, while satisfying the shoujo void in your heart and providing a great \u201cafter story\u201d, but just don\u2019t go in expecting anything too deep.",

There is definitely spoilers in this review. \r\nNOTE: HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO REWATCH THIS ANIME IF YOU HAPPENED TO SEE MY COMMENT AND YOU ALREADY LEFT A COMMENT WITH HIGH MIGHTY RATING AGES AGO.\r\nWell, well, well, well I rated this anime 7 back then when I was a child. I thought I should re-watch this after reading the synopsis and was clearly dumbfounded that I actually liked this anime. Was I masochist  or am I just plainly ignorant back then?\r\nStory and Character\r\nAlright, the MC girl is a stupid, clumsy, masochist, dimwit, silly, idiot, klutzy-- wait, did I just use interchangeable wordsexcessively? You damn right I did. I cannot fathom her attitude at all. She's like the god of stupidity and masochism because all she did is offer her life to a sadist wannabe man who clearly thinks she is a piece of shit (probably worse than that). The guy? I don't think he's a man at all, I don't even categorize him as human. If you want to know whether both characters improved throughout the anime, I can guarantee you that they did not. The only good part about this anime is how the story revolves around them; how she chases him, them finally being a couple, graduating school, working, getting married and actually having a child. They are infuriating to watch but I have to see what I liked about this anime back then. In the end, I just cannot deal the fact that this anime is just plain garbage. I think I lose half of my life by just realizing how the characters force a relationship despite the lack of chemistry, respect or even humanity. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIf there is a fantastic anime out there, this one tops the craptastic anime of all time for me. It leaves a bitter taste in my mouth and as much as I want to rate it 1, I have to give it 2 for the sake of my childhood life. Man, if you still want to give this a good rating, I salute you for appreciating the horrendous opposite attract shenanigans. Oh wait, I don't even think he is attracted to the girl at all. \\n\\n\r\nAgain: RECOMMEND TO RE WATCH AND RE EVALUATE YOUR SCORE FOR THIS ANIME IF YOU HAPPENED TO RATE THIS FROM 7-10 SCORE. I am trying to save your soul.",

            "content": "Itazura na Kiss, or \"Mischievous Kiss\", does start out as a typical romantic comedy of Kotoko Aihara having a crush on Naoki Irie for a long time. When Kotoko gathers enough courage to give Naoki a love letter on her 18th birthday, he flat out refuses to accept it. That is when the stereotype of romantic comedy takes a nice detour. \r\nAside from the synopsis that I gave above, Kotoko is pretty much an airhead when it comes to most things where as Naoki seems to be able to do almost anything set in fromt of him. Actually, Naoki said \"I can probably do about90% of all things in the world. But the other 10% I can't do, she does better than anyone.&quot; But that's getting to far ahead of ourselves. Their personalities couldn't be further apart either. Kotoko is a lively, daydreaming, hopeless romantic and Naoki is a cold, aloof, almost arrogant guy. And Kotoko seems to be in love with him.\\n\\n\r\nAfter some of bad mishaps with Kotoko and her father, fate it seems, threw the main characters together since Kotoko and Naoki's fathers knew each other since they were kids. Pretty farfetched, but I'll run with it. Then come on the one-sided love from Kotoko that slowly (I mean slowly) brings Naoki into the realm of loving her bit-by-bit. That and she blackmailed him in the beginning with some embarassing pictures of Naoki as a baby, from his own mother. Sheesh.\\n\\n\r\n(Beware of reading on at this point, SPOILER ALERT!!!)\\n\\n\r\nThe exceptional part of this anime is that the story goes far beyond the high school life. It even goes well beyond college. That is what gave it a worthy anime. It doesn't just stick into the high school life like a lot of anime goes through. College, medical school, even their marriage is shown. A nice way of bringing what we most want to see in the love story animes of our time. Of course ther are a few flaws.\\n\\n\r\nTime jumps for example do happen in the anime. But it is not without consideration that the manga does go through some filler where the anime does not. Interesting that the Director wanted to do that. Usually it is the other way around. But there is some more flaws to be had. The fact that Kotoko and Naoki's wedding happened 2 weeks after their engagement threw me off, but it was explained that the mom had in fact, planned everything to happen. Funny how the mom is a brilliant schemer. And when you see Kotomi finally born, you don't really see a lot of character development on the last episode, or even if Kotoko and Naoki wanted another child. Speaking of which, when they do have their child, they still live with Naoki's parents. They are around 30 at the time. Don't you think that they should move out by now?\\n\\n\r\nBut flaws aside, it is still worth watching. Character development, sound and story does have great qualities and is well thought out. The artwork on some scenes kind of seemed childish, but that is what was intended so I let it slide. Altogether, a good story to behold. Not a &quot;Must See&quot;, but definately worth checking out a couple of episodes to see your interest.",

Staff animation but hey, its still pretty darn good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nPretty much any OST will grow on me over time, it wasn't bad for an anime such as this.\\n\r\nThe endings were relevant to the moods expressed in the story and they were both catchy.\\n\r\nThe fact that they made the openings memorable leaves a lasting impression on you.\\n\r\nHowever things such as rap songs midway through happy/sad scenes tends to kill things so I'll be giving an 8.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThe characters are rather hate-able at times due to their inexperience with emotions, or inability to express themselves, but this is how the story is driven.\\n\r\nIt isn't a negative thing but it will annoy you constantly throughout the animes.\\n\r\nEspecially when they cry over things you know they got themselves into.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nIt had its annoying moments, but overall this anime was addictive, and thats what helps me judge animes, whether it makes me want to keep watching - and it indeed did do that to me.\\n\r\nI would've leaned towards 9 but I disliked the early half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nWell deserving of a score over 8 but far from a 10.\\n\\n\r\nI suggest you watch this, it is a nice heart warming anime which shares its sad moments.\\n\r\nI well recommend it.\\n\r\nI guarantee you'll be able to relate to at least one of the characters and that's one of the most important things you can ever look for in an anime.",

            "content": "This anime caught my atention a while ago. It's a love-drama-slice of life and \"Shoujo\" if you call it the japanesse way. I wasn't expecting anything good from this one but I was wrong, instead this anime turned to out to be one of my favourites of this genre: it has a pretty decent story complemented with rich characters and a very funny overall development.\r\nThe story just begins like it usually does when you mix love and romance with the  Shoujo genre: \"girl likes a boy and tries to tell him about it\". The difference is that (for very incredible circustances xD!) this girlbecomes a guest in this boy's house and also that this boy is a perfect genious and this girl is really on the bottom lot of the senior high school classes (Class A > Class E). Almost half the story is about Kotoko trying to get Irie-kun's attention. She does this by attempting a lot of things that always, for some reason, end in the wrong way and become something seriously funny that makes it look like the gap between them get's bigger and bigger. But as the story goes on Irie Naoki realizes his true feelings and let that \"genious-perfect-cold\" shell go as he get's closer to Kotoko. The story is divided in 3 phases:\\n\r\n1) When the characters are in high school senior year - adolescent stage (the shortest lapse of time).\\n\r\n2) When they are in University or College - pre-adult stage (the longest one).\\n\r\n3) When they have full time jobs - adult stage (intermediate).\\n\r\nThe story jumps some years after between this 3 phases but that happens when there is nothing more to expect from the story at that time, so is a good thing that the story's timeline is manipulated accurately.\\n\\n\r\nVery good drawing is what makes this anime good to watch and really feel a connection with the surroundings in it. The characters are very well designed and let's you have a wide range of experiences: some are ugly to watch (on purpose of course) and some others are just gorgeous. So the art goes from ugly to pretty making a perfect balance between these two themes and making this anime a complete one. The sound  is something I'm not that enthusiastic about in this anime. Didn't really like the opening or ending and the BMG's in the anime events well I really didn't identiffy them so is like they can delete those sounds inside the anime and I wouldn't notice xD! On the bright side I loved the japanesse voice acting because the voices do feel like each character personal presentation card.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are just very diverse. They behave and act differently one from another, each one is different in it's own way and make the anime really fresh and friendly to watch. Definitely love Kotoko, she's just so funny and entertaining that you always wish that she comes with another love-atack plan XD! But overall a very heterogenous cast of characters that make the anime funny and interesting in as many ways as types of characters are in it.\\n\\n\r\nA increible cast, a funny story and a good design make this anime worthwhile. I promise that you are going to laugh a lot with this one and really enjoy it. The 25 episodes seen to be very long and boring to watch but as you go through them you will find yourself immersed in the story and, actually, when the anime finishes you will be impressed on how quickly things passed by. I enjoyed this from begining to end, there is no sad ending and I wouldn't call it a happy ending either, it's just like life itself. This anime will tell you what happens when you try your hardest even if you are a failure at everything you do.",

            "content": "Itazura Kiss: An absolute abomination of an anime that also manages to throw in some horrible messages on top of it.\r\nThis review of a show over a decade old will almost certainly get buried, but there are still some important things that need to be said and heard about this series. Despite the fact I am outside its target audience, I consider myself a bit of a advocate for shoujo anime, but for anyone that is not as familiar with the \u201cgenre\u201d, either: (a) Do not watch Ita Kiss, or (b) If you have, don\u2019t write off the whole genre because of it. There areplenty of good shoujo anime out there, but this is not one of them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nI could name the number of people I liked in this show on one hand, and that would even be the case if I got attacked by an alligator and lost three of my fingers. But the two leads will be getting the lion\u2019s share of the attention here. \\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist is Kotoko. Her defining characteristic is her lack of intelligence. Yup. To spell it out for you, she is quite simply the most bland, generic, uninspired main character I have ever come across. Her only real role is very clearly to be the \u201cself-insert character\u201d. Then we have Irie, the main love interest. He is smart, rich, and good-looking, but also a cold, pompous a-hole. \\n\\n\r\nOh, and Kotoko has been in love with him for two years despite having never spoken to him. What. The. Hell. The only rational explanation is she is just shallow almost beyond belief. Crush is one thing, but love? But you might be thinking, \u201chey, once she gets to know what an abhorrent human being he is, she\u2019ll come to her senses, right?\u201d. Oh boy would you be wrong. No matter how much he bullied her, abused her emotionally, mentally, and verbally, her feelings seemed to grow and grow. Watching her grovel for his attention and swoon anytime he as much as looked in her direction was one of the most pathetic displays I\u2019ve seen in the medium. Like have some self-respect, jesus. So why would one of the smartest and best-looking guys in the country fall for a girl like her? Well, in reality, he wouldn\u2019t, but she is the main character after all, so he basically had no choice. The plot demanded him to fall in love with her. Seriously, though, never has an anime couple made less sense and been this unlikable.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the other characters, the only one really worth talking about was Irie\u2019s mother. The bar set by the two leads was exceptionally low, but she might\u2019ve been even worse. Ok, so she instantly wants the two to get together. Why? I have no idea, because Kotoko is a bore and a half. But alright, that in and of itself is not a deal-breaker, but the meddling. My god. Obnoxious wouldn\u2019t even begin to cover it. It actually got to the point of sabotaging other potential relationships and trash-talking her own son to turn other girls against him. Are you kidding me? Irie\u2019s mom is just the worst of the worst.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nThe story is dumb and predictable as well. Read the synopsis and there won\u2019t be a ton of surprises, I assure you. Kotoko is rejected by Irie and has to move in with his family after an earthquake destroys her family's house. Great. Outside of the fact the romance lasted past high school, there was never a single interesting or original aspect to the story.\\n\\n\r\nBut now to touch on the \u201chorrible messages\u201d I alluded to in the opening line. Irie, as we\u2019ve covered already, is intelligent, attractive, rich, well-bred, etc. But here\u2019s the thing, just because you\u2019re Mr. Hot Stuff or whatever, does not mean you get a free pass to treat everyone around you like human trash. Seriously, some of the things he said or did, specifically to Kotoko, were repulsive. And not only did he get away with it, she was still madly in love with the guy. Whether you\u2019re a guy or a girl, you should not be allowed to treat people they way he did just because you have enough desirable traits. And this anime, and especially Kotoko, proved the exact opposite of that. I sincerely hope there aren\u2019t any young, impressionable guys or girls out there watching this and thinking this is normal or ok, let alone the ideal love story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3\\n\r\nThe art, likewise is atrocious. Kotoko looked like a giant, confused toddler in most scenes. This was the case for a lot of the female characters in show. Irie\u2019s model shifted so much you didn\u2019t know if he was going to have the perfect shoujo bishie or deformed face look. It\u2019s amazing this show is from 2008; it looks worse than most shows 5 years older.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re thinking the saving grace is the sound, you would be wrong. None of the OP/EDs were anything but skippable and there wasn\u2019t a single VA performance that stood out. The two leads in particular gave flat, often-times grating, performances.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\r\nIf it wasn\u2019t for my self-imposed \u201cno-drop policy\u201d, I would\u2019ve stopped 1 episode in. Every second was excruciating. I genuinely mean that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nWhat do you get when you pair the most boring, self-insert MC ever with the world\u2019s biggest sociopathic jerk, and do literally nothing else well or revolutionary? You get this unspeakable mess that should\u2019ve never been put out into the world.",

            "content": "This show is good but nothing great. The best thing it has going is the format of the show, it follows different stages of life of the characters. And it has a solid ending. These things are what save the show.\r\nNow the bad stuff, this show has one of the worse ships ever. We have our MC Aihara madly in love with the smartest and coolest dude in school and would give her life for him... even tho she is abused in public, insulted, teased and made fun of her feeling by her \"loved one\" for at least half of the show. Also you haveto know that she loves him to such extent because \"he is cool and smart\".\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe dude is one of the biggest assholes ever but \"he is really gentle\" very deep down... or at least she thinks. Usually irl these things never end well, but well, it's anime and hardwork with good will can win everything.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow the secondary cast, pretty bad for the most part and most of the dudes have the \"good guy syndrome\" so they are creepy AF. The girls have almost no relevance.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you want to see a girl with no self respect madly in love with a cunt because he is cool being  insulted half of the time, changing the heart of the asshole (something that always work irl)  and becoming one of the most forced relationships ever then you should enjoy this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, despite of all this the \"uniqueness\" makes it enjoyable. The middle part of the show was the most enjoyable to me. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was OK for the backgrounds... but the character design was inconsistent in a lot of moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe VAs and the music was nice.\\n\\n\r\nI won't rewatch this ever again.

            "content": "I've never written a review before but I just had to write a review for this one.  If I can save one person from the misery of sitting through this tripe then I'll have done my duty as a human being.  I've forgotten the names of the male and female lead but it doesn't matter.  As this review focusses solely on them, the words \"he\" and \"she\" should cover it.  \r\nSo here it is: The idea of a romantic comedy is to make the viewer/reader root for the couple in the spotlight; to cheer them on in their quest to findtrue love while at the same time, giving us a good laugh in the process.  Itazura na Kiss does none of this.  Unless you find a girl's miserable existence, trapped in a one-sided relationship with a bully, great comedy material, you will not enjoy this.\\n\\n\r\nThe female lead in this show is a salavating halfwit and the male lead is an egotistical misogynist.  For some reason, despite the fact this simply horrible man treats her like something most of us would avoid stepping in, however, she adores him.  The show covers nine years by my recollection and this never changes once.  She remains smitten by someone who clearly has no respect for her whatsoever and he never stops being a hateful scumbug.\\n\\n\r\nAs the show goes on, you find yourself rooting for the male lead to die.  Not just to lose her love, but to be killed in a horrible accident.  Alas this doesn't happen.  If it had, this alleged comedy might finally have given us something to laugh about, but alas he does not.\\n\\n\r\nWithout saying too much and spoiling anything, the show follows their romance from high school up until they're in the late twenties.  They get married and eventually have a child together, then finally our hell is at an end because they stopped making this rubbish.  During those years covered, the male lead sneers at and looks down on his dimwitted other half constantly.  He gets nastier and nastier by the minute then every now and again he'll say something like, \"You may look like a mutant from the planet uggo but you're not the least prettiest moron I've ever shagged.\"  At which point, she will go starry eyed and drool, taking his words as a compliment.  The real insult there being that as the viewer, we're supposed to find his back-handed compliments endearing too.  We don't.  They just make us want to drown him.  \\n\\n\r\nFinally, just to hammer home the point of what a nasty show this is.  At one point the female lead actually stands up for herself and screams at him, \"You don't love me.\"  Finally, I thought.  It's about time she stood up for herself.  Sadly no.  He hits her!  Yes, he resorts to domestic violence.  To make matters worse, she then finds herself feeling guilty and blames herself for putting too much pressure on him.  Oh yes, he whacks her and she apologises.  I kid you not!  If this was a subjective look into the mind of a battered woman, I'd say give them an Oscar.  However, it is not.  This is apparently a comedy.  Maybe if you hate women you might find this quite the turn on or indeed worthy of a chuckle, for decent human beings, however, this anime is quite frankly wrong.",

She deserves all of this.\r\nIrie is basically a bully. The only reason he is with Aihara is because she is too stupid and he can control her easily ( for example when she wants to forget about him he just kisses her only soshe cannot forget about him). He treats her like shit.  I just hope that no one will ever fall for this kind of jerk.\\n\r\nOh and he isn;t even smart , he just has photographic memory so he remembers everything after reading it once. He doesn't have to put in any effort but looks down on people who weren't blessed with a photographic memory like his.\\n\\n\r\nThe only good thing I have to say about this anime is how the story progresses quickly, and shows the characters when they are older.",

I did't really enjoy it that much after they got married, although the rest of the story was very good.\r\n[ART]\r\n-----------\r\nThe quality in this anime was average. It was very unclear sometimes when the scene got dark, although the scenery and landscape were very well detailed. \r\n[SOUND]\r\n-----------\r\nI don't think there is a dubbed version for this anime, but I'm not sure. I watched the subbed version, and the voice actor for Irie really expressed his personality, including Aihara, although the music didn't really fit in at times.I never really enjoyed the opening or the ending theme of this anime. \\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nIrie was really cold to Aihara, which really annoyed me at times, but of course, it was part of the story, so I can't really complain. Although, at first, when I was looking at the details of the story, I really thought Irie was around his 30s. He looked like a full grown adult that is working as a professor. Also really felt weird because Irie just looks so much older than Aihara in the beginning, and sometimes made me feel uncomfortable watching it.\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nAgain, I really enjoyed the anime until after Aihara and Irie got married. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nOverall, I (personal opinion) wouldn't watch this anime again. It was average, but it was still very interesting to watch 2 oddly paired people get to know each other better and actually fall in love with each other.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: \\n\r\n7/10 if I did my math right.\\n",

It then expands the story, adding nuances and drama that bring life and interest to an otherwise cliched genre story.

Plain-Jane girl seems to accept being ignored and general emotional abuse as OK because guy is hot, rich and smart. Show portrays this as acceptable and basically ends with the moral of \"love can solve abusive relationships, it's probably your fault anyways\". \\n\\n\r\nTo insult the man-isist within you: Dumb broad deserves what she gets; she has no problems deceiving and manipulating comic-relief-romantic-interest-male in a pretty disgusting way for her own benefit.",

What do they have in common you ask? They both make me cringe. \r\nThe only reason I think I gave this anime a 2 is because there are moments that really engage one's sense of empathy - you laugh sometimes at the things that Kotoko does (if you're not cringing) and you cry. I really felt Kotoko's pain sometimes - and boy does she go through a lot of it. Perhaps one of the mostdisturbing aspects of Itazura Na Kiss is that it's quite dismissive of Kotoko's pain and doesn't really focus on character development at all. But then it does get difficult to feel sorry for someone like her after a while. How cool would it have been if the first couple of episodes were just to demonstrate how naive she was to begin with, and then she got it together became an awesome ball-buster of a tsundere?! It probably would have been one of my favorite animes ever. But unfortunately, as the episodes progressed it became evident that.. well, this is sadistic bull. It's really almost unbearable. The way in which Kotoko is treated by Naoki and the her utter masochistic behavior was genuinely horrifying for me to witness. \\n\\n\r\nI hope that no girl or woman ever aspires to be like her; it makes me so angry that people don't recognize how twisted this anime is sometimes.",

            "content": "Okay, first of all, apologies in advance for the perhaps colorful language that I'll be using in this review.\r\nThis anime, while generally average, has the highlight of having the single douchiest character that I have ever seen to date. Seriously, Irie is so impressively terrible to everything and everyone (especially the female lead) that her own musings on her potential masochistic tendencies are less musings and more an exercise in stating the obvious.\r\nThis anime quite obviously tries to have an archetypical strong, silent, impassive and cold guy, but the creators obviously could not tell when enough was enough when adding from the 'cold' jar. Seriously,this guy is so extremely over the edge in the 'a-hole' department that he's in a class of his own. I seriously have no one else to compare him to.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime deserves credit for that, if nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the female lead, there isn't too much to say about her. Kotoko actually does manage to land perfectly in the center of her archetype, the 'always nice to everything and everyone beyond any sense of logic, duty or reason' hyperactive, cheerful kind of character. It's very easy to like and root for characters like her, but in the end she is rather forgettable. Also, my biggest gripe with her, is that I simply can not respect her. I pity her. Say what you will about having the single-minded determination to never give up on the man, no matter how rude and/or abusive he is towards her, but there is 'determined' and then there is 'self-punishingly moronic'. Watching Kotoko was painful, because in reality girls like her need professional help and a lot of support in order to get over the compulsion that keeps sending them back to their abuser and live a full and healthy life.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the best part of this anime was its supporting cast, though that speaks more about the low quality of everything else.\\n\\n\r\nI gave Itazura na kiss a 4/10. The animation was below average, the main characters were hilariously bad caricatures of people, and the plot itself was slow, predictable, and ultimately unfulfilling.\\n\\n\r\nProps for sending young adolescent girls all the wrong messages, I guess.",

            "content": "Itazura na Kiss is an awful rom-com. It\u2019s heavily flawed on every level and the ambitious premise doesn't make up for the horrible characters and misguided recurring themes in this anime.\r\nStory (1/10): \r\nItazura na Kiss is a story about how a unintelligent girl with no redeeming qualities other than being kind, relentlessly pursues her crush, who is a scumbag, and then proceeds with a long term emotionally (and physically to some extent) abusive relationship that is for some reason framed in a positive light. Sounds awful, right? I see a lot of praise for this anime comes from the premise, which is ambitious in thesense that it covers a long period of time and touches on romance past the usual \"mutually confess and get together\" phase where most romance anime end. What left a bad taste in my mouth is how Itazura na Kiss's narrative tries to portray a destructive and outright disgusting romance as something acceptable and even worth striving for. The very fact that this anime even exists is a moral stain on the industry.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond this hollow and sickening take on what initially seemed an interesting premise, this anime still utilizes every shoujo troupe in the book but fails to execute them in a way that meaningfully adds to the characters, story, or underlying themes (which are.. problematic, to say the least). One example would be when they transitioned from high school to college, yet every character ended up at the same university in equivalent classes and situations. Even the one character who didn't make it into college conveniently found employment as a cafeteria worker at the school. Every \"major\" development was underwhelming and screamed lazy writing.\\n\\n\r\nArt (3/10): \\n\\n\r\nI wasn't a fan of the art style heading into this anime, I find it wildly inconsistent and lacking any artistic direction, which is why I put off watching this for so long despite the intriguing premise. The male lead is the ugliest character in the show which I'm pretty sure is opposite of the intended effect. His mouth was way too close to his nose which just highlighted his stupid gigantic chin, but I guess that\u2019s personal preference. The MC was pretty cute and the backgrounds were run of the mill. \\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nI actually enjoyed the voice acting in this anime. The roles should have been easy considering how one-note all the characters are, so I can't heap too much praise here, but overall I thought they did well. The music was decent. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (0/10): \\n\\n\r\nAwful, awful, awful, abysmal, trash, embarrassing, awful, and plain bad. The main two are the worst of the bunch, which should never be the case, and all the side characters were static and underwent absurdly predictable, clich\u00e9 developmental character arcs, that were for the most part, just convenient cop-outs to force feed happy endings for everyone. \\n\\n\r\nOur MC is dumb, talentless, and unwaveringly in love with a guy who continually treats her like garbage and belittles her. At one point in the show she decides to become a nurse for the sole purpose of being able to better support her doctor husband. Eventually a side character points this out critically, but the show failed to delve into the critique as the MC never directly responds to the issue nor has any internal monologue regarding it.  I found their dynamic, and the show as a whole, to be incredibly misogynistic, which is very discomforting considering this a shoujo. \\n\\n\r\nThe show never decides to really point out the self-destructive nature of her character and instead casts it aside in favor of framing her as a \u201cspunky\u201d good hearted girl and somehow expects the viewer to find solace in her simplicity. The worst example of this was when she discovers a side character in distress and then proceeds to completely panic and cry on the phone as the male lead tells her what to do, step by step, including how to call an ambulance. Bear in mind this happens in the latter half of the series which exemplifies her complete lack of development as a competent human being. \\n\\n\r\nThe male lead is initially a \u201ccool\u201d jerk, which is typical in shoujo, but usually the male lead ends up progressively improving as a person as the MC warms his cold heart, so to speak, or they were always \u201cgood\u201d and just not great at outwardly expressing it. This male lead in Itazura na Kiss is a jerk, and a truly horrible one at that, who doesn\u2019t become a redeeming character until the last 2 or 3 episodes. On numerous occasions he shows some compassion but then consistently reverts back to his usual disgusting self. There\u2019s also usually a reason, such as a tragic experience or difficult childhood, for the male leads initial behavior, but here the male lead has lived a carefree life in a traditional atomic household with his loving and wealthy parents. He has an amazing support system and the show never alluded to anything negative in his past to attempt to explain his flaws.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, she is incompetent and he is lacking in basic humanity. I\u2019m not exactly sure how these are supposed to be likeable characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (1/10): \\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy watching this anime whatsoever. In fact, I watched the last 5 episodes at double the speed, as in I literally sped up the video 2x, in order to avoid wasting any more of my life on this irreprehensible trash heap of an anime. The misogynistic central relationship was frankly appalling, as was the lack of character development. I will say that the ending (episode 24; 25 is a light hearted epilogue) was heartwarming and enjoyable. At this point they are in their late 20s and the MC finally shows some fortitude that isn\u2019t directly derived from her unsubstantiated romantic feelings, and the male lead finally shows respectable character traits without ever reverting. The problem with Itazura na Kiss is that it takes 23 episodes, or approximately 10 years within the timeline of the show, for these characters to achieve this minimally acceptable level of competence and humanity.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch a terrible rom-com anime with unlikeable characters and misogynistic themes, look no further, Itazura na Kiss is the anime for you.\\n",

I mean no offence, and I seek forgiveness from the entire feminist fanbase who will feel offended but this is the truth... Is enaf to read some shoujo and see that in proportion of 90% they are all the same thing... a girl who usually falls in love with a popular boy, the girl is boring, there is tons of forced drama that makes you wonder: ''Is this mangaka a virgin ? Did she ever was in a relationship or she knows everything from shoujo manga? Are Japanese teenagersso dumb in real life?'' Those who watched Kimi no Todoke (which is a good story) or read Ao Haru Ride knows what I am talking about (dumb melodramatic situations)... Basically you really have the feeling that those mangaka knows everything about relationships from other shoujo manga, this is the only way in which we can explain all those similar stories that lack originality, and are kind of like a new chapter from a really looong story, or another season of Young & Restless... Why do I know all of this? Well, because of some diabolic conspiration I end up reading a lot of shoujo manga (I am kind of embarrassed to admit it, but is the truth). But even if 90% is clich\u00e9, there is this 10% that really worth your time... So is Itazura na Kiss is in this category? NO. Well is a little complicated...\\n\\n\r\n-  Let me explain few things before: this review will be about the anime, sadly as many may know, the mangaka died before finishing the manga (R.I.P), so I won\u2019t bother reading something unfinished... The reason why I started speaking about shoujo manga is because the amount of shoujo manga that receives anime adaptations is really small in comparation with other genres (is actually something extraordinary if you have more than one per Season), and those who receive adaptations are usually from that 10% -\\n\\n\r\nBack to Itazura na Kiss... I can\u2019t really consider this story part of that 10%, because that percent apply to the last decade. Itazura na Kiss manga come up in late 90' a period in which anime industry started its grow, but it was a period in which originality could be still a big thing. Itzura come up in a perioud when shoujo manga didn\u2019t had ULTRA-MEGA-SUPER melodramatic situations that would make you FACEWALL every 10 seconds, and would give you really dark feelings (cough* Ao Haru Ride cough*)... it was a period where many good shoujo started to emerge on the market, but it was a period in which many story\u2019s would lack something important... in shouen manga for example there wasn\u2019t a well-developed combat system (there was everything about martial arts and beams) but it was the late 90' where things started to change with aparition of much complex story\u2019s like Naruto... Itazura na Kiss lacks something important too, and I will explain what a little later. \\n\r\nThis story is an important piece of the foundation on which later clich\u00e9 where built on, that why I don\u2019t consider this story as part of the 10%, being a classic, but that doesn\u2019t mean is not good... is actually damn good. Even though the manga is old, the anime come up in 2008 (good year), so is quite current, it still have its old school aura trought, and this is what makes it stand out. \\n\\n\r\nStory: Before talking about story let me explain a really important thing. I saw that some complained about the romance in this story, that lack in comparation with story\u2019s like Kimi no Todoke, Fruits Basket, etc. They are right, BUT this anime is not a shoujo romance, is a ROMANTIC COMEDY, the main genre of this story is COMEDY. What is the difference between this and romance? Well classical romantic comedies are: Pretty Woman, 10 Things I hate about You, City Lights (those are movies if you don\u2019t know), romance is: Rome and Juliet, Titanic, Gone with the Wind... well is a little dumb to compare anime with American movies but is to make an ideea. For those who are used with the shoujo of this decade, and expect lots of development and melodrama, you won\u2019t find this here... Those kind of peoples gave negative reviews to this anime, and I understand... they are like those guys who always watched movies where Arnold Schwarzenegger will fight against an army with machine guns, alone using a colt 45,  without being shot or finish his ammunition even if his weapon had just 4 bullets, and then he shoots a bullet in a car which explodes like a nuke and destroy a city... and those guys start watching a realist historical movie about WWII and complain that the main characters suck in comparation with Arnold, and the movie is stupid.\\n\r\n THE STORY: starts with Kotoko, in the first episode she moves together with her father in a their new built house... but her father was too greedy to invest in good materials as a result the house falls apart in that night, after a 4 grade earthquake. As they remained homeless, she and her father move to his old friends which happens to be the parents of Irie Naoki, the boy on which  she has a crush and the one that rejected her love letter in just 1 second, because as he said, he doesn\u2019t like dumb girls... Seriously if someone\u2019s expect a serious romance after this synopsis or the first episode they have a problem. The story from then revolves mainly around Kotoko's effort to make Irie love her, gain his attention, and stuffs like that. What is really different from many story\u2019s, is that this anime follows the characters for a period of over 10 years... Here is the little small problem that many complain, and the thing that this story lacks:  the development. Even though in those +10 years their relationship develops A LOOOT (I don\u2019t want to spoil you), in the same time it doesn\u2019t develop too much... The development exists in their relation and situation, but not in their romantic life or in their feelings. Even after 9 years Irie treats Kotoko kind of the same. Kotoko fall in love with him, in her first years of high school because he was smart and handsome, but they didn\u2019t have an interaction until he rejected her, and after she started to live with him and his family. After she meets him her ideal image of him should shatter, as he is a total jerk. But her feelings doesn\u2019t change, and remain as powerful over the years, which is really weird, because Irie is not what a woman would wish as a partner... of course he would be the perfect husband: smart, with a career and looks, but he would be the husband that wouldn\u2019t make her feel loved, as a result she would cheat on him and divorce after few years, taking half of his fortune and probably their childrens and dog. Even so Itazura is a very enjoyable anime. The main genre, comedy, is not there without a purpose, is very funny. There isn\u2019t too much drama, but in a weird way is so well played, and so emotional that I found myself with teary eyes almost every time.\\n\\n\r\n CHARACTERS: The main characters are obviously Kotoko and Irie. Kotoko is a dumb girl, but she is cute and honest. She is part of class F, which is basically, the class for dummies. She is technically good for nothing, she can\u2019t cook, or take care of the house, she isn\u2019t very smart, and she is clumsy, her only qualities being her honesty and stubbornly, which makes her a good character trough. Being clumsy and stubbornly, make her different from usual characters that would cry and fell depressed over every thinly difficulty (and she has a LOOOT, because Irie is... Irie), when a rival appears, she doesn\u2019t back down and despise of her obviously inferiority she fights to win Irie. She really does a lot of things, and changes peoples, she is even able to melt Irie's ice heart (more or less)... Irie say at a point this about her: \"Kotoko is unable to make 90% of the things I can do, but the rest of 10% I can\u2019t do, she excels in making it.'' The problem is that we really don\u2019t know why she loves Irie, he was her first crush, and he remained like this. After their relation develops, the emotional part remains kind of unchanged; she continues to address him as Irie-kun even after 9 years, even though at some point she becomes an Irie too.\\n\r\n Irie is exactly the reverse of Kotoko. He is in class  A, a genius who is number 1 student in Japan. Very handsome (even though Kotoko is very cute too), cold and serious, he starts to change after he meets Kotoko... not because she change something in him (even though she does), but because Kotoko's clumsy action have repercussions against him. He is the main problem of this anime. He doesn\u2019t give too much fuks on Kotoko at the beginning at that doesn\u2019t change too much after he falls in love with her. He continue to be kind of cold, and bully her, or even hurt her (without intention trough), until the last episodes when he gets a little more warm and caring, which is kind of the norm in a normal manga, but at that point in Itazura it has been 9 years since they were together. You understand what kind of a cold bastard is when we see that a year before he had given her, her first birthday present (poor Kotoko trough that the man you love and loves you gives you a present only in movies) I mean seriously, it took him 8 years to give her a present ? Basically what keeps this relationship is Kotoko, and her \"I love Irie and I don\u2019t give up on him'' attitude, which makes her be extremely happy with any small proof of love she recives from him Q.Q (I really want to hug her now Q.Q). Even so, Ire is actually the portrait of usual Japanese male. Take out his looks (they aren\u2019t all handsome) and intelligence (Asians are smart but they aren\u2019t all geniuses), and you have the normal: cold, stiff and too serious Japanese husband who doesn\u2019t say ''I love you'' but he show his love by bringing the money in the house.\\n\r\n The side characters are important too. There is Mama Irie and Papa Irie, and little Irie Yuuki, who respects his onni-chan, and rejects Kotoko for a period, but continue to ''bully'' her, and consider her stupid even after he accepts her. Mama Irie, she loves Kotoko, and her main purpose in the story is to bring Kotoko and her son together, and after they get together she makes sure that their relationship works fine, following them incognito in the honeymoon, and dates. She is really funny, and she makes tons of pictures and films every important moment between Kotoko and Irie. But we don\u2019t really get why she loves Kotoko so much. There is Kotoko\u2019s father too, but isn\u2019t too much to say about him. An important side character is Kinnosuke. He is the dumb guy who is in love with Kotoko. He is basically the male version of Kotoko. You may find him annoying, but you will love his honesty and motivation to do everything for Kotoko. He is the character that in the end receives the biggest character development of all.\\n\\n\r\nART: the art has the old school aura, is nothing special about it, but is not bad either. It suits the story, and the expressions the characters make are really funny.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: again, old school. The OP really remembers you of a 90' anime, and for me it was a surprise that it was done in 2008, because I really trough that is from the beginning of 2000. The ED are good too, the second ED is used few times as a sound track in dramatic moments, which made me laugh at a moment because it has rap, so I couldn\u2019t really take in serious the moment. Nothing special about other tracks trough.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: I saw this for the first time in 2009 or so, and I loved it. I watched it again last week, and I loved it. And I am sure I can watch it again other 10 times, and love it just as much. This really easy to digest story, that will not give you sad butterflies in your belly, instead it will make you feel good. Is sad that the mangaka died before finishing the story (R.I.P), I know that there was more in the manga that wasn\u2019t used in anime, including arcs and characters... I wanted to see more.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: I recommend this anime to everybody who wants to laugh and have a good time.\\n\\n\r\n  PRO: - really funny, and has great and enjoyable characters.\\n\r\n           - ZERO unwanted and dumb melodrama\\n\r\n           - Interesting time skip.\\n\\n\r\nCONS: - I would loved to see more development between characters as a result of some important events.\\n\r\n            - The time skip can be a little annoying at some point when in 1:30 minutes goes 2 years, especially when it comes to Irie Yuuki.\\n\r\n            - Many of the important side characters have been ignored after some point and they didn\u2019t receive they part/development/etc. in the story, like it was covered by the manga.\\n\r\n            - To short, taking in consideration that it follows + 10 years of their life, it really feels rushed and short, leaving you with the feeling of wanting more. An at least 30 episodes was more suited, 50 episodes would had been welcomed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 8\\n\r\nART: 7\\n\r\nSOUND: 7\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 9\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9\\n\\n\r\nP.S.: And for this who complain that it didn\u2019t had development such as Kimi no Todoke, think at this: in Itazura the characters kissed like 3 times, and they did much more\u2026. No kissu in Kimi no Todoke, +30 episodes , and no kiss\u2026\\n",

            "content": "For the MOST part, yes, I did enjoy this anime. The good outweighed the bad which is cause for my scoring.\r\nThe thing about anime's like Itazura na Kiss is that most of the enjoyment is spent on the \"chase\". The girl chasing the guy, the guy starting to realize his true feelings, the struggles of confessions and that is the exciting part. Once they are together it sort of marks the end of a series USUALLY and we are left to imagine thereafter for ourselves. In this case we get to see the aftermath, the adulthood and so on. This isn't always necessarily a badthing and for Itazura it began well, I was happy to see how it panned out, but there was a point in the lower half of the series that started to crumble slowly. The story went everywhere, the couples issues and resolve were sporadic and the time skips were placed oddly, making us feel like ALOT was left out. I couldn't help but lose the connection to the characters and the story. \\n\\n\r\nIrie-kun was a jerk, but a good jerk. He remains the same and even worse as the anime goes on. Only in times of need did he ever seem like he had a soul, which to be fair he did state he doesn't understand affection and how to express it but even for an anime it became far fetched. \\n\\n\r\nKotoko didn't mature in the slightest and that is one thing that annoyed me throughout the entirety of this show. When she stood up for herself and got mad were the only times I could stand her (Which isnt a bad thing - its her character and I get that). \\n\\n\r\nWhat I couldnt take seriously was how they came to be together so quickly and the issues that sprouted once they were. It made no logical sense, the relationship and story started to waver. I enjoyed everything in between but the flow of the story had me a little dissatisfied - comedy was quite funny, romance was there when the climax hit but was lost a second after. I'm not saying this is a bad anime but it pays alot of MINOR flaws - nothing to NOT watch it though. The beginning is very good just be wary of the end sections.",

            "content": "First off, I'm glad I had this to watch during the time I was waiting for Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu: Purezza's new episodes to come out, and I would like to thank AlexisSolitaire for recommending it to me.\r\nThis has become my favorite romance anime that I've seen so far. It's everything a romance junkie like me wants: a beginning, middle, and end; an anime that's 100% romance right from the start and doesn't let go until the closing seconds of the 25th episode.\r\nAt first, I was under the impression that this would be a regular slice-of-life, high school romance anime. I could not have beenmore far from the truth. Not only did it begin in high school (at the age of about 17), it ended with the main heroine in her early 30s or late 20s. You might be skeptical at reading that, but trust me: you'll definitely end up loving it.\\n\r\nThey utilized something at perfect junctures in parts of the story when it could have gone bad. Which usually leads to anime's giving themselves self-inflicted wounds by boring the audience it's trying to entertain half to death. What they utilize so magnificently is the time-lapse. I would have never guessed that there would be a time in my life in which I would enjoy a time-lapse, a \"3 years later.\" Did they ever prove me wrong.\\n\\n\r\nYou know when an anime's good when I was completely satisfied at the half way point! About 14 episodes in! 14! I became skeptical again. Alright, so they've basically done all I've expected them to do, now it's just gonna get bad, how terrible. Again, I was proved wrong.\\n\\n\r\nI like to use analogies to describe things that are tough to put into words; as most people might often do. Well, I attribute this show in this way:\\n\r\nYour parents give you $10 to go to the movies with friends. You're like, \"Alright! Gonna have a good time. Night out with the buddies.\" Turns out, when you get there, you find you have an extra $20 in your pocket. Making the night even better. Then, you happen to be pulled into a side-room by Quentin Tarantino and given a private screening of his latest movie for free. You're thinking, \"Wow. What a night: I got $10, found an extra $20 in your pocket, and I got to see a private screening of the new Tarantino movie! What a night!\" However, your already fantastic night has one more surprise for you. Say you went with a few of your friends, one happened to be the girl you've always had a crush on. But, it turns out that after you walk out of the theater, she turns to you and says \"that she's always liked you.\" How would you feel? How would that night be for you? Great, right? To a lesser extent, that's how I felt when this series was finished. Sad that it was over, happy that I got to experience something so amazing, and even more happy that I got to enjoy all these great surprises around each corner.\\n\\n\r\nI would now go into each individual category and rate the show, but this show needs to stand out from the rest that I've seen in some form or fashion. It deserves no criticism, because, that's ultimately nitpicking for the tiniest deviation from greatness. (Plus, by reviewing most of these things, it would be hard to have people properly understand what I'm talking about or referring to without giving away any spoilers.)\\n\\n\r\nIt really did have a beginning, middle, and end. Not in terms of plot, which, of course it did, but the story of their relationship, the bond between the two is so fun and enchanting to reside over. I actually likened their relationship to that of one of those \"well problems\" that I got back in 5th grade: if you fall to the bottom of a 100 ft well, how long would it take you to climb out if each day you climbed 6 ft but slid down 4 ft?\\n\\n\r\nI would wholeheartedly recommend this to any romance fan out there looking for an engaging story of what it takes to love and what it takes to be open to love. Although some might be critical of the \"superfluousness\" of the later episodes, who cares? Doesn't everyone ultimately wish that they could see their favorite couple from another show develop like this one and end like this one? \\n\r\nIt's a feel good anime that never ceases to stop \"feeling good.\"\\n\\n\r\n10/10, perfect, flawless, etc.\\n\\n\r\nFeedback is appreciated.\\n\r\nIf you want to be told more in-depth of why I liked the show so much, send me a message. However, spoilers will probably be dolled out like soup from a soup kitchen. So ask at your own risk. Or if you disagree with my opinion, and want to talk about the show, I would love to have a profile-to-profile chat.",

It is one of the few romantic anime that is fully packaged with a solid ending. I like the 2 main leads particularly Naoki Irie as he goes through the most in character development. Soundtracks within the show are really nice and fit in with the mood of the show and the OP and ED themes are very good too. \r\nHowever this show is really targeted at the female viewers and is very romantic though it willtake a while before it gets there but worth the wait. I love this show from beginning to end. Even at the beginning when the male lead wasn't very nice it was entertaining to watch how his feelings gradually change almost episode by episode. It's very subtle. \\n\\n\r\nThe only downside is the animation, it's mostly good but it does get a bit choppy and Naoki's character design probably suffers the most with this unfortunately. Overall, he is generally very handsome it's just some shots doesn't make him look consistently good.That's my only gripe.\\n\\n\r\nI would highly recommend this show, there have been a few scenes which brought me to tears and they are not sad scenes but probably the romantic moments. This could easily make the top 5 best romantic anime out there currently.",

Kotoko (main female character) just happens to be so obsessed by him that she is willing to accept everyting... There were time I just cheered up for side characters to conquer her because i couldnt just support to see her being more pushed down by Irie-kun.\\n\r\n   Although sweet Kotoko is heartbroken in more than the first-half of the anime, that was the good part because it touch our feelings. After that is just enjoyable to watch but it does not addict as much as the first episodes.",

Doesn't mean we don't get a few laughs when it hits some rocks and trees along the way, but in the end, it's still rather startling to see how low a series can sink from a promising starting point. \r\nImagine a love story between a noble prince, whose only fault is his perfection, and a female slave on a pirate ship, whose only redeeming quality is the constancy of her failures. Along the way, our hero and heroine face earthquakes and dividingchasms, thunderstorms, battle of the gods, and epic Homeric warfares to test the quality of their love for each other. _Kiss_ is the modern epitome of the superfluous, overwritten romantic comedy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters? What characters? Characters are either plain-looking and stupid but kind-hearted, or porcelain-like gorgeous and inhumanely intelligent but cold and silent (on the outside, of course. &quot;Deep down inside,&quot; we all know they are really lacking whatever it is that only the stupid, plain-looking characters can supply. Aah, the &quot;secret weakness&quot; that makes them human). Just mix and match those character traits between the sexes and you've pretty much covered most of the character interaction that can be found in _Kiss_.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds, however, are excellent. The ambiance supports the circumstances rather unobtrusively, heightening whatever tension left in the poorly written script without bringing attention to themselves. The opening and the endings could easily chart my personal top anime soundtrack as well. \\n\\n\r\nDespite all its faults, I watched through the series rather painlessly, as much as I hate to admit it. _Kiss_ manages to stay faithful to its light-hearted comedy and well-timed jokes. Watch this to appease those dead brain cells of yours while eating pork skins and potato chips for maximum pleasure.",

Itazura na Kiss brings a rare story to the genre of rom-com anime. Paradoxically, it's a realistic portrayal of how romantic relationships progress and develop in real life. \r\nI adore this anime. I love romantic comedies, and I'm somewhat ashamed to admit that I've watched most of the shoujo anime that there is to watch, but Itazura na Kiss stands heads above the rest just because it's realistic and endearing. \r\nIt's not overly sappy or cheesy, but it's beautifully romantic. There's not a frustrating endingwith you demanding more of the main couple; you get a sense of closure and satisfaction with how their lives progressed. There's a remarkable portrayal of the struggles that couples go through--not everything is black and white, and not everything is a fairy tale. I have no criticism. I loved every minute of this anime, and I've watched it repeatedly.",

You'll keep on telling yourself as you watching, \"Oh, this will be the episode when he stops being an a**hole.\" Nope. It never happens. And she's just so blindly loyal to him! Like get a grip girl and kick him to the curb!nope. This anime isn't disappointing, its unsettling. It left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I totally expected Irie to like see the error of his ways. Nope. And the worst part is that the show totally teases you, like an episode will end on a good note so that you actually expect Irie to be a good decent human being in the next episode. Nope. Sorry-not-sorry. Whats most unsettling is all the praise this show gets. Do girls really like guys like Irie? He's the worst! If you are a guy, at least, please do not watch this, unless you wish to be deeply disturbed.",

            "content": "In a word : 'awkward'. \r\nItazura na Kiss is an anime that wants you to genuinely care for the relationship of a girl with the intelligence of a sea urchin and a guy with a capacity for love equal to that of a dead fly. Worse yet, that riveting \"love\" story is set against the background of even more equally nonsensical and brain numbing tales of how two completely incompatible people can be brought together for no reason whatsoever. You will gain a new ability after watching this cocktail of outlandish romance - the ability to pulverise anything with a single headbutt. \r\nWarning, some SPOILERSmight be involved.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, the male lead is an ambitionless, heartless and emotionless monster. Then there happens to be a brain dead girl who falls in love with him because he's \"cool\". Now how the lack of ambition, empathy and emotion can make one \"cool\" is beyond me but what follows afterwards is a story that was pulled straight from someone's ass.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence the guy doesn't give a shit. He treats her horrendously, humiliates her in front of others and generally waits for the moment to give her the slip. The girl on the other hand keeps repeating the same retarded statement all throughout the show \"I love him, he's cool.\" That's it - end of story. \\n\\n\r\nWell, end of main story that is. We (the watchers) will still be treated to other anally extracted sub-stories throughout this 25 episodes of pure misery. A woman from the British royal familly marrying a Japanese chef (we know that happens every day). A perverted sensei who wants to get into the pants of his students. A kid who grows up to be an asshole because other people are... assholes. Absolutely riveting. In some cases, some of those sub-stories could have been interesting if executed in the proper way, Itazura na Kiss does everything but that however. \\n\\n\r\nThe coup de grace comes in the last few episodes of this anally grand anime. Enter Keita Kamogari. The ONLY rational, realistic, and emotionally engaging character. The only one to truly care for another human being for what they really are. Nah, fuck him. Swept under the carpet by the writer like an irradiated cockroach. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the drama that binds all these characters and allows the progression from one plot device to another just doesn't exist and when it does it's unbelievably superficial and feels as though it was written by a 6 year old. Same goes for comedy. It is by far the worst I've seen in any anime to date. As an example - in one of the episodes the brain dead girl is stopped, grabbed and nearly dry humped by a burly american policeman. When the emotionless monster intervenes it turns out she didn't understand him (the policeman) and he only wanted to know if she got lost. HA-HA-HA. Take notes kids. If you want to know if someone got lost, grab their arms, get as close to them as possible and thrust your pelvis into their abdominal area. \\n\\n\r\nThe only two good points would be the art and sound. The OST did contain some interesting pieces, too bad they had to be accompanied by such an awful anime. The art itself was alright although it did lose its focus fairly often. The most well drawn characters were the sea urchin and emotionless monster. Every other character was drawn with less care all the way to the insignificant background characters which took on various shapes, from lamppost like figures to curious levitating black blobs. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Itazura na Kiss is the equivalent of an exploding anus. It's full of shit.",

This series is truely something of a masterpiece in character develpment.\r\nThe story line is the classic love story with a small twist, of course I won't go into detail, you'll have to see for yourself! The music kind of reminded me a lot of the same in different animes, but stillit catchy and if there is ever a chance to get my hands on the soundtrack, I certianly will!\\n\\n\r\nUnless you get really into your anime, you might not feel the deep feelings that the characters have. When Kotoko cried, I cried. When she laughed, I smiled and laughed with her. When she made a complete fool of herself ... I laughed at her. But when I watch shows, I get pulled into them. So when I watched each episode, there were partes that I cried, both in sadness and happiness.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're looking for an anime with the same ol' story but a different twist and something a little more, Itazura na Kiss is a series you should look into.

I decided to try another shoujo to see if I really have a problem with shoujo anime, and I think yes, I don't like shoujo animes.\r\nItazura na Kiss is really funny and I was marathoning it, until something happens in ep 14 and I was like WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?!?!? It was way to fast and I didn't see it coming. After this I decided to watch one more episode and then even though it was still funny I was like \"I don'tcare for what is happening from now on\" so I dropped AGAIN.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is I don't like the male-lead character (He is too perfect, and too boring), so I wanted Kotoko to stay with any other guy that liked her instead of Irie. I was expecting her to grow up and change her behaviour. But forget it, you are not goint to see any kind of development in her and his character. It is just ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is based in a manga written in 1990, so a lot of concepts about relationships changed since the manga was written. And I understand it, but it was unbearable to me (because Kotoko was so dependent of Irie and she didn't have any creative ideas on her own, she is just following him around...). So I dropped in ep 15 and I don't regret. \\n\\n\r\nMy grade is 6 because I enjoyed the ending song hahah and because first episodes were really nice/funny and I had hope that the story was going to develop to something better.",

The story is that a girl who is in class F has had a crush on a guy since 8th grade however he is in class A and a jerk. The story goes on with the girl never giving up on her crush. I loved this show and recommend it to any shoujo romance fans as it breaks barriers. This show is very different as it focuses on the pain of love and not automatically just in love.",

Its about a girl trying to win over the love of a boy who doesnt love her, atleast thats what he claims. The part i enjoyed the most from this anime is how she step by step got through to him, she made herself get accepted by him. The girl in this anime is kind,stubborn and not that smart. The boy in this anime is very smart and has a stubborn and kinda mean character, which makes it harder to approachhim. The boy annoys the girl alot, what I really enjoy seeing. I gave the storyline a 8 because the storyline was so interesting I just couldnt stop watching. I was so curious about how the anime would end that I watched it all in 1 day. The art wasnt that bad, it actually fits the anime perfectly. Both protagonist have an unique character just the opposite of each other, which makes their relation a bit complicated. You can cleary see the jealousy they feel to each other, even if they try to hide it. The story gets completed by adding funny parts along the romace parts, it makes the story easier to watch without getting tired. I enjoyed myself thoroughly while watching which is why i gave the story an overal score of 8.",

            "content": "I happened to stumble upon this little pearl of an anime while browsing for something new to watch. Even though the recommendations were very positive, I was a little bit hesitant due to the possibility of yet another shojo with identical plot and storyline - but boy, was I surprised :) And pleasantly so, no less. Sure, in general \"Itazura na kiss\" isn't that inventive - most components of a classic \"boy and girl meet, go through a struggle of some kind, and end up happy\"-shojo, but there's just something in the way the story is told, that is too compelling to not make youengrossed by this anime. And that actually says pretty much since I am a cynical person and get very bugged over sugarcoated sugar mixed with sugar, which usually is the case with a lot of shojos. I like Kare Kano, Hana Kimi, Hot Gimmick and a few other shojos, but generally I tend to avoid them since they don't give me very much. (Sure, I have a couple of exceptions like \"Ouran\" and Fruits basket - which are kind of silly - but I like 'em anyway.) I tend to stick to other types of anime and manga, but a well told love story is kind of universal and should be recognizable for anyone. \\n\\n\r\nThis is hilarious and entertaining at the same time as it's romantic and serious. The weird thing is that it actually even pulls it off. But I say as another viewer mentioned in a recommendation somewhere - what's up with all the excessive ER-visits? Boy, are they prone to illness and accidents in the Irie-family... Also I wonder what makes that baka girl so extremely attractive to all guys out there in her world... She IS, as Naoki says - annoying, loud, stupid and silly... \\n\r\nSometimes, the story takes a pretty slow pace and becomes slightly repetative, but it doesn't really bother, it kind of stresses the fact that \"Itazura na kiss\" actually spans a long period of time. This isn't really the kind of anime with cliffhangers or made to make you bite your fingernails. This is more of a story about two people that go through a lot to end up together, and it's a pure joy to follow them along the way :)\\n\\n\r\nKotoko is one of the most embarrassing idiots I've ran across in any manga/anime, but she is a very sweet idiot :) Naoki makes me swoon as the stupid tsundere moe I am (ah - we always fall for it - such a victory to cure the evil and bring forth the inner softness of a jerk... but hey, news flash... some of the jerks are actually jerks even deep inside...) \\n\r\nActually, I like all the characters. Kinnosuke, who was extremely annoying in the beginning, kind of harrassed himself into my heart pretty fast, and he would probably be my favourite character of the cast :) And also, I personally love Jinko, although a lot of folks seem to find her annoying - her insanely horrible voice and weird personality makes me laugh :)\\n\r\nI also can't help but to love Naoki's mom - she is too absurd not to adore. Also the brat Yuuki - the younger brother in the Irie family - is a pretty strong character, important for the whole picture :)\\n\\n\r\nThe art and style is pretty much standard - same flaws as in many other anime, but it holds a pretty high standard with easily recognizable characters and carefully drawn surroundings - it's not sloppy work, and that's important at least for me (who draw a lot myself). Both the art and style changes and enhances a little bit towards the end, but the change is not detectable in the looks of characters and such, only that it seems a bit cleaner and brighter, characters more carefully shaped. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all it's a great series - making one happy and cheerful, there fore the very consistent and high score. Really a little pearl among the oceans of crappy standard cut shojo. Sure, \"Itazura na kiss\" is very classic in it's storyline - but the author of the original manga really has managed to create some depth to the story, and I am happy I gave this series a chance :) It was definitely worth it. Also, I would say that I agree with all the guys I've seen praising this series are absolutely right - this isn't classic shojo in THAT sense - purely for girls - but rather this is bound to entertain any fan of anime, no matter gender or age. (Except for that it's too emotionally mature for younger kids than say, 14.) But watch it! You won't regret it :)",

            "content": "Story: It was really quite a story. I think the plot progressed at just the right pace. It does linger on Kotoko's unrequited love, but they do it tastefully. Of course, it was quite predictable since they do end up together (no shocker there). But feminists, BEWARE!\r\nArt: I liked the art style, but I don't think there was anything absolutely amazing to it, then again, I'm not much of an expert on that and I certainly don't know what to look for in this category. Most of the characters were pleasing to the eye, though. Oh, but there is the fact that, physically, most ofthe characters don't seem to change, except for Non-chan and Naoki's little brother. They do address this, though, when the police in Hawaii stops Kotoko and mentions how he thought she was an elementary school girl.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I would have given it a ten, UNTIL I heard them speak English. It was truly embarrassing, it all honesty. I adored the music they featured, but again, the way they spoke English was a real turnoff.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I really don't like that I had to give a ten to the characters. They were round and quite well developed, I think, but as mentioned above, you can tell how anti-feminist the whole show is. I really angered me, but I can't lie, I enjoyed the show. Almost all the girls in a relationship are slapped across the face at least once. I'm quite tired of anime always showing a girl in love with her superiors (money wise, I understand, funny enough, but intellectually? I'm sorry but men are no match the most women when it comes to brains. Also, what is wrong with Kotoko? Crawling after some guy? And when they're married, he get's angry at her she excuses it with \"it was my fault.\" And Chris does the same thing, but she degrades herself in order to follow that guy. I would never give a guy the light of day if they didn't already like me, and even if they did, I probably won't like them either. However, you do grow attached to the characters. The predicament is quite believable, after all. I know many a smart men and women who end up married with someone with no intelligence (only difference is that Kotoko remains loving and faithful, which I respect.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Like I said, it was credible. This Shoujo actually evolves into a Slice of Life anime, though towards the end, I think it resembles the Novelas I secretly watch sometimes. This is quite a show for someone who wants to let go of reality for a while, though it is believable, I sincerely believe a relationship like that would never last long. But it was cute after all--just like reading about magic; it's not real, but you can still dream about it =)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

But her quite passionate love letter is greeted with a definite no in a highly rude manner. Only to come home to a tumbled heap of a house after a slight earth quake jiggled Tokyo, The girl is subjected to another heart renching tragedy. The young girl and her father are welcomed to stay with her fathers old middle school friends to find that the genius boy is the eldest son! The two don't get along. In fact the boyrefuses to chat with her and even watches the train doors close in her face as she is left to be late for school. He explains coldly that he hates stupid absent minded girls. The rejection is so absolute it is embarrassing. But on one episode later he clams he could love her and even starts talking with her at school. From the beginning I sensed this anime would have a wonderfully dramatic story of how this unsuspecting and highly unlikely couple would come to be, but I was horribly annoyed and quite sad to find that this was not the case at all. This anime has let me down. I was looking for something much more startling like a life dangering drama that would bring to completely different souls into a heart changing decision. But evidently this completely unbelievable couple is inspired only after a couple days of study and a little blackmail!!! ... Disappointed. :(   I understand that I've only just started watching this, and my currentopinion is likly to change, but I was just so appalled  I needed to get this tragedy off my chest.",

            "content": "*Spoilers may slip in but I will try to be vague*\r\nI think I wanted to like this anime too much so I did go into this one with very high hopes. \r\nOverall the story is generic its been done many times before however I had heard really good things about this one.  I enjoyed moments of the anime and if you are struggling to find something to watch. I recommend it as filler. But do not go into it with high expectations or if you have just watched a strong romance anime like *say I love you*.\r\nStraight of the bat the characters really annoyedme.\\n\r\nKotoko has a crush on the smartest boy in the school ( generic right) shes clumsy and the polar opposite to him. However her feelings are posed as love... even though its stated their classrooms are very far apart. And Naoki cold shoulders anyone he deems not smart enough.\\n\r\nHer clumsyness is played up so much it really bugged me and I started to predict how the episodes would unfold. And once that happens I get bored very very fast. \\n\\n\r\nNaoki annoyed me the most, I get wanting to make your character slightly unlikable. But he is flat out rude, and often or not makes a mockery of the MC. On occasions I felt it went too far. He is played of as cold but its problematic if I find myself routing for a relationship with the sub characters and the MC. His nice points are so subtle that when they do eventually get together its confusing and a shock. \\n\r\n I felt myself trying too hard to see good in the character because I wanted the two of them to work. I also kept hoping his character would soften up and it does....2 episodes towards the end....\\n\r\nHis character also seems to get worst at times making him a complete asshat.  There is an episode where he slaps the MC. In a romance anime thats something that just flat out ruined it. Theres no call for violence even when someone is upset. He flat out treat her coldly even after they get married. And get annoyed when other men want to treat her right ...even though she has to bear him flirting with other characters or even considering snap marriage interviews. The  balance of give and take in their relationship is very one sided. At no point in the anime did I feel like rooting for the two...And I love romance animes I enjoy seeing two characters come together. By the end of this I wanted to re-watch a better anime and forget my wasted day.\\n\r\nHis character is often shunted along whenever the plot determines its appropriate.\\n\r\nThe character takes a complete 180 as he reveals he wants to marry the MC. Even though up to this point there is very little relationship development between them. \\n\r\nThe side character do not do much for me. They definately do not save the plot either. \\n\r\nNaokis brother is your generic moody over judgmental kid. The one who picks on the MC and is usually very arrogant themselves. \\n\r\nKinnosuke I felt sorry for he loved the MC since they were childhood friends. But hes used as comic relief or when the plot calls for it. He is a plot device to get the characters to realise they want to be with one another. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest sin in this anime is its Engrish....if I had to sin just one thing its the episode where two of out characters speak...very very bad Engrish. So much so I was yelling at the screen for them to speak Japanese. \\n\r\nOur American character is so poor at Engrish it just irritated me throughout the episode. Its also the episode where our Naoki decides to announce hes going to marry this girl because he likes her...Saying that knowing the MC is in earshot. And then he gets angry because her childhood friend proposes to her. \\n\r\nThe plot is very childish at times. Its a case of .... AND THEN..... AND THENNNNNNN. o.o but that may make no sense.\\n\\n\r\nEverything feels so forced and rushed. It also gave the impression the anime wanted to be a high school romance up until it got ahead of itself and started hurdling forward. Which moves me to the plot...\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is generic and I have no complaints for that, many of the anime I enjoy have standard plots. The thing I took issue with was the pacing. Outright it seemed like the plot was being rushed very quickly. This may be due to the amount of manga there is. I have not read it or even checked. Because as an anime it should stand on its own without having to read the manga. For me I pick up mangas when the anime has done such a good job I want more. \\n\r\nMaybe the anime was rushed? maybe they wanted to get to the good bits and cut out the fluff. But it needed the fluff this time around. A bit more time on actually developing feelings between the two would of helped. Or even letting us into Naokis thought process, that would of perhaps lightened my hatred towards him.\\n\r\nThe plot starts quickly, hits a U turn and full speed bolts to the finish. \\n\r\nOften of not I found myself getting confused as to what had happened and how much time had passed between events. One moment shes 17 the next shes 26. And all that happens in 25 episodes of non stop rushing.\\n\r\nThe anime starts as a high school romance but turns into a marriage gone wrong with hospital drama threw in.\\n\\n\r\nSound wise I think I was too mad to pay much attention to it, it did not really stand out.\\n\r\nThe art style to is ok its nothing special. But I can forgive that if the plot or characters make up for that...but in this case they do not. \\n\\n\r\nI do recommend checking it out if you get bored or are waiting for the new season to start. But do bear in mind its a very rushed anime which leaves characters feeling stocky and generic...or just rude.",

Some moments were animated badly and some moments were good. But I got used to the art.\r\nSOUND - 8\r\nThe opening was nice but I didn't really like the ending but it's my personal opinion.\r\nSTORY & CHARACTERS - 8\r\nA girl fell in love with a guy and tries to give him a love letter and the boy rejected him. Somehow happened that this girl's house was destroyed and the girl and her father have to live with father'sgood friend. And when they went to that house it happened that that good friend's son was the boy that rejected her. (The boy - Naoki Irie, The girl - Kotoko Aihara)\\n\r\nIrie keeps rejecting Kotoko. While she still confess her love for him. Naoki is cold like an ice or even colder and likes to say mean things. He has made Kotoko cry million times. We didn't see that he loved her until episode 14. When he proposed to her and they got married but he still continued to be like an ice. I like the cold,bad boy anime characters but not the ones like him. But when she finally got pregnant after 4 years he really changed. He was really overprotective of Kotoko but really didn't show it. He didn't like to show his emotions. But when she was pregnant he started to show them and became kinder towards her.\\n\r\n I didn't really like their love story but the main thing I liked was the change of Irie. It showed us how love can change people.\\n\r\nI loved the moments with Noriko (mother of Irie). OHGOD she was so funny. I loved her.\\n\r\nAlso I loved to see how other characters got married and have their happy life.\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nEven though I didn't like many things about this anime I still enjoyed it. I couldn't say that it was the best romance anime I have ever seen but it wasn't that bad. \\n\\n\r\n- sorry for bad english -",

I am a big fan of shoujo anime, and this is one of my favorites - if not THE favorite. \r\nAt the beginning, it looked like one typical comedy romance anime - the main character gets rejected by her beloved, that deeply despises her, but fate unites them. The characters' crazy family and friends help to make the story light and enjoyable, while the unilateral romance between Kotoko and Irie makes you want for more. Until episode 14, l was mildly enjoying it - the story was toosimilar to a lot of the ones l had watched - but it wasn't even my priority to watch it - l took almost a month to complete the series. But this anime is different from almost all shoujo anime that l had watched, for it continues after the \"happy ever after\". When almost all the other anime would end - with their love finally blooming, with the kiss, with the mutual confessions - this one continues. This anime shows what everyone imagines and wants to know after a good shoujo anime - what happened to the characters? Did their relationship work? Did they get married? Do they have kids? - what turned my mildly interest into an obsession to get to the end. l obviously recommend it, for it made me laugh and cry and feel that anything is possible if you fight for it - as Kotoko is a disaster at everything she does and gets rejected by Irie over and over again and still never gives up and gets to achieve everything she desired. If you are a fan of shoujo anime, this is one you shouldn't miss. \\n",

At first i thought Irie Naoki was a complete jerk and i thought Kotoko was a complete idiot for falling for him. But after a couple of episodes i start to like Naoki. * don't read if you haven't finished the anime* After they got married ifinally realized how perfect they were together and altogether i thought this anime was outstanding!",

            "content": "When it comes to romance in any form of entertainment I consume usually I meet it with a slight shrug. I'm in different to television or movie romantic comedies. However, when it comes to anime I have a massive soft spot. I love all the cheesiness, the characters, I even enjoy - to an extent - the cliches which come with it.\r\nItazura seemed to be right up my ally. The underdog story shown at the start is really what drew me in. I enjoy watching someone whose at the bottom rise up and disprove those who didn't believe in them. Kotoko someone who I reallywanted to see become better than how everyone seen her. I wanted her to win. I wanted her to succeed. \\n\\n\r\nBoy was I let down. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\\n\r\nItazura na Kiss's story is pretty basic. Kotoko is a young teenage girl who no one expects to become anything great. Irie, however, is on the other end of that spectrum, he's the most popular boy in school, gets good grades and comes from a very well off family. As with most romantic shows of this nature, naturally Kotoko is in love with him. After mustering up the courage to confess her love to Irie, Kotoko is met with a very mean rejection. Things get even more messy as Kotoko's father ends up having his house destroyed and the two have no other choice but to live with the Irie family. \\n\\n\r\nThe story doesn't really have much going for it. It's basic and very, very cliched - to the point where hardly I could stomach it. The only good thing about it is the time skips. We see our two main characters go from high school to college and finally into their careers. The characters themselves aren't worth much either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\\n\r\nWhile, at the start, I kind of respected Kotoko by the end of the show I was down right annoyed by her. She's very driven and hard working but as all of the standard romantic comedy tropes. She's clumsy and is a massive air-head who is constantly the butt of a joke. The show seems to enjoy making Kotoko's life down right miserable at times. When she does end up with her 'one true love' he ends up being one of the meanest people to her. I kept hoping that she'd snap out of her school girl crush and see that she could do so much better. Her only personality seems to come from being Irie's love interest. She cares only for Irie, even if it hurts her to do so. \\n\\n\r\nI hated how the show treated her and I hated that she kept letting it happen. Even when other characters were introduced, who clearly had strong feelings for her and were much better suited for her than Irie all she would do was stick by Irie. \\n\\n\r\nIrie himself is one of the worst elements of this show. I kept hoping he would finally see how amazing Kotoko was for him but all he seemed to do was find her annoying. It seemed as if he didn't care about her and all I wanted him to do was just leave her so Kotoko could run off and be happier with someone else. As the show went on I saw hints of a softer side to him but those moments were few and only really happened towards the end when Kotoko 'needed saving'.\\n\\n\r\nIrie's parents were actually very nice and I couldn't fathom how they could have created such a monster. Nor could I believe that Kotoko's father would let someone like Irie take advantage of his own child. \\n\\n\r\nThe few side characters we spend time with are okay. There's actually a transwoman in this show who I really enjoyed seeing and I wish I could have seen more of. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\\n\r\nAt times this art-style looked down right ugly. Especially when it came to side shots of a characters face, I couldn't help but wonder why everyone thought Irie was so handsome. The character designs themselves were pretty bland and generic with no one really standing out.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3\\n\\n\r\nIt's there if only to fill the need for sound. The opening and ending themes I don't even remember and were ones I always skipped.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a show with all the basic elements of a romantic comedy then Itazura na Kiss has you covered. However, there are much better shows than this one. At times I down right hated this show and how they treated Kotoko in particular. For days I left this show and only watched it in small clumps just because I kept praying that Kotoko would move on from this horrible person. Kotoko deserved way better.\\n",

And diffrently then most anime the guy in question Irie doesn't show that he's in love with Kotoko, but keeps trying to keep Kotoko by his side even though he doesn't want to accept her feelings. When does Irie fall in love with Kotoko is a big questioncuz you can see a little of his affection from the beginning of the anime.  This anime leaves you wanting for more and the comedy is good and not over the top like usually...  And the hole story is outstanding, the art in the middle of the anime gets a little worse but doesn't hinder the enjoyment of watching the anime, the soundtrack is great too (I myself love it :D), the characters are interesting especially Irie and Kotoko. If you hadn't seen it yet I recommend watching it!",

            "content": "Itazura na Kiss is, quite simply, a rather generic seeming comedic drama. The basic scenario of the plot has a rather basic structure that is, more or less, rather predictable. It's about a high school girl who is infatuated with a boy who doesn't seem to care for her whatsoever but by some mysterious twist of fate ends up living in his house due to unfortunate circumstances and the development of both the male and female protagonists. Nonetheless, Itazura na Kiss was still rather gripping and kept me peeled to the screen (I marathon-ed through it >___>) until the end. \r\nStory: 7\r\nAs mentioned above, thestory plot-line was, for the most part rather predictable and seemed to have a lot of reoccurring instances (the most noticeable being Irie's popularity and other men chasing Kotoko). There were also a few lulls in the series and then a number of rushed scenes which left more to be desired on the part of the director. It was still enjoyable and it worked rather well for the most part in forcing character development and the like.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nNow, I've never been a fan of the shoujo used in Itakiss but it is fair enough. However, being a recently aired anime, I expected a little more.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nDidn't think of it as anything remarkable but it worked well enough.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I loved most about Itakiss is its wide variety of characters ranging from Kin to Kotoko to Irie, there is a very big spectrum of personalities that make this anime rather special and even more hilarious. As far as character development goes, it felt somewhat rushed but it worked overall.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nI thought it was very entertaining and hilarious.",

I would not recommend it to someone who watches anime for action and graphic effects, although the art style is unique and fun to watch. It is simply a romance with many twists and unexpected turns that will keep you on your toes. The characters are just to die for, especially ones like Kotoko and Irie's mother! The music is nice, but some of the voices are.... interesting... and the english, well, the english is almost as funny as the jokes, so I can't really complain about it. This anime always leaves me laughing and dying to knowwhat happens next. Truly marvelous.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about Kotoko, who has had a crush on Irie for a long time. Simply put, he is smart; she is not. He rejects her immediately, but when she must move into his house because her house collapses in an earthquake and their fathers are old friends, can he resist this loveable, adorable, adventurous girl forever? It is deffinately worth your time.",

            "content": "I've found that Itazura na Kiss is one of the best romance anime I've ever come cross, rivaling even Clannad, and likely exceeding it. Yes, I said it! I will explain. (Advanced warning, this is a long and in-depth review). \r\n1. Story. (10/10)  \r\nThe Good: The plot, at first glance, really isn't anything to fawn over. Quite frankly, it's probably fairly easy to pass up on premise alone. What sets this anime apart from countless others is that it goes beyond getting the guy/girl. It shows humans being human (usually in a funny, over-the-top manner). It has its ups and down, happy moments, sadmoments, and it completely immerses you into their world. This anime goes beyond confessions, a kiss, or school life. You see hardship. You see struggle. You see tears. You see joy. You see yearning. You see desire. You see...life. You rarely get that in this type of anime.\\n\\n\r\n2. Sound. (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe Good: The voice acting in this amine, in my opinion, is absolutely perfect. The voice actors did a phenomenal job portraying these characters. It didn't feel like voice acting- it felt like they really WERE the characters. Needless to say when the voice actors of Irie-kun and Kotoko made cameo appearances in the latest live-action I squealed like a fangirl for days with instant replays at the ready. \\n\\n\r\nThe Bad: While not exactly bad, the soundtrack wasn't memorable for me. I've watched this anime a few times, and I no matter how often I watch it, the music is just...okay. It does what it needs to do, but that's about it. I give it a high score of 9 in this regard simply because of the voice acting. \\n\\n\r\n3. Art. (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe Good: It was cute. Given the kind of anime it is (and the year), I found the art to be very effective and pleasing. It was smooth and set the moods to perfection. The facial features and body language says what words can't, and the scenes are easy on the eyes, earning it a solid 9. \\n\\n\r\nThe Bad (why it's not a 10): Call me bias, but Irie-kun was simply not believable as a high-school student (at the end of the day, you have to blame the mangaka artist for this). From the very beginning he looked like a man in his mid-20s. While there were times he looked younger, overall- his design didn't appeal to me. The same can be said of a few others as well. This is, of course, my opinion. I also didn't like how the story encompasses so long a time, yet only one person aged.  Irie Yuuki (Naoki's little brother) was the only one to be marked by the passage of time, and quite drastically. His growing up from a boy to a young adult was the only real sign that significant time passes by in the anime, which might make it confusing at times since time skips aren't always in-your-face obvious. \\n\\n\r\n4. Characters. (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nKotoko: If you want a laugh, Kotoko delivers. She's over-the-top, determined, hopeless, idiotic (I say this in a nice way), and simply a delight to watch. However, she's can also be extremely irritating, even more so than Irie-kun. To her credit, she grows a lot during the series, but in the end she may leave you scratching your head asking why she still behaves in such a childish manner. I'll give credit where it's due: she's consistent, if nothing else. \\n\\n\r\nIrie Naoki (aka: Irie-kun): Let's face it, Irie-kun is a jerk. I'm assuming most of us know this. If not, now you know. I think it's safe to say no woman in her right mind would waste her time on him. Luckily for us, Kotoko doesn't think as I do. In the anime more-so than the live-action counterparts, you can't find too many endearing qualities about him. That being said, Irie-kun grows a lot. More than anyone else, I think, and it's utterly amazing to watch his transformation from heartless cad to emotional human at the end. \\n\\n\r\nThe minor characters were enjoyable and get their chance to shine. Kin-chan, especially. These minor and supporting characters really bring the anime to life. Because it takes place over the course of several years, you get to see everyone's lives as they develop and change. While the main focus is on Irie-kun and Kotoko, it does an okay job of keeping you up to date on other characters. \\n\\n\r\nIrie-kun x Kotoko: Their relationship is utterly believable and a perfect example of a yin-yang couple in terms of personality and how they complete one another. By the end of the series, you can feel the love they have for each other.  They make it real. It's not forced and the pace of their romance is understandable, considering. No matter how often I watch it,  they leave me speechless in my respect for their relationship by the end of the series. It is largely for this reason that this section gets a 9 from me, despite the individual character flaws. \\n\\n\r\n5. Enjoyment : (10/10) \\n\\n\r\nThe Good: The plot was consistent, didn't leave any loose ends, and leaves you with a happy feeling and a sense of loss because it's over. When it was over, I think I went into withdraw and had to immediately watch it again. To put it lightly, I was obsessed. I've ended up reading the manga and watched every live-action adaptation (including the newest one that recently finished airing). So yeah, I'd say I my enjoyment was great. \\n\\n\r\n6. Overall. (10/10) \\n\\n\r\nI, and fans of this anime, are probably just happy that the anime was completed considering the mangaka died before the manga was finished. Thanks to notes left behind, the anime effectively ended the story in the best way possible, and not just for the main characters. This manga/anime spurred three unforgettable live-action adaptations (more than that if you count seasons separately) and I couldn't ask for anything more. Sure, I can sit and wonder how much better the anime COULD HAVE been, but that's not going to change what this is. And that's a great anime for what it's meant to be. In my opinion, no other romantic anime I've seen has come anywhere close to matching it, making it about as close to a masterpiece as a romance anime can get. \\n",

            "content": "How do I put this. The story was interesting to begin with, but it got very predictable and boring fast. What annoyed me most about the story was how easily I knew what was going to happen. I could say \"He's going to become a doctor now,\" and then he did. Not once was I surprised by what happened. The art was okay. It definitely wasn't the best, but nor was it the worst.\r\n Now the sound. The sound was alright, except for Jinko, and some of the sound effects. I don't mean to offend the voice actor, but Jinko's voice was very annoying andI think the voice actor went overboard with it.\\n\\n\r\n Now it's time for my biggest problem with this anime. The characters. Kotoko is completely and utterly useless and helpless, not to mention she has no self respect. I get that some things are hard to do, but nobody is bad at everything. She can't even walk 2 steps without messing up. Not to mention she let herself be bullied and treated like crap just because she had a crush on some guy. Now on to Irie. I get the whole \"Cold- hearted misunderstood know-it all\" thing they're trying to do. But he honestly was a huge jerk to her. But then out of the blue he kisses her and she falls for him again. He repeatedly ignores her and then goes out with another girl, treats her like crap, and then asks her to marry him. What kind of relationship is like that? (if you're in a relationship like that, I suggest to get out of it as fast as possible, or find a way to communicate) Irie is actually quiet mean. The supporting characters were more interesting, and seemed to have more depth then Irie. Not to mention that the characters don't change. It goes from their senior year of high school, to when they have their own daughter, and Kotoko is still a mess and completely usless, and Irie is still mean and doesn't show her an affection. Even her daughter makes fun of Kotoko. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I'm not going to totally trash on it. If you're looking for a light-hearted anime and don't really mind if it's perdictable, then I would recommend it. It was a little heart warming seeing them grow-up and I did feel a bit happy for them (I'm not completely heartless), but it wasn't a very good story and plot. Overall it was mediocre, wouldn't mind watching it again if I really had too, but it's the characters personalities, especially Irie's that make it a 4.",

You know the ones where you thought where like fairy tales when you where young but upon closer inspection when you got older you realised that they where pretty messed up .\r\nLike those Itazura Na Kiss is about a poor , clumsy , insecure girl with a rough past falling in love with a rich , handsome and smart jerk with a pretty shallow life . The two start living together by a twist of fate and Irie asthe stereotypical jerk that he is beggins to bully Kotoko non stop . Up until episode 14 or so anyway because Kotoko's cheerfulness eventually wins him over because it makes his life more exciting and they get married .\\n\\n\r\nIf you have seen any soap operas then you have seen this premise about a million times before and that's not so bad after all this anime was primarily made for young girls.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that just like some Telenovelas there is zero character progression here . Even after they get married Irie still treats his wife like dirt so naturally i expected Kotoko to eventually overcome her insecurities and leave Irie for good or make him realise his wrong doings\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately nothing changes not even after Irie hits Kotoko for standing up to him thus making this show feel .....shallow...It really made me think that the only reason Kotoko is staying with him is because of Irie's money and fame which I bet wasn't the reaction they wanted \\n\\n\r\nIf the moral of the story was to show the viewer an abusive relationship based on fears and insecuritites from both parties then my review would be different but that's not the case as the show tries pretty hard to convince you that what you are seeing is normal\\n\\n\r\nI know this show is beloved and I respect that but I personally found nothing of worth here \\n\\n\r\n3/10 (Poor)\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading :)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime is one of the most infuriating, secondhand-embarassment-inducing, annoying shows I ever have or will watch. The main character is completely two-dimensional; her only driving  motivation in life is to be close to, and try to win over, her holier-than-thou douche-nozzle of a love interest. There is no character growth at all over the course of the series; she annoys him into settling for her, and then she rides off into the sunset towards a life of utter mediocrity. \r\nStory: 4. Bleh. I went into this exciting for a story that is 'not your typical highschool romance', but what I got? Ew. Putit back where it came from plz.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7. The art itself was fine. It's not exactly memorable, but there's nowhere that it was really lacking, either. It was just kinda \"meh, alright, that's fine\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3. I won't even go into all the things that are wrong and lacking with the characterization. The one thing that I will say, is that Irie (male lead) has absolutely no redeeming qualities from my perspective. And the female character is obviously not only clueless, but completely lacking in self-respect to put up with his shit. It borders on abusive; the image of a dog being repeatedly mistreated and beaten by its owner, and then crawling back oblivious wagging its tail, comes to mind. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4. I kept hoping it was going to get better, and when it became clear it wasn't, I thought I owed it to the show to keep on going to the very end. But in reality, I quit a few episodes after that. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5. It was just... ew. I know a lot of people like it, and if I squint I can hazard a couple loose guesses as to why, but it still really doesn't make sense to me.",

            "content": "Itazura Na Kiss gets a lot of mixed reviews. Some love, others hate it. I am one of the ones who love it. Itazura Na Kiss is one of the few romance amines out there that actually follows the characters lives outside of highschool. It is also unique in the way that the main couple doesn't actually get together until they are in college.\r\nStory: As I said earlier, this story is a unique one. Sure, it starts off with the cliche klutz of a girl with a huge crush on the popular highschool genius. And it does remind me of Lovely Complex, in how themain girl is persistent in winning the heart of her true love. But think, in this industry, is anything original anymore? Anyway, the main guy, Naoki rejects the love the main girl, Kotoko. All throughout the years, she still consistently tries to win over Naoki. She faces trial after trial, but eventually, Naoki budges and realizes that he does have feelings for her. He treated her badly up until this point, but that is understandably, at least from my perspective. I believe he treats her badly because he can't come to terms with his own feelings about her, so even though he begins to fall for her, he still treats her the same way he did when he had none at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style is doable. Sure, it's a bit old, but I have no complaints about it. It's very bearable, and the colors are still vibrant. The art style is consistent all throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: At least for me, the characters are the type of characters that grow on you. I didn't like any of the characters at first, with the exception of the parents surprisingly. But as time went on, as the characters grew older and started to face trials of their own, even for some of the minor characters, they began to grow on me one by one. By the time the show ended, I liked each of the characters and didn't wish them to be any different. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development however, was very little. Aside from the characters falling in love with each other, their actions are pretty much the same as their younger selves. Naoki's brother went through the most character development.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: By the second half, I enjoyed this show very much. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys he romance genre, especially to the ones who are looking for one that goes beyond the highschool first kiss. 7/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "NOT SPOILER FREE!!\r\nOk first review. The reason i decided to review this was just to let people know if they should watch this anime or not. The plot and characters and what i say 'how the story plays out' plays a HUGE part ( obviously) in the enjoyment of this series. \r\nFirst of all i'd like to say i am not a fan of romance and shojou but have watched a fair share of these genres. This was my first romance anime. At first i liked it. Then i rewatched it and noticed problems.\r\nSTORY:-5/10\r\nThe story is simple. A stupid, cutesy girl falls in love witha handsome intelligent guy. The guy does not accept her first. Then because of destiny she suddenly ends up at his house. They have many moments. He teases her. She never gives up. blah blah blah stuff happens annnnddd.....DONE! They end up together. A very cliche and simple story. Not bad.\\\\n\\n\r\nArt:-7/10\\n\r\n I'm going to make this short. The art was pretty good. The characters were good looking and overall effects weren't bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:-3/10\\n\r\nPersonally i think they went wrong with the characters. The personalities were so damn annoying and cliche that.....i....the cringe is REAL!!\\n\r\nKotoko- Your usual short cute girl EVERYONE falls in love with even though she is annoying and with a stupid personality...like she has no good qualities. She is literally a five year old stuck in a high schoolers body.\\n\r\nIrie Naoki- your typical tough intelligent douche who doesn't want to admit he loves her. He doesn't have too much of a bad quality. His best quality imo is that he is good  looking. That's it.\\n\r\nOthers- there were alot of unnecessary characters. Some good characters some bad. \\n\\n\r\nNow the annoying thing is kotoko and how she acts and does things. I think they should have made her character a little less...a teensy weensy less ANNOYING AND CLICHE CUTE DUMB GIRL EVERYONE LOVES FOR SOME REASON!!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:-5/10\\n\r\nMinus the cringe and cliche i still liked it a bit. It was an ok anime. If this is your first anime u might like it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\ni give it a six. It is enjoyable at times. At times u wanna  kill yourself from triggerrreeddd orr crrinngee attacks. But then again it is ok  compared to other animes. If  u love romance shojou, or don't mind cliches u will like this anime. If u don't like cliches and annoying characters i would still suggest u see if u like it. But if u don't want to watch it it doesn't make any difference in life.  \\n\r\nSTAY SAFE AND WATCH GOOD ANIME..PEACE!!",

It's like a yummy food that has a terrible after taste. I wanted to finish watching this anime but, I stopped after episode 17. It made me mad when the guy took the girls first kiss, and then bullied her about it. That's not something that should ever be ok. There are things in life that i think are so precious, and so that is why this anime irritated me so much. Although it is just ananime so I dont really care. But I was bored and felt like leaving a review. Keeping everything in mind, I would say that this anime is very adorable. Since I am not a very patient person, I just couldn't deal with this anime.",

At first i was reluctant to start waching this series but im a sucker for romance animes so i started watching this anime with the intentions of it taking me while to finish it.\r\n I did it in 2 days the story 7/10 is pretty original with the slight similarities to other shoujo romance animes but over all the story kept me intrested eonough to want to watch it and not so much to watch itbecause i started it\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 and sound 9/10 The art was a little different from other shoujo anime but it was very well done. the soundtrack for this anime were great in my opinion i didn skip them everytime i started a new episode so music ws good\\n\\n\r\ncharacter 9/10 This has to be my favorite part of this anime all of the characters were different and enjoyable to have on screen when their time came the main charaters (kotoko and Naoki) were different and i enjoyed that. on top of that u have the Irie family and kotoko's friends and u have a great cast for this anime \\n\\n\r\n8/10 As i staed before the anime was a joy to start and finish and it didnt feel that at any point i had to forcibly watch an episode for the sake of starting what i finished\\n\\n\r\nMy over all score 7/10 Dont be surprised, yes i gave this anime high marks but the way its blended together is weird sometimes the anime slows down hen speeds up and then its a dead stop. theres a difference betwwen liking an anime and knowing its good or bad \\n\\n\r\nMy final thoughts are if u like romance anime of any kind WATCH this anime i enjoyed it dont let the shoujo scare u off if you are a guy.it was a joy to spend these 2 days watching it and i hope you like it too.\\n\\n\r\nthank you for reading this review i want to state that this is MY OPINION and this review is just to let u know whats up i believe any anime deserves to be watched so that said enjoy and feel free to recommend me ANYTHING --Dezperado\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ok time to write a way better review. Itazura na kiss (Mischevous kiss) is about a highschool girl named Kotoko who is in the least smarted class the F class. She falls in love with Irie who is in the A class and is a genuis. She finally gets the courage to comfess her love to him in a love letter and he doesn't even accept the letter saying he hates dumb girls. On that very day her house collapses and she is forced to live with Irie. She tries to make him love her back.\r\nThe story follows them all the way from highschoolto after college. So the story moved really fast. I really loved the story and some times it made me do my fan girl scream or maybe even cry. I could really relate to her unrequited love situation so I just kept on watching. The begging was hilarious the middle was touching and the end was so happy.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was ok except for the fact is that I felt like they were slacking a bit trying to copy the original mangaka art. Sometimes Kotokos face looked really round and way to childish and sometimes Irie looked REALLY UGLY when he is supposed to be Kotokos  Love. I wish he would have looked better. But there were times where he did look hot.\\n\\n\r\nI dont really no much about the sound. The voice characters were great in expressing feeling and even though i can't really understand japanese I found it easy with teir tone of voice that went well with the characters personality. Also the music was AWESOME I loved the ending song and the oppening song got stuck in my head.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were good too except for the fact is that sometimes you could really hate the character that your supposed to love like Irie. He was a jerk to her and was too mean to her and couldn't show feelings for her. Also Keita and Ken should have made a bigger affect on her.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime because it kept on getting better as you went. It felt like the characters were people and they had feelings. Also this is funny too so It isn't deep or depressing. It was touching.\\n\\n\r\nOverally This anime was Awesome the story was beautiful, the art was good the sound was great and I really enjoyed it. You should watch Ita Kiss if you want something like a touching romantic comedy. If there was a contest in that category this would win BIG TIME. :)",

But I was pleasantly surprised to find how much I enjoyed it.\r\nIt was really the characters that pulled the whole thing together for me. From kotoko's never give up attitude, to the supporting casts comedic ways, each episode always left a smile on my face. The whole anime is pretty lighthearted, but theirare some dramatic moments since it is a shojo after all. I suggest it to anyone who wants a good laugh, and loves a good colorful cast of characters.",

Usually shoujo stories have a very basic goal, for the main characters to get together and don't usually explore what goes on afterwards.\r\nHaving said that, I do see why some people don't like it. True it is a very typical shoujo storyline and the main characters can be slightly irritating, frustrating and or annoying at times, but I have to say that I LOVE THIS SHOW. A lot  of peoples complaints are about the main female lead, but in many ways I find her quite relatable, being someone who is a bit clumsy and not that graceful. I am fully aware of the faults and to be honest if you wanting something rich in story detail or in depth plot then maybe you should give it a miss. But if you want something that's easy going and fun to watch then give it a go.",

            "content": "Itazura na Kiss. At first I had no idea what this show was, that is, until I saw the English title: Mischievous or Playful Kiss. That's when I realized, I had seen this title before. It was from a Korean Drama called Playful Kiss that I had tried watching a couple of years ago. I couldn't get past the first three episodes. I remember thinking the female protagonist was a total moron for chasing after the douchebag main male character who treated her like garbage. It annoyed me so much I had to stop watching it.\r\nNow I found the original source's anime adaptation, and well,I was able to sit through it all at least.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, you could look at this show two ways. Either, it's a story about a kind, loyal, devoted young woman who falls for an emotionally stunted young man, and as a result of her steadfast love for him, he grows emotionally and becomes a better man who learns how to cherish her. OR. It's about a hopeless silly girl who, due to mere shallow attraction for a smart, good looking kid, winds up in a somewhat abusive relationship, cloying for whatever affection he decides to give her; oh, and she wears him down till he ends up liking her back.\\n\\n\r\nMy emotional side wants to see this show from the first perspective, but my sensible side leans more towards the latter. Let's just say, if this were a real couple, her friends and family would be practically begging her to leave him no matter how good looking or smart he is. Naoki Irie is NOT good boyfriend material, ladies, and even though he changes near the end, don't expect a real person to. It doesn't always turn out that way. That being said, it was sweet to see how he does seem to fall in love with Kotoko, even if that does finally happen only in the last six episodes or so.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I would say this show is all right. Most of the characters are very likable (I found myself rooting for Kotoko's guy friend and an exchange student more than I was for her and Naoki), and it's not too hard on the eyes, I suppose. I just wish the payoff to the whole series had come sooner than later. Plus, did they REALLY have to make Kotoko have a jealous fight with her KID over Naoki?? Give me a break.",

            "content": "SLIGHT SPOILERS. READ AT OWN RISK.\r\nMost romance animes are quite slow paced, and is usually boy chase girl or girl chase boy. Heck, it takes the whole season just to get a confession. But Itazura na Kiss is different. What happens after the confession? Do they get married? Do they have a family? In this anime, you get to see their life about 10 years after they first meet.\r\nThe story is considered a classic. It was made in the 90's afterall, so there may be some cliques here and there. Not so bright, but super determined girl (Kotoko) chases smart, handsome, cold boy (Naoki). HonestlyI was kind of annoyed at the characters in the beginning but I quickly changed my opinion after just a few episodes. Kotoko (the main girl) can't cook, is clumsy, and one of the dumbest people in school, but she sure has determination. That's where she shines. For the 10% that Naoki can't do, she can do it like no one else can. \\n\\n\r\nEach character has their own unique personality and looks. They all stand out on their own. (The mom is really funny! and supportive. of their love. yes.) Also, you'll be seeing a lot of character development (even with the supporting characters that are only there for 2 episodes). \\n\\n\r\nThe story was predictable but I enjoyed it. There's alot of comedy thrown here and there. It was pretty funny. I found myself laughing aloud at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing was SUPERIOR. You see them grow up. So many things happen just in one episode. I thought one part was rushed and unrealistic but that may be just me.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style also really reminds me of the 90s. Perhaps due to respect of the author? (It reminded me alot of Sailor Moon). I was bothered by the proportions at times and Naoki's eye placement (lol) but it's all good. It fits well with what they do in the anime. It's not the best, but it works! (Heck, the side characters even look like two of the characters in Sailor Moon!) Another reason why it is so different from other romance animes! (Don't get me wrong, the animation is good and it flows.)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was amazing. Ok I only recall like 3 songs they used but I can tell you the opening and ending (especially the 2nd one) is really good. It also reminded me of back then, and it was calming. Voice actors fit well.\\n\\n\r\nMany people say this anime is really realistic. I didn't think so the first few episodes (I think you know what I mean if you watched it but I don't want to spoil more LOL) but I saw it after some time.. Dreams, determination, limits, family problems, marriage, jealousy, unfortunate moments. Everything is there.\\n\\n\r\nI think you'll like this series alot. Whether or not you like romance. It was really enjoyable and unique. I think I can watch it like 50 times.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly I was so emotionally attached to this anime. It's one of my favorite romance animes. I finished it in under 24 hours..(but that's because I had an unintentional all nighter cause I couldn't sleep so I got up earlier BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT) I really loved the couple and how you see the cold man in the beginning open up. I liked seeing everyone in the future. I felt like I was growing up with them. It was really heartwarming but also sad. I cried. LOL\\n\\n\r\nAnd then I cried myself to sleep knowing this fact... (You should probably read this after you watched it)\\n\\n\r\nItazura na Kiss was first published as a manga in 1990 by Kaoru Tada. Since then (as of Jan. 3 2015) there has been 4 drama adaptions and 1 anime adaption, however she would only witness one in her lifetime due to an unfortunate, unseen death. In 1999, she hit her head on a marble table while moving into a new home. She suffered from cerebral hemorrhage. She went into a coma and died 3 weeks later. The manga was never completed, but the husband told the animators how she intended to end it, so this would be the first adaptation with the \"real ending\".\\n\\n\r\nIt took 18 years since it was first published for it to become an anime. And then 6 years more to be on DvD.\\n\\n\r\nDid you cry. I cry everytime. SHE WOULD NEVER SEE HER SUCCESS\\n\\n\r\nAnyway..thank you so much for reading my review. This was my first one and I'm not really good with putting my feelings into words. I tried my best not to put in side comments but it's too hard. Sorry.\\n\\n\r\nPlease watch this anime. Please.",

Itazura na kiss entertained me, and gave me smiles and laughs in EVERY SINGLE EPISODE. There may have been moments i did not like, characters voices that were sub par at times (jinko) and some cliche anime moments. However, the anime never disappointed me. I got to see a very likable female character fall in love, and have the relationship grow. Rather than most animes ending it when they get together, youget to see what happens after that. The fact that i am a guy, and this anime left a lasting impression of happiness on me was more than enough for me to leave a review to say just that. The whole is greater than the sum of its part on this one. 10/10 overall enjoyment for me!",

            "content": "To be honest Itazura na Kiss is probably my favorite pure straight romance anime for a few reason that A LOT of romance anime lack entirely. You can skip to the end for a quick summary, alright getting into it...\r\nStory: 9\r\nConsidering this is a romance anime there's really not much in terms of actual plot, so I tend to talk about the relationship between the leads and how they progress in this section and damn does this anime do it right. This anime goes extremely far in the relationship and I can legit count on 1 hand the amount of anime that actually goes thisfar, even less if its an actual romance anime. To be specific and kind of spoilerly this anime actually goes up to having kids, most tend to end at a kiss at most, and if your lucky marriage, however this goes all the way. A lot of people think a kiss is the height of a romantic relationship but that's only the beginning, the real height of any relationship is the point where you trust and love each other enough to raise a child. More notable moments like the confession is perfect as it happens at a moment of the story where substantial time has been dedicated to developing the relationship making it all the more satisfying while leaving enough time to develop the relationship even further and this show most certainly does that. I think I should also mention, as the name implies, a lot of kissing happens in this anime if your looking for that.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nProbably the worst part of the show. Animation isn't super important, once again, because this is a romance anime, but actual presentation makes the anime look even older than it actually is. Backgrounds aren't very detailed. Generally the anime is not very good looking and is passable at best. You could say its trying to emanate a novel esque look similar to Kimi no Todoke however it kind of fails at this, as that kind of look works better in a more serious and less goofy show and this show certainly has its goofy and comedic moments, which would be fine if they changed the entire look during these more comedic moments but they keep its novel esque overlay during these moments which doesn't really work\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nSound didn't really stick out to me. Voice acting was descent and sfx was reasonable. The ost is not spectacular and non of the pieces stuck out, pretty average all in all. Sound is something that's just kind of glossed over in this anime. (I did personally like ED 2 tho)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nA lot of people seem to dislike the anime or even drop it because of the characters primarily the male mc, Irie Naoki, and I have to agree, at times Naoki can be incredibly self-centered and an asshole on all levels. However his disposition towards Kotoko tends to makes sense in the context of the story, like (spoilers ahead) getting afraid that Kotoko would stop loving him as he wants her to love him as he loves her in return (spoilers end here). Also, most of Naoki's actions and attitude towards Kotoko tend to be only really innocent teasing I think a lot of people misunderstand this teasing for a shitty personality. It's also not like he sees NO change throughout the show, he does learn to value Kotoko more and comes to understand things about life that he previously wouldn't have without her. Kotoko herself is pretty enjoyable, instead of being stupidly in love with Naoki she likes to try hard hoping one day to 1 up him. Supporting cast is pretty awesome, especially Naoki's mom. They all actually feel like the role they are supposed to fill in our leads' lives. Antagonist like meaningless love rivals don't last very long and they all play important roles in moving Naoki and Kotoko's relationship forward. Ultimately helping to deliver a much bigger emotional payback in the climaxes of the story. Ikezawa Kinnouske is the only exception to this, he's literally the worst, way worse than Naoki in my opnion, everyone else is cool.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime, many of the more notable moments are so well done and satisfying, which is important as those moments are what you are looking for in your romance anime. The end is incredibly fulfilling as it goes all the way with its romantic story leaving an incredibly satisfying ending that is close to unheard of in most romance anime that more anime should really do.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nWatch if you want to see...\\n\r\n-A romantic story that actually goes past marriage\\n\r\n-Incredibly satisfying romantic story\\n\r\n-Incredibly well done flags (milestones in the relationship)\\n\r\n-Satisfying character developments with the leads\\n\r\n-A ton of genuinely intimate moments between leads\\n\\n",

            "content": "I loved Itazura na Kiss more than I loved my entire existence. It was my life. The lead characters got together, they got married, they had a kid, it was awesome. I thought it was way better than the anime in which the characters take the whole season to realize their feelings and act on them, and there may or may not be a kiss at the end. I liked it, it was nice, it was good. The guy was good for eventually liking the girl, and the girl was a hero for getting the guy. \r\nHahahahahah...The past is a scary, scary place. Where doI even start?\\n\\n\r\nStory: A girl's house breaks down and she and her father move into the house of her father's friend, and the son of that friend just happens to be the girl's crush, who does not like her back, and he makes this fact very clear to her. The two are on two polar opposites of the academic spectrum, with the guy being the smartest one in their school, and the girl is among one of the dumbest. The girl lives her life with this boy in her mind and does anything to please him. The anime shows their life starting from the end of high school, and goes well into their adult life. What I don't like about this plot is the plot. It's a romance anime, so it should be about romance, but I just do not like the romance. Yes, the love is unrequited at first, but later on, the two leads are mutually in love, so it should seem so. The whole time, I just felt like I was watching how a girl with low self-esteem handles herself in an abusive relationship.\\n\r\n2/10....shame \\n\\n\r\nArt: I liked the character designs, Kotoko is cute, everybody looks different, but they failed to show what makes Mr. Genius so handsome to everybody. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder but considering how every girl in the anime is willing to kill herself for some Irie, he is not that much of a catch. Since not much was invested in developing the main guy's non-existent personality, they could have made him a bit more charismatic. \\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: I like the opening and both endings, I also love Kotoko's seiyuu, I am a fan of her music and I think she is a perfect fit. We could have gone without the \"Irie-kun!!!!~\" though.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Easily the worst part of this anime. The only reason I didn't give this a 1 out of 10 is because I like the mom. \\n\r\nKotoko is dumb. Everyone in the anime knows she's dumb, but they seem to be confused as to the reason why she is. They think it's because of her grades; that is why they think Irie, who is stupid too, is a genius, because of his class rank. What. a. load. of. bull. Kotoko has no self-esteem. I do feel bad for her, but at the same time, she is not real. The creator of this anime tried to make her love story seem like a beautiful thing, like winning the heart of a guy who everyone thinks is too good for her is an awesome thing, like pleasing him so he thinks better of her is great for her. How awful. She's no angel though. While Irie only likes her because she feeds his ego, Kotoko only likes Irie for his looks and popularity. There is literally no other reason. They don't have heart-to-heart talks about their feelings, they don't laugh togther or acknowledge mutual issues. The whole anime was just Kotoko embarrassing herself. Irie is an example of that one bad ex many girls have who is supposed to help the girl realise their worth, work on themselves, and find someone else who respects them. Irie is portrayed as a smart guy who is bored with life, and is not very ambitious, because he is so good at everything. Maybe he is insecure deep-down, but the anime never touched on that. They could have done more with his personality so we can understand the roots of his douchebaggery and make him into a more like-able character. Maybe Kotoko brings out his ambition, or maybe she makes him a better person, but the anime made it seem like she was just a source of entertainement to make his life less boring. Irie could have been a great character. He could have been nicer to Kotoko, and Kotoko could have grown a backbone but no.\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: At first, I enjoyed this anime because I thought it was good, then I enjoyed it because of how bad it was, now I just can't enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't know, this just...is not a very good anime lol XD",

At first when I read the description of this anime I thought that it would be one of those boring shujo animes but in reality it turned out to be an anime where I could watch episode after episode and the time would just fly.\r\nNot only is this anime funny it takes the extra step to set itslef aside from regular shujo animes by going over a huge chunk of the character's life. \r\nStory : I really loved the fact that they went over a huge chunk of the characters lives becauseit made me feel as if the characters really did change alot. At times I thought that this anime is really unfair to the supporting cast and why did Kotoko always love Irie-kun when he was such a meanie towards her. In the end everything worked out and I was really satisfied with the ending. \\n\\n\r\nArt : The art is really good considering the time it was in. I do think that they could have made Irie-kun a little bit hotter.\\n\\n\r\nSound : The sounds were okay and the ending song after episode 15 (I think after episode 15) was good to listen too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : There is lots of character development in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : I enjoyed this anime soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much. It is really entertaining and funny to watch. 1001 % for enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nWell my review obviously lacked in many areas but the only thing I am here to do is reccomend this anime to anyone and everyone. It is really good and deserves at LEAST one chance.",

Goes the whole spectrum from shoujo into josei and into a new genre of anime probably to be identified by future generations as \"obaa-san\". Kinda random over timewarps, too. Ooh, and MonF bitchslaps are hella romantic - that's how every single romance really gets serious here. And there are A LOT.\r\nArt (9 chars/ 4 everything else): Character models great, but then somebody obviously ran out of cash. Well, either that or the Korean/Vietnamese places that generally take care of CGI, backgrounds, and juicy colours went onstrike or something. EXPECT WELL-ANIMATED CHARACTERS - some very expressive, some just really cool solutions, and some like the Osakans or the foreigners just impossibly hilarious to look upon... BUT ALL THAT ON BLAND GREY BACKGROUNDS. LIKE THE WORST, EVER. A LOT. (you get used to it)\\n\\n\r\nSound (6): ED2 or whichever was Go!Go!7188's \"Kataomoi Fighter\" was awesome. Other OP/EDs were bland. Some interesting use of song and sound in-episode for tension and mood, though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6): I don't think you're SUPPOSED to like the characters. I was somewhat bothered by my impressions of the lot of them, but after the second half gave even the butt-ugly lower-class Kansai kid with a heart of gold his five minutes of asshattery, I decided to relax any and all attachments to the characters - and started enjoying the series. Everyone's here for the lulz. \\n\\n\r\nBtw, if you think the antifeminist position is bad, check out the intra-Japan \"racism\" (Kansai/Osakans and especially the country bumpkins are both drawn and treated as above and beyond fugly). Only a baka-gaijin character ever takes poor Kin-chan seriously, and he spends the second half of the series slooooooooowly processing the fact that no, she's for real and not just out to screw with his mind. The rest of the cast are properly horrified.\\n\\n\r\nOh well, it was still fun.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9): Strange, huh? Maybe it appeals to our inner maso side. Watched all 25 eps in one sitting. Yes, even ep 25, which seemed to exist just to make fun of the village people and remind everyone that there IS in fact something worse than being from Osaka.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7): The more I thought about it, the more this dropped. I started out wanting to give it a 9 or 10, then compared it to the level of real 9 and 10s - ...nope!",

            "content": "When I saw this show being recommended after watching Lovely Complex, I had high expectations for it. I loved that show, so why not try something like it? I have a open mind for anime, I watch at least 5 episodes until I declare it unwatchable.  This is one of the few times I actually wanted to enjoy it, but ended up not doing that at all. \r\nI loved the main character girl, Kotoko. She was nice and overall the normal girl. But what I truly hated was Irie. While sure later in the story, its obvious they'll be together, the attitude of thatmeany makes me think that they will never be. He's mean and makes me want to punch him. What's even sadder is that she still likes him even if he treats her like crap. After a few episodes, I got tired of him and his pathetic attitude and gave up the series all together. Sure in Lovely Complex there were times that it was like this, but it wasn't in the very beginning and it didn't go on for like forever. So sadly, this is one of the anime that will get a low rating from me.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, enough ranting of story. :3 Let's keep going!\\n\\n\r\nArt was nice. Well drawn. Loved the emotions showed in characters and in background.\\n\\n\r\nSound was nice also. Typical music in the background during show and opening and ending songs were good also.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, I think I said it well in the intro but the rest of the characters were okay. I liked how they were, except the little brother and irie.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment was okay, but like I said the complete mean attitude of Irie really brought down the enjoyment.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall? If they made it that Kotoko and irie be friend-ish (like in Lovely Complex) in the beginning and started the trouble in the middle, like Lovely Complex. It would've gotten me hooked, but sadly it didn't. So, I say a 3 out of 10. \\n\\n\r\nRatings:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 1\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound:8\\n\r\nCharacter:3\\n\r\nEnjoyment:3\\n\r\nOverall:3\\n\\n\r\nEdit: 12/30/10\\n\\n\r\nI know I said bad things about this anime. I had some people that had read my review and tried to convince me otherwise. I decided to re-watch it and I did like it. It was a good anime, I enjoyed the ups and downs of the relationship and the character development in the anime. Also what I liked is how no matter how Kotoko is, Irie loves her for who she is. That's how a relationship is and how it should go. So my new rating is:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound:7\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8",

            "content": "Story 6: Reason? There isn't really a plot, no grand moment where the two are sprung together (save for the minute detail of being bunged into the same house of the love infatuation that could have been played better), any problems or potential long running back-stories are only really superficial and are soon resolved by the protagonist's bizarre dedication to the man of her dreams. Throughout the first few episodes I was thinking there could be some progression in terms of plots and I admit to enjoying how the stories of the first few sessions turned out but these soon faded with the second partof the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8: The landscapes and scenery might be average to some but I quite liked the way in that they were drawn and animated. With most shoujo's expect over the top flower petals, shimmering bubbles of light and hazy fuzy lighting effects when a daydream or something vaguely romantic occurs. This happens a fair amount in this anime, more than any other I've seen since our main protagonist appears to have flashbacks/fantasy daydreams every other five minutes. I found it sweet but potentially unnerving in places that they consisted nothing but the love interest. \\n\\n\r\nSound 7: Didn't really find much wrong with it. The opening sequences could have been done in a better way, sound effects were average but nothing stood out to be as needing to be changed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 4: This has to be the harshest rating I've given an anime in the history of ... well history. Why you ask? Shoujo in general does not submit altogether excellent, well rounded characters in the first place but each member of other mangas I have read have left me either empathetic towards a character in a bad situation or respectful of how their life and personality unfolds. Sadly here there is no development with the main female role, whom exists soully to grow up and be devoted to the one she loves. Cute right? I would have thought so if the writers just gave her a few details else that made her unique and original next to the love interest but everything she has done, or is about to do is for someone else. Despite being fairly headstrong in some places it really surprises me she completely has no life plan at all other than to devote her living and job to her partner. This irked me greatly as this is an extremely old fashioned way of presenting females with no self will or self motivation to go 'their own way' without male influence. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the love interest, it's hard to really understand exactly how Kotoko fell for Naoki in the first place; sure with most jerks we secretly reveal he's got a heart of gold or has redeeming features to the viewers. In this particular anime he gets away with constantly putting Kotoko down in public, in front of family and friends and honestly couldn't find an ounce in respect he has towards her. Most of the time my brain was begging the writers to do just something that made him likeable to the common non-infatuated woman who cares not just for material value such as good lucks or good grades.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6: If putting key flaws aside is easy for you and you're just in the mood for some quiet and simple shoujo anime then this could easily score higher than a 6 for you but I found as the series progressed I was getting more and more weighed down by how little change there was in the progression of character, story and general feel for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall averaging @ 5.8; rating of 6. Decent but not really up the street of someone who wishes to see rounded, interesting characters, a decently explainable plot line and free thinking independent women. Sadly I fell into all three.",

I finally went around to cleaning out my \"plan to watch\" and this went.\r\nThen I saw a small clip from it somewhere on the web. I decided to give it a one episode chance. It was hilarious, and the characters were instantly well developed.\r\nMy favorite part of the anime was Kotoko's persistance, and Irie's consistently cold nature, I loved how sarcastic he could be and how mean he was. It was absolutely funny through out.\r\nThe intro and ending songswere okay, but I didn't particularly enjoy or dislike them. The rest of the music was alright.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters were very well defined immediately. The story has many arcs that are thoroughly played out and absolutely enjoyable. I don't want to spoil anything major but I will say the anime is wonderful for a huge reason - it goes past the point most anime end and continues into the future.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a great, yet overlooked anime. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend it to everyone looking for a good laugh, some feels here and there, and an anime that'll make you want to just want to watch the next episode.\\n\\n",

The story continues on and you get to watch as Irie becomes less of a douche I guess and how most of the characters get their own story? I don't know but the thing I love about this anime is that it feels like a real relationship that could happen anywhere due to it not being so I'm always going to love you which I know sounds bad but if you think about it when have you EVER seen a couple not fight I mean once I saw a couple have a FIGHT FOR NEVER FIGHTING as ironic as that is. I feel that the character development throughout the plot touched me like never before (pls for the love of god don't turn that into a sick joke). I also enjoyed the fact that it wasn't some weird I'm an alien even though the story would work even if I was a normal girl/boy. The only problems that I had with this anime if you would consider this bad is first Kotoko's friends in high school made me rage and \\n\r\nSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER\\n\r\nDO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS 75% OF THE WAY THROUGH\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe doctor nurse cliche at the end pissed me the FUCK off omg just make them a married couple FFS \\n\\n\r\nsigh... \\n\\n\r\nTy for reading and I would really like to know how to improve so leave a comment and tell me if this was helpful pls!",

It has a very unique story and not only does it have good high school life romance it also goes beyond high school romance onwards to getting jobs as adults and marriage. I also loved the main characters Kotoko and Irie because of their personalities and on how what one lacks the other has. I love seeing every episode the progression between the two and the obstacles they have to overcome. The art style isn't bad either. By far this anime has to be my favourite romance and far outranks any of the modern romances in my opinion.",

Instead of giving us a stressful and tedious \"almost romantic\" couple, Itazura Kiss shows a growing romance that progresses all the way though that annoying teenage crush phase into Marriage and beyond. But, even with this rare romantic progression, this show quickly becomes one of the most annoying descents into hell that one will ever encounter. \r\nThe story progression is really the only saving grace for this show's disastrous main character, Kotoko Aihara. Her antics that were cute in the beginning became less so as she grows older and goesout into the world. There is no way that anyone with her behavior would be successful in any way let alone in any romantic relationship. The show tries to explain how Kotoko is desirable throughout the different arcs and conflicts but they fail to show any true value in her actions. \\n\r\nIf this story had taken itself a little more seriously then this could possible have become a great show. But, as it is now, Itazura Kiss is no more than a mediocre attempt at showing the great trials and triumphs of love.",

I will say that theres not a whole hell of alot thats new or original about this but it does a fairly good job with what its got so we have to credit it that much.\r\nStory: girl likes boy, boy does most epic rejection ever, girls house collapses, girl ends up living with boy... huh, thats not usually how it works, but what the hell right? its anime, whos going to question it. Basically from here on out it is theirinteractions and the building of feelings and the other stuff that usually happens in this type of show. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Cant complain, so long as it doesnt look like it was drawn by an infant i'm usually okay.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: kotoko is just that girl who doesnt know how to give up on irie who shes in love with, she is also kinda slow and fails at most things she does. Irie on the other hand is disinterested in seemingly everything, is a genius and  good at everything. Right off the bat it doesnt seem like they would be a good pair. the rest of the characters are made up of various guys and gals that are interested in these two characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: well, l did enjoy it at first but every romance in this series was completely one-sided and that actually annoyed me a little bit because that usually doesnt work out, but somehow or other, they all seem to here. \\n\r\nMy main issue though is that Irie isnt really that great seeming to me. Sure hes good looking, got a cool haircut, knows how to fill out a pair of slacks, but he's still an asshole 90% of the time, and it confuses me what kotoko would see in him. Hell she has way better guys (seriously extremely better) who want to be with her but nope, nice guys gonna lose out here. \\n\r\nSure kotoko loved Irie but the show didnt give me enough reason to and thats why im not really feeling their relationship(not against it, I just think there were more suitable matches). Now, its not like i have a problem with his lack of visible emotion, but damn dude, give me something! I get it, all my life i'd been cold as shit to others, but not to those I care about and thats what I dont quite get from his character. I would sat that it is the fact that emotionally I am so much like irie's character that i cant understand why he doesn't change, but ill quit now before this becomes my personal story.",

I'm also not one who enjoys shoujo that much, but this series has always stuck with me. Sure sometimes the art isn't so great, or the characters aren't quite developed, but I still love this anime, from the bottom of my heart. \r\nIt's your typical shoujo, where Kotoko falls in love with Naoki, someone who's far out of herleague. Though through her perseverance, she gets what she wants, which no one should deny her of. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, it's cute and funny at times, and even brings me to tears every time I watch it. I'm still saddened by the death of the author of the manga this anime was adapted from. The reason I gave it a 10 is obvious, because I love it. However, I always wished there was a second season, because the ending just wasn't enough (plus there were plans for this series to get another season, but the author died, so that never happened).\\n\\n\r\nThis was a scatterbrained review, but I just tried putting into words what I get from this series whenever I re-watch it.",

The characters didn't progress too much - especially the hero and heroine... It seemed that those around them progressed in life, but their characters barely changed by the end. The hero was a complete jerk to the heroine all the way until the last episode. The last two episodes were really the only times I felt him changing into someone a little better. Why did the heroine stick to him?? Why did she put up with his hurtful abuse?? Even after marriage, he NEVERpaid attention to her unless something extreme was going on (like affair or birth - which are huge!)\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing, is that I can understand why the hero's mother wanted her son to marry the heroine so badly (she was the main comic relief that there can be some hope for the hero if this is his mother), but what I can never understand is why the heroine's father allowed there to be a marriage at all! And, duh! He could see how abusive and rude the boy was that his daughter was in love with - why didn't he do anything about it?? Marry for love, even if it hurts you! Go for it, daughter! I support your wretched husband. \\n\\n\r\nI personally was almost rooting for a divorce... Why did they even get married in the first place? The relationship went from man who hates girl, to man declaring he wants to marry girl - the very next day! Then, no time for dating to help him grow up and learn to appreciate the heroine before she becomes his... they were married in two weeks and he was a total butthead during the wedding and honey moon... on and on and on. \\n\\n\r\nI can drag on forever...

            "content": "Let me start by saying that Itazura na Kiss is one of the most complete romance anime i have ever watched. This doesn't necessarily mean its better than Clannad or Sakarasou no Pet na Kanojo for example, but its still up there in the top romance anime the way i see it.\r\nStory 9/10: Similarly to Clannad, what makes this anime so good is the character development and the progression for that stage where the characters barely know each other to a point where they cant be without each other. This anime includes all of the steps to a good relationship with someone. Unlike most animethis isn't one of those main character chases someone who is way out of their league, they kiss at the end and that's it, its completely different. Like a lot of romance anime the main character tries very hard to get with the person of his/he dreams and it proves pointless for a while. But after a lot of hard work and even some tears, they end up achieving what they desired most. And what i truly loved about this anime was that it could have ended in 13 episode, but it went further on in the story of the lovers and showed how they lived their lives even after high school.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound 9/10: This anime came out in 2008 but there were no noticeable problems with its quality. I don't generally like those anime where i feel like the producers were lazy (Bokura ga Ita) and the characters looked very simple and maybe even unappealing. This anime was perfect in the art area. I felt a lot of effort in the producing of this show. The sounds were perfect, i didn't feel like a lot was missing in this regard. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: In the beginning i was hesitant to watch this anime because I don't like anime where i feel that the main male character is always cold or a just plain wimp, but this anime surprised me. In the beginning, I hated Irie but as the anime progressed and his feelings grew I began to fully understand why most anime have to start with the characters not liking each other. This is important to the story and it highlights how vital character development is to a love story. The supporting characters could of done a better job however.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: I enjoyed this anime a lot. It wasn't one of those anime where it was okay but i really wanted it to end(Bokura ga Ita). It moved at a pretty comfortable pace and I wasn't at all disappointed at how it went. Honestly I have very little to complain about this anime, it was almost perfect in every regard to a romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: Again barely anything was bad about this anime. Moved at a good pace, very well made characters(for the most part)and I loved how the romance went throughout the anime. When it ended I still wanted to see more regardless of the fact that it was complete for a romance anime. And i mean COMPLETE. I don't know many anime besides Clannad that were this complete. It did good in every aspect and if the supporting characters had a little more of a presence I would definitely give this anime a 10/10.",

It's 2015 already. Since it's old, I think new generations wouldn't stand it a chance to give it a shot.\r\n2. The story sometimes goes circle: Aihara hopes, Irie lets her down, but then he does something good for her, like kissing for example, then Aihara's happy, and loves Irie even more @@\r\n3. Special scenes:\r\n- ep 13: Irie's secret kiss to Aihara: I kind of love it. He's cold outside, warm inside. But that outside thing annoys me, his faceis always in a fine condition, it seems like there's no ability to change it. And I don't like that, he doesn't do much for the girl, instead he depresses her so often. \\n\r\n- I don't remember which episode but after graduation or something, Irie challenged Aihara if she could forget him, then kiss her. He shows his love but still, it's rude somehow, I don't like how he acts already (but Aihara... why you like him? just after seeing him doing his speech?). I wanted to quit. But I want to see (if) him change.\\n\r\nep 14: kiss before wedding & Aihara's active kiss in wedding: no chemistry... because of the man.\\n\r\nep 15: kiss and bed scene: I don't like it.\\n\r\nep 18: the girl should go to that guy already: I can't stand Irie so when there appears another good man, I hope she chooses him but no, she doesn't. I feel so bad for her.\\n\r\nep 19: nice proposal from kin-chan.\\n\r\nI find myself kind of delighted when there aren't those two, but other characters.\\n\r\nOverall, my face while watching the show was similar to Irie-kun's, how nice...\\n\r\nMaybe I'm still a teenager, it's not fit for me, it seems so forced, their love... \\n\r\nIt has a good ending anyway, characters grown up, happy family.\\n\r\nI'm sorry for bad expression.\\n\r\nToday is the last day of my two-week Tet (T\u1ebft) Holiday, I'll no longer have time for anime T_T so sad...",

            "content": "Plot: 7/10 \r\nSummary: This anime begins with our main character Kotoko Aihara who is a third year high school student. She's in class F which is known as the \"stupid class\" in the school. She has fallen in love with fellow senior Naoki Irie who is the smartest, most popular and most sought after guy in school. He is in the elite class A. In an embarrassing turn of events Kotoko gives Naoki a letter confessing her long term feelings for him which he immediately rejects. When she returns to her newly built home later that night, an earthquake strikes causing her entire home tofall apart. This leaves Kotoko and her father with nowhere to go. Last minute, out of the kindness of their heart, Mr. Aihara's old high school friend offers to let the two of them stay in their house until the Aihara home can be repaired. Who is Mr. Aihara's high school friend? None other than Naoki's father. Now Kotoko has to live with the embarrassment of her recent confession while living under the same roof as Naoki. \\n\\n\r\nI give the plot on this one a 7/10 because it is just so typical! There are so many shoujo animes that are about the dumb, ditzy girl falling for the smart, popular, perfect guy that everyone likes. The one thing that redeems it is that it takes a turn that's different than most animes of its kind. Itazura Na Kiss takes Kotoko's story through not only high school, but college and adulthood. It spans over a solid 15 year time period which is really nice to see. The high school portion of this anime actually only lasts through the first seven episodes. So that difference in pace is why I like this anime over others.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime really annoy me to be honest. Kotoko's ditzyness really wares on your nerves after awhile. Actually it doesn't even take that long to tire of her. Yet, as the story progresses they do an excellent job of progressing her character. She never completely changes but gets a lot better. Naoki has his own set of problems. He's just rude. There's really no other way to describe it other than that. You watch the entire show hoping he's going to get better, and he does, but not too much. The other side characters also get annoying and random at times. Some of them become unnecessary toward the end. They pop up randomly and you almost forget they existed. That being said, the overall story progresses the characters well. In the end, you get to see what happens to each one of the ones who are actually important parts of the story. It leaves no loose ends which is something a lot of other animes do.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: I really can't give music a proper score on here because it doesn't really exist in this anime. I mean, yes they have background music in it but it's nothing I can really pinpoint as being bad or good. It's just... there.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 6/10\\n\r\nThe animation in this isn't bad by any definition of the word. It's decent enough. There's just nothing about it that makes it more than average. It's just basic, fairly fluid and has decent use of colors. At times I did find it almost to have a blurry unfocused quality about it. So I found it just, meh.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nYou may be wondering, why did you give this anime such a high overall score when you didn't give any of the sub categories a super high score? If I was making this review after I watched it the first time I would have given it a 5 or 6/10. But I actually rewatched it and enjoyed it a lot more the second time. I feel like with this anime, the more you put into it, the more you get out of it. To properly enjoy it you have to really read between the lines and think about why the characters are the way they are. I noticed a lot more about Naoki especially the second time around. There is a decent amount of comedy to balance out the drama as well. So to me the negative aspects that I mentioned above are mostly outweighed by the things I enjoyed. If you watch it once and like it, definitely try watching it again after a couple of months or so and you might like it even more.",

Usually it's about a girl who falls in love with her prince and we get to know their story - how they get along/how their relationship works. When I started to watch Itazura na Kiss, I wouldn't imagine that it will be so entertaining and amazing!\r\nThe story is told from Kotoko's view. We can hear her thoughts and opinions. We get to know her life, her goals and dreams, her feelings. The story is well-told, it has a decent ending, but for me it would be more fun if I could hear Naoki's thoughts sometimes.\r\nItis simple but great. I was never bored or waited for an episode's end. And how entertaining is it? There are some live action adaptations too, and they are all popular.\\n\\n\r\nBoth main and supporting characters are loveable. They are well-rounded and change as the story goes on.\\n\\n\r\nOnce you start to watch it, you just can't get enough of it. I re-watched it a few times and it's still fun and adorable.

            "content": "A pretty standard shoujo series, but has wonderful character development.\r\nPLOT: Typical shoujo girl falls in love with boy, but he\u2019s an aloof prick type show \u2013 but what makes Itazura different is that it follows this couple for 10 years! We get to see Kotoko & Naoki\u2019s life from high school to parenthood and it\u2019s a very enjoyable ride. The middle section dealing with University is a bit slow and seems to be trying too hard to be interesting, but the high school and post uni arc\u2019s are good. Itazura has some brilliant characters and an excellent supporting cast \u2013 I think my favourite hasto be Naoki\u2019s fangirl mother, some of the best comedy is provided by her. Kotoko is an idiot who doesn\u2019t know when to quit, but a likeable idiot nonetheless. I had difficulty liking Naoki though, he can be an utter bastard at times and his little brother is irritating as well. Overall the strong point of Itazura is its character development. By following the same people over 10 years it gives plenty of time to let the characters mature and its this point that made this shoujo romcom stand above the competition for me.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: Oh dear \u2013 the animation is in a word, ugly. Terrible character designs \u2013 Kotoko never ages, Naoki is meant to be gorgeous but isn\u2019t bishie at all and everyone is shapeless. The budget on this show is obviously minimal as backgrounds are plain and everything lacks detail. Colours used are also dull and washed out looking, animation quality is not the best here.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & VOICE ACTING: Did not like the OP much, and the EDs were OK for the genre. Didn\u2019t notice the BGM much so it was neither good nor bad. Voice acting is great though. Since the characters are what made this show worthwhile for me all the seiyuu did wonderful jobs bringing their characters to life.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all a shoujo romcom that while it suffers from bad animation and a flabby middle section, is a very good watch with great fun characters and lots of development.",

            "content": "Itazura na Kiss. What can i say about this anime. \r\nJUST WATCH IT. i simply cannot recommend this enough. it honestly doesn't matter if you're a fan of the shoujo genre or not, this is a wonderful, wonderful, uplifiting, hilarious, heartwarming series for all.\r\nmy main qualm with the typical shoujo romance storyline is the incredibly unrealistic amount of opposition/ interferences the two main protagonists usually have to battle against (again in a completely unrealistic way) in order to be together. in my opinion this just ruins the story, even if i find it truly engaging at the beginning. this is also what somehow ruined HanaYori Dango for me. but in all honestly itazura na kiss does NOT fall into this incredibly annoying formula. sure, there are the occasional obstacles to overcome but they're all resolved in a believable way and they're not dragged out for so long you start pulling your hair out in infuriation. \\n\\n\r\nyes, the initial plot falls into the typical shoujo formula, but it's what the mangaka DOES with the forumla that is so refreshing and engaging. you really do feel so invested in the characters and you form a real emotional attachment and engagement with them that is hard to find in anime usually. sure, there is some one-dimensional quality to some of them at first but even the supporting characters develop and grow as the anime progresses. \\n\\n\r\nwhat underpins the anime as a whole, and the reason why it is so endearingly wonderful is the relationship between the main characters. they really do grow and develop as people throughout the series and the trials and tribulations they encounter are mostly very relateable and real. of course, the absolute hilarious situations and unique characters all add to the enjoyment of the series, but it's the relationship of the main characters that really carry it through and (for me anyway) elevates it above the poloi of shoujo animes.\\n\\n\r\nso, what i'm really trying to say is that just because the series initially falls into the typical shoujo setup shouldn't deter you from at least trying it out, because what's done WITH that shoujo formula is what makes it a truly remarkable, touching series that will stay with me for a long time to come.",

And he stays a jerk for the first 13 or so episodes (although you see moments where he's softening from time to time.) I also have a problem with less-than-intelligent female leads (as shoujo seems to be chock-full of stupid heroines). \r\nSo why did I rate this series so highly? Because it was absolutely DARLING. The characters draw you in (despite the jerk) and they evolve, and mature, and you see their relationship progress even after they have thatfirst kiss. By the time I reached the end of the series, I loved both of them and Irie wasn't a jerk anymore. In fact, he turned into a pretty good man. And Kotoko, the girl, became much more capable and cool as well. \\n\\n\r\nSo should you watch this series? Absolutely. Just stick with it through the first 13 episodes until Irie buys a clue, okay?",

            "content": "Itazura Na Kiss. Playful Story that challenges the shoujo standard?\r\n        Itazura Na Kiss is a comedy, romance, shoujo, that is PG-13.\r\n     The story starts off like a typical shoujo. The female lead Kotoko is a baka, caring girl who is in love with the smart, handsome, male lead Irie. Then in a scenario that can only be made possible in a shoujo her house is destroyed by an earthquake and her and her father stay with her father'sfriend, which happens to be Irie's father. If you seen shoujo you know how it will end, the two will end up together despite the obstacles that stand before them. Yet unlike any shoujo I have ever seen it doesn't end with the two happy ending, the story continues and you watch them grow afterwards. It was a shock because the story throw in the element of slice of life in the beginning, yet unlike shoujo that just becomes outrageously unrealistic it kept that element. Before you know it you are watching episodes back to back in anticipation of what will happen in their lives because it's not just about their love, but about their life.\\n\\n\\n\r\n       The art will throw you off. It's not bad, but the characters are different. With most male leads in shoujo they look drop dead gorgeous, but this male lead looks average giving you this realist flare. Most guys that are handsome aren't really handsome, but they have that charm around them. Also the female lead is average as well. The settings are plain and simple which fits the mood of this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\n      I didn't pay attention to the theme music, I mean for crying out loud I watched this in a day and I have a headache, but I am happy for it. However the voice actors did a splendid job. Sorry to my dub fans, but this anime is purely sub. Still do not let the fact that this anime is only in subs stop you from missing out on it. \\n\\n\\n\r\n   The characters were cliche and typical. This is a shoujo we are talking about so it is not strange. However they still manage to grow on you and I bet some would wonder why. Well just because something is cliche doesn't mean it will not have an impact. There is almost always something unique in characters even the cliched ones and in this anime it is not hard to find. Kotoko comes off as a stupid, naive chick, but her determination makes you cheer her on because we all have our stupid moments, yet we drive further.\\n\\n\\n\r\n     I definitively enjoyed this anime and I would recommend it to a person who is tired of the same shoujo stuff and want something different even if it's just a little. I do not know though about recommending you watch the live dramas because I have not watched them and I am still considering whether I should or shouldn't.  There are three, Korean version, Japanese verison, and Taiwanese version. If you enjoy the anime and would like to check them out then go ahead.\\n",

It tried to deliver a good message (Love triumph over all) but the messenger who was carrying the message fell into a river which made the message muddy and then was attacked by rabid dogs and survived only to finally get mauled by a lion:D my point is that they didn't deliver the message properly\\n\r\nThose 5 final episodes were a good attempt for damage control but still too late after all that damage\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6.5/10)\\n",

            "content": "WARNING- Lite spoiler are included, nothing big or important but be warned!\r\n\"Kotoko is incapable of doing 90% of the things i can do.\r\nBut as for the 10% i can't do, she succeeds where no one else could.\"\r\nItazura no Kiss (Playful Kiss or Mischievous Kiss) is a masterpiece of japanese manga literature written way back in 1991 by late Kaoru Tada. The manga never got finished because of the authors death. Nevertheless it became something of a must read for all romantic enthusiasts.  \r\nKnowing all of that i just didn't want to watch something that would ruin experience that i got from reading the manga,but as i just found myself giving up on one anime after the other i had to reach for the BLACK BOOK. And first in there was Itazura no Kiss.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnime starts of with the main character Kotoko giving a love letter to Ilie-kun, and his blunt, brutal and overwhelming rejection. But as anime faith would have it thru some strange work of forces of nature they end up living together at Irie's place, and Kotoko's everyday battle to win Naoki Irie over begins.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly the story- Itazura no Kiss has a story that will never leave you stranded and thinking \"Ooo god how much more of this will i have to watch?!\". The story constantly, steadily and slowly progresses, thru the 25 episodes characters grow and develop, change, mature and never leave room for a dull moment. This is gonna be a bit of a spoiler, but for some ten years that we follow Kotoko and Irie you see them both mature and help each other develop into a better person. It's one of the best romance animes i ever watched, maybe the BEST!\\n\\n\r\nSparkly and shiney art- Art isn't anything new or revolutionary, it fits the mood perfectly, the nice and colorful background for the happy moments and the darker and closed scenes for the sadder. The only thing that i didn't really like in this anime is Kotoko's sometimes HUGE eyes, but that was the fab back in 2008 so i didn't mind it to much.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound- First i just wanna say that this anime has a AWESOME OST! The opening Kimi, Meguru, Boku and the endings Kataomoi Fighter(watch the video on YT) and Jikan yo Tomare fell like tailor made for this show, they help enhance the beginning and the end of the episodes and just sound overall great! \\n\r\nThe voice actors just add another dimension to the show Nana Mizuki(WWWorking, Darker then Black...) dose a superb joob of relaying Kotoko's emotions to the viewer, and Daisuke Hirakawa (Free, Fukka and Belzebub) adds a calm, secure but also a loving fell to Irie. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters- Well if i had to say what makes this show great it would be easy, Kotoko and Irie! The characters are perfectly done for a 25 episode show, you see them develop, struggle, change, learn... you see them go thru life and whit that they make you fell happy, sad, even mange to bring a tear to the eye. Irie dose seem a bit cold and harsh at first but later you see his true feelings for Kotoko. \\n\r\nThe support characters are also well done, from the crazy mom who will make you laugh, Kinuske who is a all in all a great guy, Yuuki the young brother that helps at the moment when nobody would expect it and Miki a failure as a trap but a great friend. \\n\r\nEverybody here develops and changes a bit throughout the show, and it just leaves a great impression of them all growing up and maturing together.\\n\\n\r\nWas it good, the Enjoyment- If i wanted to compare the feeling that i had after finishing Itazura no Kiss with another show... well that would be hard. \\n\r\nItazura no Kiss for me raises the bar for romance anime pretty darn high. I generally loved the whole show and everything about it, it fits and it works together to make something amazing that dose not just ride on the name of the manga that it was made upon, but adds a new breath of air to ir.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, overall- All in all i knew by what i read before that Itazura no Kiss isn't just another \"brick in the wall\" of romance animes, but after watching it, it feels like it''s the damn roof! The one or two things that i didn't like really can't even compare to all the things that i love about this show, it maybe a slow pace but at that pace it still manages to deliver. At one scene i just thought that if something bad was to happen i'm gonna cry(a 25 year old, yeah). It might not be a true emotional rollercoaster that we been feed for years, but it dose keep your eyes on the screen and wondering what's gonna happen next from the beginning to the end.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not like any other show, and it's great. That's how i would recommend it. It leaves the viewer feeling of complete and happy story and in my mind i think that even the late Kaoru Tada would appreciate this adaptation.  \\n\\n\r\nP.S. This anime started airing on my BD, so YAY!",

I love how she finds who she is even if it's all because of a guy. \r\nHonestly, the art is a little lacking but it's not bad. The characters and the story plot more than makeup for it. \r\nIf you like the main male character to be indifferent this is your anime. If you like a determined girlseeking love this is your anime.

I was like eh just another romance anime nothing more. BUT LET ME TELL YOU I WAS WRONG, I'M SORRY I MISJUDGE YOU GREAT ANIME UNIVERSE PLEASE FORGIVE ME. \r\nanyways..... back to the reason why I'm writing this, I recommend this anime to anyone you has seen Clannad, I loved all the characters, they all had their own well plotted out personality. I loved Naoki's mother the best for I think I would be a little like her. I would be acrazy when it would come to my kids' personal lives. I liked how the series took over the course of 10+ years (sorry if I got that wrong I'm just making my best estimate). And if anyone else gets frustrated about the love interests not getting together until THE VERY LAST EPISODE. Then this is the anime for you, they get together, in the middle of series. Overall, it's a great anime for anyone who likes the following\\n\\n\r\ncontains:\\n\\n\r\nhigh school/college love story\\n\r\nthe love interest actually together\\n\r\na crazy mother who stalks the otp \\n\\n\r\nthen this is the anime for you\\n\\n\r\nuntil next time I'm out. \\n\\n",

I personally enjoyed this because i liked the characters and how they are and how they were NOTgeneric  this anime brought alot to the table so thats why i enjoyed it.

            "content": "It's a will they or won't they, just that one is a utter cold genius, the other is a lovable ditz.\r\nItazura na Kiss follows Kotoko Aihara a ditzy girl who proclaimed her love to Naoki Irie, a genius student in his school through a love letter, through unforeseen circumstances that includes Kotoko's house being razed and Kotoko's father acquaintance, Kotoko has to live in the same roof as Naoki. Will Kotoko and Naoki, two diametric opposite personalities ever come into terms with one another even with those circumstances?...this is Itazura na Kiss. \r\nOne of the biggest strengths LA actually had for Itazura na Kiss alsobrings up is the \"hierarchy\" of \"just being smart\" isn't all you need, if you don't have some god damn compassion to go along with your smarts, perfectly manifested in both Kotoko and Naoki, they are both diametric opposites to this, but together they not only help each other, but they help everyone else in the process and sure they \"don't demolish the hierarchy\", but more or less brings up the issue with the manifestation of the main protagonists and that is usually by their highschool arc, however later on it goes into evolve the message as \"divert from the hierarchy of intelligence is everything\" to \"determination\" mostly in the form of Kotoko. Next is that Itazura na Kiss just isn't a \"highschool romance anime\", as it does push settings from highschool to college to even career life with how this kind of relationship \"develops\" even further than the \"will they won't they\" status of the main duo of Naoki and Kotoko and that in itself is actually refreshing. Finally, Itazura na Kiss has ALOT of characters, and for the most part the majority of the characters are decent except for the characters like Yuuko Matsumoto voiced by Yuki Masuda that are just obstacles or \"generic romantic rival love interests\" trying to get in the way of Kotoko and Naoki relationship, however there are even what LA can call \"minor character focused episodes\" that do focus on the ones LA just mentioned before and some newer characters gets this, one surprisingly character being the Motoki Kikyou voiced by Mitsuki Saiga a guy who prefers to be a girl and he gets a very dedicated half-episode about his gender and how society viewed it through traditional eyes and for a 2008 anime, it's a uniquely \"current\" issue even now. But even with these kind of characters and the beta couples that form, they too become likable by the end of it and they too evolve or go through their own obstacles as much as Kotoko does...well to the point that LA was rooting is that if the beta couples and the minor characters have more of a focused and better development than our alpha couple...well that going into more detail in the next paragraph.\\n\\n\r\nLA will say this bluntly as possible, but the biggest and most annoying flaw to Itazura na Kiss is Naoki Irie himself, why?...well it's his personality and his utter resistance to change. Irie's main deal is that he for the majority of the screentime he has, has a cold demeanor to almost everyone cept probably his family but his personality STAYS LIKE THIS THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME, sure he opens up \"at times\" especially in the more genuine dramatic times, but would ANYONE like a person who almost NEVER opens up only when it doesn't go his way?...even when Kotoko and Naoki's relationship progresses from highschool to college to career a la dating to married...he shows no emotion to help UNLESS he has actual competition in the romantic sense or a dramatic plot twist occurs plotwise. This is kinda what happens if your main love interest is and have always will be a deadpan emotionless being, only in URGENT moments for cheap melodrama he reacts, thus it becomes a completely one-sided romance in which the anime itself ACKNOWLEDGES. We ARE suppose to root for Kotoko and Naoki right???. Sure a similar anime LA can think of is Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji has the same love duo with similar personalities especially concerning the main male love interest, but even THAT anime has almost the same problem as Itazura na Kiss has...ONLY WORSE. LA knows that after Episode 19, Naoki FINALLY starts slowly opening up to Kotoko bit by bit, episode by episode but for that development LA will say that \"your 11 episodes too late (Ep.9-20), it took you long enough!!!\". The only other flaw LA sees in Itazura na Kiss are all the \"love interests\" concerning Naoki throughout the anime, many of which DO bring up good points that he should be with people like himself, however the majority of them goes into the \"rival love interest for Kotoko just because\" and inevitably, we know they can't rival Kotoko (through basic romance tropes)...though some do cross the line to the point of trying to break up the two main love duo out of spite or jealousy. As for Kotoko's love interests, well they actually have a semblance concerning the plot and the romance involving Kotoko and Naoki who though one is slightly melodramatic (*cough* Kinnosuke's), question their diametric opposite relationship as whole compared to Naoki's generic love interests sans Christine. Nonetheless it's just another obstacle Kotoko has to go through to be with Naoki and annoyingly so.\\n\\n\r\nLA's favourite characters goes quite easily to Kotoko Aihara voiced by Nana Mizuki as you can actually relate to her and feel her plight from an academically and romantics standpoint, the only other character that came close to her was Naoki Irie's mother Noriko voiced by Naoko Matsui, sure she's a doting parent and utterly ships Naoki with Kotoko, but she's one of brightest spots of hope to the series, as she is the only one actual good advice ad helps Kotoko is some tough spots concerning Naoki, finally on the minor characters, Christine Robbins voiced by Yuuko Gotou was a final great hope spot for likable characters and her romantic goals were admirable even if it's similar to Kinnosuke and Kotoko's earlier plot point but gender reversed. On the other spectrum, LA's most hated character in the series is if you can easily guess it Naoki Irie...he had the most problems with the anime as a whole and just his presences of \"not helping his relationship with Kotoko\" made the romantic aspects of the anime even more annoying...yeah not only is the main crux of the anime's problems Irie but diametrically the opposite in likability as well. LA knows LA is defending Kotoko soo much but that's only because Kotoko goes through soo much from jealous rival love interests, crazy married women to Kotoko's own personal goals and problems of her own to try and match Irie's pedestal and she almost gets NOTHING in return for all she's done. Oddly enough it's nice to see that Itazura na Kiss' HUGE cast doesn't exactly revolve around Kotoko and Naoki (cept family and current friends because being obvious) as many of the characters have cameos way later on after Kotoko and Naoki progresses through life and the minor characters (yes even those stereotypical love interests LA mentioned in the above paragraph) have their own lives, developments and goals of their own, LA can easily put this up as a HUGE strength to Itazura na Kiss that LA missed.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, the voice acting has some decent voice acting for the most part, Nana Mizuki as Kotoko has the typical heroine who's in love trope, but she does veer ALOT into the screaming shrill jealousy vocals that gets VERY annoying, though be it it's playing against the type for Nana Mizuki, but even with her broad vocals, the majority for her is the ditzy but nearly shrill scream queen vocals. There is Engrish in this anime and ohh boy does some of the background vocals have the Engrish being strong in this one, if you want to hear some typically awkward Engrish, Itazura na Kiss has it in the spades (Though Yuuko Gotou as Christine was \"ok\" enough for \"Engrish\" standards). For the most part the majority of seiyuu's do an \"ok\" job overall, but LA's favourite voice actor would go to Naoko Matsui as the doting mother of Naoki Irie, her shipping and eccrenticites all the way through was consistent and enjoyable. In the shrill side of things, some of the female VERY minor characters have these shrill vocals but the cream of the crop of shrillness goes to Jinko Komori voiced by Kinoko Yamada had one of the shrillest voices rivaling Chitose Morinaga voicing Flora Flemm from Asterisk War 2 most recently, LA doesn't have anything against Jinko as a character, she to like Satomi Ishikawa voiced by Risa Hayamizu is a supporting character to Kotoko, but seriously...Kinoko's vocals was annoyingly shrill.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, the animation by TMS Entertainment, for the most part the animation has many of the trademarks of the typical shoujoness from the emoticons to the bishie sparkles. Character designs are pretty colorful though some characters gets the \"looks like her daughter/mother vibe\" at times, though due to the animation they get during the \"comedic scenes\" and the \"Kotoko jabbing moments\" goes pseudo-chibi and add that to the exaggeration is typical in Itazura na Kiss and quite often especially from Noriko Irie and Kotoko. Overall the animation is decent and if LA could say the animation in two words it's \"typical shoujoness\", it's not a bad thing though but LA won't really rave the animation as it's not utterly perfect it's just \"decent\" but that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nHalfway through the anime, once Kotoko is in medical school, well it gets melodramatic. But that's not why LA is pointing this out nor is it the \"bad melodrama you think it is\", once a new love interest for Kotoko..yes Kotoko, arrives by the form of Keita Kamogari voiced by Nobutoshi Canna, he brings up a VERY good point of \"why did you marry him?\" and LA utterly agreed with him, why?...as Naoki is STILL COLD towards her and hardly any help to her and hardly even communicates with Kotoko with HER problems instead whines about his and carries on with his goals only...once again...why do we have to root for these two? and sure by the halfway point many of the minor characters have evolved outside some of the stereotypical roles like Christine Robbins as a love interest for Naoki, Kinnosuke Ikezawa voiced by Shuuhei Sakaguchi a love interest for Kotoko (and a character in which LA supported his romantic goals \"for the most part\") and Yuuki Irie voiced by Romi Park (the snarky little brother of Naoki) and that in itself helped as LA had an obvious annoyance with the snarky annoying Yuuki Irie, but even HE got better over time and development and even the change of settings from highschool to college was a great transitional change, but if the all these can change yet if one of your main characters hardly or takes FAR TOO LONG TO...well again...it becomes a black stain to an otherwise interesting romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nYou could defend Naoki that his cold personality is a hard thing to change as well as his career goals gets in the way of his romantic life, but LA will remind you that Naoki DID really like Kotoko quite early on, he just couldn't express it and fine LA will say that that is a quite honest statement...what LA couldn't understand is even if he couldn't express his true feelings correctly (or at all) even after marriage is him try to resist his personality and personal goals over his romance (only at the last moment for cheap melodrama) because he DOES realize that he is married to someone...he \"is\" a genius right? and fine once again you can even defend that as him being socially unaware and more focused on his career than his romance. Defend Naoki or not, either way LA wanted to pull the clip of Stephen Hawking shouting \"PUT SOME F-*-ING EMOTION INTO IT\" at Naoki for this and easily the source of the romance being quite annoying for the first half well for LA anyways.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully the ending and LA might as well say it the last 6 episodes and Naoki's romantic flaws had improved with every episode and both the romance and drama (medical drama anyways) blended quite well together when before it was clashing quite alot. The last 6 episodes really did make payoff to all the romantic annoyances from Naoki, though the only new flaw LA saw from these last 6 episodes were that the transitions from career life to \"the next step for our two main duo\" were slightly rushed, nonetheless LA was pretty surprised the drama and romance blended especially well even for Kotoko and Naoki AT LAST as well as the minor character sub-plotlines were focused on along with the ending. Oddly the last episode is an aftermath of Episode 24 but the whole meat of Episode 25 is a flashback event and it also felt like it caused Naoki's emotions to be put into question as it was placed after their marriage (as he's similar to Episode 24 but having his constant teasing at the same time when he was suppose to be utterly emotionless towards Kotoko, but you can rule this out \"maybe\" because he's near family relatives thus he opened up but still.), thus LA would just question why couldn't Episode 24 be the final episode, it had a great dramatic and fulfilling conclusion...just seemed that TMS Entertainment needed to fill the quota or something. Nonetheless even with all the flaws and strengths of Itazura na Kiss' final 6 episodes, the \"ending\" (Ep. 24) was a great way to finish what was an annoyingly cold-hearted one-sided romance it was at the beginning to turn it into a nearly solid romantic drama anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt is quite obvious LA's main issue with Itazura na Kiss, Naoki Irie overall brought the entire anime down, he never changes his personality or attitude and he only changes temporarily for cheap melodrama and cling to Kotoko \"just because\" and if the anime series changes and evolves without him then it becomes a HUGE detriment to the anime and even worse in a romantic stance. Itazura na Kiss has it's strengths of the refreshing kind what with it being not merely a highschool romance anime, but it progressing into college and even to their career lives and with the time passing, even it's minor characters changing for the better, but if even Naoki Irie doesn't care about his OWN romantic relationship and evolves without him, why should we care?...Kotoko definitely deserved better than this MUCH more quickly. Itazura na Kiss as a romance is to be seen more as a sidenote melodrama and not until the final 6 episodes it truly becomes a romance, as a drama, it's strengths comes from our main duo's satellite characters more they get sidelined (even though they're the FOCUS) for the most for better development and content as well as again, it's final 6 episodes. Itazura na Kiss skirts the line between an annoying romance and a progressively changing dramatic anime. LA might of gotten Stockholm Syndrome as much as LA hated Naoki quite early on and for the first half of the anime but Itazura na Kiss as a whole is a decent romantic anime, it has it's character flaws and blinded romance elements, but it is it's Itazura na Kiss' other \"features\" from it's progressively evolving settings in life as well as it's likable minor characters as well it's final 6 episodes that holds up which is why LA will call Itazura na Kiss a \"decent romance\"...but it could have been a bit better with our unsympathetic lead putting some god damn effort into the romance department making the romance element a bit better and less annoying...but C'est la vie...or is it C'est Anime?.",

Its a great \"love conquers all story\" (with so much Comedy!)\r\n Art:\r\nThe art for me had a little glitch though I didn't really like how the hair of Kotoko's friend came out.

Ire-kun would say something nasty or something bad would happen and then next minute Ire-kun would be really kind or something really good would happen.\r\nI've seen a lot of mangas and animes with the same story line and similar styled characters (v.clever but cold guy, stupid girl who has a big heart). However despite those similarities. this manga really stood out. Despite the story not going into depth of many characters you still connected to them. For mei really connected with Kotoko. She was sweet and cute and she had such a loving nature that i  find in some of my very best friends. i also felt like she was a great role model. She showed love for others, considerstion, intelligence isn't everything and i thin  st of all love and determination. Actually many characters showed that. But Kotoko stood out. She made me want to work harder for what i want and also to grow up happy. Every time she was sad and cried, i felt like crying. And for me, i don't find that very often. When she held her child in her arms she made me cry because it made me want a family and someone who loves me despite my flaws (not just yet but in the future). I dunno, i just felt so touched by how happy she made me feel. Silly really but it was an interesting experience.\\n\r\nDespite some silly monents in this anime, like the actors speaking English (which sounded ridiculous. totally fake) this anime shines out because it's got a special story where the characters develop over time and make you cry when their sad.\\n\r\nThe reason i give this a 9-10 score is because i couldn't stop watching",

Nothing is done too quickly like in most romance animes. And it shows you the after-effect of their marriage which I thought was brilliant! Many animes have the girl hating the guy or vice versa (In this case it's the guy hating the girl) and after a while he falls in love with her and they expect you to think everything is fine and dandy. This anime shows you how  they also have todeal with problems while they are married which made the anime so realistic and great! \\n\\n\r\nAnd the characters are great since no one changes automatically ( namely Irie). The characters remains basically the same for a long while and they other characters (Kotoko) must persevere (which she does very well I might add.) and stick to their goal!\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this was an amazing anime. I definitely recommend it!",

            "content": "Ha! Funny as heck is what this romance packed a punch in! where should I start...ah yes my good parts and bad parts!\r\nI liked this anime because of it's lively romantic comedy an it's mix of lovey dovey moments. That's what makes this anime so enjoyable. Kotoko Aihara was cute, her friends too. Just the way her personality is made up is most of what Itazura Na Kiss runs it's comedy on! Heck, I think they did a not-so bad job on the laughs, and I had my laughs. Heck, I even had some tearjerkers, and they were nice too. Umm, Irie was absolutely hilarioussometimes. His kid brother too. The lovey dovey scenes were nice, the very few of them that happened, I was intrigued and it felt satisfying for those moments of Irie and Kotoko. They did start getting a tad weaker going through the mid to end parts of the series but they were few of them due to how the plot and the development was based on, which became a hindrance but hey, the moments were neat and nice to have jsut enough to make you smile! Kinnosuke and the gang, well they were funny. I did like Kinnosuke alot though, because he was actually involved in Kotoko's life! The rest of Irie's friends and peers other than Irie's family and all, well... nothing much to say to that. Oh btw there's marriage!\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat I dislike about the anime well haha you guessed it is the story. This is one of those animes that like when you go time traveling in a fast car months and years into the future, and then you finally arrive to the future at ferrari-esque speeds, and then the plot couldn't keep up with the car...turns out the development for the characters that had something going for them just sat out away from the car too...Hence the result, the characters development were fail. This is IMO remember that. I thought I never got to see enough Irie! I thought I understood Kotoko, but nooo...Umm when an issue happens, it's so hasted, and so like..idk...but it's synthetic. It ain't fresh, it isn't lively, it's like the same old boring-looking pizza you see at a pizza shop type of thing, idk how to explain it. The conflicts didn't explain themselves well, the characters appear and reappear whenever they want..remember Kotoko's dad, her little crew, Keira, and Matsumoto...come on... Pretty much, the friendships in this anime are not realistic at all. It doesn't feel irl to me, like...not even a chance. when you combine trying to pull off marriage and have an interesting cast of characters..\\n\\n\r\n.I know it's hard but man I think Itazura na Kiss was greatly held back and hindered by this issue. The animation was whatever, nothing great to look at for me. Music was the same, some parts nice, some parts repetitive. Um yeah..the story was rushed, therefore most of the characters where whacked up and downright boring to watch for me when the high school era subsided other than Kotoko and Irie.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Overall I do recommend this anime for some touchy moments and some laughs, but don't expect to get a whole lot of both in one punch due to the plot development. Actually I'll recommend to most anime romance fans, heck maybe even to all romance fans, because Kotoko is just cute haha! This will get a 7 out of 10 from me.\\n\\n\\n\r\n(I have decided to re-write this review soon, since it's not very accurate and helpful anyway!)\\n\r\nThanks for reading my mediocre review and may God bless you and may you be filled with grace and peace. Amen.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: 10\r\nThe story of Itazura Na Kiss doesn't get a ten because it's an extravagant or complex story; It gets a ten for it's lovely, straightforward, and simple story line. The main appeal of the story is that it doesn't focus on one main part of life like High School life. The author takes the characters through, High School, College, careers, marriage, and even children. Getting to see this gradual move through life and it's struggles is great and entertaining. The main characters relationship is very unique so it keeps the interest up. The comedy is well rounded and fantastic at relieving more stressful moments.Overall, the best part of this is the sheer reality of the show. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Itazura Na Kiss is very dated and so is the art. While it was good art for it's time nowadays its okay at best. It still adheres to the old drawing where everyone looked similar with flat and boring lines.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nToo make up for the art the voice acting in this show is great and the actors definitely suit the characters. The emphasis is always at the right place and really adds to the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are fantastic. Kotoko is clumsy and not talented in anything, but she extremely kind and hardworking while her costar Naoki is good at everything and passionate about nothing. They balance each other perfectly and teach each other lessons. There are also incredibly lovable side characters like Kei chan the overzealous boy who constantly chases after Kotoko with the sweetest of intentions. There is Chris an american girl who falls in love with Japan. There is Naoki's extremely eccentric family including his overserious younger brother and his slightly yet enjoyably crazy mother. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis anime is easy to get into and easy to love it's full of great characters with beautiful personalities that you can't help but watch over to the end.",

            "content": "Love should be a two-way street but this anime, Itazura na Kiss, believes that it can work on a one-way as well.\r\nItazura na Kiss follows Kotoko who is a very devoted high school student not to her studies but to one smart and good-looking boy named Naoki Irie. Rather than being the usual shy girl, Kotoko hands Irie a confession letter hoping that he would accept it but obviously he doesn't. So, she embarks on a journey to win Irie's heart and conveniently, a rather small earthquake destroys her home and she ends up living with Irie. \r\nThe plot follows a very standard shoujo formula:normal girl likes really attractive guy, guy may not like girl (in Irie's case, detests Kotoko), but guy eventually warms up to the girl, and everything is rosy. What makes Itazura na Kiss stand out, in a bad sense, is the second part of the shoujo plotline: guy may not like girl. While it is interesting to see the guy abhor the girl from the start, it does not logically make sense even after their relationship deepens that Irie still despises Kotoko and that Kotoko is alright with Irie being that way. If I was Kotoko, I would leave Irie to go for a man who cares about me and understands my feelings. \\n\\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that this anime is frequently brought up with Clannad: AS. Without spoiling too much, Itazura na Kiss does have a similar story trajectory as Clannad: AS but it fails to live up to the thematic elements masterfully expressed in Clannad: AS. Although I have yet to see the other anime recommended, I believe that Itazura na Kiss is unique for the way it handled the relationship between Irie and Kotoko.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a lively cast of characters in Itazura na Kiss. In fact, I would say that what prevented Itazura na Kiss to be an utter flop is its side characters. They lead interesting lives, come from different backgrounds, and seem to be more human than our two lead characters. \\n\r\nThe two leads are Kotoko and Irie. Kotoko is your usual clumsy shoujo female lead. She is very stubborn in her feelings but I am wary if such a personality is inspiring in real-life compared to the 2D screen. Ladies: if a guy doesn't like you, please don't try to force him to like you. There's a fine line drawn for how passionate you can be for someone. The main male lead is Naoki Irie and he is a very cold man. He is brilliant at his studies, but his relationship IQ is pretty darn low. He emotionally hurts Kotoko many times and although Kotoko is okay with that, I do not forgive him. Like most of the other characters in the anime, I can't quite picture what Kotoko sees in Irie.\\n\r\nKotoko, like any other shoujo female lead, has her entourage of a pretty and vain girl, Satomi, and an ugly girl, Jinko. However, they get little development in the story. If they did, my ear drums would hate to hear more of Jinko's hoarse voice.\\n\r\nAlong with that entourage is Kinnosuke, a devout lover for Kotoko. Ironically, he is portrayed as a clueless guy at the beginning but yet he eventually becomes, in my opinion, the most mature character of the entire cast. He loses Kotoko to Irie but he does not lose sight of his goal to open his own restaurant and starts a new life without Kotoko. He understands how to let go, a notion that the main characters seem to not have registered.\\n\r\nThe other interesting side characters are: Sudou, a fervent tennis player, Nobuhiro, a boy with kidney problems, Keita, the Jacob Black of Itazura na Kiss, and Matsumoto Yuuko, an attractive and potential rival to Kotoko. Their unique stories lend the spice that made Itazura na Kiss bearable. \\n\\n\r\nGiven that Itazura na Kiss was released in 2008, the art is not very pleasing to the eye if you prefer artwork from those released in 2010 and after. However, even for its time, I would say the anime's artwork is not particularly outstanding. The colours are faded and the background art seems to be lifeless. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is forgettable but the second ending music was very catchy. The anime caught me by surprise when it inserted a Japanese rap song in an episode. That was very interesting but perhaps the anime needed that injection of power or else the show would fall off the map. The voice actors were solid but once again, Jinko's voice can shatter mirrors across the galaxy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Itazura na Kiss is an alright anime if you don't look too deeply into the characters. As a fan of romance, I wouldn't rate it very highly but if you enjoy watching anime that takes the relationship beyond high school, then you will enjoy this anime. If you prefer anime with deeper and more human relationships, you may find yourself a hard time getting into Itazura na Kiss. \\n\\n\r\nDid you like the relationship between Kotoko and Irie? Let me know! I would love to hear from you!",

This anime is funny, stupid and cheerful. I was happy to finally see an ending for this funny shoujo anime after the mangaka died and couldn't show anyone how she would like to end it. Okay so this is the plot: Kotoko from class F (yes she is a bit stupid) falls in love with Naoki from class A. He is a bit self-centered and very very smart without even working for it. Shetries to tell him her feelings but being as cold-hearted as he is he ignores her. Because of an incident with her house and their fathers being friends of each other. She somehow comes to live in his house and is making things a bit hard for Naoki. After that his life is changing drastically in a good way and many things happen. But the rest you should really see for yourself, but i can be sure you will enjoy this anime.",

            "content": "Itazura na Kiss in a word: Real\r\nOne very appealing quality about this anime is that all of it is possible. It could very well be a true story. Nothing is too greatly over exaggerated. And it is in it's own way a very sweet story.\r\nI did enjoy it, but I only gave it an overall 8 for a couple reasons.\r\n1. All of the conflict between the leads was due to their lack of communication. One or two problems because of that is no biggie. But dang was it frustrating and annoying knowing that everything could be solved instantly if one of them was just like\"Hey what's up with you doing this?\" \"Oh because this and this and that other thing.\" \"Oh that makes all the sense now. Thanks babe.\" \\n\\n\r\n2. The main girl never grows up. This anime stretches through many years, but the lead girl still acts like a teenager even though she is around 30 years old, and the fact that she is constantly in pig-tails doesn't help either. I wish the creators would have done something to make her seem more mature because of the knowledge she has gained through having a relationship with the male lead. \\n\\n\r\nOther than those two things, it was very enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

ONE : the story didn't take place in high only it went to College and a little bit further * don't want to spoil ;P *. TWO : i read the manga and there was CLEARLY a BIIIIIIIG difference in the drawings, in the mangathe drawings looked sketchy . Anyways this anime is worth the time i dont suggest reading the manga though.",

            "content": "Itazura na Kiss...already just from the title comes to me as an interesting anime. This kind of genres i prefer if i have to tell the truth, but on the other hand i was a little disappointed with some of the part.  Iam new in this kind of interest but I will try to be as objective as possible.\r\nAt first I was a little disappointed, after the first few episodes, I began to be impressed with storyline. When She moved with her father to his best friend, did not expect that her dreams slowly begin to fill. \r\nNaoki\u00b4s character wasnt easy to beat upbut she undestand that very well and didnt give up till last moment, heh i think this was the right reason why d he falls in love with her. All her weaknesses were balanced by her determination and spirit to not give up.\\n\r\nI\u00b4d like Naoki\u00b4s outside \"perfection\" but from the inside he was empty...his feelings and everyting around. It felt as if he was looking for himself, and gradually he understands slowly that only one person is trying to help him.\\n\\n\r\nBut i really dont understand his behavior after marrying her, he was still cold-hearted on her, even she was his wife... . Its not just something stupid, in my opinion, if someone confess and is going to marry girl, he should be at least a little friendly... am i not right?..\\n\r\nFor the story: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt...hm lets see, perfect animation, but her eyes looks really big it was a bit exaggerated. Also in the episodes where she was waiting for a child She looked overdone fat.\\n\r\nimho 7/10\\n\\n\r\nsimple ratings for sound in my opinion:\\n\r\nOpenings 1,2  10/10 perfectly fit\\n\r\nEnding 1         6/10 nothing for my ears but it fits:P\\n\r\nEnding 2          10/10 same as openings...\\n\r\npassage song between 3/10 i dont have nothing what should i say, i dislike it.\\n\r\nSounds Overall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were created great, personalities fits to them, i dislike Naoki as i said before after marriage, and Kotoko,hm how could i put it, just dislike her for  falling in love for no reason, but i think she didnt know about his personality before, that doesnt matter anyway because she loves him so much that she could forget something like that and overlooked it. It really deserves my admiration.\\n\r\nCharacters overall 9/10\\n\\n\r\ni Really felt great through watching episodes of Itazura no Kiss, it was still good to see chars. grow as the story progressed.\\n\\n\r\nThank you all^^\\n\\n",

This might be why many people may enjoy this type of anime. \r\nHOWEVER,  the producers made the characters so extremely opposites that sometimes I questioned whether or not a rock was smarter than the girl. In one scene, she couldn't even read regular japanese that an elementary student could read. Her stupidness was so annoyingto watch. The guy, on the other hand, was just a smarta$$ the entire time. There is a limit to how arrogant you can be. Although I really hated the girl, I kind of felt sorry for her when he was such a jerk to her. Then again, she kind of did bad things to him, so I guess it was kind of justified. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, this is probably one of the worst romance anime I've ever seen, and the first one I've ever dropped. The entire premise of the story was too painful for me to continue.",

            "content": "I have seen several love comedy animes, but this one is by far the most satisfying. Not only do you get the love scenes you dream of seeing when you watch a love anime, but you also enjoy the progression towards those scenes. The plot is somewhat predictable, but it contains a large amount of surprises that one never sees in other animes. The characters have a very distinct personality, especially the main male character (Irie) whose outlook on things can never be predicted. The main protagonist is a  refreshing comical character one needs to keep a light air in the anime. While otheranimes have tiring situations where the viewer feels discouraged about whether the protagonist will succeed, this show keeps several backup characters to keep the audience's spirit high. \\n\\n\r\nA final detail that this anime especially delivers is a most satisfying ending. One is always prepared for a teary eyed ending that leaves the storyline incomplete, but this plot does not leave you hanging. It goes far enough to leave the story feeling complete and with a happy ending. It also makes sure to not have any fillers, yes, there are NO filler episodes (with the exception of a special episode at the end of the series). Each episode played a large part in making the plot be what it is.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely suggest this anime to anyone who desires a filling serving of a love story that isn't too serious in dialogue, but serious enough to make the audience want to stand up and cheer for a job well done.",

            "content": "For the record, I'd like to start out by saying that all you idiots who are ganging up on Kotoko on her apparent masochist love she holds for Irie when you haven't even finished the series.  All you morons should finish before judging.  I can understand you disliking the series but for god's sake if you're going to bash a show at least watch it all the way through.  And to all you Kotoko haters out here, she realized: \"YOU CANT HELP WHO YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH\" which you guys seem to mistake for masochism.  And now to our level-headedanime lovers.  I am a person who watches anime with no expectations for the start of the show because I want to see what the anime is trying to do.  The mark of a good anime in my opinion is not necessarily a happy ending, or even a good romance; a great anime in my opinion makes you think like the characters and understand them.  Itazura na Kiss has one of the most realistic takes on romance I've seen since Cross Games.  Kotoko is the lovable but dumb, not ugly but not a stud main girl lead who always tries her hardest.  Pretty common storyline, but like a previous review stated, \"It's not the end result but the journey,\" this phrase suits this anime perfectly.  Irie is the typical cold-hearted (sometimes vilified) OOD (object of desire) of Kotoko.  Its rare to see cold rejection turn into true love *cough cough* but InK really allows Kotoko and Irie's relationship develop into something truly amazing.  To be honest while watching this show they were the perfect couple for this reasoning.  Irie is amazing at everything but is cold and disinterested while Kotoko isnt particularly great at anything except her enthusiasm to help others and her determination.  They're a perfect match, he's the talent and she's the inspiration and drive.  Before you write this show off, give it a chance.  Oh and on a personal note the person who loved keita should suck it i hated him lol xD",

I have never read the manga, mainly because I didn't like the drawings very much. The anime art was much better, and I loved the ending. They should have continued! This anime also inspired me to study medicine. Those of you which have watched it will understand why. \r\nIf anything, I'd say the anime escalates quite quickly, thought it has to because there are only 25 episodes. They're in college one episode, andmaybe three episodes later, they'll be in the hospital. I don't think there's anything wrong with this because it is an anime about life, after all. \\n\r\nWatch this anime - you won't regret it!",

            "content": "I clearly remember that after watching the Korean drama \"Mischievous Kiss\" I promised myself that I will never watch the anime it was adapted from. And yet, here I am, finishing the whole thing in just a day. So, for the sake of the k-culture fans who are interested in giving the original story a try, I decided to write a quick comparison between the two versions.\r\nSo, \"Itazura na Kiss\" has the same shallow, shoujo-ish beginning which leads to death by cheesiness. Come on now, no matter how much I try to ignore some facts, it is still clear that the debut of the seriesis by no means realistic. The drama has the same crappy start, so I guess they are a bit similar.\\n\\n\r\nBut after a few episodes (very shoujo-ish, I might add), the plot gets interesting. This is the first anime I have seen that actually focuses a bit on the life after marriage. That is definitely one of the reasons why you should check it out. Also, the fact that the guy is actually confessing, feeling jealousy and expressing himself (are you reading this, Kim HyunJoong-sshi? - the drama lacks a bit on his part, but he's a bishounen, so whatever), makes the storyline easier to digest. I can honestly say that the drama doesn't even try to let the plot evolve, keeping it to a merely shoujo-ish setting. So yeah, depends on your liking.\\n\\n\r\nStill, the anime presents itself with a crappy image. Apart from the pretty artwork, there is this white filter or something that forces me to make weird faces as I am trying to get used to it. It might be because of the stream I used to watch it, so if that's the case, consider this comment worthless and go on.^^\\n\\n\r\nI hated the male seyuu's voice. (Naoki's, of course) ^^ He reminds me a bit of Jun Fukuyama's voice in Special A, and that makes me cringe. (I really, really hate Fukuyama in Special A - and in most of his other animes, but I guess someone will be coming after me if I say that) So yeah, when it comes to voices, I would have replaced Daisuke Hirakawa with Kim HyunJoong anytime. But apart form that, everything's completely fine with me.\\n\\n\r\nAs a conclusion, I really enjoyed this anime. It gives off that special \"something\", even though it is as cheesy as a shoujo anime can be. Even though I cannot rate it higher than 8 (because seriously now, I never rated a shoujo thing higher than 8, for obvious reasons), I really enjoyed watching it. ^^",

It's just about a girl who never gives up.\r\nThe conversations between the characters aren't that good. You can almost predict what each character is going to say because they almost never do something unexpected. I was sometimes really irritated by what the heroine said because she never stays true to her word.\r\nThe animation was annoying whenI started watching. After a while I got used to it but it still wasn't good. The faces seem deformed when viewed from other angels.\\n\\n\r\nI really didn't like this series at first.

            "content": "This is my first anime review, so bear with me please! There are going to be some spoilers, just as a warning, though I'll try to keep them limited. This isn\u2019t exactly the kind of anime you watch because you don\u2019t know the ending, though, so I don\u2019t feel too bad about it. :)\r\nI\u2019m giving Itazura na Kiss an overall score of 7/10. This is because though there are many issues within it, it still is, at its core, an earnest and heartwarming story that I believe is worth the watch if you\u2019re interested in the shoujo genre, especially if you\u2019re sick and tired ofseeing anime about relationships that never actually come to fruition. However, as I said, there were definite flaws that I should probably address first.\\n\r\nMy biggest gripe with this anime is the pacing. The anime starts off really well; the premise is interesting, albeit unrealistic (but hey, you don\u2019t exactly watch a shoujo for realism!).  A few episodes in, however, you start realizing that the anime occasionally jumps large gaps of time from episode to episode, or even sometimes within a single episode. It quickly becomes evident that this is done in attempt to jam pack Kotoko and Irie\u2019s entire relationship into the 25 episode series, and it does so with limited effectiveness. These skips in time (sometimes only a few weeks, sometimes a few months, sometimes even a few years) make the plot feel unlevel and make the characters\u2019 intentions feel misplaced. This is specifically true in Irie\u2019s case. I honestly feel as though the true climax of the story for me is the first time Irie kisses Kotoko, because up until that point the setting has been constant (high school), and both Kotoko and Irie\u2019s growth in emotion and confliction has been displayed. You can really tell why he kisses her and what he meant by it. It was, to me, a great platform for the series to take off. However, instead of doing just that and further developing their relationship, the time skips continue and the show begins to grow much more one-sided (primarily focusing on Kotoko\u2019s inner troubles and never again voicing Irie\u2019s), which makes it difficult to understand why Irie has such a change of heart when he does decide to be with Kotoko 7 someodd episodes later. It doesn\u2019t feel natural. You can connect why Irie would want her, but you never are shown this transition in any palpable way. This, in combination with the ever-changing setting due to how jam-packed this anime is, makes the large progressions in their relationship feel a little lacking in substance; they even feel somewhat ridiculous at times. You also begin to lose sight of the roots of the relationship this way. However, this isn\u2019t to say that the tender moments aren\u2019t tender, because they are. It\u2019s what makes the show altogether easily watchable. \\n\r\nThe secondary characters are fine; mostly inoffensive and decent compliments to the story. One shoutout I\u2019ll make is to Irie\u2019s brother, Yuuki, whose role truly helped to enhance the story, despite him lacking in airtime as the show progressed. While Kotoko\u2019s two best school friends, Jinko and Satomi, are fairly forgettable, and Jinko\u2019s VA grates me like no other, they straight out disappear around 2/3rds of the way into the series. When I say they\u2019re forgettable, that doesn\u2019t mean I outright want to forget them! This is, I\u2019m assuming, because Kotoko changes her line of study, but it was pretty jarring to me that they\u2019re recurring characters in the series up to one point where they just stop showing up until the very end. \\n\r\nThere are lots of slip-ups like this throughout the anime that annoyed me a little, but I don\u2019t want to be too nitpicky. The character slip-ups are, however, mostly due to how much substance they attempted to cram into this show. If they had taken more time with it, most of these issues could have been remedied. \\n\r\nThe music was effective, the seiyuus (apart from Jinko, though that\u2019s more personal preference) were as well \u2013 I found Kotoko\u2019s excited, chipper voice extremely versatile and fit for a good shoujo heroine, and Irie\u2019s disinterested drawl definitely did the job. The OP is one of my favorite anime OPs I have heard in a long time; it\u2019s very catchy and nostalgic. The art isn't dazzling, but isn't hard on the eyes, either.\\n\r\nAnd again, this anime is, at its core, sincere in its message \u2013 that intelligence isn\u2019t all there is to a person, and that being diligent, determined, and earnest can truly pay off in the end. Kotoko\u2019s character is a strong point in the series, though mostly due to the fact that she IS the heroine and does get the most time devoted to her and her problems. You really do see her subtly evolve yet remain ever-strong and ever-determined (a highlight for me was in episode 22, where you see her hard work academically pay off in a real-life setting). The sweet spots are definitely sweet, and are sure to leave anyone who allows the pacing problems to sit well with them aww out loud (at least I did). \\n\r\nI hope I didn\u2019t deter anyone from watching this anime! From the slim pickings of the shoujo world, Itazura na Kiss definitely stands out as a decent choice. It doesn\u2019t live up to the standards of Toradora or LoveCom, but it shines as an easy-watch for any lover of pure, shoujo-style romance.",

            "content": "After reading reviews and watching some episodes again, I have come to the conclusion I need to change my rating and review of this anime. The first time I watched it I thought it was great mostly because it was the first anime I have watched that goes beyond high school for a couple and into their marriage lives.\r\nBut now that I am older I just expect more from anime and realized this anime doesn't fully deliver.\r\nI'm not big on taking lessons and morals from anime but the constant recurrence of Kotoko chasing a guy who at first doesn't care for her, you can't helpbut realize that the writers were trying to romanticize what is still kind of a one-sided relationship.\\n\\n\r\nSince I rated the characters as a three, I'll start there. Kotoko is a dumb, clumsy yet determined girl who is in class F. I'm really under the impression she has a learning disability. She falls for \"the smarts guy in possibly Japan\" and tries to give him a confession that he quickly turns down.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so thus begins her long five-year journey into winning his love.\\n\\n\r\nNaoki is supposed to be some genius who is so smart that he does not have to try and put effort into anything he does. Really he is just another stereotype who is smart but is a robot and confused when it comes to emotions like love or jealousy. So as far as I am concerned, he's pretty dumb too.\\n\\n\r\nAnd really his main characteristics that are memorable would have to be his dull personality. He's really robotic and when he does say a full sentence, it's usually an insult.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is so cliche it's painful. the guys that like Kotoko are nice and the girls who like Naoki are snobby like him. And yet Naoki and Kotoko are a good match?\\n\\n\r\nHe treats her any kind of way and she just takes it. Then a dozen people have to show her how bad the relationship is before she gets to a breaking point but then when she does leave, she is roped back in with sweet words or his mom interferes.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a totally horrible anime, but it's not an anime to watch if you are looking for chemistry and actual romance. This anime kind of borders along the emotional abuse line.",

In total I've watched all twenty-six episodes twice. Both times I loved it!! I would definitely recommend this to all of my friends!!",

I was so frustrated by how rude Naoki was and how dumb and useless they made Kotoko seem (though she was likable throughout). As someone who really values deep, thoughtful characters, I was very skeptical.  I think it was the second season that totally changed my mind.  When they started taking the relationship to the next level, I found myself really enjoying seeing how the twoprogressed together and was impressed by the amount of character development seen in both mains.  As soon as they gave Kotoko a dream other than to be with Naoki, I found myself really enjoying the anime.  I loved how both characters evolved and we came to appreciate both sets of strengths and weaknesses.I loved where they went with the story and I thought the ending was super satisfying. \\n\\n\r\n The music wasn't mesmerizing and the art wasn't like exceptionally gorgeous (though, of course, it was still very nice), but the anime was really fun.  If you're feeling down and need a fun, light-hearted pick-me-up romantic anime to watch, Itazura na Kiss is your anime.  Definitely recommend.",

But what I did like was the story behind it. Great way to pass the day overall.\r\nOh the onlyother thing is that once you get past a certain point (sorry don't remember the episode #) the anime seems to pass time fairly quickly. \"1 month later\" here and \"4 years later\" there and before you know it it's 9 years later. No joke, at one point I was thinking we were just a couple of months ahead and then I found out 4 years had passed ... :(",

The amount of emotions and character development just doesnt stop. There is hardly any cliff hangers which forces you to watch the next episode, no no no my friend, I continued watching purely because I just wanted more. Now, onto the review\r\nStory: \r\nMany viewers would probably judge this anime by its cover; a typical Shoujo and predictable. In a way, it kinda does, nevertheless, the story remained pure and innocent from start to finish. The concept of growingup and innocent love is just so beautifully portrayed. Not only does the story start from a simple high school crushes, the story continues further into the future, you really get to know the characters and the amount of emotions put into every scene. Another thing which was very well done was the pace of the story. What some viewers must understand is that this anime takes place in a matter of years, unlike other shows where the whole season was only.. say.. 1 school year. The events which takes place in the story and the emotional reactions was just so beautifully constructed and REAL. This story, didnt focus on any love triangle madness like other Shoujos, this one really focused on their bonding and self-fulfillment. And nevertheless, the ending was satisfying, no loose ends, even supporting characters gets their own closure :3 This is the type of storyline that I personally, speaking from someone from 6 years following the airing of this anime, is always seeking in todays mixed society. A nice, mellow, and smooth storyline \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: \\n\r\nFor its time, The art and drawings were well constructed. The backgrounds were beautiful. Im no art person but it was pleasant to watch :3 As for the sound and music. The OP and ED really set the mood. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nOh My Lord, there is a mix of characters which just makes this show so enjoyable and wonderful! To start of, Kotoko. At first impression, She made herself out to be quite annoying and persistent and someone clueless on her surroundings but nevertheless, she was always so passionate and caring for the people around her. She was so entertaining to watch. and to see such character development in her just really made her pairing with Naoki more enjoyable to watch. Naoki was somewhat predictable but nevertheless, he really filled the void. His 'cold-heart' behavior just made all the sweet moments worthwhile. What i loved about this anime is that none of the characters  (except 1) was annoying. Even the rivals, strangely. You just cant help but love them all.. especially the Mum :P \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nOH, believe me, I enjoyed this anime to the NEXT level. I with they would make more stories like this. This kind of anime really was somewhat of a relaxing anime and something somewhat different. No love triangle mess, just pure love and journey of the characters hopes, goals and dreams. I will definitely will not forget this anime for a long long time.",
