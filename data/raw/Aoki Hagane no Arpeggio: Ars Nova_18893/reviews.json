            "content": "Before deciding if you should watch Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova, you should probably ask yourself if military science fiction is your type of anime. Military science fiction often takes the idea of military but also fuses it with supernatural themes with flavors of science and artificial warfare. There are a lot of ideas that plays around with military sci-fi including alien invasions, mecha, or space wars. So what happens when you take a bunch of mental models that resembles the characteristics of female characters and puts them into total warfare? Simple. You get Arpeggio of Blue Steel: Arsa Nova.\r\nThe series itself is basedoff of the manga of the same name written by Ark Performance. The premise sets takes place in a setting of an alternate history although there are many similar paths crossed. For one, that path involves the Japanese attempting to recover their nation through engaging trades. Unfortunately, its enemy forces have powerful weapons of war known as the \u201cFleet of the Flog\u201d. These are essentially weapons that has turned the tides in battle and pushed back its adversaries to the brink of despair. Luckily, there is some hope because of a certain naval group that is capable of dealing with this threat. They are called the Blue Steel and this series chronicles their journey.\\n\\n\r\nArpeggio of Blue Steel might be a series that people would sway their heads away at first. The idea is hardly original as demonstrated in previous sci-fi war theme series such as Strike Witches, Tactical Roar, Blue Submarine No. 6, and Full Metal Panic. Potential viewers for the series might also sway their heads away as lead director Seiji Kishi is in charge of this adaptation. His mediocre direction of recent anime series based on adaptations such as Devil Survivor 2: The Animation and Persona 4 had numerous problems. Therefore, this show might initially be met with some controversy. For me, the series has its ups and downs. To call it a scientific masterpiece would be over exaggerating but it\u2019s also not a waste of time to watch either. Because of its premise, this show itself does set itself differently with its cast of characters and brings the military science fiction theme in a different light.\\n\\n\r\nTaking place in the future of 2056, technology has far advanced than our modern world. Just imagine in over 40 years what our world would be like. For the characters in this series, they\u2019re not living at home relaxing but are on the war zone to carry out an important mission. That mission is no walk in the park because of the obstacles ahead. Taken from an objective standards, the obstacles comes into two forms. The most obvious involves the \u2018Fleet of Fog\u2019, fictional avatars named after non-fictional battleships. The other obstacle involves also dealing with humans and corrupt governments that wants to achieve various goals with their own deeds. It\u2019s a bloody revolution and no one wants to play nice.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters from this series includes the captain of the Blue Steel, Chihaya Gonzou. He can be described as a serious man with tactical mind of a leader with the ability to lead his crew through obstacles. However, he can\u2019t do this alone without the help of his crew members. Among this group is a prominent avatar with code name 104 that also goes by the name \u201cIona\u201d. Throughout the series, she describes herself as a weapon born to fight with no other purpose. Ever since she joined the human side, the government and various factions has their eyes set on her. Iona can be easily described as a giant killer. She may be have a small body structure but Iona\u2019s abilities shines in battle many times thanks to her initiate ability to eradicate emotions and fight. This is proven early on when the crew takes on Takao, another human avatar of a Fog cruiser. Unfortunately, there\u2019s hardly anything we can bring out from Iona. She\u2019s a character that is surrounded in mystery with her stoic behavior. Her relationship with Gonzou and the crew can be described as professional although throughout the series, she questions herself exactly who or what she is.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that also brings another point. The concept of more human behaviors.\\n\\n\r\nLater on in the series, other Fog Ships are introduced that becomes a threatening factor to Blue Steel. Their purpose is set on destroying the privateers. However, it\u2019s noticeable that they later on question their own purpose. This doesn\u2019t just include Iona but also other Fog ships especially after they encounter a human girl. The encounter brings out a variety of human behavior including responsibility, guardianship, and even friendship. It\u2019s questionable whether the characters in this series can truly establish a bond between Fog Ships and humans. Humans seems to fear Fog Battleships while the latter seems to despise humans for weaknesses. On the other hand, some of them clearly demonstrates human behavior ranging from love, care, jealousy, and even betrayal. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself follows the premise well with its journey but does derive from the manga quite a bit with certain omitted scenes. It cuts out parts with this adaptation involving some of the comedic dialogues/scenes. Most importantly though is perhaps character development during the journey that is minimized in this series. Being a one-cour show, this anime suffers problems with rushing. Therefore, expect certain factors that might not match up in the end. There\u2019s also a lack of exploration in terms of characters\u2019 backgrounds. Most of them are vaguely expressed by whom they are presently. The lack of background histories can become a problem as viewers might have more questions with no concrete answers. The main protagonists (crews of the Blue Steel) are also difficult to get attached because they hardly get any development. In fact, most of the Fog ships gets more development than Gonzou and his crew which is a down factor for Blue Steel. However, one certain main character also has a highlight purpose because of who she is. In fact, it brings out the human vs Fog ships\u2019 personality that tests new boundaries of these artificial weapons of war. For the Fog ships, some of them learns from these behaviors and demonstrates their own ideologies. \\n\\n\r\nAction wise, the series makes sense although the CGI might take awhile to get used to. As the series takes mostly in a naval environment, most of the battle takes place at sea. The battleships themselves are modeled after real life naval ships. Hence, they are designed with devastating firepower that proves itself in battle. Most of the Fog ships possesses different personalities that reflects their designs. The weapons used throughout the series often includes missiles, force shields and wave motion cannons that clearly outshines our modern world\u2019s technology. The spectacular results of these weapons bring can be pleasing to the eye especially when the Fog ships themselves becomes what they are designed for - annihilation. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is also comedy present throughout the series whether it\u2019s obsessive love, yuri-like fantasies, or the awkwardness in the form of a stuffed animal. Some dialogues are also mixed with words that can bring out laughter with its implications of suggestive factors involving \u201cengines\u201d and little misunderstandings. \\n\\n\r\nWhat isn\u2019t pleasing though should again be addressed to the overall adaptation. The way it is constructed omits very important details involving Gonzou. The lack of exploration involving his parents or past is a serious drawback that is hard to redeem itself. Most characters from the original Blue Steel barely get any of their own spotlights. It turns out that Iona would be the ace despite her soulless personality. But without a clear background or exploration of her past, Iona also becomes a poorly constructed character. It\u2019s a shame that our main characters just doesn\u2019t shine as much as one would hope...\\n\\n\r\nJudging by art standards, Arpeggio of Blue Steel matches well by science fiction means. The way most of the characters are designed given them an impression that they are weapons of war (Fog Ships) or humans whom stands up against what comes at them. (Blue Steel) The animation studio SANZIGEN is not well known though in the anime industry. They are known for only a few science fiction theme series including 009: RE: Cyborg and Black Rock Shooter; the latter that received very mixed reactions. Fortunately, the background of the series redeems itself with glorious naval features, explosive battles, and science fiction aesthetics. The drawback would be the CGI that makes the show itself less powerful with its computer generated graphics. There\u2019s also some fan service usually featuring the Fog Ships that might generate some reactions of eye rolling especially with the way camera angles are pointed at.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is pretty well done by OST standards. Most battle scenes are accompanied with a dynamic beat and dominant intensity. It brings out the intense environment that exists in this alternate historical world. The OP song \u201cSavior of Song\u201d is well performed by Nano (Btooom!, Phi Brain: Puzzle of God 2, Ark IX) with vibrations of energy. The ED song on the other hand provides feedback of a more calm atmosphere similar to some of the comedic scenes in the series. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this show can be a mixed bag depending on your experience with science fiction anime. The idea of a scientific mission sounds engaging but the plot itself is unimpressive as result of its poor adaptation. This is mentioned before because the way it cuts itself out that omits several important factors. It destroys the development of our main characters and where they came from. However, there are themes that are explored that can be interesting to take note of. The problem might be that the answer is for viewers to decide in the end with its ambiguous nature. Luckily, the action, powerful OST, and comedy will definitely leave you with impressions. Some characters (especially the Fog ships) do get development so expect moments where you\u2019ll get to like them more. The fact remains ultimately is that military science fiction anime can take different turns and angles. For Arppegio of Blue Steel, it steered in a path that defines warfare in its own way.\\n",

            "content": "In the year 2039, the combined naval forces of humanity suffer a crushing defeat at the hands of a military force with weapons technology that far surpasses their own. The fearsome assailants? A group of heavy warships, termed \u201cThe Fleet of Fog,\u201d who are commanded by \u201cmental models,\u201d robot-like representations of the minds of the battleships that take the physical form of little girls dressed in frilly clothing. Fast-forward seventeen years, and one of these mental models, named Iona, approaches a human naval cadet named Gunzou out of the blue, offering herself (and, by extension, the advanced Fog submarine she represents) to Gunzou to command.Gunzou accepts the offer, and embarks on a mission, piloting the Fog submarine to defend humanity using the very weapons that almost brought about its end. Meanwhile, Iona and several of the other Fog mental models appear to be warming up to Gunzou and developing emotions, which mental models are not supposed to possess. It's almost impossible to not note that this entire premise seems like a very elaborate way of creating a scenario in which scantily-clad girls say things along the lines of \u201cyou're my captain, please pilot me.\u201d Judging a book by its cover is, of course, wrong, but having thought about Arpeggio of Blue Steel for longer than I ever really wanted to, I don't feel too bad about saying that that initial impression was ultimately pretty close to the money.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps fitting for a story that's partially about machines coming to terms with life, the world of Arpeggio seems to be constructed from the ground up using pure CGI. Everything about it, from characters to ships, bears the obvious stamp of computer generation, and this, unfortunately, is CG of a cheap-looking and ugly breed. If there's one thing the show consistently gets right, it's light\u2014explosions, lasers, computer displays and the like look good more often than not, but that's about the only visual aspect that I can genuinely compliment, and I'm reaching pretty far for that one. Backgrounds and other such niceties don't look so nice, with the ocean in particular often being rendered as a noxious purple-black cloud which bears shockingly little resemblance to a body of water. The design and color choices are poor\u2014the characters all have the same pale, waxy complexion and widely spaced eyes. Add some otherworldly hair and wardrobe malfunctions, and everyone starts to look pretty ridiculous. Add some extraordinarily stiff animation (all characters move with an awkward, jerking hobble, all ships move at a stuttering crawl), and, frankly, you'd be hard-pressed to tell who is supposed to be a human and who is supposed to be a member of the more robotic Fog; they all look equally like paste-colored marionettes. This condition is only worsened by the show's repeated attempts to force its decidedly mechanical characters to do something sexy; it's like watching aliens awkwardly attempt to imitate aspects of human sex appeal, and something about it is strangely disquieting. The core of the show's aesthetic is thoroughly repulsive to no real artistic or thematic end.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, mostly a mix of cheesy techno and uninspired string/horn compositions that seem tailored to fit the seafaring nature of the series, soars to mediocre heights. Okay, cheesy techno aside, some of it actually isn't too bad, but variety is an issue; this is one of those shows that have two or three songs for battle, two or three songs for dramatic moments, and a few minutes' worth of atmospheric noises that get recycled over and over again. The music direction is sub-par, with tracks often starting too late to have any impact on a given scene, or starting too early and overriding dialogue. Sound certainly isn't the show's worst department\u2014actually, by simple process of elimination, it might be the best\u2014but suffice to say it doesn't excel or help cover the show's weaknesses, as good music sometimes can.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at Arpeggio's story in a \u201cbig picture\u201d light reveals interesting results in that, at the end of the day, there's really no detail to it whatsoever. The world-building is virtually nonexistent, to the point where I'd venture to say there's little that you couldn't learn about the world of Arpeggio from reading a three-sentence plot synopsis. The show proffers a fairly elaborate premise, but it stubbornly refuses to answer any questions about its overarching plot or setting\u2014not the ones that will naturally occur to you, and, perhaps worse, not even the ones that it explicitly raises. Among the former will be perfectly logical ponderings, the answers to which would be required to achieve a minimum amount of richness in the setting, like: In a war where both sides have advanced futuristic technology, why aren't there any airplanes? If the Fog mental models are nearly indestructible and visually indistinguishable from human beings, why don't the Fog just send them ashore to covertly destroy vital targets? And so on. Among the latter will be vital, should-really-be-answered queries along the lines of \u201cwhat are the Fog?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nNo, seriously, they never even attempt to address that. The Fog battleships repeatedly refer to themselves as \u201cjust weapons\u201d that are \u201cprogrammed to obey the Admirality Code\u201d (the Admirality Code being an ill-defined set of rules, first mentioned three-quarters of the way into the show, that governs the actions of the battleships). This leads to the assumption that the Fleet of Fog are just tools, and the true masterminds behind the Fog invasion lie elsewhere; weapons require weapons designers, and programs require programmers. The show hints at human interactions with the Fog\u2014it's suggested that the main character's father defected to the side of the Fog\u2014but the idea lies abandoned and utterly unexplored. The mysteries are never solved. Much of the show is spent fighting a shadow enemy whose nature, origin, and motivations remain completely veiled. Several episodes of the series even have the audacity to end with a taunting overlay of text which reads (presumably referring to the Fog): \u201cWhere do we come from? What are we? Where are we going?\u201d Even after the credits rolled at the end of the final episode, I could still only answer all three with \u201cI don't know,\u201d which spells trouble. \\n\\n\r\nAll of that might be forgivable if the setting and war were only a backdrop used to stimulate some excellent characterization\u2014such tactics have been known to work. And, honestly, that might be what the series is going for. Whatever else might be wrong with it, it does expend a fair bit of effort (largely wasted effort, but genuine effort nonetheless) trying to explore its characters. Sometimes it comes within arm's reach of the right notes. Like Haruna, an especially cold and vicious Fog mental model, forming a bond with a perceptive young girl who emotionally disarms her, or Iona's struggle to obey Gunzou's orders while knowing that obeying could potentially cause his death. Those aren't bad ideas at all. The show wants, desperately, to have characters who change, and change they do. It's telegraphed at us, and not very subtle, but it's there.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that the impetus for change is missing. The series has flawed internal logic\u2014it presents the Fog mental models as thoughtless machines, explicitly stating that they are governed by programs that cannot learn from past mistakes, adapt, or feel. There is never a convincing reason given regarding why they suddenly adopt emotions and human values. And that's kind of a big deal. I don't care how heartwarming the story of a little girl is, or how charismatic a sailor is\u2014if you put robots who have no capacity for emotion next to them, the robots will not suddenly be moved to tears and love. No amount of emotion can overwhelm something that is literally incapable of feeling emotion. Talk to a wall for a little while and you're likely to notice that, no matter how much and how loud you talk, the wall does not respond. This is because your voice's volume does not alter the complete and utter inability of the wall to comprehend and reproduce your language of choice. Same difference here; the presence of emotion in the outside world can't simply inspire emotion in the void of a computer. That's deeply flawed thinking which would require a workaround within the context of the series. If there were some sort of external explanation provided, even a cheap one like \u201cturns out there was a hidden emotion switch in the Fog after all,\u201d some sense might be made of the situation, but, predictably, there's nothing. Which sucks, because that means that half of the equation is missing. If a character changes, I'd like to know why it's happening, or it's just as bad as having a character who is static and unmoving. If you present characters as machines, and then they suddenly sprout the mindset of normal human beings for no real reason, it defeats the entire narrative purpose of presenting them as machines in the first place. It essentially strips the characters of their distinguishing features, and adds a big tint of insincerity to everything that they go through.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing that might have saved Arpeggio would be the battles. It sounds next to impossible to screw up \u201cgiant sentient battleships blow each other to hell,\u201d and while good execution of that concept would not necessarily result in a good series, it would at least provide an audience with one reason, lacking any others, to watch it. But even this somehow manages to go awry. Never has large-scale warfare been so boring. The battles, though sometimes as long as ten or fifteen minutes, are dreadfully uneventful, usually consisting of a lot of technobabble about force fields and gravitron cannons and the like. The more strategy-focused crowd will be glad to know that our fearless captain, Gunzou, is the proud creator of such novel naval warfare tactics as \u201cwait for the enemy to fire a bunch of torpedoes at us, then dodge them, then fire back and hope it works.\u201d Battles are regularly concluded with routine and anticlimactic solutions, such as the above, or solutions that appear out of nowhere, such as Gunzou realizing that he can just use some weapon or defensive feature of the submarine that the audience didn't even know existed. Even when things do get dire for all of those aboard, the lack of emotional resonance in the writing assures that the tension level remains at zero.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I'm getting at is that this show consists of misstep after misstep, and they often work together to form seamless spans of pointlessness which would be a waste of time for anyone to endure of their own free will. The lack of world-building and knowledge about the Fog coincides nicely with the characterization issues to form a gaping hole where the compelling internals should be. The dreadful animation and boring battles sync up all too well, affording the audience a chance to stare at a low-stakes game of chicken that isn't even produced well enough to serve as an eye-candy distraction. When all was said and done, I came away with the impression that I had basically watched a show about things who look like girls that do stuff for some reason. And I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone.",

            "content": "On the surface Arpeggio has a few detractors but if you allow people to finish airing their subjective complaints about how CG never blends well with anime, the harem genre is overused and how they don\u2019t want to be made to remember complicated words like Super gravity Cannon and Klein\u2019s field, you\u2019ll find that Arpeggio has a decent story, a setting with rich possibilities heavily untapped by the anime world, interesting characters and an all but obvious moral lesson at the end.\r\nFor 7 years the Fleet of Fog, an armada of highly advance naval vessels have taken over earthly waters, with every attempt to reclaimback the waters by humanity crushed. Chihaya Gunzou is a student at a naval academy who one day is approached by a girl named Iona who introduces herself as a member of the Fog. The first episode isn\u2019t kind to those looking for a subtle introduction as it is packed full of content, the series sense of immediacy may overwhelm some as in only the first episode it entails storyline, introductions, info dumps and even flash backs, all this equals to the series greatest weakness, its length, which I\u2019ll talk about later. Chihaya Gunzou\u2019s fleet is tasked with delivering a new weapon to America soon after with the Fog in his path leading to naval confrontations. The series can also be praised for its sound sense of tactical warfare as the battles take a balanced approach between stratagem and action orientation, the chemistry of Gunzo and his crewmates also deserve praise as everybody is well aware of their objectives and every line a character speaks out deserves just cause and not just for the sake of a seiyuu getting lines, however this is only in combat.\\n\\n\r\nThe fleet of the Fog being all AIs have a set of logical reasoning they follow called the Admiralty code, which a few of the fog members later on start to question, the series takes a very nice new dimension when this new plot element comes into play that suddenly give these formerly one dimensional characters a lot of depth, all of a sudden characters who one might think were nothing more than opponents the main cast might hurdle over, suddenly are given meaning and purpose, and the storyline sees a vast change mostly for the better. Although some people might complain about the existence of the mental models, the way the battleships take human form, keep in mind that without this the members of the fog would be nothing more than your casual unknown evil group trying to take over the world, their presentation to the physical gives Arpeggio much room to express itself as something much more than a simple war story, the mental model may seem to translate to a light hearted and subtle theme but Arpeggio is quite serious and even takes darker routes towards its conclusion, but as to why the fog members decided to all pick up female archetypes is still something up for debate.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of Arpeggio\u2019s issues can be traced back to its length, 12 episodes was not enough for it to truly present itself, the result of this is several holes in explanations and lack of enough back story to keep the series standing firm. A very obvious element that the series should definitely have covered was the origins of the fog, because as it stands \u201csudden appearance\u201d is not enough a reason to justify their existence, but as its source material is still ongoing, this might be something we can willingly forgive. The presentation of the fog can also be considered underwhelming, a regiment vast enough to conquer all of earth\u2019s waters should at least number in the ten thousands\u2019, the anime does very little to reflect the fog as the dominant force it should be and unfortunately only concentrates on 9 members, larger numbers would have gone a long way in stating the anime\u2019s intent as something to be taken very seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing to say about the art style is, CG and cute girls were made for each other, haters be damned. As opposed to most CG you see in anime these days, Arpeggio boasts some extremely high quality rendering, the coloring blends well and they hit the brightness level just perfectly and that\u2019s not even counting in the outstanding character designs. The CG actually compliments the world of Arpeggio so well that it\u2019s honestly hard to imagine the series without it. Also given the ease CG gives animators they rightfully \u2018flexed their muscles\u2019, colorful sceneries, radical movements and flamboyant naval combats are all present and executed fluidly. The opening theme \u2018Savior of Song\u2019 by Nano is nothing short of sublime, an absolutely riveting and exciting high beat Pop-rock that highly deserves more than one viewing an episode, the part with character montages striking the most interest. The ending \u2018Blue Field\u2019 by Trident is an ever so alluring slow and somber beat that melded well with the slow animation of its sequence. \\n\\n\r\nThe approach the author did in characterization here was actually presenting characters with several diverse personalities, enough personalities that viewers would undoubtedly find a favorite quite easily. The MC Chihaya Gunzou really impresses when in his Command Center, even though you hold no military knowledge watching the way he assesses situations and gives out orders accordingly with commanding presence makes the naval battles so much more interesting, his leadership skills and tactical know how are one of Arpeggio\u2019s brightest aspects, however outside of his CC he\u2019s kind of a dud. Iona on the other hand has very little to give to the viewer, from start to finish all she does is receive, process and carry out her captain\u2019s orders, her apathic nature although going perfectly with the nature of the series still made her hard to like and the show of \u2018will\u2019 she performs at the end did very little to refute her. The real joy however you\u2019ll find are with the different Girls of the Fog, AI or not, how they chose to present themselves was both alluring and dazzling and their interactions are a joy to watch, most of this will stem from your initial knowledge of how strict the workings of the fog is but seeing how their characters change really brings a great sense of joy for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe vast possibilities Arpeggio could have produced or explored if it wasn\u2019t rushed are nearly endless, however Arpeggio should not be viewed as a simple tale of Man Vs. Machine as it incorporates so much more, it is a battle to find out and discovers one true self and meaning of existence, searching for answers to the all-important questions, how coexistence is an important value and Sentient is more than enough of a reason for us all to live together in peace.",

            "content": "Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova Full Review\r\nI would say that Aoki Hagane is one of those dark horse anime this season. Not many people watched it, maybe because they didn\u2019t like the art style or maybe just the idea behind battleships. So, is this a worthy investment of your time? Let\u2019s take a look!\r\nNote: There will be minor spoilers. \r\nStory (9/10): \r\nThe story of Aoki Hagane is broken up into two parts. First, is the battle between humans and the forces of the Fog. This is basically the universe it is set in, and our hero, Chihaya Gunzou, somehow manages to obtain the powerof one of the Fog\u2019s submarine, Iona 401, which turns the tide of the battle. What\u2019s great about this is that it Gunzou and Iona are sort of the neutral party. Yes, they are fighting against the Fog, but the army is also hostile towards them because they are afraid Gunzou would use Iona\u2019s power against them, or that Iona might go berserk and attack them instead. This brings about a much more interesting storyline and more tension. Imagine the whole world is against you, and just how intense that would be? \\n\\n\r\nSecond part of the story is how members of the Fog with Mental Models develop human characteristics such as emotions, logical thinking and relationships, and these lead to them questioning the basis of their actions. It\u2019s this internal struggle between to do what you\u2019re made to do (as weapons), or to follow your heart\u2019s desire. While the development in this aspect is a little cliche, it\u2019s still an awesome story device that makes the story filled with so much more depth, rather than just battles between ships.\\n\\n\r\nLet me discuss a little about the battles. These battles are one of the most intense and well made scenes I\u2019ve ever seen, and it thoroughly reminds me of Code Geass, such that battles are not won with sheer power and might, but with logic and strategic thinking to outsmart the enemy. Aoki Hagane does this extremely well, immersing the viewers in that amazing experience. If you liked the battles in Code Geass, expect to find the same epicness here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nAoki Hagane is weird such that its supporting characters (with the exception of Iona) get plenty of development. In which case, we see the Mental Models of the fog undergo character developments as they are more exposed to humans. No longer are they just weapons, but more... Human. It is interesting to see how each of them transforms based on different reasons and experiences. The issue here is that some of their transformations, or rather, developments, are not as justified or too sudden.Though, it was really interesting to see these characters interact, because they are not your typical stereotypes such as Tsundere or Kuudere or whatever other deres, as such, their personalities were different.What I would\u2019ve liked to see was perhaps even more development for them. While they did have developments, it felt a little lacking when the story was centered on them. \\n\\n\r\nChihaya Gunzou pretty much remains the same throughout the show. That doesn\u2019t make him bad in anyway, though. He\u2019s an extremely interesting character with the wit of Lelouch and the nobility of the other characters such as Kamijou Touma(putting others before himself).  In other words, you get a character that is smart, witty and puts others before him. What more can you want?\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I have with the characters is perhaps of the other crew members. They have so little screentime and development that I can\u2019t even remember what their names are. What is their purpose of joining Gunzou, or what is their personality like, it\u2019s really hard to tell. It\u2019s as if they were there for the sole purpose of operating Iona 401. However, this is not that big of an issue because it doesn\u2019t really hurt the story that much.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for this anime is amazing. Special credits to nano\u2019s Saviour of Song, the opening for this anime. Not only is it catchy, but every time you listen to it, it is as if you\u2019re ready for a naval battle. The instrumental just fits the anime so well. The ending song, Blue Field, also has that \u201csea feel\u201d if you get what I\u2019m going at.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the instruments played especially during the battle scenes fits it so well. Adding so much more tension that really makes you feel as if you\u2019re in that battle itself.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for this anime is interesting such that it\u2019s done with CGI. As such, you would notice that the characters movements look a bit as though it\u2019s a game. It\u2019s the first time an anime has applied this technique, and I must say it was done quite well. It might put you off at first, but once you get used to it, you\u2019ll notice just how good it actually looks.\\n\\n\r\nThe animations for the battle scenes are especially well done. Throughout the entire scene, the battles flow smoothly. The explosions are especially well done. It can be split into two parts, Corrosion Impact and High Explosive. Both look just as beautiful when they impact the target.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9.5/10)\\n\\n\r\nInitially I dropped this anime because of the art style, but I\u2019m very glad I picked it up again. I absolutely loved Code Geass, as an anime that is not just about battles. Aoki Hagane manages to do the same thing, though not as well as Code Geass (due to lack of episodes) but I\u2019m able to feel that same type of enjoyment. I think I could\u2019ve found a new love for battleships because of this anime... Anyway, every episode is interesting because of the battles and the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI especially enjoyed the opening theme, having always listen to it and sing along just because its that catchy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8.5/10)\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I like Aoki Hagane, from a reviewer\u2019s standpoint, I would have to give it an 8.5/10. Characters could definitely been developed a little bit more. If that was the case, I would defintely give it a 9/10 or even a 10/10. That being said, I still highly recommend Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio; you will not be disappointed.\\n",

            "content": "Note:  this review of Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: ARS Nova contains minor spoilers.  \r\nSo, how did I like the series?  Well, let me take it by parts:\r\nStory:  8/10\r\nThere were both positives and negatives to the story.    \r\nOn the positive side, I felt the story was very entertaining and brought back memories of Space Opera.  Space Opera is one of the genres of anime that I have lamented seeing very little of over the last few years.  It was a staple of the early years of anime, but is almost gone now.  ARS Nova isn\u2019t spaceopera, as it takes place at sea, but it has a similar feel to it (i.e. Outlaw Star).  \\n\\n\r\nThe human race has been isolated due to the \u2018Fleet of Fog\u2019, an enigmatic fleet of battleships with awesome weapons that wiped out the human naval forces seven years ago and then\u2026 nothing.  So, who are the crew of the Fleet of Fog?  What type of eerie alien creatures inhabit the ships?  Or, since this is an anime, what type of uber-beautiful humanoids females crew the ships?  As it turns out, there are no crew, as the ships are sentient.  Aww, so no pretty girls \uf04c.  Not to worry, the ships sentience can manifest themselves into \u2018Mental Models\u2019 that, of course, are uber-beautiful females.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I liked is how the story slowly morphed into a Harem without it really affecting the base story.  Yes, there was the ubiquitous beach scene, and yes, there were several girls liking the main character.  But at least he\u2019s a cool main character.\\n\\n\r\nThere were a few negatives to the story, however.  First, the idea of alien beings taking the form of humans and then essentially being reprogrammed by those pesky human emotions is not an original idea.  While I won\u2019t state that it is a rip-off of the underlying theme of Robotech, it is still the exact same premise.  The second issue I had with the story is the lack of a back-story.  I think there was about 5 minutes of the was seven years prior.  Where did the Fog come from, how did the rest of the crew get onboard 401, and what actually happened after Hyuuga was sank, just to name a few.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Visuals \u2013 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the art and visuals is one of the best things about the whole series.  Yes, yes, I know all the naysayers out there who\u2019ve complained about the CG aspect of the ships.  I do not agree.  The CG, as it was used only for the ships, was a major enhancer to the series, rather than a detractor.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 7/10\\n\\n\r\nQuite possibly the least favorable part of the series was the soundtrack.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, the opening, \u201cSavior of Song\", is performed by Nano and is quite good.  The endings, as well as the score during the battles scenes are also are also good.  However, the remainder of the series had very minimal sound accompaniment, which is quite possibly the only detractor in the series for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWith a few exception, the character development was quite good for the series.  The main character and the fog girls were detailed pretty meticulously, which is something that I appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nI like strong, unpredictable main characters.  Gunzou Chihaya was the perfect captain for the 401.  He\u2019s unpredictable, doesn\u2019t say much, but is always is one step ahead of the enemy.   While he is no Marko Ramius (Hunt For Red October) when it comes to submarine battles, he was able to use unpredictable tactics, like the remote launchers to keep defeating the Fog ships.  His style and his composure brought me glimpses of David Weber\u2019s Honor Harrington.\\n\\n\r\nI had an issue with some of his crew, however.  What\u2019s the deal with mask-man?  If they\u2019re going to do a mask, at least make it aesthetically pleasing.  He looked like Abe the fish-man from Hellboy.  I did hear one subtle mention about allergies, but I don\u2019t buy it.  The rest of the crew were OK (the engine room girl (don\u2019t know her name) is quite possibly the cutest girl in the whole series) and the black guy with the pony-tail was also really cool.\\n\\n\r\nI did like the Fog girls.  Iona is just so darn cute.  I personally like small girls, and she fit the bill nicely.  None of the girls had big knockers, which would have been a real detractor in my mind.  Takeo is funny and cute, but Kirishima seemed to be cut from the same cloth as her, which is most likely why they kept her as a teddy bear.  However, the true jewel, of course, was Haruna.  While not the prettiest face, and her coat is a sick joke, but outside of the coat, she is hot.  Maya was adorable, and I actually liked Kongou \u2013 brought back memories of another alien who nearly went insane from emotions:  Khyron.  Somewhat ambivalent about Hyuuga, then again, I personally don\u2019t really see a need for a yuri aspect.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the series, and it is currently the best series of the season for me.  Of course I still have a few more to go.  The battle scenes were good, almost reminiscent of Hunt for Red October mixed with an Outlaw Star type of Space Opera, and the non battle scenes were not filler.  They were actually useful to move the series along.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this a 9/10, and I definitely hope that there will be a second season.",

            "content": "Ars Nova is a pathetic, delusional, self-insert fantasy written by and for people who would be much better off aiming low. Here's the story line from a similar series: an ugly, boring, stinking gamer finds himself no longer having to concern himself with the tedious things in life (such as bathing) and is forced to spend every second of every day playing a computer game. In so doing he becomes everyone's hero and gets all the chicks. Like that series, whilst watching Ars Nova you are expected to supplant your own boring and probably depressing existence with the lead character's. Gunzou Chihaya is a skinnyand completely uninteresting teenage boy who finds himself as the only human being able to control an alien battleship that for some reason is also a (barely pubescent) hot chick. This gives him the power to defy all authority and basically do whatever he wants. What he wishes to do is become a hero of all the girls who dry-wretched at his odour back in highschool, so he goes off to fight the armada of alien battleships that is currently attacking Earth. It is of no surprise that each of these ships is also a hot chick, some being unable to resist him. \\n\\n\r\nThere is little point discussing details such as animation quality and sound because the basic premise of someone like that being given that kind of power and acting in that sort of way is so absurd that it is hard to watch without wanting to defenestrate your TV. And everything is geared towards selling this fap. The alien ships have artificial intelligence and are designed to function on their own, yet they want him as their captain to order them around. And there's even a crew added to his ship whose only purpose is to gasp at his courage, be awed by his tactical genius, and basically boost him up to being some kind of Captain fucking Stupendous. And this is all done without him doing a single thing even remotely interesting or likeable, let alone endearing to the point of obsession. \\n\\n\r\nAoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova seems to be nothing more than a loser's desperate wish to gain admiration and respect. Rather than shows like this, maybe you should try starting with soap.",

Not so many Action, Sci-Fi anime can be good without using those things but this anime just made it possible. However, this anime is too underrated than it actually is.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nStory of the world in 2039 where all the sea transportation has been blocked out by a group of mysterious warships called \"Fleet of Fog\" which has more advanced technology than mankind's and ended mankind's long last history of involvement with the seas.\r\nThe story seems a bit too much of fantasyand too unreasonable. However, there is only a few flaws other than this one. The way the story takes it's pace is very good. And Filled with warm-heart scenes which presents moral.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe first thing that impressed me when I first watched this anime is it's art. Superb graphic and animations. New-generation graphic of rendering character's animations was used in this anime which still imperfect but it's really shows the contrast of how better it is between old-generation and the new one. The background and the effects also very good, as well as how they adjust the light and flares effects. And I'm impressed by the camera angle and composition adjusting of this anime which be able to show the meanings and stories out of it. Not just the sound and the context shows the story but the camera angle and scenes compositioning as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nYes, this anime got music composer from the DMC series. Made out perfect soundtracks. Made almost all the scenes more emotional. As well as the opening theme, ending theme and inserted songs by Nano which absolutely perfect. I really love the song \"Silver Sky\", the violin sounds really nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nVery good characters design and planning. All of them looks nice and implementing with the new-generation graphics, it's perfect. Characters' personality and acting is good. Each characters has quiet a unique personality  and decision which makes them unique as an individual.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThis series way of presenting is really enjoyable. Filled with Action, conducted by Fantasy which based on Sci-Fi, a bit taste of Romance and presented in Seinen way. Nice combination. Moreover, this series presented lots of naval tactics which really made me enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is a great series. I pretty much understand why it is underrated by the community. Different of individual taste and enjoyment made it hard for this kind of best-of-nothing-but-good-at-everything anime for getting high scores. But for me, I really recommend this anime. I really enjoyed it and I hope you can enjoy it as well. :)",

Another thing I loved is that this has the set up to be a harem (1 guy, tons of powerful, attractive girls) but doesn't turn into one. There's only 1 love triangle and all the other mental model girls have their own motivations.  The mental model characters are fleshed out very well and think is one of the best female supporting casts I've seen. Iona is probably the best character, with all of the ship mental models following closely second.  \r\nOn the downside,the actual human cast is rather one dimensional. I don't understand everyone's fascination with the MC Gunzo, except Iona.  This is probably due to only having half a season, but that doesn't excuse it.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, you have to give this the 3 episode test, because it really doesn't hook until ep 3, IMO.\\n",

            "content": "I know, I know, I fricking know... This review is WAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY overdue but hey, as per the good 'ole saying, better late than never now, right? RIGHT!? \r\nAlright so... Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova, or just Ars Nova for short is basically an \"Annihilate the ultra-malicious sentient A.I while politicking and surviving at the same time\" story revolving around a small group of naval cadets who came into contact with one of the 'sentient A.I', went A.W.O.L., sailed off into the horizon in their souped-up alien sub, torpedoing enemy ships into the deep depths and basically gathering more intel throughout their mission. \r\nIf thatkinda story doesn't make you go \"OH MAI GADD, that is SOOOO what-EVVAR\", and that it excites you as you see things 'blow up', then this might just wanna make you shout out into the dark sky DEMANDING more.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, the story's premise is actually pretty interesting to those who fancy these kinda stories, though I must admit that premises such as these are getting increasingly saturated in fictional media. Nevertheless, what manages to salvage this particular one from being \"just another one a' those\" stories is in the manner it actually keeps steady the element of mystery surrounding the sentient A.Is' origins and motives for their mass invasion of Earth. The steady introduction of plot elements that explore the nuances of the sentient nature of the A.Is, the political landscape of the remaining human survivors, as well as the goals of the primary protagonist allows depth in the storytelling, which would be lost if the story was just about BOOM-BOOM-KABOOM-BOOMs 24/7, ala. Michael Bay.\\n\\n\r\nBut, there are a few misconducts here and there, in particular the lack of exploration in the primary protagonist's back story (which was implied and stated to carry great significance in the plot), as well as the utilizing of some rather odd (read: 'tropey') directions in the development of the sentient A.I characters' personalities, and a very debatable Deus ex Machina scene as the series nears its end.\\n\\n\r\nStory Rating: 8\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nArtistically speaking, this series is a stunner. Buuuut, it might just not appeal to everyone due to its use of 3D-CGI graphics as its main animation style. The series bleeds with rich, vibrant and vivid coloring at almost all points throughout its run time and the 3D animation frame rate doesn't experience any considerable, or noticeable drops. Also, the sheer detail put into the backgrounds, the naval war vessels, the numerous action scenes, the opening and ending sequences, character design variety, ship transformation sequences and so on and so forth is astounding! But best of all, for an anime that greatly utilizes water as the primary background setting for much of its course, the depiction of water in this anime is a downright pleasure to look at, as it just leaves one in a state of awe and admiration at times. \\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, very few to zero animation hick-ups or inconsistencies. So rest easy on that.\\n\\n\r\nArt Rating: 10\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nIf the art and animation themselves are great enough, then the sound-based aspects of this show are equally as great, for they are nothing short of meticulous and very well-produced. The sound effects are truly a pleasure to listen to, highly nuanced, and very accurate to what actually happens -or might happen- when the conditions are right and the chances for occurrence are high.\\n\\n\r\nNotwithstanding that, even the voice acting in this show is definitely up to par, especially with the show's main A.I antagonist, the primary protagonist, and several of the side characters. The VAs really bring forth the life and personality of each character and no scene felt stale, amateurish or over/under-acted. One particular standout scene appears as the series nears its end, though figuring out which scene that was is up to you to watch the show till its conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nSound Rating: 10\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nRiiiight... Even though the VAs really breathe life and personality into their roles, unfortunately the characters themselves are rather lacking, as many of them -in particular the sentient A.I characters- are based off well-worn tropes in the Japanese anime/manga/gaming spectrum. The main A.I antagonist gets more complex character development later on, but the conclusion to that antagonist's character development is rather stale and standard, unfortunately. Despite all that though, there were several scenes that show the willingness of these characters to become more serious as the situation arises accordingly, even though their motives during such situations are still very tropey in nature. Overall, this is easily the weakest part of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Rating: 6\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nFrankly, I enjoyed the heck outta this series. Not only is it intellectually stimulating at times due to the addition of political and philosophical elements, it also excites the more militaristic and battle-oriented side of me as I just simply love to get to know more, or see anything related to the military get referenced in a piece of fiction. Action scenes are everywhere, but nowhere are they gratuitous, as the battles that take place in this story actually impact the story line and help steer it towards its conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nAnd ah yes, THAT OPENING THEME! Easily ONE OF THE MOST EPIC ones that I've seen last year. Woah, just woah. Greatly excites me anytime of the day, save for when I'm really, really down in the dumps.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment Rating: 9\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nHah, should I recommend you this? Why, OF COURSE! But, then again, it really does depend on whether you actually like these kinds of stories, and that yes, the tropeyness of some of the characters really does leave one with second thoughts on whether this thing is really something that one can dedicate time to.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, the final verdict:\\n\\n\r\n[9 For Personal Rating]\\n\\n\r\nAnd\\n\\n\r\n[8 For Critical Rating]\\n\\n\r\nI bid all of you farewell, till next time then.",

            "content": "Three words, Harem Battleship Fleet.  \r\nThat is all I have to say about this anime.  \r\nReview done (But not really...)\r\nSpoiler alerts\r\nStory: 6\r\nIn a world where sea travel and communication does no't exist because of a strange fleet called \"The Fog\", we follow a captain, Gunzou, and his crew which includes teenagers and a loli submarine.   This loli submarine turns out to be Iona, a member of \"The Fog\" who was given orders to obey Gunzou.  The combination of a great submarine and a great captain, the crew overcomes their obstacles, make new allies, as well as new enemies.  \r\nThepacing was fine, a few spots, especially prior to an action scene, were fast paced.  They always seemed to want to head straight into the action, but this is where they excelled, which I will explain more about in the art section.  \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem I had with this story was the fact that nothing was carried through all the way.  What seemed to almost start a political war was quickly ignored by action.  What was about to be an answer to questions that we may never get an answer too (possibly if there is a season two?).  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nCG art is starting to pick up in anime, and it has it's ups and downs.  Outside of action scenes, the CG art looked great!  I had no problem with the way the series looked, but then things started getting animated, and it the movement looked so forced.  Things such as hair, hands, arms, legs, all moved awkwardly.\\n\\n\r\nAction scenes on the other hand were amazing, the CG art promoted the sci-fi feel of the anime as well as the animation looking more smooth and not as awkward.  The final fight blew me away, the art was amazing to look at and the way it was animated... eyegasm.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs were great, enjoyed the designs of all the characters.  The only complaint on character designs were to make I-400 and I-402 a more unique.  Their designs were already based on Iona, since they are sisters, but they only added few unique things and the colors they chose for both of them, a pale green and a pale purple, weren't too distinguishing.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nThe OP, Savior of Song, is a rock techno mix that works well with the anime, since it is an action sci-fi series.  For some reason though, this OP wasn't my cup of tea and didn't really stick in my head like most OPs do.  The anime had four EDs, one being the OP, and the other three being Blue Field, Innocent Blue and Our Story.  The EDs weren't that bad, I didn't mind listening to them, but not that amazing either.  An average OP and average EDs.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music was few and between, and I wished they had used it more, as it would have helped set the moods at times.  The times they had background music, it was used really well, if they had more, i'm sure they would have done a great job with that as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nOutside of the Fog characters and the main character, all the other characters didn't have enough depth to make the memorable.  Who was the one Japanese politician?  Who was the engineer of the ship?  Names easily forgotten on characters that seemed more important than just a side character.  The Fog characters were amazing, and I wish I could see more of them.  More Haruna, more Hyuga, just MORE FOG PLEASE.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was nice, since it was a primary theme of this anime.  Seeing the captain, Iona and the other Fog ships develop was nice to see.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10+\\n\r\nEven though the subcategories scored low, this anime was very enjoyable to watch.  The action scenes were great, and the characters that were the main character and Fog were very enjoyable.  Seeing awesome female characters is a plus as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThe enjoyment I got from this anime was so high, that this anime is my favorite of the fall season.  Hope there will be more.\\n",

            "content": "I have just finished watching this anime, and for the first time I feel motivated to actually write down my thoughts on it.\r\nAoki Hagane is a good anime. It looks really nice (in my opinion, although I know that the CG style is not everyone's favourite, it's easy on the eyes and I personally enjoy the art quite a lot) and it has plenty of amazing moments (no spoilers, of course).\r\nI won't write a detailed summary of the story, but I will say that the story line of Aoki Hagane is not exactly new - mysterious non-human battleships overpowering all of mankind, except for ChihayaGunzou and the rest of the crew of the Fog submarine I-401, Iona, who are attempting to cross the Pacific in one last attempt to save humanity. It's not a huge leap from, to name an anime at random, Strike Witches, especially with the common idea of certain individuals of the Fog joining the heroes.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual story itself is fairly simple, but generally remains sensible and within the bounds of its own rules (outside of a few plot holes which only arise in hindsight). Instead, the anime tends to focus more on the Fog and their interactions. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as the Fog (the 'mental models' of the enemy warships) are interesting enough characters by themselves. Even so, the ships are quite obviously the main characters of the anime, bar a handful of episodes which show the human politics which are going on in the background.\\n\\n\r\nBy and large, however, the humans - and most noticeably, Iona's crew - take a backseat to the other characters. We are barely given a few seconds in the first episode which hint that Gunzou may actually have a backstory, but not even the slightest attempt is made to explore this - and even less so for the other members of his crew, most of whom have less lines than a certain teddy bear. This is a shame, because initially I had the impression that Aoki Hagane was going to be an anime about Gunzou rebelling against the government as much as it was about fighting the Fog.\\n\\n\r\nPutting aside the fact that Gunzou and his crew have badly (if at all) explained motivation for their part in the story, I feel that Aoki Hagane does a good job of building those characters which it chooses to build. The ships are distinctive and it's interesting to watch their characters grow over the course of their dialogues.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in summary: Aoki Hagane is a very good anime, that gives a new meaning to the phrase 'nice boat'. There are many things which it does well, as well as things that it does not do so well. Personally, I find this anime is very enjoyable in spite of the main drawback (which is the lack of character building for any of the human characters), but I can see how it would simply be far too irritating to have so many unanswered questions. So, I will give this anime a tentative 8, because I feel that what it does do is done very well.",

            "content": "Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova was one of the most underrated anime of the Fall 2013 season. This anime aired at the same time as the popular anime from this season such as Kill la Kill, Log Horizon, Beyond the Boundary, Magi, Nagi no Asakura, Kuroko no Basuke, Non Non Biyori, etc. \r\nStory:\r\nThe storyline seems to be confusing at first, but as you get to episode four, it\u2019s easier to comprehend. You\u2019ll understand the purpose of \u201cthe Fleet\u201d and their origins as well. Since this anime aired before KanColle, the concept of female characters controlling a warship was unique. All of the members of\u201cthe Fleet\u201d are female, so this anime turns into an \u201cunconventional harem\u201d. In other words, there were more female characters than male characters, but not all of the girls were in love with the MC- Gunzou Chihaya. Anyhow, the story followed the basic plot diagram with one major plot twist. \\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nDon\u2019t underestimate the CGI animation or the \u201ctongue-twisting\u201d title of the anime. The animation was distinct from the other anime that aired in the 2013 fall season. The CGI animation gave me the vibe from those cut scenes from Fire Emblem: Awakening. In fact, from all cut scenes of video games I\u2019ve played in the past. Also, the CGI elements form gave me a nostalgic feeling from another TV show that used the same animation style. I can\u2019t recall the name of the show, though. \\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe theme song was one of the best things to come out of the series. As for the sound, it was pretty sharp which reminded me of other sci-fi movies I\u2019ve watched in the past. The voice acting was great too, each role was proper.\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe series had interesting and memorable characters. Each character had unique personalities and appearances. It didn\u2019t make me feel like I was watching a character that looks similar to another character from a different series I\u2019ve watched. Also, each key character had their spotlight, so no one was left out. The top 5 Character of the series were: \\n\r\n1. Iona/I-401: A combination of Kanade from Angel Beats and Shiro from No Game No Life. One of the most underrated Kuudere girls out there.\\n\r\n2. Takao: She shares a similar resemblance to Hatsune Miku, I\u2019m not kidding. When I first saw her, the first character that came to mind was Miku. The only difference is the tone of their hair color. Anyways, she\u2019s a well-developed and well-designed character, and she does something that will make you love her.\\n\r\n3. Haruna: The third best girl of the series. She\u2019s cute when someone takes her coat off and when she puts it on. Shazam\u2026.\\n\r\n4. Gunzou Chihaya: He has that mature personality that is suiting for a captain of the ship. His character design is great as well.\\n\r\n5. Hyuuga and Kirishima (Tie): Can\u2019t say much about these two other than being great comic relief characters. They\u2019re memorable characters that played their part.\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Colorful characters\\n\r\n-Sharp Sound\\n\r\n-Unique Animation Style\\n\r\n-Simple Plot\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Lackluster villains: The series needed better villains other than one that was easy to beat.\\n\r\n-Misleading title: Try saying the title 10 times without messing up. \\n\r\nClosing Statement: \\n\r\nThis anime was a Secret Santa gift from \u201cfillyy\", so thank you for recommending me this anime. Also, this anime was the last anime I watched in 2015.",

Se ele j\u00e1 \u00e9 um anime magn\u00edfico por si s\u00f3 Hagane \u00e9 o tipo de anime que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o d\u00e1 nada, por tratar-se de embarca\u00e7\u00f5es/submarinos. Por\u00e9m, ele tem um diferencial. Al\u00e9m das embarca\u00e7\u00f5es terem \u201csentimentos\u201d e meio que serem \u201cpessoas\u201d, ele aborda uma tem\u00e1tica, bastante peculiar. O anime em si, passa-se no futuro. Quase n\u00e3o existindo mais terra, superf\u00edcie. Ent\u00e3o, as for\u00e7as armadas de maior poder, \u00e9 a marinha. O personagem principal, como capit\u00e3o de sua tripula\u00e7\u00e3o. Realiza certos servi\u00e7os, para a marinha, e o anime, vai desenrolando-se basicamente nisso. Mas, por qu\u00ea, Hagane consegue ser t\u00e3o bom? Primeiro:o personagem principal, \u00e9 um g\u00eanio estrategista. E personagens do tipo \u201cinteligentes\u201d sempre s\u00e3o bem vistos. Segundo: o anime se baseia em um futuro meio que p\u00f3s apocal\u00edptico, com um toque de Seinen e Cyber-punk. Para os que adoram t\u00e3o tema, ir\u00e3o amar. Terceiro: a hist\u00f3ria que o anime apresenta, \u00e9 boa, ent\u00e3o n\u00e3o h\u00e1 tanto o que reclamar. E quarto: o anime traz algo inovador, que \u00e9 as batalhas de submarinos, baseadas em estrat\u00e9gias e tudo mais. E, \u00e9 por isso que Hagane consegue ser t\u00e3o bom.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat to talk about Aoki Hagane? If it is already a magnificent anime by itself Hagane is the kind of anime that you give nothing, because it is about boats / submarines. However, it has a differential. In addition to the vessels having \"feelings\" and kind of being \"people\", it tackles a very peculiar theme. The anime itself, happens in the future. Almost no more earth, surface. So the most powerful military is the navy. The main character, as captain of his crew. It performs certain services, for the navy, and the anime, it goes basically unfolding in this. But why, Hagane can be so good? First: the main character, is a genius strategist. And \"smart\" characters are always well-regarded. Second: the anime is based on a future post apocalyptic medium, with a touch of Seinen and Cyber-punk. For those who love such a theme, they will love. Third: the story that the anime presents, is good, so there is so much to complain about. And fourth: the anime brings something innovative, which is the submarine battles, based on strategies and everything. And that's why Hagane manages to be so good.",

            "content": "Overall opinion: It's an ok anime, it could have been much better.\r\nStory 6/10 I'm quite disappointed regarding the storyline of this anime. Although the storyline isn't terrible, it doesn't progress much and there are some things that should have been included in it. So the anime is pretty much about a boy commanding a submarine and a few warships and defeating a group of enemy ships known as the 'Fog Fleet' that have been attacking human ships. One of the things that really should have been included in the anime is the origins of the fog fleet. The only things we really know about thefog fleet are that they are pretty much a group of super warships armed with weapons that surpass human technology that aim to destroy human ships at sea and the fact that they are given orders from an unknown authority that controls them. Other 'holes' in the storyline include what happens to maya after kongo is defeated and even more important, the fate of the fog fleet. Do they eventually come under the control of Gunzo or do they all get destroyed, wiping out their threat? Regarding Maya after Kongo absorbed her, how come she doesn't reappear after Kongo's defeat from Iona? Furthermore, we don't even see Gunzo successfully delivering the torpedo that has the potential to defeat the fog fleet to USA. The storyline is quite shallow and it lacks some important things, lowering the score down.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10  The animation in arpeggio of blue steel is outstanding. CGI effects during the battles are especially stunning. It looks boss when the lasers and missiles explode or hit on impact. Character design is also excellent.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10 The sound track is great in the anime. The opening song suits this anime very well. The sound for the battles is also done well and it mixes well with the stunning animation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10 I don't really like the characters much in this anime. Most of the time, the characters are really one-dimensional and you don't see much about them because they don't spend much time on the screen. Another thing I find doesn't make much sense is why the characters (except Iona) choose to follow Gunzo instead of staying with the fog fleet. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10 Arpeggio of blue steel is a reasonably good anime if you like anime that has superb animation and sound mixed with battle scenes for more interest although it could have been better had it been longer so that there would be more development.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation: Would recommend it, however not as a must-watch anime.",

            "content": "Going to try to write this one in paragraphs instead of the separated categories like I usually do, those who find those sort of reviews more helpful ill leave a version of that review on the bottom\r\n===========================================\r\nReview for Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio : Ars Nova (Arpeggio Blue Steel)\r\n===========================================\r\nAt the beginning I personally was not used to the mix of the 3D animation and  sort of 2D backgrounds and sort of thought the character's movements were very stiff. Though as watch more this will bother you less and less till the point you don't notice anything wrong with it. The Main characters have been developedwell, the supporting cast is really strong and may as well be mains. \\n\\n\r\nAn anime that at first glance may seem like it would become a harem but it doesn't and though this may seem disappointing for some it actually develops quite nicely all the characters have their reasons for their actions and they are'nt all after our protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound has been done well all the voice acting is great, the sound effects for all the naval battles meet 'quality standards' as to say, I'm sure you would have heard them elsewhere. \\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed the anime and personally feel there is room for a season 2 but the season closed in a way where it is not needed, Looking forward to the movie.\\n\\n\r\n=============================================\\n\r\nReview done in my usual category type: (for those who prefer it that way)\\n\\n\r\nStory : The story played out in this anime may not be unique but it has been executed very well, Lots of ups and downs and very little down time from the action. So if your looking for advance tech naval strategies this is the anime for you. \\n\\n\r\nArt : The art style is essentially 3D Characters, 3D Ships, 2D backgrounds (it seems to be I'm quite sure it is). The 3D characters threw me off a bit during the first episode as the characters movements seemed stiff and not fluent. Though its like they changed artists after the first episode and the art feels better after the first episode. 3D ships well personally I feel this may be the only way to get some really cool naval battle action and its very well done. \\n\r\nIndoors and basically when they are not on the ship the backgrounds are 2D the characters may seem 2D during these scenes as well. Messy start but works well as you continue to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSound : Great voice acting, Good sound effects. The sounds reach 'quality standards' as per say. Done really well I'm sure you heard some of the effects used in other things. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters : The Main characters have been developed well and the supporting cast is also quite developed and strong, They may as well all be main characters in this. Happy to say there is only one love triangle and the other girls have their own reasons for their actions. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : Personally enjoyed watching our protagonists solve problems and how all the naval action is done, The story was enjoyable to watch and I'm looking forward to watching the upcoming movie.",

            "content": "Before deciding if you should watch Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova, you should probably ask yourself if military science fiction is your type of anime. Military science fiction often takes the idea of military but also fuses it with supernatural themes with flavors of science and artificial warfare. There are a lot of ideas that plays around with military sci-fi including alien invasions, mecha, or space wars. So what happens when you take a bunch of mental models that resembles the characteristics of female characters and puts them into total warfare? Simple. You get Arpeggio of Blue Steel: Arsa Nova.\r\nThe series itself is basedoff of the manga of the same name written by Ark Performance. The premise sets takes place in a setting of an alternate history although there are many similar paths crossed. For one, that path involves the Japanese attempting to recover their nation through engaging trades. Unfortunately, its enemy forces have powerful weapons of war known as the \u201cFleet of the Flog\u201d. These are essentially weapons that has turned the tides in battle and pushed back its adversaries to the brink of despair. Luckily, there is some hope because of a certain naval group that is capable of dealing with this threat. They are called the Blue Steel and this series chronicles their journey.\\n\\n\r\nArpeggio of Blue Steel might be a series that people would sway their heads away at first. The idea is hardly original as demonstrated in previous sci-fi war theme series such as Strike Witches, Tactical Roar, Blue Submarine No. 6, and Full Metal Panic. Potential viewers for the series might also sway their heads away as lead director Seiji Kishi is in charge of this adaptation. His mediocre direction of recent anime series based on adaptations such as Devil Survivor 2: The Animation and Persona 4 had numerous problems. Therefore, this show might initially be met with some controversy. For me, the series has its ups and downs. To call it a scientific masterpiece would be over exaggerating but it\u2019s also not a waste of time to watch either. Because of its premise, this show itself does set itself differently with its cast of characters and brings the military science fiction theme in a different light.\\n\\n\r\nTaking place in the future of 2056, technology has far advanced than our modern world. Just imagine in over 40 years what our world would be like. For the characters in this series, they\u2019re not living at home relaxing but are on the war zone to carry out an important mission. That mission is no walk in the park because of the obstacles ahead. Taken from an objective standards, the obstacles comes into two forms. The most obvious involves the \u2018Fleet of Fog\u2019, fictional avatars named after non-fictional battleships. The other obstacle involves also dealing with humans and corrupt governments that wants to achieve various goals with their own deeds. It\u2019s a bloody revolution and no one wants to play nice.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters from this series includes the captain of the Blue Steel, Chihaya Gonzou. He can be described as a serious man with tactical mind of a leader with the ability to lead his crew through obstacles. However, he can\u2019t do this alone without the help of his crew members. Among this group is a prominent avatar with code name 104 that also goes by the name \u201cIona\u201d. Throughout the series, she describes herself as a weapon born to fight with no other purpose. Ever since she joined the human side, the government and various factions has their eyes set on her. Iona can be easily described as a giant killer. She may be have a small body structure but Iona\u2019s abilities shines in battle many times thanks to her initiate ability to eradicate emotions and fight. This is proven early on when the crew takes on Takao, another human avatar of a Fog cruiser. Unfortunately, there\u2019s hardly anything we can bring out from Iona. She\u2019s a character that is surrounded in mystery with her stoic behavior. Her relationship with Gonzou and the crew can be described as professional although throughout the series, she questions herself exactly who or what she is.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that also brings another point. The concept of more human behaviors.\\n\\n\r\nLater on in the series, other Fog Ships are introduced that becomes a threatening factor to Blue Steel. Their purpose is set on destroying the privateers. However, it\u2019s noticeable that they later on question their own purpose. This doesn\u2019t just include Iona but also other Fog ships especially after they encounter a human girl. The encounter brings out a variety of human behavior including responsibility, guardianship, and even friendship. It\u2019s questionable whether the characters in this series can truly establish a bond between Fog Ships and humans. Humans seems to fear Fog Battleships while the latter seems to despise humans for weaknesses. On the other hand, some of them clearly demonstrates human behavior ranging from love, care, jealousy, and even betrayal. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself follows the premise well with its journey but does derive from the manga quite a bit with certain omitted scenes. It cuts out parts with this adaptation involving some of the comedic dialogues/scenes. Most importantly though is perhaps character development during the journey that is minimized in this series. Being a one-cour show, this anime suffers problems with rushing. Therefore, expect certain factors that might not match up in the end. There\u2019s also a lack of exploration in terms of characters\u2019 backgrounds. Most of them are vaguely expressed by whom they are presently. The lack of background histories can become a problem as viewers might have more questions with no concrete answers. The main protagonists (crews of the Blue Steel) are also difficult to get attached because they hardly get any development. In fact, most of the Fog ships gets more development than Gonzou and his crew which is a down factor for Blue Steel. However, one certain main character also has a highlight purpose because of who she is. In fact, it brings out the human vs Fog ships\u2019 personality that tests new boundaries of these artificial weapons of war. For the Fog ships, some of them learns from these behaviors and demonstrates their own ideologies. \\n\\n\r\nAction wise, the series makes sense although the CGI might take awhile to get used to. As the series takes mostly in a naval environment, most of the battle takes place at sea. The battleships themselves are modeled after real life naval ships. Hence, they are designed with devastating firepower that proves itself in battle. Most of the Fog ships possesses different personalities that reflects their designs. The weapons used throughout the series often includes missiles, force shields and wave motion cannons that clearly outshines our modern world\u2019s technology. The spectacular results of these weapons bring can be pleasing to the eye especially when the Fog ships themselves becomes what they are designed for - annihilation. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is also comedy present throughout the series whether it\u2019s obsessive love, yuri-like fantasies, or the awkwardness in the form of a stuffed animal. Some dialogues are also mixed with words that can bring out laughter with its implications of suggestive factors involving \u201cengines\u201d and little misunderstandings. \\n\\n\r\nWhat isn\u2019t pleasing though should again be addressed to the overall adaptation. The way it is constructed omits very important details involving Gonzou. The lack of exploration involving his parents or past is a serious drawback that is hard to redeem itself. Most characters from the original Blue Steel barely get any of their own spotlights. It turns out that Iona would be the ace despite her soulless personality. But without a clear background or exploration of her past, Iona also becomes a poorly constructed character. It\u2019s a shame that our main characters just doesn\u2019t shine as much as one would hope...\\n\\n\r\nJudging by art standards, Arpeggio of Blue Steel matches well by science fiction means. The way most of the characters are designed given them an impression that they are weapons of war (Fog Ships) or humans whom stands up against what comes at them. (Blue Steel) The animation studio SANZIGEN is not well known though in the anime industry. They are known for only a few science fiction theme series including 009: RE: Cyborg and Black Rock Shooter; the latter that received very mixed reactions. Fortunately, the background of the series redeems itself with glorious naval features, explosive battles, and science fiction aesthetics. The drawback would be the CGI that makes the show itself less powerful with its computer generated graphics. There\u2019s also some fan service usually featuring the Fog Ships that might generate some reactions of eye rolling especially with the way camera angles are pointed at.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is pretty well done by OST standards. Most battle scenes are accompanied with a dynamic beat and dominant intensity. It brings out the intense environment that exists in this alternate historical world. The OP song \u201cSavior of Song\u201d is well performed by Nano (Btooom!, Phi Brain: Puzzle of God 2, Ark IX) with vibrations of energy. The ED song on the other hand provides feedback of a more calm atmosphere similar to some of the comedic scenes in the series. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this show can be a mixed bag depending on your experience with science fiction anime. The idea of a scientific mission sounds engaging but the plot itself is unimpressive as result of its poor adaptation. This is mentioned before because the way it cuts itself out that omits several important factors. It destroys the development of our main characters and where they came from. However, there are themes that are explored that can be interesting to take note of. The problem might be that the answer is for viewers to decide in the end with its ambiguous nature. Luckily, the action, powerful OST, and comedy will definitely leave you with impressions. Some characters (especially the Fog ships) do get development so expect moments where you\u2019ll get to like them more. The fact remains ultimately is that military science fiction anime can take different turns and angles. For Arppegio of Blue Steel, it steered in a path that defines warfare in its own way.\\n",

            "content": "In the year 2039, the combined naval forces of humanity suffer a crushing defeat at the hands of a military force with weapons technology that far surpasses their own. The fearsome assailants? A group of heavy warships, termed \u201cThe Fleet of Fog,\u201d who are commanded by \u201cmental models,\u201d robot-like representations of the minds of the battleships that take the physical form of little girls dressed in frilly clothing. Fast-forward seventeen years, and one of these mental models, named Iona, approaches a human naval cadet named Gunzou out of the blue, offering herself (and, by extension, the advanced Fog submarine she represents) to Gunzou to command.Gunzou accepts the offer, and embarks on a mission, piloting the Fog submarine to defend humanity using the very weapons that almost brought about its end. Meanwhile, Iona and several of the other Fog mental models appear to be warming up to Gunzou and developing emotions, which mental models are not supposed to possess. It's almost impossible to not note that this entire premise seems like a very elaborate way of creating a scenario in which scantily-clad girls say things along the lines of \u201cyou're my captain, please pilot me.\u201d Judging a book by its cover is, of course, wrong, but having thought about Arpeggio of Blue Steel for longer than I ever really wanted to, I don't feel too bad about saying that that initial impression was ultimately pretty close to the money.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps fitting for a story that's partially about machines coming to terms with life, the world of Arpeggio seems to be constructed from the ground up using pure CGI. Everything about it, from characters to ships, bears the obvious stamp of computer generation, and this, unfortunately, is CG of a cheap-looking and ugly breed. If there's one thing the show consistently gets right, it's light\u2014explosions, lasers, computer displays and the like look good more often than not, but that's about the only visual aspect that I can genuinely compliment, and I'm reaching pretty far for that one. Backgrounds and other such niceties don't look so nice, with the ocean in particular often being rendered as a noxious purple-black cloud which bears shockingly little resemblance to a body of water. The design and color choices are poor\u2014the characters all have the same pale, waxy complexion and widely spaced eyes. Add some otherworldly hair and wardrobe malfunctions, and everyone starts to look pretty ridiculous. Add some extraordinarily stiff animation (all characters move with an awkward, jerking hobble, all ships move at a stuttering crawl), and, frankly, you'd be hard-pressed to tell who is supposed to be a human and who is supposed to be a member of the more robotic Fog; they all look equally like paste-colored marionettes. This condition is only worsened by the show's repeated attempts to force its decidedly mechanical characters to do something sexy; it's like watching aliens awkwardly attempt to imitate aspects of human sex appeal, and something about it is strangely disquieting. The core of the show's aesthetic is thoroughly repulsive to no real artistic or thematic end.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, mostly a mix of cheesy techno and uninspired string/horn compositions that seem tailored to fit the seafaring nature of the series, soars to mediocre heights. Okay, cheesy techno aside, some of it actually isn't too bad, but variety is an issue; this is one of those shows that have two or three songs for battle, two or three songs for dramatic moments, and a few minutes' worth of atmospheric noises that get recycled over and over again. The music direction is sub-par, with tracks often starting too late to have any impact on a given scene, or starting too early and overriding dialogue. Sound certainly isn't the show's worst department\u2014actually, by simple process of elimination, it might be the best\u2014but suffice to say it doesn't excel or help cover the show's weaknesses, as good music sometimes can.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at Arpeggio's story in a \u201cbig picture\u201d light reveals interesting results in that, at the end of the day, there's really no detail to it whatsoever. The world-building is virtually nonexistent, to the point where I'd venture to say there's little that you couldn't learn about the world of Arpeggio from reading a three-sentence plot synopsis. The show proffers a fairly elaborate premise, but it stubbornly refuses to answer any questions about its overarching plot or setting\u2014not the ones that will naturally occur to you, and, perhaps worse, not even the ones that it explicitly raises. Among the former will be perfectly logical ponderings, the answers to which would be required to achieve a minimum amount of richness in the setting, like: In a war where both sides have advanced futuristic technology, why aren't there any airplanes? If the Fog mental models are nearly indestructible and visually indistinguishable from human beings, why don't the Fog just send them ashore to covertly destroy vital targets? And so on. Among the latter will be vital, should-really-be-answered queries along the lines of \u201cwhat are the Fog?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nNo, seriously, they never even attempt to address that. The Fog battleships repeatedly refer to themselves as \u201cjust weapons\u201d that are \u201cprogrammed to obey the Admirality Code\u201d (the Admirality Code being an ill-defined set of rules, first mentioned three-quarters of the way into the show, that governs the actions of the battleships). This leads to the assumption that the Fleet of Fog are just tools, and the true masterminds behind the Fog invasion lie elsewhere; weapons require weapons designers, and programs require programmers. The show hints at human interactions with the Fog\u2014it's suggested that the main character's father defected to the side of the Fog\u2014but the idea lies abandoned and utterly unexplored. The mysteries are never solved. Much of the show is spent fighting a shadow enemy whose nature, origin, and motivations remain completely veiled. Several episodes of the series even have the audacity to end with a taunting overlay of text which reads (presumably referring to the Fog): \u201cWhere do we come from? What are we? Where are we going?\u201d Even after the credits rolled at the end of the final episode, I could still only answer all three with \u201cI don't know,\u201d which spells trouble. \\n\\n\r\nAll of that might be forgivable if the setting and war were only a backdrop used to stimulate some excellent characterization\u2014such tactics have been known to work. And, honestly, that might be what the series is going for. Whatever else might be wrong with it, it does expend a fair bit of effort (largely wasted effort, but genuine effort nonetheless) trying to explore its characters. Sometimes it comes within arm's reach of the right notes. Like Haruna, an especially cold and vicious Fog mental model, forming a bond with a perceptive young girl who emotionally disarms her, or Iona's struggle to obey Gunzou's orders while knowing that obeying could potentially cause his death. Those aren't bad ideas at all. The show wants, desperately, to have characters who change, and change they do. It's telegraphed at us, and not very subtle, but it's there.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that the impetus for change is missing. The series has flawed internal logic\u2014it presents the Fog mental models as thoughtless machines, explicitly stating that they are governed by programs that cannot learn from past mistakes, adapt, or feel. There is never a convincing reason given regarding why they suddenly adopt emotions and human values. And that's kind of a big deal. I don't care how heartwarming the story of a little girl is, or how charismatic a sailor is\u2014if you put robots who have no capacity for emotion next to them, the robots will not suddenly be moved to tears and love. No amount of emotion can overwhelm something that is literally incapable of feeling emotion. Talk to a wall for a little while and you're likely to notice that, no matter how much and how loud you talk, the wall does not respond. This is because your voice's volume does not alter the complete and utter inability of the wall to comprehend and reproduce your language of choice. Same difference here; the presence of emotion in the outside world can't simply inspire emotion in the void of a computer. That's deeply flawed thinking which would require a workaround within the context of the series. If there were some sort of external explanation provided, even a cheap one like \u201cturns out there was a hidden emotion switch in the Fog after all,\u201d some sense might be made of the situation, but, predictably, there's nothing. Which sucks, because that means that half of the equation is missing. If a character changes, I'd like to know why it's happening, or it's just as bad as having a character who is static and unmoving. If you present characters as machines, and then they suddenly sprout the mindset of normal human beings for no real reason, it defeats the entire narrative purpose of presenting them as machines in the first place. It essentially strips the characters of their distinguishing features, and adds a big tint of insincerity to everything that they go through.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing that might have saved Arpeggio would be the battles. It sounds next to impossible to screw up \u201cgiant sentient battleships blow each other to hell,\u201d and while good execution of that concept would not necessarily result in a good series, it would at least provide an audience with one reason, lacking any others, to watch it. But even this somehow manages to go awry. Never has large-scale warfare been so boring. The battles, though sometimes as long as ten or fifteen minutes, are dreadfully uneventful, usually consisting of a lot of technobabble about force fields and gravitron cannons and the like. The more strategy-focused crowd will be glad to know that our fearless captain, Gunzou, is the proud creator of such novel naval warfare tactics as \u201cwait for the enemy to fire a bunch of torpedoes at us, then dodge them, then fire back and hope it works.\u201d Battles are regularly concluded with routine and anticlimactic solutions, such as the above, or solutions that appear out of nowhere, such as Gunzou realizing that he can just use some weapon or defensive feature of the submarine that the audience didn't even know existed. Even when things do get dire for all of those aboard, the lack of emotional resonance in the writing assures that the tension level remains at zero.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I'm getting at is that this show consists of misstep after misstep, and they often work together to form seamless spans of pointlessness which would be a waste of time for anyone to endure of their own free will. The lack of world-building and knowledge about the Fog coincides nicely with the characterization issues to form a gaping hole where the compelling internals should be. The dreadful animation and boring battles sync up all too well, affording the audience a chance to stare at a low-stakes game of chicken that isn't even produced well enough to serve as an eye-candy distraction. When all was said and done, I came away with the impression that I had basically watched a show about things who look like girls that do stuff for some reason. And I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone.",

            "content": "On the surface Arpeggio has a few detractors but if you allow people to finish airing their subjective complaints about how CG never blends well with anime, the harem genre is overused and how they don\u2019t want to be made to remember complicated words like Super gravity Cannon and Klein\u2019s field, you\u2019ll find that Arpeggio has a decent story, a setting with rich possibilities heavily untapped by the anime world, interesting characters and an all but obvious moral lesson at the end.\r\nFor 7 years the Fleet of Fog, an armada of highly advance naval vessels have taken over earthly waters, with every attempt to reclaimback the waters by humanity crushed. Chihaya Gunzou is a student at a naval academy who one day is approached by a girl named Iona who introduces herself as a member of the Fog. The first episode isn\u2019t kind to those looking for a subtle introduction as it is packed full of content, the series sense of immediacy may overwhelm some as in only the first episode it entails storyline, introductions, info dumps and even flash backs, all this equals to the series greatest weakness, its length, which I\u2019ll talk about later. Chihaya Gunzou\u2019s fleet is tasked with delivering a new weapon to America soon after with the Fog in his path leading to naval confrontations. The series can also be praised for its sound sense of tactical warfare as the battles take a balanced approach between stratagem and action orientation, the chemistry of Gunzo and his crewmates also deserve praise as everybody is well aware of their objectives and every line a character speaks out deserves just cause and not just for the sake of a seiyuu getting lines, however this is only in combat.\\n\\n\r\nThe fleet of the Fog being all AIs have a set of logical reasoning they follow called the Admiralty code, which a few of the fog members later on start to question, the series takes a very nice new dimension when this new plot element comes into play that suddenly give these formerly one dimensional characters a lot of depth, all of a sudden characters who one might think were nothing more than opponents the main cast might hurdle over, suddenly are given meaning and purpose, and the storyline sees a vast change mostly for the better. Although some people might complain about the existence of the mental models, the way the battleships take human form, keep in mind that without this the members of the fog would be nothing more than your casual unknown evil group trying to take over the world, their presentation to the physical gives Arpeggio much room to express itself as something much more than a simple war story, the mental model may seem to translate to a light hearted and subtle theme but Arpeggio is quite serious and even takes darker routes towards its conclusion, but as to why the fog members decided to all pick up female archetypes is still something up for debate.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of Arpeggio\u2019s issues can be traced back to its length, 12 episodes was not enough for it to truly present itself, the result of this is several holes in explanations and lack of enough back story to keep the series standing firm. A very obvious element that the series should definitely have covered was the origins of the fog, because as it stands \u201csudden appearance\u201d is not enough a reason to justify their existence, but as its source material is still ongoing, this might be something we can willingly forgive. The presentation of the fog can also be considered underwhelming, a regiment vast enough to conquer all of earth\u2019s waters should at least number in the ten thousands\u2019, the anime does very little to reflect the fog as the dominant force it should be and unfortunately only concentrates on 9 members, larger numbers would have gone a long way in stating the anime\u2019s intent as something to be taken very seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing to say about the art style is, CG and cute girls were made for each other, haters be damned. As opposed to most CG you see in anime these days, Arpeggio boasts some extremely high quality rendering, the coloring blends well and they hit the brightness level just perfectly and that\u2019s not even counting in the outstanding character designs. The CG actually compliments the world of Arpeggio so well that it\u2019s honestly hard to imagine the series without it. Also given the ease CG gives animators they rightfully \u2018flexed their muscles\u2019, colorful sceneries, radical movements and flamboyant naval combats are all present and executed fluidly. The opening theme \u2018Savior of Song\u2019 by Nano is nothing short of sublime, an absolutely riveting and exciting high beat Pop-rock that highly deserves more than one viewing an episode, the part with character montages striking the most interest. The ending \u2018Blue Field\u2019 by Trident is an ever so alluring slow and somber beat that melded well with the slow animation of its sequence. \\n\\n\r\nThe approach the author did in characterization here was actually presenting characters with several diverse personalities, enough personalities that viewers would undoubtedly find a favorite quite easily. The MC Chihaya Gunzou really impresses when in his Command Center, even though you hold no military knowledge watching the way he assesses situations and gives out orders accordingly with commanding presence makes the naval battles so much more interesting, his leadership skills and tactical know how are one of Arpeggio\u2019s brightest aspects, however outside of his CC he\u2019s kind of a dud. Iona on the other hand has very little to give to the viewer, from start to finish all she does is receive, process and carry out her captain\u2019s orders, her apathic nature although going perfectly with the nature of the series still made her hard to like and the show of \u2018will\u2019 she performs at the end did very little to refute her. The real joy however you\u2019ll find are with the different Girls of the Fog, AI or not, how they chose to present themselves was both alluring and dazzling and their interactions are a joy to watch, most of this will stem from your initial knowledge of how strict the workings of the fog is but seeing how their characters change really brings a great sense of joy for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe vast possibilities Arpeggio could have produced or explored if it wasn\u2019t rushed are nearly endless, however Arpeggio should not be viewed as a simple tale of Man Vs. Machine as it incorporates so much more, it is a battle to find out and discovers one true self and meaning of existence, searching for answers to the all-important questions, how coexistence is an important value and Sentient is more than enough of a reason for us all to live together in peace.",

            "content": "Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova Full Review\r\nI would say that Aoki Hagane is one of those dark horse anime this season. Not many people watched it, maybe because they didn\u2019t like the art style or maybe just the idea behind battleships. So, is this a worthy investment of your time? Let\u2019s take a look!\r\nNote: There will be minor spoilers. \r\nStory (9/10): \r\nThe story of Aoki Hagane is broken up into two parts. First, is the battle between humans and the forces of the Fog. This is basically the universe it is set in, and our hero, Chihaya Gunzou, somehow manages to obtain the powerof one of the Fog\u2019s submarine, Iona 401, which turns the tide of the battle. What\u2019s great about this is that it Gunzou and Iona are sort of the neutral party. Yes, they are fighting against the Fog, but the army is also hostile towards them because they are afraid Gunzou would use Iona\u2019s power against them, or that Iona might go berserk and attack them instead. This brings about a much more interesting storyline and more tension. Imagine the whole world is against you, and just how intense that would be? \\n\\n\r\nSecond part of the story is how members of the Fog with Mental Models develop human characteristics such as emotions, logical thinking and relationships, and these lead to them questioning the basis of their actions. It\u2019s this internal struggle between to do what you\u2019re made to do (as weapons), or to follow your heart\u2019s desire. While the development in this aspect is a little cliche, it\u2019s still an awesome story device that makes the story filled with so much more depth, rather than just battles between ships.\\n\\n\r\nLet me discuss a little about the battles. These battles are one of the most intense and well made scenes I\u2019ve ever seen, and it thoroughly reminds me of Code Geass, such that battles are not won with sheer power and might, but with logic and strategic thinking to outsmart the enemy. Aoki Hagane does this extremely well, immersing the viewers in that amazing experience. If you liked the battles in Code Geass, expect to find the same epicness here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nAoki Hagane is weird such that its supporting characters (with the exception of Iona) get plenty of development. In which case, we see the Mental Models of the fog undergo character developments as they are more exposed to humans. No longer are they just weapons, but more... Human. It is interesting to see how each of them transforms based on different reasons and experiences. The issue here is that some of their transformations, or rather, developments, are not as justified or too sudden.Though, it was really interesting to see these characters interact, because they are not your typical stereotypes such as Tsundere or Kuudere or whatever other deres, as such, their personalities were different.What I would\u2019ve liked to see was perhaps even more development for them. While they did have developments, it felt a little lacking when the story was centered on them. \\n\\n\r\nChihaya Gunzou pretty much remains the same throughout the show. That doesn\u2019t make him bad in anyway, though. He\u2019s an extremely interesting character with the wit of Lelouch and the nobility of the other characters such as Kamijou Touma(putting others before himself).  In other words, you get a character that is smart, witty and puts others before him. What more can you want?\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I have with the characters is perhaps of the other crew members. They have so little screentime and development that I can\u2019t even remember what their names are. What is their purpose of joining Gunzou, or what is their personality like, it\u2019s really hard to tell. It\u2019s as if they were there for the sole purpose of operating Iona 401. However, this is not that big of an issue because it doesn\u2019t really hurt the story that much.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for this anime is amazing. Special credits to nano\u2019s Saviour of Song, the opening for this anime. Not only is it catchy, but every time you listen to it, it is as if you\u2019re ready for a naval battle. The instrumental just fits the anime so well. The ending song, Blue Field, also has that \u201csea feel\u201d if you get what I\u2019m going at.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the instruments played especially during the battle scenes fits it so well. Adding so much more tension that really makes you feel as if you\u2019re in that battle itself.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for this anime is interesting such that it\u2019s done with CGI. As such, you would notice that the characters movements look a bit as though it\u2019s a game. It\u2019s the first time an anime has applied this technique, and I must say it was done quite well. It might put you off at first, but once you get used to it, you\u2019ll notice just how good it actually looks.\\n\\n\r\nThe animations for the battle scenes are especially well done. Throughout the entire scene, the battles flow smoothly. The explosions are especially well done. It can be split into two parts, Corrosion Impact and High Explosive. Both look just as beautiful when they impact the target.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9.5/10)\\n\\n\r\nInitially I dropped this anime because of the art style, but I\u2019m very glad I picked it up again. I absolutely loved Code Geass, as an anime that is not just about battles. Aoki Hagane manages to do the same thing, though not as well as Code Geass (due to lack of episodes) but I\u2019m able to feel that same type of enjoyment. I think I could\u2019ve found a new love for battleships because of this anime... Anyway, every episode is interesting because of the battles and the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI especially enjoyed the opening theme, having always listen to it and sing along just because its that catchy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8.5/10)\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I like Aoki Hagane, from a reviewer\u2019s standpoint, I would have to give it an 8.5/10. Characters could definitely been developed a little bit more. If that was the case, I would defintely give it a 9/10 or even a 10/10. That being said, I still highly recommend Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio; you will not be disappointed.\\n",

            "content": "Note:  this review of Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: ARS Nova contains minor spoilers.  \r\nSo, how did I like the series?  Well, let me take it by parts:\r\nStory:  8/10\r\nThere were both positives and negatives to the story.    \r\nOn the positive side, I felt the story was very entertaining and brought back memories of Space Opera.  Space Opera is one of the genres of anime that I have lamented seeing very little of over the last few years.  It was a staple of the early years of anime, but is almost gone now.  ARS Nova isn\u2019t spaceopera, as it takes place at sea, but it has a similar feel to it (i.e. Outlaw Star).  \\n\\n\r\nThe human race has been isolated due to the \u2018Fleet of Fog\u2019, an enigmatic fleet of battleships with awesome weapons that wiped out the human naval forces seven years ago and then\u2026 nothing.  So, who are the crew of the Fleet of Fog?  What type of eerie alien creatures inhabit the ships?  Or, since this is an anime, what type of uber-beautiful humanoids females crew the ships?  As it turns out, there are no crew, as the ships are sentient.  Aww, so no pretty girls \uf04c.  Not to worry, the ships sentience can manifest themselves into \u2018Mental Models\u2019 that, of course, are uber-beautiful females.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I liked is how the story slowly morphed into a Harem without it really affecting the base story.  Yes, there was the ubiquitous beach scene, and yes, there were several girls liking the main character.  But at least he\u2019s a cool main character.\\n\\n\r\nThere were a few negatives to the story, however.  First, the idea of alien beings taking the form of humans and then essentially being reprogrammed by those pesky human emotions is not an original idea.  While I won\u2019t state that it is a rip-off of the underlying theme of Robotech, it is still the exact same premise.  The second issue I had with the story is the lack of a back-story.  I think there was about 5 minutes of the was seven years prior.  Where did the Fog come from, how did the rest of the crew get onboard 401, and what actually happened after Hyuuga was sank, just to name a few.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Visuals \u2013 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the art and visuals is one of the best things about the whole series.  Yes, yes, I know all the naysayers out there who\u2019ve complained about the CG aspect of the ships.  I do not agree.  The CG, as it was used only for the ships, was a major enhancer to the series, rather than a detractor.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 7/10\\n\\n\r\nQuite possibly the least favorable part of the series was the soundtrack.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, the opening, \u201cSavior of Song\", is performed by Nano and is quite good.  The endings, as well as the score during the battles scenes are also are also good.  However, the remainder of the series had very minimal sound accompaniment, which is quite possibly the only detractor in the series for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWith a few exception, the character development was quite good for the series.  The main character and the fog girls were detailed pretty meticulously, which is something that I appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nI like strong, unpredictable main characters.  Gunzou Chihaya was the perfect captain for the 401.  He\u2019s unpredictable, doesn\u2019t say much, but is always is one step ahead of the enemy.   While he is no Marko Ramius (Hunt For Red October) when it comes to submarine battles, he was able to use unpredictable tactics, like the remote launchers to keep defeating the Fog ships.  His style and his composure brought me glimpses of David Weber\u2019s Honor Harrington.\\n\\n\r\nI had an issue with some of his crew, however.  What\u2019s the deal with mask-man?  If they\u2019re going to do a mask, at least make it aesthetically pleasing.  He looked like Abe the fish-man from Hellboy.  I did hear one subtle mention about allergies, but I don\u2019t buy it.  The rest of the crew were OK (the engine room girl (don\u2019t know her name) is quite possibly the cutest girl in the whole series) and the black guy with the pony-tail was also really cool.\\n\\n\r\nI did like the Fog girls.  Iona is just so darn cute.  I personally like small girls, and she fit the bill nicely.  None of the girls had big knockers, which would have been a real detractor in my mind.  Takeo is funny and cute, but Kirishima seemed to be cut from the same cloth as her, which is most likely why they kept her as a teddy bear.  However, the true jewel, of course, was Haruna.  While not the prettiest face, and her coat is a sick joke, but outside of the coat, she is hot.  Maya was adorable, and I actually liked Kongou \u2013 brought back memories of another alien who nearly went insane from emotions:  Khyron.  Somewhat ambivalent about Hyuuga, then again, I personally don\u2019t really see a need for a yuri aspect.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the series, and it is currently the best series of the season for me.  Of course I still have a few more to go.  The battle scenes were good, almost reminiscent of Hunt for Red October mixed with an Outlaw Star type of Space Opera, and the non battle scenes were not filler.  They were actually useful to move the series along.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this a 9/10, and I definitely hope that there will be a second season.",

We have bunch of lolis who are secretly battleships, yellow submarines and nice boats. Then there is something about warstuff and tactics and politics and other wise stuff which is presented pseudo. There is apparently a plot in this series too, but I have no idea what it is about so I can't really tell if it is bad or not, but I don't think it matters either. \r\nI would say something about the characters, but Ihave nothing to add past overwhelming female to male ration. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is terribad and the animation is about some CGI protocol powered by a b class pu process.

            "content": "Ars Nova is a pathetic, delusional, self-insert fantasy written by and for people who would be much better off aiming low. Here's the story line from a similar series: an ugly, boring, stinking gamer finds himself no longer having to concern himself with the tedious things in life (such as bathing) and is forced to spend every second of every day playing a computer game. In so doing he becomes everyone's hero and gets all the chicks. Like that series, whilst watching Ars Nova you are expected to supplant your own boring and probably depressing existence with the lead character's. Gunzou Chihaya is a skinnyand completely uninteresting teenage boy who finds himself as the only human being able to control an alien battleship that for some reason is also a (barely pubescent) hot chick. This gives him the power to defy all authority and basically do whatever he wants. What he wishes to do is become a hero of all the girls who dry-wretched at his odour back in highschool, so he goes off to fight the armada of alien battleships that is currently attacking Earth. It is of no surprise that each of these ships is also a hot chick, some being unable to resist him. \\n\\n\r\nThere is little point discussing details such as animation quality and sound because the basic premise of someone like that being given that kind of power and acting in that sort of way is so absurd that it is hard to watch without wanting to defenestrate your TV. And everything is geared towards selling this fap. The alien ships have artificial intelligence and are designed to function on their own, yet they want him as their captain to order them around. And there's even a crew added to his ship whose only purpose is to gasp at his courage, be awed by his tactical genius, and basically boost him up to being some kind of Captain fucking Stupendous. And this is all done without him doing a single thing even remotely interesting or likeable, let alone endearing to the point of obsession. \\n\\n\r\nAoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova seems to be nothing more than a loser's desperate wish to gain admiration and respect. Rather than shows like this, maybe you should try starting with soap.",

Not so many Action, Sci-Fi anime can be good without using those things but this anime just made it possible. However, this anime is too underrated than it actually is.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nStory of the world in 2039 where all the sea transportation has been blocked out by a group of mysterious warships called \"Fleet of Fog\" which has more advanced technology than mankind's and ended mankind's long last history of involvement with the seas.\r\nThe story seems a bit too much of fantasyand too unreasonable. However, there is only a few flaws other than this one. The way the story takes it's pace is very good. And Filled with warm-heart scenes which presents moral.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe first thing that impressed me when I first watched this anime is it's art. Superb graphic and animations. New-generation graphic of rendering character's animations was used in this anime which still imperfect but it's really shows the contrast of how better it is between old-generation and the new one. The background and the effects also very good, as well as how they adjust the light and flares effects. And I'm impressed by the camera angle and composition adjusting of this anime which be able to show the meanings and stories out of it. Not just the sound and the context shows the story but the camera angle and scenes compositioning as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nYes, this anime got music composer from the DMC series. Made out perfect soundtracks. Made almost all the scenes more emotional. As well as the opening theme, ending theme and inserted songs by Nano which absolutely perfect. I really love the song \"Silver Sky\", the violin sounds really nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nVery good characters design and planning. All of them looks nice and implementing with the new-generation graphics, it's perfect. Characters' personality and acting is good. Each characters has quiet a unique personality  and decision which makes them unique as an individual.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThis series way of presenting is really enjoyable. Filled with Action, conducted by Fantasy which based on Sci-Fi, a bit taste of Romance and presented in Seinen way. Nice combination. Moreover, this series presented lots of naval tactics which really made me enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is a great series. I pretty much understand why it is underrated by the community. Different of individual taste and enjoyment made it hard for this kind of best-of-nothing-but-good-at-everything anime for getting high scores. But for me, I really recommend this anime. I really enjoyed it and I hope you can enjoy it as well. :)",

Another thing I loved is that this has the set up to be a harem (1 guy, tons of powerful, attractive girls) but doesn't turn into one. There's only 1 love triangle and all the other mental model girls have their own motivations.  The mental model characters are fleshed out very well and think is one of the best female supporting casts I've seen. Iona is probably the best character, with all of the ship mental models following closely second.  \r\nOn the downside,the actual human cast is rather one dimensional. I don't understand everyone's fascination with the MC Gunzo, except Iona.  This is probably due to only having half a season, but that doesn't excuse it.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, you have to give this the 3 episode test, because it really doesn't hook until ep 3, IMO.\\n",

            "content": "I know, I know, I fricking know... This review is WAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY overdue but hey, as per the good 'ole saying, better late than never now, right? RIGHT!? \r\nAlright so... Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova, or just Ars Nova for short is basically an \"Annihilate the ultra-malicious sentient A.I while politicking and surviving at the same time\" story revolving around a small group of naval cadets who came into contact with one of the 'sentient A.I', went A.W.O.L., sailed off into the horizon in their souped-up alien sub, torpedoing enemy ships into the deep depths and basically gathering more intel throughout their mission. \r\nIf thatkinda story doesn't make you go \"OH MAI GADD, that is SOOOO what-EVVAR\", and that it excites you as you see things 'blow up', then this might just wanna make you shout out into the dark sky DEMANDING more.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, the story's premise is actually pretty interesting to those who fancy these kinda stories, though I must admit that premises such as these are getting increasingly saturated in fictional media. Nevertheless, what manages to salvage this particular one from being \"just another one a' those\" stories is in the manner it actually keeps steady the element of mystery surrounding the sentient A.Is' origins and motives for their mass invasion of Earth. The steady introduction of plot elements that explore the nuances of the sentient nature of the A.Is, the political landscape of the remaining human survivors, as well as the goals of the primary protagonist allows depth in the storytelling, which would be lost if the story was just about BOOM-BOOM-KABOOM-BOOMs 24/7, ala. Michael Bay.\\n\\n\r\nBut, there are a few misconducts here and there, in particular the lack of exploration in the primary protagonist's back story (which was implied and stated to carry great significance in the plot), as well as the utilizing of some rather odd (read: 'tropey') directions in the development of the sentient A.I characters' personalities, and a very debatable Deus ex Machina scene as the series nears its end.\\n\\n\r\nStory Rating: 8\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nArtistically speaking, this series is a stunner. Buuuut, it might just not appeal to everyone due to its use of 3D-CGI graphics as its main animation style. The series bleeds with rich, vibrant and vivid coloring at almost all points throughout its run time and the 3D animation frame rate doesn't experience any considerable, or noticeable drops. Also, the sheer detail put into the backgrounds, the naval war vessels, the numerous action scenes, the opening and ending sequences, character design variety, ship transformation sequences and so on and so forth is astounding! But best of all, for an anime that greatly utilizes water as the primary background setting for much of its course, the depiction of water in this anime is a downright pleasure to look at, as it just leaves one in a state of awe and admiration at times. \\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, very few to zero animation hick-ups or inconsistencies. So rest easy on that.\\n\\n\r\nArt Rating: 10\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nIf the art and animation themselves are great enough, then the sound-based aspects of this show are equally as great, for they are nothing short of meticulous and very well-produced. The sound effects are truly a pleasure to listen to, highly nuanced, and very accurate to what actually happens -or might happen- when the conditions are right and the chances for occurrence are high.\\n\\n\r\nNotwithstanding that, even the voice acting in this show is definitely up to par, especially with the show's main A.I antagonist, the primary protagonist, and several of the side characters. The VAs really bring forth the life and personality of each character and no scene felt stale, amateurish or over/under-acted. One particular standout scene appears as the series nears its end, though figuring out which scene that was is up to you to watch the show till its conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nSound Rating: 10\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nRiiiight... Even though the VAs really breathe life and personality into their roles, unfortunately the characters themselves are rather lacking, as many of them -in particular the sentient A.I characters- are based off well-worn tropes in the Japanese anime/manga/gaming spectrum. The main A.I antagonist gets more complex character development later on, but the conclusion to that antagonist's character development is rather stale and standard, unfortunately. Despite all that though, there were several scenes that show the willingness of these characters to become more serious as the situation arises accordingly, even though their motives during such situations are still very tropey in nature. Overall, this is easily the weakest part of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Rating: 6\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nFrankly, I enjoyed the heck outta this series. Not only is it intellectually stimulating at times due to the addition of political and philosophical elements, it also excites the more militaristic and battle-oriented side of me as I just simply love to get to know more, or see anything related to the military get referenced in a piece of fiction. Action scenes are everywhere, but nowhere are they gratuitous, as the battles that take place in this story actually impact the story line and help steer it towards its conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nAnd ah yes, THAT OPENING THEME! Easily ONE OF THE MOST EPIC ones that I've seen last year. Woah, just woah. Greatly excites me anytime of the day, save for when I'm really, really down in the dumps.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment Rating: 9\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nHah, should I recommend you this? Why, OF COURSE! But, then again, it really does depend on whether you actually like these kinds of stories, and that yes, the tropeyness of some of the characters really does leave one with second thoughts on whether this thing is really something that one can dedicate time to.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, the final verdict:\\n\\n\r\n[9 For Personal Rating]\\n\\n\r\nAnd\\n\\n\r\n[8 For Critical Rating]\\n\\n\r\nI bid all of you farewell, till next time then.",

            "content": "Three words, Harem Battleship Fleet.  \r\nThat is all I have to say about this anime.  \r\nReview done (But not really...)\r\nSpoiler alerts\r\nStory: 6\r\nIn a world where sea travel and communication does no't exist because of a strange fleet called \"The Fog\", we follow a captain, Gunzou, and his crew which includes teenagers and a loli submarine.   This loli submarine turns out to be Iona, a member of \"The Fog\" who was given orders to obey Gunzou.  The combination of a great submarine and a great captain, the crew overcomes their obstacles, make new allies, as well as new enemies.  \r\nThepacing was fine, a few spots, especially prior to an action scene, were fast paced.  They always seemed to want to head straight into the action, but this is where they excelled, which I will explain more about in the art section.  \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem I had with this story was the fact that nothing was carried through all the way.  What seemed to almost start a political war was quickly ignored by action.  What was about to be an answer to questions that we may never get an answer too (possibly if there is a season two?).  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nCG art is starting to pick up in anime, and it has it's ups and downs.  Outside of action scenes, the CG art looked great!  I had no problem with the way the series looked, but then things started getting animated, and it the movement looked so forced.  Things such as hair, hands, arms, legs, all moved awkwardly.\\n\\n\r\nAction scenes on the other hand were amazing, the CG art promoted the sci-fi feel of the anime as well as the animation looking more smooth and not as awkward.  The final fight blew me away, the art was amazing to look at and the way it was animated... eyegasm.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs were great, enjoyed the designs of all the characters.  The only complaint on character designs were to make I-400 and I-402 a more unique.  Their designs were already based on Iona, since they are sisters, but they only added few unique things and the colors they chose for both of them, a pale green and a pale purple, weren't too distinguishing.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nThe OP, Savior of Song, is a rock techno mix that works well with the anime, since it is an action sci-fi series.  For some reason though, this OP wasn't my cup of tea and didn't really stick in my head like most OPs do.  The anime had four EDs, one being the OP, and the other three being Blue Field, Innocent Blue and Our Story.  The EDs weren't that bad, I didn't mind listening to them, but not that amazing either.  An average OP and average EDs.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music was few and between, and I wished they had used it more, as it would have helped set the moods at times.  The times they had background music, it was used really well, if they had more, i'm sure they would have done a great job with that as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nOutside of the Fog characters and the main character, all the other characters didn't have enough depth to make the memorable.  Who was the one Japanese politician?  Who was the engineer of the ship?  Names easily forgotten on characters that seemed more important than just a side character.  The Fog characters were amazing, and I wish I could see more of them.  More Haruna, more Hyuga, just MORE FOG PLEASE.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was nice, since it was a primary theme of this anime.  Seeing the captain, Iona and the other Fog ships develop was nice to see.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10+\\n\r\nEven though the subcategories scored low, this anime was very enjoyable to watch.  The action scenes were great, and the characters that were the main character and Fog were very enjoyable.  Seeing awesome female characters is a plus as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThe enjoyment I got from this anime was so high, that this anime is my favorite of the fall season.  Hope there will be more.\\n",

            "content": "I have just finished watching this anime, and for the first time I feel motivated to actually write down my thoughts on it.\r\nAoki Hagane is a good anime. It looks really nice (in my opinion, although I know that the CG style is not everyone's favourite, it's easy on the eyes and I personally enjoy the art quite a lot) and it has plenty of amazing moments (no spoilers, of course).\r\nI won't write a detailed summary of the story, but I will say that the story line of Aoki Hagane is not exactly new - mysterious non-human battleships overpowering all of mankind, except for ChihayaGunzou and the rest of the crew of the Fog submarine I-401, Iona, who are attempting to cross the Pacific in one last attempt to save humanity. It's not a huge leap from, to name an anime at random, Strike Witches, especially with the common idea of certain individuals of the Fog joining the heroes.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual story itself is fairly simple, but generally remains sensible and within the bounds of its own rules (outside of a few plot holes which only arise in hindsight). Instead, the anime tends to focus more on the Fog and their interactions. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as the Fog (the 'mental models' of the enemy warships) are interesting enough characters by themselves. Even so, the ships are quite obviously the main characters of the anime, bar a handful of episodes which show the human politics which are going on in the background.\\n\\n\r\nBy and large, however, the humans - and most noticeably, Iona's crew - take a backseat to the other characters. We are barely given a few seconds in the first episode which hint that Gunzou may actually have a backstory, but not even the slightest attempt is made to explore this - and even less so for the other members of his crew, most of whom have less lines than a certain teddy bear. This is a shame, because initially I had the impression that Aoki Hagane was going to be an anime about Gunzou rebelling against the government as much as it was about fighting the Fog.\\n\\n\r\nPutting aside the fact that Gunzou and his crew have badly (if at all) explained motivation for their part in the story, I feel that Aoki Hagane does a good job of building those characters which it chooses to build. The ships are distinctive and it's interesting to watch their characters grow over the course of their dialogues.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in summary: Aoki Hagane is a very good anime, that gives a new meaning to the phrase 'nice boat'. There are many things which it does well, as well as things that it does not do so well. Personally, I find this anime is very enjoyable in spite of the main drawback (which is the lack of character building for any of the human characters), but I can see how it would simply be far too irritating to have so many unanswered questions. So, I will give this anime a tentative 8, because I feel that what it does do is done very well.",

            "content": "Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova was one of the most underrated anime of the Fall 2013 season. This anime aired at the same time as the popular anime from this season such as Kill la Kill, Log Horizon, Beyond the Boundary, Magi, Nagi no Asakura, Kuroko no Basuke, Non Non Biyori, etc. \r\nStory:\r\nThe storyline seems to be confusing at first, but as you get to episode four, it\u2019s easier to comprehend. You\u2019ll understand the purpose of \u201cthe Fleet\u201d and their origins as well. Since this anime aired before KanColle, the concept of female characters controlling a warship was unique. All of the members of\u201cthe Fleet\u201d are female, so this anime turns into an \u201cunconventional harem\u201d. In other words, there were more female characters than male characters, but not all of the girls were in love with the MC- Gunzou Chihaya. Anyhow, the story followed the basic plot diagram with one major plot twist. \\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nDon\u2019t underestimate the CGI animation or the \u201ctongue-twisting\u201d title of the anime. The animation was distinct from the other anime that aired in the 2013 fall season. The CGI animation gave me the vibe from those cut scenes from Fire Emblem: Awakening. In fact, from all cut scenes of video games I\u2019ve played in the past. Also, the CGI elements form gave me a nostalgic feeling from another TV show that used the same animation style. I can\u2019t recall the name of the show, though. \\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe theme song was one of the best things to come out of the series. As for the sound, it was pretty sharp which reminded me of other sci-fi movies I\u2019ve watched in the past. The voice acting was great too, each role was proper.\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe series had interesting and memorable characters. Each character had unique personalities and appearances. It didn\u2019t make me feel like I was watching a character that looks similar to another character from a different series I\u2019ve watched. Also, each key character had their spotlight, so no one was left out. The top 5 Character of the series were: \\n\r\n1. Iona/I-401: A combination of Kanade from Angel Beats and Shiro from No Game No Life. One of the most underrated Kuudere girls out there.\\n\r\n2. Takao: She shares a similar resemblance to Hatsune Miku, I\u2019m not kidding. When I first saw her, the first character that came to mind was Miku. The only difference is the tone of their hair color. Anyways, she\u2019s a well-developed and well-designed character, and she does something that will make you love her.\\n\r\n3. Haruna: The third best girl of the series. She\u2019s cute when someone takes her coat off and when she puts it on. Shazam\u2026.\\n\r\n4. Gunzou Chihaya: He has that mature personality that is suiting for a captain of the ship. His character design is great as well.\\n\r\n5. Hyuuga and Kirishima (Tie): Can\u2019t say much about these two other than being great comic relief characters. They\u2019re memorable characters that played their part.\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Colorful characters\\n\r\n-Sharp Sound\\n\r\n-Unique Animation Style\\n\r\n-Simple Plot\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Lackluster villains: The series needed better villains other than one that was easy to beat.\\n\r\n-Misleading title: Try saying the title 10 times without messing up. \\n\r\nClosing Statement: \\n\r\nThis anime was a Secret Santa gift from \u201cfillyy\", so thank you for recommending me this anime. Also, this anime was the last anime I watched in 2015.",

If it is already a magnificent anime by itself Hagane is the kind of anime that you give nothing, because it is about boats / submarines. However, it has a differential. In addition to the vessels having \"feelings\" and kind of being \"people\", it tackles a very peculiar theme. The anime itself, happens in the future. Almost no more earth, surface. So the most powerful military is the navy. The main character, as captain of his crew. It performs certain services, for the navy, and the anime, it goes basically unfolding in this. But why, Hagane can be so good? First: the main character, is a genius strategist. And \"smart\" characters are always well-regarded. Second: the anime is based on a future post apocalyptic medium, with a touch of Seinen and Cyber-punk. For those who love such a theme, they will love. Third: the story that the anime presents, is good, so there is so much to complain about. And fourth: the anime brings something innovative, which is the submarine battles, based on strategies and everything. And that's why Hagane manages to be so good.",

            "content": "Overall opinion: It's an ok anime, it could have been much better.\r\nStory 6/10 I'm quite disappointed regarding the storyline of this anime. Although the storyline isn't terrible, it doesn't progress much and there are some things that should have been included in it. So the anime is pretty much about a boy commanding a submarine and a few warships and defeating a group of enemy ships known as the 'Fog Fleet' that have been attacking human ships. One of the things that really should have been included in the anime is the origins of the fog fleet. The only things we really know about thefog fleet are that they are pretty much a group of super warships armed with weapons that surpass human technology that aim to destroy human ships at sea and the fact that they are given orders from an unknown authority that controls them. Other 'holes' in the storyline include what happens to maya after kongo is defeated and even more important, the fate of the fog fleet. Do they eventually come under the control of Gunzo or do they all get destroyed, wiping out their threat? Regarding Maya after Kongo absorbed her, how come she doesn't reappear after Kongo's defeat from Iona? Furthermore, we don't even see Gunzo successfully delivering the torpedo that has the potential to defeat the fog fleet to USA. The storyline is quite shallow and it lacks some important things, lowering the score down.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10  The animation in arpeggio of blue steel is outstanding. CGI effects during the battles are especially stunning. It looks boss when the lasers and missiles explode or hit on impact. Character design is also excellent.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10 The sound track is great in the anime. The opening song suits this anime very well. The sound for the battles is also done well and it mixes well with the stunning animation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10 I don't really like the characters much in this anime. Most of the time, the characters are really one-dimensional and you don't see much about them because they don't spend much time on the screen. Another thing I find doesn't make much sense is why the characters (except Iona) choose to follow Gunzo instead of staying with the fog fleet. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10 Arpeggio of blue steel is a reasonably good anime if you like anime that has superb animation and sound mixed with battle scenes for more interest although it could have been better had it been longer so that there would be more development.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation: Would recommend it, however not as a must-watch anime.",

Though as watch more this will bother you less and less till the point you don't notice anything wrong with it. The Main characters have been developedwell, the supporting cast is really strong and may as well be mains. \\n\\n\r\nAn anime that at first glance may seem like it would become a harem but it doesn't and though this may seem disappointing for some it actually develops quite nicely all the characters have their reasons for their actions and they are'nt all after our protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound has been done well all the voice acting is great, the sound effects for all the naval battles meet 'quality standards' as to say, I'm sure you would have heard them elsewhere. \\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed the anime and personally feel there is room for a season 2 but the season closed in a way where it is not needed, Looking forward to the movie.\\n\\n\r\n=============================================\\n\r\nReview done in my usual category type: (for those who prefer it that way)\\n\\n\r\nStory : The story played out in this anime may not be unique but it has been executed very well, Lots of ups and downs and very little down time from the action. So if your looking for advance tech naval strategies this is the anime for you. \\n\\n\r\nArt : The art style is essentially 3D Characters, 3D Ships, 2D backgrounds (it seems to be I'm quite sure it is). The 3D characters threw me off a bit during the first episode as the characters movements seemed stiff and not fluent. Though its like they changed artists after the first episode and the art feels better after the first episode. 3D ships well personally I feel this may be the only way to get some really cool naval battle action and its very well done. \\n\r\nIndoors and basically when they are not on the ship the backgrounds are 2D the characters may seem 2D during these scenes as well. Messy start but works well as you continue to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSound : Great voice acting, Good sound effects. The sounds reach 'quality standards' as per say. Done really well I'm sure you heard some of the effects used in other things. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters : The Main characters have been developed well and the supporting cast is also quite developed and strong, They may as well all be main characters in this. Happy to say there is only one love triangle and the other girls have their own reasons for their actions. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : Personally enjoyed watching our protagonists solve problems and how all the naval action is done, The story was enjoyable to watch and I'm looking forward to watching the upcoming movie.",

            "content": "The sci-fi genre has never been better with the debut of Aoki Hagane no Apreggio: Ars Nova. Not to mention it is also apart of the action genre to make it much more of a power house. This is definitely one of the animes of the Fall line up you do not want to miss out on for an array of notable reasons. Intriguing story filled with mystery, action packed episodes that will literally glue your eyes to the screen in an amazement, incredible, yet refreshing art & animation and more. One could possibly argue it has the whole package, aside from few little kinks.\r\nStory- 8.5\\n\\n\r\nThere is definitely a nod to the older generations of sci-fi with all its glory of futuristic advanced war ships with laser beams and catastrophic missiles. Ars Nova is equipped with all of this. The series has a very intriguing setting to say the least, with many questions and  mysteries shrouding the plot of the story. As the synopsis mentions the world, of course humanity, is essentially underseige by an unknown enemy later known as \"The Fleet of Fog,\" which are futuristic,technologically advanced warships, that totally outclass the humans races cruisers. The protagonist is the last hope against these mysterious foes that inhabit the waters all over the world. As for plot progression and overall pace of the anime is very exceptional, not too fast and not too slow. No complaints here and it should very well stay like that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation - 9\\n\\n\r\nProbably the most notable thing about this series is the art style and animation. The whole anime is rendered out in CGI as mentioned in my blog post about my first impression about the Ars Nova. This can be a hate it or love it type of deal to many, however in my opinion this type of style looks fantastic and sometimes can hardly tell once involved and engrossed in the story & visuals. This gives off a new level of perception and how we view anime. How often do we get to see full CGI episodes? Some usual methods that anime today try to incorporate CGI for example are, slide of the camera in a battle scene (EX: Attack on Titan last episode), aerial view of an army (Kingdom 2, pretty horrible, yes I know), simple cars passing by (Golden Time), mechas in battle (Valrave) and so on. Battle scenes between these vessels of mass destruction are phenomenally done and are extremely exciting and engaging to watch. The color choice and vibrancy or radiance from the ships and missiles are beautiful and visually stunning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7.5\\n\\n\r\nThere are a variety of characters on this show, however the obvious highlight and focus here is between the protagonist and his companion. This type of connection reminds me of a variety of animes in the past that delve in the same type of scenarios. The duo certainly makes itself one of the more notable batman and robin type roles in today's anime. One that quickly comes to mind is Outlaw Star and perhaps even one of the more recent animes, Suisei no Gargantia, however it doesn't nearly reach as much depth as the for-mentioned predecessors . Character development makes an appearance ever so subtly which is good. Slow and steady wins the race. One thing in this section that hopefully gets addressed as the series progresses is making more time for back stories of the other cast members, rather than the spot light being on the two main characters the entire time. Getting familiar with each character and by adding depth to them really makes for a good supporting cast that can shine and be more memorable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWow Factor - 9\\n\\n\r\nAoki Hagane no Arpeggio is definitely a thrill ride worth experiencing whether your a fan of sci-fi or action. Each episode thus far is perfectly done and has a good mesh of different genres and elements. Watching intelligently, well thought out strategies unfold and take action really makes the action scenes very suspenseful to watch and literally being absorbed or for a lack of a better term, immersed in the action. Absolutely one of the better animes of Fall 2013.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Grade - 8.5 -> 8 (AnimeList)\\n\\n\\n\r\n+ Intense action\\n\r\n+ Stunning animation and refreshing art direction/style\\n\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend this series to watch? Yes, if you like sci-fi shows with battle ships, high powered lasers, war, enthralling action, refreshing art style, and with an intriguing story. Aoki Hagane no Apreggio: Ars Nova is definitely the one for you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Azure Sky of AniRaters",

            "content": "Some might actually say that this is an Harem style anime with efforts to bled CG into an anime along with some other factors lets go ahead and look at some points. Story itself is so far interesting in no way is the anime accurate to them manga so if you were turned off by the anime give the manga a chance there are a few detail that were missed. Art style was a bit hard at time to watch with the blending of Cg effects in with animation. Movements of characters at times did seem fluid and you could tell off the bat thatit was cg. I enjoyed the opening theme a lot and the ending theme the over all sound quality of this anime was decent enough a lot of the voice overs I did enjoy a lot. Character development was a bit wonky but once again not compared to the manga. Overall it was an enjoyable anime that had interesting points and also a good story to boot the idea that this also considered an harem  anime is far from it. The female mental models are not after the main character or even after Iona but they are what the AI thought that ships would look like due to the fact that humans humanize things like cars, boats and planes we generally refer to those items as \"she\" so I give the creator an extra point for that idea alone and my final verdict would be 7.1 score for this anime. Please do give the manga a shot its a lot better than the anime.\\n",

Post-Apocalyptic fighting for earth against an not very known enemy (Neon Genesis) but with cute girls on battleships and submarines instead of giant frightening monsters (Angels). For the sake of a fair review I won't compare the two series any longer. This series does art fairly well with CG (Considering I myself don't like CG too much). The action scenes seem fluent and the battles seem well made but some times it can be off disservice (When they are talking 1 on 1 it seems a little bit rough with the animation). The soundtrack wasn't thatexciting but did some of its job but other times I completely forgot this anime had a soundtrack. The opening song Savior of Song sung by the YouTube singer Nano who did an excellent work on this track. The characters are quite stereotype like with Iona who is the typical Kuudere and Takao who feels like the typical Tsundere. The main character Chihaya Gunzou is actually some what useful in this story and I feel I like him more then normal male protagonists in this genre.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the series can be given a watch considering its episodes only go up to 12 but do not come into this anime expecting something new because most of this show has been done before. I can give it credit for making underwater naval combat intense.",

            "content": "WARNING: Watching this anime will cause most other anime looks pale in comparison. Do not watch this anime until you're ready to set a new rival on your top 10 best anime list.\r\nAoki Hagane, or sometimes just called as Arpeggio, is a whole new level of anime, simply because of the daring, unique concept. Even in hindsight, it set difference among many other anime, also because of that difference. And that difference itself... is from the heart of anime itself; on its animation. Hence, anime is an animation.\r\nArpeggio of Blue Steel choose a risky yet audacious decision to uses 3D instead of conventional 2D animation.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, you might ask... Why it's that good? The visual isn't even that smooth? Definitely not as smooth as some next-gen video games or more high budget Hollywood animation movie...\\n\\n\r\nBut right on the first episode, you'll get shocked. You wouldn't expect THIS level of visual when you watch an anime.\\n\\n\r\nAoki Hagane brings you a total jawdrop and mindblown by just showing off their visual effect alone. The visual effect of this anime is superior than pretty much 98% of anime that exist out there. And no, don't try to compare the visual to SAO and alike. The visual of Aoki Hagane are STRONG and deliver it in full force, like a powerful shockwave, more impactful than any other visual effect than what (most) 2D animation can bring.\\n\\n\r\nWith the sheer difference of dimension alone, Aoki Hagane set a whole new level of visual.\\n\\n\r\nTrue that it's not as artistic as some other anime, as there's actually MANY anime with some gorgeous, majestic 2D visual. \\n\\n\r\n...However, when you ask any 2D animator to makes missile explosion and laser cannon looks as epic as Aoki Hagane, they can't. This is where 3D really send you its impact... Because they looks real. The impact is real.\\n\\n\r\nNow, not like I'm saying the 3D of Aoki Hagane is flawless. It's far from that. \\n\\n\r\nIt's great for sure, though there's many rough patches and stiff, awkward, weird 3D rendering that looks less smooth than the rest, and sometimes, the 3D kind of fails. However, overall, the visual of this anime still above what many other anime can achieve, and it will definitely going to blows you.\\n\\n\r\nNow, to more specific points....\\n\\n\r\n_______________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAlright... I praise this anime a lot, but I also very critical when it comes to plot, because I highly value plot of any stories....\\n\\n\r\nAnd Aoki Hagane isn't the best when it comes to that.\\n\\n\r\nHold on the tomato, people. I'm not saying it's bad. It's still pretty good, but really lacking in development.\\n\\n\r\nAoki Hagane start out with simple premise.... Humanity is in brink of destruction when mysterious futuristic OP af ships known as Fleet of Fog attacks us. No one can stops them, and we're powerless. Not the most original of premise. We heard many that are similar to this.\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist, Chihaya Gunzou (you'll hear people calls him with his full name A LOT more later), lacks a proper backstory. The only backstory that he got is when he meets his ship, Iona. That's all.\\n\\n\r\nThe crew of his ship also.... well, they got no backstory at all. They do appear on the flashback of Chihaya Gunzou. So they're basically just exist for battle strategy purposes. \\n\\n\r\nThe real plot is all about the Fleet of Fog, because surprisingly, even themselves didn't know who they truly are and why they exist. Unlike trying to search for the actual plot such as the Admiralty Code, we spend most our time with character developments.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm saying that the character developments of this anime is beyond excellent. It's really, really good, but we're talking about the plot here. And the plot is really that simple... Go to America, they said. It will be fun, they said.\\n\\n\r\nThe adventure and the battle really brings many enjoyment, hype and tension, and they mostly executed well done. However, the plot are mostly that simple. They just want to attacks or stop our protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nSo the strong point of this anime, is on it's character development... And this is where the plot gets twisted. Because when everything meant to go according to rules, but they get whacked with mysteries and new development, it means the plot thickens.\\n\\n\r\nThere's many \"superstitious\" aspect in the story in contrary that this is a total science fiction. The concept of Mental Mode developing human hearts, gaining ideology and free will? They're amazing.\\n\\n\r\nBut what makes the plot good? It's when all of this happens for reason.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that reason stays as mystery, despite the fact that they cover up lots of screen time revolving around this plot. And they did it very well. Simple plot, but all the characters developments are what to bring the twist.\\n\\n\r\nThe real shocker is really not just from the plot, but how the story goes. You may summarized the plot in simple words, but the actual execution of the story is truly, truly epic. It's honestly an amazing experience.\\n\\n\r\nSo, despite the fact that this anime lacks more complex plot, the story still developed in some wonderfully unusual method.\\n\\n\r\n_______________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nART: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you follows up from the beginning, you should know how this section would goes....\\n\\n\r\nThe art? Absolutely gorgeous.\\n\\n\r\nNo, not saying it's \"gorgeous\" in a way, like, Yuri on Ice or such anime.\\n\\n\r\nAoki Hagane did not practice artistic flattery such as those anime that pays so much attention to their visual. Instead, Aoki Hagane wins from its visual effect.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no additional \"cosmetic\" glittery or any filter or alike, unlike anime such as No Game No Life, which uses such cosmetic filter A LOT and in literally everywhere. \\n\\n\r\nInstead, Aoki Hagane wins from raw visual effect. Very raw. It's like those that you'll expect when you see a totally brilliant colorful sci-fi energy blaster. It's nothing cosmetic. It's as vivid, sparkling colorful as it meant to actually shows if this happens in real life.\\n\\n\r\nI already write about this a lot, but let me put this in emphasis....\\n\\n\r\nIn term of visual effect, Aoki Hagane wins easily against almost any anime, and can roughly win against 98% of anime that exist out there.\\n\\n\r\nThere's little of anime that can win from their visual effect. It's just so strong. The impact, the shockwave, everything felt so real. It's truly overwhelming, makes your jaw drop, and your mind melting, exploding into shards of nanomaterial.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's just from the special effect.\\n\\n\r\nIn character design, Aoki Hagane also did an excellent job. All the Mental Mode are uniquely designed. There's EVEN an update to the opening animation during the \"Savior of Song\" that shows that some of the characters actually got a new appearance!\\n\\n\r\nBut what makes their art truly outstanding? Of course, the battleship.\\n\\n\r\nNot saying that those ships, which looks like a pacific naval battleship looks visually appealing, but with all the visual effect? They're glorious. What truly makes them looks good is how the animator turn these old overused ships into an original, epic futuristic battleship. It's hard to blend these old ships with a sci-fi visual, but they did great on this one.\\n\\n\r\nAnd you'll see how truly great they are when they shows up their futuristic power. Oh, expect to be in total awe when you first seen a Super-Graviton Cannon. When the ships transform to some alternate forms, they also looks seriously dang spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to the visual....\\n\\n\r\nThis anime already knock you right from the first episode with how the Corrosive Warhead Torpedo works. \\n\\n\r\nThen the second episode with the Super Gravity Cannon.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the fourth episode will outright break your jaws with... No spoiler, just see it by yourself.\\n\\n\r\nI was in total awe-struck when I watched it long ago with my friend, who already finished the anime. He then said that \"Oh, Kongou will going to be far worse...\"\\n\\n\r\nI stops watching the anime because I only watch it while borrowing his computer...\\n\\n\r\nYears later, in 2017, I rewatched it, and this time I watched it until the end....\\n\\n\r\nAnd that final episode successfully destroyed all my expectation. It exceed my my standard. It's like that you knows the final episode going to be epic, but oh boi that exceed my everything.\\n\\n\r\nBeing in complete honest, I just finished the final episode, and I write this immediately as I finished it. So all those epic battle is still fresh in my head.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Aoki Hagane is an art of itself, coming from how all the visual gets far beyond epic in compared to many, many more anime.\\n\\n\r\n_______________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAlright, this section will be shorter than the rest.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of Arpeggio (no pun intended) is good. The opening is really nice and fitting to represent the whole series, meanwhile all the other soundtrack are all epic in their own way.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm actually being picky. Some of the soundtrack sounds ungodly epic to me, but some are mediocre or not that good. However it pretty much covered by some more superior, notable and epic soundtrack that really brings out the atmosphere alive.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending song by itself is not the best thing ever, but they exude much \"mood\" of the story. What this anime did, what we can compliment, is how there's TWO ending song, but they didn't uses it the way they meant to be. It's not the typical one-for-half-first-and-one-for-the-half-end of the anime. Instead, they're being really fluid (again, no pun intended) on using the music. They uses it depend on how the episode ends, because one portrays more happy, excited and hopeful theme, but the other one portrays something deeper, more emotional and sappy mood.\\n\\n\r\nReally, this anime did a good job on utilizing their sound, and it's not just from the music. Even the sound effects are great.\\n\\n\r\nWait, why?\\n\\n\r\nBy themselves, they're not that nice. But by looking up again, this anime got one of the best visual effect that didn't only looks visually nice, but all the impact felt realistic. You can really feel the strong blows on them. This, paired with a good sound effect, will makes them insane. After all, sound effect IS a must to bring such epic impact comes alive.\\n\\n\r\nAnd honestly, they did great on bringing all the battles alive with their music and sound effect.\\n\\n\r\nSure the music wouldn't be as emotional as \"Glassy Sky\" played in Tokyo Ghoul, but really, it's not everyday to see an anime did a great job at bringing a naval battlefield alive.\\n\\n\r\n_______________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf I didn't hold myself, this section would be the longest of all section. However I'm trying not to brings in any spoiler here.... Which is virtually impossible, because I need to tells you just how great some of the characters are, and they only get that great after the plot twist.\\n\\n\r\nStill, I'll keep this spoiler free. Or at least, I wouldn't imply it directly.\\n\\n\r\nNot every characters in Aoki Hagane are great. Most of the humans are less significant to the story and lacks any meaningful development, even for the main guy himself. There's definitely only few times when Chihaya Gunzou really gets a development.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, for the non-human? I honestly didn't expect much, but then boom, this anime blast through that expectation barrier.\\n\\n\r\nAll the Mental Mode of the Fog are so unique, so colorfully diverse, that it's so ironic, coming from those who claim (and insist) themselves to only be weapons, no more and no less.\\n\\n\r\nReally... At first, you'll only sees them as machine, as enemies, as target to beat. But halfway down the series, you'll gain such strong emotional attachment, that you don't want ANY of them to die.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this coming from a person who watches lots of anime, and often not bothered by the dead of the characters. I mean, sure seeing an important characters died would be a shame, but hey, it's all for plot progression!\\n\\n\r\n....Then Aoki Hagane hits you like a train, wrecking you whole. Even for me, it's really hard to ever sees them as weapons anymore. This anime did far better job at \"humanizing\" the non-human than many popular bestseller novels.\\n\\n\r\nYou see so many emotions, from those who suppose to be away from emotions. There's this SOMETHING that makes you felt happy about them. It's like seeing someone grows, opens up, and it just felt so real. It felt so meaningful. It felt so important.\\n\\n\r\nIt then goes to the point where you don't mind if they skewer the plot, as long as you can keeps on seeing these characters. And remember, I'm someone who always and always focus on the plot. To makes me able to reach this point... I don't think any anime ever successfully did.\\n\\n\r\nAnd going back to characters development....\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I want to review each Mental Mode of the Fog because each got their own strong point in character development. But I'll keeps this spoiler free.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, you'll see the sudden changes of Takao to be forced. But after you sees more of her, you can't help but to support her feeling more than even the main girls. Her ultimate character development is truly eyes-bawling, as she brings you one of the most beautiful scene in the whole anime.\\n\\n\r\nKirishima and Haruna are those who you thought to be \"dang their character development looks so nice, I wish they last for more than just one episode\" and the grants that. They're the first to truly be human, truly be kind, which is a big thing to see on this anime. \\n\\n\r\nHyuuga is the first to appear in... well, different format than the other Mental Mode. It's not even about difference in her Mental Mode, but it based on her role and her... current ship's condition. Her personality makes us can't help but feel that she's those who actually truly understand human psychology and emotions worked, even to point of fully functional in her ego as well.\\n\\n\r\nMaya... You wouldn't see it coming when they reveal her true role.\\n\\n\r\nThe twin \"sister\" of Iona also surprisingly get important near later end of the anime. At first we thought they'll be just a plain, ordinary spy ship, but even them shows character development as well.\\n\\n\r\nThen Kongou.... I can't help but to speak this a lot; Kongou is great. She's among many characters that truly brings you attachment to this anime. \\n\\n\r\nNo spoiler, of course, but you really wouldn't expect Kongou to turned the way she is. You'll expect her to be just like those badass evil big bad guy character archetype, but nope, you're all wrong. This anime do MORE than humanizing her. This anime hits you with gigatons of feels train.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, I think she got one of the best personality. This is mainly because I can relate with her so much, and it's VERY rare for me to ever relate to the villain. Really, I sympathize and empathize with her so quickly, it amaze me. This anime do it in no way ever to call it predictable. Her character development is like a sharp sword that hits from nowhere, but it felt just so natural and... you just care for it so much.\\n\\n\r\nOkay but seriously, Kongou is great. You'll reached to a point where you'll feel bad for her more than to any other characters around.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, to our heroine... Iona got quite of development, and it begins from where she start to shows her free will, then her emotions develops too. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes her development rivals on Kongou because she originally so robotic, so much sounds not human. She sounds artificial. And to see this anime brings her \"alive\" felt like no other. Her development never forced, and she still sounds emotionless at many time, but if you think with your heart, you'll see many times when her heart begins to develops, and again, what amazing is that none of her development ever forced. It's subtle and really smooth.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, anyway, the character development of the Mental Mode of Fog covers the failure of this anime to brings a prominent human character.\\n\\n\r\nNormally we'll go with 9/10 since the crew of Chihaya Gunzou seriously lacks a development, but the greatness of many of the non-human adds one bonus point here, as it exceed our maximum expectation.\\n\\n\r\n_______________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI'll be brief here. Aoki Hagane is truly enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nIf I can say, Aoki Hagane is an outstanding experience like no others. It's really eye opening, inspiring, changing. There's just some emotional hook that makes you really attached, that makes you really appreciate and love this anime, the characters, the battles, everything.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who loves shonen anime, Aoki Hagane wouldn't disappoint you. It's not like some boring realistic naval battles, but it also not goes to point of unrealistic shonen physic woosh woosh. It balance things nicely and still manage to makes it looks epic as heck.\\n\\n\r\nTruly, the battle is amazing. The design also remarkable. The characters are outstanding and they really did excellent job at some of them. The plot is simple but you just really wouldn't expect many of the twist, as the main plot is so plain, but HOW to reached that destination brings you so much unexpected outcomes.\\n\\n\r\nAoki Hagane can be said as one of the greatest anime, and while it's definitely not the greatest, it still got so much quality in many aspect that you'll enjoy. It's really an entertainment that worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no slight regret after watching this anime. There's not even that \"empty void\" that happens after watching many great shows. Aoki Hagane somehow manage to keeps up your hype until the end, makes you demand a second season, but it didn't makes you felt down. It makes you attached but you didn't feel like losing something after you finished it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's a big plus point on this anime, in factor of enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nThough of course, taste vary. Some of you might dislike those futuristic battleship, or the characters, or the actions. However generally, all of them got such high quality, so if you got some nice taste, you'll enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\r\n_______________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAoki Hagane is a masterpiece. A hidden masterpiece among anime. Its so underrated, that it really shouldn't happen. It really didn't makes sense how Kancolle can be more popular than this super epic anime. Aoki Hagane got way more quality in everything. It's so to see this anime get little attention. It's really an underrated gem.\\n\\n\r\nIf you think on watching Aoki Hagane, you should try to watch the first episode. You think it's epic enough? Go to the second episode. Get blown by that? Keeps on until the fourth episode. If the fourth episode completely melt your brain with awesomeness, then continue until the end.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Aoki Hagane is not flawlessly perfect. While I see that many people praise this anime with good review, it's not a perfect gem. There's many flaws, even on its strong points. However, the overall greatness, quality, and uniqueness keeps on making this anime stays on high rank, and makes it more special than hundreds other anime around.\\n\\n\r\nFor me myself, I honor this anime as one of the best anime ever. It definitely won't reach the top 5, but it's good enough to reach the top 10.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching Arpeggio of Blue Steel, arguably, ALMOST any anime becomes pale in comparison. The only anime that can surpass Aoki Hagane in level of epic-ness is of course Gurren Lagann. But not even Gurren Lagann can reach the visual quality of Aoki Hagane.\\n\\n\r\nStill, Aoki Hagane wouldn't beat world top tier anime such as FMA Brotherhood that already hailed as one of the best anime. Still, Arpeggio got the epic awesomeness and super fantastic sci-fi battle that lacks in more serious anime such as FMA, so that's a strong point in different sector.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual of Aoki Hagane honestly can only be rivaled by few, such as Puella Magi Madoka Magica. However this is simply because Madoka Magica is such an artistic anime that really focus on vibrant visual. Meanwhile Aoki Hagane shows just how epic all the energy blast goes.\\n\\n\r\nSo, there does many anime that can go around or even surpassed Aoki Hagane, but I still stand on my opinion to nominate this anime as one of the best anime ever, and that's final.",

            "content": "Overall - 8: I went into this anime with no expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised. When I watched it a second time I enjoyed it even more.\r\nStory - 6:\r\nThe story is probably the worst thing about this anime, that being said it's not bad, just nothing special. The main character has to deliver some sort of ship part to america or something, I honestly forget because it's not really that important. They don't exactly do a good job explaining why this is important, but I'm fine with just accepting that it is.\r\nThe world building is decent, I like the flooded dystopia they made, butthe viewer is expected to just accept that super advanced sentient ships just kina appeared. One of the things I like is how this show explains some of the details of the world. Questions like \"Why are all the ship's mental models female?\" or \"Why does Oribe Sou wear a mask?\" are all given 1 sentence responses that felt humorous or sufficient.\\n\\n\r\nOther times questions that are pretty important never get answered, most of these have to do with the fog. Where they come from, why they exist, and how they function are left a mystery for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nNot every episode is amazing, but more often than not there is something to like, and when an episode is good it really hits it out of the park.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you understand more of what the fog are it kinda takes away the impact from some scenes later in the series, and this is definitely a flaw with the way they set those scenes up.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9:\\n\r\nThey use 3d models, this looks weird at first, but it allows them to get scenes where the effects and models blend together beautifully. It's not perfect, especially with the characters, but I think it's a nice to see something different once and awhile.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10:\\n\r\nThe opening is one of my favorite songs. The OST has some great tracks on it, and the sound effects for the fight scenes are great as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8:\\n\r\nSome of the characters feel kinda generic and overdone, but there are a handful of really special characters that are written beautifully, particularly the main antagonist of the series. The side characters are also enjoyable and have enough depth to them to not feel flat without too much focus needing to be put on fleshing out their character.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the problems the show does face is having a generic teenage main character who is fawned over by many of the other characters. The way they explain it is decent, but that doesn't mean that it isn't an overused character trope.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I feel is overdone the most is probably the whole \"human emotions are pointless\" thing that the fog deal with, but they handle it really well, and it works for the story, which is why this section isn't rated lower.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9:\\n\r\nLike I said before, I liked it the first time I watched it and liked it even more the second time I watched it. The final battle is also one of the better fight scenes I've seen. It's beautiful to look at and the build up to it is done really well. The twist that really sets it in motion is also one of my favorite scenes in anime. It's unexpected, heart wrenching, and its result is great.",

            "content": "Arpeggio of Blue Steel is a pretty awful show that scammed me into watching it through all the way with a promise on a supernatural-political plot that was barely advanced over the course of the whole season.\r\nStory\r\nThe promise of an interesting plot is the best reason to watch this show. Good hooks are established, such as \"What is the Fog?\", \"What happened to the world\", \"What is the government hiding?\". At the risk of spoilers, you never get to find out because these concepts are all hucked out the window promptly to facilitate a cringe-worthy harem fantasy. All events are more or less created toprop up this circus act and have no actual pertinence to the larger questions of the world. It's tempting to give the story a 2 or 3, since it did establish some intrigue for me, but honestly, I'd rather it didn't since it delivered on NONE of it, so it gets a 1. There's no reason for anything that happens other than wetting anthro-battleship panties for Gunzou, and god knows he needs the help since he has the personality of uncooked rice. Which brings us to...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nPathetic. 1. Lets start with the main characters. Gunzou is an obvious insert-self nobody who is chosen by destiny for no reason with no personality whatsoever. He grows tiresome in the first episode and unfortunately spends the entire rest of the show on screen, boring the viewer to death. Go to hell, Gunzou. Iona is an AI loli. Even current day \"AI\"'s like Siri have more personality than her. She says everything in a monotone and, like Gunzou, every time she comes on screen, you can't wait until she goes away, and, like Gunzou, she never does. The rest of the cast... is actually characters who could have redeemed a 1 score if we didn't have to spend the whole show watching Gunzou and Iona do impressions of used dish towels. Kongou and Maya are a passable villain duo. Haruna and Hyuuga are actually a little bit funny. Takao is an obnoxious stereotype whose motivations make no sense whatsoever but HEY at least she's got SOMETHING compared to literal personality-free robots like Iona and her sub sisters and figurative personality-free robots like Gunzou.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nPeople rag on the CGI of this show, and all I have to say is that if that's the best you can come up with to roast this awful show with, you clearly weren't paying attention. In fairness, though, the awkward smoothness of the CGI motions really emphasizes how gut-wrenchingly bland and robotic Gunzou and Iona are to create the perfect storm of get these two inanimate pieces of detritus off my screen. I actually found myself enjoying the detail on a lot of the battleship mechanisms and the art made some of the battle scenes actually enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nJP VA work was actually pretty decent. Gunzou and the 3 submarine girls all deliver like monotone robots with no emotions, but frankly that's exactly what they all are, so spot on job by the VA crew. OP is a little bit catchy. ED is forgettable. Explosions and other sound effects are actually decent. I'll let it off with a 6.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nAfter you realize the main plot is going nowhere and you're going to have to stare at Gunzou and Iona being as boring as possible for the rest of the show, the show rapidly becomes tedium punctuated by a couple panties and some actual decent battles. I don't hate panties or explosions, but also demand more out of my entertainment, so I'll give it a 3. Maybe if every appearance of Gunzou and Iona was replaced by panties and explosions it could get a 4 but the show would still be pretty bad. My recommendation would be to just look for cuts of the battles from this show and images of the characters in their underwear and you've pretty much absorbed everything of value from it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show was a waste of time. The plot is a con and the show should have simply not even set it up if there was no intent to follow through with it. Even as an awful lowest common denominator harem fantasy it fails by forcing you to endure hours of boring pieces of paper Gunzou and Iona decomposing on screen instead of focusing on characters that, I don't know, are actually characters.",

            "content": "Ah, Ars Nova. One of my favorite show in Fall 2013 anime's lineup and definitely my favorite anime in the field of action genre. Despite the CG animation, which I really don't mind, it is one of the anime with good story even though it became somehow less serious after Makie's episode (e.g. Hyuuga being dere on Iona) but regained seriousness before it ended. And being a nano fan, I enjoyed Ars Nova's opening as well as its other OSTs. You can say it's a horrible anime maybe because of the CG animation and/or the story but one thing I can say is that ArsNova is unique in its own way and that what makes it special.\\n\\n\r\nNow, going to the story..\\n\\n\r\nSo what's Ars Nova is about? Well, you can say it's like Code Geass which has a protagonist that came to meet a not-your-normal-girl type and has gone to become like fugitives who is an enemy of both government and \"Fleet of Fog\" and encountered other Mental Models in the series. Besides that, another story in Ars Nova is how Mental Models, take Takao for example, have started to have emotions and feelings for humans like Chihaya Gunzou and with those traits, caused them to be \"defective Mental Models\" and become an enemy of the Fog.\\n\\n\r\nThose said, one might think the story is boring and bland but it is not. Well, there's few non-serious scenes like the Hyuuga thing but overall, it's as great as it gets. The battles, which the series is full of, are top-tier action in Ars Nova way because obviously, it is not like Reborn or Fairy Tail which have constant clashing and fighting everytime whenever there's battle but Ars Nova is more of a Code Geass type that has strategies in between battles. Regarding the being defective Mental Models part, there's nothing much I could say but as we know, things are developing and most of the time, copes with the environment they are on and that said, I think it's normal to them to develop such traits and be defective. And lastly, the ending. Like most endings, what happens after is short but well done. Overall, Ars Nova's story makes it worth a watch and clearly deserves a high rating.\\n\\n\r\nFor the art... Like what I said before, Ars Nova is full CG animation and probably many people would find it bad but in my opinion, it actually suits the anime well. That said, because it's a CG anime, the emotions of the characters are overall not that good as there were many times when they are emotionless and doesn't fit the scene but aside from that, the ships, the battles, the designs, all were superb and that's why I gave it a rating of eight.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to soundtracks..\\n\\n\r\nAs what you can see on my profile, nano is one of my favorite people and she's one of my favorite singers due to her capability of singing in both English and Japanese and with that, obviously I would say the opening as well as the fourth ending was great but seriously, it is great. The background music during battles were doing what exactly their job is and it is to give the action scenes more intensity and make it more exciting and great. Other background music is also as great as others and they compliment the scene well.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters, basically, the supporting characters like Kongou and Takao did get the most changes. I'm not going to say what change they had throughout the show but I guess those changes made the story flow. For our main characters, Chihaya Gunzou and Iona, there's not much development except for Iona understanding the humans and that's it. They pretty much stayed the same as well as their colleagues which didn't have that much screentime. With those said, I guess you can conclude that antagonist got more changes and Mental Models are one of the focus of the story (like what I said).\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, Arpeggio of Blue Steel: Ars Nova is one good action sci-fi anime. The CG art should suffice and this aspect is the one to decide whether you'll watch it or drop it but look at other aspects first before doing so. There are less serious scenes which make them breather scenes if you are having a hard time because of the actions that are happening throughout the show. The show was enjoyable at the very least. It couldn't be entertaining like other anime for it being only a 12-episode anime but I think it can be enought to show how good and enjoyable this show is. So if you are looking for an action/sci-fi anime, why not try Ars Nova? Trust me, it's worth as it is unique in its own way.",

            "content": "The premise of the oceans being blockaded by an alien force intrigued me enough to watch the series. Arpeggio can be described as a naval anime with a dash of harem thrown in. The characters and storyline are terribly undeveloped. The sentient AI are empty dolls and most of their conversations are abstract musings about free will, love, altruism, etc. Even the human characters are totally one-dimensional, including the protagonist captain. There are only a few rare scenes where the characters are allowed to be eccentric enough to be amusing or interesting; otherwise everyone is almost always emotionless. It doesn't help that the characters arealso computer-modelled. Their movement looks stiffer and more boring than regular 2-d animation. \\n\r\nThe question of the origin of the aliens and their purpose are not answered in this season so there's no satisfaction of solving that mystery. The CG animation is often flashy and occasionally pretty cool looking and the naval tactics are sometimes clever, but aside from those two points, there isn't much of interest about this show.",

            "content": "This series is a solid 9.5.  As it is criminally under rated here on myanimelist, I decided to round up rather than down.  \r\nI'm going to cut the book report/essay style of reviewing and cut to the chase.  \r\nArpeggio is a series that sneaks up on you.  At first, you think you are watching a typical pew-pew style anime with naval ships taking the place of giant robots or spaceships.  But then, when you least expect it, the series does a terrific job of exploring what it means to be human.  As the characters evolve and develop they beginto grow on you and by the time you feel the series was too short and you don't want to say goodbye.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a couple of weak spots.  The actual human characters are somewhat underdeveloped, largely because the series focuses on what most of its audience cares about, the ship-program girls.  The male lead largely serves as a foil for the female lead.  Considering the terrific job the writers did, however, this seems like more of a product of only having 12 episodes to work with and the need to keep the action and tensions up, so these are minor complaints.  \\n\\n\r\nArt is excellent.  I don't get why so many people trash it because it implements some CGI.  CGI, when done right as here, blends well with traditional styles.  Why does everything have to become politicized?\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're looking for something cool to watch give this series a try.  It's only 12 episodes so you won't waste much time if it turns out to not be for you.",

            "content": "Some shows are just so great and well done in every aspect that they open themselves up for what I refer to as 'cloning'. Basically, a show that's done amazingly and has a huge following is taken, altered every so slightly, and spit out by another person as their own. In some situations, it's blatantly obvious when a show is being copied. However, when done right, two shows can have very similar concepts and plot lines, yet still be vastly different. As is the case with Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: ARS Nova, or as it may be more commonly known, Arpeggio of Blue Steel.\r\nI mentionedhow this show was similar to another show I watched. In fact, it had only been a month or so since I finished that show that I began Arpeggio of Blue Steel. The show in question is one you may have heard of known as Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion. Now, how are these shows similar? Well, that's as clear as day and it was the one thing that kept nagging me when I was watching Blue Steel:\\n\r\n1) Main character is a dark-haired youth who spends his time at the start of the show moping about the current status of the world\\n\r\n2) The aforementioned current status of the world is bad, as some outside force is oppressing humanity\\n\r\n3) The main character is bestowed a gift or power that helps him combat the tyranny of this outside force\\n\r\n4) The main character rallies a group of teenagers to fight alongside him with him as their fearless leader\\n\r\n5) The main character uses their superb strategical skills to overcome forces that are far more powerful than he\\n\\n\r\nThere are other similarities as well, but those are the main ones that appear in just the first few episodes. And yet, for all the similarities they share, Arpeggio of Blue Steel is not just a carbon copy of Code Geass. For one, Arpeggio of Blue Steel focuses on the naval aspect of war, seeing as how the antagonists are battleships. Also, where Code Geass was a fairly dark show at times, Arpeggio of Blue Steel is much more light hearted, with violence being reduced to ship v. ship combat and blood being virtually nonexistent. However, there are also many negative differences. First, Arpeggio has little to no character development at all. There are some people that seem relatively important, but barely make an appearance. The show focuses more of the development of the antagonists than anything, leaving the actual crew of the protagonist's vessel to just be stand-ins and do whatever the captain commands. Secondly, the plot armor for the main character and his crew and any other protagonist is hugely overused. There is almost no concept of danger because the main character is just 'that good' with strategy. The last big thing that bugged me was that the fan-service was very, very overdone. I always say that fan-service can be a good thing, but when you have butt- and breast-shots of almost every female character in just the opening alone, it detracts from the serious atmosphere the show seems to be aiming for.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Arpeggio of Blue Steel is a good show. It may be similar to other shows to the point where my friends and I call it \"Submarine Geass\", but it remains a strong show that can stand on its own. With a very unique 3D-ish art style and a FANTASTIC opening theme, Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio is a good show to watch if you're looking for a break from something more intense, like Attack on Titan or Tokyo Ghoul.\\n\\n\r\nPositives:\\n\r\n+\"Savior of Song\" is a great opening theme\\n\r\n+Plot is interesting and easy to understand\\n\r\n+Good amounts of comedy, action, and emotion\\n\r\n+Animation is colorful, unique, and mostly well done\\n\r\n+Music is very good\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\n-Only 12 episodes in length (though there are a couple movies)\\n\r\n-Character development is minimal\\n\r\n-The 3D effect of the animation sometimes makes the show feel as if it were lagging\\n\r\n-The show is for the most part boring and uninspired for the first 5 episodes, though it does quickly pick up\\n\\n\r\nThis show is nothing special and is nowhere near a masterpiece, but it is an enjoyable ride that will keep you entertained for a short time.\\n\r\nAnd that is why Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: ARS Nova gets a rating of 7/10",

            "content": "What would happen if machines developed or were given sentient life? Would they eventually obtain personalities based on their surroundings and experiences, or would they remain the emotionless brains they were developed to be?\r\nThe story behind Ars Nova is unknown setting. We don't know where they came from, what they want, who made them or why some are helping while others are destroying. The story played however is no so much the journey that they make but is more so based around how the actions of humans, peak curiosity in supposed, emotionless  sentient machines. It plays itself out really well without itself predictable outsideof some action/battle scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt styles seem to be that of an experiment. CGI out the wazoo. Characters, large object, just about everything that isn't scenery or background is made with CGI. It makes everything animated run incredibly smooth but still lacks in a few places when trying to add emotion to the characters faces. However with the addition of cell shading, only on characters while everything else uses full shades, tones and gradients, they have pulled of the 3D visual effect really well without it looking like the whole thing was made in a simple program like MMD.\\n\\n\r\nSounds here and there can be picked out from common stock model sounds but with the vast majority sounding new, they take action scenes to a whole new level of excitement when combined with the animation style. Music is no let down either with the addition of music in some scenes makes them peak over the rest of the anime through its form of captivating its viewers with how well its placed and used throughout. Opening and ending themes are as well, like the animation style, seem to come across as experiments as seldom do you hear a large amount of both English and Japanese lyrics mixed together. It has three ending themes that it rotates through depending on how the ending of the episode played through which adds to elongated sorrow or enjoyment of the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development, or rather for this anime it wouldn't be incorrect to call it, machine development, seems to be the main focus of this anime as their mission is quickly forgotten to the viewers and the emotional factors between the ships and the humans quickly takes over in the spotlight. Some jump forward far too quick for comfort while others progress as a nice pace which makes for many pieces of humor when the two personality types collide outside of battle. Each character's rate of emotional development is played out precisely as it should however, so while you do have your token over dramatizers, tsundere's, etc. They all have specific roles to suit their own personalities\\n\\n\r\nThe  enjoyment factor for the anime can sometimes vary greatly in some episodes while in others will maintain steady, whether it be high or low, for a couple episodes at a time. Feels from light to heavy, can be found in some episodes and despite them being machines, make for really dramatic and emotional deaths. However when viewed from a broader perceptive, its difficult to say that the overall series was not enjoyable, as no two action scenes play out the same and out side of action, the humor is wide to cover all types and serious debates/talks are well thought out.",

The battles are what kept me watching it, because I know even though it is CGI, the graviton animations were lit.\r\nAoki Hagane tried a few things and failed at it, like trying to be seinen. This show is not seinen. It tried to introduce complex factors (like psychology and long debates over what constitutes human logic) and frankly, failed terribly. But that's not the reason I started watching this show. \r\nWhat it does best is what Kantai Collection failed at. Yes, actual ships fighting each other. The reason I upped my rating for thisanime from a 6 to a 8 is because the beginning of the final battle left that good of an impression on me.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are clique in a way, but there are some irregularities in their behavior that don't adhere to their cliques that its not really clique. These types of irregularities are what makes a human a human, and actually did it well enough to be the first anime where I liked all of the cast. And I mean all of them, even that basic too-high-for-you nemesis that stalks the main character and his troupe throughout the series. Yes I hated her, but the ending of the show was good enough to make me like her just as much as any of the other cast.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the animation is CGI. If it would have been reg 2D I would have been so biased I would have given this show a 10/10. There just would have been so much potential for warping the images just a bit to emphasize immense power. However, the CGI goes well with the ship battles. CGI works well only if it doesn't have to animate people. But at least this anime did it better than Berserk 2016/2017. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, a review is only a review and only so much can be said through words. I will personally recommend it just for the effects when the ships are firing the gravitons. The particle effects are lit.",

            "content": "The story follows a small crew on a submarine called I-401. The world has been destroyed by a fleet of marine military vessels known as the Fog. The main cast had come into 'possession' (I hate saying that, but it's the only way to describe it) of a Fog ship that had defected, saying that her only memories are that her name is Iona, and she is to find Chihaya Gunzou and obey him. The Fog obey the admiralty code, and recently started forming Mental Models, or human bodies that they can use to think, and feel. The story follows this crew, and their encounterswith mental models of the Fog, usually battles. It has a few themes, but one of them seems to be along the lines of free will and fate.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a ten, not because of just having amazing visuals, but also because this anime is an extremely good example of well done 3D animation in anime. I know a lot of people get turned off by 3D animation, but that's because it's usually never done well. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound isn't godly, but it's pretty damn good. I love the openings and the endings. Shocker, I know, that an anime did well on both.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all seem to be very distinct from one another. Although, we never delve into the main crew's backstory, and they're more or less not a focus on them besides Iona and Gunzou, there's good character development for a 12 episode series. Just... elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nI heavily enjoyed this series. I think the reason for watching this is somewhere along the lines of emotion, and philosophy. The show, while never directly stating it, goes through a few philosophical ideas, and delves pretty deep into it. Not through exposition, but through the emotions it puts the viewer through. I remember watching the last episode for the first time, and feeling the horror. But as I progressed through it, I actually felt sorry for the villain. I won't go into details, but the reason for watching this is 'I want to see action. I want to feel. And I want to think 'what makes us human?''",

            "content": "Arpeggio of Blue Steel is an interesting concept on paper--a fleet of mysterious super-powerful warships appears on all of Earth's major bodies of water, and after crushing the world's navies, blockades every nation cutting them off from one another.\r\nA story setup like this when done right could actually be incredibly interesting.  What happens to an island nation like Japan when they are forced to live local again?  What happens to a nation like China that still relies heavily on seafood?  What about a super far flung nation like Australia?\r\nI was expecting an interesting story, but what I got was, unfortunately, a magicgirl harem anime.  You see, in Arpeggio, each ship has its own \"mental model,\" a physical manifestation of the ships AI.  As these mental models come in contact with humans, they begin to question their purpose.  Even this could be a good setup, but it is heavily reduced to just another bland harem anime.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I like some harem anime.  I enjoyed Highschool of the Dead, I loved Gate, and Princess Lover also had amazing characters.  But Arpeggio is just bland overall.  The interesting backstory is never explained.  The characters are never developed.  And everyone has like one personality trait, even the humans, that they never go beyond.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is similarly bad.  The entire anime is CGI, and not good CGI.  The CGI is similar to the low-budget Netflix anime Knights of Sidonia.  But where Knights of Sidonia overcame is poor animation with superior storytelling, Arpeggio does not, leaving the entire experience as an overall disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nDo I regret watching Arpeggio?  Not really.  It was only 12 episodes long, and while boring, it was not excruciating to endure.  However, had I known what I know now about the story, I'd have skipped this altogether.  I want them to develop the world more, but I could take a pass on the characters featured in this particular outing into the world of Arpeggio.",

            "content": "Arpeggio of Blue Steel: Ars Nova is an interesting show in almost every way, even though that interesting nature does not always translate into being particularly good.\r\n\tThe most quickly noticable way that Ars Nova is radically different from most anime is the animation. It is entirely animated using cg, a decision that makes it sometimes feel less like a show and more like an unusually complicated tech demo. This is a very subjective parameter, it didn't really bother me much, but some people might find it distracting or off-putting. Watch a trailer, watch one of the trailers for RWBY (they share animation styles), and youshould be able to tell whether you'll like the animation for Ars Nova. \\n\r\n\tThe character designs range from uninspired, in the case of the main character or the female lead, to very evocative designs that succeed in instantly giving you a sense of who the character is, like the design for Kongou, one of the primary antagonists. A minor character, Sou Oribe, really stands out thanks to the iron-man style mask he wears, but besides a throwaway line about it being for allergies, it seems pretty clear that it was really just put in to remind us that it's the future. The rest of the characters in the harem (and make no mistake, there is a harem in this show) are not especially interesting, but they certainly don't hurt the show any, especially a character that not long after her first appearance ends up in the body of a teddy bear, which is used for laughs just enough that it stays funny. \\n\r\n\tNormally, vehicle and world design in a non-mecha show is fairly unimportant, but in Ars Nova, we have warships coming out of our nostrils. The design is proficient and very fun to watch in action, where the full cg really shines. It is a huge credit to the production crew that they could get the animation of the people to the level that it didn't bother me, because it meant that there was no uncomfortable moment where things suddenly become cg. The warships seemed a little over-armed, given the hundreds of missiles that get fired on top of the massive WWII style cannons mounted on the ships, but given that the cannons were firing laser beams, it wasn't hard to shut up and enjoy the ride, and my suspension of disbelief stayed firmly in place. The world design beyond the ships themselves wasn't particularly interesting, but it didn't need to be. Maybe a little bit more to emphasize how stretched an island nation like Japan would get if completely cut off from the sea, but again, the show simply isn't interested in a gritty world, so I can get behind the aesthetic decisions. \\n\r\n\tThe sound is average to good, with the OP being a highlight. None of the voice actors stood out in any real way to me, with minor exceptions to Manami Numakura as Takao and Yukana as Kongou, with Maya (by Mako)'s \u201cIt's a carnival\u201d being a painfully cute earworm. The performances are somewhat hamstrung by the fact that the female lead is clearly being directed towards a very robotic, emotionless performance for most of the show, which makes the moments where she was trying to break out of that difficult to take seriously or value as highly as they deserved. The term \u201cproficient\u201d seems fitting, while no-one sparkled, there was no member of the cast that dragged the show down either. Sound effects during battles were great, although I would have liked the filters messed with a little more to make it feel more like we were listening through layers of water. Also, missing out on a tense scene with an enemy pinging with sonar searching for the cast seems like a true whiff on the part of the writing staff, and a sad opportunity lost. The insert music is all good, with nothing standing out a great deal nor was there a moment where I wished there was music when there was none. \\n\r\n\tThe writing and story direction is sadly the weakest part of the show. The overarching theme of the show is the question of if the Mental Models (AI that are both part of the ships and independent from them) are, or even should be, human. It's well-trodden ground, and Ars Nova stays carefully within the path blazed for them by Ghost in the Shell in anime, Battlestar Galactica in television, and tremendously done in literature by The Bicentennial Man, by Isaac Asimov. The high themes are somewhat underwhelming as a result. The story is a rollercoaster of quality, with a strong beginning and a strong end, but a middle-section that both drags, and involves characters and storylines that are sadly extraneous. I liked the characters of Haruna and Kirishima, but their adventure is an unecessary sideline that would have been better spent giving more development to the main characters. Spend more time on the main characters, make the show as a whole better, and give Haruna and Kirishima (and their subplot) their own subplot, with room to grow and really matter in the overall narrative, instead of going and having their adventure and then going back to the main characters without really letting what they just did have any impact on the story as a whole.\\n\r\n\tThe show is begging to have massive fleet engagements, but sadly we are teased by the beginning of the show, which has several battles that promise much more, especially given the increasing size of the cast on the protagonist's side, but we never get a fleet on fleet battle, and I felt a little bit cheated by that. If I want to watch powerful teenage girls smack each other around, the mahou shoujou genre is perfect for that, giving me warships and then yanking them away is just cruel. \\n\r\n\tThe romantic arc (such as it is) fell a little flat for me, especially given the harem setup that really goes absolutely nowhere. The main character barely seems to have emotions, and given how busy everyone is with the plot, I can't blame him for not having time to manage a harem of warship AI, but again it felt a little bit like the viewers were being cheated by a clear setup without any dramatic payoff. The strength of anime over western television is the ability to have conclusive endings and characters that really grow and change, and the main character did not do this, nor did his romantic arc really have closure.\\n\r\n\tThe miscellaneous parts of the writing, like the comedy, went over fairly well, the jokes were well timed and rarely were driven into the ground (shakiin!). There were no cultural references that I found overly difficult to understand, and the subs I used (Horriblesubs) gave me what I needed to enjoy the show.\\n\r\n\tOverall, I thought the show was pretty good, even if it didn't quite live up to its potential. Cut out some unecessary arcs and replace them with more development for the main cast (and more fleet battles) and you have an exceptional show, but as is it's \u201cmerely\u201d good. A 7/10, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to turn their brain off and simply have a good time.",

The director of the anime knows pretty well about all military weapons and also about ships as well. Thereby the story is also one of the only and the best Ship-War animes i have ever seen till know\r\nConsidering the graphics and art of the anime. I must say that it is pretty amazing and request all watchers of this anime to watch it in Blu-Ray 720P qualityor 1080P which will give you the best experience. THe character designs have been dealt with the emotioality of the character, considering tako who is a girl with a shy behavior but represents a kind heart, the character design suits her very well, my only comment would be that if Haruhharu's character design would have been a little more different but then again its my opinion only and the other character have been dealt with properly\\n\\n\r\nNext coming to the voice acting and sounds of the anime i must say that this contains one of my favourite ending songs and the theme song is also great, the animations which make up for the anime is also great. Coming onto the voice acting it is also good, not the best of the best but it is good, the sound effects are pretty impressive as well condsidering the missile sounds and gun sounds. \\n\\n\r\nOverall there my final conclusion on this would be a great anime which all fans of military and ships would definitely like and also when you are watching make sure to grab some of your favourite food and sit back and out on your headphones and watch all the episodes in one go, your sure to like this",

            "content": "So, I start off watching the first episode, right into a battle and then it finally shows the characters.... But wait, I thought they were 2D?!? Nope, the next thing you know they are actually 3D model renders. \r\nThe 3D models are well made, and the style of rendering they went for is totally anime-like. Heck, If I decided to screen capture any scenes from this show, people looking at the still image would probably think it was drawn in 2D.\r\nI give props to the Studio because this stuff is hard to pull off.\r\nNow, as you should know, this is a battleship genre, which theyfight by having a well-known crew working to fight off enemy battleships. Examples are Evangelion or Gundam-whatever. \\n\\n\r\nThey WILL spew bullshit out, as in every battleship show, to create drama, such as: \"Oh no, only 94% for hydrocastric domination beam!\" \"We used up too much particle energy for another shield blast!\" Not that I mind it, I just wanted to poke fun of it a bit. It works though, trust me. You'll enjoy this.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem I have with the battle sequences was it's inability to create unique situations. Most of the battles were just trying to hide from radar, and hit with that OP missle that they got.  As of most battle ship animes, I always compare to Battleship Yamato 2199, because they do it right.\\n\\n\r\nIn Battleship Yamato,\\n\r\nThey used planet's gravity for advantage, they would hop on board and take over ships, they would even have a sniper using dimensions to get around, or send out fighter jets to attack the mothership. \\n\r\nHere in this anime, we have only a few clever usages of battle.... Which are either decoys or radar hiding.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the plot.. Be warned because this is one of those animes that uses FRIENDSHIP PROVAILS ALL!! So if you don't like those types of animes then you should stay away. \\n\\n\r\nMajority of the plot heavily focuses on the debate of whether they are similar to the humans or mean't to be doll like and serve. They will nail you in the head over and over with this.\\n\r\nYou cannot escape, and you wish you could.\\n\\n\r\nYou will see THE ROOM (that's what I like to call it) because you will see it A LOT. It might even bug you because they start going into THE ROOM even in battle. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are cute, the show focuses on mostly only the cute battleship transformer girls, and of course the male MC, but leave the rest of the crew out. No backstory for anyone really. Does it need it? I don't know but it could help.\\n\r\nThe ACTUAL crew have no development. Heck, might as well just call them college mates that dropped out, and leave it at that.\\n\r\nMy favorite is Takao, waifu material right there.\\n\\n\r\nThe music can get epic, but it is held back by the action and the seriousness of the show. You cannot take this show serious, therefore the opera epic music that they play sometimes doesn't really compare.\\n\\n\r\nThe 3D is interesting, but the problem is was that it sometimes looks choppy, or the expressions of the characters look dead and doll-like. This show gets no negative points for the 3D because it was a great effort and well-done, but we aren't at that age yet where 3D as anime can look good to our eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe humor in this show is a little kiddish, it reminds me of RWBY humor. It won't make you laugh, more like annoyed most of the time, such as that one lesbian chick that keeps up the same gags.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment-wise, I would say I got bored a lot because of the lacking plot, and of course, the power of friendship. The last episode was super animated heavy though, lots of eye candy there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nSidenote: This show will make you feel like 2D anime is 3D now. I watched the new Fate Stay Night and felt like they were 3D sometimes LOL.",

Now humanity's last hope lies in the hand of a boy named Chihaya Gunzou and the fleet of fog submarine I-401. \r\nI don't have much against this anime, the story is pretty striaght forward from the beginning and the sound and animation is solid. The action scenes are great, they'refilled with bright lasers and missiles flying across your screen and sometimes it gets really intense and sometimes I found myself inching forward in my chair and almost jumping up and down because not only am I a huge history and military nerd I also found the scenes enjoying to watch, the happy scenes, the sad ones and the funny ones, I found them enjoying to watch.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the thing that bothers me is the lack of character development. You know nothing about the main protagonist except that his father, an admiral of the JMSDF and went missing in a huge battle against the fleet of fog and same goes for the entire crew of the I-401. \\n\\n\r\nI suggest you watch the first 3 episodes of the anime and decide whether you like it or not, unless you're like me and is willing to watch anything military related. (Also, if you're a hater of 3D animation I wouldn't put this anime on the top of your watchlist). But if you do like it then I recommend you reading the manga which will explain a little but more about the fleet of fog and the I-401.\\n\\n\r\nI'm Midway-Madness and thank you for reading this review of Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova. Have a good day",

            "content": "There are a fair share of Anime that revolve around ships, and this one is no exception. However, unlike most any other, the battles in this anime are done almost exclusively on futuristic Star Wars-esque battleships. And that's really pretty much all this anime has going for it. Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova, also known in English as Arpeggio of Blue Steel, is a very unique show, at least from a first glance. \r\nStory 6/10\r\nI'm not going to lie, the story in and of itself is very interesting. However, the way the plot unfolded was absolutely ridiculous. Twelve episodes was simply not enough timeto properly let the plot run it's course. There are so many things left unexplained at the end of the series that I felt almost no compassion despite the very well put-together final episode. Another problem I had with the story was our overall enemy the Fog Fleet. I like unique plots, but I really need a clear enemy, which the story does not do well. It tries to make us understand things from their perspective, but really it made me care much less about defeating them, which is the only real plot of the show. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation 8/10\\n\r\nIf this show has anything going for it, it's the art. the character designs are very detailed and unique. The main thing you will notice is that the show is done entirely in CG animation. This could have ended very badly, but the CG is done effectively enough that it is not as noticeable as you might think. While the movements of most of the characters look kind of awkward, it's the battle scenes where they really make use of the capabilities of CG animation. The Super Gravity Cannon, the decomposing missiles, and even the regular missiles were very detailed and fantastic to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nThe sound for the most part is pretty generic, and sometimes a little distracting from what's going on. The opening theme, however, is very good, and for some reason does not appear in every episode. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5/10\\n\r\nThis to me is really the breaking point of the anime. It could have been a pretty good series if the characters had been more engaging and realistic. Don't get me wrong, there was a lot of what they claim was character development, just not to literally anyone in the main crew. The Mental Models from The Fog change quite a bit, but the development feels very, very forced to the point that it seems they are becoming insanely irrational and emotional simply by being around humans for approximately five minutes. There was almost no development for the main crew, especially our apparently main protagonist Chihaya Gunzo, who doesn't change the slightest bit throughout the series. Another problem is not directly related to the characters, but the CG animation, though looks very good, does not allow for much in the way of facial expressions, which takes away from many of the most critical emotional moments. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment is a big factor for me, and while there were times I struggled to keep watching, Haruna grabbing her cloak and exclaiming \"Shakeem!\" (Shazam!) kept me pushing through. If you watch this anime without worrying about the plot much, it can be very entertaining when it wants to be, with the love-struck Takao and the energetic Hyuuga keeping things funny and interesting. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend you watch this anime for at least the humor, and the CG animation. It is also on Netflix, which is very convenient, and also 12 episodes long, so it wouldn't take much time.",

It open more questions about the logic of why ships instead of aircraft or why an advanced alien race would replicate world war two  ships then make the Captains all females that are a weabos wet dream. \r\nPros: Decent amount of battles, hot chicks, a different story line, above average art\r\nCons: Super silly girl crap, defies logic, largeholes in story.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not the worst anime out there but not worth spending too much time on.",

            "content": "Alright. If you are going to watch this anime, you also have to watch BOTH movies after you finish the series. You see all the people complaining about unanswered questions? The movies answer them.\r\nAlright, now for my review.\r\nArt style is great. While people complain about CGI in anime, the CGI in here is great. It is not like some anime where CGI kills it. The amount of detail is amazing. Since the show takes place mostly at sea, not much detail to see in the background. However, the foreground has lots of detail. For instance, the ships seen in the story are based off realships. Every detail is there from a ladder to the anti-aircraft armament. to a chip in the paint. Even when it shows characters in the foreground and lets say an information panel is the background, you can clearly read the information on that panel. The art is not mind-blowingly amazing, but it fits the shows well and is not an eye sore.\\n\\n\r\nPlot is great. People say the plot is non-existent, they are wrong. To be honest, it is a bit weak when you watch the anime alone, but when you tie in the movies it becomes really strong. Character development is strong. People say that the crew of the I-401 gets no backstory or character development while the Ships of the fog get more even though they are side characters. They say that is a bad thing. In reality, the show is not just about the crew of the I-401 saving humanity, but it has a Philosophical twist. The Ships of the fogs are basically sentient beings that can express emotion, but don't understand it. Since they don't understand it, they look down upon it. The Characters develop as they learn about emotions, and each character finds peace in a different emotion. The human characters, on the other hand, get very subtle changes, mainly with their view of the ships of the fog. If you like subtle character development this is a good one to watch.\\n\\n\r\nMusic fit the anime pretty well no complaints\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was a joy to watch, it always remained interesting and the battles always had unique tactics. By that I mean they didn't reuse the same trump card to defeat every enemy.\\n\\n\r\nI should warn you, if you don't like having a show give you only the barebones backstory to just tell you what got you here, then you will be frustrated with this. If it isn't important, you don't know the backstory. What matters in the anime is the present and future, the past is not important. All you need to know is who this character is and if they are friend or foe.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the idea is not exactly unique, it is executed well, but only if you watch the series and both movies. Even the first one, which shows highlights from the anime series for the first half with a small prequel scene, and then takes place where the anime left off when you reach the second half of the film.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if you like anime with some philosophical twist, character development that you actually have to think about and dissect, and don't mind watching this 12 episode series and  two 110 minute movies, you will like this.",

            "content": "Story (7)\r\nThe story is pretty original. \r\nIt touches on what it means to be \"alive\" and have your own consciousness. When this concerns cute girls that can control powerful battleships this makes it even more enjoyable to watch :) However, for all the consciousness they seem to possess, they can't get further than blushing next to the person they have a crush on. What they really are and where they are coming from is not answered in this show, which is a shame. Maybe this is shown in the manga, but since I believe that an anime should be able to stand on its own,I really feel that there are too many unanswered questions.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6):\\n\r\nI had the feeling they wanted to imitate the \"genius\" of Lelouche of Code Geass without actually giving him any real motivation for doing what he does. He happens to stumble upon this awesome weapon that decides she wants to follow his orders. He is simply a above average smart boy who wants change (who wouldn't want this in this world?!)\\n\\n\r\nThere was near to none background on most the characters, their motivation and except a bit for the harem girls there is not much character development. So in this area this anime seriously lets down. However, on positive note, I did enjoy the interaction between the (stereotypical) characters and I thought the dialogs were sometimes very funny.\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler!!\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------\\n\r\nThe best character of the show was in my opinion Takao. But as I could have seen it coming, these type of girls always end up as some sacrifice for the main character while having their love unrequited. Who in real life would ever chose the motherly, quiet, shy, weak, simple girl over the strong, intelligent, tsundere, feminine, independent woman?! Really, I don't know what's wrong with the Japanese men's taste of women :P\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------\\n\r\nSpoiler end!!\\n\\n\r\nArt (8):\\n\r\nThe battles were very nicely animated and it was quite exciting to find out what plan (read: awesome animation) the crew would use to defeat the enemy. However I'm really not a fan of using CG to animate the characters. It looked as if the characters were simply lifeless dolls that can be controlled in computer games.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6): \\n\r\nWas ok, nothing special, nothing memorable. The OP was nice though, probably going to be a tough DDR song >",

            "content": "I discovered this anime when I found an osu beatmap for the opening theme. I was drawn in by the premise--in the future, sea levels have risen dramatically, resulting in large losses of land for the human population. A mysterious army of sentient warships, the Fleet of Fog, emerges and establishes domination over the seas and sets up naval and aerial blockades, effectively cutting off communication between all landmasses separated by water. However, a certain Fog submarine, I-401, has defected to the humans for unknown reasons--the only command in its memory is to locate Chihaya Gunzou and obey him. Gunzou gathers a crew and vowsto defeat the Fog, becoming a kind of Batman-like figure: His actions are technically illegal, but nobody is stopping him.\\n\\n\r\nFundamentally, the story doesn't really bring anything new to the table: the future of the human species is in jeopardy, they are fighting against seemingly impossible odds, etc. Despite this, you can't deny that it makes for good entertainment. Plus, the submarines provide for dazzling visuals and marvelous battle sequences.\\n\\n\r\nThat brings me to the art--I know there are a lot of complaints about the CG, and I am a bit opposed to it as well. At times it just didn't look...right. It didn't look bad, but I feel that traditional animation would have suited this series much better than CG. Having said that, don't let the CG deter you--to be honest, most of the time it's not that noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nI'd say that Arpeggio's weakest link is its characters. We are presented with a rather generic hero: Gunzou is bold, morally righteous, and will always sacrifice himself for the sake of his comrades, yada yada yada. His only real motivation is to defeat the Fog, as for why he is so driven, we still don't know. The real pleasure in the character department is the \"mental models\" of the Fog ships--manifestations of the ships' consciousness in a human body (they also happen to all be female). The Fog ships have personality quirks that don't wander too far from generic action anime tropes, but nevertheless it's amusing to watch their personalities develop over the course of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Arpeggio was probably one of the most entertaining viewing experiences I've had in recent memory. The story is paced remarkably well, considering it only has 12 episodes. It features a very likable cast of characters that you can empathize with, despite their lack of development. The final episode sets the stage perfectly for a second season, which will hopefully expand upon the characters and story. I'm looking forward to it!",
