            "content": "For a long time now, the psychology genre has been dominated by the likes of Elfen Lied, Higurashi, Monster and Requiem for a Phantom. All these anime looked at psychology as the mindset of a murderer or the troubled past of the protagonist, and there were also shows like Death Note, which focused on the psychological warfare of two geniuses. This has been the way anime have defined the psychology genre for years.\r\nBut, as always, along comes a player that changes the way the game is played. \r\n Aoi Bungaku Series thrusts you into the shoes of the protagonists and synchronizes their brain to yours.It gives you a spectacularly detailed insight into their thoughts and feelings, all while following an intense storyline.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is the anime adaptation of several literary masterpieces in Japan (much like Ayakashi Classic Japanese Horror), some of them dating back to the late 1920s. ABS portrays six such immortal classics, each of them highlighting the complex and fickle nature of the human mind. Except for the first arc, each arc lasts only two episodes. Writing an in-depth analysis of each of the stories would be giving away too much and might ruin the experience. If you want absolutely no spoilers, then I recommend you do not read the MAL synopsis either, as it contains nearly half the story. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of the basic elements of each of the stories, while keeping the spoilers to a bare minimum:\\n\\n\r\n(NOTE: Each arc is a completely different story, are in no way interrelated and can even be viewed as a standalone anime. That\u2019s the primary reason why I\u2019m reviewing each arc separately.)\\n\\n\r\n1. No Longer Human \u2013 This classic, written by Dazai Osamu, focuses on a psychotic and troubled mind \u2013 that of a congressman\u2019s son. Set in 1929, this dark and gloomy arc was the longest, lasting four episodes, which proves to be more than enough time to let the viewer unravel the protagonist\u2019s twisted perceptions of society and how he bears the pressure of being crushed under the weight of his own ego. Drenched with sadness and yet pregnant with hope, each of those four episodes is memorable to say the least. After watching this arc, you understand why No Longer Human was the defining work of the author and the most read literary piece in Japan. \\n\\n\r\n2. Under Cherries in Full Bloom \u2013 Probably the most bizarre two episodes of an anime I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. Ango Sakaguchi, the author, tries to tell a tale of how people need to speak their minds in order to live a peaceful life. However, his idealistic approach on decadence falls short in this anime adaptation, because of unnecessary humor, inappropriate chibi animations and dreadfully boring jazzy songs.  The sudden light-heartedness and lackadaisical pacing feels like a fish out of water after watching the melancholy and sorrowful No Longer Human.\\n\\n\r\n3. Kokoro \u2013 Natsume Soseki is considered the Charles Dickens of Japan for good reason. I felt like I was drifting along in a sea filled with the characters\u2019 emotions. When I talked about this anime being the game changer, I was mainly referring to this arc. It weaves a bittersweet story of love, lust, trust, jealousy and friendship. \\n\\n\r\n4. Run, Melos! \u2013 \u201cIs it more painful to wait, or to make someone wait?\u201d The most straightforward story of the lot. The storyline is very basic and is about a playwright\u2019s life, as he spends his life waiting for his childhood friend to come and meet him. Once again, this was written by Dazai Osamu and is the retelling of a Greek legend (Damon and Pythias), the overall theme of the arc being unwavering friendship. As I said, it\u2019s a very simple story and it can get a tad predictable, but since it lasts for only forty minutes, it\u2019s an enjoyable ride.\\n\\n\r\n5. The Spider\u2019s Thread \u2013 What starts off as a brutal Assassin\u2019s Creed anime, ends up as a crude moral story that is far too short to convey any real message. While the basic idea of Ryunosuke Akutagawa was to entertain children with this novel, the anime adaptation is aimed at a much more mature audience because of its gore and profanity. A good story, but 20 minutes proves to be too short to convey the author\u2019s ideals.\\n\\n\r\n6. Hell Screen \u2013Penned by the same author as Spider\u2019s Thread, Hell Screen succeeds exactly where The Spider\u2019s Thread fails \u2013 it gets its point through in a single episode. This arc is about an artist and his struggle to paint his masterpiece, much like O.Henry\u2019s \u201cThe Last Leaf\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this show is one of the best I\u2019ve ever seen, if not the best. The show features some of the highest production values to date. It\u2019s also one of the very few anime that managed to use CGI well. The generous use of the morose red in the first arc, No Longer Human, was what contributed to the eerie atmosphere of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is great. While the instrumental pieces were fitting, the series doesn\u2019t have an OP and the ED was not very good. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as content warning goes, this show is rated R17 for a reason. Not only does it feature a large amount of blood, gore, sex and profanity, but it also contains strong messages about the society, which younger audiences will neither understand nor appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nBut when it\u2019s all said and done, Aoi Bungaku Series is not a show that will ever have universal appeal. Due to its complex nature and dark atmosphere, this show will most probably never see the light of the day. \\n\\n\r\n[ THE WRAP-UP ]\\n\r\nAoi Bungaku Series is one of the darkest and most complex anime out there. Not only does it show \u2018psychology\u2019 in an entirely new light, but it also provides an artful insight into Imperial Japan. Excellent animation and a strong soundtrack make sure that this anime is technically sound. Being an adaptation of six different novels, each arc is bound to have a different impact on the viewer, but maintain an overall consistency in the intensity of the storyline. Aoi Bungaku Series is definitely not for everyone and is made for a limited audience. If you don\u2019t like the first couple of episodes, then I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to like the rest of the series either. Those looking for happy endings or lighthearted storylines are not going to be impressed with this one. However, if you\u2019re in the mood for a dark, depressing anime about the world\u2019s cruelty and a gripping psychological anime, then Aoi Bungaku Series might fit the bill. Individual story ratings given below:\\n\\n\r\nNo Longer Human \u2013 9/10\\n\r\nUnder the Cherry Blossoms \u2013 7/10\\n\r\nKokoro \u2013 10/10\\n\r\n Run, Melos! \u2013 8/10\\n\r\nThe Spider\u2019s Thread \u2013 8/10\\n\r\nHell Screen \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9/10 \\n",

            "content": "One thing I have learned after finishing this series, that the world and its society is a one cruel place full with violence, madness, and betrayal, or in the other hand, overpowered by those with the authority.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe Anime itself is divided into 6 different famous Japanese literatures made by famous authors from the past and all of the arcs has no connection with the others, but don't let this make you down because those 6 literatures sure were masterpieces indeed. You may prefer some arcs over the others, but overall it was a roller coaster full of emotions. One has to think deeper toget the full and real meaning of each arc, or as an english teacher would say, you need to think outside the box. You wouldn't really expect what to happen next since it's like a train of irony. You will be left with awe once you finish a certain arc. You will most likely doubt your own instincts since at first you'll be like \"ah he's a bad guy\", but then later on you'll be like, \"wtf I was wrong.\"\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nIf I can give a number higher than 10, then I would gladly choose that number as Aoi Bungaku's art was a hell of a masterpiece. The art was one of the parts why this show was awesome. The art gave the Anime a mysterious atmosphere and in some part, creepy. Heck, I would be glad if all Anime were drawn like this.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nYou get different sounds in each arc. The background music that they play when a certain creepy event is happening was so good that it'll make either your eyes closed or wide open, if you're a masochist. Also, when emotional parts strike, the background music really helped to make a viewer sad or cry.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\n6 different arcs, which mean a lot of new characters. In each arc, you get awesome characters, and by awesome I mean characters surrounded with mystery and such. You wouldn't expect that character would do that to other character such. Also, 2 of the mains in 2 arcs looked like Light from Death Note. :D Plus, you get a 3d guy in every beginning of an episode. Where can you see an Anime with 3d people on!?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nPretty much enjoyed the entire series. There are 6 arcs so normally, one would prefer one over the other. Overall, it was really good. Superb, I must say.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nI would frankly say that this is the first Anime I've seen with a different type of storytelling so I'm going to give this a 10. It was very unique. You can't help it but fall in love with the arcs although in some cases, you will most likely hate some of the arcs before you prefer the previous one and wanted that arc to be longer.",

            "content": "Though the series hasn't finish airing I'll write separate reviews for each of the stories told as told in the anime shows that have aired in Japan:\r\nNo Longer Human:  Great.  In just 4 episodes so much was told.  One reason why people should watch the first 4 eps of Aoi Bungaku is because as odd as it may seem MANY OF US ask these questions at one point in our lives or another.  I don't want to spoil anything or what happens or transpires so I won't give any references.  There are several references to this title so it's difficultto say WHY it's called \"No Longer Human\" exactly.  If you don't want to watch a superpowered cartoon involving Super-Sayajin and BAN KAI or some wacky fairytale then relate to this masterpiece.  \\n\\n\r\nUnder Cherry Blossoms in Full Bloom:  Great as well.  In episode 6 there's even a Japanese version of Sweeney Todd's \"No Place Like London\" that was done beautifully.  The main reference between Sweeney Todd and Shigemaru is that Sweeney Todd was a barber who would cut the throats of his enemies he'd be shaving and Shigemaru actually decapitated heads as demanded or warranted by his new bride.   One thing that strikes to me as odd is the description of the \"demon\" in this 2 ep-long piece.  If you watch these two eps, please pay attention to the supposed protagonist Shigemaru as he describes his only way out of a psychological prison created by his wife.  \\n\\n\r\nKokoro:  Jealousy sucks.  That's all I gotta say about this story.  The story is given two points of view (most other productions try to give a bird's eye view of what character progression is).  I absolutely enjoyed both points of view as to what happened and it truly explains the shades and complexities of human emotions (regarding jealousy).  \\n\\n\r\nRun, Melos!:  This is a simpler story told about friendship.  Trust is the main theme trialed in this story as it's wagered between two friends.  There are side stories explained in the episode (the main character rewrites Greek/Shakesperian plays in to Japanese and these plays are acted out in the episode).  One main thing about this story (unlike the previous stories mentioned) is that there's no bloodshed.  Don't get me wrong, the story is just as effective without it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Spider's Thread:  Odd tale.  Simple storyline of a homeless bandit stealing & killing innocent people just to live another day (note kandata, the pro(antagonist) of this story isn't a greedy man).  This story got VERY interesting when his own path led him to a simple spider who in some weird way showed him that his future was only... well... hanging by a thread.  NOTE the following ep in the double-aired series is NOT a sequel to Spider's Thread.\\n\\n\r\nHell Screen:  Instead of a homeless bandit in the spotlight, an artist tasked with the mural in the King's future mausoleum highlighting only the good parts of his rule.  Many details revealed throughout the episode show otherwise.  If you think the king's beauty was appealing, feast your eyes on the shoddy prerequisites needed to bring his beloved land to prosperity.  \\n\\n\r\nWith all this said (I know I've prematurely praised the entire series as a whole) I don't regret my ratings as they STAY THE SAME.   Great show!  Well done in almost every single aspect besides the fact they ARE short stories being animated so there's  alot of thinking left for the watcher to do to truly understand the author's motives behind his/her characters' development throughout their respective stories.  Just watch this one any sensible anime goer will not be disappointed!\\n\\n\r\nThere is one story I'm missing on which I believe is episode 9 or 10 of the series.  I apologize in advance to all who've relied on this review before watching the series or any other episodes.  please note though you should FEEL FREE to watch any episode throughout this series as it doesn't progress from ep 1 to ep 12.",

            "content": "Overview: \r\nIf you have never heard of Aoi Bungaku, don't be ashamed. It is NOT a well known series at all. This is unfortunate, because in both popularity and rating it is one of the most criminally underrated anime on all of MAL. What makes this anime good? I will try to do it some justice and explain.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nAoi Bungaku is an anthology of stories taken from classic Japanese literature. The most famous of the stories featured is the short novel \"No Longer Human\" which is covered in episodes 1-4. The story is about a tortured young artist who as a child was sexually abusedby his maid and emotionally abused by his politician father. As a result, the narrator feels alienated from society and never reveals his true emotions to others. He wears a mask until he becomes hollow and dead inside and no longer considers himself human. He meets a girl who is also suffering from great sadness and they decide to commit suicide together in scenic Kamakura. This is one of the most famous of all Japanese stories, so perhaps it helps explain why so many damn anime take place in Kamakura. She dies during the suicide, but the narrator survives and is haunted by guilt over her death. He attempts to live as a normal human, but the guilt always follows him. When he finally meets another woman that basically makes him feel normal, he discovers that she has been sleeping with his boss in order to keep him employed. The narrator has a complete psychological breakdown and wanders off into the snow, already showing signs of advanced tuberculosis. The stories are masterfully adapted and help capture the psychology, emotion, and philosophy of the originals, even if some of the stories stray a little in terms of plot. At the beginning of each episode, a  narrator also helps by explaining certain aspects along with interesting facts about the author of each story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is absolutely beautiful in this series and the animation changes to fit the tone of each story. The colors and shades are dark in the first tale due to the depressing nature, while they are bright and vibrant during the fairy tail adaptations in episodes 11 and 12. Studio Madhouse is a very excellent animation studio and they are really at their best with this one.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEach story is well adapted and has a different style and flavor of its own. This keeps things interesting and fresh. If you are a fan of classic literature, than you will probably have fun with this one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nPeople praise series like Tatami Galaxy and Mushishi for being artistic, deep, true masterpieces of anime that abandon obnoxious anime cliches and have all the dignity of true art. This series fits that description at least as well, but has a measly 8/10 while those 2 series both have a 9/10. This is sad since I personally felt that the first 4 episodes of Aoi Bungaku beat the shit out of any of the Mushishi episodes and can match in quality anything from Tatami Galaxy. I'm not just giving this series a 10/10 because it is an adaptation of a classic. Gankutsuou tried to adapt a classic and fell right on its face. I'm giving it a 10/10 because it is a GOOD adaptation of a classic that has real depth and artistic value without coming across as annoyingly pretentious. That is really hard to accomplish, yet Aoi Bungaku pulls it off with grace and style!",

            "content": "As a huge fan of the psychological (mostly thriller) genre, this anime was a diamond in the rough.  I have not seen a series that did so well in presenting and going through human psychology.  Not only that but, Aoi Bungaku also takes a look at issues involving human morality.  The whole series consists of 6 works of fiction from Japanese authors.  On the surface the idea sounds dull as it relates with classic Japanese literature, which as we\u2019ve seen in multiple school SoL anime, are apparently a bore to read.  Though I don\u2019t know what the original pieces ofwork were like, I can say without a doubt that this adaptation turns these suggested \u2018boring\u2019 pieces of literature into something very interesting that will open your mind to a different perspective on human psychology and morality. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nI\u2019m not a huge expert on art, or animation for that matter (only expertise I have is grade 9 art).  But, even an amateur can tell that this series does a very nice job in changing its colour tones for each story.  Some of the darker stories such as No Longer Human and Hell Screen had a much darker tone and much darker colours as compared to In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom which had a more colourful palette in its creation.  These tones were the most prominent thing to me visually.  The character design was also very solid and matched the character personalities to a tee.  General art work and backgrounds were also very solid.  \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThere are no openings for this anime as almost each episode is instead started off with a narration, explaining the story, its background, and a little bit about the author.  I find this refreshing and unique as it gives you very useful information before heading into the story.  There is not much music playing in the background in the anime, especially when there is dialogue.  But, in the few instances where there is a musical score in the background, it matches the tone of the series very well.  The first series, No Longer Human, had much more dramatic and eerie music playing, in contrast to Kokoro which had more poppy SoL type music playing.  The OST for each series represented what type of setting/genre the story was placed in.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis section is hard because there are a lot of characters and in some stories they\u2019re main focus while in others they are not that important.  In fact, most of the stories focus more on the themes and the message of the story than the characters.  Because of the nature of this series, I will not do a character review section.  \\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot:\\n\r\nAoi Bungaku has a variety of 6 different stories, each conveying their own message and having their own meaning.  All of them are unique and interesting and I didn\u2019t find any of them to be below average.  I will do a rundown of my thoughts on each one.\\n\\n\r\n-\tNo Longer Human:\\n\r\nThe first piece of literature to be shown in the anime is in my eyes, the best one.  No Longer Human shows the life of a man, named Yozo Oba, who has lost all hope in his humanity and, for the most part, life.  It shows the inner thought process of a man on the verge of suicide, as he is disowned by his father for following his dreams.  You see how he hits rock bottom due to the traumas of his past actions and childhood horrors.  The author does a great job of delving into human psychology as it is shown how and why Yozo has completely lost faith in himself as a human.  The piece not only shows how sensitive and powerless we really are as humans, but also how society can make us this way with its generalized standards.   \\n\\n\r\n-\tIn the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom:\\n\r\nThis story is much more basic in comparison to the first.  It tells the story of a bandit who falls in love with a mysterious yet beautiful woman and how he does anything for her.  I feel this is one of the weaker stories as it doesn\u2019t really convey a message of deeper meaning.  Instead, it just shows how easily humans can be manipulated and used; the comedy also doesn\u2019t really help or fit in.\\n\\n\r\n-\tKokoro:\\n\r\nKokoro is another great adaptation, but goes towards a more slice of life feel as opposed to the rest of the stories.  The plot in this one is basically, without spoiling too much, about a love triangle.  Yes, on the surface it sounds very dull and out of place, but if you take a deeper look you can see that the story shows the struggles of suppressing human emotions and how understanding each other\u2019s (very powerful) emotions can play a key role in life in general.  On top of this, the story adds a twist by adding a second, non-canon, episode in the adaptation.  This episode shows the importance of perspective and really makes you think about the situation differently.  The episode shows the story in the perspective of what was deemed as the \u2018antagonist/rival\u2019 of the first episode.  I found it a very unique and necessary part, and without it I feel the story would probably be much worse.  \\n\\n\r\n-\tRun, Melos!:\\n\r\nRun, Melos! was another not so great adaptation out of the bunch.  Though it tells an interesting story about the importance of friendship, the message wasn\u2019t very inspiring or new.  The moral of the story was generic and mundane, thus I did not care much for this title.  \\n\\n\r\n-\tSpider\u2019s Thread:\\n\r\nSpider\u2019s Thread was an adaptation of a children\u2019s book with a very basic and generic moral; it wasn\u2019t very interesting as I have heard stories like it many times before except with a much lighter tone.  \\n\\n\r\n-\tHell Screen:\\n\r\nThis story is has a great message that could last forever and told in a very short and precise manner using the same type of fairy tale style setting as used in Spider\u2019s Thread.  The main point of the story was to show how art can fight oppression and help express many things.  Hell Screen shows how influential art can be and how loud it can speak to someone.  It also shows how a ruler having absolute power is corrupt and can ruin a nation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAoi Bungaku is a great series of 6 short pieces of classic Japanese literature with some great themes explored in them.  The art was very solid and added a certain tone that matched each story very well.  The sound, though lacking, was nice and the background music, just like the art, gave life to the story and matched it very nicely.  The stories were also a breath of fresh air compared to a lot of other shows out.  Though not all of them were great in my eyes, they were still well done and each had a unique atmosphere to them; none of them were below average.  The only major gripe that I had with the series that brings it down from getting a higher score is of course, the inconsistency.  By that I mean the difference in the stories and how some were much better than others.  Other than that, I feel Aoi Bungaku is one of the better anime I\u2019ve seen even though it can be a bit hit and miss with so many different stories.  \\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review ever. I was planning to refrain from writing a review, but now I just have to in order to see how many of you will find what I'm about to say helpful plus I don't have many anime friends so sharing it here will be the best alternative :P.\r\nFirstly, as far as the  story goes its divided in 5 entirely different stories, so each of them have a totally different feel to them. In my opinion, they tried too hard to be more artsy and create complexity but art already is complex and in Japan's nature they make profoundstories but they choose the wrong subject to illustrate that. Conclusively, some stories I was dumbfounded while the others were along the line of good.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the art, my God was it beautiful. If your the type whom will disregard the story and watch a series just for the art then you really should get your hands on this one. Since, Takeshi Obata, Kubo Tite, and Takeshi Konomi did a brilliant job, you can watch it just for that ^_~\\n\\n\r\nThirdly, when it comes to sound then a little to be said, it was fine but sometimes didn't fit the situation in my opinion. Moving on, the seiyuus were good, Sakai Masato did a well job seeing that he is a real-life actor. On a different note, it was a bit funny cause I've seen his movie before watching this show and I have to say his voice was the most distinct.\\n\\n\r\nFourthly, lets face it, it was too short to properly develop any character especially judging by how complex some stories were. So, the characters were left stranded due to the over-focus on the execution of the whole series, does it make sense?\\n\\n\r\nFifthly, enjoyment? To be honest, its quite a depressing anime. Thats why I watched 2-3 episodes per day whereas I would usually watch 4-5. That being said you be the judge cause it really was a bit heavy and hard hitting concept wise.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, overall it can average around 7 for, it has actually but I might change it in the future. It all depends on the effects it leaves on me after some time.\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to keep it short but guess there was just too much to tell.\\n\r\nHope you found this review helpful! ^_^",

Even though I had not read any of the stories these adaptations were based on , there was no doubt to me that they were masterful interpretations, whether they were honest to the original or not. I was overjoyed by this sterling example of what, let us say \"higher\" animation ought to be. Well, at least one type of \"high\" animation. Everything about  these adaptations is wonderful. Animation, dialogue, scenery, pacing, comedy, general awkwardness; it all culminates in a truly remarkable atmosphere.\r\nI havesince read three of the stories that were adapted: No Longer Human, In the Woods (or whatever you wanna call it), and Spider's Thread. They are all great works, especially No Longer Human in my opinion. I would even argue that Spider's Thread is much more breathtaking in the animated adaptation. Oh good lord, if you would like to watch animation at its best, please spend the time to watch this series.",

            "content": "\"Masterpieces are Blue.\"\r\n'Aoi Bungaku Series' (literally 'Blue Literature Series') is an anime adaptation of 6 Japanese masterpiece novels of 20th century, in commemoration of 100th anniversary of Dazai Osamu's birth (the author of 'No Longer Human' and 'Run, Melos!').\r\nThe color blue symbolizes youth in Japan. These works of literature are forever young, in context, the title of this anime series is 'Timeless Japanese Classics'.\r\nSTORY:\r\nNovel adaptations,\r\nEp1~4: 'No Longer Human' (Dazai Osamu)\r\nEp5~6: 'Under the Full Bloom of Cherry Blossom Forest' (Sakaguchi Ango)\r\nEp7~8: 'Kokoro' (Natsume Souseki)\r\nEp9~10: 'Run, Melos!' (Dazai Osamu)\r\nEp11: 'The Spider's Thread' (Akutagawa Ryuunosuke)\r\nEp12: 'Hell Screen' (Akutagawa Ryuunosuke)\r\nBeing true Japanese classics, every piece of original literature, otherthan 'Run, Melos!' are emotionally draining with tragic endings.\\n\r\nPersonally, I have only read 'No Longer Human', 'Run, Melos!' and 'Kokoro', but the setting and the way stories are being told are not exactly a straight adaptation, but rather more like interpretations of the original novels by the producers.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8/10\\n\r\nWith up to only 4 episodes per story, the character development is somewhat limited, but with most characters reflecting the authors themselves (or so modern critics analyze), most of the main characters are quite realistic and have depth.\\n\r\nBecause authors in early 20th century weren't paid very well, the writers of these masterpieces endured hardship in their daily lives. As such, the characters in their stories are often in despair and in various stages of mental breakdown, much like the authors who committed suicide and developed drug problems.\\n\r\nEvery arc focuses on the main character very well, and tells the story of how their lives led to their doom.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: 9/10\\n\r\nAnimation by Madhouse is wonderful as expected. No CG, tried and true Japanese cel animation worked very well on screen for these works of classic literature. The coloring is extremely vivid and breathtakingly beautiful. There were many surreal scenes that expressed main characters' despair, and artwork in general sets creepy, ominous, and dark atmosphere throughout the series.\\n\r\nSome scenes lacked details or were too still, but all the important scenes were done very well.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10\\n\r\nThe cast is comprised of insane amount of veteran seiyuu, and voice acting is generally well-done. However, the use of actor Sakai Masato for all main characters inevitably resulted in ill-matched voices, especially for 'Under the Full Bloom of Cherry Blossom Forest' and 'Hell Screen'.\\n\r\nMusic was very well done, each sets the mood for every scene, and noticeably different styles for every story.\\n\r\nED was somewhat bland though.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 8/10\\n\r\nI can't really recommend this series to the general Western audiences as it may come across as depressing, twisted, and meaningless violence. However, it's a must-watch if you are interested in Japanese literature or want to learn more about the culture.\\n\r\nThe anime itself is in no way a substitute for reading the original novels, but it did stir up my curiosity for the novels that I haven't read yet, and it also gave me an opportunity to learn more about each author.\\n\r\nEach story may not be entirely accurate compared to the novels, but they all convey the intended message and make us think. 'Aoi Bungaku Series' shows that the masterpieces are indeed timeless.",

            "content": "Anime being based on manga adaptions are very much common place, in fact, I'm not sure if I know an anime not based off an adaption. However, anime's based on old novels are very rare, and Aoi Bungaku is one of those rare types.\r\nAoi Bungaku (Or Blue/Evergreen literature) follows the adaptions of some of the most popular Japanese literature in the mid 20th century, and how their messages still resonate today.\r\nAs for the story, Aoi Bungaku is split into 5 arcs, one 4 episode arc with three 2 episode arcs. The last 2 episode can be left as either separate stories or together as theycontain the same characters, setting ext. Furthermore, the show contains a male narrator (or guide) who not only tells us about how the books came about, but the psychology and personality of the writers themselves, as well as their life stories. This gives vital information into why the stories can be so dark and why the characters are they way they are. In terms of themes, as mentioned above, the psyche of the characters play a key in making this a good series. From inner bouts of depression, money, suicide, murder and betrayal, some of these themes play apart in every arc. It's realism into the topic of suicide was very stark and informative. But with each arc, the story changes from friendship based, to the mythical and so on, so there is a good choice of different stories to choose from, as well as many different types of atmospheres too, some sinister, some emotional.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the main flaw of the anime is it's inconsistency in its arcs, some of which (especially the 1st and 4th) were done superbly, whilst the rest left much to be desire due to the lack of story development in the 2 episodes the arcs had. Nevertheless, the added introduction of the male narrator filled in a lot of the gaps left by the arcs.\\n\\n\r\nAs for animation, Madhouse did a brilliant job of making the arcs feel authentic to the genre it portrayed. From the dark and dulled down colours in the first arc to the bright and dazzling scenes in the last, they definitely spent no time making sure the animations were fluid. The character models all differed for the right reasons, which was nice.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the characters, it's a tale of two sides really. The character development in 2 of the 5 arcs are done brilliantly, from demonstrating how their backstory made their character, whether it be sexual abuse leading someone into dabbling with prostitutes, to a best friend betraying their trust, it did make for a spectacle to watch. Unfortunately, the direction of the other characters went off at a tangent, in the end, some characters were done well, others more shabby.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, for the most part, it was mixed in well with the different arcs, sad music for sad scenes, emotional music for emotional scenes, simple yet well executed. They're wasn't an opening song, as it was substituted for the narrator which was fine. The ending was a personal favorite of mine. Overall, the music was done to a good standard.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, Aoi Bungaku sets a slightly high bar for anime's based on real novels, but dropped at the final hurdle by keeping the a high standard in all the different arcs. I do recommend it for those looking for a new change to the psychological genre of anime.\\n",

            "content": "Aoi Bungaku Series is six works of Japanese literature packed into twelve episodes. Perhaps that sounds dull\u2014I mean, old literature always seems kinda boring, but this series presents themes of human morality and emotions in a very different way. Think of this as six different psychological, very short anime if you will, each one with a different topic to make you think about.\r\nFirstly: The narrator at the beginning. He's great, and there's this eerie background music playing in the beginning as he asks us to please watch. The way he introduces the authors' lives (...All of them seem to be very sad. I'm not surewhy.) and the topics is much better than any OP that could have been used. Unfortunately, the ED is really, really bad. It has a gloomy tone to it which does fit the series, but I dislike it a lot. The voice acting was stellar for each arc.\\n\\n\r\nNow I'll review each arc separately.\\n\\n\r\n1. No Longer Human \u2014 This, along with Hashire Melos, were my favorite arcs. The artwork is by Takeshi Obata, clearly seen by the way the protagonist (or antagonist?) resembles Light Yagami. No wonder that the art was great! Yozo's struggles with fitting into human society and the ghost that haunts him are all portrayed spectacularly. The music was gloomy to fit with the tone. I really enjoyed this one even though it gave me this weird feeling of helplessness after I finished it. 10/10\\n\\n\r\n2. In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom \u2014 The major problem here is the art. Don't get me wrong, it's great, but it didn't sit well with me after sitting through No Longer Human's realistic arc. The chibis come in at totally wrong time. But perhaps that makes the shock value even better; everything's so cute you never see the horror coming. Regardless, I give this 7/10.\\n\\n\r\n3. Kokoro \u2014 Different point of views, that's what this is about. On one hand you have Sensei who has had a cheerful life and looks at things in a different way, then you have K, a pessimistic man who has a different story to tell. First episode's from Sensei's POV, the second one's from K's. Really shocking to hear both sides of the story. Artwork is again by Takeshi Obata and very good. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\n4. Run, Melos! \u2014 How far would you go for a friend? Is it worse to wait, or to be the one that makes others wait? Run, Melos asks us these questions. This arc has the best artwork in the entire series, everyone's hair is gorgeous, and this arc was my favorite along with No Longer Human. Really sad.\\n\\n\r\n5. The Spider's Thread \u2014 Not as serious as the others but ultimately gives us a great ending. It only needed one episode to get the point across. Art was great and fit the tone of the story, as well as the music. 9/10.\\n\\n\r\n6. Hell Screen \u2014 ...Messed up, that's all I can say. It seems that the city is the same as the one from The Spider's Thread. And hell is indeed horrifying. 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nThough In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom is not as well done as the others, Aoi Bungaku provides us with a different approach to seinen. It could even get you interested in Japanese literature. If you like stories that make you think, here are 6 of them in one series. Definitely worth watching.",

I haven't read all of the stories that are adapted in this anime (I've read Kokoro, the stories by Akutagawa, and parts of Ningen Shikaku), but the ones I have read are portrayed very differently from what is actually written. For example, the adaption of \"Kokoro\" cuts out over half of the book and highly skews the way the audience perceives the characters. This series can be sort of dangerous to a western audience, that has no idea of what the original stories are about. However, the anime is definitelyfocused towards, of course, a Japanese audience (which are highly familiar with the stories and what happens) so the staff in charge of the anime has more flexibility to interpret the story in a way that is different from what is actually written. So main point: just because you have seen the anime don't expect that you can have an intelligible conversation about Japanese literature because what is presented may not be what the story is actually like...",

One moment you're reveling in darkness, the next you're watching a zany chase sequence in the next story. Truly the only thing that strings these together is that they are Japanese classics. They are not great stories though, the two I saw were fairly predictable if not painful to watch. At times in the very first story, it jumped so much in time that you were lost as to certain events, or why they might have transpired that way. Also, the draw in the more horror based ones seems to be \"Thiscould have really happened\". \\n\\n\r\nSo if you like horror, thriller, psychological, were intrigued this was so clearly linked to Death Note in the promotional art and cover and thought maybe it might cover some similar stuff then you will be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nThis series is primarily for those who enjoy Realistic Fiction, occasionally with Zany anime wackiness, as well as getting an insight into some Japanese fiction. It was not for me at all. The cover should not be a Light wannabe chilling in a gothic chair with an apple, since it isn't even reminiscent of anything displayed.\\n\\n\r\nHowever it is really well drawn, the music highlights the stories. That enough will be all some people care about, I know. Personally I'd rather watch a cheaply drawn 80s anime that had a great story than a well drawn 20xx anime with only beauty going for it.",

            "content": "*THIS ANIME CONTAINS TRIGGERS/GRAPHIC SCENES! PLEASE WATCH CAREFULLY!* \r\n~~~READ \"IN SHORTS\" FOR THE GIST \r\nThis anime is an adaptation of 6 modern japanese pieces of literature:\r\n~No Longer Human (NLH): (episodes 1-4) a rich student who wants to be an artist gets lost in his dreams and falls prey to drugs and alcohol in the mist of his depression \r\n~In the Forest, Under the Cherry Blossom in Full Bloom:(5-6) a mountain man falls in love with a woman who forces him to kill to fulfill her wants\r\n~Kokoro: (7-8) a scholar invites a monk (his childhood friend) to stay with him where the landlords are a motherand her daughter. the monk falls in love with the daughter. the anime shows both the scholar and the monk's side of the story\\n\r\n~Run, Melos!: (9-10) a young man and his best friend make a promise to meet but doesn't show up, influencing the young man to write a tragic screenplay about it \\n\r\n~The Spider's Web: (11) a killer on the loose gets caught and executed. he is sent to hell to pay for what hes done \\n\r\n~Hell Screen: (12) the greatest painter in the world gives up everything, including his and his only daughter's life for art\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 5/10: even though the pieces of literature were all made by the same author, the stories arent consecutive. No Longer Human felt drawn out to me and it felt aimless. Not sure if thats the emotion the series want to invoke but it did. Under the Cherry Blossom was my favorite because the pace was quick and the script commanded attention unlike the others. it was also very cheeky and had plenty of funny moments to break up the darker moments! Kokoro was a confusing little love story. It was bland with very little depth coming from the scholar (the main character). Run Melos! was a little above average in story. it reminded me of a love story that was touching but i wasnt crazy about it. The Spiders Web and Hell Screen were pretty good. it was dramatic, deep, intense, the color scheme wasnt the average dull colors. it was captivating to watch\\n\\n\r\nIN SHORT: No Longer Human and Kokoro were very dull, basically the same scenes over and over. No Longer Human seemed drawn out and Kokoro wasnt edgy enough for me (its a love story). Run Melos! was like a love story. Wasnt TOO crazy about it but it wasnt bad. Under the Cherry Blossom, The Spiders Web and Hell Scene were my favorites. It was dynamic, not too drawn out, right to the point, right about of edgy and gore!! \\n\\n\r\nART 7/10: the art was beautiful in every story. everything was drawn beautifully. the characters were very diverse. the animation was also pretty clean as well! there were no trouble spots either. if someone was carrying something heavy, it was accurately portrayed. the color scheme was the problem. No Longer Human was basically all one color. it kinda hurt my eyes and it made me sleepy actually. it didnt add the eerie touch it wanted to. Under the Cherry Blossoms, Spiders Web and Hell Scene were my favorite. vibrant colors, dynamic contrast, different background settings that kept my interest. they were just really pretty. Kokoro and Run Melos were average. Run Melos was a little better because of the attention to details but they were both decent.\\n\\n\r\nIN SHORT: art and animation for all were top notch. characters in all stories were diverse. No Longer human was all one color basically. boring, unappealing. Run Melos and Kokoro were decent in attention to detail. Under Cherry Blossom, Spiders Web and Hell Scene were my favorite. colors were contrasting, vibrant patterns, dynamic contrast, detail on scenery were gorgeous! very pleasing to watch\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 8/10: it was very pretty. the music seemed to fit the series. the motif of the ringing bell was a nice touch. Again Under the Cherry Blossom wins best in show once again because they created their own show tunes for that specific story and they were catchy!! it was eerie and oddly fit! No Longer Human had excellent jazz music that also very much fit the story and it was great. one thing that bugged me was the voice acting. for some reason the narrator voice acted the main character or one of the main characters in every story and he was terrible. very monotonous!! his voice only fit the scholar in Kokoro. there really wasnt any inflection in his voice that i could remember. also hearing his voice got tiring after a while. \\n\\n\r\nIN SHORT: the anime's strongest category. the music was pretty and it fit well. my favorite part of the series! narrator did one of the main characters in every story and hes honestly terrible. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS  5/10: i cant remember a single character from any of the stories except for Under the Cherry Blossom. they were all boring. Cherry Blossom had the most diverse and memorable characters. They had the crazy wife, the tough mountain man afraid of cherry blossoms, and all of his ex wives and their personalities! (they even had one wife who only spoke english which i thought was comical). but that story made good use of the varying personalities to make some moments light and cheeky, which was a nice break from 4 consecutive episodes of monotony, self destruction and sadness.\\n\\n\r\nIN SHORT: almost all of the characters were boring and made no impact. Under the Cherry Blossoms had the best, and diverse characters.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT AND OVERALL 5/10: every other episode i was contemplating dropping the series all together. I just really couldnt get into it. i watched and liked Death Note, and Japanese Horror Classics which are on the same lines as this anime but Aoi Bungaku just didnt click with me. I did appreciate the modern literature, but things can get sticky when you take modern literature, interpret it in a certain way and then produce it as an anime. you have to really have a specific taste in anime to get into this series. \\n\\n\r\nIN SHORT: the series wasnt bad, it just wasnt for my taste. i recommend this anime to:\\n\r\n~~people who have a strong constitution/like gore\\n\r\n~~like psychological animes\\n\r\n~~like historical animes\\n\r\n~~like/dont mind constantly changing plots\\n\r\n~~like shorter animes",

It features 6 rather enthralling stories, some being interesting retellings of folklore aimed for younger audiences, others being fascinating glimpses into the human mind, often the author's own. \r\nEach story is totally unique, well told and thoroughly enjoying to experience. My sole complaint might be the introduction sequences. While hearing a short synopsis of the novel's and writer's respective histories is indeed interesting, the cheesy sepia filters and sound effects made me groan more than once.

            "content": "Back when Madhouse was at its peak, one of their more ambitious projects was to adapt six classic short stories from Japanese literature with a different director attached to each story, minus the last two which were done by the same director because he chose to adapt the two shortest stories of the bunch and only needed one episode for each one. The only connecting thread between these stories is the opening narration done by some Japanese guy trying to evoke Rod Sterling and failing massively at it, and the fact that each adapted story is a depressing look at humanity's dark side and notfor anyone who gets their kicks out of watching The Brady Bunch.\\n\\n\r\nAnd when I say they're different from each other beyond those qualities I just mentioned, I do mean different. Different authors (barring No Longer Human and Run Melos which were written by the same guy), different characters, different styles, and differing levels of quality as well, and that's kind of a negative mark against this anime, unfortunately. I have to side with the popular fan opinion that No Longer Human is the worst of the bunch, and that stance isn't helped by the fact that it's the first story and it takes up 1/3 of the show's runtime, which is probably part of the reason why it looks so bad compared to the other stories to begin with. That said, No Longer Human isn't bad or that boring. It's just not very engaging for the simple fact that it's portrayal of suicidal tendencies across time is just that: a portrayal. They don't use it for anything ground-breaking or epic at all, especially when you compare it to the other stories. It's like Millennium Actress with a less interesting gimmick.\\n\\n\r\nFamiliarity with the original stories isn't a requirement obviously, but like with most adaptations, it's fun to see what gets changed for the better or for the worse depending on how attached you are to what you were first exposed to. This particularly comes to a head in regards to Run Melos, which only follows the original story about 25% of the time and the remaining 75% is devoted to the writer and how his personal life is reflected in his own fiction. It's a great use of narrative juxtaposition that complements both stories and their ultimately hopeful message regarding trust and the struggles humanity will go through to fulfill that trust. Although the fact that the director re-used the same artstyle and soundtrack from Mouryou no Hako was a little distracting.\\n\\n\r\nNot that some of the adaptations couldn't have used more loyalty to their source material. The second story, Sakura no Mori no Whatever, tries to pass off \"anime humor\" as a contrast to the characters' darker nature and it's simply awful. And I guess that's Aoi Bungaku's main fault. Aside from the differing quality in arcs, it saved all its best stories that actually examine its subject material in a mature manner for the end. The stories that are more phoned-in take up the entire first half unfortunately, so it can take a while to really \"click\" with some people. I honestly think the Hell Screen story should have been moved to the beginning of the anime since not only would it have left a much better first impression (holy hell does the final painting get me pumped up), it would have been nice for both the introductory and the concluding episodes to be directed by the same guy as some sort of show-capping nod. Not to mention, it's not even as great a story as The Spider's Thread - although I should admit that enjoyment of that one comes from how much bloody on-screen violence you're able to stomach in general. Fortunately, I'm a sick human being that can relish in that sort of carnage, but the awareness that I'm in a minority on that stance is larger than Godzilla wearing high heels.\\n\\n\r\nI hate to use the term \"it gets better, I swear\" to describe an anime, but regardless of my personal opinions regarding whether one story lives up to another, every single one of Aoi Bungaku's arcs deserves to be seen at least once, so the \"it gets better\" argument is more a side-bonus than something the show depends on. And it definitely doesn't need to, because the overall product is smart, risk-taking, accessible enough, and well worth a watch if you're looking for something beyond mecha, moe, and everything else that makes anime \"anime\", or if you're just a horrible human being in general. Wouldn't go so far as to call the show a personal favorite of mine, but the last three stories are definitely up there and they're stand-alone enough to the point that I can ignore the lesser aspects if I so desire.\\n\\n\r\nWell, everything except for Japanese Rod Sterling that is. I'm sure he's a nice man in reality, but his \"they're called evergreen because they're masterpieces\" catchphrase makes me want to reach into my screen and staple his mouth shut.",

            "content": "Let's be clear about one thing: Aoi Bungaku IS a masterpiece. Although it consists of six different stories, it is, nonetheless, a unified piece of art. The stories are connected via there deep metaphorisation, and through a sense of lingering despair intertwined with specks of hope and light. \r\nThe animation is exquisite; the artwork is truly magnificent and the enjoyment of watching an anime with this level of animation cannot fail to make you happy and satisfied.\r\nOf course, the animation in Aoi Bungaku reflects the depth of the stories, and the complexity of its characters.  Although I like to watch an occasional storyless seriesfilled with fanservice, series like Aoi Bungaku are the reason why I am so devoted to watching anime. \\n\r\nI don't think that there is a need for a close inspection of each of the adapted stories. There are enough reviews that do just that, and I guess everyone will have their own favourite. \\n\r\nIf you love literature (modern/postmodern) and if you enjoy a story which does not lay out everything for you, but makes you think, makes you wonder, you must see Aoi Bungaku. Sure, people say it's depressing and dark, but it's also fun and beautiful, and it does not make you turn off your higher brain functions.\\n\r\n I believe that the amazing contrast between beautiful and breathtaking animation and  dark, desperate atmosphere of the stories is one of the best achievements I have ever seen in an anime; it makes you marvel at the beauty of the world and shiver because of the darkness of the human nature.\\n",

            "content": "Aoi Bungaku is a series of short stories, all of which are based off of classic Japanese Literature. This is a very good series, but it has problems. Because there are six separate stories there is a massive difference in quality depending on the episode arc, so I will break it down accordingly.\r\nNo Longer Human (episode 1\u20134): This is truly a masterpiece. I don't know why they lead with this one, because none of the subsequent stories live up to it. 10.\r\nSakura no mori no mankai no shita (episode 5\u20136): The story was good, but I can't give the staff much credit for that, andit took back seat to mediocre singing giving it the feel of an overblown music video. More of the story would have been nice. 6.\\n\\n\r\nKokoro (episode 7\u20138): This one almost needs to be broken down again. The first episode is based off the novel. The second episode is from another character's POV. I liked what they were trying to do here, but I felt they failed. Also, the art got really lazy. 7.\\n\\n\r\nRun, Melos! (episode 9\u201310): Another really solid story. More lighthearted than the previous ones. This one has the same author as the first story, so I don't know if the staff was biased in his favor or if he was just the best author out of the bunch, but this one is another 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe Spider's Thread (episode 11): Really good, classic story. The portrayal was rushed though, and the conclusion was lacking. 7.\\n\\n\r\nHell Screen (episode 12): Really good story. I felt an episode about an artist should have had better art though. 8.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was a really good series, and I'd give it an 8.5, if I could.",

Aoi Bungaku, known also as Blue Literature caused in me wave of disgust than delight on epic masterpiece, which it is praised in every possible way.

First history called No Longer Human / Ningen Shikkaku, which was written by Dazai Osamu was literally zenith of everything. Some people search in it biographical conditions, but if that so, author must had ,,interesting\u201dlife. Peculiar visions, schizophrenic tendency \u2013 yes, it difficult to be bored.

If I\u2019m right, it something doesn\u2019t right, does it? What is in this era do all the technical innovations, known only our generations. We should write history textbooks another time. What\u2019s more, that woman was really\u2026scary. She tricked her lover \u2013 love is blind, whatever. Only positive? They keep a hog which can speak.

            "content": "For a long time now, the psychology genre has been dominated by the likes of Elfen Lied, Higurashi, Monster and Requiem for a Phantom. All these anime looked at psychology as the mindset of a murderer or the troubled past of the protagonist, and there were also shows like Death Note, which focused on the psychological warfare of two geniuses. This has been the way anime have defined the psychology genre for years.\r\nBut, as always, along comes a player that changes the way the game is played. \r\n Aoi Bungaku Series thrusts you into the shoes of the protagonists and synchronizes their brain to yours.It gives you a spectacularly detailed insight into their thoughts and feelings, all while following an intense storyline.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is the anime adaptation of several literary masterpieces in Japan (much like Ayakashi Classic Japanese Horror), some of them dating back to the late 1920s. ABS portrays six such immortal classics, each of them highlighting the complex and fickle nature of the human mind. Except for the first arc, each arc lasts only two episodes. Writing an in-depth analysis of each of the stories would be giving away too much and might ruin the experience. If you want absolutely no spoilers, then I recommend you do not read the MAL synopsis either, as it contains nearly half the story. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of the basic elements of each of the stories, while keeping the spoilers to a bare minimum:\\n\\n\r\n(NOTE: Each arc is a completely different story, are in no way interrelated and can even be viewed as a standalone anime. That\u2019s the primary reason why I\u2019m reviewing each arc separately.)\\n\\n\r\n1. No Longer Human \u2013 This classic, written by Dazai Osamu, focuses on a psychotic and troubled mind \u2013 that of a congressman\u2019s son. Set in 1929, this dark and gloomy arc was the longest, lasting four episodes, which proves to be more than enough time to let the viewer unravel the protagonist\u2019s twisted perceptions of society and how he bears the pressure of being crushed under the weight of his own ego. Drenched with sadness and yet pregnant with hope, each of those four episodes is memorable to say the least. After watching this arc, you understand why No Longer Human was the defining work of the author and the most read literary piece in Japan. \\n\\n\r\n2. Under Cherries in Full Bloom \u2013 Probably the most bizarre two episodes of an anime I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. Ango Sakaguchi, the author, tries to tell a tale of how people need to speak their minds in order to live a peaceful life. However, his idealistic approach on decadence falls short in this anime adaptation, because of unnecessary humor, inappropriate chibi animations and dreadfully boring jazzy songs.  The sudden light-heartedness and lackadaisical pacing feels like a fish out of water after watching the melancholy and sorrowful No Longer Human.\\n\\n\r\n3. Kokoro \u2013 Natsume Soseki is considered the Charles Dickens of Japan for good reason. I felt like I was drifting along in a sea filled with the characters\u2019 emotions. When I talked about this anime being the game changer, I was mainly referring to this arc. It weaves a bittersweet story of love, lust, trust, jealousy and friendship. \\n\\n\r\n4. Run, Melos! \u2013 \u201cIs it more painful to wait, or to make someone wait?\u201d The most straightforward story of the lot. The storyline is very basic and is about a playwright\u2019s life, as he spends his life waiting for his childhood friend to come and meet him. Once again, this was written by Dazai Osamu and is the retelling of a Greek legend (Damon and Pythias), the overall theme of the arc being unwavering friendship. As I said, it\u2019s a very simple story and it can get a tad predictable, but since it lasts for only forty minutes, it\u2019s an enjoyable ride.\\n\\n\r\n5. The Spider\u2019s Thread \u2013 What starts off as a brutal Assassin\u2019s Creed anime, ends up as a crude moral story that is far too short to convey any real message. While the basic idea of Ryunosuke Akutagawa was to entertain children with this novel, the anime adaptation is aimed at a much more mature audience because of its gore and profanity. A good story, but 20 minutes proves to be too short to convey the author\u2019s ideals.\\n\\n\r\n6. Hell Screen \u2013Penned by the same author as Spider\u2019s Thread, Hell Screen succeeds exactly where The Spider\u2019s Thread fails \u2013 it gets its point through in a single episode. This arc is about an artist and his struggle to paint his masterpiece, much like O.Henry\u2019s \u201cThe Last Leaf\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this show is one of the best I\u2019ve ever seen, if not the best. The show features some of the highest production values to date. It\u2019s also one of the very few anime that managed to use CGI well. The generous use of the morose red in the first arc, No Longer Human, was what contributed to the eerie atmosphere of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is great. While the instrumental pieces were fitting, the series doesn\u2019t have an OP and the ED was not very good. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as content warning goes, this show is rated R17 for a reason. Not only does it feature a large amount of blood, gore, sex and profanity, but it also contains strong messages about the society, which younger audiences will neither understand nor appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nBut when it\u2019s all said and done, Aoi Bungaku Series is not a show that will ever have universal appeal. Due to its complex nature and dark atmosphere, this show will most probably never see the light of the day. \\n\\n\r\n[ THE WRAP-UP ]\\n\r\nAoi Bungaku Series is one of the darkest and most complex anime out there. Not only does it show \u2018psychology\u2019 in an entirely new light, but it also provides an artful insight into Imperial Japan. Excellent animation and a strong soundtrack make sure that this anime is technically sound. Being an adaptation of six different novels, each arc is bound to have a different impact on the viewer, but maintain an overall consistency in the intensity of the storyline. Aoi Bungaku Series is definitely not for everyone and is made for a limited audience. If you don\u2019t like the first couple of episodes, then I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to like the rest of the series either. Those looking for happy endings or lighthearted storylines are not going to be impressed with this one. However, if you\u2019re in the mood for a dark, depressing anime about the world\u2019s cruelty and a gripping psychological anime, then Aoi Bungaku Series might fit the bill. Individual story ratings given below:\\n\\n\r\nNo Longer Human \u2013 9/10\\n\r\nUnder the Cherry Blossoms \u2013 7/10\\n\r\nKokoro \u2013 10/10\\n\r\n Run, Melos! \u2013 8/10\\n\r\nThe Spider\u2019s Thread \u2013 8/10\\n\r\nHell Screen \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9/10 \\n",

            "content": "One thing I have learned after finishing this series, that the world and its society is a one cruel place full with violence, madness, and betrayal, or in the other hand, overpowered by those with the authority.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe Anime itself is divided into 6 different famous Japanese literatures made by famous authors from the past and all of the arcs has no connection with the others, but don't let this make you down because those 6 literatures sure were masterpieces indeed. You may prefer some arcs over the others, but overall it was a roller coaster full of emotions. One has to think deeper toget the full and real meaning of each arc, or as an english teacher would say, you need to think outside the box. You wouldn't really expect what to happen next since it's like a train of irony. You will be left with awe once you finish a certain arc. You will most likely doubt your own instincts since at first you'll be like \"ah he's a bad guy\", but then later on you'll be like, \"wtf I was wrong.\"\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nIf I can give a number higher than 10, then I would gladly choose that number as Aoi Bungaku's art was a hell of a masterpiece. The art was one of the parts why this show was awesome. The art gave the Anime a mysterious atmosphere and in some part, creepy. Heck, I would be glad if all Anime were drawn like this.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nYou get different sounds in each arc. The background music that they play when a certain creepy event is happening was so good that it'll make either your eyes closed or wide open, if you're a masochist. Also, when emotional parts strike, the background music really helped to make a viewer sad or cry.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\n6 different arcs, which mean a lot of new characters. In each arc, you get awesome characters, and by awesome I mean characters surrounded with mystery and such. You wouldn't expect that character would do that to other character such. Also, 2 of the mains in 2 arcs looked like Light from Death Note. :D Plus, you get a 3d guy in every beginning of an episode. Where can you see an Anime with 3d people on!?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nPretty much enjoyed the entire series. There are 6 arcs so normally, one would prefer one over the other. Overall, it was really good. Superb, I must say.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nI would frankly say that this is the first Anime I've seen with a different type of storytelling so I'm going to give this a 10. It was very unique. You can't help it but fall in love with the arcs although in some cases, you will most likely hate some of the arcs before you prefer the previous one and wanted that arc to be longer.",

            "content": "Though the series hasn't finish airing I'll write separate reviews for each of the stories told as told in the anime shows that have aired in Japan:\r\nNo Longer Human:  Great.  In just 4 episodes so much was told.  One reason why people should watch the first 4 eps of Aoi Bungaku is because as odd as it may seem MANY OF US ask these questions at one point in our lives or another.  I don't want to spoil anything or what happens or transpires so I won't give any references.  There are several references to this title so it's difficultto say WHY it's called \"No Longer Human\" exactly.  If you don't want to watch a superpowered cartoon involving Super-Sayajin and BAN KAI or some wacky fairytale then relate to this masterpiece.  \\n\\n\r\nUnder Cherry Blossoms in Full Bloom:  Great as well.  In episode 6 there's even a Japanese version of Sweeney Todd's \"No Place Like London\" that was done beautifully.  The main reference between Sweeney Todd and Shigemaru is that Sweeney Todd was a barber who would cut the throats of his enemies he'd be shaving and Shigemaru actually decapitated heads as demanded or warranted by his new bride.   One thing that strikes to me as odd is the description of the \"demon\" in this 2 ep-long piece.  If you watch these two eps, please pay attention to the supposed protagonist Shigemaru as he describes his only way out of a psychological prison created by his wife.  \\n\\n\r\nKokoro:  Jealousy sucks.  That's all I gotta say about this story.  The story is given two points of view (most other productions try to give a bird's eye view of what character progression is).  I absolutely enjoyed both points of view as to what happened and it truly explains the shades and complexities of human emotions (regarding jealousy).  \\n\\n\r\nRun, Melos!:  This is a simpler story told about friendship.  Trust is the main theme trialed in this story as it's wagered between two friends.  There are side stories explained in the episode (the main character rewrites Greek/Shakesperian plays in to Japanese and these plays are acted out in the episode).  One main thing about this story (unlike the previous stories mentioned) is that there's no bloodshed.  Don't get me wrong, the story is just as effective without it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Spider's Thread:  Odd tale.  Simple storyline of a homeless bandit stealing & killing innocent people just to live another day (note kandata, the pro(antagonist) of this story isn't a greedy man).  This story got VERY interesting when his own path led him to a simple spider who in some weird way showed him that his future was only... well... hanging by a thread.  NOTE the following ep in the double-aired series is NOT a sequel to Spider's Thread.\\n\\n\r\nHell Screen:  Instead of a homeless bandit in the spotlight, an artist tasked with the mural in the King's future mausoleum highlighting only the good parts of his rule.  Many details revealed throughout the episode show otherwise.  If you think the king's beauty was appealing, feast your eyes on the shoddy prerequisites needed to bring his beloved land to prosperity.  \\n\\n\r\nWith all this said (I know I've prematurely praised the entire series as a whole) I don't regret my ratings as they STAY THE SAME.   Great show!  Well done in almost every single aspect besides the fact they ARE short stories being animated so there's  alot of thinking left for the watcher to do to truly understand the author's motives behind his/her characters' development throughout their respective stories.  Just watch this one any sensible anime goer will not be disappointed!\\n\\n\r\nThere is one story I'm missing on which I believe is episode 9 or 10 of the series.  I apologize in advance to all who've relied on this review before watching the series or any other episodes.  please note though you should FEEL FREE to watch any episode throughout this series as it doesn't progress from ep 1 to ep 12.",

            "content": "Overview: \r\nIf you have never heard of Aoi Bungaku, don't be ashamed. It is NOT a well known series at all. This is unfortunate, because in both popularity and rating it is one of the most criminally underrated anime on all of MAL. What makes this anime good? I will try to do it some justice and explain.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nAoi Bungaku is an anthology of stories taken from classic Japanese literature. The most famous of the stories featured is the short novel \"No Longer Human\" which is covered in episodes 1-4. The story is about a tortured young artist who as a child was sexually abusedby his maid and emotionally abused by his politician father. As a result, the narrator feels alienated from society and never reveals his true emotions to others. He wears a mask until he becomes hollow and dead inside and no longer considers himself human. He meets a girl who is also suffering from great sadness and they decide to commit suicide together in scenic Kamakura. This is one of the most famous of all Japanese stories, so perhaps it helps explain why so many damn anime take place in Kamakura. She dies during the suicide, but the narrator survives and is haunted by guilt over her death. He attempts to live as a normal human, but the guilt always follows him. When he finally meets another woman that basically makes him feel normal, he discovers that she has been sleeping with his boss in order to keep him employed. The narrator has a complete psychological breakdown and wanders off into the snow, already showing signs of advanced tuberculosis. The stories are masterfully adapted and help capture the psychology, emotion, and philosophy of the originals, even if some of the stories stray a little in terms of plot. At the beginning of each episode, a  narrator also helps by explaining certain aspects along with interesting facts about the author of each story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is absolutely beautiful in this series and the animation changes to fit the tone of each story. The colors and shades are dark in the first tale due to the depressing nature, while they are bright and vibrant during the fairy tail adaptations in episodes 11 and 12. Studio Madhouse is a very excellent animation studio and they are really at their best with this one.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEach story is well adapted and has a different style and flavor of its own. This keeps things interesting and fresh. If you are a fan of classic literature, than you will probably have fun with this one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nPeople praise series like Tatami Galaxy and Mushishi for being artistic, deep, true masterpieces of anime that abandon obnoxious anime cliches and have all the dignity of true art. This series fits that description at least as well, but has a measly 8/10 while those 2 series both have a 9/10. This is sad since I personally felt that the first 4 episodes of Aoi Bungaku beat the shit out of any of the Mushishi episodes and can match in quality anything from Tatami Galaxy. I'm not just giving this series a 10/10 because it is an adaptation of a classic. Gankutsuou tried to adapt a classic and fell right on its face. I'm giving it a 10/10 because it is a GOOD adaptation of a classic that has real depth and artistic value without coming across as annoyingly pretentious. That is really hard to accomplish, yet Aoi Bungaku pulls it off with grace and style!",

            "content": "As a huge fan of the psychological (mostly thriller) genre, this anime was a diamond in the rough.  I have not seen a series that did so well in presenting and going through human psychology.  Not only that but, Aoi Bungaku also takes a look at issues involving human morality.  The whole series consists of 6 works of fiction from Japanese authors.  On the surface the idea sounds dull as it relates with classic Japanese literature, which as we\u2019ve seen in multiple school SoL anime, are apparently a bore to read.  Though I don\u2019t know what the original pieces ofwork were like, I can say without a doubt that this adaptation turns these suggested \u2018boring\u2019 pieces of literature into something very interesting that will open your mind to a different perspective on human psychology and morality. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nI\u2019m not a huge expert on art, or animation for that matter (only expertise I have is grade 9 art).  But, even an amateur can tell that this series does a very nice job in changing its colour tones for each story.  Some of the darker stories such as No Longer Human and Hell Screen had a much darker tone and much darker colours as compared to In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom which had a more colourful palette in its creation.  These tones were the most prominent thing to me visually.  The character design was also very solid and matched the character personalities to a tee.  General art work and backgrounds were also very solid.  \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThere are no openings for this anime as almost each episode is instead started off with a narration, explaining the story, its background, and a little bit about the author.  I find this refreshing and unique as it gives you very useful information before heading into the story.  There is not much music playing in the background in the anime, especially when there is dialogue.  But, in the few instances where there is a musical score in the background, it matches the tone of the series very well.  The first series, No Longer Human, had much more dramatic and eerie music playing, in contrast to Kokoro which had more poppy SoL type music playing.  The OST for each series represented what type of setting/genre the story was placed in.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis section is hard because there are a lot of characters and in some stories they\u2019re main focus while in others they are not that important.  In fact, most of the stories focus more on the themes and the message of the story than the characters.  Because of the nature of this series, I will not do a character review section.  \\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot:\\n\r\nAoi Bungaku has a variety of 6 different stories, each conveying their own message and having their own meaning.  All of them are unique and interesting and I didn\u2019t find any of them to be below average.  I will do a rundown of my thoughts on each one.\\n\\n\r\n-\tNo Longer Human:\\n\r\nThe first piece of literature to be shown in the anime is in my eyes, the best one.  No Longer Human shows the life of a man, named Yozo Oba, who has lost all hope in his humanity and, for the most part, life.  It shows the inner thought process of a man on the verge of suicide, as he is disowned by his father for following his dreams.  You see how he hits rock bottom due to the traumas of his past actions and childhood horrors.  The author does a great job of delving into human psychology as it is shown how and why Yozo has completely lost faith in himself as a human.  The piece not only shows how sensitive and powerless we really are as humans, but also how society can make us this way with its generalized standards.   \\n\\n\r\n-\tIn the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom:\\n\r\nThis story is much more basic in comparison to the first.  It tells the story of a bandit who falls in love with a mysterious yet beautiful woman and how he does anything for her.  I feel this is one of the weaker stories as it doesn\u2019t really convey a message of deeper meaning.  Instead, it just shows how easily humans can be manipulated and used; the comedy also doesn\u2019t really help or fit in.\\n\\n\r\n-\tKokoro:\\n\r\nKokoro is another great adaptation, but goes towards a more slice of life feel as opposed to the rest of the stories.  The plot in this one is basically, without spoiling too much, about a love triangle.  Yes, on the surface it sounds very dull and out of place, but if you take a deeper look you can see that the story shows the struggles of suppressing human emotions and how understanding each other\u2019s (very powerful) emotions can play a key role in life in general.  On top of this, the story adds a twist by adding a second, non-canon, episode in the adaptation.  This episode shows the importance of perspective and really makes you think about the situation differently.  The episode shows the story in the perspective of what was deemed as the \u2018antagonist/rival\u2019 of the first episode.  I found it a very unique and necessary part, and without it I feel the story would probably be much worse.  \\n\\n\r\n-\tRun, Melos!:\\n\r\nRun, Melos! was another not so great adaptation out of the bunch.  Though it tells an interesting story about the importance of friendship, the message wasn\u2019t very inspiring or new.  The moral of the story was generic and mundane, thus I did not care much for this title.  \\n\\n\r\n-\tSpider\u2019s Thread:\\n\r\nSpider\u2019s Thread was an adaptation of a children\u2019s book with a very basic and generic moral; it wasn\u2019t very interesting as I have heard stories like it many times before except with a much lighter tone.  \\n\\n\r\n-\tHell Screen:\\n\r\nThis story is has a great message that could last forever and told in a very short and precise manner using the same type of fairy tale style setting as used in Spider\u2019s Thread.  The main point of the story was to show how art can fight oppression and help express many things.  Hell Screen shows how influential art can be and how loud it can speak to someone.  It also shows how a ruler having absolute power is corrupt and can ruin a nation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAoi Bungaku is a great series of 6 short pieces of classic Japanese literature with some great themes explored in them.  The art was very solid and added a certain tone that matched each story very well.  The sound, though lacking, was nice and the background music, just like the art, gave life to the story and matched it very nicely.  The stories were also a breath of fresh air compared to a lot of other shows out.  Though not all of them were great in my eyes, they were still well done and each had a unique atmosphere to them; none of them were below average.  The only major gripe that I had with the series that brings it down from getting a higher score is of course, the inconsistency.  By that I mean the difference in the stories and how some were much better than others.  Other than that, I feel Aoi Bungaku is one of the better anime I\u2019ve seen even though it can be a bit hit and miss with so many different stories.  \\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review ever. I was planning to refrain from writing a review, but now I just have to in order to see how many of you will find what I'm about to say helpful plus I don't have many anime friends so sharing it here will be the best alternative :P.\r\nFirstly, as far as the  story goes its divided in 5 entirely different stories, so each of them have a totally different feel to them. In my opinion, they tried too hard to be more artsy and create complexity but art already is complex and in Japan's nature they make profoundstories but they choose the wrong subject to illustrate that. Conclusively, some stories I was dumbfounded while the others were along the line of good.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the art, my God was it beautiful. If your the type whom will disregard the story and watch a series just for the art then you really should get your hands on this one. Since, Takeshi Obata, Kubo Tite, and Takeshi Konomi did a brilliant job, you can watch it just for that ^_~\\n\\n\r\nThirdly, when it comes to sound then a little to be said, it was fine but sometimes didn't fit the situation in my opinion. Moving on, the seiyuus were good, Sakai Masato did a well job seeing that he is a real-life actor. On a different note, it was a bit funny cause I've seen his movie before watching this show and I have to say his voice was the most distinct.\\n\\n\r\nFourthly, lets face it, it was too short to properly develop any character especially judging by how complex some stories were. So, the characters were left stranded due to the over-focus on the execution of the whole series, does it make sense?\\n\\n\r\nFifthly, enjoyment? To be honest, its quite a depressing anime. Thats why I watched 2-3 episodes per day whereas I would usually watch 4-5. That being said you be the judge cause it really was a bit heavy and hard hitting concept wise.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, overall it can average around 7 for, it has actually but I might change it in the future. It all depends on the effects it leaves on me after some time.\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to keep it short but guess there was just too much to tell.\\n\r\nHope you found this review helpful! ^_^",

Even though I had not read any of the stories these adaptations were based on , there was no doubt to me that they were masterful interpretations, whether they were honest to the original or not. I was overjoyed by this sterling example of what, let us say \"higher\" animation ought to be. Well, at least one type of \"high\" animation. Everything about  these adaptations is wonderful. Animation, dialogue, scenery, pacing, comedy, general awkwardness; it all culminates in a truly remarkable atmosphere.\r\nI havesince read three of the stories that were adapted: No Longer Human, In the Woods (or whatever you wanna call it), and Spider's Thread. They are all great works, especially No Longer Human in my opinion. I would even argue that Spider's Thread is much more breathtaking in the animated adaptation. Oh good lord, if you would like to watch animation at its best, please spend the time to watch this series.",

            "content": "\"Masterpieces are Blue.\"\r\n'Aoi Bungaku Series' (literally 'Blue Literature Series') is an anime adaptation of 6 Japanese masterpiece novels of 20th century, in commemoration of 100th anniversary of Dazai Osamu's birth (the author of 'No Longer Human' and 'Run, Melos!').\r\nThe color blue symbolizes youth in Japan. These works of literature are forever young, in context, the title of this anime series is 'Timeless Japanese Classics'.\r\nSTORY:\r\nNovel adaptations,\r\nEp1~4: 'No Longer Human' (Dazai Osamu)\r\nEp5~6: 'Under the Full Bloom of Cherry Blossom Forest' (Sakaguchi Ango)\r\nEp7~8: 'Kokoro' (Natsume Souseki)\r\nEp9~10: 'Run, Melos!' (Dazai Osamu)\r\nEp11: 'The Spider's Thread' (Akutagawa Ryuunosuke)\r\nEp12: 'Hell Screen' (Akutagawa Ryuunosuke)\r\nBeing true Japanese classics, every piece of original literature, otherthan 'Run, Melos!' are emotionally draining with tragic endings.\\n\r\nPersonally, I have only read 'No Longer Human', 'Run, Melos!' and 'Kokoro', but the setting and the way stories are being told are not exactly a straight adaptation, but rather more like interpretations of the original novels by the producers.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8/10\\n\r\nWith up to only 4 episodes per story, the character development is somewhat limited, but with most characters reflecting the authors themselves (or so modern critics analyze), most of the main characters are quite realistic and have depth.\\n\r\nBecause authors in early 20th century weren't paid very well, the writers of these masterpieces endured hardship in their daily lives. As such, the characters in their stories are often in despair and in various stages of mental breakdown, much like the authors who committed suicide and developed drug problems.\\n\r\nEvery arc focuses on the main character very well, and tells the story of how their lives led to their doom.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: 9/10\\n\r\nAnimation by Madhouse is wonderful as expected. No CG, tried and true Japanese cel animation worked very well on screen for these works of classic literature. The coloring is extremely vivid and breathtakingly beautiful. There were many surreal scenes that expressed main characters' despair, and artwork in general sets creepy, ominous, and dark atmosphere throughout the series.\\n\r\nSome scenes lacked details or were too still, but all the important scenes were done very well.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10\\n\r\nThe cast is comprised of insane amount of veteran seiyuu, and voice acting is generally well-done. However, the use of actor Sakai Masato for all main characters inevitably resulted in ill-matched voices, especially for 'Under the Full Bloom of Cherry Blossom Forest' and 'Hell Screen'.\\n\r\nMusic was very well done, each sets the mood for every scene, and noticeably different styles for every story.\\n\r\nED was somewhat bland though.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 8/10\\n\r\nI can't really recommend this series to the general Western audiences as it may come across as depressing, twisted, and meaningless violence. However, it's a must-watch if you are interested in Japanese literature or want to learn more about the culture.\\n\r\nThe anime itself is in no way a substitute for reading the original novels, but it did stir up my curiosity for the novels that I haven't read yet, and it also gave me an opportunity to learn more about each author.\\n\r\nEach story may not be entirely accurate compared to the novels, but they all convey the intended message and make us think. 'Aoi Bungaku Series' shows that the masterpieces are indeed timeless.",

            "content": "Anime being based on manga adaptions are very much common place, in fact, I'm not sure if I know an anime not based off an adaption. However, anime's based on old novels are very rare, and Aoi Bungaku is one of those rare types.\r\nAoi Bungaku (Or Blue/Evergreen literature) follows the adaptions of some of the most popular Japanese literature in the mid 20th century, and how their messages still resonate today.\r\nAs for the story, Aoi Bungaku is split into 5 arcs, one 4 episode arc with three 2 episode arcs. The last 2 episode can be left as either separate stories or together as theycontain the same characters, setting ext. Furthermore, the show contains a male narrator (or guide) who not only tells us about how the books came about, but the psychology and personality of the writers themselves, as well as their life stories. This gives vital information into why the stories can be so dark and why the characters are they way they are. In terms of themes, as mentioned above, the psyche of the characters play a key in making this a good series. From inner bouts of depression, money, suicide, murder and betrayal, some of these themes play apart in every arc. It's realism into the topic of suicide was very stark and informative. But with each arc, the story changes from friendship based, to the mythical and so on, so there is a good choice of different stories to choose from, as well as many different types of atmospheres too, some sinister, some emotional.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the main flaw of the anime is it's inconsistency in its arcs, some of which (especially the 1st and 4th) were done superbly, whilst the rest left much to be desire due to the lack of story development in the 2 episodes the arcs had. Nevertheless, the added introduction of the male narrator filled in a lot of the gaps left by the arcs.\\n\\n\r\nAs for animation, Madhouse did a brilliant job of making the arcs feel authentic to the genre it portrayed. From the dark and dulled down colours in the first arc to the bright and dazzling scenes in the last, they definitely spent no time making sure the animations were fluid. The character models all differed for the right reasons, which was nice.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the characters, it's a tale of two sides really. The character development in 2 of the 5 arcs are done brilliantly, from demonstrating how their backstory made their character, whether it be sexual abuse leading someone into dabbling with prostitutes, to a best friend betraying their trust, it did make for a spectacle to watch. Unfortunately, the direction of the other characters went off at a tangent, in the end, some characters were done well, others more shabby.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, for the most part, it was mixed in well with the different arcs, sad music for sad scenes, emotional music for emotional scenes, simple yet well executed. They're wasn't an opening song, as it was substituted for the narrator which was fine. The ending was a personal favorite of mine. Overall, the music was done to a good standard.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, Aoi Bungaku sets a slightly high bar for anime's based on real novels, but dropped at the final hurdle by keeping the a high standard in all the different arcs. I do recommend it for those looking for a new change to the psychological genre of anime.\\n",

            "content": "Aoi Bungaku Series is six works of Japanese literature packed into twelve episodes. Perhaps that sounds dull\u2014I mean, old literature always seems kinda boring, but this series presents themes of human morality and emotions in a very different way. Think of this as six different psychological, very short anime if you will, each one with a different topic to make you think about.\r\nFirstly: The narrator at the beginning. He's great, and there's this eerie background music playing in the beginning as he asks us to please watch. The way he introduces the authors' lives (...All of them seem to be very sad. I'm not surewhy.) and the topics is much better than any OP that could have been used. Unfortunately, the ED is really, really bad. It has a gloomy tone to it which does fit the series, but I dislike it a lot. The voice acting was stellar for each arc.\\n\\n\r\nNow I'll review each arc separately.\\n\\n\r\n1. No Longer Human \u2014 This, along with Hashire Melos, were my favorite arcs. The artwork is by Takeshi Obata, clearly seen by the way the protagonist (or antagonist?) resembles Light Yagami. No wonder that the art was great! Yozo's struggles with fitting into human society and the ghost that haunts him are all portrayed spectacularly. The music was gloomy to fit with the tone. I really enjoyed this one even though it gave me this weird feeling of helplessness after I finished it. 10/10\\n\\n\r\n2. In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom \u2014 The major problem here is the art. Don't get me wrong, it's great, but it didn't sit well with me after sitting through No Longer Human's realistic arc. The chibis come in at totally wrong time. But perhaps that makes the shock value even better; everything's so cute you never see the horror coming. Regardless, I give this 7/10.\\n\\n\r\n3. Kokoro \u2014 Different point of views, that's what this is about. On one hand you have Sensei who has had a cheerful life and looks at things in a different way, then you have K, a pessimistic man who has a different story to tell. First episode's from Sensei's POV, the second one's from K's. Really shocking to hear both sides of the story. Artwork is again by Takeshi Obata and very good. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\n4. Run, Melos! \u2014 How far would you go for a friend? Is it worse to wait, or to be the one that makes others wait? Run, Melos asks us these questions. This arc has the best artwork in the entire series, everyone's hair is gorgeous, and this arc was my favorite along with No Longer Human. Really sad.\\n\\n\r\n5. The Spider's Thread \u2014 Not as serious as the others but ultimately gives us a great ending. It only needed one episode to get the point across. Art was great and fit the tone of the story, as well as the music. 9/10.\\n\\n\r\n6. Hell Screen \u2014 ...Messed up, that's all I can say. It seems that the city is the same as the one from The Spider's Thread. And hell is indeed horrifying. 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nThough In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom is not as well done as the others, Aoi Bungaku provides us with a different approach to seinen. It could even get you interested in Japanese literature. If you like stories that make you think, here are 6 of them in one series. Definitely worth watching.",

I haven't read all of the stories that are adapted in this anime (I've read Kokoro, the stories by Akutagawa, and parts of Ningen Shikaku), but the ones I have read are portrayed very differently from what is actually written. For example, the adaption of \"Kokoro\" cuts out over half of the book and highly skews the way the audience perceives the characters. This series can be sort of dangerous to a western audience, that has no idea of what the original stories are about. However, the anime is definitelyfocused towards, of course, a Japanese audience (which are highly familiar with the stories and what happens) so the staff in charge of the anime has more flexibility to interpret the story in a way that is different from what is actually written. So main point: just because you have seen the anime don't expect that you can have an intelligible conversation about Japanese literature because what is presented may not be what the story is actually like...",

Blue, because the color represents tragedy and sadness, and that's certainly what this is about, as every character in their arc experiences hard moments in his or her life, which they overcome or not.\r\nA terrific anime with beautiful art and well-adapted stories of classic Japanese authors and every single one of them interesting.\r\nI believe some may not like it due to the negative vibe the anime shows, during literally every arc. Yes, the anime is not one of those you watch sitting and laughing in front of your TV or monitor, which isone of the factors that makes it enjoyable for some, for me as well.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't have many flaws and easily it's one of the best of the fall '09 season. The only thing I don't like about it is using the same seiyuu for almost every main character in every arc, but on the other hand - it's an amazing voice.",

One moment you're reveling in darkness, the next you're watching a zany chase sequence in the next story. Truly the only thing that strings these together is that they are Japanese classics. They are not great stories though, the two I saw were fairly predictable if not painful to watch. At times in the very first story, it jumped so much in time that you were lost as to certain events, or why they might have transpired that way. Also, the draw in the more horror based ones seems to be \"Thiscould have really happened\". \\n\\n\r\nSo if you like horror, thriller, psychological, were intrigued this was so clearly linked to Death Note in the promotional art and cover and thought maybe it might cover some similar stuff then you will be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nThis series is primarily for those who enjoy Realistic Fiction, occasionally with Zany anime wackiness, as well as getting an insight into some Japanese fiction. It was not for me at all. The cover should not be a Light wannabe chilling in a gothic chair with an apple, since it isn't even reminiscent of anything displayed.\\n\\n\r\nHowever it is really well drawn, the music highlights the stories. That enough will be all some people care about, I know. Personally I'd rather watch a cheaply drawn 80s anime that had a great story than a well drawn 20xx anime with only beauty going for it.",

PLEASE WATCH CAREFULLY!* \r\n~~~READ \"IN SHORTS\" FOR THE GIST \r\nThis anime is an adaptation of 6 modern japanese pieces of literature:\r\n~No Longer Human (NLH): (episodes 1-4) a rich student who wants to be an artist gets lost in his dreams and falls prey to drugs and alcohol in the mist of his depression \r\n~In the Forest, Under the Cherry Blossom in Full Bloom:(5-6) a mountain man falls in love with a woman who forces him to kill to fulfill her wants\r\n~Kokoro: (7-8) a scholar invites a monk (his childhood friend) to stay with him where the landlords are a motherand her daughter. the monk falls in love with the daughter. the anime shows both the scholar and the monk's side of the story\\n\r\n~Run, Melos!: (9-10) a young man and his best friend make a promise to meet but doesn't show up, influencing the young man to write a tragic screenplay about it \\n\r\n~The Spider's Web: (11) a killer on the loose gets caught and executed. he is sent to hell to pay for what hes done \\n\r\n~Hell Screen: (12) the greatest painter in the world gives up everything, including his and his only daughter's life for art\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 5/10: even though the pieces of literature were all made by the same author, the stories arent consecutive. No Longer Human felt drawn out to me and it felt aimless. Not sure if thats the emotion the series want to invoke but it did. Under the Cherry Blossom was my favorite because the pace was quick and the script commanded attention unlike the others. it was also very cheeky and had plenty of funny moments to break up the darker moments! Kokoro was a confusing little love story. It was bland with very little depth coming from the scholar (the main character). Run Melos! was a little above average in story. it reminded me of a love story that was touching but i wasnt crazy about it. The Spiders Web and Hell Screen were pretty good. it was dramatic, deep, intense, the color scheme wasnt the average dull colors. it was captivating to watch\\n\\n\r\nIN SHORT: No Longer Human and Kokoro were very dull, basically the same scenes over and over. No Longer Human seemed drawn out and Kokoro wasnt edgy enough for me (its a love story). Run Melos! was like a love story. Wasnt TOO crazy about it but it wasnt bad. Under the Cherry Blossom, The Spiders Web and Hell Scene were my favorites. It was dynamic, not too drawn out, right to the point, right about of edgy and gore!! \\n\\n\r\nART 7/10: the art was beautiful in every story. everything was drawn beautifully. the characters were very diverse. the animation was also pretty clean as well! there were no trouble spots either. if someone was carrying something heavy, it was accurately portrayed. the color scheme was the problem. No Longer Human was basically all one color. it kinda hurt my eyes and it made me sleepy actually. it didnt add the eerie touch it wanted to. Under the Cherry Blossoms, Spiders Web and Hell Scene were my favorite. vibrant colors, dynamic contrast, different background settings that kept my interest. they were just really pretty. Kokoro and Run Melos were average. Run Melos was a little better because of the attention to details but they were both decent.\\n\\n\r\nIN SHORT: art and animation for all were top notch. characters in all stories were diverse. No Longer human was all one color basically. boring, unappealing. Run Melos and Kokoro were decent in attention to detail. Under Cherry Blossom, Spiders Web and Hell Scene were my favorite. colors were contrasting, vibrant patterns, dynamic contrast, detail on scenery were gorgeous! very pleasing to watch\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 8/10: it was very pretty. the music seemed to fit the series. the motif of the ringing bell was a nice touch. Again Under the Cherry Blossom wins best in show once again because they created their own show tunes for that specific story and they were catchy!! it was eerie and oddly fit! No Longer Human had excellent jazz music that also very much fit the story and it was great. one thing that bugged me was the voice acting. for some reason the narrator voice acted the main character or one of the main characters in every story and he was terrible. very monotonous!! his voice only fit the scholar in Kokoro. there really wasnt any inflection in his voice that i could remember. also hearing his voice got tiring after a while. \\n\\n\r\nIN SHORT: the anime's strongest category. the music was pretty and it fit well. my favorite part of the series! narrator did one of the main characters in every story and hes honestly terrible. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS  5/10: i cant remember a single character from any of the stories except for Under the Cherry Blossom. they were all boring. Cherry Blossom had the most diverse and memorable characters. They had the crazy wife, the tough mountain man afraid of cherry blossoms, and all of his ex wives and their personalities! (they even had one wife who only spoke english which i thought was comical). but that story made good use of the varying personalities to make some moments light and cheeky, which was a nice break from 4 consecutive episodes of monotony, self destruction and sadness.\\n\\n\r\nIN SHORT: almost all of the characters were boring and made no impact. Under the Cherry Blossoms had the best, and diverse characters.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT AND OVERALL 5/10: every other episode i was contemplating dropping the series all together. I just really couldnt get into it. i watched and liked Death Note, and Japanese Horror Classics which are on the same lines as this anime but Aoi Bungaku just didnt click with me. I did appreciate the modern literature, but things can get sticky when you take modern literature, interpret it in a certain way and then produce it as an anime. you have to really have a specific taste in anime to get into this series. \\n\\n\r\nIN SHORT: the series wasnt bad, it just wasnt for my taste. i recommend this anime to:\\n\r\n~~people who have a strong constitution/like gore\\n\r\n~~like psychological animes\\n\r\n~~like historical animes\\n\r\n~~like/dont mind constantly changing plots\\n\r\n~~like shorter animes",

It features 6 rather enthralling stories, some being interesting retellings of folklore aimed for younger audiences, others being fascinating glimpses into the human mind, often the author's own. \r\nEach story is totally unique, well told and thoroughly enjoying to experience. My sole complaint might be the introduction sequences. While hearing a short synopsis of the novel's and writer's respective histories is indeed interesting, the cheesy sepia filters and sound effects made me groan more than once.

            "content": "Back when Madhouse was at its peak, one of their more ambitious projects was to adapt six classic short stories from Japanese literature with a different director attached to each story, minus the last two which were done by the same director because he chose to adapt the two shortest stories of the bunch and only needed one episode for each one. The only connecting thread between these stories is the opening narration done by some Japanese guy trying to evoke Rod Sterling and failing massively at it, and the fact that each adapted story is a depressing look at humanity's dark side and notfor anyone who gets their kicks out of watching The Brady Bunch.\\n\\n\r\nAnd when I say they're different from each other beyond those qualities I just mentioned, I do mean different. Different authors (barring No Longer Human and Run Melos which were written by the same guy), different characters, different styles, and differing levels of quality as well, and that's kind of a negative mark against this anime, unfortunately. I have to side with the popular fan opinion that No Longer Human is the worst of the bunch, and that stance isn't helped by the fact that it's the first story and it takes up 1/3 of the show's runtime, which is probably part of the reason why it looks so bad compared to the other stories to begin with. That said, No Longer Human isn't bad or that boring. It's just not very engaging for the simple fact that it's portrayal of suicidal tendencies across time is just that: a portrayal. They don't use it for anything ground-breaking or epic at all, especially when you compare it to the other stories. It's like Millennium Actress with a less interesting gimmick.\\n\\n\r\nFamiliarity with the original stories isn't a requirement obviously, but like with most adaptations, it's fun to see what gets changed for the better or for the worse depending on how attached you are to what you were first exposed to. This particularly comes to a head in regards to Run Melos, which only follows the original story about 25% of the time and the remaining 75% is devoted to the writer and how his personal life is reflected in his own fiction. It's a great use of narrative juxtaposition that complements both stories and their ultimately hopeful message regarding trust and the struggles humanity will go through to fulfill that trust. Although the fact that the director re-used the same artstyle and soundtrack from Mouryou no Hako was a little distracting.\\n\\n\r\nNot that some of the adaptations couldn't have used more loyalty to their source material. The second story, Sakura no Mori no Whatever, tries to pass off \"anime humor\" as a contrast to the characters' darker nature and it's simply awful. And I guess that's Aoi Bungaku's main fault. Aside from the differing quality in arcs, it saved all its best stories that actually examine its subject material in a mature manner for the end. The stories that are more phoned-in take up the entire first half unfortunately, so it can take a while to really \"click\" with some people. I honestly think the Hell Screen story should have been moved to the beginning of the anime since not only would it have left a much better first impression (holy hell does the final painting get me pumped up), it would have been nice for both the introductory and the concluding episodes to be directed by the same guy as some sort of show-capping nod. Not to mention, it's not even as great a story as The Spider's Thread - although I should admit that enjoyment of that one comes from how much bloody on-screen violence you're able to stomach in general. Fortunately, I'm a sick human being that can relish in that sort of carnage, but the awareness that I'm in a minority on that stance is larger than Godzilla wearing high heels.\\n\\n\r\nI hate to use the term \"it gets better, I swear\" to describe an anime, but regardless of my personal opinions regarding whether one story lives up to another, every single one of Aoi Bungaku's arcs deserves to be seen at least once, so the \"it gets better\" argument is more a side-bonus than something the show depends on. And it definitely doesn't need to, because the overall product is smart, risk-taking, accessible enough, and well worth a watch if you're looking for something beyond mecha, moe, and everything else that makes anime \"anime\", or if you're just a horrible human being in general. Wouldn't go so far as to call the show a personal favorite of mine, but the last three stories are definitely up there and they're stand-alone enough to the point that I can ignore the lesser aspects if I so desire.\\n\\n\r\nWell, everything except for Japanese Rod Sterling that is. I'm sure he's a nice man in reality, but his \"they're called evergreen because they're masterpieces\" catchphrase makes me want to reach into my screen and staple his mouth shut.",

The stories are connected via there deep metaphorisation, and through a sense of lingering despair intertwined with specks of hope and light. \r\nThe animation is exquisite; the artwork is truly magnificent and the enjoyment of watching an anime with this level of animation cannot fail to make you happy and satisfied.\r\nOf course, the animation in Aoi Bungaku reflects the depth of the stories, and the complexity of its characters.  Although I like to watch an occasional storyless seriesfilled with fanservice, series like Aoi Bungaku are the reason why I am so devoted to watching anime. \\n\r\nI don't think that there is a need for a close inspection of each of the adapted stories. There are enough reviews that do just that, and I guess everyone will have their own favourite. \\n\r\nIf you love literature (modern/postmodern) and if you enjoy a story which does not lay out everything for you, but makes you think, makes you wonder, you must see Aoi Bungaku. Sure, people say it's depressing and dark, but it's also fun and beautiful, and it does not make you turn off your higher brain functions.\\n\r\n I believe that the amazing contrast between beautiful and breathtaking animation and  dark, desperate atmosphere of the stories is one of the best achievements I have ever seen in an anime; it makes you marvel at the beauty of the world and shiver because of the darkness of the human nature.\\n",

Because there are six separate stories there is a massive difference in quality depending on the episode arc, so I will break it down accordingly.\r\nNo Longer Human (episode 1\u20134): This is truly a masterpiece. I don't know why they lead with this one, because none of the subsequent stories live up to it. 10.\r\nSakura no mori no mankai no shita (episode 5\u20136): The story was good, but I can't give the staff much credit for that, andit took back seat to mediocre singing giving it the feel of an overblown music video. More of the story would have been nice. 6.\\n\\n\r\nKokoro (episode 7\u20138): This one almost needs to be broken down again. The first episode is based off the novel. The second episode is from another character's POV. I liked what they were trying to do here, but I felt they failed. Also, the art got really lazy. 7.\\n\\n\r\nRun, Melos! (episode 9\u201310): Another really solid story. More lighthearted than the previous ones. This one has the same author as the first story, so I don't know if the staff was biased in his favor or if he was just the best author out of the bunch, but this one is another 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe Spider's Thread (episode 11): Really good, classic story. The portrayal was rushed though, and the conclusion was lacking. 7.\\n\\n\r\nHell Screen (episode 12): Really good story. I felt an episode about an artist should have had better art though. 8.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was a really good series, and I'd give it an 8.5, if I could.",

Aoi Bungaku, known also as Blue Literature caused in me wave of disgust than delight on epic masterpiece, which it is praised in every possible way. I\u2019m not sure I watched exactly the same anime\u2026So, it\u2019s time to tell about concrets\u2026\r\n\tIt might seem those 12 episodes escaped my memory but, unfortunately, mistake. First history called No Longer Human / Ningen Shikkaku, which was written by Dazai Osamu was literally zenith of everything. Some people search in it biographical conditions, but if that so, author must had ,,interesting\u201dlife. Peculiar visions, schizophrenic tendency \u2013 yes, it difficult to be bored. Finishing this arc, I really haven\u2019t known what creators have on theirs mind. After turbulent was about \u00be anime to the end\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\tSecond - Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita \u2013 or In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom says about some woman and rogue who lived in the mountains, it takes place a few centuries ago. If I\u2019m right, it something doesn\u2019t right, does it? What is in this era do all the technical innovations, known only our generations. We should write history textbooks another time. What\u2019s more, that woman was really\u2026scary. She tricked her lover \u2013 love is blind, whatever. Only positive? They keep a hog which can speak. Since then I want to a have hog as a pet too.~\\n\\n\r\n\tTogether, there are a six stories, but what\u2019s up with the rest? You must see on your own. If, despite its flaws won your hearts, it\u2019s still right. In my opinion it bring only disappoint. This, many facepalms and full of curses hurled at the characters? Highly individual matter.\\n\r\nVery confused, Aya.\\n",

            "content": "You know, there's always this one anime that just makes your mind blow. You have a lot of things to say about it, either in a good or a bad way, that you can't say anything. Well, Aoi Bungaku Series is one of those animes. And you either like it or hate it, there's no in between. In my case, I pretty much liked it.\r\nThe whole concept of an anime that adapts six modern classics of Japanese literature is already original; I don't think I've ever seen something like that before. \r\nSince the anime is divided into 6 arcs that are totally unrelated, I'll bereviewing every arc's story individually.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\n- No Longer Human (episode 1-4)  : The fascinating story of a young man who is caught between the breakup of the traditions of a northern Japanese aristocratic family and the impact of Western ideas; an artist who lost hope in humanity and himself, trying to find a purpose of his life. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is outstanding. You can feel more emotions during four episodes than you do in an anime of 12-24 episodes. The whole psychology contest in \"No Longer Human\" causes you to focus and connect to Oba (the protagonist) rather than the environment or even the whole purpose of the author by writing that novel that got turned into an anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Under the Full Bloom of Cherry Blossom Forest (episode 5-6) : A bandit finds a beautiful maiden in the forest and how he does anything for her and takes her to be his wife, while he already got other wives, but this woman isn't an ordinary woman.\\n\\n\r\nThat was probably the longest two episodes of the series. They were so weird. Although I knew there was supposed to be some kind of message behind it, the story plot made it hard to understand and I think it was the only story I disliked in Aoi Bungaku. It felt like it was all about how easily the human being can be blinded by love and be manipulated.\\n\\n\r\n- Kokoro (episode 7-8) : The story of young man who lives with a widow and her daughter, invites his childhood friend known as \"K\" (I guess) to live with him. This last falls in love with the widow's daughter and the young man gets jealous of \"K\".\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of this story is its message. The story is in two different points of view, and we can understand that it is important to know every part of whatever story we hear about before we judge it whatsoever. Also, jealousy is the main purpose of Kokoro.\\n\\n\r\n- Run, Melos! (episode 9-10) : This story deals with friendship, love, insecurities, betrayal and trust. It's about a playwright who is asked to write the scenario of a theater play based on \"Run, Melos!\". The play is related to the playwright's life and feelings in some way.\\n\\n\r\nIt is written by Dazai Osamu, the same man that wrote No Longer Human. I think this is my favorite story in Aoi Bungaku. It is unique, kinda predictable but I enjoyed it anyways. The ending was more or less satisfying; I personally was in tears at the end of the 10th episode. Friendship can be beautiful and it's never too late to do anything. It may sound clich\u00e9 but I don't think it really is.\\n\\n\r\n- The Spider's Thread (episode 10) : An evil person meets death and lands in hell. The one good thing he had done in his whole life was to not kill a spider he met in the city. He just didn't kill her although he killed whoever was in his way numbly.\\n\\n\r\nThis story made me uncomfortable but no matter how you look at it, whether you believe that Kandata deserved to rot in Hell for all eternity or not, this is a story that is not easy to forget. A mind blowing story that leaves you with many, many unanswered questions about yourself, about life, hell and human stupidity. Unfortunately, it is too short to be considered a masterpiece\\n\\n\r\n- Hell Screen (episode 11): The story of A feudal lord who ordered an artist to make paintings that describe scenes of Buddhist hell. The painter couldn't, since he's never seen the hell of his eyes. But the Lord, unhappy, made him discover it.\\n\\n\r\nA simple story with a successful atmosphere. As brilliant as he was, the painter was also bizarre and inhumanly cold; nothing could stand between him and the perfection of his craft. What are we willing to sacrifice to complete our masterpieces? Everything. A story on how truth will conquer all, culminating in the fate of the Lord himself.\\n\\n\r\nART: \\n\\n\r\nI don't think we can say anything about the art. It is well done. Neither the style nor the quality changed during the six arcs, which is awesome in my point of view. The shades of color differed from arc to arc which was enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nThe special effects were S U G O I. Just amazing. Every episode starts with a narrator that talks about the classic novel is original, amusing and you start getting in the arc easily. The fact that there was no opening doesn't even need to be considered. The ending was really good and fitted all six stories. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nEvery character was so different from another, yet some had a few similarities. And I think that Oba from No Longer Human was the best out of them, his improvements, his attitude... it has to leave a mark on you. I don't even know what to say more about it. Plus, most of the stories focus more on the themes and the messages. And since there is so many casts, I don't think it is necessary to talk about the supporting ones.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nAs I said from the start, you'd either like it or hate it, there is no in between. It is a very, very remarkable work of art that I'm not ready to forget about it soon. I don't think I'll ever will. It even made me want to read the novels although I'm not really into classics. I'd definitely re-watch it someday.\\n\\n\r\nOverall rating : (8/10)",

            "content": "Aoi Bungaku series review\r\nThe anime manages to portray the human nature and human society themes and executes them together with the help of the characters and story . It\u2019s divided in different story arcs written by different authors from the Japanese literature .Each story arc symbolizes an aspect from our society and each brings a different message for the viewer and criticizes the human society through the characters actions and experiences.The main message that this anime delivers is about the struggle of each author to improve his works, portrayed with the help of the characters and story from their respective literature pieces of art.\r\nThe firststory is a autobiography of a famous author Dazai Osamu and his struggles to find his own identity as a human. He is a empty shell or a \"ghost\" as he describes himself and the anime portrays his sufferings and guilt.In the process of finding his own identity he relies on booze, women and drugs.The message is one disturbing and depressive too that the anime brings to the viewer. Its about betrayal, trust and the fact that you can't escape your past no matter how much you run from it.\\n\\n\r\nThe second story symbolizes another aspect from our society and human nature through the use of the symbolic meaning of sakura blossoms beauty. It\u2019s beauty is portrayed with the help of a beautiful woman that can bring happiness or disaster in the life of a man. The author shows to the viewer what lies beside the beauty of a woman, her hearth and desire, the two faces of a coin. He portrays the woman\u2019s desire with the help of a bird who flies to the sky into the darkness and light scenery meaning it\u2019s endless. Also it portrays the human instinct called fear of loneliness and the fact that each human depends on a person , that person gives a meaning and purpose for our life.But it also criticize that dependence and trust comparing it with a demon that steadily and at a slow pace ruins your life.\\n\\n\r\nThe other stories portray other human nature theme aspects like the bond of friendship and tells the point of view from the perspective of each character. It shows their struggles and daily problems that they face through a beautiful allegory to the ancient greek legend Run Melos . \\n\r\nThe anime also takes a look into the human hearth and the dark side of it , with the help of a famous author literature work called Kokoro. It shows the lust and desire for unrequited love and the sacrifices that our characters are faced . Again the story its told from the both perspective of our characters to make it more appealing and realistic for the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThe last story is a more of a critic point of view on the hierarchy from our society . It shows what happens when an incompetent leader rules a country. It portrays also the struggles of a painting artist who needs to find his identity through his works and the sacrifices he is faced to achieve that. It\u2019s a cruel and disturbing lesson about our human history that had many casualties because of many incompetent leaders who were blind about the truth that happens in the country they rule. All of this is conveyed to the viewer through the suffering, sacrifices and hell scenery(corpse burning, people buried alive) our painting artist is faced to create his ultimate piece of art. They say after you witness hell you become part of it and our painting artist becomes one with his ultimate painting creating a masterpiece . It\u2019s a allegory to the fact you can\u2019t make something of good quality be it art, literature or other domain without sacrifices.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion the Japanese literature is indeed a masterpiece and this anime portrayed the struggles , sacrifices , loneliness , human drama, human nature , human society , hierarchy , value of life and death through each piece of literature that different authors wrote to convey their thoughts and point of view about them . Each piece of literature it\u2019s a mirror that shows what\u2019s inside of their mind and heart of each author. \\n\\n\r\nCaptivating, amazing, fascinating , an anime that only Madhouse could made for the viewers with a dark atmosphere , a piece of art that symbolizes and delivers the message about the Japanese literature and human society.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10.",

Sighs*\r\nBefore I start, is it just me or the Host's facial expressions are way creepier than the stories themselves?\r\nWell, my favorites if I had to make an ordered list,\r\n1. No Longer Human and Kokoro\r\nOh gosh, those 2, if only they had their own separate shows, I bet they would have made a hell of franchises, I just move the darkness and the backstories, the characters, the emotions, I just love everything about them, definitely hidden gems, a sold 10/10 score as easy as that.\r\n2. The Spider's Thread\r\nThe main character, he's got to be one of the best if not the bestcharacter ever created in a show, It just suited the story, and made it even more immersive, his look, ideology, and decisions, he's just unique, 9/10.\\n\\n\r\n3. Hell Screen\\n\r\nProbably based on The Spider's Thread story, you can even say it's a continuation of the latter, a hellish society that was indeed, massacre and murder are committed publicly, and no one dares to oppose that cruel Emperor, a classic to say the least, 8/10.\\n\\n\r\n4. In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom\\n\r\nNo, this could have been higher on the list, It had so much potential to be a masterpiece on its right, but, the forced humor kinda ruined it, if it was darker and ambiguous, It would have worked out even better, 8/10.\\n\\n\r\n5. Run, Melos!\\n\r\nI couldn't relate to the story that much, probably it's the reason I didn't enjoy it as I was supposed to? Friendship ties that endured struggles throughout the years, between an actor and a writer, 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this gets 8.6, I'd say 9/10 if it wasn't for some withdrawal along the way, totally a deep anime, more likely intended for a more mature audience, I'd definitively recommend it for adults who would like to get into anime, I'm glad I watched this, would never regret passing by, see you all, and good luck.",

            "content": "This anime consists out of 6 arcs of different lengths based on different books. As you would assume, some are better than others and there is a real masterpiece amongst them, . In this review, i am going to be focusing on the gems and explain what i found appealing about them.\r\nNo Longer Human (Episode 1-4) - This is the flawless gem out of these arcs. The story is amazing. We follow the life of an art student who ignored his fathers appeal of studying something useful and contributing to the society. He goes from one addiction to another in order to find a purposeto live. He despises the society and claims that he is not a part of it, eventually blaming his life on its incapability to adapt people. What he fails to understand is that he is a part of it considering the people that he has managed to get involved in his life during the story. \\n\\n\r\nThis story deals with the human psychology, and the narrator(Masato Sakai) probably has the best voice to deal with it. Desperation, false self-security and most importantly the indifference that our MC expresses are perfectly acted out.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is wonderful. This is a personal opinion but i just love shabby buildings and dark atmospheres combined with the damp, misty light every single lamp emits. The art combined with the sounds really makes this an atmospheric anime, and i love atmospheric works of art. \\n\\n\r\nAll this in 4 episodes, 4! Some anime have 12 or 24 episodes and still fail to set a proper story and atmophere. \\n\\n\r\nNo longer Human was a 10/10 for me. I will most likely rewatch it.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nIn the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom (Episodes 5-6) - To save some time, i did not enjoy this. I thought about skipping this anime in the middle of the first episode because it was so different from the previous one, a huge step down. The only reason i kept on watching was because i saw a GIF of sakura petals falling over a skull which was beautiful and i figured it was this arc.\\n\\n\r\nThis is your usual classic story built around what is supposed to be love. However it seems like it's not love, only lust from our MC. He does not think much, acts on impulse and all characters are overall very shallow. \\n\\n\r\nThis was a 5/10 for me considering that the art and music were great even though the story was horrific.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nKokoro (Episodes 7-8) - This was another gem. This time it was the story and not the art that i found astonishing. \\n\\n\r\nWe follow a young man(MC) who is set up for life. The good education, the proper manners, everything you might want. Yet he lacks something. He cant find courage, determination and happiness. He goes to a man who seems to have these properties, a homeless guru who he takes home as his teacher to teach him his ways. \\n\r\nOur MC is renting and has the daughter of his landlord as well as the landlord living in the house, and our MC is very fond of the former one. When the sensei moves in, they catch an eye for eachother, making an unofficial love triangle. You feel compassion and pity for our young MC whose love is perhaps being crushed by his own mistake. \\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling it the story progresses fairly expectedly, however when you watch the next episode, you see the situation from the eyes of the sensei. This one hits hard. You start to question everything you've seen so far, maybe our two characters shouldnt have met at all? For a 2-episode anime it sure is one hell of a journey that makes you understand that stereotypes dont go far.\\n\\n\r\n9/10 for a great story and message. The art was not the best and did not set the atmosphere, but the story makes up for it.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nRun, Melos! (Episode 9-10) - Another great arc. This is the only arc which made me tear up. The art is on point with similar looks as \"No Longer Human\" and the story is very simple, yet so sad. \\n\\n\r\nOur MC this time is a writer living with his friend. His friend is also involved in the artist lifestyle but as an actor. The story has alot of time-jumps since our MC is writing a japanese version of a greek tale. During his work he realises that this tale is also the story of his life, making it a hard one to finish. \\n\\n\r\nThe arc deals with insecurity, trust and platonic love. Once you get further in and the pieces start to fall into place you understand what the characters had to give up. \\n\\n\r\n9/10 it is a simple but heart-wrenching story accompanied by a great atmosphere. I did not enjoy the ending though, i think they should have cut it earlier.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nThe Spiders Thread (Episode 11) - A short arc about karma. Nothing too spectacular, i thought it had too much gore. \\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off much later than where it should have started and we do not really get to know the reasons for our MC's thoughts and deeds. The story is very gory and progresses exactly as expected. The art is fine which pulls it up a little but not too much.\\n\\n\r\n6/10 watchable but not very interesting.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nHell Screen (Episode 12) - As the pervious arc, this one is very predictable but instead of dealing with karma it deals with totalitarian regimes, which gives more to work with. Our MC is the best painter in the country and as expected the Lord wants him to paint more and more magnificent pictures of this wonderful land. However our MC has had enough.\\n\\n\r\nVery simple and predictable yet descriptive and teaching. It gives an idea of what it is to live under a totalitarian regime. Behind all the happy facades in form of parties and celebrations there is something much darker lurking, ready to attack as soon as you take a wrong step.\\n\\n\r\n7/10 for a predictable short story but nice art and message.\\n\\n\r\nIn total i give this anime 9/10 because i feel that especially the first arc outweigh most of the bad ones. The 4 first episodes are absolutely worth watching, you decide on the rest. They are evergreens because they are masterpieces, relevant yet today.",

            "content": "Not knowing where to start I would say Bungaku Aoi is a death Box!! Yes, because during these six stories, six of these classic Japanese, we are told the death from several views. I had almost never seen an anime in this genre, where despair is present from beginning to end!\r\nNo Longer Human (Ningen Shikkaku): The first story (4 episodes) depicts a tragic period in the life of the author Osamu Dasai. The drama and richness of the narrative is found between themes of suicide, loss of identity and search for humanity ... The title of the new exhibits in the implicit battle of aman against himself. Needless to say that the registry is defeatist and no way out seems to be the general impression of the author on life itself.\\n\\n\r\n In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom (Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita): The second story is spread over two episodes. The atmosphere changes, the colours are brighter, plots keep coming faster and it seems to fall into a series of adventure. The animation on it is much more traditional and it detaches from the realism of other tales. The story refers to a kind of folklore, myth or legend that would be similar to the interpretation of loneliness. This tale amused me most because it integrates skilfully combines drama and burlesque.\\n\\n\r\n3.       Kokoro: The third story also adopts the same format with another small feature. This means that the author will be positioned on two different points of views in relation to the sequence of events. He tells two different ways of facts through the eyes of two antagonistic characters. The themes of friendship, love and trust are treated. Again, the narrative is subtly done and creates the surprise in the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nRun, Melos (Hashire, Melos!):  If the title means anything to you or tells you absolutely nothing, it is an ancient Greek legend picked up by the Roman author Gaius Julius Hyginus(thank you Wikipedia!!). Why the choice of this tragedy? It\u2019s to illustrate the trouble caused by the expectation in the eyes of the author through the themes of friendship and mutual trust.\\n\\n\r\nThe Spider\u2019s Thread and Hell Screen : Eh! As have we done with this drama? No, but the last two are so related stories rich in colour and moral. We go in a totally imaginary, probably another world in which human cruelty take you to artistically project a vision of hell. I particularly enjoyed the last one, I would call it ... Sumptuous.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThat is my brief impressions on Aoi Bungaku Series: a series of four new literary authors who have marked Japanese literature and my mind too.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no fault that I can raise in this animation, simply astonishment. Whether through the realization of the different panoramas, the reproduction of the time details (including Showa 1926-1989), the atmosphere made by colours, design costumes, the transcript of this exchange between dream, the nightmare and reality, what is absolutely certain is that the quality of graphics absorbs the viewer and constantly seeking his attention. Each party, each story, I say absolutely every story has a great job. And the latest episodes have reached a paroxysm. A true artistic intelligence conducted on several levels and various sequences. The chara-design is very nice, the participation of manga artists who have worked on projects is famous for something. The characters are very charismatic.\\n\\n\r\nAoi Bungaku Series interests, it is because his stories are intriguing. It is not in the superficial extravagance and excess, everything is just conducted, often in a very relevant realism. Ultimately, I would have had a great time, my words may seem inseparable recurring and my impressions, but I don\u2019t have enough words to qualify this great narrative and screenplay work. This Series allowed me to dream.\\n\\n\r\nEven if I was totally conquered, there is no guarantee that this series can please everyone, so try it and judge it by yourself.",

            "content": "This series is comprised of adaptations of 6 modern classics in Japanese literature which are Osamu Dazai\u2019s No Longer Human (Ningen Shikkaku), Run, Melos! (Hashire, Melos!), Natsume Soseki\u2019s Kokoro, Ryunosuke Akutagawa\u2019s Hell Screen (Jigoku Hen) , The Spider's Thread (Kumo no Ito), and Ango Sakaguchi's In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom (Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita).\r\nI will not talk about all 6 of the stories instead I will tell you about my favorite story.\r\nOsamu Dazai's No Longer Human (Ningen Shikkaku):\r\nA high school student becomes alienate, he falls into a cycle of self abuse, depression and drugs that taint his life foryears. This story is told in 3 chapters (each chapter being at a different point in his life) ,the final chapter leaves him standing alone - an empty and hollow charicature of his former self.\\n\\n\r\nStory: (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis series will leave you with many mixed emotions, the plots will have you very intrigued. After I finished Aoi Bungaku I felt different, like I had a greater understanding of many things including life's challenges.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nEach story has a different art style for example, No Longer Human has a more ominous art style while Run, Melos! has a more bright and enchanting art style. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe show is not dubbed, it is subbed (Even if you don't like subbed anime I'd still give this one a go)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is good with expressing how the character feels, again each stories main character is DIFFERENT they have different personalities, etc...

            "content": "Probably/definitely spoilers, you have been warned!\r\nAoi Bungaku Series has an interesting idea of adapting famous short novels, but falls short trying to do six of them in 12 episodes of about 24 minutes an episode. What is really fun about this is that every episode starts with a real Japanese man generally informing you what the story is about and information about the author.\r\nNo longer human (episode 1-4): This one I thought was the most interesting one. It tells the story of a young man that no longer believes he is humans and merely a \"ghost\". This is mostly because he simply doesn't understand humans,is alienated by his father because he wanted to be an artist and as a child several women had taken advantage of him (not that he seemed to mind, but still). He is tormented by the fact that he failed his double suicide with the woman he loved and is called a murderer by society. Even after that he wants to try being human and fit in while living by a reporter and her child. Of course all good things end. He ends up in a cycle of alcohol and sex with the female bartender. He really breaks after the talk with the child he had grown fond of and who even called him her dad. He runs away from the conversation and later has a nice talk about how society is just a group of people with the woman that constantly criticised him for drinking so much. The conversation made him care less about being human and she becomes his goddes. In the last episode they're married because apparently she really didn't want him to be a drunkard. They buy an appartment together wich he pays for as a succesful manga artist, which may only be because of the favours his wife has done. Those favours cause her to be raped, witnessed by him and his friend who doesn't really matter overall and came to say goodbye because he's going to work for the Japanese army. \\n\r\nShe wants to kill herself after the rape, but he stops her and tries to kill himself instead. It ends with him escaping the hospital, going to some woman that looks like the double suicide woman and asking her for some drugs to stop the pain. \\n\r\nYeah, pretty anticlimactic. The most annoying thing to me was that he is just engulfed with despair and never really reflects on his emotions and actions.\\n\\n\r\nSakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita (episode 5-6): This one is a weird one. It starts simple- there lives a kind bandit in the mountains that doesn't kill and occasionally kidnaps cute woman to become his wife. Also, he has a big fear for cherry blossom that never really is explained. There's also this boar that can talk for some reason as a background character. In short, the bandit lives happily with his wives until he meets another beautiful lady, but this one's from the city. She causes him to kill almost everybody and lets him deliver their heads to her, because that's what she's into. In the end he wants to go back to the mountain, he hates the city. She agrees, he takes her to the mountain, but for some reason he walks to the cherry blossoms that are in bloom and which he is afraid of. His wife turns into a demon on his back, so he starts to choke her. Plot twist: she wasn't a demon, the bandit was the woman all along, she is dead, he may be dead and glasses waifu is alive and well with Boar-kun and waiting for someone to return as the note told her that was left behind in the house he had stolen for the new wife. \\n\r\nThis story is all over and may be liked (or hated) because of its cryptic storytelling at the end. Doesn't excuse the weird out of place comedy that you find in your typical slice of life comedies. The highlights of this story were the songs new wife sang.\\n\\n\r\nKokoro (episode 7-8): This is about the love triangle between an ojou-sama, a 'sensei' and a monk. The first episode is seen from sensei's perspective, with the monk being pretty intimidating and ojou-sama being a victim of his mannerisms. Sensei warns him not to go for her and monk says he's not into her. Monk commits suicide after he learns sensei and ojou-sama are going to get married, sensei marries ojou-sama and is still not happy because of the suicide that haunts him forever. \\n\r\nThen the second episode begins, from monk's perspective. He sees the world as a bleak place, with ojou-sama, the sunflower of his world, being the only one that literally brings color in his life. He sees sensei as intimidating and tries not to fall for her, but does. It's mutual ad they want to elope because of the arranged marriage with sensei. They plan to meet up at the train, where for some reason she doesn't show up even though it was her idea. This causes him to go into some meltdown, he tries to kill sensei, but decides killing himself is a better idea. He does leave a message that he didn't regret it as it was his warmest winter. This story is pretty straighforward, nothing really special aside from the color change with monk's POV.\\n\\n\r\nRun, Melos! (episode 9\u201310): A playwright writes a play based on the story \"Run, Melos\", and deals with his own feelings of betrayal towards his childhood friend. Also very straightforward, but the scenes where they tell the story through an actual play were pretty interesting and well done.\\n\\n\r\nThe spider's threat (episode 11): There's this evil bandit that kills for fun, he kills some kid's mom and is stabbed by him later on. This causes him to get caught later on and publically excecuted. But because he didn't completely stab a spider while trying to escape from the city guards (this scene was so stupid)  he gets a chance to escape hell. Of course he fails because he kicks other sinners from the string and calls it his own. it breaks, everyone falls back into hell, the end. They probably should've focussed more on hell and not on the bandit being an asshole and killing people honestly. Then it could've at least looked cooler.\\n\\n\r\nHell Screen (episode 12): Takes place in the same universe as epoisode 11.  The greatest painter in the country, is commissioned to draw his greatest work, an image of the king's country inside his mausoleum. But the king's an asshole so the kingdom is absolute shit for the commoners. So he wants to show that. In the end the daughter and king die in a fire and that inspires the painter to draw hell instead of suffering commoners, also, evil bandit guy is in the painting for some reason. Then the painter dies laying on his greatest work. Pretty stupid how it ended, but my opinion doesn't matter.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the stories weren't well done, although most were at least interesting. The characters weren't that interesting though, everything seemed to focus more on the story itself. Maybe they just should've made a short anime series for each short novel and call all those the Aoi Bungaku Series so they could've gone more into detail and wrap it all up better.\\n\r\nThe art is solid as to be expected from Madhouse. As for the music, there were some really good scores, but the rest was okay.\\n\\n\r\nNot bad, not good, a fair 6 six for you, from me.\\n\\n\r\nEXTRA: In the short novel of No Longer Human the ending was decent/good so you can buy that book and read it for a better story overall. As for the other works, I'm fairly sure they're better from reading their synopsis. Like Kokoro, which has a lot more to tell than the anime had shown.\\n",

Since the stories have already been deemed classics it is not a question of if the plot is well developed or if overall it was good. The job of this anime was to interpret it in a way that we could understand the plot and translate it wellto the viewer. The host says in the introduction before every episode that classics are \"aoi\" or blue. The anime was meant to preserve the integrity of the stories and present them in a way that would not undervalue the original works. With the 1st story which was by far the longest physiologically and time-wise, the main character battles with his inner-self and his desire. It goes through his life experiences as his ages. The anime itself gives us a very raw display which is left to our interpretation. As the story progresses, you find yourself morally disagreeing with the character's actions. This connects you to the story making you more invested. As the anime progresses to the next story it connects them by having the host explain a back story on the authors and a bit of their back story in order for the viewer to understand it better. Personally I found this quite helpful for the transition rather than just saying that this was a new story. It gives something to anticipate to. For the second story I found myself quite confused, but due to the prior explanation I could understand it better. I found myself more dumbfounded with the lack of time perspective. I found many questionable bits that took aware from the overall plot. But it also brings the question to me if the creators purposely did that. I don't think I enjoyed it as much as the story that was its predecessor. I don't know if the gravity from the first one overshadowed the 2nd but overall it did leave me with a lasting impression which made me have to take a minute to soak in and process it. With kokoro I found myself more attentive with. All the plots have been quite dark but stylistically the story have a more lighter feeling. With the following episode I found myself interested by the 2 different views of the men. Though I was curious as to which one was the true interpretation. By now it has become quite apparent in my mind the social differences between men and women during the era again. I have been slightly educated on the era but it gives me another glance at the matter. Run Melos was quite interesting to me. By far it is the upbeat endings out of all the stories. In this one the main character struggles with memories from the past. I loved the fact that you didn't really know which end he was on. You questioned if he was culprit or the victim. The story takes you on a physiological journey of betrayal and whether to forgive. It gives us a life lesson to think for ourselves. The spider's web is very different on contrast. It's a simple story of a man who then is robbed back by his karma. There's many stories with a similar plot but I found this one to be different since it was simple. It's simple to the point where it shows justice is slow to occur even with the glorified image of it. They finally finish it off with a story of death by passion. Though the concept is bastardized often the story still manages to relay the theme. How much sacrifice will you go through to change the future for others? With modern day values this concept is as I said bastardized. I found it as an interesting note to end off on which left me on my bed staring at the computer screen. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise I found them to be very defined. They did not stray from expectation nor leave me to be desired. I found them befitting to their corresponding stories as well as invaluable to the series. \\n\\n\r\nStylistically the artwork corresponds with it's stories. The overall presentation of it combined with the plot was an exhilarating experience. I found it to complement very well to the character's feelings as well as the overall plot. In anime plot is half the story. To translate these classics well it must have captivating art to correspond with the captivating stories. If not the anime is left to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nSince the anime is very heavy on dialogue I found myself less impacted by the sounds. Though I did find the music of kokoro to be quite soothing after its predecessors which is probably why I liked it more.\\n\\n\r\nAs an anime viewer I want to experience to the best of my ability what I can of an anime. I typically do not find physiological to be up my ally but with this anime I found myself intoxicated by the plots and theory. I will not lie though due to my inability to watch physiological much I was tempted to fall asleep at times only to find myself scared of missing little details and the fright of batshit crazy nightmares. I found the anime to be pleasing and opening to new experiences of Japanese literature and I hope someday I will properly be able to read these classics. Seeing as the main goal of the anime was education of the classics and preservation I found it to do just that. I do hope for future generations of anime viewer to watch this anime for I found it as an experience that should happen as some point in an anime viewers career. Overall the anime rates a 8/10.",

            "content": "A book is but a medium through which an author conveys tone and meaning. A show is but a medium through which those same things may be conveyed. However, what happens when the meaning and tone transfers media? That depends on the success of the transition and the transference of media available. Though I do not base my reviews on how accurate the show is to the source material, it would be hard to judge each arc in the Aoi Bungaku Series without taking a look at the source material and acknowledging their existence. Due to the nature of this series, I also feel likethe traditional categories are unsuitable for review, and thus will review the show on an arc-by-arc basis.\\n\\n\r\nNo Longer Human (Ningen Shikkaku)\\n\r\nLife stands still for no one, and it is up to the person to determine how they perceive life treats them. In No Longer Human, the main character struggles through several emotional and traumatic experiences before arriving at the conclusion of the four episode arc, the longest arc in the entire show. The show successfully portrays the effects and consequences of depression, suicide, and child molestation through the downfall of the main character. In the end, the show is a tragedy, and it does that extremely well with borrowing the skilled form of the tragic hero from Shakespearean literature. Although the show glossed over some details within the book, the show still does a wonderful job of showing the entire journey of the main protagonist, and how his life crumbles before his eyes. The art within this section was good, and the sound, or rather, the absence of sound, complements it well. I enjoyed this segment overall, and would give it a solid 9/10 for enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nIn the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom (Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita)\\n\r\nThe weakest arc in the show, In the Forest, Under Cherries in Full Bloom slaughters the story to the point of almost incomprehension. The goal and motivation of the protagonist is never fully explored and is dumbed down to the idea of love. The significance of the cherry blossoms are never explained, and are merely used as a sort of supernatural veil to cover the horrible, gaping plot holes in the arc. The woman is difficult to figure out, especially her collection of faces. Is that just serving for the downfall of the protagonist? Anyways, the art and sound are fine, but this arc is butchered to a level which defies common understanding. I did not enjoy the arc, but I realize its potential. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nKokoro\\n\r\nIf I were judging this arc based on its interpretation of the book overall, this arc would not have a very high score. However, by itself, this two-episode arc is, I believe, one of the best in the show. The story of two men, told through both their perspectives, is one of contradiction, envy, and love, all at the same time. The two episodes are told through the perspectives of both Sensei and K, one of warmness, the other of isolation. The plot mirror each other in both episodes, describing roughly the same events. However, an important area to note is that the entire arc, similar to the book, is a metaphor. Thus, the plot details between the two episodes may be disjointed and not completely similar to one another. But this difference in presentation only serves to enhance the story, as the plot of the two stories unfold, different emotions are explored and details are hidden or discovered, bringing a brand new sense of enjoyment and thrill between the two episodes, even if they have the same plot. The characters are extremely well-fleshed out, even if readers of the book would disagree due to the show deviating from the plot of the book. The art helps to punctuate the atmosphere and inner feelings of each of the two protagonists, bringing their life into perspective and their experience during the plot. However, it is the sound during this arc that truly brings the emotion alive. A variation of a single piano piece both highlights and contradicts the joys and sorrows of Sensei's life, along with K's breakdown and realization of love. That single piano piece managed to review all the emotions present within the two episodes, resulting in a beautiful melody that almost brought me to tears. Overall, this arc is a solid 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nRun, Melos!\\n\r\nThe adaptation of Run, Melos! is interesting because it doesn't actually focus on the story itself, but rather the story is used to accentuate the main plot that is happening in modern time. The plot of the book is still present in the adaptation as a play, written by the true main protagonist. However, the portrayal of both Melos and the protagonist mirror each other, although the protagonist is much more explored in detail. However, the important part of the show, the theme, is still preserved from the book to the show, and this is the most important part of the character developing, giving the protagonist both a story of realization and redemption in the end. The question of waiting and the waiter is beautifully adapted by the show, as Melos onstage is experiencing the same thing the playwright protagonist is experiencing. The beautiful parallel truly brings the show to life, and the protagonist's journey of self-discovery comes to fruition in the end. The art, as with the entire show, is still quite wonderful, and the sound, though minimalistic in music, helps with ambient noises such as rainfall for the environment. This section is a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe Spider's Thread/Hell Screen\\n\r\nThese two stories are combined due to the show's decision to mix these two up in the same timeline. The Spider's Thread, overall, is a visually impressive but overall uninteresting adaptation. While the bandit's fate and journey is known, his motivation for his actions, his unwarranted killings, are never explained, leaving the plot and characters feeling empty. Although it would've been hard in one episode to highlight everything about the character, the development felt rushed and unfinished as a result. The sound is on par with the rest of the series, thus this section gets a 7/10.\\n\r\nHell Screen, on the other hand, delves into the setting of The Spider's Thread, highlighting the king and the painter. Much more development happened in this arc than in The Spider's Thread, and the painter's final work allows for an introspective moment of debauchery, apathy, and sin. The relationship between the daughter and the painter is capitalized, and the king's hedonistic and tyrannical attitude provides the background for this story, however unusual it is for the people in The Spider's Thread to be acting the way they were compared to how the king acts in Hell Screen. The art is more impressive than in The Spider's Thread, with the painter's final work detailing much more and highlighting more themes overall. The sound is on par. Overall, this section receives an 8/10.",

            "content": "It is outstanding because it is outstanding\r\nperhaps the real joy of this six-stories long anime series is behind the fact that it is actual literal work, written by famous Japanese writers whose social suffering and personal experience shines through each and every one of the six stories included.\r\nStory:\r\n1.No Longer human:\r\nthe story centers around a troubled young artist in search for self-reclaim and confidence, while taken through the series, we are witnesses to the brutality of society when inflicted upon an unsuspecting young mind born with no real ties to the material world, this story hits you deep with drama unrelenting, and some heart-wrenching scenes, Ican only imagine it being the best of the six, since the novel itself is considered the most common and most famous in Japan  \\n\\n\r\n2.Under the cherry blossoms in full bloom:\\n\r\nquite the bizarre telling of a mountain bandit living in seclusion, then the introduction of a young bewitching woman, whose mental sanity and stability is in question, while all seems straight forward in this story, the end and the reference to the cherry blossoms from beginning to end leaves you jaw-gaping and wondering even more as to the meaning hidden in the director's mind.\\n\\n\r\n3. Kokoro:\\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most heart-wrenching stories ever told, the themes included vary from romance (which is the main) to isolation, and psychological references thrown on the bonds of friendship, trust and betrayal\\n\r\nall interplay gracefully, leaving you wanting more, the story takes place in 2 directions, all the more merited as it is second to none in terms of real life drama injected with self-sacrifice and Love.\\n\\n\r\n4.Run Melos Run ! :\\n\r\nIs a perfect example of straight forwardness, heavily influencing friendship as a whole concept, while one friend waits for the other to join him on his life course, betrayal is laid bare, but what is the real reason behind the heartache, some would say it is slightly affiliated with shojou but I found it exemplary and heavily-sympathetic and so much enjoyable, after all friendship is a variant just like anything else subjective to human feeling and behavior.\\n\\n\r\n5.The Spider's Thread:\\n\r\nAlthough intended by the author to fascinate children, the anime show is taken beyond that with the main theme implemented but brought with maturity to adult viewers, A villainous villain is introduced, a mass murderer, the incarnation of pure evil, yet with a slice of humanity, when the decision arises for him to take the road to salvation or leave it, we come to terms with why the series shines best, heavily influenced by themes similar to Dante's inferno, this is thought-provoking literature indeed.\\n\\n\r\n6.Hell screen:\\n\r\nFocusing on darker themes, the injustices wrought by men in power over poor peaceful societies, though somewhat linked to The spider's thread, Hell screen is rather different in character portrayal, as a famous and capable artist is asked to take place in the forming of his masterpiece by the emperor's command, the artist and his daughter witnessing atrocities in their beautiful city, begin to take a twisted and unsuspected approach against tyranny in all its forms, heavy on themes from heaven and hell, this show does not disappoint.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I enjoyed the series, the art with which it was presented, superb quality and utmost dedication, brings the viewer to a satisfied closure, and since it has been quite sometime before I enjoyed a real Drama/fantasy setting, this series was greatly appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nHighly recommended",

The power of these works are in their uniqueness. The failing of thisshow is in its dumbing down of the stories into a series of familiar, hackneyed animeisms. A series of rapidly flashing images to depict drowning in memories! Staticy sound track! The crazy laugh! Voice clips from earlier in the show! + random garbage like DBZ references and bad English for no reason.

            "content": "AOI BUNGAKU ANIME REVIEW\r\nOVERALL: 8/10\r\nPLOT: 8/10\r\nThis series is shocking? \r\nAt first, I felt really bored and irritated watching this. I thought the story will focus on Dazai suicidal and negative emotions but it is actually a 5-6 stories in one series. Honestly, thanks to this anime I understand why Dazai (BSD) is a suicidal one. Though I really really hate that first story. I understand what the concept that story is trying to imply. That the world is trying to suck his sanity from him. That it is full of misery and the like. But. The world is also a beautiful place. It is alsoa wonderful one. It is just on the eye of the one who's going to see it, for me. If you are not strong enough to live this world, then start being one. The second, third, up to the last story is great, in my opinion. Yes, it also reflects the world as a different one. However, they've successfully portray it in a different aspect. They've show us how people see things in a different perspective. How people see the unknown a terrifying one. How the world we're living really looks like. Well, some people might hate this series since I think, it consists of beliefs and negativeness and truth that they don't want to accept. NOTE: The authors of this story made this long years back. Imagine if they're alive right now and is holding a pen. I think they're story would be something more than that. Because I think, the world now is much worse than back then.\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 8/10\\n\r\nThe character is humane. Well, it is not our typical human who everyday sings out of joy in being alive. They are those people who know what the world really is and still, trying to live with it. All characters nearly have the same opinion as everyone else. However, I stil don't like Dazai or rhe first story. It is too emotional. He allowed the world to eat the sanity in him, thus, he became something which don't know the world hope and the like. Yes, the other character is also like that. Maybe I just noticed him the most since there are 5-6 episodes? For the story. And that really bore me. Apart from that, I like all the characters and how the scene go. It is interesting and it is our reality.\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\r\nThe voices of the artist perfectly fits on the characters, in my opinion. It was insane but human, terrifying but sad, it was beatiful. The opening songs are different since there are also 5-6 stories. Though the ending song has only one. Maybe it's a great songs. I just don't like it. It is somewhat depressing. It is not that the song was bad. I think it suit the stories.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 8/10\\n\r\nThe first half, I honestly did not enjoy that much. However, the second half keeps me going. It is interesting and eye opener. It is the reality we've been running away to see. For me, it is a good watch. It is worth the time.",

            "content": "I studied Psychology and still fascinated with it so it is given that my most favorite genre is psychological based stories. One of my greatest fascinations would also be episodic type of stories. And so with this anime that brings those two together is already a sure jackpot for me.\r\nAfter watching the first story, though it is episodic I am expecting the rest to be somewhat like the first story but for my surprise, every story is so different from the others. I didn\u2019t see it coming but I just love how they are so different. Every story comes in different forms and approach withpsychology. Some are tragic and dark, others are scary and horrifying, while some are touching and inspiring. But if there\u2019s one thing that all of them have in common, all of them are such sad stories. Well, psychological genres are always a sad story. Why? For the obvious reason that having a psychological problem itself is a sad thing. Having a mental instability is a sign of human failure and weakness. This compilation of different stories shows the tragic side of life that leads to having psychological instability which makes us human beings. But what I love about them is that after seeing those horrifying experiences of different people, you learn something from it and sometimes get inspired by their story. And because it is episodic you get a new different kind of excitement while anticipating the next story. \\n\\n\r\nOf course with an episodic type of series, there are so many very different characters. Some are really pitiful and some are inspiring. Like I said you learn a lesson or two with their story.\\n\\n\r\nEvery chapter comes with different style of animation. There are stories with a more realistic approach and others with more on how the mind sees world which sometimes in a dream-like situation. \\n\\n\r\nIt is very rare for a psychological type of story to be accompanied by an episodic styled series so I definitely enjoy it a lot. Every chapter is absolutely amazing and worth to watch.\\n",

            "content": "Apart from being a fan of anime, I'm also (and to a much bigger degree) a fan of literature. And when I heard that there was an anime based on classical Japanese literature, I nearly fell off my seat.\r\n   I finished the anime with mixed feelings. \r\n   I was happy to see something on a deeper level altogether (and it is deep), I was happy to recognize some of the stories, and so on. But, I also realized that literature isn't made for anime.\r\n   Most anime is based directly on a corresponding manga, written specifically toaccommodate various desires. Literature is not. So naturally, an adaption comes out slightly grotesque, and clumsy.\\n\r\n   This conclusion leads me to the following:\\n\r\n   while the anime is no doubt \"good\",\\n\r\n   fans of literature are recommended simply to read the stories,\\n\r\n   fans of anime will most likely find it too weird.\\n\r\nSo, while I enjoyed it, I find \"Aoi Bungaku\"'s existence not necessary.\\n\r\nFeel free to watch it, if you so wish, but I strongly recommend the originals instead.",

            "content": "Aoi Bungaku... Never before has an anime made me feel not only depressed, but empty. To me, the only part of the series worth talking about is The No Longer Human section (episodes 1 through 4). Don't get me wrong, the other sections are great, but none of them stand out any where near as much as No Longer Human, so that's why this review will be centred around that.\r\nThe story is fantastic, being told from the eyes of a highschool student who's always been alienated from society, never fit in with anybody or had any real friends. I don't want to say much aboutthe story because spoiling it for people should be a crime for such a masterpiece.\\n\r\nIt's animated by Madhouse. Need any more be said? The animation is incredible and first the dark nature perfectly.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is brilliant, it's strange, dark and depressing, fitting the tone of the anime perfectly.\\n\r\nThe characters... Good fucking god the characters. You're following the story of a depressed, suicidal sociopath and the character is incredibly well developed in just four episodes. I've never related to an anime character so well, despite how twisted the main character is.\\n\r\nOverall, this is one of my favourite anime of all time. It's a brutally realistic portrayal of humans that will make you hate yourself and your fellow man, and for that, it's a masterpiece.",

I have both books and read them several times, and watched those two series over and over again and to put it bluntly: they are simply amazing. If you are even halfway intelligent you will be able to feel a relation and sort of empathy for the characters. Their stories make you think about life and maybe even your own life. I can tell you that no longer human(ningen shikakku) theanime, and the novel by osamu dazai, has greatly influenced my life. The background to the two stories is amazing as well, as both the others, osamu dazai, and natsume soseki(kokoro) led troubled lives. Osamu himself, tried unsuccessfully to kill himself over 3 times, until he finally did, shortly after the book was published. Over all the series is amazing, and the music is quite riveting as well. However, it does not have an ost, which is something of a shame.",

I mean, all were meant to entertain and I appreciate every single one of them.\r\nNow, how I wish all of them would be as good as this one.\r\nAoi Bungaku is divided into 6 stories and each one of them has its own charm. Each has its own style of art and it makes the story unique on a different level.\r\nStory #1 : No Longer Human - This may be the darkest of all the stories, and is thelongest one. It revolves around a man who just cannot seem to find his true purpose (well, at least that's how i see it).\\n\\n\r\nStory #2 : In The Woods Beneath the Cherry Blossoms in Full Bloom - At first, I thought that it was a comedy/musical of some sort. It is the least serious of all the stories but it is as thought provoking as the last. \\n\\n\r\nStory #3 : Kokoro - The lovestory with a very interesting approach to it. Its unconventional storytelling is what makes it so moving.\\n\\n\r\nStory #4 : Run, Melos - The usual story about friendship told in a not-so-usual way (seems like a story is encompassed within a story)\\n\\n\r\nStory #5 : The Spider's Thread - Bloody and Jigoku-Shoujo-kind of creepy\\n\\n\r\nStory #6 : Hell Screen - Somewhat connected to #5 --- Eye-Opening Art indeed!\\n\\n\r\nI will not go to lengths and over-analyze. All I can say is that this is highly recommended and I would leave the others to just see it for themselves.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Preferences: Kokoro (best story) and Run, Melos (best art)\\n\\n\r\n\"They are evergreen because they are masterpieces.\" --- and I don't doubt that they are...\\n",
