            "content": "Binbougami ga! is an excellent example of a simply outrageous anime. I'd chalk up Beelzebub or Kore wa Zombie Desu-ka as similar animes.\r\nI was on the fence with the anime originally because of the story synopsis. On top of the weird girl with the bandana, I was turned off until the 5th episode came out. Then I started to watch the series.\r\nBinbougami ga! is hilarious and completely slapstick. It features obvious references to other anime/manga or Japanese tropes while boasting a simple but fairly heartwarming arc as Sakura Ichiko proves she is a dynamic character.\r\nComedy wise, the visuals and voice acting really bring it alltogether beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise, everything is pretty fun. The main characters bring a lot of a fun to the table especially. In fact, most of the characters are surprisingly unpredictable at times, yielding some funny results.\\n\\n\r\nThe music matches sequences well and the track is fairly reminiscent of Final Fantasy XIII's battle theme and victory fanfare which is -- odd.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that's detracted from this anime for me is the bad video players I use and at the start, I had some serious problems with Misfortune God's bandana and cast -- but I eventually warmed up to it and I learned to tolerate watching the first 10 minutes of an episode more than once.\\n\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, if you've already picked up the series -- you've probably already decided your views on the anime with 6 episodes under your belt. However, if you were on the fence about it -- please give 1-2 episodes a chance!\\n\\n\r\nThe driving plot point of the anime is fresh in the midst of a fairly awkward summer season and allows for fun slapstick comedy on top of some fairly bittersweet moments.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPS; The intro song seems familiar, but I can't really put my finger on it. It's an okay song, although the end theme isn't much fun -- for me at least.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHave a good day and thanks for reading!\\n",

            "content": "What is something you would spend your 23 minutes on per episode, that'll make you very tired of laughing? The answer is \"Binbougami ga!\" \r\nHere's a review based on my opinions after completing the anime.\r\n\u3010Story\u3011Rating: 8\r\nBinbougami ga! is not only known for its humour, it also teaches the viewers a lesson in life about sharing, respecting and caring for others rather than being selfish; only think about ourselves. It also displays how anything is possible if we look beyond what's there. For example, Ichiko, the well known beauty queen of the class who's perfect at everything, totally self-centred, pretty much you can describe her asa \"snob\". Well let me say, even she can change into a more caring person with the help of Momiji, the goddess of misfortune and others. \\n\\n\\n\r\n\u3010Art\u3011Rating: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Binbougami ga! is nice, although it's not the best I ever seen, however it can range from simple artwork to really nice ones. However I would want Momiji and Ranmaru to actually wear the school's uniform throughout the anime when they're at school. I mean wouldn't the school not allow students breaking the dress code rule? Having Ranmaru wear a blue outfit and sandals can quite make her stand out especially when she has bright pink hair and the binds wrapped around her breasts. Although Momiji for the most of the time is wearing a uniform, but it's nothing close to the school's. Despite that, judging from the character designs, it's still nice and you can see everyone's characteristics. \\n\\n\\n\r\n\u3010Sound\u3011Rating: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe music and sound effects are pretty good but I would say sometimes, the voice acting may over-exaggerate a bit yet it still brings out the goods of this anime. I was really surprised when I heard Hanazawa Kana (voice of Ichiko) change her voice tone in this. Let's just say all of the Seiy\u016b are amazing with the change of tone, expression, range and emotions of the voice. Great work guys!!\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u3010Character\u3011Rating: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just spectacular as viewers can see both the main character's two sided personality. For Ichiko, she may be called the beauty queen among the male classmates, but when you see the other side of her she can be a snob. On the other hand, Momiji can be really lazy but she gives out good advices to the viewers and of course, to our Ichiko. When you put these two together, they make the perfect pair and can create many memorable humorous acts. Although as I mentioned before that sometimes they tend to over-exaggerate, anyhow it brings out the joy of laughter to everyone.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u3010Enjoyment\u3011Rating: 9\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching Binbougami ga!. I laughed throughout every episode and I wondered to myself \"how did they come up with that idea? that's awesome!\". I just can't get enough of this with only 13 episodes, I hope for a second season to be on its way soon. \\n\\n\\n\r\n\u3010Overall\u3011Rating: 8\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, at first I was reluctant to watch this however after completing the whole thing, I must say that Binbougami ga! has become one of my personal favourite anime. It is an excellent anime to watch when you want to relax especially having great big laughs in almost every episode. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you're looking for a worth to watch anime, Binbougami ga! is the right choice for you. It is just marvelous. \\n",

            "content": "Binbougami Ga is a comedic shounen series written by Sukeno Yoshiaki. The manga ran from 2008 to 2013. At the tail end of the manga's run Sunrise, the studio behind Gundam, Cowboy Bebop, Code Geass & Love Live to name a few, worked on a thirteen episode anime adaptation. How well does the anime version hold up? Let's check it out.\r\nStory:\r\nSakura Ichiko is blessed with great fortune, far more than a regular human possesses. In fact, she unconsciously steals fortune from the people around her, ensuring her own good luck. In order to maintain the balance betwixt fortune & misfortune, the Gods of misfortune sendBinboda Momiji to Earth. Her mission, drain Ichiko's fortune and prevent her stealing anyone else's. This quickly results in various schemes and shenanigans as Ichiko tries to protect her own interests and the battle between the lucky girl and the Goddess of misfortune is joined.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue with the series is that a good portion of the humour isn't just trite and predictable, but it's flimsy at the best of times. We get the stereotypical perverted monk/master/priest that's oh so generic and played out. We also get the masochistic gag character who just wants to be hit by pretty girls. The only twist to him is that he's a dog God in this. We also get the fan-service jokes, which basically operate under the assumption that shameless fan-service isn't shameless fan-service if it acknowledges that it's shameless fan-service. We also get references used as jokes. This series courageously acknowledges that such series as Dragonball, Doraemon & Lupin exist. Because those are just such obscure series that the audience might have forgotten them. All without making any kind of humorous statements about them that might elevate those references to parody.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the series does have its funny moments. A lot of the competitive stuff with Ichiko & Momiji works pretty nicely, when they leave out the monk and the dog God or hurriedly toss them to the refuse bin where they belong. The series is at its best when it blurs the boundaries of Ichiko & Momiji's relationship. Those moments where they seem more friendly and less like actual enemies. There are also some good comedic moments with Ranmaru. The more emotional scenes involving the three of them do work quite nicely at times. Aside from that, though, the more serious scenes tend to be just bland.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters vary quite a bit. There are some like Ichiko, Momiji & Ranmaru who are decent enough for the sake of a comedy. Then there are characters like Bobby, Momoo & the trio of girls who really hate Sakura who exist solely for one repeated, unfunny joke or to add cheap, completely unnecessary drama. Which is also the primary reason that the scenes with the three main ladies are the best in the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the art is that it's overly fond of fan-service. Or it would be, except that it magically doesn't count because the series acknowledges it. Does that line of non-reasoning actually work on anyone? On the positive side, there are some good visual gags here and there and some nice visuals for some of the altercations between Ichiko & Momiji. The negative and those few positives aside, the artwork is passable. Not good, but not bad either.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe acting isn't badly done. The biggest problem with it is that there's a lot of exaggerated yelling. They got some skilled actresses for the leads: Uchiyama Yumi, Hanazawa Kana & Tomatsu Haruka have all given some strong performances before, but this isn't one of the better ones for any of them. Although, in all fairness, it isn't a bad one either. Their performances here are just kind of okay overall. There are times when they really work and there are times where they don't. The worst performances come from Shimono Hiro & Kawahara Yoshihisa. Not because they're bad actors but because their characters are incessantly obnoxious. The music is another aspect that greatly varies. Some of it is quite nice, I actually really liked the opening theme. Other parts of it are kind of annoying and not well done.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere are some points where Momiji and Ichiko not only seem friendly, but seem to be attracted to one another. Particularly towards the end of the series. Ranmaru also gets some female admirers, but they treat her like she's a boy so it barely counts.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nBinbougami Ga is one of those series that's highly mixed. Every positive aspect of it is balanced out by something negative. It's not a bad series, nor is it a good one. All in all, it's pretty mediocre. My final rating is going to be a 5/10. Next week I'll be looking at Kuuchuu Buranko. Until then, have a fabulous time.",

            "content": "Hmmm\u2026\u2026.\r\nYou know, seeing the previews of this show a few months ago, I wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of it.\r\nThen again, as I said in the last review, comedy is a subjective art form and this especially goes into anime. For me, it\u2019s like comedic shows like Sgt. Frog, Panty and Stocking w/ Garterbelt, Squid Girl, & Kill La Kill does better with me than the likes of Baka to Test, Love Hina, B Gata H Kei and Nisekoi. You can say some of them are the same but no\u2026..they\u2019re not.\r\nI can see myself liking it but then again, it does have the annoying eechi showfeel to it and I have been getting annoyed with those type of shows and the fact most of them may not be my thing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPretty, busty rich girl Sakura Ichiko has been blessed with an inordinate amount of good fortune, so much so that she\u2019s actually sucking the fortune from those around her. To correct that massive imbalance, Momiji, a God of Misfortune, has come to Earth to \u201ctreat\u201d Sakura\u2014only Sakura isn\u2019t so willing to cooperate. As part of an ongoing effort to remedy the problem, Momiji starts living with Sakura.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo\u2026\u2026..that comedy thing of mine? Yeah, I saw myself laughing at a few moments in the show that are genuine but most of the time when they were referencing other anime (DBZ, One Piece, Lupin, etc.) or go overblown with the eechi/boob jokes, that is when I groan at that (I would say more but SPOILERS). I mean, it just felt very lazy writing like these are last minute jokes someone just came up with and decided to stick in there. There is also the heart of the show being that good luck and happiness comes from within and not from the material things although it does feel weak as it goes along and while it\u2019s decent, some of the aforementioned comedy interrupt those moments and makes it seem very out of place and awkward. I can like kookiness in an anime and I think the show tries to have it both ways but sadly some of the time, I didn\u2019t feel as invested in the story as much\u2026\u2026.nor the characters as much either.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIchiko Sakura is the most typical Mary Sue character in the show. She\u2019s adored by all of the guys in schools but loathed by all of the girls but leads a very lonely life even though she has about every material thing in her grasp\u2026..oh, did I mention she got boobs? Hell, her nickname on the show is Tit-chiko and thankfully that didn\u2019t get used as much\u2026..at least from what I heard. I can\u2019t say she progressed but it didn\u2019t felt like de-characterization and I did like the banter between her and Momiji and them getting at each other\u2019s throats. In short for the other characters, Bobby the perverted monk and Momo\u2019o the S&M dog god, whose both character traits gets worn out very early in the show. Keita is pretty much the straight man in the series and the rest of the family are decent as well, just not as interesting and I did like Ranmaru in the show as well as she\u2019s one of the few characters that doesn\u2019t annoy me as much. Also, should I give a fuck about Nadeshiko?\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNo? Yes? I heard in the manga, she\u2019s more vital in there but this isn\u2019t about the manga, it\u2019s the anime version I\u2019m reviewing and I say\u2026\u2026.yeah, I don\u2019t give a fuck about her at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and artwork is okay, it is more of the typical art style that most anime people are used to. Then again, this is much up to Sunrise\u2019s alley as them doing gag comedy isn\u2019t new to them. After all, like I said, Sgt. Frog is one of my favorite anime comedies and they are responsible for that as well and they do succeed with what they\u2019re doing, although I still do get mostly annoyed with it, too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusically, my thoughts on that is meh as well. The opening theme for the show is alright, I like the first 8-bit parts of it and other than that, it\u2019s merely okay. Ending theme is also fine as is the rest of the score.\\n\\n\r\nThe FUNimation dub does help me get through the series as it goes along. I did like the performances of Brina Palencia & Colleen Clinkenbeard as Ichiko & Momiji, respectively as they do deliver the best performances of the dub. Patrick Seitz & Todd Haberkorn are pretty type-casted in the show (Seitz being the black guy although he\u2019s damn good at it and Haberkorn playing the one guy with the nasally whiny voice), that\u2019s not to say that were bad in it, that\u2019s the opposite of that as they played their roles very well. Also, I did like Martha Harms as Ranmaru, a VA that I haven\u2019t recognized in FUNi dubs in the past that could become more noticeable in the future.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: The show does have its charms and I have thought of some moments in there to be funny and have some heart but it does tend to lose that quickly when some of the humor gets tired. It\u2019s stupid and silly in both the right ways\u2026..and the wrong ways, too. I will say that it is worth a watch but this is more of a stream it rather than buy right away. Just dip your toe in the world of Good Luck Girl first before owning any DVD and/or Blu-ray.",

This causes Momiji, a god of misfortune, to try and steal Ichiko\u2019s fortune, and a beautiful love-hate relationship is formed!\r\nBinbougami ga! is a very silly series. In fact, it\u2019s a really stupid series\u2013sometimes in the positive ha-ha kind of stupid,and others times in bad sense of the word. In general it\u2019s one of those shows that allows to simply relax and enjoy it for what it is and not vehemently critique it, although there are scenes that stand out as mediocre or subpar.\\n\\n\r\nThe dramatic aspects are by the far the shows weak-point, as it\u2019s fairly mediocre all the way through. It\u2019s a predictable action-comedy from the get-go, and pretty forgettable. Initially the execution alone is done well enough to make it enjoyable, but it\u2019s doesn\u2019t take long for the formulaic nature of the plot to override that. More often than not the the comedy makes up for all this, so it\u2019s an enjoyable series for the most part\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the comedy relies on the specific quirks of each character. This allows for plenty of quality comedy for quite a while, but towards the end of the series they all start to lose their charm, and everything starts to seem tedious. Ichiko and Momiji are relatively more complex, but every other character literally has their quirk define them; every time Ranmaru shows up, the scene pokes fun at her tomboy demeanor, as with Bobby\u2019s pervertism, or Momoo\u2019s masochism.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, the actual ending of the series (episode 11-13) breaks out of the formula, and gives us a satisfying conclusion.",

For the reasons: 1.) It is hilarious (who doesn't want a good laugh?) 2.) The story is light, not too complicated (like I said, just something to pass the time) 3.) Full of ecchi moments (I know I sound like a perverted old woman) 4.) Also, full of cute moments~\r\nBut, this anime, isn't JUST an ecchi, parody or asomething-really-hilarious-and-not-too-serious anime~ It is more than that. Comedy-wise, it didn't disappoint me. I find myself laughing hard at all the funny scenes which makes me feel better everyday~ But, it didn't fail to give every episode a meaning, too.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is light and yet it has substance (if you know what I mean).

            "content": "Binbou Gami Ga is one of my top 3 favorites for this summers anime line up. I have found it hilarious from episode one and i want more and more of this show this is what gets me to my Fridays.\r\nThe Story is highly unique with 2 very opposing character types. At first it would seem like you would sympathize with Ichiko but you find out shes one of the worst most undeserving people ever. Though as the show steadily progresses that sympathy builds a little cause you realize shes damaged inside from various missing aspects of the human experience. Then you bring in Momijia god of misforunte who's sole duty on earth is to make Ichikos life worse and spread her good fortune to others to balance the world. So with a snotty brat like Ichiko to take down Momiji has her work cut out for her. \\n\\n\r\nSteadily the show is building a broader cast with all sorts of interesting character types. From a turtle man too a bizarre teddy bear you got a really interesting cast to say the least. I have not seen many examples of these types of characters, i have seen elements of them but the combinations of all these little pieces creates a very unique cast.  I look forward to seeing who is next in the line up for this series as the shows opening credits promise at least one or two more intriguing characters.\\n\\n\r\nRight now Momiji is my favorite character in this series, her design is unlike anything i have ever seen before in anime or television. A cross between a homeless person and a country girl. The one shoe'd,overall clad, one arm bandaged god of misfortune is something my imagination is quite amazed with. Her color pallet is paler than the rest of the cast really feeding into her characters misfortune like shes been deprived of sunlight and joy. Tho being the god of misfortune she is by far the funnest and most excitable character in the show. When going in to this i had expected her to be either very evil or very depressed. I was glad she was more or less evil and good and not depressed at all really. The biggest source of parody comedy in the series comes from her and her cosplay styled side skits.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for this show is great all the characters are pretty well designed and unique. The backgrounds aren't lacking and the overall feel of the shows visual experience is great. Nothing significant stands out in this show except for each of the bizarre cast members.  The audio is very organic to the show, it feels really well used and appropriately used at all time. The voice cast is also a fantastic choice for each and every character thus far. I cant say i feel anyone is out of place when it comes to voice to face. The Opening and Ending Themes are actually two of my favorite theme songs to listen too in the last year or two, both delightfully charming in there own way while various characters and cosplays roll across the screen providing some sort of fan service for those interested in watching.\\n\\n\r\nTho the show uses some Ecchi elements its not as strong as other shows, there isn't any groping or cliche stuff like that. Its more just jokes about flat chests and S&M. Some of the jokes are standard but others are kept above par and original. The show escalates from a chase to a battle very quickly and makes the game of cat and mouse more enjoyable to watch as the the tides turn and bend in anyone favor.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy this show and i think that if you watch 1 episode and like it your gonna be pleased you keep watching. Then again this kind of humor is not everyone's favorite and some people will know right away if they like it or not. I think its worth a fair shot if you enjoy comedy anime.  This is Getting a 10 for me for being outstanding to me, i really have no complaints thus far with the series and if there is i will edit this to reflect that. I am highly optimistic that the most i will be editing is a error in my typing tho.",

Binbougami ga! is simple but great that's it, is as simple as that.\r\nStory\r\nI have seen the concept of a Shinigami or a god of something coming for the MC, because or they want to kill him or want to help the MC, Binbougami is just like that but very well presented, it's a good story but this is comedy and i tend not to take much serious the story on comedy.\r\nArt & Animation\r\nThe animation was great, the landscape was very good, the characters were very well detailed and were beautiful to see and it was colorful.\r\nSound\r\nThe sound of thison every aspect is just amazing, i really loved it there's not a flaw for me, the VA, the background music, the OP and the ED everything was outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe cast of characters were great, they made this really enjoyable and the best of the cast is Momiji she is just amazing and Ichiko was made like a total bitch, and you just want Momiji to take her ''lucky'' excess from her already, but that's the show it makes sense that's why it's like that, if not there is no show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThe whole enjoyment is the comedy and parodies that are presented in every episode and how the characters were spot on with every parody or joke, there's a lot of winks at others animes, look closely to see those winks.",

I liked the comedy and the parody references to other anime & manga.\r\nSakura may seem like the typical popular girl who's clever, has all the boy's attention and rich, but she has some tsundere qualities. Momiji, the God of Misfortune stood out forme with her crazy antics.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i really enjoyed the first episode. I found it quite funny & i love how the plot is all WTF and crazy. Looks promising and great fun. :)",

            "content": "Did I just find myself a rare exquisite gem? Or was I just living under a rock when this series aired back in 2012? I honestly don't know why or how I didn't hear of this back then. \r\nI've been watching a bit more titles this 2014 compared to the past couple of years and I've only been inclined to write a review again just THIS once. So I'll keep it sweet and short!\r\nIf I had just one word to describe the story, it would be \"refreshing\". I know that there are tons of titles out there that involve deities but this one just standson its own. Its lighthearted and even breaks the 4th wall but you can't help but really get into it. And I just love the characters! Most of them, if not all of them anyway. How often do you get a protagonist that would qualify as a high school villain/queen in any other show? But she grows on you and watching her develop was such a treat. And then here's  our deuteragonist whose character is really just outstanding. I mean her job is to restore balance to the world and all but I love how she went from dutifully lazy > menacing > annoying > moe.\\n\r\nAnd the dynamic between the two was so superbly done, I don't think I've watched any other show that comes close. You could kinda sense it in the OP and ED sequence.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was really good as I didn't notice a drop in quality even when watching on a big screen. \\n\r\nBut more importantly, this is probably the biggest contributing factor why this show made me laugh so much as its syncs perfectly with the parodies. They used a bunch of styles on the characters which I really enjoyed. And let me just get this out there: I love BOOBIES! I really do. And this show has given me my fix. But don't get me wrong, I'm usually put off and could smell cheap fanservice a mile away, but the way they delivered it here was excellent. Not once did I think that it was forced. I just sat here, giggled, and muttered boobies when it happened.\\n\r\nSoundtrack is also excellent and upbeat, just the way I like it. Normally when you marathon a series, you sometimes skip the OP and ED sequence but I don't think I did it even once here. Let that be a testimony in itself on how good it is.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I really really enjoyed watching. Normally I would finish a 12-13 episode series in one sitting but Binbougami forced me to do it in two. Reason being, the thought of finishing it so fast made me sad and I wanted to prolong my time with it.\\n\\n\r\nI hope what I wrote would convince those who aren't sold yet on just the synopsis :)\\n\r\nAnd if you'll excuse me, Imma go pick up the manga so I can get MOAR!",

Make my day! \r\nSonna muzukashii koto ka?\r\nSaaaa, now \"Binbougami ga\" has ended, so how do I rate this 13 episode anime?\r\nHere's how:\r\nStory: Good 7.\r\nOk, so this anime's genre which is compose of comedy, parody and supernatural are a good combinations, the story completely revolves around the parody which is good. I really like the way where the Momiji tries but fails to get Ichiko's good luck energy to put balance in the world, it kind reminds me of a certain situation in the \"Road Runner's show\" (Beep, Beep) where WileE. Coyote would always try to make the speedy Road Runner (Beep,Beep) his meal. But compare to that old cartoon this one has that thing where Momiji would almost succeed  but failed again to get Ichiko's good luck energy where it gives that certain unpredictability.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nThis would have been much better if there were some ecchi in it like panty shots and nipple flashes, but Ichiko's fanservice will suffice. Momiji on the other hand should have sported the same school uniform of that of Ichiko, she would have look nice in it, but to distinguish her from the others, she should don her school uniform in an unpressed and messy manner and she would have looked a bit hotter if she'll be wearing shoes ( in a pair, not one shoe in one foot) without socks. As for Ranmaru, I don't like her boyish attire, she should have sported  the same school uniform, but to give her that delinquent look, she'll have to wear her shirt completely unbuttoned still showing her bandage like brassier of some kind and she can maintain the hat and keep that wooden sandal thingy that serves as her footwear. But, when she was given make over, I really find her cute, too bad she went back to wearing the old boy's school uniform.     \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nI simply like the opening theme,titled \"Make my day\" by Piko.\\n\\n\r\nSo:\\n\\n\r\n Dakara one way, two way, three way, four way \\n\r\nGo way! Go way! Saa you! Make my day! \\n\r\nsonna muzukashii koto ka? \\n\r\none way, two way, three way, four way! No way! No way! \\n\r\nmou goodbye! bad day! \\n\r\nomou mama ni kowashiteyuke \\n\\n\r\ndareka no reeru no ue kara \\n\r\nnozoita shiawase tte nan daro? \\n\r\nkore de ii no? \\n\r\nai toka koi toka yume toka kikiakita shi \\n\r\ntaikutsu ne doko he yukou? \\n\\n\r\nAre you ready? \\n\\n\r\ndakara one way, two way, three way, four way \\n\r\nGo way! Go way! saa you! Make my day! \\n\r\nsonna muzukashii koto ka? \\n\r\none way, two way, three way, four way No way! No way! \\n\r\nmou goodbye! bad day! \\n\r\nomou mama ni \\n\\n\r\nnani mo kamo ga ureshikutte \\n\r\nmukai kaze wa doko kara fuku no? \\n\r\nganjigarame uzumaku sadame wo \\n\r\nkowashiteyuke\\n\\n\r\nBtw, I can't believe that Piko is a dude with a girly voice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so for Ichiko I kind like her character where she is this bitchy girl whose world turned upside down when Momiji came into her life. I really like Momiji's role of that of a bungling deity who can't seem to do anything right, but what I really like is her transformation when she was given a good scrubbing and rinsing when she attempted to do something but failed to Ichiko. As for Kieta, I would really like it if there is that Keita X Ranmaru arc since the 2 look good being together....that is if Ranmaru would be in a proper girl's school uniform. Boobi and Moomo may just be in a supporting role, but boy, do they provide the laughs. There is of course this  Nadeshiko Adenokouji, seems to be more of a cameo than anything else.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nIt really enjoying, in fact in the forums there are rumors of a season 2 brewing, I guess we'll find out soon. But, you know to see such comedy like this is something that one would be glued on, co'z of the surprise that this anime provides, so overall, if there will be a season 2.... well, why not? If this anime was able to gives us the laughs and the joy of an unusual relationship between Momiji, Ichiko and Ranmaru, co'z the kind of relationship they have is that of a friendenemy type than a usual friendship kind of thingy. I do hope if there will be a season 2, that Keita would have an arc with Ranmaru.",

It's ridiculous and you wouldn't think they would be able to actually make a coherent plot that has a moral behind it using them. However, I was positively surprised. \r\nAfter reading the synopsis I wasn't really excited about starting it and the over the top voice acting and character depiction wasn't that attractive in the first couple of episodes. Give it a chance though and you won't be disappointed. \r\nThe ludicrous anime references that vary from Death Note to DBZ will keep you engaged and watching out for the next one. The pacingand flow of the story was enjoyable and allows the viewer to get to know the main characters. The plot is simple but not overly so, together with the well-rounded characters there is good cohesion. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Ichiko, has two sides, the one she shows the world and the one that the Poverty God, Momiji, tries to torture to the surface. Ichiko's character grows and you get to know her background; the development however is cut short because of the length of the anime. The Poverty God herself has more than one side; the wise side that actually tries to help and the slothful sly side that will make you both laugh and face-palm.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nMaterialistic things alone will never make you truly happy; shutting every one out because you got hurt once will leave you depressed and alone. That pretty much sums up this anime. I wouldn't give Binbougami ga! points for originality, besides the Gods of Destitution part. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI needed an anime to contrast all the psychological stuff I've been watching and stumbled across Binbougami ga!. With its characters' silly innuendos, fights and over the top voice acting it was a pleasant break from all the seriousness. \\n\r\nIf you're looking for a few good laughs, I recommend this anime. Its outrageousness is definitely entertaining.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "What would you do if you had all the luck in the world, but only because you'd been leeching the luck and happiness off of the people around you? Well, you'd probably feel at least a little guilty, but you can't help it, right? If there's no way to fix the problem then there's nothing you can do.\r\nThis is the way our protagonist Ichiko Sakura approaches her situation, but there is an easy fix for her problem - she just won't take it because she's incredibly selfish. Ichiko herself was one of the main problems I had with the show as it tried desperately tojustify her selfishness and make her likeable; if it had left her one-dimensional and unashamedly selfish I think I would've enjoyed the show a lot more, but as it was I hated her as a character and I hated when other characters would give into her because they saw her 'true self' instead of just outright being beaten in order to solve the conflict. \\n\r\nSo what about the other characters, then? The show (wisely) doesn't decide to try and flesh them out or justify them like it does with Ichiko and instead mines their few character traits for jokes every second they're on screen, whether it's with the perverted monk or the masochistic dog. The jokes aren't very original but if you already watch anime regularly they shouldn't be anything more than mildly uncomfortable at worst, and who knows? Jokes about groping, BDSM and being flat-chested may be your thing - I won't judge. \\n\r\nThe rest of the comedy comes from a mixture of slapstick and references to other anime which got a few smirks out of me personally, but comedy is subjective so your mileage may vary. \\n\r\nAll-in-all I found the show pretty entertaining and I particularly liked the last 2-3 episodes, but there were bumps here and there that threw me a little and the humor wasn't entirely my thing so I can't say I loved the show or that I could recommend it as a must-watch. Good Luck Girl! isn't anything groundbreaking and if you don't subscribe to its particular brand of comedy there isn't much for you here, but as something to turn your brain off to it suits its purpose fine.  \\n",

Usual comedy series involve someone having a quarrel with another one which escalates into hilarious scenes like throwing him into the atmosphere or hitting someone with a one ton hammer. Binbougami has all this plus the powers of a goddess.. and you know what that means?... it means limitless ideas for pranks jokes as well as other stuff.\r\nWhats there not to like?\r\nIt is like a game of cat and mouse. The cat tries to catch the mouse but fails inan amusing way.\\n\r\nIt may not be a classical but I believe it can rival Tom&Jerry since the whole idea of the series is to make you laugh.\\n\\n\r\nI sincerely hope you will enjoy this anime and laugh untill you burst into tears and eventually dying of too much amusement.",

The back and forth war between a God of Misfortune and a girl with Unlimited Good Fortune is so far pretty funny.  \r\nI've been watching anime for a good solid 15 years and have watched a lot of different series and genres. Most of the time when a new comedy series starts up its funny for the first or second episode but gradually loses its edge and returns to its pigeon hole. Though its too early to tellif this will suffer the same fate as series past I think its safe to assume it will still carry the great comedy throughout its run.",

            "content": "\u201cAre You Sure You Haven't Confused Being a God of Flat-Brokeness with Being a God of Flat-Chestedness?\u201d\r\nI literally picked this anime at random from my collection and couldn\u2019t have been more pleasantly surprised.  Binbougami ga! (Good Luck Girl!) is a pure slapstick, in your face comedic anime with plenty of laughs and morals alike to be explored.  It is not meant to be over analyzed or dissected for any means\u2026 and can be fervently enjoyed by any anime fan looking to take a break from the serious stuff.\r\nLet\u2019s be honest, I\u2019m not watching this anime for the story.  Ichiko Sakura is aseemingly perfect girl who just happens to be so lucky that she virtually absorbs other people\u2019s happiness energy.  A \u201cPoverty God\u201d Momiji is sent to earth to restore the imbalance of happiness energy by taking out Ichiko.  Not a lot more than that as far as plot goes.  Comedic quarrels ensue as Momiji realizes just what she\u2019s up against.  She ends up having to recruit the help of a few of her demon friends to try and get the job done. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing isn\u2019t all bad, however.  As Ichiko interacts more and more with Momiji, she begins to emerge from her shell of innocence.  She\u2019s literally been fed from a silver spoon her whole life, but learns there\u2019s more to happiness than having money and good looks.  The morals that surface from the story become apparent through each episode.  I also enjoyed the random satire elements involving other well known animes such as Deathnote and Dragonball Z thrown in.  It helped emphasize the ridiculousness of the scenario at hand.  \\n\\n\r\nThe fast paced, hilarious dialogue between the characters is one of the major selling points of this anime.  Ichiko, or \u201cTitchiko\u201d as she\u2019s often referred to for her enormous breasts is likeable yet unlikeable protagonist.  At first you hate her selfish, holier-than-thou attitude, but begin to understand her more as the show moves on.  It\u2019s funny how she always finds a way to sneak out of every attempt for Momiji to steal her happiness.  I guess by default Momiji would be considered the villain of the show, but serves to be much more than that.  Her companion bear, Kumagai, with the creepy ass face is also priceless, always trying to assist Momiji even if her goals are ridiculous.   \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also a random Black perverted monk, Bobby who enjoys grabbing girl\u2019s breasts while yelling \u201ctitties!\u201d, a dog-humanoid demon that\u2019s into bondage, and a pink-haired tomboy obsessed with karate.  Did I mention how outrageous this show is???  Each character adds a unique piece of hilarity with their ridiculous personal qualities.  The sarcastic attitude of Ichiko\u2019s semi-love interest Keita balances out the outlandish personalities really well, sometimes even putting an abrupt stop to the scene.  Great comedy.  \\n\\n\r\nNothing noteworthy here, just your standard over-the-top sound effects and an eclectic soundtrack to go along with it.  The artwork is pretty stylish, and looks great in 720p.  Lots of color and detail in the environments, and plenty of props given to the character designs\u2026 I mean not a lot of shows can produce a poop demon.  The opening and ending were quite catchy, and gave the eyes a lot to ogle at as far as fanservice goes.  I watched the series in English and full marks can be given to the entire cast of voice actors, each voice was over the top in its own right\u2026 it kind of reminded me of Excel Saga with the exception of Excel herself.  \\n\\n\r\nI normally don\u2019t grade this section individually, but I can truly say standard grading doesn\u2019t do the anime justice.  I\u2019ve seen my fair share of humorous animes, but some of the scenes in Binbougami ga! were so ridiculous, I found myself laughing a few times in every episode.  It was unlike any show I had seen before in regards to delivery.  It\u2019s very quick-witted, and gut punching comedy.  I was actually a bit sad when the anime ended, and look forward to checking out the manga when I have some more time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Good Luck Girl is one original show.  It may not be the best in any one category, or invoke philanthropic debates, but I did enjoy the hell out of it.  I recommend this anime to anyone who needs a break from serious plots or someone who enjoys a good laugh.  Thanks for reading the review!         \\n",

            "content": "Srry this is my first review so It won't be very good:)) and I'll try not to spoil anything.\r\nI'm gonna write a review this time for the manga and currently running anime, Bindougami ga!. The  manga started in 2008 in Jump SQ and the anime is currently airing in the Summer 2012 season.\r\nSo far I gotta say this series has been a big surprise. I never took notice of this series until the anime started airing and from the look of the manga's scalation releases, so did most other people. This series is like a small hidden gem that not many people will takenotice of.\\n\\n\r\nThe story premise is simple. Momiji is a lazy, rude and flat-chested Poverty God who carries bad luck whose mission is to fix the \"imbalance\" in the world caused by Sakura Ichiko; a girl who is considered blessed in every way, brains, beauty and even brawns but have a two-faced, near rotten personality.  Ichiko is very lucky, too lucky; she's even stealing luck from the people surrounding her. Momiji has to stop her from stealing people's luck and to make her a regular human, but it was tougher than expected and so the battle between God and Girl begins .\\n\\n\r\nNow at first this seems like a really regular setting for a manga, well sort of. I didn't expect it to be a slapstick comedy though and to be true, I was pleasantly surprise by it . The series hits me with a very forward style of humor that constantly keeps me on my feet. Most of the comedy comes from the interactions between the cast of characters, at first from mostly the clashes between Momiji and Ichiko but later on from other characters as well. Another aspect of humor is references made by the characters(mostly Momiji) towards other manga and animes, such as One Piece and Dragon Ball and I even saw Doraemon and To-Love-Ru in there. I even thought that they were doing \"It's Over 900000\" before I realized in Japan the meme wasn't that famous.\\n\\n\r\nNow and then there are a few dramatic moments in the series which helps to show the other sides of the cast; such as Ichiko being a lonely and misunderstood girl behind her two-faces and Momiji, who's suppose to be extremely ruthless in her mission to be more compassionate and caring towards her target and rival. They also serve the purpose of progressing the story of the series rather than making it completely filled with jokes and humor. This is a similar formula to a lot of mangas and animes, such as Sora no Otoshimono and Ranma1/2. \\n\\n\r\nThe most important aspect of the series is the cast, which is the main course of the whole thing. At first you are introduced to the I guess main pair of the series, the God & Girl rivals, Momiji and Ichiko. Their personality couldn't be more far apart and that is what drives the series at first. As the series progresses, more character are introduced, with many different personalities and archetypes and this diversifies the moods  of the series.  They're also well developed as most of them had their share of personal back story and dramatic moments that helps them bond with each other, from both the main and supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't a lot of ecchi elements to the series and they're mostly used for laughs rather than fanservice (well it maybe fanservice for some) and it mostly involves poking fun at either Ichiko's breast, Momiji's lack of breast, some small S&M and perverted fantasies by the series' resident perverts.\\n\\n\r\nThe most striking thing and maybe most obvious thing in this cat and mouse game between Momiji and Ichiko all the ironies in it. First is that since Momiji carries a lot of bad luck with her, so really every plan that she hatches against Ichiko will likely fail. Second and maybe the biggest irony of all is that Ichiko was never really happy in her life even though she was blessed with everything; and maybe the real blessing granted upon her, was the God of Misfortune meant to make her life miserable, may actually make her happy.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this series to everyone, you may have to give it a couple of chapters or 1-2 episodes, but trust me you won't regret it.\\n",

The story is also interesting at least better then some of the other's I've seen for this summer.\r\nWell the story is about this INCREDIBLE lucky girl apparently that has too much luck for her own good so the god of misfortune is sent to get a good load of luck from her and make her like any of us unlucky on the world. At firstglance the main charachter seems to be the normal type of populair girl with big breasts and nice charachte  but in reality she's a *****.\\n\r\nThe god of misfortune finds this out the hard way and u can already guess what happens next, Yes a shitload of funny scenes and weird ass moments. Also I must note that I really like the fact that theyre making fun of different anime's just like they do in gintama. The show also has a few drama moments but are quickly changed from depressing/cry/emo moments too Lol wtf funny moments\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think this just might be one of the most enjoyable and funny  anime's that summer has brought us. Seeing as I have watched half of them and only 4 of them were actually good so far and this is one of those 4\\n\\n\r\nGrade 7\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ichigo Sakura is a egotistical girl who seems to have it all; beauty, wealth, intellegence, and athleticism. However this imbalance causes those around her to suffer. It's up to Momiji, a poverty god, to put things back into order by sucking Ichigo's happiness energy out of her. Despite her determination, Ichigo won't give up so easily. Now Ichigo has to put up with Momiji's crazy antics and bad luck devices, along with her supernatural lunatic friends.\r\nGood Luck Girl is hilarious supernatural comedy with a bunch of parody jokes thrown in. These parodies include series such as Rosario Vampire, Dragon Ball, One Piece, and many more!The anime doesn't take itself seriously, which is a good thing. It even often makes fun of itself and even anime in general. The story wasn't too serious, but there was still a plot to follow which made room for many jokes to be thrown in. This is definitely the series for you if you already have watched a good share of anime, so you can get most of the jokes and humor thrown into it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was very eye catching and alluring. Of course it wasn't the best animation I've seen, but it still deserves some props. The character designs were very interesting, especially Momiji's, and it reeally encompases what a poverty god would look like. Also, the art and animation in the opening were fantasticc, and had a pop art feel to it, which really drew me in. The animation was very fluent and neat throughout.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I would reccomend the dub for this series. I feel like there is much more to get out of it while watching the dub. The english voice actors were amazing, as to be expected by actors such as Todd Haberkorn (Momou Inugami) and Brina Palencia (Ichigo Sakura). They seemed to act very natural as if they were experiencing the situations themselves, especially the conversations between Ichigo and Momiji. The whole cast did an amazing job, and the voices matched the characters perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound track for this anime was absolutely spectacular in my opinion, especially the opening song, 'Make My Day' by Pico. It was very fitting, and the opening animation matched the song spectacularly. It was very upbeat and fun, just like the series was. \\n\\n\r\nEach character showed significance and development in this story. Ichigo especially, as she shows a well amount of character development throughout the series. They gave an interesting approach to her character. I expected her to be absolutely despicable and a total brat wwho bullied otthers. However being a dislikeable character, she was different than expected. She actually had no friends or group, and she never really bulied anyone, in fact, she was the one who was being bullied. It was a very unique approach and they really pulled it off.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters in this series were also very interesting and were extremely likeable. Characters like Momiji, Bobby, and Momou, made me laugh out loud several times such as the time were Bobby and Momou sang a song about boobs, or when Momiji cosplays characters from other anime. These characters were extremely loveable and most definitely fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Good Luck Girl gets a 9 out of 10 for personal enjoyment, laugh out loud moments, and cast of characters that were quite loveable. This show was definitely a feel good show, and definitely a show to watch if you feel a bit down or upset. Even just the opening could cheer you up! Or at least 'Make Your Day'. Haha, get it? Anyways, this show is perfect for those who have watched a good amount of anime, and enjoy some laid back humor and a happy tone.",

            "content": "Note: In this review I will be referencing Gintama  from time to time (which I also reviewed), but you can still read this one even if you're not familiar with that show.\r\nAlright, so here we have another wacky comedy/parody from Sunrise. Is it any good? Let's find out.\r\nThis is a spoiler free review (not that there's that much to spoil anyway, lol).\r\n*Story*\r\nStory? What story? \r\nWell\u2026 Ok, it does have a basic premise. It's about a girl who has too much going for her in her life and therefore she has too much good fortune that comes at the expense of others for some reason.As a result, the God of misfortune has come down to balance things out with her powers. \\n\\n\r\nIf you ask me, this is a ridiculous, thin and not so interesting premise (even for a silly comedy). By its own logic, this issue could've been resolved in a matter of two minutes, not 13 episodes. And they just keep coming up with silly excuses for why it hasn't been resolved yet. \\n\\n\r\nNow, having said that, the premise is actually relevant (in one way or another) to most of the events taking place in the series. And is therefore, used properly. Unlike Gintama, which forgot part of its own premise at some point (Odd jobs? What's that??). So even though it's a stupid premise at least it stays true to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself basically consists of\u2026 well mainly just character interactions between the two leads and other characters that are introduced along the way. It also deals with some interesting themes, but certainly not themes that are uncommon in anime and they're pretty light too. It doesn't have much of a storyline either, it's pretty episodic for the most part. Even though the pacing of quite a few of the episodes seem kind of rushed.\\n\\n\r\nThe story concludes in what seems like an anime original ending (I'm not sure, I haven't read the manga). It seemed pretty contrived and rushed, but I admit that it wasn't all that bad for a last minute conflict. Unfortunately though, a lot of things were left open.\\n\\n\r\nNothing much in terms of story, but it's just a comedy so I won't let it impact the score as much as it normally would.\\n\\n\r\n*Characters*\\n\\n\r\nThe characters personalities mostly consist of fast talking hot chicks who speak in foul language. This series basically took the idea of having crazy and violent female characters from Gintama (which is my least favorite aspect of it, tbh), made that the focus, added quite a bit of fan service and also threw in some anime references/parodies.\\n\\n\r\nI personally don't like dirty girls cursing and fighting each other that much, but that's just my personal taste. So objectively, I will give them credit for at least being different from the usual non threatening moe girls we are all too familiar with in school comedies.\\n\\n\r\nI'll also give the characters credit for having backdrops that are quite rich and well handled for such a short series (and a comedy). It really felt like some of the backstories actually mattered and it wasn't just there for the record. Not to mention the interactions themselves that bounce off of each other quite nicely (especially when more characters are introduced, aside from the two leads).\\n\r\nThe main character even develops a little at some point, but it's rushed and not too significant anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yeah, there's another issue with the characters. Due to the pacing being very fast, some episodes are as follows: they introduce a new character - make fun of him/her for most of the duration- and then in the same episode we're also supposed to care about the character and/or feel sorry for him/her. So the mood swings come and go way too fast and the flow of it doesn't feel natural. Sure, at times Gintama does this in a matter of one episode as well, but it did it a lot more eloquently and in an anti-clich\u00e9 manner. And unfortunately this series doesn't stay away from clich\u00e9s as much, so it's not as engaging for that reason too. And some of the stand alone episodes felt like they should've been stretched out in to two..\\n\\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the humor is quite good and a little different from the usual anime humor, but don't expect it to be as clever, funny or unpredictable as it is in Gintama, even though it tries to be (lots of boob jokes too).. But the good part is that it's a lot less random, because it's almost entirely based on character interaction. The anime references do come out of nowhere sometimes and at other times they're placed quite well. Sort of a mixed bag in that respect.\\n\\n\r\n*Art*\\n\\n\r\nThe characters designs are pretty generic. Certainly nothing we haven't seen a million times before. Though some of the clothes designs look pretty cool/sexy.\\n\r\nThe artwork is generally pretty colorful and bright. I don't think it's too detailed for the most part. And the animation seems basic for today's standards. It's certainly not the fluid kind of animation. And it also doesn't have any decent action to make up for that. \\n\\n\r\nSo it's pretty basic in terms of visuals, with the exception of its decent directing. \\n\\n\r\n*Sound*\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is an ok pop song. I didn't like it much and it had Engrish, but it wasn't bad or anything. The ending is also a pop song that sounds better than the opening or at least it sounds a little less generic. Even though it has some Engrish as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are ok, nothing out of the ordinary and the soundrack was fine too and it fit the mood swings ok.. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know Japanese so it's hard to tell, but I think the voice acting is a little over the top at times. But overall it was handled pretty well, I guess. It's probably not the best, but still quite good. Too much screaming, is all..\\n\\n\r\n*Enjoyment*\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy it\u2026 I guess. But I felt like I could've enjoyed it a lot more if it was at least paced better.\\n\\n\r\n*Overall* 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's nothing much in the long run and it could've been a little better, but it's still a decent time waster and certainly above average in comedy. \\n",

            "content": "Binbougami ga! is an excellent example of a simply outrageous anime. I'd chalk up Beelzebub or Kore wa Zombie Desu-ka as similar animes.\r\nI was on the fence with the anime originally because of the story synopsis. On top of the weird girl with the bandana, I was turned off until the 5th episode came out. Then I started to watch the series.\r\nBinbougami ga! is hilarious and completely slapstick. It features obvious references to other anime/manga or Japanese tropes while boasting a simple but fairly heartwarming arc as Sakura Ichiko proves she is a dynamic character.\r\nComedy wise, the visuals and voice acting really bring it alltogether beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise, everything is pretty fun. The main characters bring a lot of a fun to the table especially. In fact, most of the characters are surprisingly unpredictable at times, yielding some funny results.\\n\\n\r\nThe music matches sequences well and the track is fairly reminiscent of Final Fantasy XIII's battle theme and victory fanfare which is -- odd.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that's detracted from this anime for me is the bad video players I use and at the start, I had some serious problems with Misfortune God's bandana and cast -- but I eventually warmed up to it and I learned to tolerate watching the first 10 minutes of an episode more than once.\\n\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, if you've already picked up the series -- you've probably already decided your views on the anime with 6 episodes under your belt. However, if you were on the fence about it -- please give 1-2 episodes a chance!\\n\\n\r\nThe driving plot point of the anime is fresh in the midst of a fairly awkward summer season and allows for fun slapstick comedy on top of some fairly bittersweet moments.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPS; The intro song seems familiar, but I can't really put my finger on it. It's an okay song, although the end theme isn't much fun -- for me at least.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHave a good day and thanks for reading!\\n",

            "content": "What is something you would spend your 23 minutes on per episode, that'll make you very tired of laughing? The answer is \"Binbougami ga!\" \r\nHere's a review based on my opinions after completing the anime.\r\n\u3010Story\u3011Rating: 8\r\nBinbougami ga! is not only known for its humour, it also teaches the viewers a lesson in life about sharing, respecting and caring for others rather than being selfish; only think about ourselves. It also displays how anything is possible if we look beyond what's there. For example, Ichiko, the well known beauty queen of the class who's perfect at everything, totally self-centred, pretty much you can describe her asa \"snob\". Well let me say, even she can change into a more caring person with the help of Momiji, the goddess of misfortune and others. \\n\\n\\n\r\n\u3010Art\u3011Rating: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Binbougami ga! is nice, although it's not the best I ever seen, however it can range from simple artwork to really nice ones. However I would want Momiji and Ranmaru to actually wear the school's uniform throughout the anime when they're at school. I mean wouldn't the school not allow students breaking the dress code rule? Having Ranmaru wear a blue outfit and sandals can quite make her stand out especially when she has bright pink hair and the binds wrapped around her breasts. Although Momiji for the most of the time is wearing a uniform, but it's nothing close to the school's. Despite that, judging from the character designs, it's still nice and you can see everyone's characteristics. \\n\\n\\n\r\n\u3010Sound\u3011Rating: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe music and sound effects are pretty good but I would say sometimes, the voice acting may over-exaggerate a bit yet it still brings out the goods of this anime. I was really surprised when I heard Hanazawa Kana (voice of Ichiko) change her voice tone in this. Let's just say all of the Seiy\u016b are amazing with the change of tone, expression, range and emotions of the voice. Great work guys!!\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u3010Character\u3011Rating: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just spectacular as viewers can see both the main character's two sided personality. For Ichiko, she may be called the beauty queen among the male classmates, but when you see the other side of her she can be a snob. On the other hand, Momiji can be really lazy but she gives out good advices to the viewers and of course, to our Ichiko. When you put these two together, they make the perfect pair and can create many memorable humorous acts. Although as I mentioned before that sometimes they tend to over-exaggerate, anyhow it brings out the joy of laughter to everyone.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u3010Enjoyment\u3011Rating: 9\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching Binbougami ga!. I laughed throughout every episode and I wondered to myself \"how did they come up with that idea? that's awesome!\". I just can't get enough of this with only 13 episodes, I hope for a second season to be on its way soon. \\n\\n\\n\r\n\u3010Overall\u3011Rating: 8\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, at first I was reluctant to watch this however after completing the whole thing, I must say that Binbougami ga! has become one of my personal favourite anime. It is an excellent anime to watch when you want to relax especially having great big laughs in almost every episode. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you're looking for a worth to watch anime, Binbougami ga! is the right choice for you. It is just marvelous. \\n",

            "content": "Binbougami Ga is a comedic shounen series written by Sukeno Yoshiaki. The manga ran from 2008 to 2013. At the tail end of the manga's run Sunrise, the studio behind Gundam, Cowboy Bebop, Code Geass & Love Live to name a few, worked on a thirteen episode anime adaptation. How well does the anime version hold up? Let's check it out.\r\nStory:\r\nSakura Ichiko is blessed with great fortune, far more than a regular human possesses. In fact, she unconsciously steals fortune from the people around her, ensuring her own good luck. In order to maintain the balance betwixt fortune & misfortune, the Gods of misfortune sendBinboda Momiji to Earth. Her mission, drain Ichiko's fortune and prevent her stealing anyone else's. This quickly results in various schemes and shenanigans as Ichiko tries to protect her own interests and the battle between the lucky girl and the Goddess of misfortune is joined.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest issue with the series is that a good portion of the humour isn't just trite and predictable, but it's flimsy at the best of times. We get the stereotypical perverted monk/master/priest that's oh so generic and played out. We also get the masochistic gag character who just wants to be hit by pretty girls. The only twist to him is that he's a dog God in this. We also get the fan-service jokes, which basically operate under the assumption that shameless fan-service isn't shameless fan-service if it acknowledges that it's shameless fan-service. We also get references used as jokes. This series courageously acknowledges that such series as Dragonball, Doraemon & Lupin exist. Because those are just such obscure series that the audience might have forgotten them. All without making any kind of humorous statements about them that might elevate those references to parody.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the series does have its funny moments. A lot of the competitive stuff with Ichiko & Momiji works pretty nicely, when they leave out the monk and the dog God or hurriedly toss them to the refuse bin where they belong. The series is at its best when it blurs the boundaries of Ichiko & Momiji's relationship. Those moments where they seem more friendly and less like actual enemies. There are also some good comedic moments with Ranmaru. The more emotional scenes involving the three of them do work quite nicely at times. Aside from that, though, the more serious scenes tend to be just bland.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters vary quite a bit. There are some like Ichiko, Momiji & Ranmaru who are decent enough for the sake of a comedy. Then there are characters like Bobby, Momoo & the trio of girls who really hate Sakura who exist solely for one repeated, unfunny joke or to add cheap, completely unnecessary drama. Which is also the primary reason that the scenes with the three main ladies are the best in the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the art is that it's overly fond of fan-service. Or it would be, except that it magically doesn't count because the series acknowledges it. Does that line of non-reasoning actually work on anyone? On the positive side, there are some good visual gags here and there and some nice visuals for some of the altercations between Ichiko & Momiji. The negative and those few positives aside, the artwork is passable. Not good, but not bad either.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe acting isn't badly done. The biggest problem with it is that there's a lot of exaggerated yelling. They got some skilled actresses for the leads: Uchiyama Yumi, Hanazawa Kana & Tomatsu Haruka have all given some strong performances before, but this isn't one of the better ones for any of them. Although, in all fairness, it isn't a bad one either. Their performances here are just kind of okay overall. There are times when they really work and there are times where they don't. The worst performances come from Shimono Hiro & Kawahara Yoshihisa. Not because they're bad actors but because their characters are incessantly obnoxious. The music is another aspect that greatly varies. Some of it is quite nice, I actually really liked the opening theme. Other parts of it are kind of annoying and not well done.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere are some points where Momiji and Ichiko not only seem friendly, but seem to be attracted to one another. Particularly towards the end of the series. Ranmaru also gets some female admirers, but they treat her like she's a boy so it barely counts.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nBinbougami Ga is one of those series that's highly mixed. Every positive aspect of it is balanced out by something negative. It's not a bad series, nor is it a good one. All in all, it's pretty mediocre. My final rating is going to be a 5/10. Next week I'll be looking at Kuuchuu Buranko. Until then, have a fabulous time.",

            "content": "Hmmm\u2026\u2026.\r\nYou know, seeing the previews of this show a few months ago, I wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of it.\r\nThen again, as I said in the last review, comedy is a subjective art form and this especially goes into anime. For me, it\u2019s like comedic shows like Sgt. Frog, Panty and Stocking w/ Garterbelt, Squid Girl, & Kill La Kill does better with me than the likes of Baka to Test, Love Hina, B Gata H Kei and Nisekoi. You can say some of them are the same but no\u2026..they\u2019re not.\r\nI can see myself liking it but then again, it does have the annoying eechi showfeel to it and I have been getting annoyed with those type of shows and the fact most of them may not be my thing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPretty, busty rich girl Sakura Ichiko has been blessed with an inordinate amount of good fortune, so much so that she\u2019s actually sucking the fortune from those around her. To correct that massive imbalance, Momiji, a God of Misfortune, has come to Earth to \u201ctreat\u201d Sakura\u2014only Sakura isn\u2019t so willing to cooperate. As part of an ongoing effort to remedy the problem, Momiji starts living with Sakura.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo\u2026\u2026..that comedy thing of mine? Yeah, I saw myself laughing at a few moments in the show that are genuine but most of the time when they were referencing other anime (DBZ, One Piece, Lupin, etc.) or go overblown with the eechi/boob jokes, that is when I groan at that (I would say more but SPOILERS). I mean, it just felt very lazy writing like these are last minute jokes someone just came up with and decided to stick in there. There is also the heart of the show being that good luck and happiness comes from within and not from the material things although it does feel weak as it goes along and while it\u2019s decent, some of the aforementioned comedy interrupt those moments and makes it seem very out of place and awkward. I can like kookiness in an anime and I think the show tries to have it both ways but sadly some of the time, I didn\u2019t feel as invested in the story as much\u2026\u2026.nor the characters as much either.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIchiko Sakura is the most typical Mary Sue character in the show. She\u2019s adored by all of the guys in schools but loathed by all of the girls but leads a very lonely life even though she has about every material thing in her grasp\u2026..oh, did I mention she got boobs? Hell, her nickname on the show is Tit-chiko and thankfully that didn\u2019t get used as much\u2026..at least from what I heard. I can\u2019t say she progressed but it didn\u2019t felt like de-characterization and I did like the banter between her and Momiji and them getting at each other\u2019s throats. In short for the other characters, Bobby the perverted monk and Momo\u2019o the S&M dog god, whose both character traits gets worn out very early in the show. Keita is pretty much the straight man in the series and the rest of the family are decent as well, just not as interesting and I did like Ranmaru in the show as well as she\u2019s one of the few characters that doesn\u2019t annoy me as much. Also, should I give a fuck about Nadeshiko?\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNo? Yes? I heard in the manga, she\u2019s more vital in there but this isn\u2019t about the manga, it\u2019s the anime version I\u2019m reviewing and I say\u2026\u2026.yeah, I don\u2019t give a fuck about her at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and artwork is okay, it is more of the typical art style that most anime people are used to. Then again, this is much up to Sunrise\u2019s alley as them doing gag comedy isn\u2019t new to them. After all, like I said, Sgt. Frog is one of my favorite anime comedies and they are responsible for that as well and they do succeed with what they\u2019re doing, although I still do get mostly annoyed with it, too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusically, my thoughts on that is meh as well. The opening theme for the show is alright, I like the first 8-bit parts of it and other than that, it\u2019s merely okay. Ending theme is also fine as is the rest of the score.\\n\\n\r\nThe FUNimation dub does help me get through the series as it goes along. I did like the performances of Brina Palencia & Colleen Clinkenbeard as Ichiko & Momiji, respectively as they do deliver the best performances of the dub. Patrick Seitz & Todd Haberkorn are pretty type-casted in the show (Seitz being the black guy although he\u2019s damn good at it and Haberkorn playing the one guy with the nasally whiny voice), that\u2019s not to say that were bad in it, that\u2019s the opposite of that as they played their roles very well. Also, I did like Martha Harms as Ranmaru, a VA that I haven\u2019t recognized in FUNi dubs in the past that could become more noticeable in the future.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: The show does have its charms and I have thought of some moments in there to be funny and have some heart but it does tend to lose that quickly when some of the humor gets tired. It\u2019s stupid and silly in both the right ways\u2026..and the wrong ways, too. I will say that it is worth a watch but this is more of a stream it rather than buy right away. Just dip your toe in the world of Good Luck Girl first before owning any DVD and/or Blu-ray.",

This causes Momiji, a god of misfortune, to try and steal Ichiko\u2019s fortune, and a beautiful love-hate relationship is formed!\r\nBinbougami ga! is a very silly series. In fact, it\u2019s a really stupid series\u2013sometimes in the positive ha-ha kind of stupid,and others times in bad sense of the word. In general it\u2019s one of those shows that allows to simply relax and enjoy it for what it is and not vehemently critique it, although there are scenes that stand out as mediocre or subpar.\\n\\n\r\nThe dramatic aspects are by the far the shows weak-point, as it\u2019s fairly mediocre all the way through. It\u2019s a predictable action-comedy from the get-go, and pretty forgettable. Initially the execution alone is done well enough to make it enjoyable, but it\u2019s doesn\u2019t take long for the formulaic nature of the plot to override that. More often than not the the comedy makes up for all this, so it\u2019s an enjoyable series for the most part\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the comedy relies on the specific quirks of each character. This allows for plenty of quality comedy for quite a while, but towards the end of the series they all start to lose their charm, and everything starts to seem tedious. Ichiko and Momiji are relatively more complex, but every other character literally has their quirk define them; every time Ranmaru shows up, the scene pokes fun at her tomboy demeanor, as with Bobby\u2019s pervertism, or Momoo\u2019s masochism.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, the actual ending of the series (episode 11-13) breaks out of the formula, and gives us a satisfying conclusion.",

            "content": "Okay~ since the other reviewers have already made almost all points of view regarding this anime (including summary and what they think about the art and everything) so, here's a simple review of mine.\r\nI always regarded Ecchi, Comedy, Parody anime as something to pass the time. For the reasons: 1.) It is hilarious (who doesn't want a good laugh?) 2.) The story is light, not too complicated (like I said, just something to pass the time) 3.) Full of ecchi moments (I know I sound like a perverted old woman) 4.) Also, full of cute moments~\r\nBut, this anime, isn't JUST an ecchi, parody or asomething-really-hilarious-and-not-too-serious anime~ It is more than that. Comedy-wise, it didn't disappoint me. I find myself laughing hard at all the funny scenes which makes me feel better everyday~ But, it didn't fail to give every episode a meaning, too.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is light and yet it has substance (if you know what I mean). A very good watch, indeed! ;) Highly recommended, so I gave it a perfect score. :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Binbou Gami Ga is one of my top 3 favorites for this summers anime line up. I have found it hilarious from episode one and i want more and more of this show this is what gets me to my Fridays.\r\nThe Story is highly unique with 2 very opposing character types. At first it would seem like you would sympathize with Ichiko but you find out shes one of the worst most undeserving people ever. Though as the show steadily progresses that sympathy builds a little cause you realize shes damaged inside from various missing aspects of the human experience. Then you bring in Momijia god of misforunte who's sole duty on earth is to make Ichikos life worse and spread her good fortune to others to balance the world. So with a snotty brat like Ichiko to take down Momiji has her work cut out for her. \\n\\n\r\nSteadily the show is building a broader cast with all sorts of interesting character types. From a turtle man too a bizarre teddy bear you got a really interesting cast to say the least. I have not seen many examples of these types of characters, i have seen elements of them but the combinations of all these little pieces creates a very unique cast.  I look forward to seeing who is next in the line up for this series as the shows opening credits promise at least one or two more intriguing characters.\\n\\n\r\nRight now Momiji is my favorite character in this series, her design is unlike anything i have ever seen before in anime or television. A cross between a homeless person and a country girl. The one shoe'd,overall clad, one arm bandaged god of misfortune is something my imagination is quite amazed with. Her color pallet is paler than the rest of the cast really feeding into her characters misfortune like shes been deprived of sunlight and joy. Tho being the god of misfortune she is by far the funnest and most excitable character in the show. When going in to this i had expected her to be either very evil or very depressed. I was glad she was more or less evil and good and not depressed at all really. The biggest source of parody comedy in the series comes from her and her cosplay styled side skits.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for this show is great all the characters are pretty well designed and unique. The backgrounds aren't lacking and the overall feel of the shows visual experience is great. Nothing significant stands out in this show except for each of the bizarre cast members.  The audio is very organic to the show, it feels really well used and appropriately used at all time. The voice cast is also a fantastic choice for each and every character thus far. I cant say i feel anyone is out of place when it comes to voice to face. The Opening and Ending Themes are actually two of my favorite theme songs to listen too in the last year or two, both delightfully charming in there own way while various characters and cosplays roll across the screen providing some sort of fan service for those interested in watching.\\n\\n\r\nTho the show uses some Ecchi elements its not as strong as other shows, there isn't any groping or cliche stuff like that. Its more just jokes about flat chests and S&M. Some of the jokes are standard but others are kept above par and original. The show escalates from a chase to a battle very quickly and makes the game of cat and mouse more enjoyable to watch as the the tides turn and bend in anyone favor.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy this show and i think that if you watch 1 episode and like it your gonna be pleased you keep watching. Then again this kind of humor is not everyone's favorite and some people will know right away if they like it or not. I think its worth a fair shot if you enjoy comedy anime.  This is Getting a 10 for me for being outstanding to me, i really have no complaints thus far with the series and if there is i will edit this to reflect that. I am highly optimistic that the most i will be editing is a error in my typing tho.",

I liked the comedy and the parody references to other anime & manga.\r\nSakura may seem like the typical popular girl who's clever, has all the boy's attention and rich, but she has some tsundere qualities. Momiji, the God of Misfortune stood out forme with her crazy antics.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i really enjoyed the first episode. I found it quite funny & i love how the plot is all WTF and crazy. Looks promising and great fun. :)",

            "content": "Did I just find myself a rare exquisite gem? Or was I just living under a rock when this series aired back in 2012? I honestly don't know why or how I didn't hear of this back then. \r\nI've been watching a bit more titles this 2014 compared to the past couple of years and I've only been inclined to write a review again just THIS once. So I'll keep it sweet and short!\r\nIf I had just one word to describe the story, it would be \"refreshing\". I know that there are tons of titles out there that involve deities but this one just standson its own. Its lighthearted and even breaks the 4th wall but you can't help but really get into it. And I just love the characters! Most of them, if not all of them anyway. How often do you get a protagonist that would qualify as a high school villain/queen in any other show? But she grows on you and watching her develop was such a treat. And then here's  our deuteragonist whose character is really just outstanding. I mean her job is to restore balance to the world and all but I love how she went from dutifully lazy > menacing > annoying > moe.\\n\r\nAnd the dynamic between the two was so superbly done, I don't think I've watched any other show that comes close. You could kinda sense it in the OP and ED sequence.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was really good as I didn't notice a drop in quality even when watching on a big screen. \\n\r\nBut more importantly, this is probably the biggest contributing factor why this show made me laugh so much as its syncs perfectly with the parodies. They used a bunch of styles on the characters which I really enjoyed. And let me just get this out there: I love BOOBIES! I really do. And this show has given me my fix. But don't get me wrong, I'm usually put off and could smell cheap fanservice a mile away, but the way they delivered it here was excellent. Not once did I think that it was forced. I just sat here, giggled, and muttered boobies when it happened.\\n\r\nSoundtrack is also excellent and upbeat, just the way I like it. Normally when you marathon a series, you sometimes skip the OP and ED sequence but I don't think I did it even once here. Let that be a testimony in itself on how good it is.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I really really enjoyed watching. Normally I would finish a 12-13 episode series in one sitting but Binbougami forced me to do it in two. Reason being, the thought of finishing it so fast made me sad and I wanted to prolong my time with it.\\n\\n\r\nI hope what I wrote would convince those who aren't sold yet on just the synopsis :)\\n\r\nAnd if you'll excuse me, Imma go pick up the manga so I can get MOAR!",

Make my day! \r\nSonna muzukashii koto ka?\r\nSaaaa, now \"Binbougami ga\" has ended, so how do I rate this 13 episode anime?\r\nHere's how:\r\nStory: Good 7.\r\nOk, so this anime's genre which is compose of comedy, parody and supernatural are a good combinations, the story completely revolves around the parody which is good. I really like the way where the Momiji tries but fails to get Ichiko's good luck energy to put balance in the world, it kind reminds me of a certain situation in the \"Road Runner's show\" (Beep, Beep) where WileE. Coyote would always try to make the speedy Road Runner (Beep,Beep) his meal. But compare to that old cartoon this one has that thing where Momiji would almost succeed  but failed again to get Ichiko's good luck energy where it gives that certain unpredictability.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nThis would have been much better if there were some ecchi in it like panty shots and nipple flashes, but Ichiko's fanservice will suffice. Momiji on the other hand should have sported the same school uniform of that of Ichiko, she would have look nice in it, but to distinguish her from the others, she should don her school uniform in an unpressed and messy manner and she would have looked a bit hotter if she'll be wearing shoes ( in a pair, not one shoe in one foot) without socks. As for Ranmaru, I don't like her boyish attire, she should have sported  the same school uniform, but to give her that delinquent look, she'll have to wear her shirt completely unbuttoned still showing her bandage like brassier of some kind and she can maintain the hat and keep that wooden sandal thingy that serves as her footwear. But, when she was given make over, I really find her cute, too bad she went back to wearing the old boy's school uniform.     \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nI simply like the opening theme,titled \"Make my day\" by Piko.\\n\\n\r\nSo:\\n\\n\r\n Dakara one way, two way, three way, four way \\n\r\nGo way! Go way! Saa you! Make my day! \\n\r\nsonna muzukashii koto ka? \\n\r\none way, two way, three way, four way! No way!

Go way! saa you! Make my day! \\n\r\nsonna muzukashii koto ka? \\n\r\none way, two way, three way, four way No way! No way! \\n\r\nmou goodbye! bad day! \\n\r\nomou mama ni \\n\\n\r\nnani mo kamo ga ureshikutte \\n\r\nmukai kaze wa doko kara fuku no? \\n\r\nganjigarame uzumaku sadame wo \\n\r\nkowashiteyuke\\n\\n\r\nBtw, I can't believe that Piko is a dude with a girly voice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so for Ichiko I kind like her character where she is this bitchy girl whose world turned upside down when Momiji came into her life. I really like Momiji's role of that of a bungling deity who can't seem to do anything right, but what I really like is her transformation when she was given a good scrubbing and rinsing when she attempted to do something but failed to Ichiko. As for Kieta, I would really like it if there is that Keita X Ranmaru arc since the 2 look good being together....that is if Ranmaru would be in a proper girl's school uniform. Boobi and Moomo may just be in a supporting role, but boy, do they provide the laughs. There is of course this  Nadeshiko Adenokouji, seems to be more of a cameo than anything else.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nIt really enjoying, in fact in the forums there are rumors of a season 2 brewing, I guess we'll find out soon. But, you know to see such comedy like this is something that one would be glued on, co'z of the surprise that this anime provides, so overall, if there will be a season 2.... well, why not? If this anime was able to gives us the laughs and the joy of an unusual relationship between Momiji, Ichiko and Ranmaru, co'z the kind of relationship they have is that of a friendenemy type than a usual friendship kind of thingy. I do hope if there will be a season 2, that Keita would have an arc with Ranmaru.",

It's ridiculous and you wouldn't think they would be able to actually make a coherent plot that has a moral behind it using them. However, I was positively surprised. \r\nAfter reading the synopsis I wasn't really excited about starting it and the over the top voice acting and character depiction wasn't that attractive in the first couple of episodes. Give it a chance though and you won't be disappointed. \r\nThe ludicrous anime references that vary from Death Note to DBZ will keep you engaged and watching out for the next one. The pacingand flow of the story was enjoyable and allows the viewer to get to know the main characters. The plot is simple but not overly so, together with the well-rounded characters there is good cohesion. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Ichiko, has two sides, the one she shows the world and the one that the Poverty God, Momiji, tries to torture to the surface. Ichiko's character grows and you get to know her background; the development however is cut short because of the length of the anime. The Poverty God herself has more than one side; the wise side that actually tries to help and the slothful sly side that will make you both laugh and face-palm.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nMaterialistic things alone will never make you truly happy; shutting every one out because you got hurt once will leave you depressed and alone. That pretty much sums up this anime. I wouldn't give Binbougami ga! points for originality, besides the Gods of Destitution part. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI needed an anime to contrast all the psychological stuff I've been watching and stumbled across Binbougami ga!. With its characters' silly innuendos, fights and over the top voice acting it was a pleasant break from all the seriousness. \\n\r\nIf you're looking for a few good laughs, I recommend this anime. Its outrageousness is definitely entertaining.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "What would you do if you had all the luck in the world, but only because you'd been leeching the luck and happiness off of the people around you? Well, you'd probably feel at least a little guilty, but you can't help it, right? If there's no way to fix the problem then there's nothing you can do.\r\nThis is the way our protagonist Ichiko Sakura approaches her situation, but there is an easy fix for her problem - she just won't take it because she's incredibly selfish. Ichiko herself was one of the main problems I had with the show as it tried desperately tojustify her selfishness and make her likeable; if it had left her one-dimensional and unashamedly selfish I think I would've enjoyed the show a lot more, but as it was I hated her as a character and I hated when other characters would give into her because they saw her 'true self' instead of just outright being beaten in order to solve the conflict. \\n\r\nSo what about the other characters, then? The show (wisely) doesn't decide to try and flesh them out or justify them like it does with Ichiko and instead mines their few character traits for jokes every second they're on screen, whether it's with the perverted monk or the masochistic dog. The jokes aren't very original but if you already watch anime regularly they shouldn't be anything more than mildly uncomfortable at worst, and who knows? Jokes about groping, BDSM and being flat-chested may be your thing - I won't judge. \\n\r\nThe rest of the comedy comes from a mixture of slapstick and references to other anime which got a few smirks out of me personally, but comedy is subjective so your mileage may vary. \\n\r\nAll-in-all I found the show pretty entertaining and I particularly liked the last 2-3 episodes, but there were bumps here and there that threw me a little and the humor wasn't entirely my thing so I can't say I loved the show or that I could recommend it as a must-watch. Good Luck Girl! isn't anything groundbreaking and if you don't subscribe to its particular brand of comedy there isn't much for you here, but as something to turn your brain off to it suits its purpose fine.  \\n",

Usual comedy series involve someone having a quarrel with another one which escalates into hilarious scenes like throwing him into the atmosphere or hitting someone with a one ton hammer. Binbougami has all this plus the powers of a goddess.. and you know what that means?... it means limitless ideas for pranks jokes as well as other stuff.\r\nWhats there not to like?\r\nIt is like a game of cat and mouse. The cat tries to catch the mouse but fails inan amusing way.\\n\r\nIt may not be a classical but I believe it can rival Tom&Jerry since the whole idea of the series is to make you laugh.\\n\\n\r\nI sincerely hope you will enjoy this anime and laugh untill you burst into tears and eventually dying of too much amusement.",

The back and forth war between a God of Misfortune and a girl with Unlimited Good Fortune is so far pretty funny.  \r\nI've been watching anime for a good solid 15 years and have watched a lot of different series and genres. Most of the time when a new comedy series starts up its funny for the first or second episode but gradually loses its edge and returns to its pigeon hole. Though its too early to tellif this will suffer the same fate as series past I think its safe to assume it will still carry the great comedy throughout its run.",

            "content": "\u201cAre You Sure You Haven't Confused Being a God of Flat-Brokeness with Being a God of Flat-Chestedness?\u201d\r\nI literally picked this anime at random from my collection and couldn\u2019t have been more pleasantly surprised.  Binbougami ga! (Good Luck Girl!) is a pure slapstick, in your face comedic anime with plenty of laughs and morals alike to be explored.  It is not meant to be over analyzed or dissected for any means\u2026 and can be fervently enjoyed by any anime fan looking to take a break from the serious stuff.\r\nLet\u2019s be honest, I\u2019m not watching this anime for the story.  Ichiko Sakura is aseemingly perfect girl who just happens to be so lucky that she virtually absorbs other people\u2019s happiness energy.  A \u201cPoverty God\u201d Momiji is sent to earth to restore the imbalance of happiness energy by taking out Ichiko.  Not a lot more than that as far as plot goes.  Comedic quarrels ensue as Momiji realizes just what she\u2019s up against.  She ends up having to recruit the help of a few of her demon friends to try and get the job done. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing isn\u2019t all bad, however.  As Ichiko interacts more and more with Momiji, she begins to emerge from her shell of innocence.  She\u2019s literally been fed from a silver spoon her whole life, but learns there\u2019s more to happiness than having money and good looks.  The morals that surface from the story become apparent through each episode.  I also enjoyed the random satire elements involving other well known animes such as Deathnote and Dragonball Z thrown in.  It helped emphasize the ridiculousness of the scenario at hand.  \\n\\n\r\nThe fast paced, hilarious dialogue between the characters is one of the major selling points of this anime.  Ichiko, or \u201cTitchiko\u201d as she\u2019s often referred to for her enormous breasts is likeable yet unlikeable protagonist.  At first you hate her selfish, holier-than-thou attitude, but begin to understand her more as the show moves on.  It\u2019s funny how she always finds a way to sneak out of every attempt for Momiji to steal her happiness.  I guess by default Momiji would be considered the villain of the show, but serves to be much more than that.  Her companion bear, Kumagai, with the creepy ass face is also priceless, always trying to assist Momiji even if her goals are ridiculous.   \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also a random Black perverted monk, Bobby who enjoys grabbing girl\u2019s breasts while yelling \u201ctitties!\u201d, a dog-humanoid demon that\u2019s into bondage, and a pink-haired tomboy obsessed with karate.  Did I mention how outrageous this show is???  Each character adds a unique piece of hilarity with their ridiculous personal qualities.  The sarcastic attitude of Ichiko\u2019s semi-love interest Keita balances out the outlandish personalities really well, sometimes even putting an abrupt stop to the scene.  Great comedy.  \\n\\n\r\nNothing noteworthy here, just your standard over-the-top sound effects and an eclectic soundtrack to go along with it.  The artwork is pretty stylish, and looks great in 720p.  Lots of color and detail in the environments, and plenty of props given to the character designs\u2026 I mean not a lot of shows can produce a poop demon.  The opening and ending were quite catchy, and gave the eyes a lot to ogle at as far as fanservice goes.  I watched the series in English and full marks can be given to the entire cast of voice actors, each voice was over the top in its own right\u2026 it kind of reminded me of Excel Saga with the exception of Excel herself.  \\n\\n\r\nI normally don\u2019t grade this section individually, but I can truly say standard grading doesn\u2019t do the anime justice.  I\u2019ve seen my fair share of humorous animes, but some of the scenes in Binbougami ga! were so ridiculous, I found myself laughing a few times in every episode.  It was unlike any show I had seen before in regards to delivery.  It\u2019s very quick-witted, and gut punching comedy.  I was actually a bit sad when the anime ended, and look forward to checking out the manga when I have some more time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Good Luck Girl is one original show.  It may not be the best in any one category, or invoke philanthropic debates, but I did enjoy the hell out of it.  I recommend this anime to anyone who needs a break from serious plots or someone who enjoys a good laugh.  Thanks for reading the review!         \\n",

            "content": "Srry this is my first review so It won't be very good:)) and I'll try not to spoil anything.\r\nI'm gonna write a review this time for the manga and currently running anime, Bindougami ga!. The  manga started in 2008 in Jump SQ and the anime is currently airing in the Summer 2012 season.\r\nSo far I gotta say this series has been a big surprise. I never took notice of this series until the anime started airing and from the look of the manga's scalation releases, so did most other people. This series is like a small hidden gem that not many people will takenotice of.\\n\\n\r\nThe story premise is simple. Momiji is a lazy, rude and flat-chested Poverty God who carries bad luck whose mission is to fix the \"imbalance\" in the world caused by Sakura Ichiko; a girl who is considered blessed in every way, brains, beauty and even brawns but have a two-faced, near rotten personality.  Ichiko is very lucky, too lucky; she's even stealing luck from the people surrounding her. Momiji has to stop her from stealing people's luck and to make her a regular human, but it was tougher than expected and so the battle between God and Girl begins .\\n\\n\r\nNow at first this seems like a really regular setting for a manga, well sort of. I didn't expect it to be a slapstick comedy though and to be true, I was pleasantly surprise by it . The series hits me with a very forward style of humor that constantly keeps me on my feet. Most of the comedy comes from the interactions between the cast of characters, at first from mostly the clashes between Momiji and Ichiko but later on from other characters as well. Another aspect of humor is references made by the characters(mostly Momiji) towards other manga and animes, such as One Piece and Dragon Ball and I even saw Doraemon and To-Love-Ru in there. I even thought that they were doing \"It's Over 900000\" before I realized in Japan the meme wasn't that famous.\\n\\n\r\nNow and then there are a few dramatic moments in the series which helps to show the other sides of the cast; such as Ichiko being a lonely and misunderstood girl behind her two-faces and Momiji, who's suppose to be extremely ruthless in her mission to be more compassionate and caring towards her target and rival. They also serve the purpose of progressing the story of the series rather than making it completely filled with jokes and humor. This is a similar formula to a lot of mangas and animes, such as Sora no Otoshimono and Ranma1/2. \\n\\n\r\nThe most important aspect of the series is the cast, which is the main course of the whole thing. At first you are introduced to the I guess main pair of the series, the God & Girl rivals, Momiji and Ichiko. Their personality couldn't be more far apart and that is what drives the series at first. As the series progresses, more character are introduced, with many different personalities and archetypes and this diversifies the moods  of the series.  They're also well developed as most of them had their share of personal back story and dramatic moments that helps them bond with each other, from both the main and supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't a lot of ecchi elements to the series and they're mostly used for laughs rather than fanservice (well it maybe fanservice for some) and it mostly involves poking fun at either Ichiko's breast, Momiji's lack of breast, some small S&M and perverted fantasies by the series' resident perverts.\\n\\n\r\nThe most striking thing and maybe most obvious thing in this cat and mouse game between Momiji and Ichiko all the ironies in it. First is that since Momiji carries a lot of bad luck with her, so really every plan that she hatches against Ichiko will likely fail. Second and maybe the biggest irony of all is that Ichiko was never really happy in her life even though she was blessed with everything; and maybe the real blessing granted upon her, was the God of Misfortune meant to make her life miserable, may actually make her happy.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this series to everyone, you may have to give it a couple of chapters or 1-2 episodes, but trust me you won't regret it.\\n",

The story is also interesting at least better then some of the other's I've seen for this summer.\r\nWell the story is about this INCREDIBLE lucky girl apparently that has too much luck for her own good so the god of misfortune is sent to get a good load of luck from her and make her like any of us unlucky on the world. At firstglance the main charachter seems to be the normal type of populair girl with big breasts and nice charachte  but in reality she's a *****.\\n\r\nThe god of misfortune finds this out the hard way and u can already guess what happens next, Yes a shitload of funny scenes and weird ass moments. Also I must note that I really like the fact that theyre making fun of different anime's just like they do in gintama. The show also has a few drama moments but are quickly changed from depressing/cry/emo moments too Lol wtf funny moments\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think this just might be one of the most enjoyable and funny  anime's that summer has brought us. Seeing as I have watched half of them and only 4 of them were actually good so far and this is one of those 4\\n\\n\r\nGrade 7\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ichigo Sakura is a egotistical girl who seems to have it all; beauty, wealth, intellegence, and athleticism. However this imbalance causes those around her to suffer. It's up to Momiji, a poverty god, to put things back into order by sucking Ichigo's happiness energy out of her. Despite her determination, Ichigo won't give up so easily. Now Ichigo has to put up with Momiji's crazy antics and bad luck devices, along with her supernatural lunatic friends.\r\nGood Luck Girl is hilarious supernatural comedy with a bunch of parody jokes thrown in. These parodies include series such as Rosario Vampire, Dragon Ball, One Piece, and many more!The anime doesn't take itself seriously, which is a good thing. It even often makes fun of itself and even anime in general. The story wasn't too serious, but there was still a plot to follow which made room for many jokes to be thrown in. This is definitely the series for you if you already have watched a good share of anime, so you can get most of the jokes and humor thrown into it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was very eye catching and alluring. Of course it wasn't the best animation I've seen, but it still deserves some props. The character designs were very interesting, especially Momiji's, and it reeally encompases what a poverty god would look like. Also, the art and animation in the opening were fantasticc, and had a pop art feel to it, which really drew me in. The animation was very fluent and neat throughout.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I would reccomend the dub for this series. I feel like there is much more to get out of it while watching the dub. The english voice actors were amazing, as to be expected by actors such as Todd Haberkorn (Momou Inugami) and Brina Palencia (Ichigo Sakura). They seemed to act very natural as if they were experiencing the situations themselves, especially the conversations between Ichigo and Momiji. The whole cast did an amazing job, and the voices matched the characters perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound track for this anime was absolutely spectacular in my opinion, especially the opening song, 'Make My Day' by Pico. It was very fitting, and the opening animation matched the song spectacularly. It was very upbeat and fun, just like the series was. \\n\\n\r\nEach character showed significance and development in this story. Ichigo especially, as she shows a well amount of character development throughout the series. They gave an interesting approach to her character. I expected her to be absolutely despicable and a total brat wwho bullied otthers. However being a dislikeable character, she was different than expected. She actually had no friends or group, and she never really bulied anyone, in fact, she was the one who was being bullied. It was a very unique approach and they really pulled it off.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters in this series were also very interesting and were extremely likeable. Characters like Momiji, Bobby, and Momou, made me laugh out loud several times such as the time were Bobby and Momou sang a song about boobs, or when Momiji cosplays characters from other anime. These characters were extremely loveable and most definitely fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Good Luck Girl gets a 9 out of 10 for personal enjoyment, laugh out loud moments, and cast of characters that were quite loveable. This show was definitely a feel good show, and definitely a show to watch if you feel a bit down or upset. Even just the opening could cheer you up! Or at least 'Make Your Day'. Haha, get it? Anyways, this show is perfect for those who have watched a good amount of anime, and enjoy some laid back humor and a happy tone.",

            "content": "Note: In this review I will be referencing Gintama  from time to time (which I also reviewed), but you can still read this one even if you're not familiar with that show.\r\nAlright, so here we have another wacky comedy/parody from Sunrise. Is it any good? Let's find out.\r\nThis is a spoiler free review (not that there's that much to spoil anyway, lol).\r\n*Story*\r\nStory? What story? \r\nWell\u2026 Ok, it does have a basic premise. It's about a girl who has too much going for her in her life and therefore she has too much good fortune that comes at the expense of others for some reason.As a result, the God of misfortune has come down to balance things out with her powers. \\n\\n\r\nIf you ask me, this is a ridiculous, thin and not so interesting premise (even for a silly comedy). By its own logic, this issue could've been resolved in a matter of two minutes, not 13 episodes. And they just keep coming up with silly excuses for why it hasn't been resolved yet. \\n\\n\r\nNow, having said that, the premise is actually relevant (in one way or another) to most of the events taking place in the series. And is therefore, used properly. Unlike Gintama, which forgot part of its own premise at some point (Odd jobs? What's that??). So even though it's a stupid premise at least it stays true to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself basically consists of\u2026 well mainly just character interactions between the two leads and other characters that are introduced along the way. It also deals with some interesting themes, but certainly not themes that are uncommon in anime and they're pretty light too. It doesn't have much of a storyline either, it's pretty episodic for the most part. Even though the pacing of quite a few of the episodes seem kind of rushed.\\n\\n\r\nThe story concludes in what seems like an anime original ending (I'm not sure, I haven't read the manga). It seemed pretty contrived and rushed, but I admit that it wasn't all that bad for a last minute conflict. Unfortunately though, a lot of things were left open.\\n\\n\r\nNothing much in terms of story, but it's just a comedy so I won't let it impact the score as much as it normally would.\\n\\n\r\n*Characters*\\n\\n\r\nThe characters personalities mostly consist of fast talking hot chicks who speak in foul language. This series basically took the idea of having crazy and violent female characters from Gintama (which is my least favorite aspect of it, tbh), made that the focus, added quite a bit of fan service and also threw in some anime references/parodies.\\n\\n\r\nI personally don't like dirty girls cursing and fighting each other that much, but that's just my personal taste. So objectively, I will give them credit for at least being different from the usual non threatening moe girls we are all too familiar with in school comedies.\\n\\n\r\nI'll also give the characters credit for having backdrops that are quite rich and well handled for such a short series (and a comedy). It really felt like some of the backstories actually mattered and it wasn't just there for the record. Not to mention the interactions themselves that bounce off of each other quite nicely (especially when more characters are introduced, aside from the two leads).\\n\r\nThe main character even develops a little at some point, but it's rushed and not too significant anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yeah, there's another issue with the characters. Due to the pacing being very fast, some episodes are as follows: they introduce a new character - make fun of him/her for most of the duration- and then in the same episode we're also supposed to care about the character and/or feel sorry for him/her. So the mood swings come and go way too fast and the flow of it doesn't feel natural. Sure, at times Gintama does this in a matter of one episode as well, but it did it a lot more eloquently and in an anti-clich\u00e9 manner. And unfortunately this series doesn't stay away from clich\u00e9s as much, so it's not as engaging for that reason too. And some of the stand alone episodes felt like they should've been stretched out in to two..\\n\\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the humor is quite good and a little different from the usual anime humor, but don't expect it to be as clever, funny or unpredictable as it is in Gintama, even though it tries to be (lots of boob jokes too).. But the good part is that it's a lot less random, because it's almost entirely based on character interaction. The anime references do come out of nowhere sometimes and at other times they're placed quite well. Sort of a mixed bag in that respect.\\n\\n\r\n*Art*\\n\\n\r\nThe characters designs are pretty generic. Certainly nothing we haven't seen a million times before. Though some of the clothes designs look pretty cool/sexy.\\n\r\nThe artwork is generally pretty colorful and bright. I don't think it's too detailed for the most part. And the animation seems basic for today's standards. It's certainly not the fluid kind of animation. And it also doesn't have any decent action to make up for that. \\n\\n\r\nSo it's pretty basic in terms of visuals, with the exception of its decent directing. \\n\\n\r\n*Sound*\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is an ok pop song. I didn't like it much and it had Engrish, but it wasn't bad or anything. The ending is also a pop song that sounds better than the opening or at least it sounds a little less generic. Even though it has some Engrish as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are ok, nothing out of the ordinary and the soundrack was fine too and it fit the mood swings ok.. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know Japanese so it's hard to tell, but I think the voice acting is a little over the top at times. But overall it was handled pretty well, I guess. It's probably not the best, but still quite good. Too much screaming, is all..\\n\\n\r\n*Enjoyment*\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy it\u2026 I guess. But I felt like I could've enjoyed it a lot more if it was at least paced better.\\n\\n\r\n*Overall* 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's nothing much in the long run and it could've been a little better, but it's still a decent time waster and certainly above average in comedy. \\n",

Fun and entertaining, but serious when she needs to be.\r\nFor all her life Ichiko has been spoiled and given special treatment above her peers, she always thought it was because she was rich and shedeserved to be treated better than everyone else. Until it turns things bad for the people around her and she learns the truth from Momiji. \\n\r\nHer character is also well done, she's pretty full of herself, but she's funny and easy to like.\\n\\n\r\nIt's definitely a comedy parody. It's really funny and keeps your attention easily. There's a lot of anime references to be found. Especially a lot of Dragonball Z. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of it is Ichiko learning about herself, how to trust people and realizing all the feelings she has been suppressing for a long time. This is what makes it really enjoyable, those deep story points are mixed in perfectly with the constant hilarity. It comes together really smoothly and makes it really nice to watch. \\n\r\nIchiko and Momiji are pretty similar and I think that's why they clash, both want friends and realise all they want to do is to help those close to them.\\n\\n\r\nIt was really fun to watch, I enjoyed it a lot. The ending brought it all together and made it not just a silly series. It has substance and isn't just funny for the hell of it. Ranmaru was the perfect addition to make a weird, but fitting trio. \\n\r\nHopefully there'll be another season, because I'm sure it'll be great just like this one.\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an easy to watch, really funny series, this is a perfect choice.",

If it wasn't for the antagonist, then she'd be stealing the show.  Typical 'do-gooder'? Nah.  She is probably one of the meanest and most selfish protagonists ever and she makes sure to let those who appall her, give them a reason too.  But the main character isn't the only great thing about this show.  The other characters are very fun and likable and, over thecourse of the anime, very very well developed.  The only thing I could say that was meh (but still love it regardless), were the myriad of references to other anime.  I like being the guy to point out \"Holy smokes they just referenced that!\", but I do think they overdid it.  It still doesn't stray from the story of the anime though, not at all.  One of those few goofy anime with a storyline, Binbougami ga! is a beautiful syringe amongst a haystack of gold.",

            "content": "The first anime I completed in 2017 and boy what a way to kick start it.\r\nBinbougami Ga in my opinion is like one of a kind. It is an anime that is supposed to be a parody and you really shouldn't take it too seriously but at the same time, the anime clearly has its own story to tell. So in a way, that helps to provide some weight to the events that happen in the anime. And because it is such, even during moments that are supposed to be dramatic, you can expect a joke to pop up and that prevents it from becomingas depressing as it might have. To me, the balance between light-hearted and serious moments were handled superbly and that is a huge plus for me.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I have to give praise to the anime for developing actual believable backstories for many of the recurring characters. This is especially true in the case of Ichiko, who was revealled that she had some issues back during her childhood. Ichiko being the high and mighty lady type character (these characters who are usually rather annoying and not much attention is given to them) just so happens to be the main character here. And while it is true that she can be rather dislikable because of her attitude towards things, it is obvious that she gained a lot of development throughout the 13 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation done by Sunrise was good but there wasn't anything overly spectacular that caught my attention. But let me just say that there is something about this anime that makes the girls look really sexy, especially Ichiko. So yeah, character designs... check. And I love the accurate depiction of other anime being referenced in it. It was very easy to spot and very well done.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme has always captured my attention because of the chorus part that goes \"One Way, Two Way...\". And while it isn't one of my favourite songs, I'll admit that it was super catchy. The ending theme itself was good. In fact, I might even say that in terms of catchiness, the ending theme might even be better but that's debatable. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall, Binbougami Ga was super fun to watch and I was constantly being amazed by what each episode had to offer. While the anime could still have improved with its storytelling and completing what it had established, it has done more than enough for an anime that technically isn't supposed to be taken seriously. I really enjoyed this anime and I hope to see more of its kind in the future.",

It has plenty of references to other anime, plenty of attempts at fanservice, and plenty of attempts at humor. Unfortunately, most of those attempts fail.\r\nDetailed breakdown below:\r\nStory: 3/10.\r\nWhile the primse isn't horrible, the story eventually forget about the premise completely (and heroine's powers), and large number of references to other anime do not improve it. The issue with references is that in this case they are not fun, feel out of place and the anime being referenced usually is very popular. Supposedly humorous attempts usually fall flat, and the story attempts to shiftits mood all over the place. Basically, the events are never convincing or interesting to watch, and it looks like a collection of more or less randomly stitched together scenes. There are also too many screens with manga-style gags, like when a character explains some sort of new \"gadget\" in silly voice.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nSurprisingly good. Characters look nice, and have style different from standard cookie cutter modern \"triangular face\" anime. Animation is good, when it happens (meaning when cahracters aren't busily explaining something.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10:\\n\r\nSoundtrack and voice acting works well enough, and there isn't much to add.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10:\\n\r\nEvery single character is highly stereotypical and unbelievable. I think the only interesting ones were Ranmaru and certain cat, and that's it. Character's behavior is highly inconsistent for the duration the series, and they pretty much flip mood to something completely different to go along with the plot. Interactions are very often cringeworthy.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoymenet: 4/10:\\n\r\nDidn't really like it and felt like I should've watched something else instead.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nWhile the visuals are nice, I can't recommend it. The anime could've been much better, but storywriting and attempts at inserting anime references ultimately ruined it.\\n\\n\r\nThe best idea is to skip it, although you may want to check out few first episodes and see if you can handles this anime's weak storywriting. Visuals are good, I'm just not sure if enduring the story is worth seeing them. Of course, there are worse out there, but still, this is not an incredibly good show.",

If you are like me, and won't understand some of the many metaphors and portrayals this anime holds there's no need for disappointment or worry, the original humor, story, characters and their actions substantiates for that.\r\nI particularly loved the voice acting, I thinkthey were perfect especially for Momiji and Sakura, the random exaggerations and exclamations got me good.\\n\r\nThe sound effects were not overly-exaggerated and fit just fine, the art is not displeasing but not perfect either, however the characters were great and fit perfectly with their voices and attitudes.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't find any particularly overbearing qualities in Binbougami ga! and it's right along the road for some  shits&giggles, however, contrary to the previous mentions of crude humor and buoyant characters this anime presents some real-life elements like the aspects of sharing, friendship and selflessness which the main character gradually learns about in the most unexpected and testing ways.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think Binbougami ga! has many redeeming qualities and is definitely worth a watch, it has the ability to entertain the viewer with displays of obscene humor while managing to pose the question of morality in the most lighthearted and unexpected way.",

            "content": "First of all if you have not seen this anime and want a comedy that can give you 10/10 enjoyment this anime is one of your best options. You ask why? Come on ,just think about it , an anime based on a plot that is hilarious to just even think about , it would be one of the best comedies there are to watch. This anime does not take any time for understanding, just watch one or two episodes and you are hooked! .This anime is a must watch if you ask me.\r\nA god of misfortune is sent to earth to extract the fortunefrom a girl who is disrupting the balance of the world by (unintentionally) absorbing the fortune from the people in her surroundings; due to her excessive power of good luck and fortune. Coincidentally, that god is also a girl visually in the same age as the girl; also if you see her, you are not going to accept the very fact that she is a god, LOL. The god makes a wrong entrance (suddenly appears in the bathroom) and leaves a bad impression on the girl and thus starts an EPIC battle between the god of misfortune and the girl \u2026.. The girl has excessive amount of luck and fortune so she can compete with the god! Also the god has to buy different gadgets in order to set traps for the girl .To do so, god has to earn money.  This makes the situation more difficult in other words more funny. \\n\r\nEpisodes: Only 13.\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 (Great)\\n\r\n  If you are thinking why I am talking about sound as my first topic of concern, then here is my answer, I loved its sound and music. Starting and Ending themes are really cool, I liked them and especially the ending theme song is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10 (Good)\\n\r\n  The story is not bad .Usually, comedies do not have very effective plot and they just turn in any direction regardless of the consequences and bad effects on the main story but this anime has a really   good plot not to mention it is still extremely hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\n Of course this anime is one of the best sources of enjoyment for me. I just downloaded its first two episodes and watched them, to my astonishment, I was hooked! BEST ENJOYMENT EVER! Just one episode is almost enough for a day (as far as enjoyment matters).\\n\\n\r\nArt and Character Design: 7/10 (Good) \\n\r\n For a comedy, its art is awesome. Character design is just great. Characters are uniquely made and their reactions and impressions completely match to the situation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10 (Very Good)\\n\r\n  This anime is really good especially when it comes to its characters. Unique characters are used and they perform extremely well .Each character has a distinctive personality, I say \u2026\u2026WELL MADE. Each character makes a perfect entrance and makes the story more fun as well as interesting. Also characters have fairly understandable back stories.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 (Great)\\n\r\n  This anime is a rare piece of work .Only 13 episodes, does not take much time and it is OF COURSE worth watching. I have never been so much impressed from a comedy. So, all I would say is that I enjoyed it. I don\u2019t regret a bit for watching it.\\n",

Not every story like these one can balance those two elements well. Parodies are well executed.\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\r\nThere interesting and really inspiring character development for the female protagonist is something to look forward to. And, she might not admit it but it all thanks to the other main character. These two main characters probably have one of the most unique, inspiring, and fun relationship. The titular main character is given to be the most interesting; not only is she hilarious but can reallygive serious advices.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ENJOYMENT\\n\r\nIt\u2019s the best with parodies next to Gintama which is the God of parodies. It definitely made me love \u201cparodies\u201d even more. It\u2019s not just all comedy and funny moments but the story definitely has substance. And like some of my favorite series with very few episodes; it\u2019s extremely irritating that it only have 12 episodes despite how amazing the stories is.\\n",

            "content": "A pretty lightweight affair, one that didn\u2019t particularly entertain me but didn\u2019t throw me off to the point of making me stop watching it either.\r\nJust as Pokemon\u2019s super-talented villains that always fail to capture Pikachu, the Poverty God, Momiji, invariably fails to take Sakura Ichiko\u2019s \u201chappiness energy\u201d despite her godly powers. The anime gets repetitive after a while because every episode pans out almost the same way, just with different settings and minor characters. Seeing the same pattern unfold over and over wasn\u2019t all that great an experience for me.\r\nThat said, episodes 10-13 take an entirely different turn from the usual, though I\u2019m not sureif that was any more successful. For an R-rated fare (in Japan anyway), the anime felt strangely childish, despite the all-too-often gratuitous nudity and sexual jokes.\\n\\n\r\nThe story had potential, and it could\u2019ve no doubt benefited from being told in a more subtle and mature way, which is why the anime\u2019s approach was disappointing. There\u2019s a teenage girl who is spoiled and selfish because of her excess wealth and beauty. In comes a god, who wants to take away the girl\u2019s good luck. The girl resists strongly and seemingly manages to keep all her good luck to herself, but through her time with the god, she slowly and gradually becomes a changed woman, one who is able to share her luck with others when need be. You could say the god is an anime-style interpretation of a girl\u2019s inner growth.\\n\\n\r\nI realize that I\u2019m not the anime\u2019s target demographic. I rarely ever watch animes (no worries, the irony of me joining this website certainly didn\u2019t escape me), so I\u2019m not familiar with a lot of the numerous other animes it pokes fun at. The more you know, the more you see; so perhaps those who are well versed in Japanese animes may find this enjoyable. For me, though, it was pretty mediocre.\\n\\n\r\np.s. I wish the anime had spent more time on the Poverty God, Momiji, because I liked her character design and felt she had too little screen time of her own.\\n",

            "content": "Binbougami ga! is an anime I've been wanting to watch for a while now, and while I had the time to, I decided 'Why not?' and gave it a look.\r\nAs expected from Sunrise, this anime contains a lot of parodies from other anime, such as Prince of Tennis, Death Note, and many many more! Despite all the comedy in it, this anime teaches you a very good life lesson. You might be rich, you might have all the money and fortune in the world, and all the best looks, but if you're arrogant; like in this case the main character Sakura Ichiko is, you willend up all alone with a lot of fake friends who just are there because of your status.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime revolves around a girl called Sakura Ichiko who apparently has too much fortune for this world, and she can unconciously suck fortune out of other people, making them unfortunate, and most likely a bad event happening in a few seconds, but she isn't known of this until Momiji, a god of misfortune comes by. This god of misfortune is assigned a mission to stop this imbalance of fortune somehow, and she does everything she could. The story was very well-paced for a 13 episode anime, and everything was explained very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was simply outstanding, not deserving of a 10, but the detail put in each character was simply amazing. I loved looking at each expression the character would do and most of them, especially the parodies were hilarious and left me laughing my ass off for a whole episode! \\n\\n\r\nFor once I actually ended up listening to the opening and the ending each episode since they were so enjoyable, and even the OSTs were on spot for each scene, making the anime more enjoyable than it already is.\\n\\n\r\nI was watching this anime with very high standards on me, and those standards were surpassed by loads. Each character was very lovable and fun to watch, especially Momiji and Sakura Ichiko, the two main characters. The side characters like the priest, the dog and many others were so fun to watch, I haven't enjoyed side characters as well for a long time now, so this was fresh air for me.\\n\\n\r\nI could say that I enjoyed this anime a lot, especially because Sunrise is my favorite company, and if they ever do a season 2 (Binbougami ga! Darkness LOL), I will be very looking forward to it, though it's probably one of Sunrise's usual trolls lol.\\n\\n\r\nAs a person who was very depressed a while ago, this anime cheered me up a lot by just watching it, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants an amazing comedy with tons of hilarious parodies inside.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking your time to read my review!",

If you're on the fence about watching this (as I was) I'll say it now: take the plunge. Every single episode made me laugh out loud, and 11 or 12 of the 13 episodes I could genuinely describe as 'outrageously funny.' \r\nThough Binbougami-ga!? falls short of a being a true comedic masterpiece, it still left me feeling like I had hit the comedy jackpot. Sure, there are underdeveloped/extraneous/trite characters I feelI could do without (Bobby, Momo-o), and sure, the plot is not exactly a fine-tuned machine, but Binbougami-ga?! delivers laughs time and again over the course of 13 episodes, to the point where its entertainment value far outshines its other shortcomings.\\n\\n\r\nMomiji and Ichiko are wonderful foils for each other, and the later addition of characters like Rindo Ranmaru only adds to this. To be sure, Momiji and Ranmaru have both wormed their way into my top-10 favorite characters.\\n\\n\r\nI mean...without getting too spoiler-y, I'm just going to tell you to watch the damn thing! I don't regret a minute; in fact my only regret is that it's only 13 episodes long!",

Binbougami Ga!, a series about a girl who has the most fortune in existence is preyed upon by a god of Misfortune. Basically, the god has to balance out Sakura Ichiko's fortune to an acceptable level or whoever she makes friends with or just passes by with sheer coincidence, their bad luck triples which causes some massive headaches for the god herself. Armed with an over-sized needle as her right arm, she tries to suck out a good portion of Sakura's fortune to level her out. Butthrough happenstance, she always manages to replenish herself by the end of the day. On a scale of one to ten, this series holds a lot moral issues which Sakura must face if she is to become more human than she is now. Which is to say, a mere shallow, attractive, flippant, narcissistic, egomaniac, and many other kinds of negative qualities a rich girl has. But her other good self is starting to come out in various microscopic amounts. With this is mind, maybe her fortune will turn for the better once she realizes what it means to be fully human. I love this series, with the laughs, the slapstick violence, the crude humour, and the way the story revolves around a girl who is as lonely as a leper on devils island. Refreshing show. Not for kids. But highly recommended for the above age.",

            "content": "This is my first review so have mercy on thine soul. Okay, Binbougami ga!, here we go. This damn anime is pure fun and entertainment at its finest just to get that off my chest. \r\nOk, so this story is basically about a girl who is called Sakura who has too much luck and a god of misfortune and their overall adventures. I gotta say, when i first heard about this i thought hell is this going to be some kid flick and like most of you who will read this  review who are guys, i know yall checked simply because of the pictureand it looked appealing, well i am here to verify to you my friends, the picture does say a thousand words because, this anime is PURE CHAOS. I aint seen so much drama and madness since nisemonogatari and i fell in love with this anime almost as much as i did that one. So i say unto you my friends, if you like parodies and chaos and if you liked nisemonogatari, watch this or at least give it a chance.\\n\\n\r\nFor a comedy, I loved how they incorporated the parodiies while getting the core parts of the story development across. It wasnt pure randomness with no meaning but it directed what it wanted to have come across. Most of the comedy comes from allusions as stated earlier. Rarely does an episode go by that will not make you laugh or cry to the point that you might have acid reflux. That being said, if you are not into the sheer madness and randomness and utter unrealistic fantasies, this anime will try to direct to you as well as it does attempt after the first few episodes around 3 episodes or so to direct you with a real story. \\n\\n\r\nOne point I HAVE TO BRING ACROSS is the voice acting. OH MY GOD, the way how Kana Hanazawa and Yumi Uchiyama as Ichiko and Momiji coordinate, you really get the feling that they are sisters having a conversation at home or friends that have known each other for years. They if for anything made this anime a success because my God they are awesome and make you truly appreciate the essence of doing something that you love simply because you love doing it.\\n\\n\r\nSunrise studios has been the love of my life for years, especially after Geass, oh C.C how i miss you so. Their art and animation is most of the time so damn clean and efficient that you feel like such a boss watching their beautiful quality. You will be able to tell that the graphics workers had alot of fun as will you watching this anime as they did working on it as the art is godlike, especially the opening and the ending.\\n\\n\r\nLastly for the music, my God did i love the opening and the ending. They truly caught the randomness of the anime and I am thankful for them doing it so well. I sang eccentricly as would a child after sucking a lollipop for hours. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I give binbougami ga an 8.75/10 and I strongly recommend for all. It is lovely and I hope that you enjoy it as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nOTAKU FOR LIFE. cheers.",

Then, I search it as I read the synopsis I found it interesting. The story is simple, hilarious, parody and whimsical despite that it has a lesson. The character design is unique and vibrant. I like the ending song. The seiyuu also did a good job of switching from serious to different characters. The character's personality is humorous. Overall, I did enjoy watching this anime somehow it is a female version of Gintama. So, if youlike the Gintama you would also like this one.",

            "content": "Here's a quick and super original synopsis about this show. \r\n- This is a world where there are god for everything, it usually take form of a human with clothing that cosplay for what they represents. \r\n- Our MC is a gril, and she's one of those narcissist, selfish, short temper women; who's rich, got em big titties, and liked by all men in school. And she was blessed with fortune (that rivals even a god)  that was taken from taking other people's. \r\n- so to counter that, a god of misfortune who's the diametric opposite of our MC came to teaches her alesson, as well as, taking her ability to steal fortune from other people. To basically save their lives and future apparently.\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, this anime was somewhat a funny series. The only jokes that i actually laugh my ass off is when they does their parody (jojo, death note etc.), that bobby dude lmao (he's black) and when the purple hair girl that appear after the ending song appears with her short dialogue and a fucking did u saw me in the episode quiz lmao. Other than that, most of their jokes aren't even funny, but it's still a somewhat hilarious show because it's just so fucking random. \\n\\n\r\nAnd i wouldn't say that this is all there's to it to this show. The other great thing, but definitely way better than its comedy is the presenting themes of morality, materialistic vs non materialistic, necessity vs happiness etc. And some romance in them too. \\n\\n\r\nThe character are just pretty likable as well. And there are some pretty good dialogue, arguing about one's character (our MC) that's oppose to the idea of universal happiness for others, and happiness that's limited to the self. I may have sentenced this alittle too philosophical here. But to be exact, this anime does talks about such a thing which is pretty interesting given that the theme is strongly used in this anime, as a way to contribute to its seriousness and the character development of our naive, and arrogant/selfish MC to open her eyes to help others. And it done this pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nSo pretty much, this anime is pretty good, it has somewhat funny moment and other moment that's genuinely funny, and this is prolly the first time that i have seen Hanazawa, Kana playing these kind of personality in an anime. Which is pretty refreshing to see her voicing osme other things that doesn't involve sounding fucking kawaii all the time. It's pretty ironic that the comedy doesn't live up to its greatly presented themes when the anime turns serious, despite being a show solely dedicated to being a comedy. But this shit is a good show.Give this anime a go.",

            "content": "I was very hesistant to watch this anime initially. It sounded like a typical ecchi bad-plotline anime that ployed around stupid humor to get its point across. Which, to a less harsh extent, it did do. However, I actually ended up loving this anime quiet alot because it was just such an odd mix of stupid humor\\parody\\heartwarmedness (thats a word, right?). If you are an asshole hipster anime critic...well then, you'll probably hate this with all your guts. But if you are a lenient avid anime lover, and can handle fanservice, then you will not regret watching this.\r\nThe story-Ok, I'll give it that the storywas actually pretty bland. It wasn't exactly the most intellectual as it did have a pretty stupid premise, but, on the other hand, seeing as this was a parody anime, i think maybe they also wanted to make fun of the stupid plotlines 3\\4's of comedies have. It was never honestly greatly annoying, however, because this anime is hard to take seriously, aside from its really heartwarming moments. I'll give it a 5 out of 1O simply because, although not bothersome, it was actually a really stupid premise.\\n\\n\r\nThe art-It's hard for me to really judge art as huge factor in my enjoyment of the anime because I typically see it as a bonus unless they excel at the artwork. The character designs were actually perfect in molding the characters image (e.g, Ichiko being a bonbacious breasted rich snob, or atleast initially), and for that I give it an 8 out of 1O.\\n\\n\r\nSound-The intro is really fun and poppy, however...the outro sounds like alvin and the chipmunks reincarnated into a little japanese girl. Thankfully the intro is enough to outweight this, however, so it still recieves a strong 6 out of 1O.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-Call the characters one sided, flat, whatever, they are still amazingly enjoyable. Yes they all have major niche roles they never deviate from (e.g, the poverty god being a tomboyish typical teenage girl with a flaring hate for ichiko) but they play them roles so well its as if the maker lived as these characters for a day just to perfect them. Plus most of the characters are actually really loveable and will grow on to you (especially Ranmaru). They only one who undergoes major character development is of course, our main character, ichiko, however they are all very loveable. A strong 9 out of 1O for characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-Overall a really fun goofball of anime, even goofier if you get the parody references. I was laughing nearly the entire time and for that, an outstanding 1O out of 1O.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (for critics only)-8 out of 1O. But this score really doesn't mean anything.",

Binbougami manage to mix the story and character development to the parody which made things better.\r\nStory - 8\r\nBinbougami story is simple. Beside from whats written on the synopsis, it also deals with everyday life of Sakura Ichiko. While it seems to be simple, that didnt appear to be as simple as it is for the MC of this show is a loner. To put it simply, the story of Binbougami is more like the story of a very fortunate lonely girl learn to interact with other people while being keep in watch by a God of Misfortune.\\n\\n\r\nIt is also to take note the amount of parody this anime has. The parody on this anime mostly use as a comedy but unlike any other parody, the parody here match the atmosphere of the events like using Dragonball parody for introducing the characters. It is also very interesting that the 2 most memorable anime Spirited Away and Death Note used as well for the parody.\\n\\n\r\nSongs - 8\\n\\n\r\nCatchy. Well the songs on Binbougami has its own merits. Like its opening song, its very catchy and thanks to that catchy song, it helps to improve the atmosphere of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending song of the other hand shows the hate/love relationship between Ichiko and Momiji. Which sounds cute. Yeah it sounds cute case of the beat of the song and even the translation of the lyrics makes it cute as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7\\n\\n\r\nThe best way to describe this part is this resemble Seto no Hanayome characters. Yes it totally resemble Seto no Hanayome when it comes to the characters. Even the character development resembles Seto no Hanayome.\\n\\n\r\nIn case those who read this review havent seen Seto no Hanayome, its a romcom anime that has characters as one of its strong factor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\\n\r\nThis never failed to make me laugh so I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for comedy anime.\\n\\n\r\nHope that this opinion of mine is helpful.",

            "content": "My first review goes to Binbougami Ga! because it's that worth it. So without further ado, let's start! \r\nI'm going to just throw it out there: This anime is completely UNDERRATED. It should get more attention than this, especially if you're a sucker for comedy like me. It's not just your average kind of comedy either though, it's the \"what the f**k just happened!?\" kind, that'll keep you laughing throughout the episode. If you're contemplating on whether or not to watch this, google it right now and start streaming it immediately. Trust me, it's more than worth it. \r\nStill not convinced?\r\nOkay let's go over thegrading then.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\r\nPlot wise, it's pretty simple, protagonist has too much luck and the God of Misfortune wants to take some of it to restore the balance. I gave it a score of 8 since it consistently follows this plot throughout the series. Of course going off tangent every now and then for the skits and other shenanigans; only to make it more enjoyable of course!\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nThe artwork is really nice, great enough to the point where I spend a chunk of the time pausing the anime to study how it was drawn. (I'm an amateur self-taught artist) The background sceneries are also something worth marveling over; they must have paid some good money for this. Wink, wink. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nOpening was quite upbeat and adorable and if I didn't scurry onto the next episode, I normally left the ending to play and I never felt the urge to mute it. Voice acting was great as well, voices matched the emotions and were in tune with the characters, giving them depth and allowing them to come to life. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9\\n\r\nNormally in an anime there's always that one character you loathe because of their annoying nature or heinous role ... but no matter who it was, I grew to sympathize for each character. I found them all lovable in their own way and the interaction between them cracks you up. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this a score of 9! Hopefully you give this anime a chance and enjoy it.",

UNTIL a Poverty god, Momiji, enters tasked with the unimaginable hard mission to rid this girl from her good luck, of course she fights back and in return a HILARIOUS battle turnsout...And to put the cherry on top the little girl starts to fall in love with someone leading to a juicy story, most certainly.\\n\\n\r\nIn between this absolute chaos the anime includes some parody scenes from other anime's like Naruto, One Piece and many more.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the very good anime art and illustrations I like this anime because the story line is very good planned out and the anime really allows viewers to connect with the characters and what they experience. \\n\\n\r\nBelieve me watching this anime will surely cheer anybody up and make your day.

            "content": "Bimbougami ga! Is a story abou Sakura Ichiko , a girl with an excessive  amount of Luck is being hunted  by Momiji, the god of misfortune. Momiji\u0081's mission was to take all the excessive Luck  of Ichiko because she have this ability of draining the luck of the people around her and adding it to her own, thus the battle between the two started coz Ichiko doesn\u0081't want to give up her luck. I\u0081'm in Momiji\u0081's side all thru the series, because of Ichiko\u0081's attitude and personality which I hate the most out of her. \r\n\tMy expectation is high in this anime,but when i started watching it, I got depressed because it doesn't have anything new to offer to me. The only reason that i watched this was because it\u0081's a comedy anime and I love to laugh, but all i got was same old slapstick comedy and parodies. After going thru all 12 episodes, I realized that i never laughed or remembered if I laughed and all the comedy scenes was forgettable for not having enough punch .  The good thing was that the story is not that boring that I never feels like falling asleep while watching.   \\n\r\n\tI love to re-watch comedy anime, but my verdict is that this anime is good for one time watch only. \t\\n",

That resulted in a lot of time wasted on character development, and even so she remains, arguably, one of the worst characters in the show.

There are several different kinds of humor: slapstick, references to other anime, 4th wall jokes,  puns, parody, some \"lewd\" humor, and more. There is also one amazing reference to Dragon Ball Z in every episode, and they only get better as the show goes on. So if you are a fan of DBZlike I am, these references will be a highlight of the show. In addition to some great humor, the show also know when it needs to be more serious and develop the characters. Although this show is pretty episodic, you do get the sense that our lead character is  changing throughout the shows run.\\n\r\nGood Luck Girl is a hilarious show, it has a nice group of characters, and a surprising amount of emotion and development despite the series' limited run.",

            "content": "***THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW***\r\nLately I have found it harder and harder to find anime that I honestly feel makes me really \"laugh out loud\" or really enjoy warming up to a character I previously hated. The show Binbougami ga! has somehow incorporated both of these aspects into a fun filled thirteen episode running.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nNo sugarcoating this category; being a slice of life and self contained episodic type show means there really isn't a whole lot of ways to have an interesting show especially since it is a parody anime that in my opinion rivals Gintama in how funny it comes off to be.The story follows Ichiko Sakura, the god of misfortune Momiji, and their rag tag friends as they progress through many different situations. The main premise of the show is that Ichiko absorbs all the \"fortune\" around her and it is making everyone else miserable. To fix this, Momiji is sent in to absorb Ichiko's fortune but she finds out fairly quickly that pretty much all of her efforts are in vain as Ichiko's fortune out powers Momiji's misfortune. Like most other comedy anime though the enjoyment is not in the plot, it is in the character interactions. Also there is fanservice in this anime but please do not let that make you shy away from this show. The absolute gold this show presents is in the character interactions and comedy.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile it is not the most eyegasmic anime I have seen, the characters were drawn and animated very, very well. All of the characters literally seem to shine when on screen and all of their motions are captured very well. The background and action shots were particularly done well and yes even the obligatory fanservice episode was totally worth any wait. Speaking of fanservice, there is a lot of it in this show but not in the whole almost naked sense. Like other shows there seems to be characters dedicated for getting any ecchi pun/joke started and in this show it happens to be a black monk (Bobby) and a dog/whatever thing that likes S&M (Momou). I will go out on a limb and state that while some of the fanservice might be a little over the top, I would not turn this away only because of that aspect.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nBeing a sound guy in my spare time (lots of home recording), I am quite torn on the sound of this show. While the music seemed very fitting and the voice actors did an amazing job, I cannot help but be bothered by some of the audio quality of Ichiko in particular. For some reason some of her lines sounded like they were recorded in a really cheap closet with no sound dampening what so ever. I am not sure if this was just this particular voice actor's performance but regardless it was enough to kind of annoy me.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI'll attempt to relay my thoughts on the characters without going into total fanboyism but the short and sweet version is one of the best casts I have ever seen. The characters alone are not that interesting since they are typical cookie cutter personas but together as a whole they have a lot of chemistry and prove this by making me laugh unbelievable amounts. Being a parody show, you do somewhat have to know of the anime they are portraying but if you have seen the most popular ones you should be able to get most of the jokes. Regardless if you understand them or not, the show is funny enough on its own to keep you around for all thirteen episodes. Another great point about the show was how I eventually warmed up to Ichiko. Initially I really disliked her character as she really came off as a selfish bi#%@ but as the show progressed, you see a noticeable change in her character's values. I eventually really liked her as a person and of course her...assets. Just the way the characters interact with each other was such a joy to encounter. I am glad though that the anime was only thirteen episodes long as I feel if it was any longer, some of the gags would of started to run pretty dry.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show was just what I needed; a fresh and surprise blast. I had seriously been dragging my tail around with anime due to the total un-interest in this season's offerings but I am very glad that I took the time to go through my \"want to watch\" list to sniff this one out. If you want a carefree and total laugh out loud show to watch then look no further.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.3/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",
