            "content": "Watching Kyoukai no Kanata is like riding a train but as it moves, it goes down spiral, into the abyss, and finally reaches trainwreck at the shadow of the pit. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the show has quite an promising premise with the style of a dark fantasy genre. It\u2019s something that Kyoto Animation haven\u2019t tried before in the past so Kyoukai no Kanata should set its par high with this new style, right? Wrong. This series is fails at various levels and if you\u2019re expecting a deep engaging story with well developed characters, then look somewhere else. It doesn\u2019t break any boundary or gobeyond its generic setting. Instead, it presents a story that is almost laughable. And no, I\u2019m not laughing.\\n\\n\r\nKyoukai no Kanata is an animated series based off the light novel of the same name written by Nagomu Torii. (artwork: Tomoyo Kamoi) The series takes a new turn by adapting the style of dark fantasy in a modern time era involving a group of students whom seems normal at first but contains a dark secret. That secret being that some of them are not human but instead are gifted with abnormal abilities. They use those abilities to save people and combat against the youmu. Ironically, one of the main characters is half youmu but finds himself fighting on the side of humanity as he embraces his destiny. \\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation is known for animating various titles with a school life setting but rarely ever incorporates the usage of actual supernatural themes into them with touch of darkness or despair. Series such as Hyouka, Chuunibyou, and the recently Free all never ventured into the supernatural zone that bought viewers to attention. Now finally in this show, there\u2019s actual otherworldly elements that and fans should be grateful for. The initial premise also brings forth a promising start with its small cast of characters and plot. It starts out with an attempted suicide by a young girl named Mirai Kuriyama. After saving her, we witness strange events among its residents as the world they know it becomes a distorted by supernatural entities that threatens their very own existence.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of the series takes place in a modern time era with the typical school life of our characters. Among our main characters includes Akihito Kanbara, a half-human and half-youmu with a gifted ability of regeneration, Mirai Kuriyama with the talent of blood manipulation, the spirit warrior Mitsuki Nase, and her older brother Hiiromi Nase. These four characters makes the ingredients of this show that give Kyoukai no Kanata its odd flavor. Most of them hardly connect at all with their lack of characterization. Almost all their conversations lacks any sort of dynamics but is instead replaced with irrational jokes, meaningless development, and overall a fragile depth. None of the characters stands out on their own either. Mirai is decorated with adorableness that is further evidenced by those noticeable round glasses, petite figure, and nerviness around others. Perhaps also colored as a natural klutz, there is almost nothing that stands out with her being part of this series. On the other hand, Akihito makes more of a presence but for absurd reasons such as his glasses fetish and preposterous humor. His relationship with Mirai is quite empty and can hardly be noticeable at all. In fact, there is hardly any romance between the duo nor any depth. They seem to exist the complete opposite together like oil and water. The Nase siblings aren\u2019t any interesting either considering their constant bickering and Hiiromi\u2019s heavily implied sister complex. \\n\\n\r\nThis series\u2019 overall plot execution should be considered a travesty of justice. The plot has many holes that are left wide open thanks to the way of its execution. The way most of the characters are part of the series\u2019 plot often ends in what I can see as rushed sequences. Conflicts are resolved abruptly without proper morals. Back stories seems interesting at first but overall lacks any depth or interest because it\u2019s hard to relate to the characters. This is also shown with the way characters are designed. Mirai is a prominent example as her history with a certain character of the series left her with \u201cscars\u201d. However, her present character shows little to none of those scars until confronted directly. Even afterwards, her interactions with that character is seemingly blushed off as just another event in her past life; a rushed one at that as well. There\u2019s also hardly any depth into the story except sticking with the concept of fighting youmu and saving people. This doesn\u2019t always go in the way they want either with one particular episode that becomes an absurd parody with dancing aesthetics. Least to say, Kyouki no Kanata didn\u2019t go beyond the boundary. It didn\u2019t hit anywhere near home because of its poor writing and construction. There are backstories and reasoning revealed later on but to save them near its ending phases and makes viewers to wait patiently doesn\u2019t cut out right.\\n\\n\r\nAction wise, the series is executed well thanks to Kyoto Animation\u2019s fluid execution.  Scenes involving fighting are presented with rapid movements accompanied by its majestic atmosphere. Mirai\u2019s rare ability also spills blood that marks the trace of its grim reality of dark fantasy. The youmu race also present a supernatural feel of explicit malevolence because of their existence; it is mentioned that youmi exists as result of negative emotions. Because of this, they spread that negative influence towards others.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the show being dark and perhaps explores a more psychological side to its story, the series also contains comedy. Unfortunately, the presentation and delivery of that comedy is laughable in the wrong way. There is little chemistry in the way dialogues are delivered because the character interactions of this series lacks depth. Mirai\u2019s character is generic with her annoying catchphrase that fits perfectly with its uninteresting style. The implied sister complex throughout the series becomes a distraction that\u2019s hard to take seriously. And although the series avoid the typical beach episode, it doesn\u2019t evade its poor parody or oddly coordinated fan service scenes. If the series wants us to take it seriously, then it should follow that pattern. But if it wants to make a few jokes here and then, it should at least make sense. Nonetheless, it follows down a path of despair with no decent delivery. I honestly don\u2019t know what went wrong here. Perhaps it's because of the director Taichi Ishidate but he was known to deliver series such as Full Metal Panic: Second Raid that actually explored psychological of despair. Here, the direction is off and the timing is misplaced in many of its moments. Overall, it\u2019s hard to take this show seriously despite its dark genre as it sometimes falls into the slice of life zone, other times with some story depiction ending in senseless solutions. You\u2019ll see some of this yourself if you decide to give the series a try. It\u2019s almost like dichotomy and becomes intolerable. \\n\\n\r\nThanks to Kyoto Animation\u2019s production values, it\u2019s safe to say that the series is saved in some ways by its scenery and visuals. The artwork for this show is magnificent with rich depth in terms of visual production. Most of the youmu gives off their threatening appearance that makes them a dangerous adversary for the Spirit Warriors. The character designs are typical with Kyoto Animation involved such as Mirai\u2019s dose of moe. Mitsuki\u2019s character gives off her coldness towards most of the others that is a reflection to the way she looks. Background wise, everything fits well and makes sense when the series decides to venture into the dark fantasy region. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is consistent with its tone. Because the series takes on a dark fantasy theme, it adapts a more eerie OST. Comedy wise though, there are moments when the OST loses balance of itself thanks to its poor execution. The action scenes incorporates good usage of its soundtrack especially with the intense atmosphere it gives off. Likewise, more emotional scenes makes decent usage of its OST to reflect the mood. Both the OP and ED songs also gives off a soft pacing for its mood. Mirai\u2019s VA (Risa Taneda) plays her role well that fits the voice of a shy character. Others such as Mitsuki and Akihito also are consistent with their voice mannerisms.\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, this series didn\u2019t meet the expectations I had in mind. The initial premise had potential. Unfortunately, the characters becomes a major problem with their lack of characterization, interactions, and personalities. Most of the plot/arc hardly makes any sense especially with their resolutions. This doesn\u2019t help by the fact that there is a improper timing with comedic scenes or dialogues. Instead, the dialogues usually falls apart with odd conversations such as involving the male characters\u2019 fetishes. The technical aspect of this show is decent in terms of production especially with its powerful visuals courtesy of Kyoto Animation. The action scenes also makes up a decent base for shounen like battles with touches of dark fantasy. However, this doesn\u2019t excuse the ultimatum of the show being mediocre. \\n\\n\r\nAs Mirai would write in her blog that she often gets flamed for, I would also say that Kyoukai no Kanata/Beyond the Boundary is best concluded with \u201chow unpleasant\u201d.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Damn, I feel like one of the few people who really really loves Kyoukai no Kanata on this damn site. I guess it's explaining time because as I really really like it I want it to have a halfway decent review. (especially since most of these seem written from a bias perspective from someone who only watched the first 3 episodes.\r\nKyuokai is not perfect, but it makes up for a lot of its flaws with gorgeous animation good laughs and a completely enjoyable ride the whole way through. The story of KnK definitely isn't original in the slightest to start off. Like everyone is sayingsupernatural girl meets immortal boy and they fall in love, and while people may whine that unoriginality just leads to a total shit fest I think that if something works and is enjoyable that's what matters the most, and while originality is always a plus (like in SnK's case) it is not necessary for a good anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhere KnK shines is in it's art and it truly is breathtaking. There are so many scenes that evoke emotions beautifully and really just make it an artistic masterpiece in it's own right. It's one of those anime that could be absolutely terrible and the art alone could save it. Luckily the rest is not terrible it's all at least acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nThe character's and character development are also high points in this anime. The characters all interact very realistically even if they are reused tropes. The animations of the characters face in a particular scene helps portray the emotions in that respective character in a very real well that leaves it so that there is no need for talking and there is a lot of silence in this anime that leaves the watcher to just look at the beautiful scenery which is where KnK shines the most and it definitely knows it does. The characters also develop so well having episodes where characters slowly become closer to each other instead of leaving it to be implied and that's a very good thing. (Funny enough a lot of people see these episodes as \"filler\" episodes, I do not agree, but maybe I'm just more optimistic and think Kyoani is smarter than that)\\n\\n\r\nAnother very enjoyable aspect of KnK is the level of mysticism it portrays and even if it is an overused overarching story it does a very good job at not feeling stale in the slightest. I believe it does this best through the soundtrack which is absolutely stunning and great to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nMany people are shit talking the story in KnK and I believe that while it is partially justified it also partially isn't because KnK isn't linear. There isn't one story and it seems to fly by very fluidly instead of feeling like there is X arc then X arc it just feels like it passes very nicely. The pacing feels nice and it's overall just very enjoyable to get through.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end KnK is enjoyable, the art is great and the characters and story feel to flow very well. There are flaws and those are not to be ignored; however, it is DEFINITELY not nearly as bad as people like to think it is. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will feel satisfied at the end of it.",

            "content": "\"Judgement prevent us from seeing the good that lies beyond appearances.\"\r\n-Wayne Dyer\r\nThere is one thing I will rarely, if ever, do. That is give the show a rating before watching the entire show through. That doesn't mean that I don't have preconceived notions about the show and have some idea how I'm going to rate it. As a human being, I am flawed with the inability to look at something objectively from the beginning. That being said, I felt like I should take the time to address all the people somehow climbing over each other trying to stick his or her opinion down the throat'sof other people. Here is my humble opinion: Kyoukai no Kanata was, at the very least, a show worth watching. Here's why.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nWhy do I rate it so? Most anime shows - at least for me - have some sort of glimmer of light that seems to catch my eye. (Of course this is for me personally, so don't be snapping on my words). There is something interesting that pulls me in that makes me want to watch the show. For me, originally, it was the story. Of course, that was just a preconceived notion I had; the story was interesting. Now, after finishing Kyoukai no Kanata, am I disappointed? Not really...though it is personal preference. There were parts I didn't like. There were parts I thought were well done. Was it perfect? No. It was still interesting to me though. There were issues with plot execution that made me a little sad, but that didn't make the overall show horrible. In my experience, there are shows far worse. Many many shows. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nWell, KyoAni never fails to pull off at least semi decent art. Kyoukai no Kanata is no exception. To me, the art was colorful and fit well with the story. I won't go too far into it, but honestly, it looked good. Well, being KyoAni, the art was magnificent. The scenery was beautiful and the visuals blew me away.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThis rating is probably a little high for some of you. But I really enjoyed the OST. It isn't the best, that's for sure, but it was beautiful enough for each scene the show had. And I really enjoyed the opening and ending. Of course, because the story itself was a little sketchy in its execution, the OST lost a little \"oomph\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nOkay, this part is entirely subjective. Everyone has his or her own opinion. But I thought that with the episode restraint, the characters all had at least a little development with some exceptions. I found it a little strange that all the main characters had such distinction from everyone else, but then again, it could have been worse.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, each character was unique. They had strange quirks and it made the show fun to watch. Despite the show itself being somewhat dark, I was able to get a few laughs from the character interaction. I know that opinion is subjective in its own, but honestly, we all have our own opinions. To me, the character interaction was fun and made my Wednesday's more enjoyable. Watching the characters bicker was by no means unpleasant to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThe show wasn't a complete failure. In fact, I could only say that Kyoukai no Kanata was like the majority of the shows out there. Great in some ways, and rather not so great in others. But the show, in its entirety, was better than a lot of others things I watched. It probably wouldn't be anywhere near the best, but it was enjoyable to say the least. I had my laughs. I had my teary-eyed moments. I grew angry. I was sad. Though the show failed to pull me completely in one direction, I was able to get a wide array of emotions, and it was beautiful to me. The show was beautiful in so many ways. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nAll I can truly say is this: don't judge this show without finishing it. Feel free to disregard what I think of the show. In the end, everyone's review reflects his or her opinion. Even the most professionally written review here on MAL has some subjectivity. I don't condone that. But no one can judge how you like a show but YOU. And if you arrive to a conclusion based on what little you see, because you watched a few episodes, you may or may not be robbing yourself of a good experience. So many times, shows I find to be a good experience to watch happen to have controversial ratings. That doesn't mean the person reading this will find this show to be something they like to watch. Reading my review over again, I can say that it is a measly attempt at an objective review. So...\\n\\n\r\nHere's what I'll say: don't reach a conclusion based on reviews or ratings. At least give the show a chance. Perhaps looking beyond such things you will find a show worth watching. Perhaps not. Only you can judge if this show is truly as [un]pleasant as others say it to be. \\n\\n\r\nI wish you all the best in your pursuit of anime.",

            "content": "\"No amount of great animation will save a bad story.\"-John Lasseter\r\n   When news came out that Kyoto Animation was going to make a supernatural anime me like many others were surprised and excited. A supernatural show with great animation made by one of the most popular anime studios in japan? What could possibly go wrong with Kyoukai No Kanata? Almost everything,apparently.\r\n   The story is set in a fictional world where Supernatural creatures called Youmu exist. Youmu come in various shapes and sizes. Although most Youmu are harmless. Some could be hostile and dangerous. To stop these Youmu from harminghumans there exists spirit world warriors, warriors with special powers who kill dangerous Youmu and keep balance to the world. The story revolves around Half youmu, Akihiro Kanbaru who saves a girl named Kuriyama Mirai, a spirit world warrior with the power to control her blood.\\n\\n\r\n   Sounds promising right? What went wrong? The first problem with Kyoukai No Kanata is its lack of direction. Kyoukai No Kanata is supposed to be a dark fantasy. But as the show progresses to the middle the show feels like more like a slice of life with a bit of comedy than a dark anime. The biggest offense is the idol episode. An episode that is pretty much a fan pandering episode in an attempt to boost sales. That may have boosted sales. But after that episode I really couldn't take this anime seriously anymore.\\n\\n\r\n   Apart from that there are also other problems with the story. But alot of times there is alot of unneccesary humor. I mean, a few laughs here and there are fine but too much just kills the atmosphere of the show. And it would have helped if the comedy was actually funny. But most of the comedy came up at the wrong time and felt forced. \\n\\n\r\n   The characters aren't much better either. There are 4 main characters of the show. Kanbaru Akihito, Kuriyama Mirai, Nase Mitsuki, and Nase Hiroomi. Kyoto Animations signature character designs look great. Mirai looks as cute as ever with her glasses and the others looked quite nice too. But looking deeper into them. They all feel one sided. Aside from her moe character design and clumsy personality there really isn't much to her. She doesn't do anything to stand out and I really couldn't relate to her at all. Akihito isn't good either. His glasses obsession is really annoying and pretty much the only thing that makes him different from other characters. The chemistry between them is also pretty lacking and one can only wonder if Akihito actually likes Mirai for her or for her glasses. The Nase siblings aren't remotely interesting either. So excuse me for not writing about them because there really isn't much to write about.\\n\\n\r\n   On a brighter note the Animation is quite detailed which is quite expected from Kyoto Animation. The backgrounds are all done beautifully. Character designs all looked great. The action scenes were also done nicely. But one small thing that I noticed is that Kyoto Animation is still slightly inexperienced in battle scenes. Although most of the movements were fluid some of the camera angles felt a bit awkward. This doesn't detract too much from the whole experience but I can't help think that with that amount of budget the battle scenes could have looked better. \\n\\n\r\n   The sound is also very good. Minori Chihara brings off an outstanding opening \"Kyoukai No Kanata\". An opening that fit with the show quite well. The ending song \"Daisy\" is also a very nice song done by Stereo Dive Foundation. The soundtrack also fit the show well. Everything from the action scenes to the comedy scenes were all fit with nice pieces. If only the story was as good as the sound...\\n\\n\r\n   Kyoukai No Kanata was a major disappointment for me. Not because of how bad it was. But because of what it could have been. Kyoukai No Kanata had alot of potential. But bad execution and bland characters stopped it from becoming something truly special.\\n\\n",

            "content": "For quite the long time, people have exposed their wishes for Kyoani, notable for their several slice of life series with high quality animation, to do something else other than the slow moe-filled series they're famous for. After years of exploring safe territory, they finally announced the highly antecipated supernatural series Kyoukai no Kanata. And with that, set themselves up for what is probably their biggest failure in the last few years.\r\nWhether they failed because the transition from slice of life to dark fantasy was too abrupt for them to handle or because they simply do not care for quality anymore, we can't be sure.We can just say for sure that Kyoukai no Kanata went wrong in every single aspect you can imagine, for simultaneously doing too much and nothing at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise is simple and somewhat clich\u00e9: half-human, half-youmu high school boy meets fighter girl who manipulates blood and kills youmu for a living. From this encounter, various events unfold. And that's just how it goes. The plot is all over the place; it constantly jumps around between episodes with moe and plain fanservice at its finest to plot-relevant episodes that actually accomplish nothing at all. It goes from fighting to unappealing drama to unfitting comedy to dancing idols. Yes, you heard me right: dancing idols. You should get a feel about how hard they are trying from that.\\n\\n\r\nIt's like the show can't decide whether it's light-hearted or dramatic. The \"dark fantasy\" label loses all of its meaning when over half of the screentime is spent on flat jokes and the protagonist dressed in costumes for fanservice purposes. The flow of the plot is ragged and it feels like a lot of scenes are incomplete or were cut out from how things are thrown in out of nowhere. Even when things do start to get half-decent, it means nothing when all of the scenes and episodes before that were messy and unfocused. They just feel like lucky pieces of candy in a colorful box full of rocks.\\n\\n\r\nAs if that's not enough, there is also an incredibly high number of asspulls happening for the sake of melodrama (the final scene alone is one of the single most gigantic asspulls I've ever seen in any piece of fiction), and roughly one or two out of all the plot-related points are explained. The whole story is weak, sloppy and unsatisfying from beginning to ending.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the cast of characters is very fitting to such plot. There's more of them than the show can handle, and they all feel ultimately forced. Our female lead, Mirai, is a typical bland airhead ditzy moe uguu anime girl who's more defined by her overused catchphrase than by her personality traits. Our protagonist, Akihito, seems to be defined as a whole by his fetish for glasses and nothing more. The main cast closes with the Nase siblings Mitsuki and Hiromi, who are an obvious pretext for shoving incest jokes where they don't belong, but are surprisingly the best characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nLike the plot, they are more like sketches that jump around inside their respective stereotypes than actual finished, fully-written characters. They have every kind of adornment you can ask for - catchphrases, defining quirks, canon hobbies, superpowers, fetishes and whatnot - but lack what matters the most: depth that allows them to break free from their respective archetypes. They abuse of Mirai's \"how unpleasant\" catchprase, Akihito's fetish for glasses and Hiromi's siscon so much that watching them becomes absolutely cringe-worthy at some point. They're so empty that sometimes the dialogue about their motivations needs to be filled with these things when the pseudo-depth inserted by unecessary drama won't cut it. The only one out of the main four who actually feels like a character and not a scribble on the last page of a notebook is Mitsuki, but she alone isn't enough to save the character interactions from being a feast of awkward catchphrase exchanges.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast isn't much better than the main cast. Some of them instigate conflict for reasons that are never explained, some of them just exist without ever doing anything relevant or even being fun to watch (I'm looking at you, Ai Shindou), some of them are likeable but butchered by terrible writing. The main antagonist is bland and unreasonable. Some of the characters literally just fade away in the very last episode with little to no explanation given. Most of them never go through character development of any sort, and reach the ending of the series without having gone through any changes at all. They are a group of characters with a sparkle of potential that was thrown inside of the water, making them useless - there's really no other way to put it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is decent; it is Kyoani after all. The action scenes looked pretty fluid and the characters had good expressions and movements. Not their best, but definitely not bad. The character designs, although not ugly, are really boring and generic. Not much to say about the sound. The voice acting was fine, so was the music, and the only thing that stood out were the OP and ED themes. The art and sound were overall fair and not really bad.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, is Kyoukai no Kanata enjoyable? In some sort of twisted way, it is. As much as you can't help it but noticing how ridiculous and poorly done the whole thing is, it's most likely that it won't bore you. You may get increasingly frustrated with the amount of wasted potential and lazy writting, but you won't get bored. Kyoani's biggest disappointment might be a good thing to go with if you just want something silly to kill time.\\n\\n\r\nFinal scores, tl;dr\\n\r\nStory: 2/10 - Jumps around, plot is all over the place, tries to focus on so many things that succeeds in nothing.\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 6/10 - Not too impressive, but overall pretty decent.\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10 - Empty, defined by their quirks and catchphrases, lacking depth and development completely\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10",

            "content": "Despite the various bad comments and reviews panning this series, I took a leap of faith and decided to watch it. I must say that, although not the best anime of all time, it is an enjoyable anime series.\r\nWith a length of 12 episodes, Kyoto Animation's \"Kyoukai no Kanata (Beyond the Boundary)\" brings us a tale of two young teenagers, whose hearts are filled with regrets and burdens placed on their shoulders. Their actions will determine the fate of humanity itself, and while at that, they will draw near each other as they learn more about themselves and come to terms with their hardships. Itis an excellent story about two ill-fated youngsters with a fresh sci-fi twist. \\n\\n\r\nNext, I will give you certain characteristics of the series that I find necessary to tell to those who are considering watching this series, as well as the premise. (TL;DR/Conclusions at the end.)\\n\\n\r\nStory and characters:\\n\r\nThe world is protected by Spirit Warriors, which have multiple powers to keep demon-esque creatures, called the \"yomu\" in line from attacking humanity. Then there's this certain Spirit Warrior girl with the name of Mirai Kuriyama. She is a Spirit Warrior, whose bloodline is considered cursed, that allows her to manipulate her blood as a weapon, such as a shield or a blade.  This feature is considered cursed, and as a consequence, she is constantly isolated by the rest of the Spirit Warrior community. Akihito Kanbara is a hybrid of half-yomu and half-human. This uncommon mixture grants him the power to be immortal, although he is not a Spirit Warrior. He, just like Mirai, is another outcast of society because of the strange anomaly that he is. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is all about the burdens that these two characters, Akihito Kanbara and Mirai Kuriyama, have to carry; and the relationship between these two, that begins to grow and flourish as the series progresses. We are thrown into this compelling and exciting world with close to no information about what's going on, and much of it comes through dialog between the characters. This is all about showing, not telling. The bad side of this is that you can get easily lost if you don't pay enough attention, but the good one is that time is not wasted by explaining. \\n\\n\r\nThe narrative starts slow paced, with a focus on introducing the characters and their qualities, fetishes and catchphrases:  It is more like a slice of life anime, with each episode having a yomu and being fought by the main characters, and in-between, we see how the characters interact as if they are living a completely normal life; but as the series progresses, the plot starts to gain momentum and delivers a well balanced dose of comedy, action, drama and a shot of romance, as these two outcasts begin to draw together. Near the end, the loose ends are being tied up and the hidden motivations explained, as well as the tension begins to rise exponentially.  I have to say that by the end of the series, my hands were clinched as the narration becomes way faster and entertaining than in the beginning (I actually considered dropping it by the third episode). Some episodes focus more on side stories, rather than the actual storyline. Although they are enjoyable and entertaining, they do kill some momentum from the previous episodes. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the series is itself more a drama series than a comedy series, there are a lot of laughs that can be found between the difficult events that lead to the climax. All the characters are excellently designed, all having a certain aspect of their personality that makes their interactions with one another really funny and enjoyable overall, being the episode 6 the pinnacle of the comedy in this series.\\n\\n\r\nA big flaw I find in the series is that one of the enemy's goal or motive is never stated. It gave you a vague explanation of what he was doing, but didn't give a clear motive. Although at last he is not the main enemy, I would have liked some closure on him. (I won't say the name of the character, to avoid spoilers.) In a similar fashion, some of the supporting cast is largely ignored for big part of the series. Even though these slips, I consider the story and characters well designed.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound:\\n\r\nThe art was astounding and is really one of the strongest areas of the series, if not the strongest. It is one of the greatest series that I've seen when it comes to animation. This series makes you want to take a screenshot of every scene and make it your newest wallpaper for your cellphone: The shots are so beautifully colored and detailed and the sequences are so fluid and eye catching that it stuns you every time an action scene comes up and the special effects come to effect. Nothing less than expected from a work by Kyoto Animation. I really think that this was the factor that made me continue the series, despite my consideration of dropping it. The music is also remarkable. Although it is not the greatest soundtrack I've heard, the OST blends well into the environment and the scenes. The opening and ending find I really fitting to the story and premise; as well as the insert song in episode 6.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and final thoughts (TL;DR):\\n\r\nAt first, I wasn't really enjoying the series. It was really hard for me to give full attention and avoid being distracted while watching the very first episodes. But as the series progressed, the more momentum it gained and by episode 6, I couldn't get my eyes off it. (It specially is episode 6 a really hysterical one. It had been long since I had genuinely laughed with an anime series.) Despite many critics panning this series, I really liked it.  I can say that this is not the best anime I\u2019ve seen, but I don\u2019t regret the time I spent watching it. But well, this is just, like, my opinion, man.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Kyoukai no Kanata is an amazing series. It\u2019s got well designed characters, a captivating and credible love story, attention-catching premise, beautiful scenery worth a wallpaper, and fluid sequences. Although I believe the series starts slow and sloppy, if you like sci-fi, beautiful art and/or romance and drama, I highly recommend you this series, and please, don't reach any conclusion based on reviews, since everybody can have different opinions. \\n",

            "content": "\"Fools have a habit of believing that everything written by a famous author is admirable. For my part I read only to please myself and like only what suits my taste.\" ~Voltaire~\r\nKyoukai no Kanata was by no means a very ambitious project (or a very pretentious subject). It had very linear and straight forward story line which actually very easy to understand and very comfy to follow, delivered with excellent animation and a proper adolescence romance development ... is probably an understatement. But, saying it was the best foreshadowing is also an exaggeration.\r\nFor starters, the anime was built upon a very basic concept: human withsupernatural power, hunting monster. Well, I can get the hunch of where all this 'generic' spouting comes from. But the foundation itself was built upon several layers, in which each layer redefine the rough concept and premise into its own unique traits. So, on the surface, it does looks like any supernatural anime which comes from before 2005. But, if we take a closer look, the show didn't follow the usual formula for a show which tagged: \"teen, supernatural, fantasy, anime\" in which I'll call it 'chuuni anime' for shorts. So, that was also explain very polar opposite receptions by fans.\\n\\n\r\nThe main idea behind the story is about seeking a new light at the other side of tunnel/boundary. Which is basically, what Mirai was trying to do. But of course its ot so easy as to flip the other side of a coin. There are also Akihito who has the same (more or less) state as Mirai. Yes, the story revolves between these two characters, starting from where their first encounter, their conflict, acceptance and longingness. This is one of very few shows which shows a proper teenage romantic development mostly due because they have a rather similar condition which makes them able relate to each other. That was the basic story concept.\\n\\n\r\nThe world was built upon nowadays era and civilization but with a little tweak, that there are monsters which lurking in the darkness, waiting to infect humans with its poisonous nature... or killed them, whatever bad effects they brought. All of this 'youmu' concept-building is shallow, weak, generic and so does the 'ikaishi' part. There are almost not enough explicit exposition in exploring both concepts, because its not your usual 'nerdy' chuuni shows which spouting something like 5 new vocabularies every 3 new episodes or so. The mixture of slice of life and supernatural in a sense is very pleasant, but in another sense was frightfully almost doesn't mix. The reason is maybe has something to do with this studio specialty, which is Slice of Life (SoL), and cute girls. The SoL part has more depth even when compared to any other SoL anime (let alone another chuuni anime). Their technique in mastering this particular aspect was just so excellently done. You could feel the atmosphere surrounding this show. Heck it does feels like watching someone bringing a mini-DV into 2D world. But this depth of exploring SoL side was a bit backfired. Every supernatural elements looks out of place. The youmu form for example, just looks like derived from a pok*mon game or something.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline was very linear as I said earlier, but it doesn't follow the regular formula which says \"beginning, middle, end\". Rather, it straight forward jump into a start-middle scene which left some people confused and screaming \"plot hole\" out loud. Well, this is to be expected, since that was how it was... in the beginning. I even have this tingling funny sensation when watching first 3 episodes. Why did they leave plot hole so open, and heck even pointed it out. Then, I understand it was a foreshadowing... which was revealed after episode 8. Here's the problem: This show tried to bring forth a whole huge concept story on to the table, which is actually very rare thing to see since all we've got were per-arc episode(s) which doesn't entangled to each other. So, we're used to a scheme where: 1st episode doing foreshadowing, then following episode (or two) does the revelation... which you can see in every single chuuni anime... ever..., also don't forget the explicit spoonfeeding. This show does none of those thing. which is why for some people, watching this show was kinda tiring. It could be understandable since this show requires huge amount of observation span and very long patience... which not many people have. As a proof, a lot of people doesn't recognize 'Sakura Inami' in her first confrontation with Mirai despite all the clues being littered throughout the show. (sorry, no further spoiler).\\n\\n\r\nThe execution is a bit flocky sometimes, but in general still pretty decent. But of course you still need to be observant and use a bit of deduction thinking in figuring how the world moves. Since there are barely any explicit long-ass chuuni dialogue in this show (I didn't say none). In directional stand-point is still also very flocky. There are some good-standout episode (like Takemoto ones), but there are also very bad ones. The reason why the difference in directional execution was so glaring might because there are almost no clean-up from the general director. The reson is..., well I don't know.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation..., is the core of this show. I could talk for hours regarding this topic, but lets just make it simple. The production quality of this product is simply..., outstanding. Kyoukai no Kanata looks like a saint compared to any other action anime. Well, you could say I was exaggerating, but as far as TV anime are concerned, there are very few other action anime which have this kind of production quality, not even SnK (sorry titan fans). There are no reused scene (except that single one from ep 6), no still images (except it was used in succession to create a sense of complex movement (e.g. ep 2, when Mirai slashed zombie youmu form the sand), it has sense of impact and sense of weight (like several scene in EoE), It doesn't have black screen followed by flashing effect, It doesn't have badly produced CG sequence(s), it has terrific inbetweening, but it does however has some share of bad cuts. For example in ep 2 where Mirai swinging her blood without sense of direction and ep 3..., you know that infamous 'timber'. Also, I don't know why, it has several 'copycat' key frames (not reused, but done in similar style). You might felt that the action scenes were a bit short compared to any other action shows. That was because 3 minutes action in this anime = 8 ~ 15 minutes in any other anime. Action flow were so packed and almost gives no room for chanting or engaging in conversation. Even if it does, it still managed to perfectly fit into the timing between action cuts. It doesn't sacrifice the loss of quality for sake of having flowing animation, which is actually a big plus into the animation department. And, lastly of course the shiny Kigami episode. (inb4 idol dancing episode)\\n\\n\r\nThe lightning and several effects were movie-tier. And small quirk and gestures from characters were delicious seasoning in this already well-produced show. The music (BGM) were a bit hit & miss, but in general was good, the sound directions were flawless. There are several effect of sound where people talk outside the door is different from inside the door. It also have distinct variation, where people talk up-close or faraway, left or right direction. The voice act for each characters were also very good. Several hiccups sure, but it does gets better once you used to. Some people might not overcome them, but of course different people = different taste buds. The opening and ending song were also very catchy. More over this is also one of very few anime which are using Op/ED sequence in layering one of episode, which is actually very neat works.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the ending..., THE ENDING, never forget the ending. By no means a satisfactory ending since it leaves so many questions and makes people a bit impatient. But as far as the main story concept was concerned, it was a...., well to be honest I'm not too satisfied with the ending too. Or maybe it was intentionally letting the viewer to interpret the ending as their imagination or their deduction just like Hyo*ka was.\\n\\n\r\nKyoukai no Kanata stands at the basis of simplicity and displayed as it is without sounding so deep or pretentious or dramatic. But because it started at that very simple idea, because of great directing, multilayer subtlety, and very long foreshadowing, it entices the viewer to at least pay attention to a bit of exposition without feeding needless explicit argument for the sake of understanding. At the end of the day, if you're someone who don't satisfied with action sequence in anime, if you don't want to exhaust yourself in complicated chuuni dialogue, if you're tired watching too many harem anime, or were just seeking for a nice, comfy action anime to spend on weekend or when you're tired from work/school. Kyoukai no Kanata does just that. I might advise to marathon it, at least it will eliminates the patience/impatience factor. But the observation will still there.",

            "content": "Pretty damn interesting show. Along the way I had some pretty mixed reactions, and feelings, however those negative feelings didn't stop me from enjoying Kyoukai no Kanata.\r\nStory- 8/10 \r\nYou can pretty much get a concept or idea of what the show is about by reading the description lol. That aside, the story was actually pretty decent.  Full of thrills, excitement, and feels. There were many events that I loved in the story, however my most favorite on-going thing about it was every episode (Including the stupid ones, yeah I'm talking about episode 6) had the right amount of enjoyment whether it was action orcomedy a majority of the events that had played out work out pretty well in my book.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's Kyoto animation or \"KyoAni\" .... of course they make characters, even characters you don't care about a bit more visually appealing or cute. That aside, the action scenes were visually spectacular!!! Even the scenes that had the feels to them were pretty great to look at.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I think the only thing I liked about the sound department was the ending song. I suppose I \"tuned\" out quite a bit when it came to BGM.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNot the best cast of characters, however after some time, I actually started to warm up to them. I have seen many shows where the perverted MC has some odd fetish, and this was or I think this was the first title I've seen where male MC has a glasses fetish.... so there's that. Moving on, Mirai, I wanted to hate her because unless they are loli's or magical girls that whole \"cutesy\" \"Shy\" \"Nervous\" archetype.. erhm.. character doesn't sit right with me. Especially in genre's that are action/fantasy. Now, there are handfuls of characters that I'm okay with that are \"as I listed above\" however, I just couldn't find myself at ease with Mirai.... UNTIL.. the middle of the series or the \"rising action.\" After seeing her act so selflessly, it really changed my opinions about her and made her a lot tolerable.. The others I honestly couldn't care too much about.... No, seriously.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, I thought Kyoukai no Kanata was pretty good.  It had its' good moments and bad however, in the end, it was still lots of fun re-watching. \\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts, I would recommend if you love shows with lots of action, developing romance and emotional moments. I had to give this show a 8/10 because it really was an unexpectedly good title from KyoAni",

            "content": "Kyoukai no Kanata is the newest anime from Kyoto Animation who is best known for their multitude of anime all about high school clubs and moe character designs. Kyoukai no Kanata is their first real attempt at a darker action series, despite having all of the previously mentioned aspects in addition to that. So how did this new genre attempt work? Given that it's in KyoAni's name you would expect this, Kyoukai no Kanata has beautiful animation which holds up both during action-packed scenes and the laid back ones. However, while the soundtrack is also good, the story suffers from having a poorly explained plotand setup as well as an average character cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins when our glasses-loving protagonist, Akihito, sees a girl on the roof of his school. He proceeds to make some monologue about suicide that seems like foreshadowing at the time but never really applies to anything later on as he calls out to the girl on the roof. The girl, whose name is Mirai, stabs him but fails to kill him as it turns out that Aikihito is immortal. Mirai is a novice \"Spirit World Warrior,\" people who fight creatures called \"youmu\" that are invisible to normal humans. Mirai had heard that Akihito was an immortal half-youmu and decided to get some practice by using him as a \"stabbing-bag\" which Akihito obviously did not appreciate. The story continues on as Akihito and Mirai grow closer together, discover secrets about each other, and get caught up in the plans of both other people and youmu.\\n\\n\r\nThe story suffers from a few things. It poorly introduces the world of youmu and Spirit World Warriors by skipping over some important details and saving them for later. Despite an entertaining filler episode, it comes at a bad time and interrupts a side story which interrupts the main story which leads to some confusion for the viewer. It also has a bit of a cop-out ending with things being a little rushed at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't all bad, but the good parts are mostly due to the relatively good main characters. The four main characters consist of Mirai, Akihito, and the siblings Mitsuki and Hiromi. Where the main characters hit their strongest points is in the sarcastic comedy between them. From Mirai's catchphrase \"you're unpleasant\" to Akihito and Hiromi's fetishes for glasses and younger sisters respectively to Mitsuki's disgusted sarcasm towards both guys, the characters never let the serious attitude of the story prevent them from being the normal sarcastic assholes that teenagers really are (or at least my group of friends is minus the fetishes). While their quirks may be a little overdone at times, they never become a hindrance to the story (well, not more than it was already doing on it's on). The minor characters are where some more noticeable issues arise. None of them get enough screen time to develop aside from maybe Ai-chan, and many of them are easily forgettable and hardly relevant to the plot at all. The few who are important are easily forgettable or just annoying like in the case of the obvious villain. Aside from Ai, the minor characters are basically all of the adults in the show and most of their designs are similar to the point where a few of them can be mixed up (this is one of the very few problems with the animation).\\n\\n\r\nBut onto the best part of this show. The fluid fight scenes, interesting character designs of the main characters (as long as you don't mind moe), and the beautiful scenery despite most of the show taking place in an average-looking Japanese town are what make the animation of this show top-notch. Even as far as KyoAni shows go, this one still stands out in this category (mainly due to it being one of the few with action sequences). One of the only issues is something which many anime have problems with: character designs become much less detailed when the characters are \"farther away\" from the camera. The soundtrack during the action scenes also adds to the intensity and makes them even more impressive. It also adds to the comedic/sarcastic moments and makes them even more of a pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 4/10\\n\r\nAnimation - 9/10\\n\r\nSoundtrack - 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters - 5/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\r\nOverall - 6.6/10\\n\\n\r\nKyoukai no Kanata is an enjoyable show with excellent animation, a good soundtrack, but unfortunately suffers from weak minor characters and an inconsistent plot with some pointless side features that distract from the real story. It all culminates in a visually impressive ending but makes little sense story-wise. I hope KyoAni (which is one of my favorite anime studios) continues to make visually amazing action series, but it would help if they improved the story of their next one.",

            "content": "Kyoukai no Kanata aka 'Beyond the Boundary' seems to be quite a controversial anime in a sense that  some people seem to love it i think, while others say its a let down. I think its brilliant and i loved it till the end. True it could be better. But every anime has areas it needs to improve in. The fall i would say about Kyoukai no Kanata is its potential. It has masses of it. I already think its amazing, but i think it has the potential to be even greater. There was simply not enough time allowed to truly explore and understandthe world and characters and to draw out its real potential. Like the past of Akihito and Mirai and there trauma's for example. Its something that should've been explored a bit more I feel. Also, I would've liked to know the other characters a bit better as well.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise I would say Kyoukai no Kanata is a breath of fresh air. Its original. Its unique and I adored it. The sad, darker undertone was covered brilliantly with hilarious quips and quirks that were admittedly a bit odd and awkward at times but hilarious none the less. I have no complaints about the art. The story line is undeniably linear and even somewhat predictable in some cases, but I don't think it takes away from the anime at all.\\n\r\nI fell there is a considerable amount of depth to Akihito and Mirai especially albeit there could be a tiny bit more for the other main characters.    The music compliments the moods and genre well and I adore the characters. Albeit I would like to get know the other characters a little better.\\n\\n\r\nIf i sound like Im singing Kyoukai no Kanata's praises as if the best anime in the world then let me make it clear that its because I wouldn't want others to overlook because of the various bad reviews it has. Since joining here I've found that people on this website can be exceedingly harsh in there judgment. There are other animes that far surpass Kyoukai No Kanata. But it is a diamond in the rough which i feel saddly has been undermined and I invite you to watch it and judge it for yourself\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend it\\n",

            "content": "Following their high success with \"Free! Iwatobi Swim Club\" Kyoto Animation has done it again with the stellar fall anime \"Kyoukai no Kanata\". Overall, the series works with supernatural elements, such as the \"spirit world warriors\" and the \"youmu\".\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story of Kyoukai no Kanata is about protagonists Kuriyama Mirai and Kanbara Akihito. Students in high school, both extraordinary in different ways. Mirai is the only living member of the 'cursed' spirit world warrior clan that is able to manipulate blood. Akihito is a half-youmu, half-human, making him immortal. The story revolves around these two and their adventures, and the even mysterious \"Kyoukai no Kanata\"or \"Beyond the Boundary\". Kyoto Animation deemed this anime as a \"slice of life\" but I think it is anything but. Setting aside the filler episode, episode 6, Kyoukai no Kanata very much has a plot that is driven forward through the whole series. The plot is never really slow, and is intriguing with each episode. Kyoukai no Kanata has many different subject matter and themes that get your brain thinking.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nKyoto Animation has always been known for their beautiful, flawless animation and character design. None of this is forgotten in Kyoukai no Kanata. The atmosphere is set beautifully, each character's movement fluid and realistic. Battle scenes are works of art. There is never a time during the series where I questioned the animator's abilities. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI am not one to pay attention much to soundtracks,. but I must say that the soundtrack work in Kyoukai no Kanata fit with the mood. The OST is well suited for the scenes they are played during, and add to the atmosphere of the scene. As well, the voice actors are always on par, and portray each character distinctly, with the correct feelings and dramatization.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nFor a 12 episode anime, I believe the main characters are developed fairly well. Mirai Kuriyama, first of all, portrays as a sweet heart in the beginning. She is a cutie with bubble gum pink hair and red rimmed glasses. Over the series, I was delighted to see depth put into her character, and she was ultimately likable. She is not the kind of protagonist that sits around and waits for things to happen. She does not rely on other people for help, and ultimately is strong on her own. Kanbara Akihito has his quirks. And it's interesting to see these little quirks in action. He has a thing for glasses, often calling Mirai a \"megane bishoujo\" (bespectacled beauty). As for the other characters, each had distinctions that make them different from each other. For a time frame of 12 episodes, each character gets a relative amount of screen time suitable to their role.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nTo be honest, Kyoukai no Kanata is definitely my favourite of the season. It has been a long time since I have found dual protagonists (Mirai and Akihito) so likable. The ever present plot, the senseless fluff, the jokes, the quirks, all of it tied together had me enjoying Kyoukai no Kanata all the way through. While it depends on the person as to if they enjoy it or not, I dare say Kyoukai no Kanata is worth it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nFor all these reasons, I believe Kyoto Animation hit the mark with Kyoukai no Kanata. With the series finished and wrapped up, I can only hope for a second season to answer all the questions I still have. Kyoukai no Kanata is overall a superb anime that deserves a chance.",

            "content": "Kyoukai no Kanata. The very name conjures cryptic mystery and fantastical wonder. The world is divided into humans, and youmu. Here's my personal review of this fast, strange experience.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe concept of humans and monsters struggling for control in the same world is not unseen. In fact, it's used extremely often. Kyoukai no Kanata is no stranger to this tradition. Touting a common concept and developing from it, Kyoukai takes us on a somewhat unique look towards a familiar yarn - losing some charm in the process.\r\nArt: 10/10\r\nKyoto Animation's animation and art are not to be trifled with. Known for masterful eye-candy such as Free!,Chuunibyou, K-ON and Haruhi, KyoAni has brought us another breathtaking piece of animated wizardry. The story may be overused, but watching this for the art is more than worth it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nAs with KyoAni's god par animation, sound is also extremely well done, captivating your ears for more than just twelve episodes. Not once, not twice, not thrice, but ten times have I attained eargasms. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nMirai is just adorable. There's no doubt about that. Akkey may be your average, sacrificial main character,  but he's nothing compared to Hiroomi and his adorable imouto.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nMost of the time I would watch this show for the animation. The animation, the animation, everything about it rocked my balls off. Once or twice, I got excited about the story, but this was a very enjoyable anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nNot your best monsters vs. humans anime, but the animation, sound, character and raw action take it away. Recommended to anyone who likes anything animated.",

            "content": "\u201c Don't walk behind me; I may not lead. Don't walk in front of me; I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend.\u201d\r\n                            -Albert Camus\r\nIf nothing else, Kyoukai no Kanata was an entertaining anime. It was able to produce tears, surprise, excitement, and many laughs. The coherency of the plot may have been questionable, but nonetheless, the ride that the anime portrayed was over-exceeded any nuances with the direction of the story line.\r\nThe mainissue that I had with KNK was the plot/story line. The first episode of Kyoukai provided substantial expectations about the nature of the plot. You have an immortal main character (Akihito Kanbara), and this mysterious arched four eyed cutie (Mirai Kuriyama) stabbing him in the stomach every chance she gets. You wonder why she is compulsively stabbing Akihito, and you start wonder whether she is some sort of physical sadist. \\n\\n\r\nThe mystery surrounding Mirai is enough to compel watching the next few episodes. Unfortunately, after the first three to four episodes, there is a sense that an integrant factor is missing from this anime. The location of this missing factor can not be exactly pin-pointed, but the direction of the anime did not seem to culminate to any substantive climax. It is like this anime prided in not taking itself seriously, and was being amused by our attempts to do so.  However, in an attempt to reel us back in, the story took an interesting twist by showing us the back story of Mirai. This was probably the highlight of the anime since the episode molded and answered the ambivalent aura of the semi-seriously constructed plot that was been shoved down our pharynx.\\n\\n\r\nThe last few episodes did not leave us with any certainty which is not a necessary requirement for excellence, but the ending did leave a significant amount of abstruse quandaries unanswered. If I assume that there will not be a second season, then this ending, in terms of plot development, was sub par.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of this anime was fantastic. The grandiose colours matched with uniquely drawn characters were enough to have me gaping at some of the scenes. For the most part, the animation was consistently fluid, and the action scenes were marvelously done. Every episode seemed sumptuous and fervent with sound and colour.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of sound, the background music was decent too. I do not believe that KnK has any stick-out-the-page musical piece, but the soundtrack wafted along with the majority of the scenes benignly. What did stand out to me was the ED of the anime, the way that the beginning of the ED innocently guided the final ending scenes of the episode into the first ED scene were done with potent aesthetics. I was amazed by the way Mirai was used in the ED as being alone, and extending her hand in front of her chest, aiming to have someone...anyone grab it back. You see people, supposed friends, just walk past her, giving her no mind. Finally, Akihito comes to her, and does not need to grab her hands, he just smiles at her. She smiles back. Amazingly done, I was not an initial fan of the ED, but it really grew on me after giving it a fair chance.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Kyoukai No Kanata had a tendency to be archetypal and paradigmatic. The variance of their comportment usually did not portray diversity. After a while, you get sick of the glasses fetish jokes given by the Akihito, the incestial jokes of  Hiroomi loses shock value after the second episode, Mitsuki's jokes are uninspired and non-rememberable, and Mirai's unpleasantries showed no bounds of reason. I understand that the anime is restricted to 12 episodes, but at least there should be an attempt to diversify these character's personality instead of the blatant banality of creativity. \\n\\n\r\nThis is not to say that I absolutely disliked the characters. I found Mirai to be rather cute, and charming (in her own way). Her shy but honest ( and I use the term honest loosely) attitude grew on me, and left me wanting to see more of her, minus her annoying \u201cThis is sooo unpleasant\u201d quote. I enjoyed her character design, it is not typical of an anime heroine, and she resembles the girl next door, or the girl sitting next to you in calculus class. \\n\\n\r\nI found Hiroomi to be a comical character, most of my laughs originated from this guy. I just found his nonchalant demeanor to be hilarious, and I laughed at his initial incestial jokes, before they became repetitive and boring. I wanted the story to delve deeper into his background, and there were hints on his past (intertwined with Akihito's past) being shown, but at the end left me wanting. \\n\\n\r\nMitsuki turned out to be the most lacking of the characters. She was the standard paradigmatic witty beautiful arrogant but caring girl. Nothing more, nothing less. Her jokes were useless, let alone funny. Her strength was not substantive, and there episodes at a time where she was MIA....I mean it's like we were expected to not care for this character at all. Mituski existed in this anime in just the capacity that she needed to exist for Hiroomi's jokes to be relevant. Her character design was also non-inspiring. \\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character in KNK is by far Akihito. Despite his turbulent and dark past, Akihito still manages to demonstrate an exuberant comportment, and a fervent fetish towards girl wearing glasses. Though his jokes were hardly funny, I found Akihito's optimism to be inspiring and touching. The moment where he tells Mirai, \u201c I'm just like you....a monster.\u201d was the most powerful moment for me in KNK. Though he suffered an abject past, he continued to make friends, laugh, and even fall in love. His maturity was refreshing for me to experience, and my only drawback is that I wished that he would have been more combat-inclined. There may not be any unique qualities about Akihito, his character type is rampant in modern anime, but that did not decrease my enjoyment of him.\\n\\n\r\n My enjoyment of KNK was in a state of fluctuation between the first half of the anime, but strong near the end. The ambiguity in whether the anime should be taken seriously or as a comedy left me ambivalent about my enjoyment until a decision was made to take the second half seriously. There was a \u201cfiller\u201d episode thrown in there that had me rolling in laughter, but after that episode, the plot became more dark and serious.  Ignoring the nuances of the plot, I would say that this anime was enjoyable and has the capacity to be rewatchable. Overall, I give the anime an 8/10,  and I would recommend KNK to anyone who is looking for a quick watch (that involves comedy, drama, and action) and isn't meticulous about plot details. \\n\\n\r\nRating:\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

            "content": "This is by far one of my favorite (if not my favorite) anime of all time. Why, you ask? Well i'm about to tell you. From the beginning of the story I fell in love, not only with the animation but with the music and the characters and all other aspects of this show. I just thought it was so wonderful, keep in mind that this is my first review ever though, so the quality of it will be who knows how bad or good- and i'm sure that many of you probably disagree and that's okay. Now onto the review:\r\nStory: (8/10) The fact thatnot much is explained until almost the last episode is cool. I see a lot of people complain about that, but the reality is that it's from Akihito's point of view and we get to know just about as much as he does. Al though this is true, some things could have gone further explained- youmu for example. Youmu come from people's jealousy, hatred, and malice, they also range from humanoids to insectoids- that's just about all i got, why do they possess humans? Why can some take on human forms? Why are some good (ex. Ayaka and Ai)? I also would have loved to have seen different encounters with humans that were possessed by youmu, and i feel as if a lot could have been explained about Izumi and the one guy who was trying to let the kyoukai no kanata destroy the world for some reason. Another flaw in the story would have to be going into depth about the character's pasts. In conclusion, they could have gone into more depth about the characters but instead they chose not to. While reading the light novel I found lots of things that seemed crucial to the story that were left out. Other than things not being explained thoroughly enough and the slow-ish pace, I thought the story was great. Although slow-paced, It was very captivating and humorous, the episodes could make me sob one minute and laugh the next. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (10/10) The sound definitely gets a 10/10, i'm the kind of person who will watch the opening and ending once throughout the entire series and then never watch it again. This wasn't the case for this show, I love both the opening and the ending sososo much and haven't skipped it once. Not sure if special effect sounds are included in this, but I saw no flaw in those either. The background music always fit the scene, and the character songs were marvelous. Everything in the musical aspect was great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (1000/10) Geez, this set of characters is by far my favorite ever. I am super picky with characters, honestly most of the time I really don't necessarily favor any of the characters in a show or anime that I watch. There were no two characters that were two much a like, they all stood out in their own little ways. Whether you're looking for a funny, over-dramatic, cute, pervert character or a masochistic, emotionless, yet very funny character you're going to find it and everything in between. Mirai and Akihito's relationship was honestly perfect to me. I hate stories that overly focus on the romance aspect and spend too much time dwelling on it, in this story you get to see them slowly fall for each other, which I find to be the cutest thing. I love love love the occasional cute moments and act of affection that have actual motives, which is what I found here. Since it doesn't explain the characters in much detail, you get to learn about them yourself. You get to see them grow confident in themselves, fight different battles, and interact with others. For a show with a measly 12 episodes I thought the character development and character's in general were pretty great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10) This is quite obvious. The mere fact that I am taking my time to write this review after sleeping for about an hour last night and continuing to not sleep just so I could watch the show, shows that the enjoyment level was high up in my eyes. I take lots and lots of time to finish an anime, especially if i'm not too interested in it. I definitely wouldn't have to look forward to watching it every week the minute it comes out (even if that means doing it in class) if the enjoyment level wasn't a 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this anime a 10, with the only weak point being the story (or how they portray the story in the anime, i should say) this anime deserves a 10. I hope this review is helpful for whatever reason and I hope there are others who can find as much joy in this show as I can. Thank you for reading.\\n",

            "content": "I never knew there was a fetish for girls who wears glasses until I watched this anime.  Now I realize I enjoy it when some girls wear their glasses?  Warning, you may become a megane freak from this anime.  Oh and you may get a Japanese lesson from this series as well... how unfortunate.  \r\nStory: 7\r\nIn what seems to be a normal world is actually inhabited by supernatural creatures (Different subs use different names for these supernatural creatures) and people with supernatural powers.  Our main character is half human and half creature as well as a person with a fetishfor glasses.  The story follows his journey to help Mirai, a girl from a cursed clan and has the ability to manipulate her own blood, fight these supernatural creatures.  \\n\\n\r\nThe ending felt very forced and unnatural.  The ending seemed to just be there to make the viewer of the show happy, but the way they did it felt so forced in.  \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing was fine, it felt a bit rushed towards the end.  They may have been able to remove some fillers as well and spaced it out a bit better... but the fillers were enjoyable as well.  \\n\\n\r\nI do wish they answered more questions instead of introducing more, as at the end of the series, there were so many things I wanted to ask but I knew that these questions were purposely left there to let the viewers think.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nKyoto Animation is known for their great animation and scenery.  There work on Kyoukai no Kanata is no exception.  Many times throughout the series was I in wonder and awe because of how amazing the animation was.  Every movement of the characters were smooth.  \\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes in the anime are better than most.  Most action themed anime series lose details in the background and animation of the fight scene are never as smooth as scenes outside an action scene.  Kyoto Animation did an excellent job with their action scenes, as they used transitions during the right times, as well as keeping the background as detailed as it was during normal scenes.  They even did rapid still frames during the action scenes and it still looked smooth.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I had were some character designs, aside from Mirai, Hi'romi and Akhito, the designs for the characters weren't too amazing.  Mitsuki and Aoi look like normal background characters and weren't given a design that allowed them to stand out, such as glasses, a scarf or a vest.  This is just a small problem though, as the characters are still memorable outside of their design.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nKyoukai no Kanata by Minori Chihara, the self-named OP for the series is a great way to start every episode.  Starts off very calm but leads to an exciting verse and chorus, it is very similar to how the series progresses.  The series starts off warm and calm, but escalates in action.  My favorite thing about this entire series, is the ED, Daisy by STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION.  Nothing sounds as good as the actual series transitions into the ED through the sound.  Typically used toward the last episodes of most series, Kyoukai no Kanata uses this transition into the ED frequently and is very enjoyable.  The song itself is a very good song.\\n\\n\r\nIf you aren't aware, since the internet blew up when the episode aired... Kyoukai no Kanata has a filler episode that has an idol theme to it.  The insert song used for that episode, Yakusoku no Kizun, is pretty much an idol song... but is still enjoyable.  \\n\\n\r\nThe background music was great as well, matched the mood, no problems.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThe characters were very good.  They all are memorable as the story gives enough depths and back story to each character to make them memorable... except one.  The one character I wished we had more background information and possible history was the antagonist... Fujima.  (I had to look up his name since he wasn't that memorable at all..)  He is a character that is shown to be a normal villain, but with no depth making him easy to forget.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only three characters that developed were Akhito, Mirai and Mitsuki.  I would say the only two that needed development were Akhito and Mirai as Mitsuki opening up to her brother is a minor development.  Akhito and Mirai's character development was quite a ride and very enjoyable as they developed around each other, much like a romance.  Watching this development was a highlight for this series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nMuch as everyone has said about this anime, the series has a strong start but gets a bit rough at the ending.  I argue that it gets rough around the last two episodes, others argue it gets rough earlier.  I did have a higher expectation for this series, but it only fell a little short story-wise, but the sound and art made up for the rough ending.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nWhat would be nice would be a special for what happened after the ending or a movie and knowing Kyoto Animation, one of these is going to happen.  A chance for a sequel?  The way the series ended, and with the questions left, there could be a sequel... but the ending has enough closure to completely end the series where it is.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "It surprises me to see the mixed reaction to Kyoukai no Kanata. Some love it, even considering it as their favourite anime ever, yet some dropped it quick and didn't like it at all. I'm neither of these. I don't hate it, yet don't considering it a masterpiece. I just really liked it. Here's why.\r\nNow, as a story, Kyoukai no Kanata goes completely unanswered until the last episode. You are quite frankly left wondering many things, and a lot of \"whys\" float in your head. However this isn't the worst thing that could possibly happen. It's supposed to be a dark fantasy anime. Perhaps it'sright that there is a lot of mystery involved. That's good. For most it keeps you watching. Yet for some that might not be the case. In terms of a story, if you don't like getting confused or waiting for the resolution (basically the last episode), don't watch Kyoukai no Kanata. The stories darkness and mystery is a fundamental aspect of everything you watch, so I believe if you have patience, you'll love it.\\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation did a great job on Kyoukai no Kanata. Simple as that. They captured the essence of story, the emotions, the feelings of the characters with the animation. The Youmu in particular as well as the fight scenes are great to watch. I say good job Kyoto animation. Characters voices are very much suitable to the sorts of characters, and is very much helpful in allowing you to feel the way they do. The music for me wasn't the most amazing thing to my ears, but it certainly wasn't bad at all.\\n\\n\r\nNow, for the characters as they are, can be considered good. There is a lot of focus on the identity of each character, and their specific traits. However that's about as far as it goes. I can share my criticism with others in that there is little depth to the characters. Don't get me wrong the characters are brilliant and suit Kyoukai no Kanata to a T. I feel that sometimes the misplaced comedy and sexual gags get in the way of some potentially great dialogue or charade development. It certainly doesn't drag anything down, it's more of a personal suggestion that there be more stories behind the characters. But you can only do so much in 12 episodes so I do understand why it was made how it was.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, I can really say I enjoyed it. I would have rated Kyoukai no Kanata an 8 an hour ago. However on watching the final episode it did step up the mark to a 9. Some might disagree with me on this rating, seeing as most feel the lack of a fluidic story and decently developed characters ruin it. However I do see Kyoukai no Kanatas purpose. As a fantasy darkness anime, you cannot be certain on anything. Just about anything could have been done for the final episode, and the way it was ended was great. I believe you should watch it. Test your patience, and then watch the final episode. Then you'll understand why Kyoukai no Kanata actually goes beyond the boundary (Haha) in its genre. \\n\\n\r\n9/10.\\n",

            "content": "Although I am sure that many people will disagree with my review here it is. After having watched all episodes of Kyoukai no Kanata I can safely state that this anime has gone on my top 10 worst anime. \r\nAllow me to explain why. Even though it showed a promising start it quickly revealed its true nature. At the best moment I could claim it to be mediocre. The only thing that was always exceptional was the art. Other than that the story was lacking if not outright non-existent. The term plot-hole does not begin to describe this anime. A more appropriate term would havebeen a black hole since you have no idea why anything happens.\\n\\n\r\nThe ost was mediocre. Nothing really bad but also nothing that would get you excited as well. Its one of those osts you forget the minute you hear it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters were filled with potential but no real effort was made to properly introduce them to the viewers. Yes I know that it only had 12 episodes but even so the character development was exceptionally bad. As the story progressed I started disliking certain characters I found quite interesting in the first episode simply because their actions and decisions made no sense at all.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary the plot was bad, the character development was bad, the ost was mediocre and the art was good. Overall, for me at least, this combination makes a very bad anime that not only I would not suggest to anyone but an anime that I would actively try make it disappear from the face of the anime world.",

            "content": "I'd rate this somewhere between 6 and 7 out of 10. For the purpose of critiquing, I'm putting it at a 6, but (for now) in my own list, I've rated it 7. I've done my best not to give spoilers, so at times it may feel vague, but I've revealed my concerns.\nWhile Kyoto Animation has always handled its art and animation amazingly well, taking 2D frame animation and its characters towards a more realistic depiction, with much fluidity, pacing, and expressive body and facial language, it feels as if they're falling into the trap of exhibitionism. I'd watch them any time for aesthetic service.But, it's the fanservice they forcefully put in that bothers me. It takes the story away from itself, away from its genre, away from its characters that could have otherwise been strong. Kyoukai no Kanata held a lot of potential, both character as well as concept-wise, but in the end, it felt like your mind was toyed with and taken for granted.\\n\\n\nStory 7/10:\\n\nSupernatural beings, fighting to save the world, relationships... all said and seen. \\n\nThe first episode starts off with an awkward saviour-confession by Akihito Kanbara, who is just then stabbed by Mirai Kuriyama. Like, okay... odd.  But interesting. AND character-defining. \\n\nWe soon follow up with the supernatural setting, an introduction to other characters whose relationship is not immediately clear, but we then slip into a mode of acceptance as page by page, the sequences slowly reveal us the nature of the plot. It feels like a game world. Probably conceived with such intentions too that it may be developed into a game (have not read the light novel by Nagomu Torii, supported by Chise Kamoi's artwork). \\n\nIt seems simple enough - living, killing, earning - until somewhere midway, we are introduced to stronger youmu they have to fight off, and then we learn about the existence of \"Kyoukai no Kanata\" and its sense in that world, and the complexity it entails. \\n\nThen of course, to add some comedy and spice, there are those blush moments. Thankfully, it's not too cheesy, but it does feel forced at certain points. It's just the fanservice that ruins it all. \\n\nI would say that the concepts are strong. But the adaptation juxtaposed with the characters, makes the ink bleed all over.\\n\\n\nArt 10/10:\\n\nWhat more can I say? I'd watch KyoAni's animation any time for its pure eye romance. The colours and forms are beautiful. The character motions are fluid, action sequences are full (you might see GIFs popping up a lot now), and even if incomplete, they give a sense of awesomeness. The art direction is beautiful, has subtleties, and does not stagnate. The eyes have something to see always. The landscapes are gorgeous, and we see demons in new shapes and forms. They've experimented, with and away. The visuals at the end show the creativity. \\n\\n\nSound 10/10:\\n\nUsually the sounds for me are a little hard to get by, not because I'm so drowned into a sequence I don't hear it (okay, that does happen) but more because of the way I follow subtitles, and especially series that are full of dialogues. I keep pause-playing. So although my experience as such has been choppy, there were times when i went back to a sequence just to hear the soundtrack. It's well done, and though I watch low quality, I can say that the sounds and the sound tracks are rich. (I remember liking Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun's sounds similarly well). Even the OP and ED are really well done - the tune is stuck to my head, and I find myself slipping into it on my metro journeys through the day. \\n\\n\nCharacter 6/10:\\n\nLike... uhh... whaaaaat??? Like... really... whaaaaat?\\n\nConsidering the character-defining moment that we see during the first moments of the first episode, the subsequent development just makes you wonder whether you're supposed to be watching slice-of-life, rom-com, or if these characters really were supposed to hold that much depth that they claim to make through the show which has a dark complex plotline. You hear them make claims about themselves, you hear them talk about and trying to confront their pasts and scars, but the next moment you see them fanservicing you with photoshots of cosplay outfits, and that one mid-point HIDEOUS episode of wtf-idol-singing-to-a-youmu(??!!??!!??!!!!!!??!). Like... uhhh... whaaaat the hell just happened??\\n\nIt's SOO convenient. SOO played over by the industry. And Akihito's mother is an amazing stereotypical wtf-character who not only embarrasses the characters within the show but it embarrasses the show itself and KyoAni's attempts. Even if you're introducing such weird characters, I feel that there's a way that it can be handled without losing integrity, without falling into the trap of usual fanservice otaku culture. It creates a disjuncture with the plot. It disturbs the mind. It makes the complexity of the sinister plot look pathetic. To me, it is NOT at all entertainment. \\n\nHiroomi's hands on Akihito's waist and his sister-complex were fine, even Akihito's perversion, I don't mind, since he IS in that puberty age. But the duality by held especially Mirai and Akihito, did not hold together. At one point, you wonder if it's okay since they ARE supposed to be kids. I can also agree that a dark character will also find time to goof around and feel light. I'm not saying it's not possible to escape your past and really enjoy the little things of the present, but then the depiction of those characters have to be able to bear that personality. Here, it just shatters it and makes them look cheesy and artificial - waaaay behind the realistic adaptation that KyoAni seeks in its animation. It's trying to combine the mental ages of 6 and 40. \\n\nI'm sick of maid outfits and cat costumes. Move ON people. The comedy elements were really forced. \\n\nBy the end of the show, there is so much depth to especially the two main characters, and you see them mature, but when you look back, you wonder where it came from. how all of that could lead them to harbour those emotions. It feels like a facade. It was rushed. It was awkward. \\n\nA good example of duality would be Watamote, which had a wonderful character who was able to handle the duality and the complexity of her personality and the conflicting emotions. Mirai and Akihito felt like wannabe-brood-stories. I'm not asking for a binary cut, but the distance between their pain and pleasures shouldn't be soooo wide. It's just hard to digest and relate to. \\n\nApart from them, the rest of the characters were the flat-type. They felt singular and more true to their tropes, which gelled better with the main genre of the show. I'd say the depiction of Sakura and Izumi held their characters much much better. However, we are left with a lot of unanswered questions with the claim of the matters being carpeted. The reasons for the climax, the character dialogues and revelations and secrecy at the end, felt more like a cover-up of failures. It's hard to see what a second season can do.. whether it can really progress because it feels like it would just be a drawl. \\n\\n\nEnjoyment 7/10:\\n\nFor a large portion, I was ignoring the fanservice. My only sources of enjoyment were the art, the OSTs and the concept and its visualisation. \\n\\n\nOverall 6/10:\\n\nIt irks me what this show could have been. I'm imagining Death Note and Darker Than Black, even Guilty Crown. Though none are KyoAni, but they could have looked into the genre. They've tried fusing kiddy slice of life with dark supernatural and it fell apart, for me atleast. I wouldn't even call it slice of life. There was nothing like that here. \\n\\n\nRecommendation to others:\\n\nYou can definitely pick it up. It's worthwhile to note the possibilities of stories, and its visualisation, and even certain character quirks despite how it failed here. Pick it up for some eye candy. But keep your distance. I'll say that the ending is really a yo-yo they play with your head and heart, so you'll feel like wtf there, but I guess it's not that bad a try. Failures should also be noted. KyoAni tried something new, good for them. I hope they learn and make better decisions.",

A \"dark fantasy\" led by the director Ishidate Taichi and animated by one of the best companies, at least animation-wise. But they tend to make mistakes in the end, and they did, or not... I'll try to explain.\r\nThe ending was amazing, if KnK had been a 2-cour serie, or a movie. Somehow, they tried to wrap things like there is no tomorrow (well, there is no tomorrow), and failed, specially with theinter-characters development. Mirai loves Akkey and vice-versa, but it completely lacks the drama that good animes have like: If you're  going to keep your feelings to yourself until the bitter end, then finish with a bang!!!. Sometimes the story simply lost itself, if the arcs had been made as separate OVA's, it would not change anything, since that they didn't need each other to keep the story moving (except the first and the last one, I mean, characters have to be introduced somehow). But even if there was no link between the arcs, it was quite fun to watch, the characters were fun, the animation was really well done, the songs were amazing (another \"thumbs up\" for Kyoani - they sure know how to insert songs in the middle of the show -). I enjoyed a lot, but I was expecting a lot more, given the staff that made it. \\n\r\nFinally, I had great fun watching it, and I hope for a 2nd season, since the plot had so many holes in it.",

It's ok. BUT this is not it's best trait: The way they are able to convey the character's emotions and feelings to the viewer in many ways got me attached. Some episodesmight be considered fillers, but in some way contributes to the plot and character development, this also helped the characters to have a stronger bond than most anime. The plot begins to become deep towards episode 11, and by the end of 12, you'd be asking what was going on. This causes you to be pulled in and also makes you want to watch the movie. (Spoiler) Mirai loses her memory and makes my feelings crumble, and Akihito just wants her to lead a normal life so he puts aside his past feelings for her in which makes me all the more interested. However, if slow-paced anime are a turn-off for you, you might not want to watch this.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Watching Kyoukai no Kanata is like riding a train but as it moves, it goes down spiral, into the abyss, and finally reaches trainwreck at the shadow of the pit. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the show has quite an promising premise with the style of a dark fantasy genre. It\u2019s something that Kyoto Animation haven\u2019t tried before in the past so Kyoukai no Kanata should set its par high with this new style, right? Wrong. This series is fails at various levels and if you\u2019re expecting a deep engaging story with well developed characters, then look somewhere else. It doesn\u2019t break any boundary or gobeyond its generic setting. Instead, it presents a story that is almost laughable. And no, I\u2019m not laughing.\\n\\n\r\nKyoukai no Kanata is an animated series based off the light novel of the same name written by Nagomu Torii. (artwork: Tomoyo Kamoi) The series takes a new turn by adapting the style of dark fantasy in a modern time era involving a group of students whom seems normal at first but contains a dark secret. That secret being that some of them are not human but instead are gifted with abnormal abilities. They use those abilities to save people and combat against the youmu. Ironically, one of the main characters is half youmu but finds himself fighting on the side of humanity as he embraces his destiny. \\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation is known for animating various titles with a school life setting but rarely ever incorporates the usage of actual supernatural themes into them with touch of darkness or despair. Series such as Hyouka, Chuunibyou, and the recently Free all never ventured into the supernatural zone that bought viewers to attention. Now finally in this show, there\u2019s actual otherworldly elements that and fans should be grateful for. The initial premise also brings forth a promising start with its small cast of characters and plot. It starts out with an attempted suicide by a young girl named Mirai Kuriyama. After saving her, we witness strange events among its residents as the world they know it becomes a distorted by supernatural entities that threatens their very own existence.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of the series takes place in a modern time era with the typical school life of our characters. Among our main characters includes Akihito Kanbara, a half-human and half-youmu with a gifted ability of regeneration, Mirai Kuriyama with the talent of blood manipulation, the spirit warrior Mitsuki Nase, and her older brother Hiiromi Nase. These four characters makes the ingredients of this show that give Kyoukai no Kanata its odd flavor. Most of them hardly connect at all with their lack of characterization. Almost all their conversations lacks any sort of dynamics but is instead replaced with irrational jokes, meaningless development, and overall a fragile depth. None of the characters stands out on their own either. Mirai is decorated with adorableness that is further evidenced by those noticeable round glasses, petite figure, and nerviness around others. Perhaps also colored as a natural klutz, there is almost nothing that stands out with her being part of this series. On the other hand, Akihito makes more of a presence but for absurd reasons such as his glasses fetish and preposterous humor. His relationship with Mirai is quite empty and can hardly be noticeable at all. In fact, there is hardly any romance between the duo nor any depth. They seem to exist the complete opposite together like oil and water. The Nase siblings aren\u2019t any interesting either considering their constant bickering and Hiiromi\u2019s heavily implied sister complex. \\n\\n\r\nThis series\u2019 overall plot execution should be considered a travesty of justice. The plot has many holes that are left wide open thanks to the way of its execution. The way most of the characters are part of the series\u2019 plot often ends in what I can see as rushed sequences. Conflicts are resolved abruptly without proper morals. Back stories seems interesting at first but overall lacks any depth or interest because it\u2019s hard to relate to the characters. This is also shown with the way characters are designed. Mirai is a prominent example as her history with a certain character of the series left her with \u201cscars\u201d. However, her present character shows little to none of those scars until confronted directly. Even afterwards, her interactions with that character is seemingly blushed off as just another event in her past life; a rushed one at that as well. There\u2019s also hardly any depth into the story except sticking with the concept of fighting youmu and saving people. This doesn\u2019t always go in the way they want either with one particular episode that becomes an absurd parody with dancing aesthetics. Least to say, Kyouki no Kanata didn\u2019t go beyond the boundary. It didn\u2019t hit anywhere near home because of its poor writing and construction. There are backstories and reasoning revealed later on but to save them near its ending phases and makes viewers to wait patiently doesn\u2019t cut out right.\\n\\n\r\nAction wise, the series is executed well thanks to Kyoto Animation\u2019s fluid execution.  Scenes involving fighting are presented with rapid movements accompanied by its majestic atmosphere. Mirai\u2019s rare ability also spills blood that marks the trace of its grim reality of dark fantasy. The youmu race also present a supernatural feel of explicit malevolence because of their existence; it is mentioned that youmi exists as result of negative emotions. Because of this, they spread that negative influence towards others.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the show being dark and perhaps explores a more psychological side to its story, the series also contains comedy. Unfortunately, the presentation and delivery of that comedy is laughable in the wrong way. There is little chemistry in the way dialogues are delivered because the character interactions of this series lacks depth. Mirai\u2019s character is generic with her annoying catchphrase that fits perfectly with its uninteresting style. The implied sister complex throughout the series becomes a distraction that\u2019s hard to take seriously. And although the series avoid the typical beach episode, it doesn\u2019t evade its poor parody or oddly coordinated fan service scenes. If the series wants us to take it seriously, then it should follow that pattern. But if it wants to make a few jokes here and then, it should at least make sense. Nonetheless, it follows down a path of despair with no decent delivery. I honestly don\u2019t know what went wrong here. Perhaps it's because of the director Taichi Ishidate but he was known to deliver series such as Full Metal Panic: Second Raid that actually explored psychological of despair. Here, the direction is off and the timing is misplaced in many of its moments. Overall, it\u2019s hard to take this show seriously despite its dark genre as it sometimes falls into the slice of life zone, other times with some story depiction ending in senseless solutions. You\u2019ll see some of this yourself if you decide to give the series a try. It\u2019s almost like dichotomy and becomes intolerable. \\n\\n\r\nThanks to Kyoto Animation\u2019s production values, it\u2019s safe to say that the series is saved in some ways by its scenery and visuals. The artwork for this show is magnificent with rich depth in terms of visual production. Most of the youmu gives off their threatening appearance that makes them a dangerous adversary for the Spirit Warriors. The character designs are typical with Kyoto Animation involved such as Mirai\u2019s dose of moe. Mitsuki\u2019s character gives off her coldness towards most of the others that is a reflection to the way she looks. Background wise, everything fits well and makes sense when the series decides to venture into the dark fantasy region. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is consistent with its tone. Because the series takes on a dark fantasy theme, it adapts a more eerie OST. Comedy wise though, there are moments when the OST loses balance of itself thanks to its poor execution. The action scenes incorporates good usage of its soundtrack especially with the intense atmosphere it gives off. Likewise, more emotional scenes makes decent usage of its OST to reflect the mood. Both the OP and ED songs also gives off a soft pacing for its mood. Mirai\u2019s VA (Risa Taneda) plays her role well that fits the voice of a shy character. Others such as Mitsuki and Akihito also are consistent with their voice mannerisms.\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, this series didn\u2019t meet the expectations I had in mind. The initial premise had potential. Unfortunately, the characters becomes a major problem with their lack of characterization, interactions, and personalities. Most of the plot/arc hardly makes any sense especially with their resolutions. This doesn\u2019t help by the fact that there is a improper timing with comedic scenes or dialogues. Instead, the dialogues usually falls apart with odd conversations such as involving the male characters\u2019 fetishes. The technical aspect of this show is decent in terms of production especially with its powerful visuals courtesy of Kyoto Animation. The action scenes also makes up a decent base for shounen like battles with touches of dark fantasy. However, this doesn\u2019t excuse the ultimatum of the show being mediocre. \\n\\n\r\nAs Mirai would write in her blog that she often gets flamed for, I would also say that Kyoukai no Kanata/Beyond the Boundary is best concluded with \u201chow unpleasant\u201d.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Damn, I feel like one of the few people who really really loves Kyoukai no Kanata on this damn site. I guess it's explaining time because as I really really like it I want it to have a halfway decent review. (especially since most of these seem written from a bias perspective from someone who only watched the first 3 episodes.\r\nKyuokai is not perfect, but it makes up for a lot of its flaws with gorgeous animation good laughs and a completely enjoyable ride the whole way through. The story of KnK definitely isn't original in the slightest to start off. Like everyone is sayingsupernatural girl meets immortal boy and they fall in love, and while people may whine that unoriginality just leads to a total shit fest I think that if something works and is enjoyable that's what matters the most, and while originality is always a plus (like in SnK's case) it is not necessary for a good anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhere KnK shines is in it's art and it truly is breathtaking. There are so many scenes that evoke emotions beautifully and really just make it an artistic masterpiece in it's own right. It's one of those anime that could be absolutely terrible and the art alone could save it. Luckily the rest is not terrible it's all at least acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nThe character's and character development are also high points in this anime. The characters all interact very realistically even if they are reused tropes. The animations of the characters face in a particular scene helps portray the emotions in that respective character in a very real well that leaves it so that there is no need for talking and there is a lot of silence in this anime that leaves the watcher to just look at the beautiful scenery which is where KnK shines the most and it definitely knows it does. The characters also develop so well having episodes where characters slowly become closer to each other instead of leaving it to be implied and that's a very good thing. (Funny enough a lot of people see these episodes as \"filler\" episodes, I do not agree, but maybe I'm just more optimistic and think Kyoani is smarter than that)\\n\\n\r\nAnother very enjoyable aspect of KnK is the level of mysticism it portrays and even if it is an overused overarching story it does a very good job at not feeling stale in the slightest. I believe it does this best through the soundtrack which is absolutely stunning and great to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nMany people are shit talking the story in KnK and I believe that while it is partially justified it also partially isn't because KnK isn't linear. There isn't one story and it seems to fly by very fluidly instead of feeling like there is X arc then X arc it just feels like it passes very nicely. The pacing feels nice and it's overall just very enjoyable to get through.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end KnK is enjoyable, the art is great and the characters and story feel to flow very well. There are flaws and those are not to be ignored; however, it is DEFINITELY not nearly as bad as people like to think it is. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will feel satisfied at the end of it.",

            "content": "\"Judgement prevent us from seeing the good that lies beyond appearances.\"\r\n-Wayne Dyer\r\nThere is one thing I will rarely, if ever, do. That is give the show a rating before watching the entire show through. That doesn't mean that I don't have preconceived notions about the show and have some idea how I'm going to rate it. As a human being, I am flawed with the inability to look at something objectively from the beginning. That being said, I felt like I should take the time to address all the people somehow climbing over each other trying to stick his or her opinion down the throat'sof other people. Here is my humble opinion: Kyoukai no Kanata was, at the very least, a show worth watching. Here's why.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nWhy do I rate it so? Most anime shows - at least for me - have some sort of glimmer of light that seems to catch my eye. (Of course this is for me personally, so don't be snapping on my words). There is something interesting that pulls me in that makes me want to watch the show. For me, originally, it was the story. Of course, that was just a preconceived notion I had; the story was interesting. Now, after finishing Kyoukai no Kanata, am I disappointed? Not really...though it is personal preference. There were parts I didn't like. There were parts I thought were well done. Was it perfect? No. It was still interesting to me though. There were issues with plot execution that made me a little sad, but that didn't make the overall show horrible. In my experience, there are shows far worse. Many many shows. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nWell, KyoAni never fails to pull off at least semi decent art. Kyoukai no Kanata is no exception. To me, the art was colorful and fit well with the story. I won't go too far into it, but honestly, it looked good. Well, being KyoAni, the art was magnificent. The scenery was beautiful and the visuals blew me away.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThis rating is probably a little high for some of you. But I really enjoyed the OST. It isn't the best, that's for sure, but it was beautiful enough for each scene the show had. And I really enjoyed the opening and ending. Of course, because the story itself was a little sketchy in its execution, the OST lost a little \"oomph\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nOkay, this part is entirely subjective. Everyone has his or her own opinion. But I thought that with the episode restraint, the characters all had at least a little development with some exceptions. I found it a little strange that all the main characters had such distinction from everyone else, but then again, it could have been worse.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, each character was unique. They had strange quirks and it made the show fun to watch. Despite the show itself being somewhat dark, I was able to get a few laughs from the character interaction. I know that opinion is subjective in its own, but honestly, we all have our own opinions. To me, the character interaction was fun and made my Wednesday's more enjoyable. Watching the characters bicker was by no means unpleasant to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThe show wasn't a complete failure. In fact, I could only say that Kyoukai no Kanata was like the majority of the shows out there. Great in some ways, and rather not so great in others. But the show, in its entirety, was better than a lot of others things I watched. It probably wouldn't be anywhere near the best, but it was enjoyable to say the least. I had my laughs. I had my teary-eyed moments. I grew angry. I was sad. Though the show failed to pull me completely in one direction, I was able to get a wide array of emotions, and it was beautiful to me. The show was beautiful in so many ways. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nAll I can truly say is this: don't judge this show without finishing it. Feel free to disregard what I think of the show. In the end, everyone's review reflects his or her opinion. Even the most professionally written review here on MAL has some subjectivity. I don't condone that. But no one can judge how you like a show but YOU. And if you arrive to a conclusion based on what little you see, because you watched a few episodes, you may or may not be robbing yourself of a good experience. So many times, shows I find to be a good experience to watch happen to have controversial ratings. That doesn't mean the person reading this will find this show to be something they like to watch. Reading my review over again, I can say that it is a measly attempt at an objective review. So...\\n\\n\r\nHere's what I'll say: don't reach a conclusion based on reviews or ratings. At least give the show a chance. Perhaps looking beyond such things you will find a show worth watching. Perhaps not. Only you can judge if this show is truly as [un]pleasant as others say it to be. \\n\\n\r\nI wish you all the best in your pursuit of anime.",

            "content": "\"No amount of great animation will save a bad story.\"-John Lasseter\r\n   When news came out that Kyoto Animation was going to make a supernatural anime me like many others were surprised and excited. A supernatural show with great animation made by one of the most popular anime studios in japan? What could possibly go wrong with Kyoukai No Kanata? Almost everything,apparently.\r\n   The story is set in a fictional world where Supernatural creatures called Youmu exist. Youmu come in various shapes and sizes. Although most Youmu are harmless. Some could be hostile and dangerous. To stop these Youmu from harminghumans there exists spirit world warriors, warriors with special powers who kill dangerous Youmu and keep balance to the world. The story revolves around Half youmu, Akihiro Kanbaru who saves a girl named Kuriyama Mirai, a spirit world warrior with the power to control her blood.\\n\\n\r\n   Sounds promising right? What went wrong? The first problem with Kyoukai No Kanata is its lack of direction. Kyoukai No Kanata is supposed to be a dark fantasy. But as the show progresses to the middle the show feels like more like a slice of life with a bit of comedy than a dark anime. The biggest offense is the idol episode. An episode that is pretty much a fan pandering episode in an attempt to boost sales. That may have boosted sales. But after that episode I really couldn't take this anime seriously anymore.\\n\\n\r\n   Apart from that there are also other problems with the story. But alot of times there is alot of unneccesary humor. I mean, a few laughs here and there are fine but too much just kills the atmosphere of the show. And it would have helped if the comedy was actually funny. But most of the comedy came up at the wrong time and felt forced. \\n\\n\r\n   The characters aren't much better either. There are 4 main characters of the show. Kanbaru Akihito, Kuriyama Mirai, Nase Mitsuki, and Nase Hiroomi. Kyoto Animations signature character designs look great. Mirai looks as cute as ever with her glasses and the others looked quite nice too. But looking deeper into them. They all feel one sided. Aside from her moe character design and clumsy personality there really isn't much to her. She doesn't do anything to stand out and I really couldn't relate to her at all. Akihito isn't good either. His glasses obsession is really annoying and pretty much the only thing that makes him different from other characters. The chemistry between them is also pretty lacking and one can only wonder if Akihito actually likes Mirai for her or for her glasses. The Nase siblings aren't remotely interesting either. So excuse me for not writing about them because there really isn't much to write about.\\n\\n\r\n   On a brighter note the Animation is quite detailed which is quite expected from Kyoto Animation. The backgrounds are all done beautifully. Character designs all looked great. The action scenes were also done nicely. But one small thing that I noticed is that Kyoto Animation is still slightly inexperienced in battle scenes. Although most of the movements were fluid some of the camera angles felt a bit awkward. This doesn't detract too much from the whole experience but I can't help think that with that amount of budget the battle scenes could have looked better. \\n\\n\r\n   The sound is also very good. Minori Chihara brings off an outstanding opening \"Kyoukai No Kanata\". An opening that fit with the show quite well. The ending song \"Daisy\" is also a very nice song done by Stereo Dive Foundation. The soundtrack also fit the show well. Everything from the action scenes to the comedy scenes were all fit with nice pieces. If only the story was as good as the sound...\\n\\n\r\n   Kyoukai No Kanata was a major disappointment for me. Not because of how bad it was. But because of what it could have been. Kyoukai No Kanata had alot of potential. But bad execution and bland characters stopped it from becoming something truly special.\\n\\n",

            "content": "For quite the long time, people have exposed their wishes for Kyoani, notable for their several slice of life series with high quality animation, to do something else other than the slow moe-filled series they're famous for. After years of exploring safe territory, they finally announced the highly antecipated supernatural series Kyoukai no Kanata. And with that, set themselves up for what is probably their biggest failure in the last few years.\r\nWhether they failed because the transition from slice of life to dark fantasy was too abrupt for them to handle or because they simply do not care for quality anymore, we can't be sure.We can just say for sure that Kyoukai no Kanata went wrong in every single aspect you can imagine, for simultaneously doing too much and nothing at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise is simple and somewhat clich\u00e9: half-human, half-youmu high school boy meets fighter girl who manipulates blood and kills youmu for a living. From this encounter, various events unfold. And that's just how it goes. The plot is all over the place; it constantly jumps around between episodes with moe and plain fanservice at its finest to plot-relevant episodes that actually accomplish nothing at all. It goes from fighting to unappealing drama to unfitting comedy to dancing idols. Yes, you heard me right: dancing idols. You should get a feel about how hard they are trying from that.\\n\\n\r\nIt's like the show can't decide whether it's light-hearted or dramatic. The \"dark fantasy\" label loses all of its meaning when over half of the screentime is spent on flat jokes and the protagonist dressed in costumes for fanservice purposes. The flow of the plot is ragged and it feels like a lot of scenes are incomplete or were cut out from how things are thrown in out of nowhere. Even when things do start to get half-decent, it means nothing when all of the scenes and episodes before that were messy and unfocused. They just feel like lucky pieces of candy in a colorful box full of rocks.\\n\\n\r\nAs if that's not enough, there is also an incredibly high number of asspulls happening for the sake of melodrama (the final scene alone is one of the single most gigantic asspulls I've ever seen in any piece of fiction), and roughly one or two out of all the plot-related points are explained. The whole story is weak, sloppy and unsatisfying from beginning to ending.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the cast of characters is very fitting to such plot. There's more of them than the show can handle, and they all feel ultimately forced. Our female lead, Mirai, is a typical bland airhead ditzy moe uguu anime girl who's more defined by her overused catchphrase than by her personality traits. Our protagonist, Akihito, seems to be defined as a whole by his fetish for glasses and nothing more. The main cast closes with the Nase siblings Mitsuki and Hiromi, who are an obvious pretext for shoving incest jokes where they don't belong, but are surprisingly the best characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nLike the plot, they are more like sketches that jump around inside their respective stereotypes than actual finished, fully-written characters. They have every kind of adornment you can ask for - catchphrases, defining quirks, canon hobbies, superpowers, fetishes and whatnot - but lack what matters the most: depth that allows them to break free from their respective archetypes. They abuse of Mirai's \"how unpleasant\" catchprase, Akihito's fetish for glasses and Hiromi's siscon so much that watching them becomes absolutely cringe-worthy at some point. They're so empty that sometimes the dialogue about their motivations needs to be filled with these things when the pseudo-depth inserted by unecessary drama won't cut it. The only one out of the main four who actually feels like a character and not a scribble on the last page of a notebook is Mitsuki, but she alone isn't enough to save the character interactions from being a feast of awkward catchphrase exchanges.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast isn't much better than the main cast. Some of them instigate conflict for reasons that are never explained, some of them just exist without ever doing anything relevant or even being fun to watch (I'm looking at you, Ai Shindou), some of them are likeable but butchered by terrible writing. The main antagonist is bland and unreasonable. Some of the characters literally just fade away in the very last episode with little to no explanation given. Most of them never go through character development of any sort, and reach the ending of the series without having gone through any changes at all. They are a group of characters with a sparkle of potential that was thrown inside of the water, making them useless - there's really no other way to put it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is decent; it is Kyoani after all. The action scenes looked pretty fluid and the characters had good expressions and movements. Not their best, but definitely not bad. The character designs, although not ugly, are really boring and generic. Not much to say about the sound. The voice acting was fine, so was the music, and the only thing that stood out were the OP and ED themes. The art and sound were overall fair and not really bad.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, is Kyoukai no Kanata enjoyable? In some sort of twisted way, it is. As much as you can't help it but noticing how ridiculous and poorly done the whole thing is, it's most likely that it won't bore you. You may get increasingly frustrated with the amount of wasted potential and lazy writting, but you won't get bored. Kyoani's biggest disappointment might be a good thing to go with if you just want something silly to kill time.\\n\\n\r\nFinal scores, tl;dr\\n\r\nStory: 2/10 - Jumps around, plot is all over the place, tries to focus on so many things that succeeds in nothing.\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 6/10 - Not too impressive, but overall pretty decent.\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10 - Empty, defined by their quirks and catchphrases, lacking depth and development completely\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10",

            "content": "Despite the various bad comments and reviews panning this series, I took a leap of faith and decided to watch it. I must say that, although not the best anime of all time, it is an enjoyable anime series.\r\nWith a length of 12 episodes, Kyoto Animation's \"Kyoukai no Kanata (Beyond the Boundary)\" brings us a tale of two young teenagers, whose hearts are filled with regrets and burdens placed on their shoulders. Their actions will determine the fate of humanity itself, and while at that, they will draw near each other as they learn more about themselves and come to terms with their hardships. Itis an excellent story about two ill-fated youngsters with a fresh sci-fi twist. \\n\\n\r\nNext, I will give you certain characteristics of the series that I find necessary to tell to those who are considering watching this series, as well as the premise. (TL;DR/Conclusions at the end.)\\n\\n\r\nStory and characters:\\n\r\nThe world is protected by Spirit Warriors, which have multiple powers to keep demon-esque creatures, called the \"yomu\" in line from attacking humanity. Then there's this certain Spirit Warrior girl with the name of Mirai Kuriyama. She is a Spirit Warrior, whose bloodline is considered cursed, that allows her to manipulate her blood as a weapon, such as a shield or a blade.  This feature is considered cursed, and as a consequence, she is constantly isolated by the rest of the Spirit Warrior community. Akihito Kanbara is a hybrid of half-yomu and half-human. This uncommon mixture grants him the power to be immortal, although he is not a Spirit Warrior. He, just like Mirai, is another outcast of society because of the strange anomaly that he is. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is all about the burdens that these two characters, Akihito Kanbara and Mirai Kuriyama, have to carry; and the relationship between these two, that begins to grow and flourish as the series progresses. We are thrown into this compelling and exciting world with close to no information about what's going on, and much of it comes through dialog between the characters. This is all about showing, not telling. The bad side of this is that you can get easily lost if you don't pay enough attention, but the good one is that time is not wasted by explaining. \\n\\n\r\nThe narrative starts slow paced, with a focus on introducing the characters and their qualities, fetishes and catchphrases:  It is more like a slice of life anime, with each episode having a yomu and being fought by the main characters, and in-between, we see how the characters interact as if they are living a completely normal life; but as the series progresses, the plot starts to gain momentum and delivers a well balanced dose of comedy, action, drama and a shot of romance, as these two outcasts begin to draw together. Near the end, the loose ends are being tied up and the hidden motivations explained, as well as the tension begins to rise exponentially.  I have to say that by the end of the series, my hands were clinched as the narration becomes way faster and entertaining than in the beginning (I actually considered dropping it by the third episode). Some episodes focus more on side stories, rather than the actual storyline. Although they are enjoyable and entertaining, they do kill some momentum from the previous episodes. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the series is itself more a drama series than a comedy series, there are a lot of laughs that can be found between the difficult events that lead to the climax. All the characters are excellently designed, all having a certain aspect of their personality that makes their interactions with one another really funny and enjoyable overall, being the episode 6 the pinnacle of the comedy in this series.\\n\\n\r\nA big flaw I find in the series is that one of the enemy's goal or motive is never stated. It gave you a vague explanation of what he was doing, but didn't give a clear motive. Although at last he is not the main enemy, I would have liked some closure on him. (I won't say the name of the character, to avoid spoilers.) In a similar fashion, some of the supporting cast is largely ignored for big part of the series. Even though these slips, I consider the story and characters well designed.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound:\\n\r\nThe art was astounding and is really one of the strongest areas of the series, if not the strongest. It is one of the greatest series that I've seen when it comes to animation. This series makes you want to take a screenshot of every scene and make it your newest wallpaper for your cellphone: The shots are so beautifully colored and detailed and the sequences are so fluid and eye catching that it stuns you every time an action scene comes up and the special effects come to effect. Nothing less than expected from a work by Kyoto Animation. I really think that this was the factor that made me continue the series, despite my consideration of dropping it. The music is also remarkable. Although it is not the greatest soundtrack I've heard, the OST blends well into the environment and the scenes. The opening and ending find I really fitting to the story and premise; as well as the insert song in episode 6.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and final thoughts (TL;DR):\\n\r\nAt first, I wasn't really enjoying the series. It was really hard for me to give full attention and avoid being distracted while watching the very first episodes. But as the series progressed, the more momentum it gained and by episode 6, I couldn't get my eyes off it. (It specially is episode 6 a really hysterical one. It had been long since I had genuinely laughed with an anime series.) Despite many critics panning this series, I really liked it.  I can say that this is not the best anime I\u2019ve seen, but I don\u2019t regret the time I spent watching it. But well, this is just, like, my opinion, man.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Kyoukai no Kanata is an amazing series. It\u2019s got well designed characters, a captivating and credible love story, attention-catching premise, beautiful scenery worth a wallpaper, and fluid sequences. Although I believe the series starts slow and sloppy, if you like sci-fi, beautiful art and/or romance and drama, I highly recommend you this series, and please, don't reach any conclusion based on reviews, since everybody can have different opinions. \\n",

            "content": "\"Fools have a habit of believing that everything written by a famous author is admirable. For my part I read only to please myself and like only what suits my taste.\" ~Voltaire~\r\nKyoukai no Kanata was by no means a very ambitious project (or a very pretentious subject). It had very linear and straight forward story line which actually very easy to understand and very comfy to follow, delivered with excellent animation and a proper adolescence romance development ... is probably an understatement. But, saying it was the best foreshadowing is also an exaggeration.\r\nFor starters, the anime was built upon a very basic concept: human withsupernatural power, hunting monster. Well, I can get the hunch of where all this 'generic' spouting comes from. But the foundation itself was built upon several layers, in which each layer redefine the rough concept and premise into its own unique traits. So, on the surface, it does looks like any supernatural anime which comes from before 2005. But, if we take a closer look, the show didn't follow the usual formula for a show which tagged: \"teen, supernatural, fantasy, anime\" in which I'll call it 'chuuni anime' for shorts. So, that was also explain very polar opposite receptions by fans.\\n\\n\r\nThe main idea behind the story is about seeking a new light at the other side of tunnel/boundary. Which is basically, what Mirai was trying to do. But of course its ot so easy as to flip the other side of a coin. There are also Akihito who has the same (more or less) state as Mirai. Yes, the story revolves between these two characters, starting from where their first encounter, their conflict, acceptance and longingness. This is one of very few shows which shows a proper teenage romantic development mostly due because they have a rather similar condition which makes them able relate to each other. That was the basic story concept.\\n\\n\r\nThe world was built upon nowadays era and civilization but with a little tweak, that there are monsters which lurking in the darkness, waiting to infect humans with its poisonous nature... or killed them, whatever bad effects they brought. All of this 'youmu' concept-building is shallow, weak, generic and so does the 'ikaishi' part. There are almost not enough explicit exposition in exploring both concepts, because its not your usual 'nerdy' chuuni shows which spouting something like 5 new vocabularies every 3 new episodes or so. The mixture of slice of life and supernatural in a sense is very pleasant, but in another sense was frightfully almost doesn't mix. The reason is maybe has something to do with this studio specialty, which is Slice of Life (SoL), and cute girls. The SoL part has more depth even when compared to any other SoL anime (let alone another chuuni anime). Their technique in mastering this particular aspect was just so excellently done. You could feel the atmosphere surrounding this show. Heck it does feels like watching someone bringing a mini-DV into 2D world. But this depth of exploring SoL side was a bit backfired. Every supernatural elements looks out of place. The youmu form for example, just looks like derived from a pok*mon game or something.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline was very linear as I said earlier, but it doesn't follow the regular formula which says \"beginning, middle, end\". Rather, it straight forward jump into a start-middle scene which left some people confused and screaming \"plot hole\" out loud. Well, this is to be expected, since that was how it was... in the beginning. I even have this tingling funny sensation when watching first 3 episodes. Why did they leave plot hole so open, and heck even pointed it out. Then, I understand it was a foreshadowing... which was revealed after episode 8. Here's the problem: This show tried to bring forth a whole huge concept story on to the table, which is actually very rare thing to see since all we've got were per-arc episode(s) which doesn't entangled to each other. So, we're used to a scheme where: 1st episode doing foreshadowing, then following episode (or two) does the revelation... which you can see in every single chuuni anime... ever..., also don't forget the explicit spoonfeeding. This show does none of those thing. which is why for some people, watching this show was kinda tiring. It could be understandable since this show requires huge amount of observation span and very long patience... which not many people have. As a proof, a lot of people doesn't recognize 'Sakura Inami' in her first confrontation with Mirai despite all the clues being littered throughout the show. (sorry, no further spoiler).\\n\\n\r\nThe execution is a bit flocky sometimes, but in general still pretty decent. But of course you still need to be observant and use a bit of deduction thinking in figuring how the world moves. Since there are barely any explicit long-ass chuuni dialogue in this show (I didn't say none). In directional stand-point is still also very flocky. There are some good-standout episode (like Takemoto ones), but there are also very bad ones. The reason why the difference in directional execution was so glaring might because there are almost no clean-up from the general director. The reson is..., well I don't know.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation..., is the core of this show. I could talk for hours regarding this topic, but lets just make it simple. The production quality of this product is simply..., outstanding. Kyoukai no Kanata looks like a saint compared to any other action anime. Well, you could say I was exaggerating, but as far as TV anime are concerned, there are very few other action anime which have this kind of production quality, not even SnK (sorry titan fans). There are no reused scene (except that single one from ep 6), no still images (except it was used in succession to create a sense of complex movement (e.g. ep 2, when Mirai slashed zombie youmu form the sand), it has sense of impact and sense of weight (like several scene in EoE), It doesn't have black screen followed by flashing effect, It doesn't have badly produced CG sequence(s), it has terrific inbetweening, but it does however has some share of bad cuts. For example in ep 2 where Mirai swinging her blood without sense of direction and ep 3..., you know that infamous 'timber'. Also, I don't know why, it has several 'copycat' key frames (not reused, but done in similar style). You might felt that the action scenes were a bit short compared to any other action shows. That was because 3 minutes action in this anime = 8 ~ 15 minutes in any other anime. Action flow were so packed and almost gives no room for chanting or engaging in conversation. Even if it does, it still managed to perfectly fit into the timing between action cuts. It doesn't sacrifice the loss of quality for sake of having flowing animation, which is actually a big plus into the animation department. And, lastly of course the shiny Kigami episode. (inb4 idol dancing episode)\\n\\n\r\nThe lightning and several effects were movie-tier. And small quirk and gestures from characters were delicious seasoning in this already well-produced show. The music (BGM) were a bit hit & miss, but in general was good, the sound directions were flawless. There are several effect of sound where people talk outside the door is different from inside the door. It also have distinct variation, where people talk up-close or faraway, left or right direction. The voice act for each characters were also very good. Several hiccups sure, but it does gets better once you used to. Some people might not overcome them, but of course different people = different taste buds. The opening and ending song were also very catchy. More over this is also one of very few anime which are using Op/ED sequence in layering one of episode, which is actually very neat works.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the ending..., THE ENDING, never forget the ending. By no means a satisfactory ending since it leaves so many questions and makes people a bit impatient. But as far as the main story concept was concerned, it was a...., well to be honest I'm not too satisfied with the ending too. Or maybe it was intentionally letting the viewer to interpret the ending as their imagination or their deduction just like Hyo*ka was.\\n\\n\r\nKyoukai no Kanata stands at the basis of simplicity and displayed as it is without sounding so deep or pretentious or dramatic. But because it started at that very simple idea, because of great directing, multilayer subtlety, and very long foreshadowing, it entices the viewer to at least pay attention to a bit of exposition without feeding needless explicit argument for the sake of understanding. At the end of the day, if you're someone who don't satisfied with action sequence in anime, if you don't want to exhaust yourself in complicated chuuni dialogue, if you're tired watching too many harem anime, or were just seeking for a nice, comfy action anime to spend on weekend or when you're tired from work/school. Kyoukai no Kanata does just that. I might advise to marathon it, at least it will eliminates the patience/impatience factor. But the observation will still there.",

            "content": "Pretty damn interesting show. Along the way I had some pretty mixed reactions, and feelings, however those negative feelings didn't stop me from enjoying Kyoukai no Kanata.\r\nStory- 8/10 \r\nYou can pretty much get a concept or idea of what the show is about by reading the description lol. That aside, the story was actually pretty decent.  Full of thrills, excitement, and feels. There were many events that I loved in the story, however my most favorite on-going thing about it was every episode (Including the stupid ones, yeah I'm talking about episode 6) had the right amount of enjoyment whether it was action orcomedy a majority of the events that had played out work out pretty well in my book.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's Kyoto animation or \"KyoAni\" .... of course they make characters, even characters you don't care about a bit more visually appealing or cute. That aside, the action scenes were visually spectacular!!! Even the scenes that had the feels to them were pretty great to look at.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I think the only thing I liked about the sound department was the ending song. I suppose I \"tuned\" out quite a bit when it came to BGM.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNot the best cast of characters, however after some time, I actually started to warm up to them. I have seen many shows where the perverted MC has some odd fetish, and this was or I think this was the first title I've seen where male MC has a glasses fetish.... so there's that. Moving on, Mirai, I wanted to hate her because unless they are loli's or magical girls that whole \"cutesy\" \"Shy\" \"Nervous\" archetype.. erhm.. character doesn't sit right with me. Especially in genre's that are action/fantasy. Now, there are handfuls of characters that I'm okay with that are \"as I listed above\" however, I just couldn't find myself at ease with Mirai.... UNTIL.. the middle of the series or the \"rising action.\" After seeing her act so selflessly, it really changed my opinions about her and made her a lot tolerable.. The others I honestly couldn't care too much about.... No, seriously.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, I thought Kyoukai no Kanata was pretty good.  It had its' good moments and bad however, in the end, it was still lots of fun re-watching. \\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts, I would recommend if you love shows with lots of action, developing romance and emotional moments. I had to give this show a 8/10 because it really was an unexpectedly good title from KyoAni",

            "content": "Kyoukai no Kanata is the newest anime from Kyoto Animation who is best known for their multitude of anime all about high school clubs and moe character designs. Kyoukai no Kanata is their first real attempt at a darker action series, despite having all of the previously mentioned aspects in addition to that. So how did this new genre attempt work? Given that it's in KyoAni's name you would expect this, Kyoukai no Kanata has beautiful animation which holds up both during action-packed scenes and the laid back ones. However, while the soundtrack is also good, the story suffers from having a poorly explained plotand setup as well as an average character cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins when our glasses-loving protagonist, Akihito, sees a girl on the roof of his school. He proceeds to make some monologue about suicide that seems like foreshadowing at the time but never really applies to anything later on as he calls out to the girl on the roof. The girl, whose name is Mirai, stabs him but fails to kill him as it turns out that Aikihito is immortal. Mirai is a novice \"Spirit World Warrior,\" people who fight creatures called \"youmu\" that are invisible to normal humans. Mirai had heard that Akihito was an immortal half-youmu and decided to get some practice by using him as a \"stabbing-bag\" which Akihito obviously did not appreciate. The story continues on as Akihito and Mirai grow closer together, discover secrets about each other, and get caught up in the plans of both other people and youmu.\\n\\n\r\nThe story suffers from a few things. It poorly introduces the world of youmu and Spirit World Warriors by skipping over some important details and saving them for later. Despite an entertaining filler episode, it comes at a bad time and interrupts a side story which interrupts the main story which leads to some confusion for the viewer. It also has a bit of a cop-out ending with things being a little rushed at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't all bad, but the good parts are mostly due to the relatively good main characters. The four main characters consist of Mirai, Akihito, and the siblings Mitsuki and Hiromi. Where the main characters hit their strongest points is in the sarcastic comedy between them. From Mirai's catchphrase \"you're unpleasant\" to Akihito and Hiromi's fetishes for glasses and younger sisters respectively to Mitsuki's disgusted sarcasm towards both guys, the characters never let the serious attitude of the story prevent them from being the normal sarcastic assholes that teenagers really are (or at least my group of friends is minus the fetishes). While their quirks may be a little overdone at times, they never become a hindrance to the story (well, not more than it was already doing on it's on). The minor characters are where some more noticeable issues arise. None of them get enough screen time to develop aside from maybe Ai-chan, and many of them are easily forgettable and hardly relevant to the plot at all. The few who are important are easily forgettable or just annoying like in the case of the obvious villain. Aside from Ai, the minor characters are basically all of the adults in the show and most of their designs are similar to the point where a few of them can be mixed up (this is one of the very few problems with the animation).\\n\\n\r\nBut onto the best part of this show. The fluid fight scenes, interesting character designs of the main characters (as long as you don't mind moe), and the beautiful scenery despite most of the show taking place in an average-looking Japanese town are what make the animation of this show top-notch. Even as far as KyoAni shows go, this one still stands out in this category (mainly due to it being one of the few with action sequences). One of the only issues is something which many anime have problems with: character designs become much less detailed when the characters are \"farther away\" from the camera. The soundtrack during the action scenes also adds to the intensity and makes them even more impressive. It also adds to the comedic/sarcastic moments and makes them even more of a pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 4/10\\n\r\nAnimation - 9/10\\n\r\nSoundtrack - 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters - 5/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\r\nOverall - 6.6/10\\n\\n\r\nKyoukai no Kanata is an enjoyable show with excellent animation, a good soundtrack, but unfortunately suffers from weak minor characters and an inconsistent plot with some pointless side features that distract from the real story. It all culminates in a visually impressive ending but makes little sense story-wise. I hope KyoAni (which is one of my favorite anime studios) continues to make visually amazing action series, but it would help if they improved the story of their next one.",

            "content": "Kyoukai no Kanata aka 'Beyond the Boundary' seems to be quite a controversial anime in a sense that  some people seem to love it i think, while others say its a let down. I think its brilliant and i loved it till the end. True it could be better. But every anime has areas it needs to improve in. The fall i would say about Kyoukai no Kanata is its potential. It has masses of it. I already think its amazing, but i think it has the potential to be even greater. There was simply not enough time allowed to truly explore and understandthe world and characters and to draw out its real potential. Like the past of Akihito and Mirai and there trauma's for example. Its something that should've been explored a bit more I feel. Also, I would've liked to know the other characters a bit better as well.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise I would say Kyoukai no Kanata is a breath of fresh air. Its original. Its unique and I adored it. The sad, darker undertone was covered brilliantly with hilarious quips and quirks that were admittedly a bit odd and awkward at times but hilarious none the less. I have no complaints about the art. The story line is undeniably linear and even somewhat predictable in some cases, but I don't think it takes away from the anime at all.\\n\r\nI fell there is a considerable amount of depth to Akihito and Mirai especially albeit there could be a tiny bit more for the other main characters.    The music compliments the moods and genre well and I adore the characters. Albeit I would like to get know the other characters a little better.\\n\\n\r\nIf i sound like Im singing Kyoukai no Kanata's praises as if the best anime in the world then let me make it clear that its because I wouldn't want others to overlook because of the various bad reviews it has. Since joining here I've found that people on this website can be exceedingly harsh in there judgment. There are other animes that far surpass Kyoukai No Kanata. But it is a diamond in the rough which i feel saddly has been undermined and I invite you to watch it and judge it for yourself\\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend it\\n",

            "content": "Following their high success with \"Free! Iwatobi Swim Club\" Kyoto Animation has done it again with the stellar fall anime \"Kyoukai no Kanata\". Overall, the series works with supernatural elements, such as the \"spirit world warriors\" and the \"youmu\".\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story of Kyoukai no Kanata is about protagonists Kuriyama Mirai and Kanbara Akihito. Students in high school, both extraordinary in different ways. Mirai is the only living member of the 'cursed' spirit world warrior clan that is able to manipulate blood. Akihito is a half-youmu, half-human, making him immortal. The story revolves around these two and their adventures, and the even mysterious \"Kyoukai no Kanata\"or \"Beyond the Boundary\". Kyoto Animation deemed this anime as a \"slice of life\" but I think it is anything but. Setting aside the filler episode, episode 6, Kyoukai no Kanata very much has a plot that is driven forward through the whole series. The plot is never really slow, and is intriguing with each episode. Kyoukai no Kanata has many different subject matter and themes that get your brain thinking.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nKyoto Animation has always been known for their beautiful, flawless animation and character design. None of this is forgotten in Kyoukai no Kanata. The atmosphere is set beautifully, each character's movement fluid and realistic. Battle scenes are works of art. There is never a time during the series where I questioned the animator's abilities. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI am not one to pay attention much to soundtracks,. but I must say that the soundtrack work in Kyoukai no Kanata fit with the mood. The OST is well suited for the scenes they are played during, and add to the atmosphere of the scene. As well, the voice actors are always on par, and portray each character distinctly, with the correct feelings and dramatization.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nFor a 12 episode anime, I believe the main characters are developed fairly well. Mirai Kuriyama, first of all, portrays as a sweet heart in the beginning. She is a cutie with bubble gum pink hair and red rimmed glasses. Over the series, I was delighted to see depth put into her character, and she was ultimately likable. She is not the kind of protagonist that sits around and waits for things to happen. She does not rely on other people for help, and ultimately is strong on her own. Kanbara Akihito has his quirks. And it's interesting to see these little quirks in action. He has a thing for glasses, often calling Mirai a \"megane bishoujo\" (bespectacled beauty). As for the other characters, each had distinctions that make them different from each other. For a time frame of 12 episodes, each character gets a relative amount of screen time suitable to their role.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nTo be honest, Kyoukai no Kanata is definitely my favourite of the season. It has been a long time since I have found dual protagonists (Mirai and Akihito) so likable. The ever present plot, the senseless fluff, the jokes, the quirks, all of it tied together had me enjoying Kyoukai no Kanata all the way through. While it depends on the person as to if they enjoy it or not, I dare say Kyoukai no Kanata is worth it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nFor all these reasons, I believe Kyoto Animation hit the mark with Kyoukai no Kanata. With the series finished and wrapped up, I can only hope for a second season to answer all the questions I still have. Kyoukai no Kanata is overall a superb anime that deserves a chance.",

            "content": "Kyoukai no Kanata. The very name conjures cryptic mystery and fantastical wonder. The world is divided into humans, and youmu. Here's my personal review of this fast, strange experience.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe concept of humans and monsters struggling for control in the same world is not unseen. In fact, it's used extremely often. Kyoukai no Kanata is no stranger to this tradition. Touting a common concept and developing from it, Kyoukai takes us on a somewhat unique look towards a familiar yarn - losing some charm in the process.\r\nArt: 10/10\r\nKyoto Animation's animation and art are not to be trifled with. Known for masterful eye-candy such as Free!,Chuunibyou, K-ON and Haruhi, KyoAni has brought us another breathtaking piece of animated wizardry. The story may be overused, but watching this for the art is more than worth it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nAs with KyoAni's god par animation, sound is also extremely well done, captivating your ears for more than just twelve episodes. Not once, not twice, not thrice, but ten times have I attained eargasms. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nMirai is just adorable. There's no doubt about that. Akkey may be your average, sacrificial main character,  but he's nothing compared to Hiroomi and his adorable imouto.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nMost of the time I would watch this show for the animation. The animation, the animation, everything about it rocked my balls off. Once or twice, I got excited about the story, but this was a very enjoyable anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nNot your best monsters vs. humans anime, but the animation, sound, character and raw action take it away. Recommended to anyone who likes anything animated.",

            "content": "\u201c Don't walk behind me; I may not lead. Don't walk in front of me; I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend.\u201d\r\n                            -Albert Camus\r\nIf nothing else, Kyoukai no Kanata was an entertaining anime. It was able to produce tears, surprise, excitement, and many laughs. The coherency of the plot may have been questionable, but nonetheless, the ride that the anime portrayed was over-exceeded any nuances with the direction of the story line.\r\nThe mainissue that I had with KNK was the plot/story line. The first episode of Kyoukai provided substantial expectations about the nature of the plot. You have an immortal main character (Akihito Kanbara), and this mysterious arched four eyed cutie (Mirai Kuriyama) stabbing him in the stomach every chance she gets. You wonder why she is compulsively stabbing Akihito, and you start wonder whether she is some sort of physical sadist. \\n\\n\r\nThe mystery surrounding Mirai is enough to compel watching the next few episodes. Unfortunately, after the first three to four episodes, there is a sense that an integrant factor is missing from this anime. The location of this missing factor can not be exactly pin-pointed, but the direction of the anime did not seem to culminate to any substantive climax. It is like this anime prided in not taking itself seriously, and was being amused by our attempts to do so.  However, in an attempt to reel us back in, the story took an interesting twist by showing us the back story of Mirai. This was probably the highlight of the anime since the episode molded and answered the ambivalent aura of the semi-seriously constructed plot that was been shoved down our pharynx.\\n\\n\r\nThe last few episodes did not leave us with any certainty which is not a necessary requirement for excellence, but the ending did leave a significant amount of abstruse quandaries unanswered. If I assume that there will not be a second season, then this ending, in terms of plot development, was sub par.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of this anime was fantastic. The grandiose colours matched with uniquely drawn characters were enough to have me gaping at some of the scenes. For the most part, the animation was consistently fluid, and the action scenes were marvelously done. Every episode seemed sumptuous and fervent with sound and colour.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of sound, the background music was decent too. I do not believe that KnK has any stick-out-the-page musical piece, but the soundtrack wafted along with the majority of the scenes benignly. What did stand out to me was the ED of the anime, the way that the beginning of the ED innocently guided the final ending scenes of the episode into the first ED scene were done with potent aesthetics. I was amazed by the way Mirai was used in the ED as being alone, and extending her hand in front of her chest, aiming to have someone...anyone grab it back. You see people, supposed friends, just walk past her, giving her no mind. Finally, Akihito comes to her, and does not need to grab her hands, he just smiles at her. She smiles back. Amazingly done, I was not an initial fan of the ED, but it really grew on me after giving it a fair chance.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Kyoukai No Kanata had a tendency to be archetypal and paradigmatic. The variance of their comportment usually did not portray diversity. After a while, you get sick of the glasses fetish jokes given by the Akihito, the incestial jokes of  Hiroomi loses shock value after the second episode, Mitsuki's jokes are uninspired and non-rememberable, and Mirai's unpleasantries showed no bounds of reason. I understand that the anime is restricted to 12 episodes, but at least there should be an attempt to diversify these character's personality instead of the blatant banality of creativity. \\n\\n\r\nThis is not to say that I absolutely disliked the characters. I found Mirai to be rather cute, and charming (in her own way). Her shy but honest ( and I use the term honest loosely) attitude grew on me, and left me wanting to see more of her, minus her annoying \u201cThis is sooo unpleasant\u201d quote. I enjoyed her character design, it is not typical of an anime heroine, and she resembles the girl next door, or the girl sitting next to you in calculus class. \\n\\n\r\nI found Hiroomi to be a comical character, most of my laughs originated from this guy. I just found his nonchalant demeanor to be hilarious, and I laughed at his initial incestial jokes, before they became repetitive and boring. I wanted the story to delve deeper into his background, and there were hints on his past (intertwined with Akihito's past) being shown, but at the end left me wanting. \\n\\n\r\nMitsuki turned out to be the most lacking of the characters. She was the standard paradigmatic witty beautiful arrogant but caring girl. Nothing more, nothing less. Her jokes were useless, let alone funny. Her strength was not substantive, and there episodes at a time where she was MIA....I mean it's like we were expected to not care for this character at all. Mituski existed in this anime in just the capacity that she needed to exist for Hiroomi's jokes to be relevant. Her character design was also non-inspiring. \\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character in KNK is by far Akihito. Despite his turbulent and dark past, Akihito still manages to demonstrate an exuberant comportment, and a fervent fetish towards girl wearing glasses. Though his jokes were hardly funny, I found Akihito's optimism to be inspiring and touching. The moment where he tells Mirai, \u201c I'm just like you....a monster.\u201d was the most powerful moment for me in KNK. Though he suffered an abject past, he continued to make friends, laugh, and even fall in love. His maturity was refreshing for me to experience, and my only drawback is that I wished that he would have been more combat-inclined. There may not be any unique qualities about Akihito, his character type is rampant in modern anime, but that did not decrease my enjoyment of him.\\n\\n\r\n My enjoyment of KNK was in a state of fluctuation between the first half of the anime, but strong near the end. The ambiguity in whether the anime should be taken seriously or as a comedy left me ambivalent about my enjoyment until a decision was made to take the second half seriously. There was a \u201cfiller\u201d episode thrown in there that had me rolling in laughter, but after that episode, the plot became more dark and serious.  Ignoring the nuances of the plot, I would say that this anime was enjoyable and has the capacity to be rewatchable. Overall, I give the anime an 8/10,  and I would recommend KNK to anyone who is looking for a quick watch (that involves comedy, drama, and action) and isn't meticulous about plot details. \\n\\n\r\nRating:\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

            "content": "This is by far one of my favorite (if not my favorite) anime of all time. Why, you ask? Well i'm about to tell you. From the beginning of the story I fell in love, not only with the animation but with the music and the characters and all other aspects of this show. I just thought it was so wonderful, keep in mind that this is my first review ever though, so the quality of it will be who knows how bad or good- and i'm sure that many of you probably disagree and that's okay. Now onto the review:\r\nStory: (8/10) The fact thatnot much is explained until almost the last episode is cool. I see a lot of people complain about that, but the reality is that it's from Akihito's point of view and we get to know just about as much as he does. Al though this is true, some things could have gone further explained- youmu for example. Youmu come from people's jealousy, hatred, and malice, they also range from humanoids to insectoids- that's just about all i got, why do they possess humans? Why can some take on human forms? Why are some good (ex. Ayaka and Ai)? I also would have loved to have seen different encounters with humans that were possessed by youmu, and i feel as if a lot could have been explained about Izumi and the one guy who was trying to let the kyoukai no kanata destroy the world for some reason. Another flaw in the story would have to be going into depth about the character's pasts. In conclusion, they could have gone into more depth about the characters but instead they chose not to. While reading the light novel I found lots of things that seemed crucial to the story that were left out. Other than things not being explained thoroughly enough and the slow-ish pace, I thought the story was great. Although slow-paced, It was very captivating and humorous, the episodes could make me sob one minute and laugh the next. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (10/10) The sound definitely gets a 10/10, i'm the kind of person who will watch the opening and ending once throughout the entire series and then never watch it again. This wasn't the case for this show, I love both the opening and the ending sososo much and haven't skipped it once. Not sure if special effect sounds are included in this, but I saw no flaw in those either. The background music always fit the scene, and the character songs were marvelous. Everything in the musical aspect was great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (1000/10) Geez, this set of characters is by far my favorite ever. I am super picky with characters, honestly most of the time I really don't necessarily favor any of the characters in a show or anime that I watch. There were no two characters that were two much a like, they all stood out in their own little ways. Whether you're looking for a funny, over-dramatic, cute, pervert character or a masochistic, emotionless, yet very funny character you're going to find it and everything in between. Mirai and Akihito's relationship was honestly perfect to me. I hate stories that overly focus on the romance aspect and spend too much time dwelling on it, in this story you get to see them slowly fall for each other, which I find to be the cutest thing. I love love love the occasional cute moments and act of affection that have actual motives, which is what I found here. Since it doesn't explain the characters in much detail, you get to learn about them yourself. You get to see them grow confident in themselves, fight different battles, and interact with others. For a show with a measly 12 episodes I thought the character development and character's in general were pretty great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10) This is quite obvious. The mere fact that I am taking my time to write this review after sleeping for about an hour last night and continuing to not sleep just so I could watch the show, shows that the enjoyment level was high up in my eyes. I take lots and lots of time to finish an anime, especially if i'm not too interested in it. I definitely wouldn't have to look forward to watching it every week the minute it comes out (even if that means doing it in class) if the enjoyment level wasn't a 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this anime a 10, with the only weak point being the story (or how they portray the story in the anime, i should say) this anime deserves a 10. I hope this review is helpful for whatever reason and I hope there are others who can find as much joy in this show as I can. Thank you for reading.\\n",

            "content": "I never knew there was a fetish for girls who wears glasses until I watched this anime.  Now I realize I enjoy it when some girls wear their glasses?  Warning, you may become a megane freak from this anime.  Oh and you may get a Japanese lesson from this series as well... how unfortunate.  \r\nStory: 7\r\nIn what seems to be a normal world is actually inhabited by supernatural creatures (Different subs use different names for these supernatural creatures) and people with supernatural powers.  Our main character is half human and half creature as well as a person with a fetishfor glasses.  The story follows his journey to help Mirai, a girl from a cursed clan and has the ability to manipulate her own blood, fight these supernatural creatures.  \\n\\n\r\nThe ending felt very forced and unnatural.  The ending seemed to just be there to make the viewer of the show happy, but the way they did it felt so forced in.  \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing was fine, it felt a bit rushed towards the end.  They may have been able to remove some fillers as well and spaced it out a bit better... but the fillers were enjoyable as well.  \\n\\n\r\nI do wish they answered more questions instead of introducing more, as at the end of the series, there were so many things I wanted to ask but I knew that these questions were purposely left there to let the viewers think.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nKyoto Animation is known for their great animation and scenery.  There work on Kyoukai no Kanata is no exception.  Many times throughout the series was I in wonder and awe because of how amazing the animation was.  Every movement of the characters were smooth.  \\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes in the anime are better than most.  Most action themed anime series lose details in the background and animation of the fight scene are never as smooth as scenes outside an action scene.  Kyoto Animation did an excellent job with their action scenes, as they used transitions during the right times, as well as keeping the background as detailed as it was during normal scenes.  They even did rapid still frames during the action scenes and it still looked smooth.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I had were some character designs, aside from Mirai, Hi'romi and Akhito, the designs for the characters weren't too amazing.  Mitsuki and Aoi look like normal background characters and weren't given a design that allowed them to stand out, such as glasses, a scarf or a vest.  This is just a small problem though, as the characters are still memorable outside of their design.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nKyoukai no Kanata by Minori Chihara, the self-named OP for the series is a great way to start every episode.  Starts off very calm but leads to an exciting verse and chorus, it is very similar to how the series progresses.  The series starts off warm and calm, but escalates in action.  My favorite thing about this entire series, is the ED, Daisy by STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION.  Nothing sounds as good as the actual series transitions into the ED through the sound.  Typically used toward the last episodes of most series, Kyoukai no Kanata uses this transition into the ED frequently and is very enjoyable.  The song itself is a very good song.\\n\\n\r\nIf you aren't aware, since the internet blew up when the episode aired... Kyoukai no Kanata has a filler episode that has an idol theme to it.  The insert song used for that episode, Yakusoku no Kizun, is pretty much an idol song... but is still enjoyable.  \\n\\n\r\nThe background music was great as well, matched the mood, no problems.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThe characters were very good.  They all are memorable as the story gives enough depths and back story to each character to make them memorable... except one.  The one character I wished we had more background information and possible history was the antagonist... Fujima.  (I had to look up his name since he wasn't that memorable at all..)  He is a character that is shown to be a normal villain, but with no depth making him easy to forget.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only three characters that developed were Akhito, Mirai and Mitsuki.  I would say the only two that needed development were Akhito and Mirai as Mitsuki opening up to her brother is a minor development.  Akhito and Mirai's character development was quite a ride and very enjoyable as they developed around each other, much like a romance.  Watching this development was a highlight for this series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nMuch as everyone has said about this anime, the series has a strong start but gets a bit rough at the ending.  I argue that it gets rough around the last two episodes, others argue it gets rough earlier.  I did have a higher expectation for this series, but it only fell a little short story-wise, but the sound and art made up for the rough ending.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nWhat would be nice would be a special for what happened after the ending or a movie and knowing Kyoto Animation, one of these is going to happen.  A chance for a sequel?  The way the series ended, and with the questions left, there could be a sequel... but the ending has enough closure to completely end the series where it is.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "It surprises me to see the mixed reaction to Kyoukai no Kanata. Some love it, even considering it as their favourite anime ever, yet some dropped it quick and didn't like it at all. I'm neither of these. I don't hate it, yet don't considering it a masterpiece. I just really liked it. Here's why.\r\nNow, as a story, Kyoukai no Kanata goes completely unanswered until the last episode. You are quite frankly left wondering many things, and a lot of \"whys\" float in your head. However this isn't the worst thing that could possibly happen. It's supposed to be a dark fantasy anime. Perhaps it'sright that there is a lot of mystery involved. That's good. For most it keeps you watching. Yet for some that might not be the case. In terms of a story, if you don't like getting confused or waiting for the resolution (basically the last episode), don't watch Kyoukai no Kanata. The stories darkness and mystery is a fundamental aspect of everything you watch, so I believe if you have patience, you'll love it.\\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation did a great job on Kyoukai no Kanata. Simple as that. They captured the essence of story, the emotions, the feelings of the characters with the animation. The Youmu in particular as well as the fight scenes are great to watch. I say good job Kyoto animation. Characters voices are very much suitable to the sorts of characters, and is very much helpful in allowing you to feel the way they do. The music for me wasn't the most amazing thing to my ears, but it certainly wasn't bad at all.\\n\\n\r\nNow, for the characters as they are, can be considered good. There is a lot of focus on the identity of each character, and their specific traits. However that's about as far as it goes. I can share my criticism with others in that there is little depth to the characters. Don't get me wrong the characters are brilliant and suit Kyoukai no Kanata to a T. I feel that sometimes the misplaced comedy and sexual gags get in the way of some potentially great dialogue or charade development. It certainly doesn't drag anything down, it's more of a personal suggestion that there be more stories behind the characters. But you can only do so much in 12 episodes so I do understand why it was made how it was.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, I can really say I enjoyed it. I would have rated Kyoukai no Kanata an 8 an hour ago. However on watching the final episode it did step up the mark to a 9. Some might disagree with me on this rating, seeing as most feel the lack of a fluidic story and decently developed characters ruin it. However I do see Kyoukai no Kanatas purpose. As a fantasy darkness anime, you cannot be certain on anything. Just about anything could have been done for the final episode, and the way it was ended was great. I believe you should watch it. Test your patience, and then watch the final episode. Then you'll understand why Kyoukai no Kanata actually goes beyond the boundary (Haha) in its genre. \\n\\n\r\n9/10.\\n",

            "content": "Although I am sure that many people will disagree with my review here it is. After having watched all episodes of Kyoukai no Kanata I can safely state that this anime has gone on my top 10 worst anime. \r\nAllow me to explain why. Even though it showed a promising start it quickly revealed its true nature. At the best moment I could claim it to be mediocre. The only thing that was always exceptional was the art. Other than that the story was lacking if not outright non-existent. The term plot-hole does not begin to describe this anime. A more appropriate term would havebeen a black hole since you have no idea why anything happens.\\n\\n\r\nThe ost was mediocre. Nothing really bad but also nothing that would get you excited as well. Its one of those osts you forget the minute you hear it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters were filled with potential but no real effort was made to properly introduce them to the viewers. Yes I know that it only had 12 episodes but even so the character development was exceptionally bad. As the story progressed I started disliking certain characters I found quite interesting in the first episode simply because their actions and decisions made no sense at all.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary the plot was bad, the character development was bad, the ost was mediocre and the art was good. Overall, for me at least, this combination makes a very bad anime that not only I would not suggest to anyone but an anime that I would actively try make it disappear from the face of the anime world.",

            "content": "I'd rate this somewhere between 6 and 7 out of 10. For the purpose of critiquing, I'm putting it at a 6, but (for now) in my own list, I've rated it 7. I've done my best not to give spoilers, so at times it may feel vague, but I've revealed my concerns.\nWhile Kyoto Animation has always handled its art and animation amazingly well, taking 2D frame animation and its characters towards a more realistic depiction, with much fluidity, pacing, and expressive body and facial language, it feels as if they're falling into the trap of exhibitionism. I'd watch them any time for aesthetic service.But, it's the fanservice they forcefully put in that bothers me. It takes the story away from itself, away from its genre, away from its characters that could have otherwise been strong. Kyoukai no Kanata held a lot of potential, both character as well as concept-wise, but in the end, it felt like your mind was toyed with and taken for granted.\\n\\n\nStory 7/10:\\n\nSupernatural beings, fighting to save the world, relationships... all said and seen. \\n\nThe first episode starts off with an awkward saviour-confession by Akihito Kanbara, who is just then stabbed by Mirai Kuriyama. Like, okay... odd.  But interesting. AND character-defining. \\n\nWe soon follow up with the supernatural setting, an introduction to other characters whose relationship is not immediately clear, but we then slip into a mode of acceptance as page by page, the sequences slowly reveal us the nature of the plot. It feels like a game world. Probably conceived with such intentions too that it may be developed into a game (have not read the light novel by Nagomu Torii, supported by Chise Kamoi's artwork). \\n\nIt seems simple enough - living, killing, earning - until somewhere midway, we are introduced to stronger youmu they have to fight off, and then we learn about the existence of \"Kyoukai no Kanata\" and its sense in that world, and the complexity it entails. \\n\nThen of course, to add some comedy and spice, there are those blush moments. Thankfully, it's not too cheesy, but it does feel forced at certain points. It's just the fanservice that ruins it all. \\n\nI would say that the concepts are strong. But the adaptation juxtaposed with the characters, makes the ink bleed all over.\\n\\n\nArt 10/10:\\n\nWhat more can I say? I'd watch KyoAni's animation any time for its pure eye romance. The colours and forms are beautiful. The character motions are fluid, action sequences are full (you might see GIFs popping up a lot now), and even if incomplete, they give a sense of awesomeness. The art direction is beautiful, has subtleties, and does not stagnate. The eyes have something to see always. The landscapes are gorgeous, and we see demons in new shapes and forms. They've experimented, with and away. The visuals at the end show the creativity. \\n\\n\nSound 10/10:\\n\nUsually the sounds for me are a little hard to get by, not because I'm so drowned into a sequence I don't hear it (okay, that does happen) but more because of the way I follow subtitles, and especially series that are full of dialogues. I keep pause-playing. So although my experience as such has been choppy, there were times when i went back to a sequence just to hear the soundtrack. It's well done, and though I watch low quality, I can say that the sounds and the sound tracks are rich. (I remember liking Tonari no Kaibutsu-kun's sounds similarly well). Even the OP and ED are really well done - the tune is stuck to my head, and I find myself slipping into it on my metro journeys through the day. \\n\\n\nCharacter 6/10:\\n\nLike... uhh... whaaaaat??? Like... really... whaaaaat?\\n\nConsidering the character-defining moment that we see during the first moments of the first episode, the subsequent development just makes you wonder whether you're supposed to be watching slice-of-life, rom-com, or if these characters really were supposed to hold that much depth that they claim to make through the show which has a dark complex plotline. You hear them make claims about themselves, you hear them talk about and trying to confront their pasts and scars, but the next moment you see them fanservicing you with photoshots of cosplay outfits, and that one mid-point HIDEOUS episode of wtf-idol-singing-to-a-youmu(??!!??!!??!!!!!!??!). Like... uhhh... whaaaat the hell just happened??\\n\nIt's SOO convenient. SOO played over by the industry. And Akihito's mother is an amazing stereotypical wtf-character who not only embarrasses the characters within the show but it embarrasses the show itself and KyoAni's attempts. Even if you're introducing such weird characters, I feel that there's a way that it can be handled without losing integrity, without falling into the trap of usual fanservice otaku culture. It creates a disjuncture with the plot. It disturbs the mind. It makes the complexity of the sinister plot look pathetic. To me, it is NOT at all entertainment. \\n\nHiroomi's hands on Akihito's waist and his sister-complex were fine, even Akihito's perversion, I don't mind, since he IS in that puberty age. But the duality by held especially Mirai and Akihito, did not hold together. At one point, you wonder if it's okay since they ARE supposed to be kids. I can also agree that a dark character will also find time to goof around and feel light. I'm not saying it's not possible to escape your past and really enjoy the little things of the present, but then the depiction of those characters have to be able to bear that personality. Here, it just shatters it and makes them look cheesy and artificial - waaaay behind the realistic adaptation that KyoAni seeks in its animation. It's trying to combine the mental ages of 6 and 40. \\n\nI'm sick of maid outfits and cat costumes. Move ON people. The comedy elements were really forced. \\n\nBy the end of the show, there is so much depth to especially the two main characters, and you see them mature, but when you look back, you wonder where it came from. how all of that could lead them to harbour those emotions. It feels like a facade. It was rushed. It was awkward. \\n\nA good example of duality would be Watamote, which had a wonderful character who was able to handle the duality and the complexity of her personality and the conflicting emotions. Mirai and Akihito felt like wannabe-brood-stories. I'm not asking for a binary cut, but the distance between their pain and pleasures shouldn't be soooo wide. It's just hard to digest and relate to. \\n\nApart from them, the rest of the characters were the flat-type. They felt singular and more true to their tropes, which gelled better with the main genre of the show. I'd say the depiction of Sakura and Izumi held their characters much much better. However, we are left with a lot of unanswered questions with the claim of the matters being carpeted. The reasons for the climax, the character dialogues and revelations and secrecy at the end, felt more like a cover-up of failures. It's hard to see what a second season can do.. whether it can really progress because it feels like it would just be a drawl. \\n\\n\nEnjoyment 7/10:\\n\nFor a large portion, I was ignoring the fanservice. My only sources of enjoyment were the art, the OSTs and the concept and its visualisation. \\n\\n\nOverall 6/10:\\n\nIt irks me what this show could have been. I'm imagining Death Note and Darker Than Black, even Guilty Crown. Though none are KyoAni, but they could have looked into the genre. They've tried fusing kiddy slice of life with dark supernatural and it fell apart, for me atleast. I wouldn't even call it slice of life. There was nothing like that here. \\n\\n\nRecommendation to others:\\n\nYou can definitely pick it up. It's worthwhile to note the possibilities of stories, and its visualisation, and even certain character quirks despite how it failed here. Pick it up for some eye candy. But keep your distance. I'll say that the ending is really a yo-yo they play with your head and heart, so you'll feel like wtf there, but I guess it's not that bad a try. Failures should also be noted. KyoAni tried something new, good for them. I hope they learn and make better decisions.",

A \"dark fantasy\" led by the director Ishidate Taichi and animated by one of the best companies, at least animation-wise. But they tend to make mistakes in the end, and they did, or not... I'll try to explain.\r\nThe ending was amazing, if KnK had been a 2-cour serie, or a movie. Somehow, they tried to wrap things like there is no tomorrow (well, there is no tomorrow), and failed, specially with theinter-characters development. Mirai loves Akkey and vice-versa, but it completely lacks the drama that good animes have like: If you're  going to keep your feelings to yourself until the bitter end, then finish with a bang!!!. Sometimes the story simply lost itself, if the arcs had been made as separate OVA's, it would not change anything, since that they didn't need each other to keep the story moving (except the first and the last one, I mean, characters have to be introduced somehow). But even if there was no link between the arcs, it was quite fun to watch, the characters were fun, the animation was really well done, the songs were amazing (another \"thumbs up\" for Kyoani - they sure know how to insert songs in the middle of the show -). I enjoyed a lot, but I was expecting a lot more, given the staff that made it. \\n\r\nFinally, I had great fun watching it, and I hope for a 2nd season, since the plot had so many holes in it.",

It's ok. BUT this is not it's best trait: The way they are able to convey the character's emotions and feelings to the viewer in many ways got me attached. Some episodesmight be considered fillers, but in some way contributes to the plot and character development, this also helped the characters to have a stronger bond than most anime. The plot begins to become deep towards episode 11, and by the end of 12, you'd be asking what was going on. This causes you to be pulled in and also makes you want to watch the movie. (Spoiler) Mirai loses her memory and makes my feelings crumble, and Akihito just wants her to lead a normal life so he puts aside his past feelings for her in which makes me all the more interested. However, if slow-paced anime are a turn-off for you, you might not want to watch this.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kyoukai no Kanata/Beyond the Boundary was one of my first animes (my fifth to be precise), so I'm probably a bit biased, but here I go anyway.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe show starts off in an unexpected way: A girl backflipping over a fence and stabbing our male lead in the heart. Extremely surprising, to say the least. However, he isn't dead. Akihito Kanbara is immortal so needless to say, being stabbed in the chest doesn't kill him.\r\nAnd here we are introduced to our two main characters. We have Mirai, shunned due to her blood manipulation powers, and Akihito, existing as an immortal half-youmu.\r\nSo what's a youmu? Similarto Madoka Magica's concept of witches and Noragami's Phantoms, youmu are born out of the ill wishes and curses of people. Spirit World Warriors, of which Mirai is a part, make a living off of hunting them down. Since this isn't the first show to do this, it's not an original concept, but at least in this show if you're a good warrior you can make a lot of money killing these things (whereas in Madoka Magica and Noragami it's more of a charity duty; I know I'm skimming over details, but here is not the place to explain the plots of other shows).\\n\r\nHowever, Mirai dislikes drawing attention to her abnormal powers (I mean, she uses a sword made out of her own hardened blood. How badass is that?), so while she is a powerful Spirit World Warrior, she lacks experience and is pretty poor too, buying discounted food and struggling to make each month's rent.\\n\r\nAnyway, the story takes a while to get its feet under itself. We bounce around from arc to arc, each segment taking only a couple of episodes apiece, and finally in the last few episodes, we move to our main plot. I think there's two potential areas of improvement here:\\n\r\n1. Making the show longer, so to have each arc give us maximum impact (the Hollow Shadow arc? Ouch).\\n\r\n2. If there was no way to make the show longer, keeping the story focused on its central plot would have kept us from being detracted into side stories (like episode 6) and made the story more cohesive from start to finish. \\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I liked all the little mini-arcs. But that led to the main plot feeling rushed and squeezed in at the last minute. I would have liked it to be more drawn-out.\\n\r\nWe also have the enigma that is episode 6. I'm still not entirely sure what happened in development to lead to that. Still, it's an amusing episode to say the least.\\n\r\nBasically, some youmu that's worth a crazy amount appears on the top of the kids' school rooftop. They try to kill it, but that fails and they have to regroup. Long story short, their overly elaborate plot doesn't work, and the youmu gets away.\\n\r\nThe stink that the youmu sprays on them apparently doesn't go away until they defeat it, and since they never do, I suppose the characters just smell really bad for the rest of the show. It's a weird little plot hole, but I enjoyed the episode and the insert song, so whatever.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 6 serves as a nice break before we start moving back into dark fantasy, though this time it gets darker than it did before.\\n\r\nWe also move into the main plot, which is somewhat confusing in terms of worldbuilding and leaves you to figure out stuff for yourself. It's weak on the technical side, but everything besides that is better in my opinion.\\n\r\nThe ending of the show is controversial, since a lot of people say it was a cop-out and a gaping plot hole. The plot hole part may be true, but as someone who watched the show as it was airing, I can say that I was hoping above all else for that particular ending so I didn't mind when they gave it to us.\\n\r\nAlso, we're getting a sequel movie pretty soon so I'm assuming we're at least going to get an explanation for this ending.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the plot isn't super original and it takes a while for the main story to get itself up and going, but I still liked the ideas the show presented, even if it didn't execute them all that well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThis show is done by Kyoto Animation, who normally does drama/slice of life/romance anime, so it's interesting to see them experiment with \"dark fantasy,\" which is what Kyoukai no Kanata is.\\n\r\nThe fighting animation is very fluid and nice-looking, and always a pleasure to watch. I didn't like it when I first watched the show, but rewatching it I think my past self was crazy. I also think the reason I didn't like it is because the fight animation only lasts a couple of seconds or less between cuts. So it's a bit jarring, especially after I was used to animes with drawn-out shots of action scenes. However, in between the cuts, the movement is very nice. There's also a lot of small details, from the dust that Mirai kicks up with her legs to the bubbles floating in her sword to the colorful sparks thrown up whenever weapons clash. The Cages made by Spirit World Warriors to contain a certain area also contain lots of colors and look very nice.\\n\r\nBackgrounds are a given. Gorgeous, as can be expected of Kyoani. Especially in the opening scene, a sunset from a rooftop, they are detailed and colorful and very nice to look at.\\n\r\nOne thing that stuck out to me when I first watched the show, and one that I continued to notice rewatching it, is that they don't use the same shot for very long before switching. Live-action shows cut camera every time a character speaks, and this show does the same. I think that's because Kyoani has a lot of money and can afford to draw new shots for every second of the show.\\n\r\nReally, the only complaint I have is that sometimes during fights, and at some other seemingly random times, there'd be a lack of shading on the characters. I'm not sure what was up with that, but it was kind of distracting to move from the beautiful lighting and shading to a lack thereof.\\n\r\nThe other complaint I have is the two-second shot of Akihito in the ED. The way he's drawn is reminiscent of the train wreck that is episode 9 of Mekakucity Actors. I'm not sure what possessed Kyoani to draw him that way. If you've seen the show, you may remember what I'm talking about.\\n\r\nAside from that, both the OP and ED have outstanding animation. The OP has gorgeous backgrounds with amazing lighting and raindrops on a window that look realistic, as well as characters fighting and twirling weapons. The ED features textures and colors abound, as well as a lot of symbolism. The characters don't move around much (most of the ED is Mirai with her arm outstretched), but the backgrounds and other details are what make it truly special.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening of this show, \"Beyond the Boundary,\" (not the most original title, but whatever) is sung by the voice actor of one of the main characters. The song's beginning and ending are kind of mellow, but the middle part is fast-paced and awesome. It's a good opening all around.\\n\r\nThe ending song is called \"Daisy,\" performed by Stereo Dive Foundation. It's also a pretty mellow song, but a very good one. I also love the \"I never say goodbye\" at the end of it, since I think that especially suits the show.\\n\r\nAs far as OST, I really like the soundtrack of this show. It's kind of creepy and spooky, but appropriately bubbly and upbeat during the happier moments. One issue I do have is that they'd often recycle pieces too much. One time, they even finished playing one song and then just started it right over again (and I noticed this because I happen to have this song on my iPod, so I hear it a lot). I have no idea how many songs are in the total soundtrack, but I did notice the lack of variety.\\n\r\nAnd the insert song performed in episode 6, Future Star, is just as the characters describe it: sickly sweet but actually pretty catchy. It's a cute song.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has no dub, and I'm kind of glad since if it did get one it'd likely be an ADV dub and I dislike ADV dubs. \\n\r\nThe Japanese cast does a fine job with voices and voice acting. I also found it surprising how Mirai's voice actor, Risa Taneda, voices Saki in Shinsekai Yori since the two sound almost nothing alike. Mirai has a very cute and high-pitched voice, but despite her voice, she portrays the proper negative emotions when it's needed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nWhat a strange misfit cast of dorks we have in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThere's Mirai Kuriyama, our protagonist. She's the moe cuteness obligatory in every Kyoani work. Glasses, skinny body, fluffy hair, high voice, the works. She has the catchphrase \"How unpleasant!\" which she utters whenever possible. But despite all the cuteness, Mirai is isolated due to her strange powers, and is unwilling to interact with others in the beginning. She also confesses early on that she has killed a person with her own two hands. That's a pretty shocking statement coming from someone like her, who hates killing youmu because of the thought of death.\\n\r\nMirai is also apparently pretty clumsy, tripping over everything in the first episode, but despite her clumsiness, she is able to perform complicated aerial maneuvers (like backflipping over her school's fence) and fight confidently with her blood sword. It's somewhat contradictory.\\n\r\nAnd on that note, there's a lot of defying physics in this show without a reason why. But whatever, since a lot of animes defy physics without bothering to explain why.\\n\\n\r\nNext we have Akihito Kanbara, our male lead. As explained, he's half-youmu, and has a powerful youmu consciousness inside his body, though luckily his human mind is in control most of the time. However, when Akihito's life is in peril, the youmu inside him awakes, and he develops a nasty tendency to attack everything around him.\\n\r\nDespite the fact that Mirai kicks off the show by trying to kill him over and over again, Akihito is sympathetic toward her and helps her hunt down youmu, buys her food, and even offers to help cover her rent. He's a pretty sweet guy to be so nice to someone who tried to kill him, but that's just his nature I guess.\\n\r\nWe do meet his mother a couple of times, but she's pretty irrelevant and mostly fanservice. I would like to know about his father though, since they don't mention him once in the show. Same for the rest of the parents in this show, actually. We know nothing of Mirai's family or anyone else's.\\n\r\nThe one thing I dislike about Akihito's character is his over-the-top glasses fetish. As someone who wears glasses, it made me happy to hear him talking about how pretty girls with glasses are, but his obsession with them borders on unrealistic. He's constantly trying to get the other characters in glasses and he has a weird obsession with Mirai since she wears glasses. Yes, those two are cute, but I think we could do without the fetishes. You can write a cute relationship without one of them obsessing over the other's accessories.\\n\\n\r\nThe other two main characters are Mitsuki and Hiromi Nase, siblings from the rich Nase family of Spirit World Warriors. Mitsuki is pretty apathetic most of the time, eating lollipops and calling the guys perverts. She's a Spirit World Warrior who specializes in Cages and has a catlike youmu as a pet. She also refuses to go along with her older brother's strange requests.\\n\r\nWhich brings us to Hiromi. His fetish makes Akihito's look almost normal by comparison: He has a little sister complex, and is constantly trying to get Mitsuki to call him \"Onii-chan,\" which she purposely avoids. I'm not sure why Japan loves incestual relationships so much, but there you have it.\\n\r\nTo be honest, Hiromi's character would actually be pretty interesting if he wasn't constantly exclaiming how pretty his little sister is. He fights with the scarf he always wears, is a pro at Cages, and has an interesting history with Akihito. But alas, he's pretty much no more than a fetish creep.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as minor characters, we have Sakura Inami who I've heard is an anime-only character, but I'm not sure about that. She starts out with a personal vendetta against Mirai for spoilery reasons, but pulls the quickest 180 I've ever seen in a character.\\n\r\nThere's also Mitsuki and Hiromi's older sister, Izumi Nase. She's got an interesting plot twist in the last episodes but it's unfortunately never capitalized on. Maybe we can get some more info in the sequel movie, but who knows.\\n\r\nThen there's Miroku, who in some ways is the villan of this story, but he's mostly just an interfering asshole.\\n\r\nThere's several other minor characters, but none of them are relevant to the story to be honest. They're mostly just there and don't really have any outstanding characteristics.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nAs I mentioned, I watched this series back when it was airing. My friends and I had some pretty amusing predictions in hindsight, and there was a lot of yelling and crying whenever a new episode would come out (I'm talking the last few episodes, by the way). The light novels are not fully translated, so we were all at a loss for what would happen next.\\n\r\nSo yeah, as someone who watched this and had no idea what would happen next, my enjoyment of this show was quite high. Even rewatching it, when I noticed a lot of problems, I still finished my rewatch in two days and enjoyed every minute of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nIt's not the best show out there, but it has great audiovisuals and a pretty interesting cast of characters despite their shortcomings and fetishes. The story is pretty good too, but I wish it'd gotten to its point sooner.\\n\\n\r\nI think this show is a must-watch, especially for those fond of Kyoani's usual works, to see how different this one is. Though it contains slice of life elements, it's a far cry from their typical works and shows how heartbreaking and ruthless Kyoani can be (That movie preview? Brutal). And if you just like a plain old action anime, that fulfills this desire too, since there's really pretty fighting animation and some interesting concepts, even if said concepts don't get fully capitalized on.",

            "content": "*to those who are too lazy to read and just want a quick summary, skip to the final paragraph*\r\nKyoAni has always been famous for its heart-wrenching and tear-jerking series. Stuff like Clannad, Air, and Kanon has been the stuff of legends among anime enthusiasts and otaku alike when the subject of romatic dramas come to mind. But then comes along Kyoukai no Kanata, an anime that is something seemingly focused on fast-paced action and adrenaline-inducing fight scenes. So seeing KyoAni\u2019s repertoire with anime, it becomes quite obvious that Kyoukai no Kanata is something that is somewhat new to them, like something akin to anexperiment. With their decision to do this, it became pretty clear that KyoAni are trying to expand their horizons, so now only one question remains: did they manage pull it off?\\n\\n\r\nTechnically speaking, KyoAni has done quite a few of action scenes in the past with an anime called Chuunibyou, so needless to say, they had the animation aspect down. But then again, KyoAni has been quite famous for making quite a lot of high-quality works, so that much is a given, although there are those instances where the mouth doesn\u2019t sync properly with the voice of the character, but it\u2019s nothing too serious. The same can also said for the opening and ending sequences. The opening, which is also named Kyoukai no Kanata after the title itself, was a J-pop song sung by by Minori Chihara, is quite fitting to the anime. An upbeat song which sets the mood quite well for the ensuing action. And on the plus side, the actual scenes in the opening itself also doesn\u2019t reveal anything about the plot at all, which is nice. The ending, named Daisy, is more of an electric kind-of song which was made by STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION. To be frank, I have no other words to describe this song other than that it is just awesome. It\u2019s one of those songs that are so damn catchy that you\u2019ll want to listen to it until you hate it.\\n\\n\r\nNow, there\u2019s only one thing that I can complain about art in this anime, and that is the obvious lack of inspiration when it came to the character designs. Seriously, how bland can you make a character look? The male lead, Akihito, looks like a background character from Baccano, the female lead, Mirai\u2019s only memorable feature is her glasses, and only because Akihito mentions it every single episode because of his glasses fetish, while the other characters look like they were taken out of a \u201ccookie-cutter guide to making anime characters\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, one of the problems of Kyoukai no Kanata are the character\u2019s characters themselves. If I were to put it in one word, I would say that they were all boring. The main male lead is a high school student with a glasses fetish and the female lead is a childish and perpetually flustered girl who just has to end every sentiment with \u201cFuyukai Desu~ \u201d. Now add to that the main supporting male who has an Imouto fetish and his sister who is a classical tsundere, and you have the most lackluster and uninspired cast of characters to ever appear in a KyoAni work.\\n\\n\r\nNow, that would\u2019ve all been fine if it just starts out that way, but then they each develop into their own unique characters, but unfortunately no. That doesn\u2019t happen. Well, is sorta does but it just doesn\u2019t\u2026 feel right. You see, the character development of Kyoukai no Kanata is somewhat romance-driven more than it is plot-driven. It\u2019s the kind of development akin to that of Kamina and Simon, where a brief dialogue between characters is what triggers changes in the characters. But the thing is, even when such developments happen, and you know that it happened, you just don\u2019t feel the development. Let me give an example: Main heroine Mirai goes through a horrible experience with Main male lead Akihito. However, as soon as said experience is over, the way Mirai talks, walks, her actions, and her way of thinking are virtually unchanged. You know she\u2019s different from before, but due to KyoAni\u2019s insistence that the show should be Moe, her actions, way of thinking and talking are made to look as if none of the crap she\u2019s been through happened. In fact, it wasn\u2019t until 2 or 3 episodes before the ending of the anime itself until we saw the actual effects of the developments on the characters, which was damn disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the plot, well it was pretty much one of the biggest disappointments of this anime. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s not that it\u2019s bad or horrible. Quite the contrary actually. The plot of the anime was as complex as any decent anime out there, and to be perfectly honest, the plot was actually effective enough to give Kyoukai no Kanata a bit of much needed suspense. However, what bogged down Kyoukai no Kanata\u2019s plot was the presence of innumerable plot holes. And when I say innumerable, I do mean swiss-cheese-plotholes innumerable. The plot left far too many questions to be asked but barely even answered half of them. Add to that an ending that literally left my jaw hanging not because of how good it was, but because of how, for the lack of a better term, fucking stupid and illogical it was.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said though, I do believe that there is but one single culprit with regards as to why Kyoukai no Kanata turned out the way it did, and that is the length of the series. When I finish watching Kyoukai no Kanata, the very first question I asked was: Why wasn\u2019t it longer? Seeing how intricate and the amount of potential the story had, it was so obvious that 12 episodes wouldn\u2019t cut it. It was a story that probably could\u2019ve shown its full potential had it been around 24 episodes, but due to unknown reasons, whether it be the budget or whatever, KyoAni decided that it should be a 12 episode anime. A shame really, as anyone with a good knack for seeing a decent story would be able to tell that Kyoukai no Kanata has a very promising plot and a beautiful concept. However with the way it was presented and the numerous plotholes it created, it became nothing but a bundle of potential that never managed to develop.\\n\\n\r\nKyoukai no Kanata was an anime that could\u2019ve been so much more. It had the makings of a great anime actually, with the perfect premises and concept to become a modern epic. However, due to the fact that it only lasted for 12 episodes, it wasn\u2019t able to use its full potential. And for that, I give it a score of 7; It\u2019s an average anime. Watch it if you feel like you don\u2019t have anything better to watch. Despite being imperfect, it is still interesting enough for the average anime fan to enjoy, especially if you\u2019re a moe fan.\\n\\n\r\nSo to provide a quick summary of the pros and cons:\\n\r\n+Animation is beautiful. Smooth, clean, and overall very well done. As expected from KyoAni.\\n\r\n+Soundtrack is marvelous. The OP is good ol' J-pop. The ED is a bit on the side of electric music. Both are energetic pieces that suit the anime well\\n\\n\\n\r\n-There are times when the mouth doesn't sync properly with the voice;happens when shouting.\\n\r\n-The character designs were a bit uninspired. Too plain, and definitely not something that sticks out.\\n\r\n-The anime is too short. As good as the premise, concept, and plot is, the fact that they tried to cram everything into a 13 or-so episodes made the story suffer greatly.\\n\r\n-Even though the anime was short already as it is, KyoAni still added a damn filler episode.\\n\\n\r\n~First and foremost, thanks for reading my review.

            "content": "Kyoukai no Kanata, or Beyond the Boundary, is an action-packed series animated by the well renowned Kyoto Animation. Adapted from the light novel, the anime was made not to disappoint. However, its execution was not the most successful one.\r\nSTORY (6)\r\nThis is probably every action fantasy lover's dream come true. I has pretty much everything: blood manipulation, immortal half-demons, exorcists, secret organizations, you name it. A dark fantasy series, we follow a group of students who aren't actually human as they battle youmu (literal term being dream demon) and protect the people of the town. As the story progresses, the plot thickens and these youmu andother exorcists wreak havoc in the the world of humans. Secrets are revealed, and each character must decide their own fate. Because it is an action fantasy lover's dream come true, most plot twists aren't surprising. Built upon cliches, the story is admittedly interesting but unfortunately predictable.\\n\\n\r\nART (9)\\n\r\nThe highlight of the Kyoukai no Kanata series. Because it was animated by KyoAni, it was not surprising to see well-made graphics and the fluid motions of the fights scenes. Lots of care was taken for the backgrounds, and many particles were seen throughout whether it be smoke, snow, rain, light, crystal, blood, or shadow. Very clear facial expressions, there is not much to be disappointed about the animations.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (7)\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say about the sound. Though distinguishable, there aren't any noteworthy soundtrack songs. Voice acting quality of course was nothing special and the opening and ending songs were soothing but typical. Though I must admit, the insert song the cast sang at the end of episode 6 was very catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (6)\\n\r\nTaking one look at any of the characters, you know it was animated by KyoAni. But ignoring the trademark KyoAni base character designs, we have a glasses girl who can manipulate poisonous blood and an immortal senpai who loves glasses girls as the protagonists of the series. What stood out to me the most were the Nase siblings. I enjoyed both of the characters' personalities greatly, and to be honest, I probably would have enjoyed this series more if they were taking the main roles in the series.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (6)\\n\r\nBefore the start of the anime series, I thought it was going to be a solid series. I mean, even though the studio was over-hyped, Kyoto Animation was animating a battle fantasy series. From watching Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai, I was expecting amazing battle scenes. And that's what I got: amazing battle scenes. However, everything else was nothing special in my eyes. I did think the series itself was interesting, but I wasn't as engaged with it as much as I would like. Like Mirai would say: \"fuyukai desu.\" How unpleasant.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (7)\\n\r\nI admit, this series will be memorable. Not so much because it was the best anime of 2013, but because that's what the series was made for. It's an okay series, not the best but not the worst. However, like series such as Guilty Crown, I felt as if this series could have been executed much better. Overall, if you got some time, I would recommend watching this action-packed series. But if you got other things to do, there is no hurry to watch Kyoukai no Kanata.",

            "content": "This anime is a prime example of how far excellent music can take a mediocre or even boring story. It also has nice animation but music is by far its strongest aspect by a very clear margin. The show is also a prime example of how not to use pointless filler and how a boring and directionless first half of a show can hamper a not-that-bad second half greatly. It has weak characters, quite stale humor, nice animation and excellent music and a story that could have been told in may be 6-8 episodes dragged into 12 episodes of chaos. But as a whole themusic alone makes it a have a nice aftertaste somehow.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts as protagonist Akihito Kanbara notices a girl seeming to trying to commit suicide and runs to save her, the girl is Mirai Kuriyama who is a spirit world hunter hunting for youmu, as a matter of fact our hero turns out to be an immortal half youmu and the interaction of these two and their school life turns out to be the setting of the story. The story could have been much better if it was told without its repetitive, boring and quite creepy humor specially focusing of glasses fetish and sister fetish. As a matter of fact the background stories of the characters seemed to have were quite nice but was turned into utter confused and unfocused stuff due to a show having 4-6 filler episodes in its 12 episode run (that might be some kind of record). Due to bad handling in making of the show, the somewhat interesting story lost all its flayer and turned out to be a chaotic endeavor. So it gets 6 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are the aforementioned girl and boy, and their friends and fellow club members the Nase siblings. The hero has so typical back story of being abandoned as a child and also having awesome yet tragic hidden powers, and has little development indeed. And his creepy glass fetish is so annoying that it makes it quite hard to even take him seriously, and liking him is quite impossible. Only Kuriyama seems to have a interesting back story which was again turned into confused stuff by the sudden resolution of her past, yet somehow at the later half of the anime she gets a nice little development and emotional aspect but yet again the resolution of the situation turns all these into somewhat of a disappointment. The other characters are so typical I think wasting words on them would be a crime, specially that sister complex is so awfully creepy. Characters get 5 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is one of the best aspects and really is quite eye candy. The fight scenes are so smooth and definitely one of the things I looked forward to each show. Although the character design is so unidirectional having all the characters look too good looking, the smooth animation and overall art takes the show up a few notch and gets 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of this show is quite excellent and unarguably one of the best this season. As a matter of fact the amount of emotion the OP and ED alone conveys, that the whole season of the actual show couldn't do even half of it. The OP is \"Kyoukai no Kanata\" by Minori Chihara, which is a melodic piece, which is a very emotional song with great lyrics and nice composition, The ED is \"Daisy\" by Stereo Dive Foundation which is even better with its excellent instrumentation as well as beautiful vocal, and the lyrics is so appropriate for the romantic aspect of the show, as a matter of fact if the actual show had as much romantic emotions executed as nicely as this song it would have been way better than it is now. The in show music is also very good and quite often distracts us in a good way from the lame storyline. The music of the show is top-notch and gets a 9 out of 10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of my review I would like to say this show might have been so much better if done by other people but sadly the execution by the makers was so poor that the show lost all its good aspect while somehow baring all its flaws. But I would like to also mention that you should at least give this show a try for its excellent music alone as it is one of the best this fall. But the rest is so unoriginal and frustrating, oh,well at least try to get the OST may be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score -\\n\r\n                         6 out of 10.",

In all honesty, maybe I had too much expectations from this show. It had an amazing artwork, characters that looked deep and interesting, and a nice concept.\r\nI am mad at the creators of this show. M. A. D. They left so many innuendos about the different characters but never exploited any. Instead, they focused on the moe, megane and nii-chan fetishes that really didn't bring anything to the show, as well as homosexual \"hints\". It could have beenintegrated tastefully, but it was just thrown on there to attract otaku crowds. The only characters that were \"partly\" developed are the two main characters. Others seemed to have deep, interesting back-stories, but none of them was brought up.\\n\\n\r\nThese characters deserved a 24-episodes show, plenty of development, tasteful humour and tiny bits of tragedy, along with a sensible plot instead of one that just makes no sense at all for the sake of an ending that would please the fans.\\n",

The opening sequence was so heart-pounding and exciting, and I felt like the show was doing a good job with world-building and setting itself apart from the standard supernatural high school series. But Mirai's constant clumsiness and general incompetence is so clearly fan baiting that it wore me down quickly. \r\nThe final straw was Hiroomi and Akihito talking projecting their fetishes onto Mitsuki -- who I think is a pretty funny, smart and interesting character. Show me a topless minor and youbetter believe I'm getting the hell out.\\n\\n\r\nThe other great flaw was the writing which was pretty ham-fisted, but who knows what lies beyond the third episode.

            "content": "Over the past few years, Kyoto Animation\u2019s production quality has gotten exponentially better. With their latest CM of Violet Evergarden, it\u2019s pretty safe to say when it comes to visuals, Kyoto Animation reigns supreme. Unfortunately, however, this abnormally fast improvement of aesthetic has seemingly come at the cost of producing \u201cgood\u201d anime.\r\nSo with Kyoukai no Kanata, or \u201cBeyond the Boundary\u201d, comes a supernatural fantasy with aesthetically delightful action sequences but unfortunately a mess of everything else.\r\nOne of the first and most major reasons with why Kyoukai no Kanata fails to be anything but sub-par, is because the show doesn\u2019t know what it primarily wants tobe. The first arc\u2014which consists of the first 4-5 episodes\u2014is a blood-drenched gore-fest with brutal themes and flashbacks topped off with a plethora of fight sequences all set in a trippy, vividly coloured setting that looks like something straight out of an Inception dream sequence. The next episode? A filler-esque episode of the cast dancing and singing like idols to a JPop theme. While this polarizing inconsistency may be entertaining in its own right, it creates a very jarring experience that makes the show feel childish; which is odd considering how brutal and supposedly mature the first 4 episode arc is. This tonal shift is also peppered throughout the show in general, many times during a dramatic reveal one of the characters will crack a joke somehow and the comic relief immediately deflates any tension that existed in the first place; it is difficult to be emotionally impacted by the events in the show because of this.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who\u2019s seen Kyoukai no Kanata can very easily argue it is, due to its setting, inherently reminiscent of the title \u201cNoragami\u201d. It goes without saying but both shows are very clearly trying to go for something different. It is obvious Kyoukai no Kanata is more invested in its characters and their relationships, as opposed to Noragami which was more invested in its narrative. The first proof of this is the substantially large cast of important characters present in the show. Almost every character plays a distinct and important role that impacts the narrative in one way or the other. This is where problems begin to arise, as characters who\u2019ve received minuscule amounts of fleshing out are suddenly key players in the driving force of the narrative. Their lack of development makes the progression of the show feel very contrived, and in turn creates an unpleasant watching experience. The weight of the ultimately difficult decisions that come to fruition end up feeling\u2026 well, weightless, because the progression doesn\u2019t feel natural and realistic. You can tell the situation was contrived from essentially thin air as a means to an end with a dramatic conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nElaborating more on Kyoukai no Kanata\u2019s investment in the characters, it is further proven by their 4 main leads\u2014half of which are flat, 2 dimensional characters that essentially can be reduced to precisely 1 trait or quirk. The two culprits I\u2019m referring to are the siblings Nase Hiromi\u2014whose most notable trait is his sister complex\u2014and Nase Mitsuki\u2014whose most notable trait is her abrasive personality. Do they have backgrounds? Nope. Do they act like siblings? Not with Hiromi constantly trying to be romantically involved with his sister, nope. Do they behave consistently? Hiromi consistently tries to make moves towards his sister, and his sister consistently disparages everyone and everything around her, if any of that counts. These 2 paper thin characters in turn sabotage the rest of the main cast, as it is difficult to write engaging and natural character interactions within a quartet of characters when a pair of them have no depth to their personality. Excluding expository dialogue, almost every single interaction between the main cast is simply an obnoxious one liner gag or a joke, or some kind of further emphasis on one of the characters quirks, be it a sister complex, glasses fetish, etc.\\n\\n\r\nIn Episode 11 is where one of the only engaging character conversations/interactions reside, and, surprise, surprise, it takes place between the other pair of character in the main cast\u2014the only ones actually fleshed out. Watching this up against the previous series of superficial interactions really emphasizes how enjoyable it is when done right. \\n\\n\r\nSomething else that should be mentioned is the really shallow setting, despite its seemingly distinctive and original nature. The \u201cSociety of Spirit World Warriors\u201d is mentioned dozens of times throughout the show, yet, it is never explored in any way, shape, or form. Characters from the Society do indeed exist and appear, though the Society itself is never built upon; this just compounds on the poor world building of the show. The hierarchies of different families and members of the Society are never explained nor shown in detail, the people in power are left as ambiguous voices, etc. Letting these threads of the plot be covered by a cloud of uncertainty is quite irksome, to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nThe way the primary human antagonist is written is actually impressively bad. He never receives any introspection or any fleshing out of the sort that it\u2019s almost like he\u2019s a dimensionless character\u2026 fortunately the few lines of dialogue he spews and his facial features convey his personality well enough to at least let the viewer feel a presence when he\u2019s on screen. His motives are really stupid and illogical, and he clearly exists just as a means to further the plot. So if you\u2019re the type of person who loves a good villain, Kyoukai no Kanata has nothing to offer you.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a plot twist, towards the end of the show, that is not really all that impactful once everything else in the show eventually totals up to do nothing but lessen your enjoyment of everything. It\u2019s a bit interesting, whether or not it is worth sitting through 90% of the show will vary greatly from person to person, so depending on how much the things I\u2019ve described would bother you should dictate whether or not it\u2019s worth sitting through.\\n\\n\r\nWith drama, romance and slice of life very clearly being KyoAni\u2019s forte, they have still shown before that they\u2019re not afraid and are more than capable of animating gorgeous and well-choreographed action sequences, as seen in the imaginary battles of \u201cLove, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!\u201d This skilled and precise animation skill is more than successfully transferred over to Kyoukai no Kanata, with awesome, easy-to-follow fight scenes with vivid colours and great sound effects. As for everything else pertaining to visuals, let\u2019s just leave it at \u201cit\u2019s Kyoto Animation.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6.5/10 || Overall 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end of all this, Kyoukai no Kanata is fundamentally just another show that has a drop dead gorgeous visuals, a somewhat interesting premise, flat characters, and a cheap ending. It was unable to trick me into falling for their muddled narrative with pretty colours, but the pretty colours were fun to watch nonetheless. I\u2019d recommend this to anyone looking for a fun time killer as well as have an appreciation for good audiovisuals. For other recommendations you might want to check out \u201cNoragami\u201d as it is quite similar in terms of premise and setting. \\n\\n\r\nI hope this review was informative and helpful.",

            "content": "Have you ever heard of the term \u201cwasted potential\u201d?\r\nIntro: Kyoto Animation has developed a reputation over the years. They\u2019re known for amazing animation, but they tend to focus mainly on slice of life shows with tons of MOE and basically cute girls doing cute things. They only recently stepped out of this rut (sort of) with the manservice show known as Free. But then again it played out like a typical Kyotoani show, but with guys. So when I heard they were making a show focused more on action, I was immediately skeptical. Did it impress me? Let\u2019s find out.\r\nStory: Kyoukai no Kanata takes placein a fantasy world filled with magic and monsters. These monsters are known as Youmu. Most of these Youmu are presented as terrible creatures that kill humans. Then there are humans called Spirit World Warriors who use magic to stop these creatures from killing people. The story follows our main character named Akihito Kanbara. He is an immortal half Youmu/Human hybrid who meets a Spirit World Warrior named Mirai Kuriyama. It continues from there as you learn about the world and how they live in it.\\n\\n\r\nI have a huge problem with the story. It sets up this big and interesting world that you want to find out more about, and it\u2019s barely explored. We don\u2019t really find out much of anything about this world, which I was very disappointed with. I would have loved to see some other Spirit World Warriors and how their society works. It doesn\u2019t help when the anime itself has filler episodes. They could have easily cut these two episodes out and gave us two for more world building or character development. And to make things even worse, the last few episodes have info dumping, which could have been fixed with two more episodes to work with. And the ending of the story contains an ass pull that is simply there to give it a feel good ending. And if you\u2019re wondering, the characters aren\u2019t much better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: One word description for the characters: bland. There are four main characters in Kyoukai no Kanata. Akihito Kanbara is an immortal half Youmu/Human hybrid who is open, VERY OPEN, about his glasses fetish. Mirai Kuriyama is a Spirit World Warrior who has the power of manipulating her own blood. She is also your typical Kyotoani Moe girl. Hiroomi Nase is a friend of Akihito who has a sister complex. Then there is his sister Mitsuki Nase who verbally abuse Akihito and her brother.\\n\\n\r\nSo you might be wondering about character development. My question is, what development? These characters don\u2019t develop at all from what I remember. They basically stay the same the entire show. Okay, MAYBE there is a romance subplot that goes absolutely nowhere. The side characters do little to nothing to help the plot and there are times where I can\u2019t even remember their names. There\u2019s an antagonist that is extremely forgettable and character back stories that allude to something great but we get NOTHING.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: This is Kyoto Animation. So Kyoukai no Kanata looks GOREGEOUS. From the movements to the colors and character designs. This anime is visually stunning. Action scenes are one of the shows biggest highlights and it looks freaking incredible. I didn\u2019t notice the animation quality dip at all in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The only noticeable piece of music is the ending song. Aside from that, everything else is pretty hit or miss. Sure the music is fitting, but it\u2019s pretty forgettable. The Japanese voice acting is fitting and they all express emotion where they need to.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Did I enjoy Kyoukai no Kanata? Well, sort of. I enjoyed the action scenes the most, while the story and characters just fell flat for me. I felt that the anime could have been something much greater than what it turned out to be. It fell to being a fairly average anime with great animation. That is what you call wasted potential. 3.5/5\\n",

            "content": "I know many people out there doesn't like this particular anime. And i wont blame them. The anime is tailored in such a way that it tends to attract mixed opinions.\r\nSo here is my honest review for the anime.\r\nPlot- Please google it. I wont waste time here.\r\nNow getting to the important matter, the greatest thing about this anime is the growing love story between the two protagonist. I mean it has really a cute approach and yet feels mature. Though it is mainly an actioned centred anime, the romantic element doesn't look left out at all.  All the characters are given equal detail andthe animation is just GORGEOUS. Its an EYE-FEAST.\\n\\n\r\nIt has just the right dose of humour and the story is believable. Though the concept is nothing new or special, its the other elements that outshines the bleak plot. \\n\r\nThis anime takes you to a journey of a different dimension where\"YOMU\" (Japanese spirits, gods etc exists). See its nothing new, but the perspective of the anime that the creators have developed is just great. Also thanks to the beautiful art, the anime is lively.\\n\r\nThe anime also boasts some beautiful soundtracks. The OP and ED are both beautiful. (Listen to it even if you do not plan on watching it)\\n\\n\r\nIt has its flaws too. The story is somewhat unparalleled. If u miss even a single dialogue, u may want to go through it again to get a hook of it. Few episodes seems like a drag. \\n\\n\r\nFinally i would say that its a decent anime that totally deserves a watch. The flaws can be easily overlooked by the animation quality and story development. I only wished if the story execution was better.  Those who like action anime and doesn't mind a romantic touch, this anime is definitely for them. A perfect blend of humour, action and romance.  \\n\\n\r\nP.S- for those who have already watched it, two movies are coming for the series. The first one is basically a recap and the second one is a sequel. It takes place after a year in the KnK universe. Airing date- 04/15",

            "content": "I was slightly reluctant to watch this anime at first. I had seen the first half of the first episode at anime club. At home, I was desperately hoping to watch SAO, but I made myself a resolution that I would go through every anime I start. In the end, I don\u2019t regret deciding to finish this series off.\r\nI really want to give the story element a good score. I really do. But unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t deserve more than a 5.5. Right from the very start I found quite a few aspects confusing, especially about the nature of youmu and Spirit World Warriors. I endedup googling them before I could understand. I think what they\u2019re trying to do is immerse the viewer into the world of the anime so that they figure everything out on their rather than explaining stuff. Eh, not my style, and quite confusing in the end. I\u2019m not a huge fan of when characters explain stuff more than they need to, but in this case they didn\u2019t explain stuff enough. In fact, I think that the ending was ruined for me because of the sheer amount of stuff I didn\u2019t understand. They introduced a lot of new concepts in the last episode, which is fine by me IF they answer the questions that are posed before the end of the series. Kyoukai no Kanata failed to do this. Whilst it wasn\u2019t boring, there wasn\u2019t a particular direction to the plot line either.\\n\r\nApart from those flaws, I found the story interesting and original. While it is relatively dark, there are plenty of light-hearted moments. Sure, the jokes aren\u2019t that great and are quite shallow, so I didn\u2019t laugh a lot, but I did smile often.The element of humour was very much welcome and did not go overboard. \\n\\n\r\nAn element that was very much appreciated in my eyes was the art. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not the best out there, but it is the best I have seen so far. It had a realistic quality whilst still remaining in the anime genre. A 9, I would say.\\n\\n\r\nI believe that one of my favourite things about anime is the music. I relish the chance to find beautiful music, which, when I hear it, can relate to a particular scene or anime. For me that is very special. Kyoukai no Kanata lacked tracks, which was quite disappointing, but the tracks that it did have were beautiful, and I have downloaded all the ones I could find. Considering how much I like the tracks present, there just wasn\u2019t enough to quell my desire. A 6.8, I\u2019m sad to say.\\n\\n\r\nBut, the thing I enjoyed the most about this anime is the character development. This is an area which has often been below a decent level in the other anime I have seen. Considering the amount of characters, Kyoukai no Kanata excels in this aspect, which I believe to be very important. I cannot stress how happy I am with the characters in this anime. This is the best I have seen so far. Not only do the main characters get a good amount of development, but the supporting characters also get their fair share. To prove my point, my favourite character is a supporting character who doesn\u2019t really add too much to the plot line. Yes, I know that Ai-chan does get quite a bit of screen time, and she is quite likeable, but still\u2026 I do agree that they could have done a better job for the adults, but I am more than satisfied with these strong characters. I shouldn\u2019t really give this score, but I can\u2019t help it. 10.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Kyoukai no Kanata was a very good anime and I enjoyed watching it. The art was beautiful, the music as well though there wasn\u2019t much of it. The great character development almost makes up for the terribly confusing story line. \\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nStory: 5.5/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 6.8/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.86/10 (rounded to 8)",

            "content": "At some point, someone had a vivid dream with a lot of cool visuals. He pitched them to a studio with a lot of budget and they said, yeah, we\u2019ll run with it. Perhaps some asked about character design and plotting and symbolism, perhaps not. If they did, the production committee just said \u2018oh, what the hell\u2019. They hoped that by the force of sheer charisma and some visual inventiveness, it\u2019ll be easy to miss how empty the whole thing is\r\nWhat producers miss about anime like these is that you can\u2019t mask emptiness. Great anime with great visuals who do bizarre things but somehow succeeddon\u2019t rely on a single element. Grand experiments like Future Diary work because they leave no stone unturned, and no element unfocused. That anime wanted the whole thing \u2013 psychology and philosophy and character development and action and romance. It wasn\u2019t successful, but it was brave and that made it exciting.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the Boundary doesn\u2019t seek to replicate this specific method. Rather, it tries to impress by sheer volume and energy. Wackiness is the essence and it works in some places. The dreamshades never look like ordinary enemies. An arc concludes in a surreal fight which includes a train floating in free space. In the climax, there is some kind of paralell world floating above ours. Inside it there\u2019s terrain that\u2019s always shifting. The main antagonist trap himself and another person inside empty white space. That\u2019s quite cool, at least visually.\\n\\n\r\nOur characters, in the beginning, are given more than stereotypes. Slight differences in dialogue, like how the little sister\u2019s insults tend to drag on \u2013 add life. Even quirks that have nothing to do with personality, like Mirai collecting bonsais helps to add life. These tiny details are the differences between actual human beings. Usually, adding quirks without connecting them to a personality is a sign of sloppy writing. The series finds ways to balance those, with Mirai\u2019s collection only cropping up occasionally \u2013 enough to show us he has interests outside the story, not enough for the quirk to beg for importance.\\n\\n\r\nThen it\u2019s over. Nothing happens to these characters across 12 episodes. I didn\u2019t expect deep psychological portraits, but I expected versatility. A one-dimensional character isn\u2019t one with one trait. Rather, it\u2019s one that reacts in a predictable, repetitive and almost mechanical fashion. If a character uses the same sentence in each situation, it\u2019s one-dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nNow, catchphrases can be fun but the characters have nothing but catchphrases. Once they stick to a quirk, they never let go of it. In the early light-hearted moments, the right comic timing makes these invisible. This flaw is more apparent in the last, \u2018serious\u2019 part of the series. The world is about to end, people might die and we still get the old joke about how Hiro\u2019omi loves little sisters. In the midst of the apocalypse, characters still kick the silly woman\\n\\n\r\nA character doesn\u2019t have to change through the course of the story. What must happen is revelations. The new events need to reveal something new. Even if your character is defined by one trait, different events should show different sides of this trait. When the apocalypse finally kicks in, everyone behaves in exactly the same way as in the first episode. The only difference is that they\u2019re slightly more serious. I know about Hiro\u2019omi in episode 1 just as much as I know about him in episode 12. In fact, I actually know less.\\n\\n\r\nThe Serious Turn is a problem for many such shows. You\u2019ve seen it in High School DXD and in Big Order, where an external enemy comes in and everyone works together to defeat it. The laziest storytelling is to give the hero some external thing to do, some sidequest and have them perform it. You don\u2019t have to be bothered with writing a personality. Just have the dude solve the murder or help the girl. Your typical airplane detective novel features such characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the Serious Turn arrives here, the anime loses all its vitality and quirkiness. Suddenly there\u2019s a whole conspiracy in the works that doesn\u2019t add anything. Characters become forgotten, vanishing for scenes and showing the authors had no idea what to do with them. They couldn\u2019t imagine how their personalities would react to the gigantic enemy, so they just have them stand there. If they move, it\u2019s because everyone needs to gang up on the bad guy.\\n\\n\r\nOur hero also loses his quirks and saves the world because he doesn\u2019t want his loved one hurt. What the Serious Turn shows us is how empty these characters are. If the quirks were connected to something bigger, the climax would\u2019ve been vastly different. Every character would have a unique way of reacting to it. The anime got me when Akky decided the world isn\u2019t worth living without the person sacrificing themselves to save the world. This cliche is only acceptable in ultra-ridiculous heroic stories. If your stories are ultra-ridiculous, your characters will be too and they\u2019ll actually react to events in ridiculous, memorable ways instead of convenient ones.\\n\\n\r\nOnly Mirai rises above the mire. She could\u2019ve been better, being pushed towards either the psychological direction or the ridiculous direction. As it stands, she\u2019s a beacon of charisma in an otherwise empty cast. She has a personality that adjusts her reaction. The clumsy, hesitant and bumbling persona isn\u2019t the most original. Mirai\u2019s at least a convincing portray of it. When the climax hits, she\u2019s still a mess, still uncomfortable in her own skin. Her personality might not be particularly original, but at least it exists and affects her reactions. It makes her the most alive character in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nShe\u2019s also the only one blessed with a good character design. It\u2019s bizarre that in an anime with perchance for odd imagery, everyone will look ordinary. Akky looks slightly better than most harem protagonists, but he has nothing going for him besides blonde hair. Hiromi has a nice bowl for a hair and that\u2019s where the distinctive details end. Some characters look so dull that it\u2019s a wonder they still put effort into giving them voice-actors. I don\u2019t expect them all to be as iconic as Mirai. As an expression of personality, Mirai\u2019s design was is fantastic. At least give me something to look at.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime could\u2019ve been a lot of fun. It does start off wild, with a wacky fantasy element and total disregard for making sense. Sadly, the creators didn\u2019t have the gusto \u2013 or the imagination \u2013 to fully go there. If it would\u2019ve been a nonsensical mess, it would\u2019ve at least been bizarre enough to ponder. Instead, it\u2019s another anime that settles on everyone being nice, saving the world from a dude who pushes up his glasses.\\n\\n\r\n2 people who got lost beyond 5 boundaries",

            "content": "If you read the reviews for this, you would probably think you had some idea of what was in store.  Some good, some bad, others lukewarm.\r\nI think its fair to point out that this isn't a character driven story.  If you were looking for deep characters and interesting relationships between them, you should have probably made sure this show had more than 12 episodes.  That isn't a cop out, but its important to check your expectations at the door.\r\nI don't usually go for the slice of life, tinged with romance angle, what more or less drew me in was the conflicting thoughtson it.  After seeing the show, i chuckled.\\n\\n\r\nKnK is essentially a story about breaking beyond the barriers of self doubt and self pity, to understand that while you may face troubles alone, you can share those with people you care about.  It's utterly simplistic in tone, yet elicits a powerful emotion that can be seen in the visuals and dialogue, in fact the entire story is aimed squarely at that feeling.\\n\\n\r\nWhile its certainly limited in scope, i think it got unfair criticism from people expecting something that it was clearly not meant to be.  I don't even understand classifying this as a dark fantasy, it wasn't dark for too long before the sun came right back up.  I think that is it's strength and appeal, aside from the beautiful art, the engaging even uplifting soundtrack, and also the intelligent use of characters that are meant to be easily and quickly relate-able.  \\n\\n\r\nYou can find faults in it, you can blame the chaaracters, accuse it of having plot holes, which it doesn't if you pay attention (not everything needs to be spoon fed to you), or dismiss the apparent convoluted story telling.  What you shouldn't do is miss the opportunity to judge for yourself.  It really did blend many elements together on its journey; and often its not end of the road that's important rather the journey itself.",

            "content": "Christ, where do I begin with KnK? It's gorgeous. It really is; I actually got very jealous at Mirai's ridiculously poofy hair. The animation with blood and special effects was also really great. The character designs are also memorable and cute.\r\nBut the plot... There was so much the studio could have done and so little done with what they did present. To be fair, I'll start with what I think they did do right.\r\nFirst, the main character, Akihito, is half-Youmu (basically a youkai/demon) and half-human. A hybrid protagonist is nothing new but unlike most he balances the time spent angsting about being a special snowflakeand the time being a normal kid. His conflict was believable and well-handled. His relationship with the other characters was also realistic, especially with the Nase family, who are an elite Spirit World Warrior (or Youmu hunter) clan. They regard him as a ticking time bomb so there's none of the usual WE'RE ALL FRIENDS AND TEAMMATES!! WE HAVE YOUR BACK NO MATTER WHAT nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nI won't say anything about Mirai besides the fact she has a cute design. There's so many ways you could interpret her character because of how the studio kept fumbling her characterization, rendering her nearly schizophrenic with how she behaves in each episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is my main beef with this series. They had TWO conflicts they could have worked with, namely the protagonist and his half-Youmu nature and the entire Youmu vs. Spirit World Warrior conflict. And they didn't use either to their fullest extent. There were so many possibilities and ways to use this kind of setting, but they wasted an entire episode for fan-service and introduced mostly inconsequential characters while sidelining the main characters throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nLook, I've seen people excuse it with saying it could be easily patched up with a second season but most anime don't get renewed for another season easily, and if your entire first season depends on a hypothetical second season to tie up loose plot threads, you are not a good writer.\\n\\n\r\nWatch it if all you care about is cute designs and nice animation. If you're looking for a plot with actual depth, look elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, enjoyable, but frustrating.",

The main message of the anime is somewhat singular and explores the layers of what that message means. 5/10(70% of story)\r\nI can't not bring up the action as playing a major role in the way the story unfolds, where some would brush it off into the Art category. 10/10(30% of story)\r\nMyattempt to explain why this anime's story style felt different to me:\\n\r\nThis anime is (overall) like a large puzzle that fills itself in as it grows bigger and sacrifices bits and pieces as it grows outward. This allows a lot more content to be discovered about earlier episodes regardless of arc, and i think this is what throws people off about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhere as most other anime have a small series-wide puzzle and each episode or arc fills in a separate puzzle, as to not leave any pieces out. \\n\r\nIf that makes sense lol.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10 - This is undeniably where the anime shines the brightest through the action scenes. Fluid, amazingly detailed, colorful. So many wonderful frames. This is where a good amount of the story takes place and for good reason.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8 - Nothing special here, satisfying without standing out. Voice acting was well done at conveying emotions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7 - Mirai, I found her to be something different then the average kawaii. She is absolutely charming and makes you smile with her quirks and it grows on you. This is something i haven't felt often in other animes or as strongly and i absolutely want more, a very simple character that adds depth through minor actions.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast comes off as relatively basic. The brother with a sister complex doesn't come off as sexual attraction anymore than just seeking affection from her.\\n\\n\r\nThe evil intentioned characters needed far more explanation + depth.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9 - You get a whole lot of insanely satisfying action and a bit of everything else. comedy, feels, darkness, hope, hopelessness. It rolls up into a trip that might not take the road you wanted, but makes its way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8 - This anime isn't anything new, but it felt fresh in its own way. It's like a restaurant brings you a slightly different dish then what you ordered, so you either return it in anger, or try it, and realize you wanted this instead of your original order.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Overall Rating - 10/10 I want to see new anime show a unique side like this did for me through superb action and a hard to describe different approach,  and correct what needed to be done better.",

            "content": "I was highly intrigued by this anime as I had saw numerous people use it in AMVs, but I didn't fully understand what it was about. Actually, I didn't know ANYTHING about it. For all I knew, I thought it was a dance anime for I had only seen the dance routine that the main characters performed in front of what seemed like a perverted monster (later to discover it actually had a name, Youmu). Basically, this anime was not what I thought it was going to be, but I was pleasantly surprised. It made me laugh, as well as cry, and that is whatI believe a great anime should do. I am never going to forget it, and here is why;\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (9/10):\\n\r\nApart from the beginning being a little confusing, I found the story to be a fascinating one. There were a lot of terms that were thrown at us in the first couple of episodes, it was hard to keep up, but once you understood them all you were set on a beautiful train-ride of emotions. I am not going to write a full blown summary of the anime here due to the fact that my description can not simply do it any justice. You will just have to go and watch the series yourself, as I highly recommend you do. Kyoukai no Kanata is only 12 episodes long, but they surprisingly make it work. It's a fun, enjoyable anime to watch that leaves you wanting more, but in a good way!\\n\\n\r\nART (10/10):\\n\r\nThe art style is absolutely flawless. KyoAni stuck to what they know best, \"kawai\", and it worked for them yet again. They did a perfect job on making the story come to life through it's visual design and detailed characters. I know Kyoto Animation best for their immaculate visual attention-to-detail and how realistic they can make their series look. It's definitely not sore on the eye. With it's vibrant colours and incredible looking creature (Youmu), I feel as if I am there in the story. The people who came up with the appearances for the Youmu are very creative, they must have very broad imaginations to come up with such intricate designs. They definitely used \"Blue Ocean Thinking\" when developing these \"monsters\".\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is so smooth, as I was extremely impressed with how the series opened (the viewer gets a first person, bird's eyed view of the city in which they live, I believe it's Kanto, as the camera guides us to the roof of a building and rushes us through Mirai's hair blowing in the wind). They didn't hold back on splashing in the cash in terms of design and I thank them for it.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I also have to comment on are the battle/fight scenes. These scenes were executed perfectly. I admire Kyoto Animation for coming out of their comfort zone (making \"moe\" slice-of-life anime) and trying to create a series which could definitely considered to be in the action genre. They did a great job in experimenting with fight scenes in Chuunibyou, so it is refreshingly sweet to see the company try something different and succeed so amazingly. I have read some reviews where people disagree with this view but I personally commend KyoAni for their efforts. More companies need to try to branch out and experiment, there are too many anime that are similar in multiple ways, I'm just glad Kyoukai no Kanata stands out from the bunch. At least to me anyway.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (10/10):\\n\r\nI haven't stopped listening to the ending song of each episode, STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION'S \"Daisy\", from the anime since I finished the series a matter of days ago. It is such an addictive listen. I love it. I have now officially broke the replay button on my phone. It is one of the best songs I have heard come out of an anime. With it's techno beat and soothing instrumentals, you're sure to fall in love as well as fall deep into your imagination, as you create an entire world in your head when listening. The song is about re-doing mistakes and amending love in broken relationships. It is extremely touching, which makes it one of the highlights of the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nI also really appreciated how the ED started in the background as the final scene was still playing out. This was an original idea which extremely worked in their favour, as it built up suspense and helped the flow of the anime. The singer's voice is also fantastic. Basically, you need to open up a new tab and listen to it as you read this right now. It's the right balance of happiness and melancholy, all at the same time. It's a song that helps resurface beautiful memories.\\n\\n\r\nThe music throughout the anime was also exceptional. Unlike other anime I have watched, the music didn't take away from what was going on or the atmosphere surrounding the characters. It built on their emotions and complimented them beautifully. I loved the song that was being played as Mirai was \"disappearing\" in one of the later episodes. It actually made me start to cry.\\n\\n\r\nI also just want to quickly add that the Voice-Acting was of great quality. I could hear the emotion clearly in each of the Actor's/Actresses voices, which greatly benefited my viewing experience. It was a super talented cast. Phenomenal casting decisions.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (9/10):\\n\r\nI really liked the characters, and I mean all of them. The protagonists were fascinating to watch and it was a delight to see their relationship develop. Akihito's mother (Yayoi Kanbara) was hilarious to begin with, though her fetishes and behaviour did start to get a bit annoying/repetitive as the series progressed. Though this is one of my only problems with the entire anime, not worth docking any marks for.\\n\\n\r\nHiroomi was a funny character, I also liked his \"No-homo\" relationship with Akihito. Many people found parts of their friendship irrelevant and an annoying addition to the series, though I found it quite entertaining. Both Akihito's and Hiroomi's fetishes were funny, particularly Akihito's as I would laugh every time his obsession \"took over him\". How unpleasant, Mirai might say if she was here right now! I also liked Ai's character. Being a Youmu who can transform into a human being is an interesting concept that KyoAni introduced rather well. It adds to the story, and it makes me like the \"Shindou\" family even more. How very convenient for Akihito, the Shindou's just so happen to have a photo studio on their premises. Poor Mirai! How unpleasant for her... *wink wink*\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (10/10):\\n\r\nI think it's safe to say I enjoyed every aspect of this series. From the music to the acting to the story line itself. It was a unique viewing experience, and an anime that I would definitely recommend to a friend. Many people didn't like the anime's comedic side, though I loved it. It wouldn't have affected the story line greatly if it would have been left out, but I thought it added to the anime in a big way. It's always nice to hear a joke now and then, anyone with a sense of humour appreciated it, I'm sure.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (10/10):\\n\r\nWhat's not to like? This anime totally surprised me in the best possible way. Do I regret losing 5 hours of my life to this anime? Of course not! If anything, it's added it my own life. It's definitely an anime I won't forget, and one I'll be proud of saying I have watched. Even though I loved it, I would not like a sequel it fear that what I cherish could be butchered. Instead, I hope there will be an episode some time in the future that will show us where all the characters are in their lives now. Akihito is immortal but from what I know, Mirai isn't so I'm a little worried for their long-term future together. But apart from that, that's the reason I'm holding out for an OVA.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my first ever review on MyAnimeList, I hope you found it useful! Please watch this anime, it is awesome!",

            "content": "What could go wrong with an anime about a girl who is shunned for being able to manipulate her blood and a boy who feels like an outsider because he's half-demon? What could go wrong with an anime produced by one of the best studios in Japan - a studio with a string of successful anime under their belt and a history of great animation? Apparently, a lot.\r\nKyoukai no Kanata suffers most from poor direction. When one sees \"dark fantasy\" in an anime's description, one expects an anime to be exactly that - a dark fantasy. However, somewhere along the line, Kyoukai no Kanata turnedinto Kyoto Animation's typical slice-of-life anime with a high school setting (with some poorly timed stale humour thrown in for lols). This is especially obvious in the idol episode which completely derails the whole anime and turns Kyoukai no Kanata into a tonally confused mish-mash with absolutely no sense of a story. \\n\\n\r\nTo make matters worse, the main characters of Kyoukai no Kanata were so insipid they were difficult to hate. I felt absolutely nothing towards them as a viewer. They had no depth and were incredibly flat - it felt like Kyo Ani were characterising them by their quirks and looks rather than their actual personalities.\\n\\n\r\nThis was most pronounced with Kuriyama Mirai who was incredibly cute with her cool hair and glasses. But asides from her cool hair and her glasses, there really wasn't much else to her at all. She had some scars, but that back story wasn't explored enough for me to feel any true sympathy towards her. Besides, her character trajectory was glossed over so quickly I didn't really understand the extent of her relationship with the girl she killed. This was similar with Kanbara Akihito: I defined him more by his (annoying) obsession with glasses and girls who wear them rather than the struggles he faced as someone who is half-demon. The chemistry between the two main characters was also completely non-existent, which made me wonder how they had even fallen in love. I just couldn't buy their romance and saw their feelings as nothing more than Mirai's appreciation for her Senpai, and Akihito's obsession with a chick who wears glasses. I'm not even going to talk about the Nase siblings because there was nothing to them whatsoever. I mean, nothing. They were like wallpaper. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't really care much for the voice-acting - nothing was particularly outstanding, and most of the characters tend to speak in the same tone throughout. The art and animation, however, were excellent - and I don't expect anything less from Kyo Ani. Beautiful colours, individual designs, fluid movements and excellent battle scenes made Kyoukai no Kanata a very eye-pleasing watch. Nevertheless, there's only so much a pretty animation can do for a vapid story.",

            "content": "KnK could've been great. I promise: SPOILER FREE. The concept of a warrior who wields her own blood is pretty kickass. But instead of watching a supernatural spirit bounty hunter kick some ass, we watch as a bland, predictable romance unfolds. Metrics: Story: 5 // Art: 8 // Sound: 8 // Characters: 4 // Enjoyment: 6 // Overall: 6\r\nPros: \r\n*The best part of this show is the action sequences. We're talking Gundam-level fight scenes (take that as you will) with some cool powers being used, from Mirai as well as the Nase family. Animation is good during fights, but they aren't as common as I'dlike them to be. \\n\r\n*The comedy lands well. When trying to be, the characters' dialogue is funny, and Mirai's \"fuyukae desu\" catchphrase is adorable. The jokes about the main male characters being pervs are funny since they're pretty outlandish, given the setting. \\n\r\n*Mirai is kind of waifu-bait, but she's really good. She's probably the main reason I watched the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nCons: My BIGGEST con is \\n\r\n*that the show takes no risks, and because of this, none of the characters ever really grow. For example, in one scene, a neutral-ish character murders an innocent bystander in cold blood. It could've represented her conclusive turn to being evil, but instead, the show baits you for three seconds and then basically goes \"actually, she missed\" and the character is alive again. This is done at least three times. I'm sorry, but if you're going to kill someone off, kill them dead. \\n\r\n*Mirai and the Nase family are good, but the rest of the cast is pretty lame, including the male protag. Akihito is bland, from start to finish, and makes me wonder if the writers knew what normal social behavior is like. The big bad guy is evil just for the sake of being evil. He doesn't gain anything from destroying the world. \\n\r\n*As mentioned before, the romance is predictable. While they ultimately give a backstory as to why Mirai is a tsundere, she is still one throughout the whole show. The way Akihito handles romance is so wildly unrealistic that it's painful. \\n\r\n*There is a lack of communication with the audience. What I mean, is they \"reveal\" new information on occasion, with no build-up or even hint to it. Otherwise, we just feel ripped off that we didn't know anything prior (see: Izumi's secret). It ends up carrying no weight because we don't know how the character themselves feels about the secret, so it's impossible to understand what is at stake for them. \\n\r\n*The ending is.....odd. It definitely felt rushed; this show would've benefitted from being 18 or 24 episodes for such. I think I was unhappy with either resolution, you'll see what I mean. \\n",

Typically, they tend to make Moe slice of life but they adapted a supernatural light novel. the anime is based on the novel by the same name written by Torii nagomu and illustrated by Kamoi Tomoyo.\r\nYoumu are spirits that roam the city, They are the manifestation of human negative emotions as stated in the synopsis though we never get to seethem through the whole series it never feels that Hunting Down those creatures is the main highlight of the show. Walking through the first episode we meet Akihito Kanbara our main protagonist who stumble upon a girl who is about to throw herself from the school rooftop, Never to realise that this character will change his life .  \\n\\n\r\nThe settings is our modern world as our main character Mirai struggles with her dark past, blaming herself for the death of her childhood friend, uses the power to manipulate  her blood at will. I found this character  so bland and basic,you got your typical highschool girl with uninteresting yet childish personality, she has the ultimate rival sakura yui\u2019s sister who swore vengeance for her long lost sister, Then we have akahito the half-human half-youmu who has a fetish for beautiful girls with glasses (That level of creativity though). because that\u2019s the only thing that stands out from his personality, and we have our supporting cast. Hiromi who has imouto syndrome, and his sister the one with strong personality. They together join the literature  club (yeah they had to join a club). to complete your typical school anime That Destroyed the Interesting premise and replaced it with a school anime with perverts, cliches, uninteresting characters and a comedy that in most cases seems misplaced and simply out of place. Not to mention that Filler episode with the dance ughhhh\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and art wise the show is masterfully animated with a lot of sakuga moments, This was the turning point for me it was so pleasant to watch such animation. I am a big fan of kyoani and their moelike character designs so that\u2019s another thing i enjoyed. Overall the show was aesthetics over substance. It was filled with boring moments uninteresting dialogue and catchphrases that kept me Waiting for that character to disappear. Also the sound was great, awesome OST with great emotional value. Never skipped the opening and ending credits they were so good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i feel this anime is just a show about cool animation and aesthetics i never cared about the characters or the plot it\u2019s just Sakuga the anime. So yeah the score is just for the animation and sound and My devotion to Kyoani.\\n\\n",

            "content": "First impressions count for a lot. That's true for a lot of things, but especially in anime. There are so many shows and so little time to watch them all, so being able to grab you right from the outset is, if not an indicator or overall quality, at least a good start in gaining traction and attention.\r\nKyoukai no Kanata, or Beyond the Boundary, begins with our lead hero trying to talk a girl out of a suicide attempt by saying he finds her sexy, to which she responds by stabbing him through the chest with a blade forged from her own blood.\r\nIn other words,I was rooting for this show from the word \"Go\".\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the Boundary is definitely an odd show, as familiar at it feels at times. Set in a Japanese high school (of course), the story centers around a group of Spirit World warriors, superpowered teens who clean up evil spirits as a part-time job. Our aforementioned hero is Akihito Kanbara, an immortal half-youmu SW warrior with a deadpan snark, a classic light/dark struggle with his monstrous side, and a glasses fetish. That last detail is what brings him into contact with the bespeckled beauty standing on the school roof: Mirai Kuriyama, the sole remainder of a tribe of SW warriors who use their blood to fight. From there on, the plot unspools into conspiracies, hidden agendas, and big surprises that, honestly, you can pretty much see coming from a mile away.\\n\\n\r\nObviously from that description, Beyond the Boundary's plot isn't its strongest suit. Once all the conspiracy stuff starts shaking out as the story progresses, the whole thing kind of falls apart. The logic is weak, the surprises aren't surprising, and the whole thing ends up feeling like too much ado about nothing. Characters come and go, never staying around for long enough stretches to really build investment outside of our central foursome. It feels lazily hacked together, rather than carefully constructed, and it really starts dragging the series down the longer it goes on.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, my mind keeps going back to that wacky, almost farcical first scene. Akihito's complete lack of shame in expressing his true feelings right off the bat. The almost casual way in which Mirai responds by skewering him. His equally casual response as he reacts to the glistening red blade sticking through his body (because he's immortal, natch). It's such a unique, offbeat attitude that you don't really see a lot, reminiscent of the fantastic absurdist comedy in Angel Beats.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it's here that Beyond the Boundary really shines: its character interactions. The teenagers of the Spirit World warriors all talk and act like real teenagers. They bicker, they bounce off each other, they get on each other's nerves and enjoy doing so. They aren't paralyzed with embarrassment every other second, instead funneling the energy of their embarrassment into one-upping the person who embarrassed them. It's so freaking refreshing to have a lead who can just outright talk about finding someone attractive to their face, and to have his target of affections able to needle him for it without descending into flustered stuttering. Heck, one of our main characters has a freaking sister complex, and even THAT ends up being funny more often than not, just by the nature of how forthright he is about it and how casually said sister is able to rip him about it whenever it comes up. That, in and of itself, is reason enough to praise Beyond the Boundary to heaven and back.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this is also a Kyoto Animation show, which means I absolutely MUST gush about the stellar animation for a bit. This show has one of my favorite color palettes of all time, a sort of muted-rainbow pastel that makes even the most boring locations pop with color and warmth. KyoAni's talent for animating the subtleties of human movement is also on full display, with Mirai in particular having a plethora of absolutely adorable tics. In addition, for a studio that almost never touches action with a ten-foot pole, Beyond the Boundary makes a good case for them to try it more often. Turns out, the kinetic energy of KyoAni's camera movements that are usually focused on big emotional beats in other series translates quite nicely to the world of high-octane spirit battles. The choreography is fluid and easy to follow, and the use of colors during battle makes each clash feel like an exploding paint set, in the best way possible.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Beyond the Boundary is a really good case study in how much attitude can save a series. On a structural level, it's a complete mess, and the pieces never really fit together in a satisfying way. But it keeps its head high and soldiers on, brimming with enough confidence, cheer, and good vibes to wash away any possible bad taste. It's flawed, unfocused, and way too ambitious for its own good, but it's an entertaining romp all the same. As Mirai might say, it's far from unpleasant.",

            "content": "Kyoukai no kanata is a weird one. It has a LOT of bad qualities to it... the fights with a thousand shining effects and great animation with amazing potential yet at times wasted on extremely non dynamic fights, that constantly stop and waver for no reason at all; the first painfully slow and, at first glance, corny and unnecessary episodes.\r\nI say at first glance, because when you get to about episode 10 in the anime you realize why everyone was reacting and acting like they did in the beginning, what first seemed like a run of the mill and bland love story set in aschool that serves as a background for a normal demon hunting theme with gratifying fight scenes, blooms into something real when we finally are introduced to the fact that the shows story starts being told in the middle of the overall narrative. when this is finally told to us we realize that the seemingly baseless and awkward actions and dialog choices taken by the characters actually had a lot of substance behind them\\n\r\nI personally love that this is the case, i very much liked the fact the story turned upside down showing us what had happened before the beginning of the anime while also giving us insight into what was happening in the present episode, and the anime does this in an amazing series of cuts that kept me at the edge of my seat, and together constitute one of my favorite anime episodes in terms of creative story telling.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does have its bad points though, one of the biggest being that this amazing revelation episode aforementioned is the 10th episode, yes the 10th, the amazingly good plot development and story telling happens only 2 episodes away from the end. And 9 episodes, in my opinion is too big a time period to wait for the story to progress into an interesting development. Don't get me wrong the 10th episode is not the series only good one, there are a handful of good entertaining and interesting episodes before then, the 6th one being absolutely hilarious, comedy and entertainment value apart though, the first episodes of this taste incredibly bland and non interesting story wise.\\n\\n\r\nWhat kept me going through this initial blandness apart from the hopes of it not ending like this, was the art and really good and solid fight scenes, that i hoped would escalate in the end; Sadly, they do not, but instead the show seemingly learns from its mistakes and after letting the story overshadow the action in the later half it uses these amazing fights as a very solid base for the more important narrative.\\n\r\nIn retrospect the beginning lacks focus, the show has a hard time deciding whether it wants to focus on the interpersonal interaction between characters or the demon hunting action and world struggle, constantly shifting between focusing on one and painfully extending the other. At points totally ruining some of the characters because of it, as is the case for pre episode 10 Kuriyama, who apparently decides to wander around for the whole thing, and made me honestly hate her.\\n\\n\r\nAll of  this being said, i feel that Kyoukai no Kanata is a very solid piece and ties together nicely at the end, after re watching it i feel as though it does not deserve the 10 mark, but the fact that it is very dear to me keeps it up there. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "That is the question I keep asking myself while watching this show. Time and time again I was wondering if the show was suppose to be a dark and serious show or a slice of life because sure the first episode gripped you with the topic of suicide which you realize right off the bat that it was going to be a dark show. However, as the plot continues it switches genres in a pinch trying to add comedy to a seemingly dark and serious show. For example, mid-series after the climax of the first half of this show it immediately died down with amusical number done by the main characters.  This is where they all tap into their inner teen idol and did a choreographed dance that went along with it. \\n\r\n\tSpeaking of the characters the show presented a quite a wide variety of characters ranging from a guy with a glasses fetish to a girl that is a nervous wreck. Sure I will admit that these characters sightly developed over time but it is hard to spot. These characters top traits come out when it feels like a slice of life show. I am only going to describe the the most important which is Akihito and Mirai.\\n\r\n\tAkihito: The main character of the show who is the one that I mentioned before who has a glasses fetish and proves it time and time again that he has one. That aside he was a decent character who has amazing power to the point that the best warriors in the city can't handle him. His back story is not there and his origins of how and where he got this power is unknown. Even though we already know he has parents the youmu side is from his dad and his human side is from his mom. But the show doesn't present the dad or the mom is not taken seriously as a person who apparently knows everything that is going on. Who is also a extremely powerful warrior for no good reason of how she is presented. Which she demonstrates in the 2nd to last episode. Which left massive holes in the plot and character in general.\\n\r\n\tMirai: The main female character who is a slight nervous wreck who doesn't know how to act a situation but as the series continue she develops into less of a wreck but more into a brave person who in the end made really hard decisions to keep her friend alive. This resulted in a better character development in most shows that I have seen recently so I will respect that. However, her back story is a little different as I said before during Akihito's paragraph that there are holes in the plot and her character too. For example her power and her clan, it asks the question why was it such a bad thing to have her power, why was she the only one left, Where did she get her training from (because you don't start off as a highly capable fighter ever since you were born), and I could go on with the list. But overall she was a good character who in one episode has a reason for everything that she did prior to that episode so some things are explained but not a lot. One more thing this is a major spoiler for anyone reading this before watching the show so move on to the next segment, The last episode when Mirai died and was brought back to life was strange and didn't make sense because how do you die in a dimension and then all of a sudden reappear like nothing happen this is also not explained which confused me. The reason being she already know she was going to die when she defeated beyond the boundary because she already died in the real world then why is she alive, I get it happy ending and all but still not explained.\\n\r\n\tAs I continue, this review is not here for the nitpicks this is also here to praise it on certain and important aspects such as the animation which is immaculate from start to finish. This show has presented itself to be a masterpiece. I will even go as far to say this is on par as fate zero's animation. The ending credits and opening is a joy to watch and it would have been an honor to watch this in 1080p or even 720p. The fight scene were entertaining and a joy to watch to the point where I was re-watching most of it.\\n\r\n\tThe sound for the show was also top-notch in its own right it keeps the atmosphere of the show whether it be a slice of life side or serious side. However, highlights goes to the opening and closing song which does well to get you hyped to watch the rest of the episode. Also, the smooth transition of the final scene of the episode to the ending credits and song which leaves some decent but not rage inducing cliff-hangers. The animation and the sound were also some of the only reasons I kept watching this.\\n\r\n\tIn conclusion the show was a hit or miss (sometimes mostly miss for what the show is suppose to present because of the random genre changes) with almost bland characters (almost) a lot of random holes in the plot only to be topped off with fantastic animation, and great sound. If Kyoto animation filled these random holes of the plot make characters back story a little more... there, and chose which genre they wanted to go for this would have easily be one of my tops favorite anime of all time along side with steins gates, gurren lagann, madoka magica, and fate zero. \\n\r\nRemember this is my personal opinion and if you want to clarify anything for me or help me \"understand\" (I tried the best I can even watch it twice to make sure I don't sound dumb) the show a little better feel free to message me",

            "content": "[Adapted From Original Blog Post]\r\nOK, I'm not ashamed, I'll admit it: I think I like Kyoto Animation's works. OK, maybe I'm a little ashamed, these are after all the same people who unleashed The Great Moe Plague of 2009 upon the anime world with the release of their smash hit K-On!, but it frustrates me that that one anime, arguably one of their weakest works, has become basically the face of the company, not only by the average anime fan, but by the studio themselves, who have incorporated the new \"moe art-style\" into nearly every anime they've produced since then. Honestly, I'm tired of KyotoAnimation being constantly represented by K-On! The reason I like them and the reason that I've been on a run of watching their anime recently is because they have shown multiple times that they are capable of so much more; and could maybe one day release something just as genre-defining as some of their works in the past, and create something really special. And while I think that today's subject: one of KyoAni's newer experiments Kyoukai no Kanata doesn't quite get there, it may be laying the ground work for something that could. \\n\\n\r\n   So if you're in the dark right now, sorry about that, I'll give a more a more depth explanation of who Kyoto Animation is and why they are important in a few sentences. But for now, hello there people of \"The Wired\", my name is Quan, I hope you are having a good day, and today we are taking about the supernatural/romance/slice-of-life adventure that is Kyoukai no Kanata, or as we say in English, Beyond the Boundary. Here we go. \\n\\n\r\nAh yes, Kyoto Animation, if you are an anime fan and have somehow not heard of this studio, allow me to quickly enlighten you. The studio first made their mark with the release of things such as Full Metal Panic and the ever popular anime The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. In this time, they also adapted various visual novels made by Key, which include Air, Kanon(2006), and of course, in my opinion, the studio's best work: Clannad and its sequel Clannad After Story. However, after K-On! put a stain on their company that will never go away no matter how bleach I use, KyoAni moved into doing things like the fairly decent romance Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!, the very good mystery show Hyouka and the awesomeness that was The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya. Now if you've seen a couple of these shows you can probably see the trend: KyoAni nearly exclusively make anime that fall more into the slice-of-life/romance genre, which is why Kyoukai no Kanata being the supernatural show that it was with only a touch of those typical elements was sort of a big deal when it first came out. Kyoukai no Kanata was directed by Taichi Ishidate, who is making his directorial debut here after working as an assistant director and the such on about literally every other KyoAni show ever, and the script was written by Jukki Hanada, who has done screenplays for things like Chobits and few episodes of the original Fate/stay night, but he has also done series composition for Kyoukai no Kanata, No Game No Life and Steins;Gate. Lastly, the anime is 12 episodes long and aired from October 3rd to December 19th in the Fall 2013 anime season. \\n\\n\r\n While taking a walk one afternoon, our protagonist Akihito Kanbara notices a girl named Mirai Kuriyama, standing on the edge of the school roof, apparently getting ready to jump. He runs up to try and tries to talk her out of it, probably not using the best choice of words, because mid-rant, Mirai does a fancy flip back onto the roof and stabs Akithito through the chest. \\n\\n\r\nIt turns out that Mirai is what's known as a Spirit World Warrior, a person obligated with the task to hunt down and kill youmu: supernatural creatures born out of the negativity constantly let off by humanity. She appears to have mistaken Akihito for a youmu, but in reality he is only half youmu and half human, and because of this is immortal. Why is Akihito is immortal is sort of left ambiguous at first, but Mirai seems to take full advantage of this fact, and over the next few weeks, stalks Akihito and attempts to kill him, despite him constantly telling her about his immortality. Once he gets her to stop stabbing him in the neck every-time they meet(in the aftermath of a chase sequence that is both awesome and hilarious), he begins to learn more about Mirai, why she has come to the town and what exactly she is trying to accomplish. Through either fate or something else, Akihito finds himself becoming more involved with Mirai, helping her get over her fear of killing youmus, and getting her settled in the town despite her clumsiness and shyness towards pretty much everything. They kill various youmus and start to learn more about each-other's pasts(for better or worse), unaware that behind the scenes of the whole society of Spirit World Warriors in the town, something else in going on, and everyone and everything is somehow involved in a plot that could potentially change the very course of nature. What you get from here is a semi-serious experience built through characters that is occasionally funny, occasionally dramatic, but also stays entertaining through classic good KyoAni writing, a good eye for chemistry, and animation that looks freakin' awesome.\\n\\n\r\n   I'm not actually quite sure what to talk about first, but I guess I'll settle on the plot structure for the series, and how Kyoukai no Kanata falls into a trap that many, many, anime before have as well. See anime as that are semi-serious such as this one like to do a certain thing, and I'll even give you a hint, it's the same thing that other supernatural shows like Shakugan no Shana, Noragami have done; they establish an over-arching story-line, but for most of the show, mess around with filler mostly used to establish character relations. And this...is fine, but the reason that works in those shows and not in this one is because of a couple of things. Firstly, Shana has the advantage of having time to spare, the anime is twice as many episodes as Kyoukai no Kanata, it has time to have this filler but also fully develop the main story. Kyoukai no Kanata desperately wants to follow this formula as well, but with the ambition of the story it tries to tell, fails to see it just doesn't have the time.\\n\\n\r\n   The story is broken into three distinct sections: The Beginning/Hollow Shadow Arc, the filler, and the Ending Arc. Now the story starts fairly strong, it establishes basic rules(if not specifics) of the supernatural with rather nice efficiency, and gives our characters depth and places to go with that depth by the end of episode 4. Speaking of episode 4, I would argue that is by far the best episode of the series, it's funny, kind of epic, and even emotional at times, and really sets up intriguing groundwork for both Mirai and Akihito's characters. However it's here where the story begins to move into filler, and where the problems start for me.\\n\\n\r\n  So actually, I'm not going to be complaining about the filler itself, because actually as far as filler goes, it is pretty great, and I still hold the episode where all the characters dress up as idols and sing a annoyingly catchy song is absolutely hilarious in just how out of place and purposely melodramatic and over-the-top it is. Besides I realize that the show still wants to be light-hearted at times, this is after all Kyoto Animation, and the story honestly did need some time to cool off after the heavy weights that episode 4 dropped. My problem with the filler is the time it takes up, because once you get to the final arc of the show, concepts are suddenly being introduced all over the place, and stops the pace of the story every time the anime needs to pause and explain something. Now the finale itself is actually quite good; but as we get closer to the end of the anime, things start getting out of hand as new concepts keep pouring in, and by the end, you're not even sure what the rules are for this world, because they keep changing. I feel like instead of having that episode about the fireworks festival they could have actually taken that time to explain some crap, instead of overstuffing the ending with explanations. But here's the worst part, and why I absolutely hate the ending of this show...is because they came so close to pulling it off. Yeah, even with all the convoluted stuff going on in the mid-to-late stages of the story, they finish it off with a kind of really effective emotional scene that challenges how much you care about Akihito and Mirai; ending on a bitter-sweet note, which if you know me, is my absolute favorite kind of ending. But literally as we enter the three minutes of the anime, Taichi Ishidate and Jukki Hanada apparently thought now was the time to literally throw all logic out the window, and say \"that's right people, the power of love can accomplish anything. Here's your happy ending. Hurrah!\". Why? You so close. It was like watching Clannad After Story all over again(which is actually another KyoAni show). Don't get me wrong, happy endings are awesome, but when  you sacrifice the narrative's integrity just for the sake of giving the viewer a happy ending, well, that's just not okay, and at the worst, is just horrible writing. I feel betrayed. So, before I get too angry, let get on with talking about the characters, and maybe find a few more good things to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nAs we turn to characters, it starts to become the argument of likability vs. complexity, the same argument I've had in my head for anime like Angel Beats and (at least for the first two season) Haruhi. I really like the cast of this anime, they are colorful and really entertaining to watch, which is nice especially when the slice-of-life aspect of the anime comes in. Too often I've learned(especially these last few days as I start my viewing of Shakugan no Shana II) that in slice-of-life shows, if the group of characters you're following doesn't have good chemistry, the show is basically screwed. It's the way that these characters can make you laugh even when they are just talking about nothing in particular that gives Kyoukai no Kanata a certain amount of charm, and even if the humor is really similar to a couple other KyoAni shows, I still had a stupid smile on my face most of the time while watching Miria, Akihito, and the others. However, no matter how much I like them, that doesn't change that talking in terms of complexity, a lot of them are 2-dimensional.\\n\\n\r\n  We'll start with our main protagonist, Akihito, and he's pretty good actually. He initially comes off a bland insert-main-protagonist who just happens to have a creepy fetish for glasses, but there's actually a lot more to him. Yes, he has a dark past that he covers up like a lot of other main characters, but it's the way Akihito(and the anime) handle this that I like. It's not so much he uses he usually cheerful and sarcastic personality to cover up his trauma, as much as he has accepted it and who he is to become a better person. I also like how we are never directly told what exactly happened in his past, which leaves us to wonder possibly could have resulted in the way he acts towards a certain thing...that is spoilers...so I'l stop talking about him now.\\n\\n\r\n    Next is our main heroine Mirai Kuriyama(nicknamed the \"bespectacled beauty\" by Akihito). She is a clumsy, somewhat introverted girl, a direct product of past truama and neglect brought own by multiple factors. She is special even among Spirit World Warriors, being the last surviving member of a clan which processed the ability of being able to shape their blood and use it as a weapon against youmu, a power which is generally regarded as cursed. I think I like Mirai as a character(especially when she's interacting with Akihito which are easily the funniest parts of the anime), she has the \"cute-factor\" that all KyoAni heroines must absolutely have, but it's the way she interacts with her environment which is the best. Also, despite being timid, she's not a pushover, and as you learn throughout the anime, she can be unbelievably strong, kind or bad-ass when she wants to. And that's awesome.\\n\\n\r\n   And as much as I like those two and their relationship and how it progresses throughout the anime, the rest of the cast don't have a lot to them really. Mitsuki Nase is the daughter of a wealthy family of Spirit World Warriors and Akihito's childhood friend, but despite having a sharp tongue and some funny lines and interactions throughout the anime, she ultimately doesn't get any development, which is disappointing considering how much I liked her at first. Her brother Hiroomi Nase isn't much better, being pretty much completely defined by his little sister complex, and even though I'm pretty sure that is just a giant joke for him, that doesn't help his character much. He has some good interactions with Akihito, but that's all I can say.\\n\\n\r\n   How to put this... the world seems almost empty. Kyoukai no Kanata has a fair amount of interesting characters, like Ayaka or Izumi, but when you get down to it we really don't learn much about them, even though it feels like there is more to know. Even the villain we get down the line is pretty lame, basically just being a psychotic jerk who wants to blow up the world. And that's disappointing really. You're teased with so much with the series, what is going on, what could potentially be going on, and while most questions are answered, some are just left dangled in the air, hinting on what might be. Hopefully, if a sequel ever does happen(and I do want it to), it'll start to expand on this supernatural world and answer those bigger questions, because even though the show takes place in a single town, if the scale gets bigger I think it would be a good thing. Such concepts, like The Society of Spirit World Warriors and where exactly those gems they get from the youmu are going, could be explored, and really give the show some backbone and places to go.\\n\\n\r\nKyoAni's animation has always been really good, but sometimes it's easy to downplay that since all they usually ever have to animate is school kids sitting around a table, walking around, or going to the beach, but not with this anime. Kyoukai no Kanata is first and foremost an action show, and let's just say I can't downplay anything anymore. It is awesome. From exciting choreography to cool powers, to fights of Kyoukai no Kanata are usually a spectacle to behold. It's not even just the fluid animation of them, it's the supernatural aesthetic that KyoAni have added that really makes the show pop. Seriously, even when two blades connect and there is a shower of sparks, it always is just cool to look at. Even moving away from what the aesthetic adds to the fighting to how all the supernatural elements are designed, through a use of bright colors and the interesting ways the supernatural is integrated into the world. When no fighting or supernatural stuff is going on however, the animation is still quite good, and I think the attention to detail is a big part of it. For instance, at one point when Akihito is sitting Mitsuki in the club-room(they are in a club by the way) silently and being bored, he flips through the pages of a closed book, and I thought that was just really nice. Also how the characters emote while talking with each-other adds another layer of funny and wit to their conversations. Turning to the other side of the spectrum, lighting and backgrounds, while not bad, never really impressed me. I kind of think that is nitpicking though, and while I do pride myself as a nitpicker, without dragging on too long, the animation for the show is really damn good, and if nothing else, you'll get a lot of awesome fight scenes from the show against a backdrop of good supernatural design and typical KyoAni detailing. Enough said. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I think of Kyoukai no Kanata's soundtrack, the word \"thumbnail\" comes to mind. The songs you see the most of, the OP and the ED are quite good, but besides from those two the OST really doesn't have a lot going for it. With music done by Masumi Ito, who you might know from OST's such as I.S Infinite Stratos and Scrapped Princess, no song really stands out. They keep the supernatural and mystical theme well enough, but unfortunately I can't really make any other comments since I actually haven't listened to the OST in awhile since it is unavailable everywhere I looked. Though, I think the very fact that I didn't remember anything is proof enough that nothing is particularly good. So, yes, the OP (also titled \"Kyoukai no Kanata\") by Minori Chihara is quite lovely, she has an amazing voice to begin with, but the song is catchy as well as the video that accompanies it gorgeously animated. However, if I were to choose a favorite song from the soundtrack, it would be the ED: \"Daisy\" by the band STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION would be it. The song is slow and calming, which usually isn't my thing, but the variety of the emotions it captures is really powerful. Besides, the scenery of the ED is awesome as well...those colors. \\n\\n\r\nSo the question remains. Did Kyoukai no Kanata, the newest experiment by Kyoto Animation, beat the odds and become actually good despite the studio's inexperience in the genre? Well, I hate to be vague, but yes and no. Yes, taken at face value, despite having awesome animation and being entertaining, the anime isn't the best in terms of plot or characters, even going to other shows of the genre to find something better isn't that hard. However, if anything, I don't think Kyoukai no Kanata is a sign that Kyoto Animation should just stay in their moe-blob fortress of solitude for all eternity, in fact it's quite the opposite. There's potential here, and as I said in the beginning of the review, Kyokai no Kanata is laying the groundowrk for something bigger, the equivalent of dipping your toe in the water to see how cold it is. The answer is that it's cold, but it won't take long for you to get used to it. Listen, Kyoto Animation has a group of great writers, now I think all they need is the right thing to adapt, and they could make something special. Something that needn't even be all slice-of-life and of moe either, something legitimately good. And yeah, I know I'm day-dreaming over here, but hell, at least there's now a reason to dream. So for now, let's look to the future of this studio and this anime. It's looking awfully awesome. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 6(.5)/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor this review and others, feel free to check out my blog! (Link on profile)\\n",

This show made me go \"Whuuuuut?!\" in only first two minutes, after that I was in!\r\nThe story of gifted young lady, who happens to be Spirit Warrior with unusual powers, that run in her family. She can use her blood to form a weapon or incapacitate her opponents. However, she is last of her family and is considered to be cursed. When she meets Akihito, who turns out to be kinda immortal due to his mom being a demon, things are gonna change. And we all hopethat for the better.\\n\\n\r\nThis action supernatural  romantic comedy, apart from being really nicely drawn, has good comedy, impressive action scenes and interesting mythology. Suspence and plot twist will get you, and you will root for the main couple, if you are a fan of the genre... of any of the genre included. \\n\r\nMy personal favourite, is the episode, where they are hunting the paranoid leaky spirit on the roof. It is hillarious! \\n\\n\r\nAnime is mainly focused on characters, so If you expect lot of action... you might be satisfied, but it really isn't the main theme here. I have to point pout great soundtrack, too. Opening and ending song were bound to end up on my mp3 player almost from the fisrt time I heard them. Also original music for the show is beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThere you go! Kyoukai no Kanata might bw one of many pieces of this specific genre so familliar to any anime enthusiast. But it is in many ways outstanding anime. I highly recommend it.",

            "content": "Kyokai no Kanata could have been more than a 7/10. Don't get me wrong it's still fine, but it could have had been something more than an OK anime. Sadly it falls short. In my opinion there are two major flaws that hold it down and I am gonna explain them briefly.\r\nBut let me start with the good stuff. The story starts off pretty nicely and catches  your interest as it is surrounded by mystery. The characters are definately the strongest point of Kyokai no Kanata toghether with its visuals. All the protagonists are enjoyable to watch and have nice traits that make themdistinct and not soulless and mainstream. Scenes of humour and seriousness coexist in harmony. The action is stunning with epic battles that take advantage of the beautiful visuals.\\n\\n\r\nNow the two weaknesses of the anime are the following:\\n\r\nFirstly it's pretty short. 12 episodes isn't enough for what KnK is trying to achieve. The world with the spirits and the spirit warriors which it is trying to present is lacking and many things remain unexplained or can be expanded on.\\n\r\nSecondly, in my opinion KnK's greatest flaw is its ending. Seriously, it's really bad. I am not gonna spoil anything but let me say that in the last 4 episodes nothing gets explained, random stuff happens for no apparent reason, we are not given any information about the antagonist, like what happens to him or what were his motives and in the final couple of minutes there is also a cheap surprise which is also not explained but they just put it in there for a happier ending I guess...\\n\\n\r\nAll in all KnK is a pretty good action anime with comedic elements that manages not to fall victim  of any of the current trends (harem, fanservice...) and create something unique and enjoyable. Had its ending been decent it would definately get a 9/10 from me.",

            "content": "The setting of Beyound the Boundary is really simple: There are monsters and guys that kill monsters. The comedy is created from the character traits of the cast: The protagonist really, really likes girls with glasses, the girl who tries to kill him is a shy girl with glasses. The best friend of the protagonist is really, really obsessed with his little sister, so they fantasize together about the little sister and what she would look like with glasses. This style of comedy is very simple, but at least not terrible. Beyond the boundary manages to at least write comedy that makes sense from whatwe know about the characters, for example when the poor girl with glasses sells pictures of her to a anonymous buyer with the initials of the protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nBut the comedy is not the main focus of the story. After episode 6, an episode that only consists of the friends fighting a monster that can be distracted by scantily dressed, singing girls, the story begins to speed up, but also gets worse to the end. That is the biggest problem of the show, it's not a bad show, but it is wasting its potential. The ending has a long emotional buildup, only to destroy the point of the whole fight and story in the last thirty seconds.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are characters written for comedy. They have one or two defining character traits and have only little character development. We learn about their backstories and their motivations, but they never become really complex characters. That being said, the love for glasses of the protagonist is a funny idea, it's different to the normal love for little sisters or other questionalble likings, not that they don't exist in this show. The good thing about the characters is that they all are connected, no character is there for no real reason. \\n\\n\r\nOf of the biggest selling points is certainly the amazing animation, the fighting scenes are fluid and nice to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSure, good animation alone can't save an otherwise bad show, but Beyond the Boundary is not a bad show, it's better than most shows I watched. It's just sad that there is so much wasted potential.",

            "content": "Britt: Wow. It's been awhile since I reviewed an anime, huh? Well, if you've seen my other reviews (or any of \"our\" reviews for that matter) then you know the drill. If not then, let me just say that my reviews aren't spoiler free. If you plan on watching this anime, I suggest NOT reading my review.\r\nI started working on this before finishing the anime, at around episode 8. I of course finished it before making my final conclusion on the show, but I just thought I'd mention that.\r\nStory (taken from MAL):\r\n\"Mirai Kuriyama is the sole survivor of a clan of Spirit World warriors withthe power to employ their blood as weapons. As such, Mirai is tasked with hunting down and killing \"youmu\"\u2014creatures said to be the manifestation of negative human emotions. One day, while deep in thought on the school roof, Mirai comes across Akihito Kanbara, a rare half-breed of youmu in human form. In a panicked state, she plunges her blood saber into him only to realize that he's an immortal being. From then on, the two form an impromptu friendship that revolves around Mirai constantly trying to kill Akihito, in an effort to boost her own wavering confidence as a Spirit World warrior. Eventually, Akihito also manages to convince her to join the Literary Club, which houses two other powerful Spirit World warriors, Hiroomi and Mitsuki Nase.\\n\\n\r\nAs the group's bond strengthens, however, so does the tenacity of the youmu around them. Their misadventures will soon turn into a fight for survival as the inevitable release of the most powerful youmu, Beyond the Boundary, approaches.\"\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely adore Kyoto Animation, and they usually do slice of life shows (or if they do something supernatural, it usually ends up being slice-of-life in the end.) So it's safe to say that I thought it'd be pretty cool if they stepped outta their comfort zone and made a more \"Sc-Fi\" and \"dark\" anime full of monsters and whatnot. This show was even recommended to me awhile ago (and I mean, AWHILE ago.) But I put it off till recently. I was...a little bit disappointed with this anime to say the least. I didn't hate this anime, but it could've been way better than it was. I just think it was average. \\n\\n\r\n-Episode 6 was freaking weird. It was funny (probably the funniest the show could be.) But it just seemed so random and unnecessary. \\n\\n\r\n-The \"Hollow Shadow\" seemed like it'd be more important than it was, yet it was defeated in about 2 or 3 episodes,. That was...anti climactic. I mean, they mentioned it a few more times later on in the series, but they kinda hyped it up to be something that would take awhile to defeat, and that isn't what happened.\\n\\n\r\n-I get confused when they say \"youmu\", because I immediately think of Youmu Konpaku from Touhou: Project. I feel like...if they said \"youkai\" instead of \"youmu\", I'd be less confused by what they were talking about. They're the same thing technically, aren't they?\\n\\n\r\nThose were just little \"nitpicks\" that I had. Overall, the story was nothing phenomenal. We find out that Mirai was told by Izumi Nase to destroy \"Beyond the Boundary\", which....I honestly thought was just the title of the anime. I didn't think it was an actual thing that needed to be \"destroyed\". We also find out that Akihito Kanbara is in fact \"Beyond the Boundary\", and Mirai didn't really defeat him. He actually kinda just played punchies with himself till he broke into a million pieces in the last episode (literally.) Speaking of Akihito, let's move onto the characters!\\n\r\nOh, I'd probably give the story on average a 6 out of 10. It was just \"meh\" to me. Some things were left unexplained (like Izumi having a youmu inside of her apparently, or the fact that Aki's mom f*cked a youmu and had Aki....but why?)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe main characters are: Mirai Kuriyama, Akihito Kanbara, Mitsuki Nase, and Hirromi Nase. I didn't really...care for any of them, except maybe Mirai (but that's only because I thought her powers were cool and she has a cute character design.) I know people watching were probably annoyed by Mirai's constant \"how unpleasant\" catchphrase (or if you watched it in Japanese: \"Fuyukai Desu\".) And I was too. But you wanna know what annoyed me even more than that? Akihito's weird as hell glasses fetish and Hiroomi's creepy as hell obsession with his damn sister. Speaking of Aki's glasses fetish, I don't think he actually liked Mirai as a person, but only because of her damn glasses! (And I seem to recall Ayaka saying that Mitsuki was Hiroomi's \"older sister\" in one episode, which was odd as it was never mentioned again. (I forget which episode it was, but I think it was after Mirai defeated the Hollow Shadow and Aki went all crazy because he's half youmu n junk. It might've just been a mistake by the dub team though, unless I just heard her wrong. Which I'm pretty sure I did.)) But still, I found Akihito and Hiroomi annoying perverts most of the time. I don't think Aki and Mirai had a lot chemistry, either. OK, they were both \"ashamed\" of their \"cursed\" blood, so they felt they were the same in some way or another, and Aki gave Mirai money sometimes to pay for food and her rent, but other than that I really TRULY feel like Aki only liked Mirai because she wore glasses! Are those really enough reasons to fall in love with each other? Maybe if it was more than 12 episodes and Aki didn't constantly shout out his weird obsession with glasses, than MAYBE I'd understand why they fell in love with each other, but that wasn't the case. And Mirai specifically told him that she was supposed to kill him, and when she decided not to, there were consequences. She gave up her life so that he could live, so when \"Beyond the Boundary\" went back into Aki's body for whatever reason (after he literally played \"punchies\" with it and it disintegrated) her body started to disappear. Yet \"by the power of their love for each other!\" Mirai MAGICALLY reappears. Because, why the hell not?? So yeah. The romance was also pretty...sucky. You wanna know what anime couples I think had good chemistry? Taiga and Ryuuji from Toradora!, Nagisa and Tomoya from CLANNAD, and hell, I think Kurisu and Okabe from Steins;Gate had better chemistry. They should've been left at \"just friends.\" Onto another character here we have Hiroomi Nase. Yeah. Hiroomi is just freaking weird. He was spying on his younger sister in a bikini. Because Japan just thinks incest is the best form of entertainment, right? Other than that, it seems the Nase family members all have the same bland, and boring personalities anyway. The only thing that really stands out is Hiroomi and his sister complex that actually makes me uncomfortable (and the fact that he acts gay sometimes for....whatever reason.) Other than that, they don't stand out much. The oldest sister Izumi seemed too bossy and b*tchy for my liking at first. But she was kinda bland, too. And we find out that she has a secret she's been keeping from her family, but we never learn anymore about it cause the series just like....ends after that. Mitsuki is also just an \"OK\" character. She didn't seem to do much. There's also another character named Sakura (forgot her last name.) But...I didn't understand the point of her character. Mirai was adopted, and Sakura was her adopted little sister. But when Mirai was forced to kill Sakura's biological sister because she was possessed, Sakura swore revenge on her. But...Sakura forgave Mirai rather quickly. It seems it didn't take much to convince her that Mirai wasn't a bad person, especially since she seemed so dead-set on killing her. A simple \"I'm sorry\" seems to have worked in Mirai's favor, and I thought that was stupid. Sakura's introduction into the damn show was \"I gotta kill Mirai cause she killed my sister\", then all Mirai had to do was say \"I'm sorry\" once, and they suddenly become best friends who even start living together? That's stupid! The other characters are....meh to me as well. The main 4 aren't all that memorable, except Mirai. But I'm pretty sure she's only \"memorable\" because of her catchphrase. Aki's mom was weird just for the sake of being weird (I mean obviously. She f*cked \"Beyond the Boundary\".) The teacher was alright, but I forgot her name and she just seemed to be there cause she wanted a boyfriend. The villain was kinda lame and I don't remember his name, either. Ms. Ayaka and Ai were probably the only characters I can say I \"cared about\". Even then, I still didn't care. \\n\r\nThe characters were OK. I'd probably have to give them a 6 out of 10 as well. They were just kind of forgettable. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: \\n\r\nWell, KyoAni is known for having really awesome art and a really awesome animation style. So as per usual, it was pretty great here too. The fight scenes were cool, and nothing really seemed \"off\" in the animation. It had pretty colors, bt they weren't \"all in your face.\" When it needed to be dark it was dark, and vice versa. The character designs were hit or miss. Mirai, Ms. Ayaka, and Ai were probably designed the best, while the rest of em were a bit plain. I looked passed that, though. So no complaints about the art/animation. I'd give it an 8 out of 10. As for the sound,  I watched this anime dubbed (as I tend to do quite often), and the only voice that seemed like an odd choice was Mitsuki's. I like Monica Rial, but I feel like she wasn't a very good choice for this particular character. But to be perfectly honest, I think Funimation just reeeeally wants to use the most of her. I feel like she's in almost every anime I've watched, whether her voice needs to be there or not (like Tara Strong with American cartoons.) She was even in RWBY, and she played a character that got killed off in her one and only appearance! What was the point of that?? Aside from Mitsuki's voice, I think everyone else's voice was fine. Mirai's was annoying, but I got used to it and it kinda fit, so the voice acting was fine. As for the music, it's another hit or miss. The opening called \"Kyoukai no Kanata\" by Minori Chihara was nothing to write home about. It fit the anime, but it's not a song I'd want to hear multiple times or want to download/buy. I didn't skip the song though, because I was watching the anime on a site with a tremendous amount of ads, and I thought I'd mess something up if I skipped the OP. So that's the only reason I bothered listening to it. It's not a \"bad\" song, just not an amazing one either. As for the ending song called \"Daisy\" by STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION (I think), it was actually really catchy to me. Now THAT'S a song I wouldn't mind listening to more than once. The visuals in both the OP and ED are very good, though. As for background music, I liked that as well. I think they all fit the scenes they were in. So the sound department gets a 7.5 out of 10 for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment:\\n\r\nAfter remembering the \"Endless 8\" from Haruhi when I recommended it to someone, I remembered my frustration with that arc in an otherwise amazing anime. So I decided to look at forum posts to see how other people felt about it. I was mostly on Reddit, and I noticed another person mention that they did not enjoy the Endless 8 either, and that they apparently saw something that talked about KyoAni's \"worst\" anime (or something along those lines) so far. Apparently \"Kyoukai no Kanata\" was the worst anime that they've produced as far as that goes (that Reddit post was 10 months ago.) I haven't seen EVERY Kyoto Animation out there, but....Kyoukai no Kanata isn't terrible, I just feel like it could've been way better than it was. I mean, other than the beautiful, glistening muscles in \"Free! Iwatobi Swim Club\", I thought that show was pretty boring so I dropped it (not even the hawt guys could keep me invested.) And I think I started \"K-ON!\" along time ago, but I don't remember it being that great either so....Kyoukai no Kanata shouldn't be considered \"the worst\". At least, I don't think it should be. (Here's the Reddit post in case anyone is curious: www.reddit.com/r/anime/comment\u2026. The comment is near the bottom, left by someone named \"OseiTheWarrior\".) I somewhat enjoyed this show. I'm thinking maybe if it was longer to explain certain things better, than the show itself might also be better. The characters and music are hit or miss, and the story itself was kinda \"subpar.\" In conclusion, this show isn't \"terrible\", it's just average. That's probably the best I can give it. Would I recommend this show? Well, if you like pretty animation and you're bored and wanna watch something short, than go for it. I don't think it's KyoAni's \"worst\" anime, but it's definitely not one of their bests.\\n\r\nSo I'd say my enjoyment out of the whole thing is a 7, which isn't too bad a rating.",

            "content": "Kyoukai no Kanata strikes me as a classed-up counterpart to Love, Chuunibyo & Other Delusions: light entertainment resting on pillars of cute characters, enlivened by the prospect of romance between two improbable candidates amidst supernatural mischief, wracked by a story insufficiently cultivated and a world insufficiently explored, plagued by inferior writing and tepid humor; animated and directed with the assiduous attention to punctilios that has become the bread and butter of Kyoto Animation, but anchored to the dramatic language of light novels.  \r\nThe male protagonist, Akihito Kanbara, lives an ordinary, unoccupied life in which he demonstrates no depth beyond the basic running gagmaterial, in this case a megane moe and a mortifying mother.  Only a tumultuous past and supernatural abilities (real, at least, compared to Chuunibyou) distinguish him from the extras.  Likewise, the female protagonist, Mirai Kuriyama, is a phenomenon of adorable magnetism in every respect, but beyond her own tumultuous past and supernatural abilities, the dominating aspect of her personality is \"dojikko,\" with a healthy dose of social anxiety and naive vulnerability to ensure that she will not drive the plot any more than Kanbara.  Our supporting cast features such genre staples as the single teacher who can't get a man, the reptilian siscon upperclassman who looks like he should be voiced by Hiroshi Kamiya, and the loli who\u2019s actually an ageless demon.  Mitsuki Nase escapes the pigeonholing relatively unscathed - the Naoko Yamada-directed episode 5 in particular allows us to glimpse a layer underneath her surface personality that makes her seem more human than her companions - but she still lacks the narrative importance to pull the story away from its mediocre tendencies.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing is a strange blend of explication and implication, a testament to the risks of tackling fantasy world-building in the same register as a teen comedy; episodes that in one moment communicate an important concept through succinct visual means will in the next run the gamut of expository dialogue, hanging context out to dry with a parade of \"as you and I both know\"s and \"like I already said\"s.  Tedious, clumsy humor bogs down the slice-of-life scenes; while some jokes could be rescued with tighter timing, a quicker trigger, and some general sharpening - lessons from a gag anime would do wonders - far too often the punchlines are labored and predictable, quickly draining the fun from the exchange.  This show has only so many jokes in its arsenal and rarely ventures beyond scenarios set up in the first episode, remaining willfully ignorant of the fact that character traits exist to create depth and not to propagate memes.  Some of the more egregious aspects of the show's writing and tone evaporate as the story moves into its final act, only to be undercut by slippery pacing and the full bloom of the undercooked conflict.  Mirai's dazzling acrobatics are almost TOO fluid; she slides from attack to attack in a display of animating acumen that is thrilling to watch but does nothing to explain the stakes or parameters of the action, and once the various battles have sped to their finales in those last couple of episodes, it is difficult to explain what exactly has happened and why.  The show drops hints about its endgame in several earlier episodes, but when the last quarter suddenly unveils the deciding conflict, events move so quickly and with so little accumulated momentum that the resolution doesn't feel real when it arrives, and the shower of pathos certainly doesn't feel earned.  The finale truly feels detached from anything the story has been driving towards, such that the absolute deus ex machina with which the series tips its hat doesn't rankle me in the slightest: whatever the show wants, I will allow, for the logic behind every aspect of the scenario eludes me equally. \\n\\n\r\nCombine these compositional missteps with a level of risque fan service that is somewhat unusual for Kyoto Animation - whose own brand of audience pandering typically aims for the kawaii-moe-uguu bracket rather than simple titillation - and Beyond the Boundary comes out feeling not only unfulfilling but mildly distasteful.  From a studio with such high standards, in a project staffed by such creative talent, applied to characters with such potential, it's hard not to find Beyond the Boundary terribly disappointing.  I have become accustomed to much more personal and well-considered content from Kyoto Animation. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 6, the \u201cidol episode,\u201d perfectly exemplifies the show\u2019s greatest flaws.  In between an episode that grasps the fragility of the characters with tender understanding and an episode that examines Mirai\u2019s traumatic past comes a ramshackle space-filler drastically at odds with the material surrounding it.  The ridiculous premise itself doesn\u2019t bother me \u2013 the central performance is well animated, nicely choreographed, and accompanied by a catchy song.  I won't trouble over a hasty excuse to get the characters into an improbable getup in most cases.  The writing again proves to be an Achilles heel, however; the dialogue is peppered with riff after riff on the same exhausted catchphrases to the greatest extent of all, and the explanation of this bizarre conceit arrives so clumsily that it strains to the point of failure any good will that might have been built up over previous episodes.  Had the idol concept been a tighter gag couched in a broader world-building episode instead of a pathetically transparent attempt to exploit the show's fan service potential as much as possible, had the writing pursued some new comedic ideas instead of falling back on old standards that weren't funny the first time, had this episode done something, anything at all, to bridge the tonal gap between the two episodes that bookend it instead of completely ignoring the show's development, there could have been something here; it still would have sat in an awkward place between two relatively personal and weighty episodes and, truthfully, might not have been worth salvaging at all, but it would have been fine.  It is instead an example of Beyond the Boundary at its worst: bypassing the untapped strength of its characters and world to prostitute its own potential for cheap, superficial appeal. \\n\\n\r\nNarrative and conceptual flaws aside, Beyond the Boundary excels as an aesthetic work; with its mouth-watering fight scenes, consistently perfect lighting, and gorgeous colors, it ranks among Kyoto Animation's most impressive works of animation to date.  In fact, the ED animation, occasional gentle tone, and spellbinding, cinematic visuals present here flourished in Taichi Ishidate's next directorial project, Violet Evergarden, which holds the crown at present (among series, anyway).  Even the sumptuous color palette described by the episode titles is a sensory treat; truthfully, I could stare for hours at the Blu-ray menu's lash of black/pink text over an orange sunset scene with Minori Chihara's distinctive mellow voice crooning out the enrapturing OP - I've probably spent more time sitting in the show's ambiance that way than actually watching it.  I love that feeling and I know that this show is capable of recreating this atmosphere on a series-wide scale.  Ishidate's attention to small personal details and typically insightful character animation bolster the sense that the series is a lot smarter when it doesn't open its mouth.  KnK is cute, no doubt - Mirai and her counterparts certainly succeed there, if nowhere else - but unrewarding outside its stylish dressing and disappointing for how its core fails to live up to that creative splendor.  The day may come when that style becomes enough for me; there are some excellent individual episodes, it's true, and the series is usually entertaining at the very least, so I know for a fact that I will be watching it again and I don't regret spending money on it.  Still, I never thought I'd rate a Kyoto Animation show so low, but wanting a show to be good, and even enjoying it in spite of its flaws, does not make it good.",

            "content": "tl;dr/possible spoiler warning!\r\nOnce again i had no concept of what i was about to watch. In fact the only real reason i watched it was because i wanted something pretty to look at and in that category at least it did not disappoint.\r\nSo while watching Kyoukai i had a fair amount of times i just lost focus on the show for some reason. The story was interesting enough and it was easy on the eyes as well, but i think the reason was that id seen it done before many times and i kinda was bored with what to expect i think. That is notto say its a less than a good show, that is why I'm giving it a 7. I think at the time i was just coming off better story driven shows with better characters.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters lets do a quick over view of them. The main characters are, in my opinion, all kinda unlikable. The heroines catchphrase was pretty strange and didn't add anything to her character at all. She was just a glasses girl who happens to be the main heroine. And dont worry because The main hero will repeatedly let you know that shit. Trust me that got old fast as fuck. The only characters i would want to know more about would be the older sister character and the hero's mother but other than that idgaf really.\\n\\n\r\nBasically half-ish of all the episodes is just little sister and glasses fetish innuendo and shit like that. They weren't clever or well delivered or anything so i just got bored with the \"comedy\" of the show after ep. 1. The romance was kinda ehhh... but ill let that slide because thats not really what the show was about. The fight scenes looked nice but as far as cool choreography or inner mental struggles it didn't stand out at all. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, if you want to watch an average/slightly above average show with nice art and good sound complemented by a great end and op theme then look no further kids!! But for real it was probably better than i am giving it credit in some areas, like i said i couldn't keep focus because it couldn't suck me in sometimes. And a problem like that will vary person to person based on their tastes, so if you think it looks cool just go for it. I doubt it will be a waste of your time but neither will it give a lasting expression i think. The movie might make it tie together well, so i might change this after the movie. Although the movie will have to be pretty damn good for me to have this go up even one point.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts: Don't watch the dub on this one. I usually go for the dubs because its slightly easier to focus and I'm not language elitist like some, but good god are the chicks voices cancerous on this one. Especially the main bitch. Sub this one or get ear cancer, your choice.",

            "content": "Beware that I'm writing this review right after I watched the entire series. Even still, I'll do my best to not let my enjoyment of this show fool me into saying things that aren't true for me.\r\nThe best way to describe \"Kyoukai no Kanata\", or as it is called in English, \"Beyond The Boundary\" is using the phrase: \"Some lovestories are greater than other\". If you haven't watched the show, you'll probably be confused, as this show is included in the supernatural/fantasy genre.\r\n\"Kyoukai no Kanata\" has a great premise, but it did made me a fool by hiding what it actually is. Regardless of that,it didn't disappoint me.\\n\\n\r\nTHE STORY: 8 OUT OF 10\\n\\n\r\nThe story is quite simple, but due to the show's directing, it can be really confusing, specially at the beginning. Let's just say that you should pay attention, and if you don't understand something, you should go back and repeat the scene or dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there, you'll notice that this anime has 2 main \"parts\": the first one is the supernatural one, in which the show deals with the plot that is about the supernatural elements the anime possesses. The second one is the romantic side of the show, in which the main focus is the 2 main characters.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I enjoyed both parts of the show, and therefore I give it an 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS: 7 OUT OF 10\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters seem to be portrayed as some kind of abnormal beings, that don't act like humans; however, they all act like complete human beings, even if they do have some kind of supernatural power.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also characters that only offer comic relief to the show, but I did not thing that the character development was boring or stupid. Beyond that, thanks to the animation, all the characters are extremely cute and/or hot. Oh, and as a gay guy, Akihito and Hiromi? I ship it.\\n\\n\r\nI think that the main reason people say that they didn't like the characters, is because of the big difference from their actions and they portrayal, as even though they are portrayed as different from humans, they always act like them. Some may like this or not, I guess it depends if you like the slice of life genre or not.\\n\\n\r\nTHE SOUND AND ANIMATION: 10 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nFor the first time in forever, I payed attention to the music of a show, and I didn't get mad about it. Not much to say about the music.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, about the animation... OH MY GOD. First of all, just know that even though the plot and character might have flaws, the animation is completely outstanding. The battle scenes are epic, and if you're going to watch this show, watch it on 1080p... You'll thank me later.\\n\\n\r\n| THE DIRECTING | The plot has potential, yes... But due to the directing of the show, the beginning is extremely confusing. When you reach the half way point, you'll get used to it, like I did... But I did want to give up on this show because of the mess it seemed to be.\\n\\n\r\n| THE COMEDY | Did I enjoy the sixth episode of the show? Yes I did, but the comic relief seemed forced and extremely unnecessary at some times. There were times I really laughed, and sometimes I would just be like... Really? The show pulls out comedy in moments that should be darker, and it kinda ruins those particular moments. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7 OUT OF 10\\n\\n\r\nWhen I realized that \"Kyoukai no Kanata\" was something completely different of what I expected, I got a little bit skeptical... And because of the messy beginning, I also wanted to give up on the show. Well, I'm glad I didn't.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there, even though I only gave the show a 7 out of 10, I do recommend you to watch it, as it is quite good, specially if you like the slice of life genre.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and if you didn't like this review...\\n\r\nHow unpleasant.",

            "content": "Since I don't have enough time to binge watch an anime nowadays due to my full time daddy duties, it has become more difficult for me to choose an anime to invest on watching.\r\nKyoukai no Kanata (Beyond the Boundary) is somewhat of a surprise for me since I just instinctively wanted to watch it after seeing a few moments of its episode 1 on youtube.\r\nThis bespectacled beauty stabbing this young man right through his heart when he is supposed to be helping prevent her from attempting a suicide dive from the building is definitely an impact image from my perspective. And that is only first1-2 minutes of the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the 12 main episodes of Kyoukai no Kanata, I strongly appreciate how the story does not waste any time to get to it's main points. Which was both good and bad for me.\\n\\n\r\nThere was a point in one of the episodes that I felt I've been watching this story for a long time (which is good), and there were also times where I stopped and talked to myself \"how did it jumped from this intense action and drama to a jpop dance routine!?\". \\n\\n\r\nBut the strange thing was, it did not feel wrong or forced. It felt really familiar, like looking through a room full of memories contained in specific frames per section.\\n\r\nThe characters are really flushed out that every one of them really stands out on their own.\\n\\n\r\nI am biased on two specific characters since they hit a chord in my otaku heart: the heroine Kuriyama Mirai and calm and collected Izumi Nase.\\n\\n\r\nThe bespectacled beauty that is Kuriyama combined with her funny quirks and down to her cute mannerisms are golden! I can relate to the protagonist of the story, Akihito on the way he reacts and feels whenever Kuriyama is being Kuriyama. Evey word he says is also a spot on description of what I feel with Kuriyama's character.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Izumi Nase's strong intimidating presence contained in her calm demeanor keeps me glued to every scene she appears in. And I truly love her during the scene where that calmness and collected persona of her was wavering and it showed her hidden vulnerable side.\\n\\n\r\nThe last 3 episodes of Kyoukai no Kanata showed it's true strength which lies on love, sacrifice and choice that Kuriyama and Akihito exchanged especially in these last episodes. \\n\\n\r\nTruly, the ending scene was uplifting and and what I want to personally see in the finale.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I am giving it a 9/10. \u4e0d\u6109\u5feb\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3059!

            "content": "Honestly, I truly hated this anime. I found it tolerable up until roughly episode 9 or 10, when the plot completely dissolved. In many ways, I feel that this show was attempting something similar to Puella Magi Madoka Magica, but it lacked any of the character development, depth, or finesse. \r\nThe protagonist, Mirai Kuriyama, was a very unlikable character for me. She lacks basic logic and reasoning in such a way where her decisions come off as poorly disguised plot devices. Her actions don't make any real sense and there is no explanation offered. Even her backstory falls flat: we're given surface level info abouther clan, but it's never developed. We learn about her friend, but it's not really her fault and doesn't add anything except for another boring illogical guilt plot. (Why do anime characters love to say they murdered someone who died in unfortunate circumstances near them??) Not to mention that in the dub, Kuriyama's voice actor is UNBEARABLE. She speaks at such a high pitch that it's extremely irritating and distracting. Akihito was more compelling, although definitely not perfect. Most of the other characters were simply alright because they never received any attention beyond the basics. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the plot makes a total loop on itself where it creates a poorly executed and faux-dramatic ending which then unravels itself completely so that none of its actions have any effect. There is no change between the beginning and end of the season except for the perception of the Nase Izumi. It is wholly unsuccessful in 1) making anything happen or change and 2) explaining why the plot was happening in the first place. Why was Fujima trying to accomplish what he was? Did his actions even do anything in the end? What was the point of any of these developments?? It attempted to create a dark and final ending in the way that PMMM was able to, but lacked the conviction to stick with it (most likely so that it could continue on with another season). \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, I hated this anime, nothing was accomplished, the characters were shoddy, the protagonist was annoying and unlikable, and the plot was poorly written and executed. It wasn't that bad to watch at first, but when it was time for the plot to pick up, it totally failed to meet the occasion.",

            "content": "/////THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nFirst review! yays\r\nI decided to write this review as of episode 6, the point at which I lost all interest I had in this anime. This thing is one of the most frustrating things I've ever watched, and it's closely battling with \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\" for the first place in the category of worst anime I've somehow managed to finish. And I will elaborate my opinions as it follows, one part at a time.\r\nStory: 2/10 \r\nI am going to do something that the creators of KnK were unable to accomplish in what concerns the storyline, which is explaining things. Idon't even know where to begin with this.\\n\r\nThe plot? Where the fuck is it? Plot holes are one thing, but this is ridiculous. I was too angry trying to understand why what is happening is happening instead of enjoying the kind of overused but fairly potent overall concept of this anime. It had so many \"BECAUSE ANIME\" moments, I had to take up a notebook at episode 6 and start writing them down. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime was so uninteresting it became the handsfree activity I would do while eating, rather than the show you would grab food to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThat one filler episode with the fruit monster who squirted smelly juice kept me alert, nonetheless. What. The. Fuck. This episode was a big fuck-up by content, but the ending was striving for cheap old american sitcom endings where the characters get dragged back into the humorous but troublesome situation due to their collective stupidity which only adds to the comedic effect.  Ha. Ha. No. \\n\r\nAnd who needs a filler for a 12 episode anime? Comedy was trying to be shoved in by force anyway and the behaviour of the characters was just questionable. \\n\r\nHere's a selection of these \"thought-inducing\" BECAUSE ANIME scenes:\\n\r\n-at some point, the water in the sewers two characters were fighting in caught fire BECAUSE ANIME\\n\r\n-main girl finds STACKS of albums with photos of her in the main dude's apartment but also finds a hint for her upcoming birthday present that would clearly only feed the guy's maniacal glasses fetish but still, she is stricken by romance, completely disregarding the creepiness BECAUSE ANIME\\n\r\n-main dude aggressively rides the scooter through the snow, on a background of unfitting battle music\\n\\n\r\nAt episode 11, I could have stopped watching it and everything would have been fine, because the focus was so heavy on the romance between the two, the plot and the existence of the other characters were actually ditched completely. It really did feel like the anime ended right there. Which would have made the series better, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10 \\n\r\nThe design does look pretty but nothing unusual, really. Too pretty and \"slice of life\" for what it's trying to be, in my opinion.\\n\r\nThe animation is mediocre, except for that one episode where they randomly included motion-capture for the dance of the characters. Not very aesthetic.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nMediocre. Mediocre. Mediocre. Sometimes even unfitting (refer to the list of questionable scenes in the Story section).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\nThey were flat, inconsistent and their behaviour made no sense at all in certain situations. \\n\\n\r\nWe have the moe, shy protagonist, Mirai Kuriyama who has a blog and becomes omgbadass when challenged even though she has proven to be completely useless in previous stress situations. Yet Mirai's concept is overall interesting, as \"teh gurl wif sord frum blud\", but her personality could have been shaped better than that of a cute rodent with bipolar predator unexplained outbursts.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two perverts in this anime, BECAUSE ANIME. One of them, Akihito Kanbara, has an eyeglasses fetish and a mom who sends him hologram cards, changes the colours of her eyes with every skimpy outfit she wears without a reason, and has some sort of fulltime job as a furry prostitute. Besides that and their mother-son relationship where they chose to make even moments like him beating her and her yelling about abuse humorous, there is really nothing else to this character. Oh yes, and he is half-human half-shade BECAUSE ANIME.\\n\\n\r\nIf that guy was disturbing enough, the other pervert, Hiroomi Nase, gut-clenchingly, has a little sister fetish. And he also has a fetish for his little sister. Incest is so humorous! But as if that was not enough, he must be part of this family of cool cats, where his older sister, Izumi, is overpowered for no reason -pretty much like Mikasa from Snk-, and his little sister, Mitsuki, is stereo-typically a tsundere for her older perverted brother. Yet, they all act superior, their arrogance being directly proportional with their age.\\n\\n\r\nThen there are filler characters, like the cat-girl and the traditionally-dressed lady who both had shapeshifting abilities BECAUSE ANIME, the creepy guy who just appears and is creepy (and sometimes explains things without a reason to no audience whatsoever), the teacher who likes to drink and has relationship problems, and Sakura. The traditionally-dressed lady also had some vast knowledge of what was going on and could turn into the mammal version of a nine-tailed leupluredon, again, because you know why.\\n\\n\r\nSakura was probably the most annoying character in this anime. She was playing the role of the mandatory quiet character who never has emotions, except she also spontaneously tackles people feet-first like a fucking retard. She had about three moments in the anime where she acted kind, warm and friendly and none of them were explained so I am only guessing she is supposed to have some unexplained mental illness. Justifiable by the fact that all the people she cares about being either taken away from her or dying while everyone else disregards her almost completely.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nMostly frustration. I tried to make it seem interesting since it is so short, but I could not.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nThis anime is a couple of shards of good ideas in a container of 12 episodes that is then stuffed with cotton filling just for it to be there. Essentially, this anime remained in the concept stage and published that way, without any work put into developing the story or the characters whatsoever. It tries to be a dozen different genres at the same time, while virtually doing nothing useful with the amount of time it has. \\n\r\nThe frustration factor is the high potential this series has despite minor unoriginal aspects, and how much half-assery got mixed in to create something superficially aesthetic but of no substance.",

            "content": "So here is my first anime review, I hope you like it!\r\nKuokai no Kanata or Beyond the Boundary, is a fairly good fantasy based anime. I would recommend this to viewers that enjoy shows that involve enjoyable main characters with supernatural powers fighting demons or monsters. While based on its light novel counterpart, Beyond the Boundary does a decent job of explaining the world to viewers but still ends up leaving loose ends. \r\nStory:\r\nThe main story of BoB is very good, being adapted from a light novel, it offers a typical journey of hero is introduced, hero fights demons, hero is in peril, and herois saved. The story in my opinion is broken off into two parts, the first have of the 12 episodes is setting of the viewer of getting familiar with the characters. The latter half is all about the typical journey I previously mentioned. Even though the story may be similar to other fantasy themed anime this one is sprinkled with likable characters that gives the story some special flavor.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWhile this is my first review at most I can say is that the art is pretty good, the fighting scenes were fun to watch and the models of the characters were very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe funny thing about the anime is that the background music fit so perfectly with the tone of the story that I barley even noticed it. As Im writing this section of the review I have to think IF I heard any background music. So don't expect any music to blow you away in amazement. But I did end up becoming a fan of the ending song. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters of BoB are the strongest part of this anime, each character is equally amusing and interesting. My favorite characters were of course Akihito and Mirai. Akihito is a blond who has a fetish for girls wearing glasses, and Mirai is a girl who does happen to wear glasses. each of these characters complement each other and of course end up making this anime enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nIn all I would say that the enjoyment of the anime is really good, with its likable characters, I never failed to smile or laugh after hearing \"how unpleasant\". While nothing notable make me jump out of me seat in excitement, I still found this anime fun to watch and would recommend it to others",

            "content": "Brought together by ostensible circumstance, the lives of two high school students are intertwined when they learn that they have more in common than they have different. Both lead a lonely existence as a consequence of wielding inherent abilities that are considered taboo, even among a largely supernatural society, and are united by the pains of shared misfortune as if their meeting was fated to be. . . The premise of the plot was indeed promising; had it lived up to its full potential, Kyoukai no Kanata probably would have been generally well-received among the majority of audiences. It has a good start, but dasheshopes by forcing an ending that nobody was ready for. Fact of the matter is, as enjoyable as it was; it lacked the delivery necessary to truly enchant viewers the way it could have, and that perhaps is what\u2019s most disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nStarting things off on a high note, the first half of the show reels you in with attractive character design and visual aesthetics. The temperament of the characters was such that each of them possessed their own idiosyncratic quirk and those eccentricities\u2019 worked together to make for humorously entertaining character interaction. Their light-hearted fun gives off an amusing, almost relaxing ambience that\u2019s generally desirable in the slice of life genre. The picturesque visual graphics don\u2019t hurt either, especially when it comes to the strikingly eye-catching action scenes. The fact that unique character design was prominent and neglected the use of avant-garde hairstyles was my guilty pleasure. I was also keen on the repeating color motif, which changed in each episode and the soundtrack was in good taste too; I was particularly fond of the performance of \u201cYakusoku no Kizuna\u201d in episode six and the ending theme \u201cDaisy,\u201d but I digress. \\n\\n\r\nThe area where this anime falls short \u2013 its Achilles\u2019 heel \u2013 is undoubtedly the execution of the plot. The idea behind the plot itself is nothing short of profound; however it lacks the proper execution necessary for viewers to fully enjoy the anime for all it had to offer. As the finale draws near, the progression of events is fickle and almost uncomfortably rushed, which I found was largely in part due to the restraint on episodes. It felt as if better development of the story would have meant poorer character development and vice versa, greater character development would hamper the progression of the story. Perhaps if there were twice as many episodes, the plot and characters could have been developed in a more ideal fashion. Regardless, the transition towards the end feels forced, spurring inconsistencies that one generally wouldn't expect when first starting to watch. Events become unnecessarily confounding, making it undesirably harder to grasp the scenario and empathize with characters\u2019 emotions, as dramatic as the ending is supposed to be. The anime wasn't bad, it just wasn't very well executed, and that in turn is likely to muddle viewer reception. It was a good ride but it could have easily been a lot better, so while Kyoukai no Kanata is still an anime worth watching, viewers may be disappointed in its inability to live up to its own potential.",

            "content": "KNK is a beautiful story about a (wouldn\u2019t you believe it) High School boy named Akihito Kanbara with a glasses fetish, and his underclassman, Mirai Kuriyama, a \u201cbespectacled beauty\u201d, according to Akihito. We soon learn that Akihito is half youmu, a species of demon that most of our main cast hunts. Because of his half-youmu nature, he is an immortal (or, very near immortal) meaning that he can suffer virtually any physical wound. Mirai is a Spirit World Warrior who has recently come to the human world to hunt youmu. She comes from a \u201ccursed\u201d clan of Spirt World Warriors, known for having the abilityto control their acidic blood at will, Deadman Wonderland style.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the major cast is just as lovable as well. Hiroomi Nase is a siscon Spirit World Warrior with the power of barriers, from the elite Nase family, a major player in the Spirit World Society. Mitsuki Nase is the younger sister of Hiroomi, as the siscon makes very clear. While Mitsuki also has the power of Barriers, like her brother, she mainly relies on her pet youmu, Yakiimo to do her fighting for her. \\n\\n\r\nWhile this anime starts off as an action and comedy oriented show, it slowly evolves into story about protecting what you hold dear, and deciding what can and cannot be sacrificed. KNK also becomes a love story between Mirai and Akihito.\\n\\n\r\nWhile avoiding spoilers, all I can say about the latter half of this series, is \u201cwow.\u201d KNK had a fast, yet relatively uninteresting startup, but come episode 5 or so, it really started heating up and left me on the edge of my seat every week. The final few episodes were their own form of awesome. The relationship of sarcastic distaste between Mirai and Akihito was so well built up that I ended up truly feeling for them in the final episodes, just praying for a happy ending. Speaking of the end, it was honestly one of the most well done endings I\u2019ve ever seen, leaving just enough cliffhangers for a S2, while wrapping everything that you really care about all at the same time; and I gotta say, it is the second anime to ever make me cry at the end, the first being Sakurasou no Pet Kanojo.\\n\\n\r\nAs for music, I don\u2019t really pay attention to it as well as I should, I wasn\u2019t even planning on starting this blog until today! However, the Opening (Kyoukai no Kanata) and Closing (Daisy) themes are both incredible, and I have them both on my iPod, and listen to them on a daily basis.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve never been great at giving things numbered scores, but I guess I\u2019ll have to try to do this one justice, eh? I think that I\u2019ll settle for an 8.5/10 because I\u2019m not sure how bias I am. The first few episodes almost lost me, but the ending (what I remember most) was one of the best ones I\u2019ve watched.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed this review, please check out my anime review blog at trips-anime-review.tumblr.com/",

            "content": "Beyond the Boundary was Kyoto Animation's offering for the fall/winter anime season. As expected by their reputation, they created a show with absolutely gorgeous animation. The use of colors and clear, vibrant visuals are a feast for the eyes. Sadly, I believe this is the only aspect of this show that deserves applause.\r\nThe story follows Mirai Kuriyama and Akihito Kanbara. Mirai is a spirit world warrior, the only one left of her cursed clan. Spirit world warriors earn a living by hunting youmu, which are other worldly beings (like demons) that are born of negative human emotions. Akihito is a half human, half youmu. Thepremise is far from original to those familiar with anime. Sadly, the plot going forward becomes more and more confusing, and by the very end of the series I did not understand the motivation of both the villain and Mirai. I was left questioning \"Why the heck would this character do this?\" I felt that the plot was poorly explained, and I truly didn't understand what the cast of characters were working towards for the second half of the series. I even attempted to look up an entire plot summary on Wikipedia to better understand the story, but to no avail. I feel as if there are plot holes left very exposed, on top of the story already presenting as generic. Now, I don't mind a generic story if it is grouped with other good elements, because I believe cliches are cliche for a reason- that those messages or concepts resonate with or interest people for whatever reason. However, I found the characters to all be very flat. The only exception I think is our two main leads... I felt for them in the bond and similarities they shared with one another. Aside from that though there really wasn't much to their characters either, and a character should not be defined by one single aspect. So in conclusion, none of the characters are three-dimensional whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, I found the humor in the show very off-putting; the vast majority of the humor was very awkwardly, sexually based (characters referring to themselves as hentai, or \"perverts\", very very random displays of cosplay that did not fit into the story whatsoever, etc.). Yes, a lot of times anime has this type of humor and I have grown accustomed to it for the most part. However, in this series it felt like it was forced to fit into the show, as if it was desperately trying to get noticed *ahem fanservice*. I know Kyoto Animation does have a reputation for creating moe characters, but really these elements felt so unnatural and awkward in the show.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all these criticisms I still found the show entertaining enough to complete the series. Why is this?? I think it's simply because I enjoyed the visuals and action scenes (which were nicely choreographed). The opening and ending credits were especially beautiful, and paired with some nice music tracks. In fact, my favorite part of the show may just be the opening and ending!! I think that's telling in itself.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a short (12 episode) series with action, beautiful animation, and moe/cute characters, check this out. If you're expecting more than that from this show be prepared to be disappointed.",

            "content": "When two people are brought together by the hatred received from others, are they cursed or somehow blessed?\nFrom the very beginning, I knew that I would enjoy this series. The story seemed interesting enough and the art looked amazing. But in the end, that's not why I ended up loving it so much...I fell in love with it because of the characters and their interactions with one another. \nStory: 8\nOne day, the main character Akihito comes upon a girl standing on the edge of a building rooftop. Determined to save her life, he rushes to the roof and loudly declares: \"A girl who looks asgood in glasses as you...simply should not die!\" \\n\\n\nFrom the start, these two were already unknowingly connected, with the half human-half youmu Akihito and Mirai, having been born into a cursed bloodline, both being shunned by everyone around them. Through this mutual empathy, a friendship is born.\\n\\n\nIn my opinion, the story isn't \"clich\u00e9\" or a \"train wreck\" at all. Yes, there could have been a little less filler and a little more story, but I believe that this amount of filler was necessary to establish the relationships between the characters as well as to help us get to know them a bit better. I personally feel this story is unique enough, especially considering the thousands of other anime series out there for which I couldn't quite say the same...\\n\\n\\n\nArt: 9\\n\\n\nThe art was one of the best aspects of the series. I was extremely impressed with Kyoto Animation's high animation quality. Moreover, the art style is great! It's bright, it's colorful, and there's plenty of attention to detail, making the action scenes flow quite nicely. Each scene looked absolutely amazing...I couldn't get enough of them! I especially liked the characters' eyes: they were so colorful and detailed and pretty and...\\n\\n\n...Ahem, were was I again? Oh yeah, the art style is great!\\n\\n\\n\nSound: 8\\n\\n\nI really liked the opening theme song (Kyoukai no Kanata by Minori Chihara). I think it matches the anime's mood and the characters' situation. Not to mention it was kinda catchy. The ending (Daisy by Stereo Dive Foundation) was a bit more upbeat and still pretty good, though I still preferred the opening.\\n\\n\\n\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\nI love the characters. They were all so diverse, making their interactions with one another quite unpredictable. It was refreshing to have some personalities that were a little less \"typical\". As someone who has seen a reasonably large amount of anime, it's very difficult to find something different, especially character wise. Though what I really liked was how no matter how dark the show got, the humor shown when the characters interacted always kept me laughing my ass off.\\n\\n\nHowever, I do think certain characters (Mitsuki, for example) could have gotten a little more development. I mean, I know this is a short series, but some things could easily have been replaced with back stories or something with little to no substance lost.\\n\\n\\n\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\nI loved this anime series from beginning to end and just couldn't stop watching it. It's funny, has romance, action, and magic, and it's fantasy. What more could I ask for?",

            "content": "Kyoukai no Kanata, an interesting anime to review. Kyoto Animation has created another beautiful spectacle to watch, with stunning fight scenes, and great visuals all round. Sadly, the sound and art was the only outstanding thing about it. Although it seemed promising, and the story of Kyoukai no Kanata attracted me, I didn't really like it at the conclusion of the series. There was no real depth to most of the characters, and the story was quite bland at the beginning, but towards the end, I started to grow to like it. However, I didn't quite like the ending, as it was confusing.\r\nBefore I startedwatching Kyoukai no Kanata, I read up about the synopsis of the series, and the concept of a dark fantasy anime seemed quite promising. However, as time went by, it didn't feel like a slice of life dark fantasy anime, more like a comedy, especially at the beginning. Classic Senpai moments occurred between Akihito and Mirai, and although I found it humorous, it seemed that the director was trying too hard to make it funny, and not focusing on the more important part of the anime, like developing the story line. It seemed quite generic, in the sense that all they did was crack some jokes, fought some monsters every episode. Nothing interesting really happened until about midway through the series, when it seemed something more sinister was at work. \\n\\n\r\nI almost felt like dropping the anime around the third episode, because the plot didn't feel like it was going anywhere. Thankfully I watched on, hoping that something more serious and interesting would develop, and it did. If you are starting to watch this anime, and you're getting bored by the first few episodes, I encourage you to watch it, and see how it goes. The comedy aspect started to slow down towards the middle of the series, reaching its pinnacle at the 6th episode, and the story started to become more interesting and serious after that, with the director focusing on the dark fantasy and drama aspect of the anime. There was still a good amount of humour throughout the series, and I had a few laughs with the interactions between characters. However, there wasn't enough time or things done to fully develop the characters, especially the supporting cast. Not much is known about them, or the enemy in the series. The enemy's motives aren't really talked about or explained in the series, which was what I found disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation has produced another stunning anime for the eyes. I found the action scenes to be especially beautiful, but overall, the art was quite nice to look at, one of the best I've seen. The vibrant colours used throughout the whole series were what I enjoyed, and it brought the standard of the anime up. This was one of the things that kept me from leaving the anime at the beginning. Especially towards the end of the anime, the scenes were amazing, as there was more action to look at. It was definitely better than most animes that I have watched. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is quite good, and my personal favourite was the ED, Daisy, by Stereo Dive Foundation, followed by the song in episode 6, Future Star. The dance was quite good and I enjoyed it, and it was followed by some good humour. Daisy was used very well in the anime, and I felt that in most of the episodes, the ending was a nice transition from where the series left off, and I felt that it was a great ending song for the anime, and it was placed well to leave the viewer in a state of anticipation for the next episode. Personally, as the episodes got more interesting, I grew more attached to the anime, and was waiting for next week's episode. \\n\\n\r\nI quite enjoyed Kyoukai no Kanata in the end, although like I mentioned before, I was quite confused at the end(people who have watched this might agree with me). The art and soundtrack was quite good, and the story was decent. I found the humour funny at some times, and the second half was definitely better and more enjoyable than the first. The beginning starts of a bit shaky, but I assure you, stick in there, and you will enjoy it. I feel that maybe Kyoukai no Kanata could have been extended to 24 episodes instead of 12, so that the characters could be more developed, and we could have more of an attachment to them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think that Kyoukai no Kanata is a good anime to pass the time with. But, if you are looking for an anime with in depth characters and a deep plot line, this isn't the anime for you. Rather, it is just a short and sweet anime, with some humour inserted inside for laughs, captivating main characters who have questionable interests, and classic senpai moments. I found it to be a decent anime, and not 'unpleasant' to watch.\\n",

            "content": "Kyoukai no Kanata (Beyond the Boundary) is an adaptation of the novel of the same name. Having never read the novel, I will not make any comparisons, and will review this based on its own merits.\r\nAfter watching the first episode of this series, I was hyped. The art, wordplay, cute main female and funny main male characters.. I thought I was in for a real treat. Well, that initial sweetness soon started to taste oddly sour. Which is a real shame. Let me elaborate.\r\nKyoto Animation provides us with stunning visuals in this series. I loved how the atmosphere is often dark and dreary, yet witha faint touch of light here and there, that glimmer seemingly attached to our heroine, \u2018Miss Clumsy\u2019 herself, Mirai Kuriyama (more on her later). The animation for battle scenes are spectacular, and had me rewinding many a time to relive a moment that just blew me away. The fluidity of bodies during action scenes is just so well done as well, with Kuriyama and the various youma being especially well animated. This atmosphere is torn up and thrown out the back window all too soon with ridiculous outfits (let's just say there is a maid outfit with bunny ears involved at one stage), situations and even entire episodes revolving around comedy and fan-service. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of breaking up the darker sides to the story, it only made me lose any interest I originally had. Many shows keep a dark side all the way through and those who don't give in to fan-service are those that in my humble opinion, deserve the higher ratings. If a story on it's own can't stand up without the constant crutch of cute girls and innuendo's, then sorry to say but your story is terrible. And this show's story is, well, yeah it's not good.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, I found the OP to be mediocre, but as the show progressed, so did my taste for the woman\u2019s voice in the opening song. I ended up watching it every episode, and not skipping it like I do with many other anime. But I will say, it certainly doesn\u2019t fit the shows feel quite right. \\n\r\nThe ED is just wonderful. \\n\r\nThe music that plays throughout the show is something that really stood out for me. Instead of being there, the tracks used set the mood for scenes near-on perfectly. Action scenes really *feel* like good old down-to-earth ACTION scenes, and coupled with the animation, I couldn\u2019t help but be completely immersed in them. In the calmer parts of the show, the music is less influential, but certainly fits just right. When the story was lacking (and it did at times), the sound was there as a crutch to put a bit of feeling into a scene, and this is evident throughout the entirety of the show. The music is very well done.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in KnK are very 2-dimensional, in that any development is only either very minor, episodic or forced. Kuriyama's character is honestly frustrating to watch, because, I adore her character design. The hair colour and shape, red glasses and just being generally kawaii (ha), but from episode 1 to episode 12, she doesn't change hardly at all. Yes she cries a lot, shouldn't that give her instant development-points? Not at all. The reasons behind the emotion in this show are honestly nothing for the viewer to care for - only making those that cry seem weak and annoying and those that get angry seem hotheaded and unintelligent. \\n\\n\r\nSide characters are plenty, and most serve a similar function of being plot devices, which is fine, but repeated all too often and only makes the storytelling evidently weak here; having to rely on temporary characters with convenient back-stories. \\n\\n\r\nThis show had good promise in the first episode, but quickly tripped over it's own laces, with 11 episodes of rolling further and further downhill. \\n\\n\r\nBut it wasn't all bad; it made me giggle and laugh out loud, \u201cawww\u201d at Kuriyama\u2019s clumsiness and gasp at the action scenes. But the sad emotional scenes KnK force-feeds the viewer really put me off. I feel like this show tried to be too many things in too short of a time-frame. This show would have greatly benefited from having a 24-episode running, so plot and character development could have been drawn out well enough for me to actually care what was happening. \\n\\n\r\nIndividual ratings are as follows: Story - 5; Art - 8; Sound - 8; Character - 3, Enjoyment - 5; Mean total - 5.8 (rounded to 6))\\n",

            "content": "All right this will be the first review I have ever written so please be lenient with me. Anyways here goes. \nAfter being asked by a good friend of mine to \"check out this new Kyoto-Ani anime\" and \"whether it's good or not\" I came to the conclusion that I had to watch this show and oh surprisingly it ended rather recently too so I quickly went on the case and started watching this show from episode 1 to 12 and let me tell you that it was one of the worst decisions of my life. (This is my opinion - no offense.) \nSo firstof all, let me tell you my story: I've been a great fan of Kyoto Animation after watching a few of its most well-known shows such as K-ON, Haruhi Suzumiya, Clannad, etc and they all left me good memories. They all had decent soundtracks, CGs, character designs and art and the comedy factor always kicked in at right moments. What about Kanata? NOPE. This show started with a very confusing episode where you just start off with a supposedly \"ordinary human being\" in a supposedly ordinary world where our protagonist gets stabbed in the heart by a \"cute little girl in glasses\". Okay, that's fine I've seen that many times before... Getting stabbed in a fantasy world is something ordinary - nothing new here. But then, we return to his ordinary life as if nothing ever happened without an ounce of an explanation so far. \\n\\n\nThe first episode is basically nothing but a small introduction of a few characters without any depth. They introduced many terms but didn't bother explaining them anyhow, so you're like \"Okay, they might explain it later but wait, what's with this \"youmu\" thing, what IS a \"Youmu\"? Oh, so they're supposedly \"monsters\" that take various shapes depending on human emotions... All right that's fine, but wait why do you act as if there's nothing wrong with living with supernatural creatures that attack human beings from time to time I mean why are you standing around as if there's nothing dangerous about them? If there're zombies roaming around in town, shouldn't people be worried? Aren't you an ordinary human being? Ooh so later on, we discover that he's half youmu... 'Kay. And wait a second, where do they come from? WHY ARE THEY HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE? Answer? \"...\" \\n\\n\nNEXT - a new term gets introduced: \"spirit world warriors\", wtf are those? We didn't get any proper explanation in the whole show (from the beginning to the end) but we can deduce that they're human beings with some kind of spiritual energy that fights youmus for the sake of making a living with it or simply to protect people from getting harmed and that their \"spiritual energy\" allows them to see youmus with the naked eye - wait isn't this a complete rip-off of Bleach?! \\n\\n\nNext we have our characters: \\n\nKabara Akihito - A half-youmu  half-human protagonist that is immortal and has a pretty hardcore fetish for bespectacled females that wouldn't mind spending a few hours talking about nothing but glasses... \\n\nKurimaya Mirai - A cute little glasses-wearing klutz that has the ability to bend her own blood to her will.\\n\nNase Mitsuki - The club leader, a spirit warrior from a rich and well-known family that has an odd-behavior of teasing people in strange manners yet doesn't really do much in the whole show while still having a LOT of screen time and,\\n\nNase Hiromi - Her brother, also a spirit warrior that also has a strange fetish, namely a little sister complex (he's also some kind of weirdo like our protagonist that could fantasize about his little sister eternally). \\n\\n\nThis makes up our main characters. The side characters aren't even worth mentioning, because both main and side characters have near-zero development and depth that spent EPISODES chatting about meaningless things with random things showing up here and there and forced comedy everywhere. \\n\\n\nThis show consists of 12 episodes of \"I have no idea what the hell is going on\". No character has a clear background, nothing is really explained - we know nearly nothing about any of the characters - their conversations are meaningless (99% of the time) - we have no idea what's the story about (the show wasn't meant to be some kind of slice of life but IT IS- it's supposed to be SERIOUS but it's NOT [a huge mess overall]) - random things pop up here and there without any logical explanation like how our protagonist randomly teleports to Mirai at some point (our little bespectacled cute girl)... Oh there's more to the randomness factor, from all the shows I've seen, people with some kind of super power or weapon tend to have RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR ACTS, our supposedly \"last of her kind\" girl at the beginning doesn't even have the resolve to kill a \"ghost\" haunting her apartment (nor does she have the courage to face it) yet she had the resolve to kill a human being in her past and stab a random guy?  \\n\\n\nThe show even tried adding the romance factor in it but it had no depth whatsoever so you're just standing there and be like \"wut\". Other than the horribly confusing story and wood-carved characters their art and sound were rather enjoyable - I expected nothing less from Kyoto-Ani. I gave it 3 for the story, 3 for the characters, 8 for the art and 8 for the sound. I didn't really enjoy the show because of how BAD this show is. It's a 5 overall (it's as lenient as I can get). \\n\\n\nIn conclusion, this show had a lot of potential - supernatural shows tend to be really \"special\" in their own ways but this show is just a rip-off of many things without any proper \"uniqueness\" that isolates it from its counterparts. The lack of depth, the useless conversations, the lack of explanations, the lack of THOUGHTS (basically everything happened because it happened) had left me a really bitter aftertaste - I really hope Kyoto-Ani was on crack during the whole creation process because this was a total waste of effort, a COMPLETE HUMILIATION - it's a shame really. I would never recommend this show to anyone - it may of had a lot of beautiful CGs, art and ending theme but I would honestly take a banana or potato over this show any day.",

            "content": "I remember seeing the trailer for Kyoukai no Kanata (Beyond the Boundary) back when it was first announced and thinking it looked like one of the best new anime series of the year. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations and actually turned out to be one of my least favorite shows I've ever watched. Without further introduction, I'll explain why.\r\n[Story: 1/10]\r\nThe plot is easily the most disappointing aspect of KnK. The biggest problem is simply the poor pacing and lack of direction. With only 12 episodes, a series doesn't have time for filler episodes and multiple story arcs; it needs to pick adirection and go. KnK struggled with finding this direction. The first few episodes seem to be a supernatural comedy about the male protagonist Akihito helping the female protagonist Mirai become a successful Spirit World Warrior. Then it turns to the approach of the Hollow Shadow, a powerful youmu considered almost impossible to defeat, we learn some disturbing facts about Mirai's past, and the show takes on a deeper, more psychological tone. The sixth episode is filler with absolutely no connection to the rest of the series, the seventh is dedicated exclusively to the reconciliation of Mirai and a side character, and after that the series tries to be a paranormal romantic drama revolving around Akihito's half-youmu status and some sort of half-baked plot involving the Society of Spirit World Warriors, the Nase family, and a youmu called Beyond the Boundary.\\n\\n\r\nThe show could have taken any of these directions and been highly successful. A romantic comedy about a half-youmu teaching a supernatural warrior how to defeat youmu? I'd watch that. A psychological drama about a girl from a cursed clan trying to become a powerful warrior? Hell yes. Instead, though, KnK switched between these different themes constantly and ultimately failed to establish any meaningful story whatsoever. One minute we're getting funny, casual, low-stakes situations -- like Mirai needing to defeat a youmu in order to make rent for the month -- and the next, the Hollow Shadow is approaching and it's endangering the entire city, oh my god, this is serious business everybody! And then before we know it the Hollow Shadow is out of the way and we're back to watching Akihito and Hiromi monologue about their bizarre fetishes. It's the eighth episode before we hear a single word about the namesake of the entire series, and even then we don't get much information about it -- or about the rest of the world, for that matter; the mechanics of the KnK universe are never really established or explained, and new information is simply shoehorned in when the plot requires it. Even in the final episodes, when the fate of Earth itself supposedly hangs in the balance, the story lacks tension or suspense. The countless fight scenes may have been beautifully animated, but I never felt like the characters were in any danger. Concepts and conflicts are never explained or even fully resolved; there is no logical transition from one plot point to the next. Things just pop up to cause drama for the characters, who inevitably are able to solve even the most overwhelming problems for no apparent reason, and the show stumbles along to the next meaningless scene. If it sounds like I'm ranting, it's only because I'm frustrated -- I truly think this show had a fantastic premise and enormous potential, but it didn't capitalize on it at all.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 10/10]\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, the art is really the only redeeming quality of this show. Not only is the animation clear and fluid 100% of the time, the color and composition are gorgeous. Even if the fight scenes were pretty much meaningless, they're still total eye candy. In particular the animation of the supernatural powers that Mirai, Mitsuki, Hiromi, Izumi, and others use to fight youmu was a pleasure to watch. There's so much color and vibrance that it's easy to imagine the Spirit World Warriors' powers being real.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs were also very well done; some series are full of sameface moeblobs, and while KnK certainly has its moeblobs (Ai, I'm looking at you), they are easily distinguishable from one another. Not as distinct as the character designs of, say, Cowboy Bebop, but still better than plenty of shows out there.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 7/10]\\n\\n\r\nKnK's music isn't particularly outstanding, but still good. There were two tracks that would always catch my attention; the rest were pretty generic, not bad, but not really worth mentioning either. The voice acting was mostly really good. I personally got a bit tired of Mirai's high-pitched whispery \"senpai?!\"-ing, but that fit her. Every character had a distinct and recognizable voice, and the seiyuus' delivery of lines always matched the mood of the scene very well.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't particularly like the OP or ED, but I didn't hate them either. The OP ended up growing on me, while the ED never really took. I think they fit my expectation of the series better than they fit the actual series; they both have a lot of energy that KnK never really achieves.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Character: 2/10]\\n\\n\r\nAfter plot and worldbuilding, character development is this show's greatest failing. Initially all of the characters seem distinct and interesting rather than typical anime archetypes. Akihito isn't just an average easygoing high school boy; he's an immortal half-youmu. Mirai isn't just a warrior with a dark past; she's a socially awkward klutz with a thing for growing bonsai. Every character KnK presents is completely unique. Logically, they should have a lot of room to develop even further and conflict with one another in interesting ways.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this never happens. The characters never truly develop beyond these first impressions. Sometimes we get new information about characters' pasts and secrets, but this doesn't make them change as people; it just means that viewers learn something contradictory to what they thought they knew all along. Furthermore, pretty much everything about the characters is told through dialogue rather than shown through their actions, which only serve to push the plot along in a certain direction rather than demonstrating a character's unique personalities or beliefs. The relationships between characters are even worse; they seem extremely forced and illogical. Most of them only exist to support certain plot points, but even this construction falls apart because the plot points are equally weak and contrived. The motivations behind many characters' actions are extremely unclear, and I found myself wondering frequently why certain characters existed at all. Some of them still manage to be likeable, but like most aspects of the show, they are never allowed to reach their potential.\\n\\n\r\nFor a specific example, take the protagonist Mirai. Supposedly she is the last remaining member of a cursed clan of warriors and has a dark past that causes her to distance herself from others. This is a good foundation for a character. But why is her clan cursed/why were they all murdered? Not a word about this for the entirety of the series. Why doesn't this influence her own feelings about her powers? If she's supposed to be so distanced from everyone, why does she just suddenly give in and start hanging out with the other characters like it's no big deal? (For that matter, if it's so important that she stays distant from them, as we learn towards the end, why in the world did she give in so that she could read gardening books? This is an example of how the comedic and serious elements of the story are completely at odds with each other, rather than uplifting one another.) Why doesn't she display any emotional damage from the disturbing past that we learn about? Why is she able to repair a horribly broken relationship, one that has been haunting her for years, in the span of literally five minutes, just by saying a few really clich\u00e9 lines to the other character? These questions are never answered or even legitimately considered, leaving Mirai to be a two-dimensional ditz whose only two lines are \"S-Senpai!\" and \"Fuyukai desu!'\" Other characters get similar (lack of) treatment: where's the complexity Akihito feels about being half-youmu, an extremely rare creature? Why don't we get to see any of that until he alludes to it in the series finale? I will reiterate that every character, like the entire show, had vast potential -- but then were reduced to catchphrases and bad jokes, and pushed around like pawns to accomplish illogical plot points.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 3/10]\\n\\n\r\nThere were times during KnK that I laughed, but most of the jokes and catchphrases were overused (and weren't that funny to begin with). There were times that I cared about the characters and wondered what they would do next, but most of the time I was too confused by their motivations (or lack thereof) and illogical behavior to feel very invested in their fates. There were times that I thought the show would end up redeeming itself and I'd love it after all, but that never really happened. And with every episode that failed to live up to my originally high expectations, I was reminded of those expectations and how good the show could have been. I spent a lot of time thinking \"If only x had been done differently, this part would have been so interesting!\" and not very much time thinking that the actual show in front of me was very interesting. So while I enjoyed certain aspects of KnK, those aspects were completely overwhelmed by the ones that made me roll my eyes in disgust again and again. I have nothing against cute slice-of-life comedy or over-the-top action, but KnK constantly vacillated between these two things with no rhyme or reason, and it was impossible to enjoy because the story and characters weren't making any sense.  I have a policy of finishing every anime I start, but this one was hard to stick with. I mostly kept watching for the animation; anytime the Spirit World Warriors used their supernatural powers was a visual treat.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Overall: 5/10]\\n\\n\r\nI hate to write off KnK as a bad anime. I really wanted to like it; it started out with a lot of potential. Unfortunately, it just didn't deliver, and I have to be honest. The animation and music were the only completely positive elements of the entire series; everything else was an absolute mess. Characters and story were all over the place, never deciding which direction to take, and most of the concepts and plot points were merely thrown in to stir up mediocre melodrama. I'm sure literally every other critical reviewer of Kyoukai no Kanata has already used this phrase, but as Mirai Kuriyama said approximately five million times: \"How unpleasant.\"",

I definitely had a fun time watching this anime and it was different to what I actually expected. At times throughout this anime, I felt very lost and didn't quite understand what was going on... not sure if it was on purpose... but by the end of the anime, I managed to connect everything together... annnnnnnd...... it still didn't make sense... THE POWER OF GOOGLE~ But I really liked it all the same, because it wasn't your everyday high school story with supernatural power characters. The characters were hilarious! I have neverseen an anime where ANY CHARACTER would admit s/he is a hentai and still be hilarious... *looks around...* IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS!!!! I found it very cute and it definitely shows, it takes a long time to understand someone, and even people who may seem happy-go-lucky have a terrible past. Interesting anime, recommend anyone who hasn't watched this to watch it!",

The story was pretty much of a fantasy, half harem and comedy in my point of view since there is this one episode which doesn't even relate to the real story.\r\nThe art of the anime in the combat scenesare pretty good where Mirai's blood gets drawn out and how the weapons move like especially Izumi and Hiroomi, their barriers was pretty amazing like how long did it take them to draw something like that, it has those rather complex barriers with squares everywhere.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development was pretty well developed for MIrai and Akihito where the other two main characters are a bit left out. I just know the two boys are pretty much hentai in their minds but are protective and perverted to the ones close to them.

            "content": "I still remember that Idol dance scene that the main characters did and it won't burn off my retina. That's the whole reason how I found this anime in the first place. It just popped up on my Recommendations and I decided to watch it. The scene was weird and funny at the same time and then I decided to watch the whole show. \r\n[Story]: (6/10)\r\nThe dark fantasy follows a high school sophomore named Akihito Kanbara. Although the boy appears human, he is a half youmu and invulnerable to wounds because he can heal quickly. One day, Akihito meets freshman Mirai Kuriyama when it seemsshe is about to jump from the school rooftop. Mirai is isolated because of her ability to manipulate blood, which is unique even among the members of the spirit world. Disturbing events begin to unfold after Akihito saves Mirai. \\n\\n\r\nOk...so KyotoAnimation created this anime. Seriously, why couldn't they just made this into a slice of life anime? Or something similar to the fillers like Episode 6 because it seems to me that that's what they do best. When it comes to dark story, it just comes off as laughably stupid. The first arc is pretty much an introduction to the word that they're in, the characters, the exterminators, the youmus and all that crap you need to know. Then there's the second arc which is the most stupidest and the most inconclusive arc I have ever seen. They tried to explain all this crap about who Beyond the Boundary is and why he's so dangerous than the last youmu who is the second strongest..Honestly, I don't even care anymore. Why is it inconclusive? Watch the last 2 episodes then you'll find out. There are a lot of unanswered questions in the show, especially the ending. The ending also felt rushed. Since this is a spoiler-free review, I won't mention the plot holes that the show left open. \\n\r\nThe battle with the main antagonist also didn't last that long. How long is it? It only lasted for about 90 seconds. All they did is stamp in the OP song and make the fighting scene fit that OP theme song. How anti-climactic..\\n\\n\r\nThe story turned out to be a piece of dog sh*t but the filler and slice of life moments turned out to be one of the best parts of the show. You have the characters fooling around, the perverted little sister moments, the glasses moments, the club activities and of course, Episode 6. Where they did an Idol dance to defeat an eye monster. Honestly, Ep. 6 is the funniest episode in Kara no Kyokai. Because of the funny moments that I mentioned in this little paragraph, KyoAni should really stick to creating Slice-of-Life moments because that's where they do best. On the other hand, if they take out the fillers and actually develop the plot then we could have gotten ourselves a show with a great story. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nThis anime is, like I said, created by KyotoAnimation and if you know the company then you should know that their animation is one of the best in the anime industry. The animation looks great, the environment looks great and the character design also looks great. Especially Mirai. The actions scenes are, surprisingly, smooth. This is the first time I've seen a KyoAni anime with an action scene so it did surprise me. The Idol Dance scene also looks great. Their dances are smooth and it didn't really felt too choppy. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (10/10)\\n\r\nMost of my soundtrack rating comes from the OP and ED theme song. It's very rare this days to see an anime with both OP and ED theme song that are great. Welp, KnK has it. An OP theme song that has made it into my Favorites list and an ED theme song that has also made it into my Favorites list. \\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"Beyond the Boundary\" by Minori Chihara and \"Daisy\" by STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION. All I can say about the OP theme song is..It's f*cking awesome! I just love the singer's voice and song's buildup. I also love the ED theme song. Now, that's what I call an Ending Song. The male singer has a soothing voice and the song is so...calm.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has an excellent Voice Actors. I can't explain why they're excellent because we all have our own interpretations of \"excellent\" but you have to watch the show by yourself. The VA that I love the most is Mirai's voice. She sounds so innocent and cute and her catchphrase is awesome.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Characters]: (8/10)\\n\r\nI want to introduce the characters first before giving my own opinions about them. Akihito Kanbara is the main protagonist of the show. He is a second-year high school student. He is half human and half youmu and he has a fetish for girls with glasses. Mirai Kuriyama is a first-year high school student and she is an Exterminator. She has the ability to manipulate blood and can also create a sword using her own blood. Hiroome Nase is a third-year high school student. He is the eldest son of the Nase family and Mitsuki's older brother. He has a huge sister complex. Mitsuki Nase is a second-year high school student and she's the president of the Literary club. \\n\\n\r\nWhat do I think about the characters? I love them. Akihito and Mirai's paring is great and makes the show funnier. I also love Mirai's catchphrase. \"Fuyokai des\" or \"How unpleasant\" in English. Whenever Akihito and Nase is paired, it also makes the show even funnier because of their perverted instincts. Mitsuki's personality seems like she is a person who doesn't really care about anyone and it also adds to the comedy of the shows. Comedy aside, you can see the relationship develop for both Akihito and Mirai and you can actually see Mitsuki care for someone. You can also see the characters working together when it's needed. \\n\\n\r\nThe side/supporting characters do have some major issues. They get introduced at one point to the show and then you don't get to see them again. Some make an appearance for an episode, disappear, and later appear again at the 2nd last episode or the last episode. Some of them are not in-depth and some of them are just downright useless. For example, Sakura got some focus on the earlier episodes but was later thrown aside when her conflict was solved. Her conflict was also solved way too fast. I guess, that's understandable considering that this is a 13 episode series. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (8/10)\\n\r\nThe story may suck ass but that doesn't mean I enjoyed the show. In fact, I did enjoy the show because of its Slice-of-Life approach and the fillers. Pretty weird that I enjoyed the fillers a lot more than the actual plot itself. It should be the opposite. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (8.2/10)\\n\r\nJust like Mirai said. \"How unpleasant\". How unpleasant, indeed. How unpleasant the f*cking story is. However, if you can look past the crappy story then you might enjoy this show because of the Slice-of-life moments and the filler moments are great and hilarious to watch. Especially the Idol Dance Episode. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Great Animation\\n\r\n+Outstanding OP and ED theme songs\\n\r\n+Outstanding Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Great Main Characters\\n\r\n+Slice of Life and Filler moments\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Mediocre story\\n\r\n-Useless side characters\\n\r\n-A lot of plot holes\\n\r\n-Filler are a lot better than the actual plot. It should be the opposite\\n\r\n-Mediocre and Unexplained Ending",

The sceneries in the anime are truly breathtaking. \r\nOne of the reasons as to why i truly enjoy this anime so much is probably due to the characters. The characters are all beautifully made, with backstories for most of the characters. Akihito is truly a boyfriend/ husband material, with him being so caring and sweet and everything that a girl would want in a guy. Not to mention, hegot a sense of humor. With a clumsy girl, sweet guy, a sis-con brother and a sarcastic sister, this anime is truly packed with many comedic moments. I truly enjoy the time when they teased each other. \\n\r\nhowever, the bad points of this anime is probably not going in depth with the characters. it was probably because this anime was too short, with only 12 episodes and 1 recap movie and one continuous movie ( which focus mainly on akihito saving mirai ). As for the other characters, they were never truly explored. Like for example, Mitsuki and Hiroomi Nase, where are their parents? why is their older sister the one taking care of everything? why did the older sister told Mitsuki that being alone is the best? \\n\r\nNot only that, they mentioned that Akihito is half-yomu in which they told us that the mum is the human while his dad is the demon. But hey, not a single detail about his dad was told in the anime nor in the movies. So, what actually happened to the dad and where is he now? & not to mention that akihito's mum is actually friends with Mirai's mother. How did it even happen? Did akihito and Mirai actually met before when they are young?\\n\r\nhonestly, this anime left me with more questions but yeah, it is an anime worth watching & i never regret watching it.",

            "content": "Ahh Kyoukai no Kanata,\r\nThis is the one show that I would use to define 'meh'. It wasnt bad by any means, but it wasn't good either. My main problem with the show was the lack of character; you can tell the amount of effort a studio has put in by the supporting characters. Kuriyama-san was an interesting character, definitively out of the norm but the supporting cast was boring and stereotypical. I felt the show trying desperately to make me care about events and characters, but I simply couldn't.\r\nI kept on feeling the show could get better, but it just fizzles out and loses intensity.However, I cannot fault the art, the show was beautiful. It could have possibly been one of my favorites art-wise. Nonetheless, In the anime world, art is important to make a great show, but it cant save a bad one.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my harsh words, Beyond the Boundary is definitely worth a watch on a rainy day. Just wouldn't push yourself to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\r\nPretty 'meh'\\n",

            "content": "Hey! Have you ever had that one anime that made you go all \"nyeeeeeeeeeeh!\" because of it's sudden ending? If yes, then this anime will be one of them. \r\nKyoukai no kanata (also known as \"Beyond the Boundary\" in English) is a anime which was created by KyotoAnimation (\"KyoAni\") and was something along the lines of Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! but way more complex and these fighting scenes that you have seen in Chuuni had meaning and mythology to them. Now, usually when I review an anime, I try to look at flaws etc. such as: Animation mistakes, sounds/music, character. character development, character interactionetc. and while watching Kyoukai I haven't found as much as I was afraid to find. Honestly I shouldn't be surprised as before I have watched KyoAni's works such as \"Hyouka\", \"Free!\" etc. and I know they create great, if not amazing, work and sometimes even beyond that (get the pun?). However, not all anime is perfect and this might be reason why I was pleasantly surprised. You should know the overall story line etc. if you watched the anime, if you don't I would highly recommend for you to watch it first before continuing. \\n\\n\r\nSo let's star with the basic; Story.\\n\r\nKyoukais story was something I have seen before but I haven't seen it handled well or at least not as well as Ao no Exorcist etc.\\n\r\nThe story is simple, young boy named Kanbara Akihto meats girl, Kuriyama Mirai who tries to kill him but he turns out to be immortal. The story is shown that both of our main characters are what we call \"monsters\", inhuman creatures that are trying to push through life after tragic accidents (explained later in story) with one handling it well and other being scared by it. The two of them compliment each other and try to help each other in their little adventure with help of two siblings; Nase Mistuki and Hiroomi. The story doesn't have simple point A to point B kind of thing and this is what I enjoy a lot in anime, especially when it's done well like in many animes you may see. If you want to find out more about story, watch the anime or read up on it.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals/Sound track:\\n\r\nAlthough not everyone will agree with me on this part, but KyouAni animation is great but it is not the most amazing thing I have ever seen. I have seen animations from movies like \"5 cm per second\" , \"garden of words\" and way more to know that they are the most beautiful movies I have ever seen and I know that comparing these movies to KyoAni's work is unfair. But I have to say this; The animation in Kyoukai is detailed. Not only based on explosions and huge monsters (also known as \"Yomu\") but also on facial animation and body moments, and it is very beautiful. Sadly, Kyoukai didn't hit my \"amazing\" rank when it comes to the animation because, despite the details, it still had some animation flaws that went into fore-mentioned explosions and huge monsters and special effects etc. The music on the other hand, the music was fantastic. It was gorgeous and I love every single soundtrack it had to offer. The opening and ending were composed by both amazing artists and it sure was great to listen to it especially on a boring day of school at break.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAlthough the characters were very simple and not that much creative (not in my opinion at least), the style of KyoAni's added a lot of cuteness to them and a bit of badass which made them even better. If you want to find out more about the characters then search up or watch the anime. Now, here's the most important key in the whole thing; character interaction. I am one of those people who simply doesn't care if the animation is the most beautiful things the world or your music is breath taking (I will still compliment them), if you have characters, good or bad, with wonky character interaction I will be forced to point it out. Thankfully, this is the part where I don't have to do so. Kyoukai has great character interaction, especially with our main; Kuriyama and Mitsuki, who get along in one episode created just for that. The character development is also good, but I think it could've been done with more details.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\r\nFor me, Kyoukai no kanata was a great anime where almost nothing was standing still and nothing was out of focus (and if there was, it wasn't that noticeable), like for example the magic behind the stone checking (or whatever it's called in English) or something along these lines. The story it self was good and it was just like the opening; it gave you an amazing ride with beautiful views for your eyes every time you were bored. \\n\r\nSo in general, I would recommend this anime the most if you don't mind the huge amounts of blood and massive amounts of \"moe\"/adorable factors.\\n\\n\r\nthis is IKira-n\\n\r\nSigning out.",

However, there were some plotholes left behind which made me a little confused, some of these were explained with the movie so overall I found it really enjoyable.\r\nArt and Sound- 10\r\nHere wego, this was the main reason I became interested in this anime. This anime delivered breathtaking sceneries mixed together with a beautiful soundtrack to create a work of art. Furthermore, this anime delivered me one of my favorite openings AND endings of all time, these went along perfectly with the show's aesthetic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 8\\n\r\nI was really satisfied with this show because it gave me a good romance story mixed with a bit of comedy and a few plot twists and at the end of every episode I was always amazed by some of the things that had happened.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 8\\n\r\nThis show has its upsides and its downsides, very good upsides by giving us stunning art, sound and character development, as well as some bad downsides (which you'll see by watching the show) but not as bad so that they're unwatchable.\\n\r\nI definitely recommend you checking this out and watching the 2nd movie for a more satisfactory ending.",

            "content": "Beyond the Boundary is a one of a kind show and can best be described as \"an all around solid anime\", exceeding in almost every genre it dabbles its hands into, there are really no weak points in this show of which I can remember. The story revolves around two high school students, one being a half youmo (immortal human/monster) and a spirit warrior descended from a cursed bloodline. Both with their own horrific pasts, they begin to find solitude in one another as they grow closer together, fight evil side by side and discover that they share much of the same pain.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nThe storyconsists of one main premise which focuses on the two main characters' relationship with one another along with their connection with 'Beyond the Boundary', a materialized apparition made of all the hate and evil in peoples' hearts. \\n\r\nImagine if all of the evil in the world took material form and became grotesque monstrous breasts. You would then be living in this world. \\n\r\nAlong with a few side stories with different characters and two spirit warrior clans working towards their own goals, you have a group of several different stories all coming together to compliment one another and bring their own contribution to the characters, story and show as a whole. Though there are a few points in the show where you may become lost in the confusing subplots and different spirit warrior clans, it quickly explains itself and gets right back on track.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are something to be commended for. Each one very defined and well developed with their own sense of individuality. Each brings a sense of purpose and meaning behind their actions, which become very important when tough decisions must be made by each. The audience is given understanding of each character and what truly drives them as a person.\\n\r\nAlso, the comedy is definitely worth bringing up. All of it very quick and witty, making me laugh out loud many times throughout the show.\\n\r\nThough there are deeper and stronger characters I can think of from other anime, you need to take into account that this show is only 12 episodes long. That is what I believe is this show's greatest feat. To put so much characterization and story into such a short time without feeling rushed is an achievement in itself.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation 10/10\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say here. The animation and art for this show is superb. I would give it an 11 out of 10 if I could! Colors are deep and strong, eccentric detail is seen everywhere and the character models always look amazing. The smoothness and beauty of the animation makes the action sequences of this show even that much more enjoyable to watch. I found myself re-watching entire episodes just to see the fight scenes again and marvel at them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nIn the end this show isn't one to miss, with strengths in every area and something for everyone to enjoy, \"Beyond the Boundary\" is a short yet masterful piece of Anime.",

            "content": "WARNING! THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS (WITHOUT CONTEXT)! PROCEED WITH CAUTION!\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nThe first time I saw the poster for this anime, I instantly wanted to watch it. The warm colors, the usual Kyoto animation style and the general direction they took looked really nice. And the show keeps the same quality. The warm colors aren't kept as much as I would have liked, but it still looked amazing. That was mainly why I wanted to watch the show, and you should too. \r\nThe animation is the only thing I found to be special. The music was pretty good and was definitely my second favorite part, butsome of the songs were pretty forgettable. the characters were also pretty good, but still the usual anime cast. With the pervert, the cute one, the serious one, and the main character. But I liked these character more than I do for similar characters, cause they weren't very one-sided which made them more realistic. the story was definitely my least favorite part, not that it was bad, but pretty mediocre nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nThe world was the thing I noticed at first. The story is about a world where there are invisible demons that can interact with the human world, and where certain people are born with powers that make them stronger and make them see the demons most people wouldn't see. Now aside from that, the world just like any other SoL anime, which doesn't really make any sense. Cause in my mind, society would change a lot from what it is now if demons could interact with us. You could think of so many interesting changes, but there really is none. That was something that bugged me for a while.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing that bugged me was the first third of the show. The drama aspects were really boring and bland, and the episodes as a whole were confusing. A majority of the drama episodes are in the beginning, but we don't know enough about the characters that would make the episodes interesting. \\n\\n\r\nThe last third of the show was definitely my favorite part, cause they give characters more motivation, especially Mirai. The scene where they show us that her original task was to kill the beyond the boundary and why she rejects Akihito so much at the start, was really interesting but didn't feel forced in. And they explain it really well by showing the timeline. but sometimes the show tries to explain a little too much. things that could be explained with visuals. \\n\\n\r\nThat's something the show has a few problems with, the show doesn't tell formula. That's something that the antagonist has a lot of problems with. He explains his motivation when he could show it. That character is also the one that is the most boring in the show, cause he feels very unrealistic. He doesn't change over time, he doesn't have any good character traits and is just really boring overall. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo overall I would call this a beautiful show that has a lot of problems with story and characters\\n\r\n7/10 from me",

There are some parts that seemed like filler and didn't contribute a lot; however, there are tiny details that make a difference.\r\nThe art is very appealing to look at. The animation is smooth and there's no unnecessary movements. Each movement is significant from character movement to environment movement.\r\nMusic and SFX are appropriatefor each scene, but the voice acting is phenomenal especially for Akihito. Emotion flowed out of that character.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of character, development of them is piece by piece, but the difference seems so minimal that it's almost nothing.\\n\\n\r\nI can see how this wouldn't be for everyone, but there's no reason to NOT give it a try.

Big glasses, fluffy pink hair, oversized grandma sweater\u2014how could I resist?\r\nThe other characters were likeable, too. They had enough chemistry to keep the show amusing and from becoming a chore. The animation quality is fantastic. Every episode is just great to look at. The action scenes are dynamic and surprisingly well done. The soundtrack is memorable, especially the opening and endingthemes. So far it sounds like Beyond the Boundary should be 7 or 8 or 9, right? But this show proves that even all those great qualities can be suffocated by shit plotting and story.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the story\u2014as in there is none. There was something that resembling one. Something about stopping the demons. Whatever story it had was lost in the bad plotting. Every episode felt disconnected from the bigger picture. They were still enjoyable, though, because of the sheer charm of the characters and animation quality. There was always questions raised but never answered.\\n\\n\r\nSomebody is going to say (and they always do), \u201cYou didn\u2019t pay attention.\u201d As if that\u2019s a good defense. As if people watch something and deliberately not pay attention. No one is asking to be spoon-fed a story. That\u2019s boring. But you know what else is boring? Watching an overly-complicated, confusing story, too. It\u2019s your skill as a writer to balance between those two extremes.

I would\u2019ve given it a 7 on it\u2019s animation quality and characters alone.\\n\\n\r\nI would still recommend it just for the excellent animation and decent characters but only if you can tolerate the incoherent story.",

            "content": "Kyoukai No Kanata is by no means a bad anime, it was plenty enjoyable,  just don't go into this series expecting anything groundbreaking. The overall plot of the series is solid, if a bit standard. My one complaint is that the ending of the series wasn't satisfying because there were several questions left unanswered which really should of been. There was also one final twist that you could see coming from a mile away but still kind of felt like a cop out. The characters overall were likable, most of them got fleshed out backstories, and even though I kind of disliked Kuriyama atfirst because she seemed kind of flat, by the end of the series I grew to like her and I think how the series portrays the bond between Kuriyama and Akihito is one of it's strong points.  The art style of the series is gorgeous, of course. The fight scenes were well done and the overall animation was really pretty, which is what you would expect from Kyoto Animation. In my opinion, Kyoukai No Kanata gets a score of 7/10 and I will recommend that you watch it. It was a perfectly enjoyable anime, and if you go into it expecting a light series with action and a few more serious moments, you not be disappointed. Just don't expect anything too dark or groundbreaking. If you liked Kyoukai No Kanata, I would recommend watching Noragami, which has a similar plot involving main characters in high school and fighting spirits, but has a more comedic focus and in my opinion, more original and fleshed out characters, and adds the twist of gods being real and I would also recommend the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, which is also by Kyoto Animation and also blends lighter more comedic slice of life elements with more serious supernatural ones, but has a much more original plot ( which I will not spoil here). \\n",

            "content": "\"So what if people hate me!? Everyone loves flaming me on blogs and Twitter!\" - Kuriyama Mirai\r\nBefore I even get started, I need to get three things out of the way: I'm a sucker for \"bespectacled beauties\", this review is based solely on the anime and will not reference to the LN at all, and this is not an in-depth analysis featuring a full thesis on why I rated it this way. This is me simply giving my opinion.\r\nThe only thing I can compare watching this to is eating at a buffet. You stand at the front doors, really hungry and excited. As you getyour first plate of food, an overwhelming amount of feelings rush you head-on; Satisfaction, anticipation, happiness. However, as you get up for seconds, thirds, fourths, and then dessert, the guilt sets in and you just feel terrible. \"Why did I eat this much? I never should have came. I can't even finish this little square cake and some ice cream... It was a mistake to come here. I've had my fill. I thought it was a good idea to come here, but now I just feel like dying.\"\\n\\n\r\nThen you leave the buffet, and in 4 hours you wish you enjoyed it more instead of regretting going there in the first place because it wasn't as bad as you thought.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, anyway, all jokes aside, let's get down into the breakdown of this show.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10 (Fair)\\n\r\nIt was a great concept. In fact, it was amazing, but poor delivery and plot development issues stopped it from growing into something great. Creatures called Youmu roam the Earth and the Spirit World Warriors defeat them. Then boy who happened to be part-Youmu meets girl who happened to be a Spirit World Warrior, and hilarity ensues.\\n\r\nFor the first few episodes, I was genuinely confused on what was happening. Although the main concepts (boy and girl, basic setting) were very easy to understand, I didn't know what Spirit World Warriors were, and any time something of the sort was mentioned, I didn't feel any immediate danger even though there clearly was, because the concept was not fully explained to me. I'm not sure if it was just my own stupidity or not, but after a while I caught on.\\n\r\nUm, I can't tell what this show was trying to be. The Slice of Life aspect of the show was great! The comedy was great- I loved every scene of it. Then, after everyone had a nice laugh, they would switch gears and become really serious. Some shows can do that really well. This is not one of them. Because of this, I failed to feel any emotions towards the characters because of the conflicting genres. If they executed it better, I would have felt sadness, or extreme happiness. Don't get me wrong- I'm a softie. I've cried at shows that weren't even supposed to be that sad (-cough- K-On!! -cough-). However, they were basically forcing sadness on me, and I was hurting on the inside because I really wanted to be on my knees bawling, but I couldn't be brought to do that. This thought will be continued during the Character sequence.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 (Great)\\n\r\nAs expected of KyoAni, the art in this show is beautiful. Honestly, there's nothing to be said. The idle shots are masterfully crafted, the fight scenes are on point, fluid, and crisp, and any shadows, ambient light, etc. are drawn pretty well. Of course it's not completely perfect as everything has it's flaws, but it's very deserving of it's 9 rating. They continually have their quality consistent throughout all their shows, and it's brilliant. Well done, KyoAni!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 (Very Good)\\n\r\nTsuruoka Yota, thank you. Thank you for being the bass player for the band that is Anime. People don't seem to realize that sound plays a big part in shows, and with Kyoukai no Kanata, there is no exception. Although I don't agree with some of his choices, overall the sound is great and probably 90% of the sound in the show was placed for the optimal experience. It was one of the things I enjoyed- I love sound more than anything in the world, and I'm glad that I was not disappointed. Every bang, crash, boom, BGM, and ambient noise was placed pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10 (Fair)\\n\r\nWow, for once, the main character was not a complete copy/paste of a protagonist. Akihito has his own personality and it suits him very well, along with his character design. Kuriyama Mirai, as another main character, was also very pleasant. All the \"slice of life\" moments of the show really bring out what each character's quirks are. The \"siscon\" brother, the sister of the aforementioned, the eccentric and somewhat crazy mother, the conflicting rival, etc. However, that is where it stops. During serious scenes, there was, again, no feeling of immediate danger. I am someone who gets attatched to characters very easily. Naturally I was attatched to Kuriyama, but for some reason, when something important happened, or something sad happened, or whenever she made a decision, I didn't feel anything. I really beat myself up inside for not feeling anything, but it was something I could not put into words. It directly ties into the plot, because it just does not give the characters justice. If this adds anything, I was attatched to Kuriyama Mirai a lot more than any other character I've been attatched to, so something went wrong somewhere in the middle.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10 (Good)\\n\r\nI enjoyed the show. I really loved the laid-back scenes, where the characters poke fun at each other for their fetishes and quirks. The fight scenes were very fun to watch and it gave off this \"Ooh, did you see that sword hit? That was brutal.\" kind of vibe. However, what threw me off were the blatant plot holes and the unexplainable feats of anime. They also say that an ending can make or break an anime; Unfortunately, the ending breaks the anime. It completely nullifies the reason you watched the show in the first place, and leaves you going \"What? Did that actually just happen?\"\\n\r\nDespite that, I did enjoy all the moe moments and it made it worth the watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 (Good)\\n\r\nWhat can I say that already hasn't been said? It was a show with a boatload of potential that was clearly wasted with poor choices across the board. The characters are something to love, but any character would look bad if it was handed a poor retelling of a very well-written story.\\n\r\nIt was really pleasing to watch, and it didn't feel like a task. I wish from the bottom of my heart that I could have gave this show a higher rating, but as I got deeper and deeper into the anime, I just couldn't give it the rating I was hoping I could give it. It was a truly disappointing experience for me, but that's not to say that you shouldn't watch it. Maybe I missed something! Maybe I'm just biased. Maybe I don't know how to properly analyze anime and I'm completely wrong. Whatever your logic may be, I would still recommend this anime to someone who's looking for a mix of cute girls, action, comedy and drama coupled with beautiful art and superb sound. I still wish that this was just a Slice of Life show. I would love it so much- they did such an amazing job during those types of scenes. You could even say that those scenes were... \"Beyond the Boundary\" of good.",

Me on the other hand, wasn't disappointed with this anime, or rather I didn't really had any expectations at all except for the great animation. I included a breakdown to explain my scores:\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nI find the plot interesting in the average scale. Maybe because I'm new to supernatural genre that I suck it up. But I liked how the story did run out in the episodes. The story may seem confusing at times, and I had to like get back to some scenes and absorb it all, but Iliked how it turns out for everybody. Each episode didn't fail to make me want some more. The story does not only revolve on the events itself but there are times that character background stories were imminent. I also liked the relationship of the characters. Altho the story was slow paced, I enjoyed it. \\n\r\nAnd oh, don't forget the filler episode, which was hilarious in 100 different ways.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound - 9.5/10\\n\r\nNo doubt, I liked the artwork. It was amazing and very detailed that I was inspired to watch it in HD. And that ED, I had the song syndrome for a very long time. Altho the OP didn't really stand out as much as the ED. Best lantern festival and fireworks scene from kyoani. I also love it when the intro for ED will start playing as a background song moments before the episode ends. That's cooooool.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7/10\\n\r\nI liked the characters and their relationships, but I think the characters could be really improved. Like how they met or even some backstory for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\r\nLike I said, I find it slow paced at first, and the plot (from ep 1-4) were far from the real story plot, I find this anime really adorable, especially the hilarious bespectacled beauty scenes. :D \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\r\nThe reason why I really watch anime was when I enjoyed watching it, and when the anime ended, I bring with me parts of that anime. I'm grading this a 9 because I enjoyed watching it, I was touched by the relationships evolving around the story. This may be flawed, But for me this is worth my time. \\n",

            "content": "Kyokai no Kanata is an interesting anime, it is very different from the standard model of shows for Kyoto Animation to doo, an action and dark fantasy story, I was very interested in the project when I first saw the teaser and decided to give it a watch.\r\nThe anime is\u2026good, despite what the promotional material and the opinion of people who obviously haven\u2019t seen the show will tell you, it balances the humor and the drama really well, when it\u2019s time for moe and goofiness, it does it like the way only Kyoto Animation can, but when it\u2019s time to get serious and fight foryour life, the show focuses only on that and nothing more, I like shows that can do that.\\n\\n\r\nIt has great characters, you will get to feel and like them all, they have interesting personalities not based on the typical archetypes found in animes and a great supporting cast that makes you love them.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is where the anime\u2019s problem lies, it isn\u2019t a very original story, it is your typical good people with power versus monsters and an hybrid plot, although the characters bring a very needed variety to the story which helps separate it from the rest, however at the end of the day, it is a story you\u2019ve probably seen before and done better. However this doesn\u2019t mean the show is not enjoyable to watch, the characters as stated before and the setting while not very original, it draws attention from the viewers so it is a story you\u2019ll probably guess a few plot points here and there, but it is one story you will enjoy, but not one you\u2019ll probably rewatch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime is good, not the worst product Kyoto Animation has put in there, but not the best one either, I\u2019d say watch it if you like these \u201cmonster hunting\u201d stories, you\u2019ll have a fun time, just don\u2019t expect an epic masterpiece here.\\n\\n\r\nIf Kyoto Animation keeps this and releases more variable animes, I can say they will break the stigma they have of \u201cThe Moe Studio\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7/10\\n\r\nRecommended? : Only if you like monster hunting and hybrids stories.\\n",

            "content": "For me, Kyoukai no Kanaka was a really fun show to watch. Now, I understand that not many people enjoyed the show as much as I did, but, to me, it was entertaining and very well paced. Also, unlike many of the 12 episode anime that I've seen, the ending was satisfying and didn't leave me wondering what the heck I just watched. The show follows Mirai Kuriyama, a young high school girl who is a Spirit World Warrior (someone who hunts and kills youmos - which are beings similar to Norigami's phantoms). The male lead is named Akihito. I've heard many complaints that Akihito'scharacter is unrealistically kind. However, if you get far enough into the show, his personality makes perfect sense because he is just treating others the same way he would want to be treated. Watching the show, I get the feeling that his kind personality is somehow his way of trying to atone for who he is and what he's done. \\n\r\nNow, I understand that this show wasn't the most original thing I've ever seen, at least in the first few episodes. But, as KnK progresses, I think it makes up for that by the pacing and planning in the story. It starts out very simple and starts to add on, kind of like building blocks. Many people stop watching by episode 3 for the \"lack of originality,\" but I think the show really shone out in the last few episodes, making up for the weak beginning. Kyoukai no Kanata was also told in a way that made you feel like it was a lot more than 12 short episodes. Once it got down to business it was really good. However, some of the episodes (particularly episode 6) that really had no plot to the story and were completely irrelevant. Being the person I am, my favorite thing in the world is strong and well-paced character development, and I think these episodes should have been used for that. \\n\r\nOne of the main complaints I have for this show is how all of the substantial male characters seem to have some sort of weird obsession. Akihito is obsessed with glasses. As someone who wears glasses, [at first] I was very happy that the show was bringing so much attention to that. But, as the show went on, Akihito's obsession beginnings to border creepy. Same goes for Nase Hiroomi, who is almost (if not) the same age as Akihito, and has a little sister complex. At first I thought it was fun to watch, but, again, as the show went on, it got pretty weird pretty fast. It kind of makes me sad, because Hiroomi had a lot of potential in his character. I feel as if his personality would have been way more intriguing if he wasn't constantly exclaiming how much he loved his little sister. On another note, one of the characters (a man named Fujima Miroku) was introduced as an interesting character. It got me believing that he was a bad guy, and though it was said that he was, everytime he came on screen, he was just a pain in the rear end. \\n\r\nMy last point I am going to make is that the animation was just simply beautiful. It really helped the story move along graceful and the characters' movements always looked so natural and fluid. The fight scenes were really entertaining to watch, from Mirai conjuring her blood sword to Naze Izumi twirling around her staff-like weapon. The shots were great and very unique in portraying the characters as the story progressed.",

Yes. But KnK does have some major flaws. For me, it was possible to overlook them, but for others, it might not be.\r\nStory: 7\r\nKnK's story isn't earth-shattering, nor is it extremely original. But it isn't completely cliche and the characters keep it fresh. I wish I could give the story a 9, but the ending of this show is stopping me from doing that. The final episode was sloppy and confusing. The reason for thisis that the anime is based on an on-going light novel series. So after the anime caught up to the novels, they ran out of storyline. For some reason, it was already decided that KnK would not have a second season, so they had to come up with an ending on their own. \\n\r\nBad. \\n\r\nI don't want to say anything spoiler-y... but this ending was EXTREMELY disappointing. They could've done so much more with this anime... I thought it was relatively popular, so I'm not sure why they wrapped it up so quickly. \\n\r\nSo I just like to pretend that the last episode doesn't exist. You can probably come up with a better ending on your own.\\n\r\nHowever, the ending is not a reflection of the overall storyline. The ideas taken from the light novels were very interesting and involved lots of character development. So I don't think that the ending makes this series unwatchable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nI. love. this. art. It's pretty much what made me want to start watching in the first place! All of the characters are very cute and I like the art style. The action sequences are also amazingly done, and I thoroughly enjoyed them. Watching all of the spirit world warrior's talents in action was very cool. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI really liked the KnK opening and ending songs. The more you listen to them, the catchier they get. And the singer for the opening really is amazing. The soundtrack was very nice and matched the mood of the anime well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nOne of the best parts of this anime is its characters. There's not that many of them, but that just gives more depth to the 10 characters they have. \\n\r\nMirai, the main character, is, well, adorable. And it's not in a creepy or moe way. I loved her catchphrase of \"fuyukai!\" and the way she dealt with things. Mirai is a good person who's had lots of unlucky shit happen to her, but she finds a way to go on, and is also one of the strongest characters in the show. \\n\r\nAkihito, her love interest and another main character, is also pretty likable. His obsession with glasses is kind of weird at first, but you get used to it after a while. He's a caring and persevering guy, and he truly loves Mirai, no matter how many times she tries to kill him (bahaha)\\n\r\nI liked Mitsuki and Hiroumi too, but their relationship was a bit strange. Is it supposed to be slightly incestual? Is it comic relief? Is it serious? I'm not sure. Let's hope it's comic relief.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI'm extremely picky with my anime. I'll start five different series, and then end up sticking with one and tossing the others aside. So when I can focus on one anime, it deserves a special place in my heart. I finished KnK in about a week, so it automatically gets at least an eight. And the characters, art style, and music were also very good. So yes, the enjoyment factor of this anime is one of its biggest selling points.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nKyoukai no Kanata made me laugh, smile, and (almost) cry. Its ending was shitty, but I'm willing to overlook it because everything else was so good. I'm very disappointed that it won't be getting a second season, to say the least.",

            "content": "Kyoukai no Kanata was a spectacular anime. It's an anime that I chose at random, not really expecting to love as much as I did. This is my first review ever and the reason I'm doing it at all is because I feel like I need to express how amazing this anime was. There were some flaws, but there are flaws in every anime. Overall, it kept my attention throughout the entire anime. I started it this morning and I finished it just a minute ago. \r\nStory: 8\r\nAs far as the story goes, it is absolutely perfect until near the end where it gets abit confusing. (Spoiler alert) They don't really explain fully what the puppet Akihira is until later, they don't really explain all that well about how she defeated the beyond the boundary and how it got back inside him, and lastly, they don't explain at all how she is even alive at the end or how the ring just dissolved into thin air when he was holding. Those are minor things, though, when you think about it. How certain things happen isn't important because all the audience should really care about is the happy ending. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is fantastic and I noticed a lot of good things about the art while I was watching. One thing in particular that I noticed (not sure if this counts as art, but whatever) is that when Sakura is sort of leaning over, her bell necklace is stuck in between her chest and her sweater. And then it falls out and idk, just the movement and the way that action was displayed was perfect. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nI don't have much to say about the sound exactly, because it's not something I really pay close attention to. The voice actors for Mirai and Akihira are perfect, though, I can say that much. His voice when he's yelling has the perfect undertone, and her voice when she's crying sounds so real and heartbreaking that you can't help but tearing up. The sound effects were great, too. When Mirai used her blood to unlock Akihira's door, the sound of the blood going in and hardening and turning the lock was just right.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThe characters were developed really well, however, I didn't like the whole 'that's unpleasant' thing. I mean, catch phrases are great when you use them sparingly but when you use them literally all the time it seems so on-purpose that I can't help but cringe every time. But I love how the romance developed throughout the story and the characters' understanding of one another is really great. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime and I honestly wish it were longer. I usually skip the parts where people who aren't the main characters aren't involved, but I didn't skip anything for this anime. I watched the whole thing from the edge of my seat and I cried and I laughed and I had a great time watching it. I can only hope to find an anime as enjoyable as this one again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was a hit, at least in my opinion. I loved it. There were some mistakes and some places where things could've been better, but overall this anime was everything an anime should be.",

            "content": "Yeah, I'm writing my first review on a three-year-old anime that I've only seen four episodes of. Got a problem with that? Don't care.\r\nStory - 1\r\nI realize that I don't have all the pieces to this puzzle, but when each piece is the size of my thumb in length and width and there're only six of them, I don't really need them all to get the picture. It's very cliche, and I swear to god I wrote the same freaking story in fifth grade. This is by far the worst element of the show, and I say that with confidence even having not finished theshow.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, exposition. Every of the exposition. Like, there's one part in the first episode where they show that regular people cannot see these monsters by having one such beast run past a couple of girls who don't even look up from their conversation, however when it comes to anything important, like the story, everything is explained via talking head scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, plot holes if you think about any event for more than three seconds.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\\n\r\nThe show looks great. The animation is fantastic, for the most part, sometimes it just feel like they're faking it, but they're faking it well, so it's okay. The character designs, while a bit on the average side and a bit forgettable, were nice while I watched it.\\n\\n\r\nMirai was the most unique looking out of every character who had more than one scene up to episode 4, and all she is is pink with glasses. I mean, she's absolutely adorable, and that seems to be her only function, but I don't even know where to look when I look at her. All I see is a pink fluff ball.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 5\\n\\n\r\nThe music during the lighthearted scenes just sounded so bubbly that anytime the show started to get serious, it just looked like it was trying to be as edgy as possible. As for the dramatic music, I cannot remember what it sounds like off the top of my head, but I would assume it's orchestral and dramatic n' shit. I never found myself disliking anything I heard, it just didn't seem like all of the music fit exactly right.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3\\n\\n\r\nWater dose?\\n\\n\r\nReally, though, after the second episode, every conflict with Mirai and main character guy, whose name I forget because I couldn't care less about this non-character, had my rolling my eyes. Then, everything any character does ever has literally no purpose.\\n\\n\r\nLike, \"Ima fight the big bad boss monster!\" Why? \"because I killed my friend because boss monster possessed her!\" Yeah, okay, but why are you attacking it now? \"... See answer B?\"\\n\\n\r\nThen, and this probably should have been said in the story section, they don't even go over how they got into such a situation as to allow the friend girl to be possessed by the boss monster. Like, everyone in this city has fair warning, so how was the other place any different?\\n\\n\r\nYou know what? I'm going back and dropping story by a point.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3\\n\\n\r\nEh. Didn't make me feel, and it never really got intense. It's just basic enough so as to not completely bore me, but there's not much worth coming back to.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5\\n\\n\r\nThere's a cute pink fluff ball of a girl, and that is the most this show will give you. Otherwise, it's nothing. It's literally nothing. I'm not sure how else to describe it. It's just stimulation for the brain. Just something your eyes can see and your ears can hear.",

            "content": "Kyoukai no Kanata or \"Beyond the Boundary\" was a really good series. I enjoyed every episode in the series from start to finish. Here's my review of it.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story was unique, but it did remind me of Bleach and Yu Yu Hakusho. Every time I hear about Spirit Work Warriors, I think of Soul Reapers or Spirit Detectives. And the Youmu reminded me of Hollows in the Bleach series. It was packed with action and awesome looking fight scenes. There was also a feel good romance bit added in.\r\nArt: 8\r\nKyoto Animation has outdone themselves this time. They don't always do many action packed series,but this one has scenes that were very captivating to the eye. The characters were good looking. Mirai Kuriyama sure is a cutie. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 \\n\\n\r\nThe OST was quite well done, but that wasn't what I enjoyed the most. I loved the opening an ending. They are both very catchy and I caught myself singing the songs constantly as I do my daily routine. There are also good voice actors in the series. KENN, who voiced Chase Suno and Judai Yuuki, did a good job voicing Akihito Kanbara.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nMany of the characters are lovable and enjoyable. Mirai's ditzy, but heroic personality made her an interesting and well done heroine. Akihito's glasses fetish and Hiromi's sister complex added to the comedy of the series. Their constant jokes about little sisters and girls with glasses always made for a good laugh. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI probably said it already earlier in this review, but I loved this series. It had beautiful backgrounds, interesting characters, and a plot that kept me on the edge of my seat. I'd love to see an OVA, movie, or even a second season of this if possible. It left me wanting so much more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the series was amazing. For a KyoAni series, this is my second favorite. Chuunibyou being my first, though. I recommend to give this series a try. If you like action, comedy, supernatural, and romance, this series is for you. I'm sure you'll love it just as much as I did. I'd even give this series a rewatch. Kyoukai no Kanata is great. End of story. xD",

            "content": "Kyoukai no Kanata (or Beyond the Boundary as I'm going to refer to it for the rest of this review) is a fairly cliche anime that got everything right. It should also be noted that this series will be getting a new season so this review might not be accurate upon that release.\r\nStory:\r\nBeyond the Boundary uses plenty of Red Herrings and \"this is how it is, because it is\" explanations to propel the plot forward. It keeps you on an IV drip of information that is just enough to grasp what is about to happen. I never feel like I knew what is going tohappen next. The universe of Beyond the Boundary has a lot of depth to it and learning more about it keeps the viewer motivated to continue watching.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNicely drawn and animated; another series with the now standard super-detailed-almost-creepy-but-cute-at-the-same-time eyes on the female characters. The fight scenes have so much stuff going on in them and it looks fantastic. Environments were detailed and looked lived-in, it was interesting to look at the backgrounds and pick out minute details.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nLoved the music in Beyond the Boundary, especially the outro song. The FX used in the fights were also top notch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAside from the two main protagonists, Mirai and Akihito, none of the characters really stood out. The side characters do develop - but the issue is their personalities weren't very interesting to begin with, so I never found myself caring overmuch about them unless it related to Mirai and Akihito. Beyond the Boundary has one of the most genuine relationships between two characters that I've seen in recent memory and that relationship essentially carries the entire show from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAn acceptable story and a substantial budding romance allowed me to get fully invested into Beyond the Boundary's story, and I enjoyed it the whole way and I am very interested in the new season coming out eventually.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nA solid 8/10 anime that keeps you guessing with a intriguing plot; along with one of the most sincere love interests I've ever seen.",

            "content": "I've had my eyes on this series ever since I first heard about it. The art looked gorgeous, the story sounded intriguing and I was still riding the whole \"dark fantasy\" wave started by Madoka Magica. I was a little discouraged after reading numerous negative reviews, but since finals ended and I had nothing else to do, I decided to sit down and watch Kyoukai no Kanata in its entirety in one sitting.\r\nI think it's best to describe my reaction to this series in phases. Upon finishing the final episode I entered Phase 1, in which I was still feeling the adrenaline rush from theclimactic action scene and a mild sense of wonder from the ambiguous ending.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps 20 minutes later I entered Phase 2, in which I began questioning the quality of the anime I had just spent 4 hours watching. This is when I started recognizing loose ends and the almost non-existent character development.\\n\\n\r\nOne hour after finishing the last episode, I entered Phase 3, in which I realized that Kyoukai no Kanata is a mediocre series at best. It falls short because it tries to accomplish far too much within a mere 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIn the opening moments, we are thrown straight into the action. Anything that even remotely resembles an explanation of the series' events is nowhere to be found in the first episode or, for that matter, any episode. The series fails to lay down a foundation for the universe in which it exists, leaving the plot an incoherent mess of shallow characters and loose ends.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are as two-dimensional as they look. Little, if any, time is spent on developing the characters and instead each character is simply given a set of traits that they possess simply for the sake of possessing them; and honestly, the entire cast of characters doesn't fall very far from the tree of action anime tropes. Personally, I found Mirai to be incredibly annoying all-around and her apparent inner dichotomy between weak, clumsy, indecisive klutz and strong-willed, morally righteous warrior got on my nerves for the entire duration of the series. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the main cast, although they are reasonably likable, they have no depth and no motivation for their actions other than that they are the good guys who have to fight the bad guys. Sadly, the supporting characters seem to contribute little to nothing, including the pathetic attempt at a main antagonist, who appears to aim for nothing and accomplish nothing in his maybe 30 minutes of screen time.\\n\\n\r\nKyoukai no Kanata's only redeeming factor is its presentation. The art is gorgeous, which makes the action scenes a visual pleasure, if nothing else. The series is packed with eye candy that may or may not be able to make you momentarily forget its flaws in almost every other department.\\n\\n\r\nIt is with great regret that I acknowledge that I did, in fact, waste 4 hours of my life on this series. Kyoukai no Kanata's only high point is episode 6, which, ironically, is essentially the equivalent of a filler episode. If you are like me and are feeling discouraged from watching this anime because of all the negative reviews--\\n\\n\r\nGood. You should be.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I\u2019m just going to get this out of the way: this may well be the most disappointed I\u2019ve ever been in an anime. I suspect this will shift whenever I get around to watching Eureka Seven: AO, but Beyond The Boundary tops the list for now. This show actually managed to squeeze some real tears out of me, but everything surrounding this event is so flat and lifeless that it loses quite a bit of potency. Do note: I don\u2019t really think this show is worth the time investment, so this review CONTAINS SPOILERS.\r\nBeyond The Boundary is the story of Akihito Kanbara and Mirai Kuriyama,as well as a few others. In this show, there are youmu (spirits) and spirit world warriors. Basically, Akihito is a half-youmu (he was born to a youmu and a spirit world warrior). Kuriyama happens to be a spirit world warrior. The show opens up with her attempting to kill him. Multiple times. It's later revealed that in an injured state Akihito basically goes full youmu. That's a problem. Outside of that, the plot has little direction until the last four episodes, where it's revealed that there WAS a point and that this WAS worth the time investment. \\n\\n\r\nFrankly, the side characters are of little importance. I actually do like both of the main characters presented. Kuriyama\u2019s character design is actually what attracted me to the show the begin with, and I was quite satisfied with it from a visual standpoint. Actually, I take back what I said earlier to note one exception: if all you care about in a show is high animation quality and fairly good comedy, then stop reading this and go watch Beyond The Boundary. Animation is top-notch; it\u2019s actually some of the best of seen. Of course, that\u2019s not all that makes the show pretty to look it; the art and design are great too. Kuriyama\u2019s blood power is super cool and\u2026 oddly beautiful. I will say her power reminds me of Deadman Wonderland, but originality is tough these days. Additionally, I found her to be quite a compelling character. Her backstory is interesting, as well as somewhat tragic. As far as emotional impact goes in this show, she\u2019s at the heart of all of it. Akihito, while also a visually well designed character, falls flat comparatively. This isn\u2019t to say I don\u2019t like him, but I honestly just didn\u2019t find there was all much to him when digging into the meat of the show. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the same holds true for pretty much every other character, of which there are quite a few. I have difficulty remembering a lot of the names in the show just because there\u2019s so little to identify anyone by. I mean, I remember the Nase family, and their role in getting Kuriyama to try to kill Akihito, but other than that I\u2019m drawing a blank on anyone\u2019s name. Normally, I would go on the wiki and just get their names for the sake of this review, but I feel, in this case, the fact that I don\u2019t remember their names (and don\u2019t care enough to try) illustrates just how bland and lifeless this show is. \\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s the issues I have with the show just from a plot structure standpoint. The first few episodes were solid. They set up the world we\u2019re looking at, set up the youmu vs. spirit warrior stuff, and set up the main characters. I will say the ideas presented in the first half of the show are inconsistent with those presented later (money is illustrated as an idea in the first half in a way it just isn\u2019t later). Then there\u2019s this god awful filler episode (where they fucking dance as IDOLS for fucks sake). Then the show drops any pretense of really focusing on anyone other than our two mains and just barrels to the finish. That being said, I didn\u2019t really have a problem with this; I felt the show was finding it\u2019s footing and focusing on the truly interesting parts of the world it was focusing on, as well as the central character relationship. We find out that the youmu in Akihito is Beyond The Boundary, which is a dangerous youmu with no physical body. Kuriyama dies to destroy Beyond The Boundary without killing Akihito, and it was honestly pretty touching. Actually, had this show ended on around episode 10, where Akihito receives a text from the dead Kuriyama, I would have given this show a fairly high score. I mean, at least that would be tragic. At least it would mean something. It\u2019d be like a 5 Centimeters Per Second or Steins;Gate type ending; he found love and then lost it. Also, I think \u201cI don\u2019t feel unpleasant\u201d was a wonderfully touching last line for Kuriyama to have. It turns this phrase that she uses for comedy and general disdain and uses it to show she\u2019s finally happy. THIS part made me shed a tear or two. Unfortunately, the show doesn\u2019t end there, and has two and a half episodes left. After this, it just goes off the rails. Kuriyama is still alive on an alternate dimension that also happens to be in the sky and she is part of Beyond The Boundary and\u2026 wait, what? I watched the 11th episode twice because so much damn shit happens so fucking fast. Also, I was really trying to see if the main villain has any clear motive, but nah, he\u2019s pretty irrelevant. I questioned if he even need to be there (I\u2019m not really clear on his role in the show. I think he doesn\u2019t have one). Basically, what ends up happening is Akihito ends up reabsorbing Beyond The Boundary, and then because Kuriyama is part of Beyond The Boundary she dies. And yeah, that was sad. But I wouldn\u2019t say it was any sadder than when Akihito got that text from her (if anything it was less sad because it was somewhat more intimate). Then Akihito goes on the most fake-deep ending monologue I\u2019ve heard in a long time (it made me laugh, honestly), and then KURIYAMA IS FUCKING ALIVE. There is no explanation. Did they forget which character they made immortal? Because that was Akihito. I mean, what the fuck is this? That character died and came back to life twice in like three episodes. That\u2019s just poor writing. \\n\\n\r\nHere, I\u2019ll make a list of things that would have made this show good. \\n\\n\r\n-cut out the filler (episode 6)\\n\r\n-replace it with an episode or two fleshing out the supplementary characters \\n\r\n-cut off the last two episodes\\n\r\n-remove the spirit warrior villain; Beyond The Boundary is enough to have as a villain \\n\r\n-end the show when Akihito receives a text from Kuriyama\\n\\n\r\nThat would have been a great show. But that's not what we have here. This isn\u2019t the worst show I\u2019ve seen, but it sure did disappoint me. I give it a 4/10, maybe a 5 on a good day. I wouldn\u2019t really say it\u2019s worth your time.",

            "content": "Here we have another anime from Kyoto Animation, the company responsible for amazing works such as Chuunibyou, Clannad, Hyouka, and the Haruhi Suzumiya saga, but also created trainwrecks such as Tamako Market and K-On. When I first saw the trailer for Kyoukai no Kanata, I was really impressed by the change in genre that KyoAni was taking. Super natural was a theme lightly touched, the most being in Chuunibyou. After watching the series at first with excitement, I ended it with less satisfaction than before.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nKnK started off really strong, setting up the plot and the characters excellently. It hooked you in really well, butonce the plot got going, it slowed down... a lot. They had to put a filler episode in a 13-episode series for who knows why and the story line ended up becoming bumpy because of that and other factors. The climax in the last three episodes was very much rushed thanks to the poor pacing, making it extremely hard to follow and very confusing. Still, the plot was interesting and held out a lot of potential. It was just poorly executed and could have been loads better. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 \\n\r\nYou can never go wrong with the quality of Kyoto Animation art. KyoAni is best known for amazing art elements and fluid animation. Combine this factor with supernatural Spirit World Warrior powers, and you've got one hell of a treat for the eyes. The different character and youmu designs were colorful and no doubt was it stunning. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nKyoukai no Kanata's opening and ending sequences were rather average. They didn't exactly blow me away and I'd usually skip them. The background and original soundtrack music wasn't anything too amazing either. However, the voice acting was spot on. The characters were quite lively and no one seemed out of place with their voices. The too scores balance each other out, so KnK's sound was an above average 8. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nEach of the characters here were really interesting. The main cast, consisting of the high school gang, the Nase's and Aya and Ai, all had powers and secrets among them. Seeing them interact and revealing surprising background information kept me watching the series, but the development and relationships between them was lacking. The two that got the most growth was, of course, Akihito and Mirai. To really make the characters pop, more development should have been made. Otherwise, they were interesting, likable, and mostly well rounded. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nDespite the shoddy pacing, I still really enjoyed Kyoukai no Kanata. Now, I wouldn't say that it made me super happy and excited, but it was enough for me to like watching it. I'm glad I finished it all the way through because the climax was pretty hectic in an appealing way. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 \\n\r\nEvery anime that Kyoto Animation releases has a tendency to be remembered as either a masterpiece or a trainwreck. Kyoukai no Kanata was able to avoid both categories and to me, was an anime to watch but not one to be remembered. It very much could have been twice as good as it was, but that fault lies in the storyline. \\n",

            "content": "Labelled as a dark fantasy, Kyoukai no Kanata is an interesting show that has received quite a mixed reception, with some liking it and others criticising its strange mix of genres. In my opinion, the best way to describe what the show is like is that it is a supernatural anime with comedy and hints of slice of life.\r\nStory: 8\r\nProbably the weakest point of the series is the story. Kyoukai no Kanata is based in a fantasy world where Spirit World Warriors have to defeat youmu and the story follows the unique half youmu Akihito. Despite having a very interesting premise, I believe the executionwas done quite badly. The pacing of the show and action scenes were good, however, often I found that tense moments were ruined by the untimely comedy that they felt the need to put in. Also, after watching the whole show I found that its genre was not very defined, at times it felt like the supernatural action anime that it should be, and then by the next episode I felt like I was watching a slice of life. Another point I have to criticise is the fact that many points in the plot aren't explained until much later on, sometimes leaving me confused as to why what is happening is happening, and some points aren't explained AT ALL. However, despite it lacking a bit it was still interesting and enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nLike I'd expect, the art coming from Kyoto Animation did not disappoint. The overall style of the art was great and I found that the character designs of the main characters were quite imaginative and memorable. The action scenes looked amazing, with both vibrant colours and also fluid animation, and the show had beautiful backgrounds that remained detailed both normally and during fights. Overall, there's not really anything I can criticise here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nOverall I found the sound in Kyoukai no Kanata pretty awesome. I loved the opening and ending, as they both had interesting visuals but also a great song that personally I believe fit it perfectly. The voice actors were good, being able to show different emotions with conviction, and the characters had unique and memorable voices for the main cast. As for the soundtrack, to be honest I was too immersed in the show to really notice or appreciate it. Re-watching parts though, I found that the musical score was pretty good although nothing outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nAlthough the fetishes may put some people off, I think that the characters are pretty good and interesting to watch. The lead characters, Mirai and Akihito, have mysterious backgrounds which are explored through the course of the series and their relationship is developed as well. However, for character development this is pretty much as far as it goes; the other characters don't really change too much and lose some character depth because of this. One thing I have to point out is that there are a lot of characters in this show who had different motives, but in the end they never really explain the reasoning behind the motives and it leaves you feeling unfulfilled. Despite that, I still found the characters overall quite intriguing and good to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nFor me, the combination of amazing art, great sound and interesting plot allowed me to really enjoy the show. I gave it a 10 despite its flaws because I feel it really is worth watching and enjoying.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nTo sum up, Kyoukai no Kanata, like all anime, has good points and bad points. However, I think that the great presentation, art and compelling plot make up for the bad points. I would recommend this to people who are open minded and like a good mix of action, fantasy and slice of life, as if you like those things you will really enjoy this show.\\n\\n\r\nMy personal advice if you want to properly enjoy this anime is to try not to focus too much on the slightly weak plot and just let yourself be absorbed into the show, as in the end the plot and characters are all very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, and I hope this helped!",

            "content": "Kyoukai no Kanata started as something that I was very excited about. It had a good premise that I felt like promised a lot of stuff. However, over the course of the show I never really felt like they were able to progress the story well enough for it to be something that delivered on what it could have been. \r\nThat said, I do not feel like I wasted my time watching Kyoukai no Kanata\r\nArt\r\nThe animation was fantastic. This will be the show that I point to as the gorgeous staple of what high quality animation can and should be. The art style also fitvery well into the world that it existed in. Bright, happy colors existing beside the darker shades did an excellent job of matching up with what Akihito said at the end of the show, \"There will always be darkness in the light, but the night is not without light too.\" Or something like that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nRegrettably, the show often fails to take itself seriously enough for the characters to reach their full potential. Most of the characters showed potential to be rich and fulfilling; they could very easily have a good show into a fantastic one, but the characters often were dragged down by jokes or by being cute. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy light hearted fluff that these characters often were just as much as the next guy, but when the potential to be something so much more than just fluff is there then I feel like I got cheated out of greatness.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI loved the music in this series. The closing song in particular stands out in my mind. The way many episodes would end and fade into the credits was one of the high points of the show. It does a good job of capping of each episode in a way that is satisfying and as poignant as the episode allowed itself to be.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching Kyoukai no Kanata. I started watching it after the first 11 episodes had aired so I was able to knock it all out over a weekend and then waited for the finale. I did not feel like it took any serious investment on my part and that was definitely for the best. In a show like that this one that so closely misses the mark of being fantastic I can appreciate it as a lazy, watch-it-all-in-a-weekend kind of show. I would recommend Kyoukai no Kanata to anyone who  wants to watch a goofy, fun little show with the warning that that is all that it will be: a goofy, fun little show.",

            "content": "As a KyoAni show, Kyoukai no Kanata or Beyond the boundary was a strange show to me. Usually they can pull together a show were slice of life and character drama works amazing, such as Clannad or its recent Sound! Euphonium. However, this is a particular case in which the drama didn't feel in the right place.\r\nMy main problem with the series was that I couldn't take it seriously. It tried to be dramatic, it tried to pull some heartstrings, but almost none of it didn't work. Why? Because it felt rushed sometimes and mostly because it was for the most part a Slice ofLife show. The best moments of the show were when the characters were having fun and weren't taking things seriously. Even the fights were packed with jokes and funny interactions between the protagonists, especially the fight with the bulb/fruit youmu, which gave us hilarious scenes of Mirai in cute outfit and the complete cast as an Idol group.\\n\\n\r\nBut although I had a lot of fun watching them, the second weak point of the show must be the characters. Mirai was the one who gets most of the development and the best of them all. She is great as a moe character and as heroine. Although at first she had problems due to her past, you can feel how she grows as a character all along the series. Akihito starts off good as well, but doesn't get the development needed to fully comprehend him, and although I didn't have any problems with it, his fetish may turn away some people. The same can be say from Hiromi. His powers are amazing (I particularly liked it when he made shields), but his Sister Complex can be annoying for some. This lead us to the worst character of the show: his sister Mitsuki. During the course of the series, and especially in the first episodes, she tries too hard to be the cold one who likes to be harsh and hurtful during her conversations with her friends, especially with Akihito. However, she's absolutely nothing close to Hitagi Senjouhara, and she does not even fill the shoes of the tsundere character.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, the worst parts of the show end with her, as the animation is amazing and fluid. KyoAni is one of the best companies out there when talking about animation and art, so it wasn't surprising that Beyond the Boundary looked beautiful from beginning to end. The music and sound were good, too. However, the OST didn't stand out as much as the OP (I love Minori Chihara's voice) and the ED.\\n\\n\r\nI had a lot of fun watching this show. It had an interesting story, beautiful animation and great songs, and most of the characters were fun and likeable. However, I liked it more when the show didn't want to be serious. As I've said, the best parts of the anime were when the characters interact with each other, having fun taking down pervert monsters or when Akihito and Hiromi were discussing how perfect Mirai was for them. I particularly liked the relationship between Akihito and Mirai. You could feel how comfortable they felt around each other, especially at the end of the anime, even when the final battle was taking place.\\n\\n\r\nI can't wait to see the mirai-hen movie, as it will most likely give more development for our main characters.",

I enjoyed this show overall but it is not without its flaws.\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nThe story itself is interesting but what went wrong is the pacing of the story. To be honest, I dropped the show after two episodes and only picked it up afterwards, which I am glad I did. It started off light hearted and rather slow, showing a clumsy Mirai fooling around with Akihito, the other main character. As it goes along the story isactually pretty serious and I wish they had shown it earlier to make the show more focused. The story reaches a climax, then there are some funny \"filler\" episodes. But then things deteriorated real fast and not long later comes the end of this 12 episodes series. I enjoyed the funny episodes, but I couldn't help thinking it may be better if they use those screen time to lay out the story fuller. Even at the end there are lots of unanswered question, which I hope they could have at least explained some of them to give a fuller sense of completeness. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have distinctive personalities and are likeable. This show mainly focused on the two main characters, Mirai and Akihito, so there is not a lot of personality development for the side characters. But given the length of this series it can't be helped. For Sakura I find her development somewhat sudden. Nevertheless this is a nice cast. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are nice and the background music is fitting. The voice acting is good. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nTypical high standard Kyoto Animation. The battle scenes are amazing and I really like the use of the colours in this show. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy the show much at the beginning but by the end I was looking forward to the next episode eagerly. I would have given this show a 9 if not for the pacing of the story. \\n\\n",

This is the story of KnK, a story of isolation, fear, love and pain.\r\nWhen reading reviews, I was suprized to find many people didn't like this show. The show focuses on a few main characters in charge of protecting the city from monsters called youmus. These charecters have a variety of different powers, from weaponry, combat skills, to more supportive roles. This is capturing and interesting, but the show doesn't stop there, It takes a closer look on a young girl with a special power, who has spent time wallowing in the stigma attachedto it. You see how she changes, improves, and learns solitude is a crutch throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nThis show isn't the best show I've ever seen, nor is it close, but it is one of the better ones out there. The charecters are really fantastic, each is unique, quirky, and has their own goals and aspirations. They may fit some common themes, but they do it well. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is amazing, as expected from Kyoto. The charecter models are cute, and clean, making them easy to look at and caring actual humanism. The fight scenes are impeccable, some of the best i've seen in a long time. Many scenes and backdrops are also quite fantastic, and eye catching.\\n\\n\r\nStory line although simple is engaging. Our 4 main characters all get appropriate screen time, you learn their stories, and see their struggles or successes. We learn about both their powers and talents, but also their normal hobbies and lifestyles. This leaves for a nice experience, as characters feel well rounded, while you also can recognize who is feeling what, and how different characters may approach different situations. \\n\\n\r\nSound was good, but less remarkable to me compared to many of the other aspects. I just found the art and characters to be a far larger driver for my enjoyment of the show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, KnK is a truly immersive show. You feel for the charecters, admire the art, and see a unique twist on isolation and branching out of one's niche.  I awarded this show an 8, and place it as one of my favorites. It may not be for everyone, but if you are willing to give it a shot beyond 3-4 episodes, I feel you may find a truly remarkable show hidden in the rough. Hope you have a pleasant viewing experience!",

            "content": "Kyoukai no Kanata in a sense sticks out like a sore thumb when it's compared to other Kyoto Animation works. It's not the fact that there's action because there was action in Chuunibyou and it still fits. To many, people love Kyo Ani for stressing points in everyday life and making them beautiful. That's more of a personal thing but there's more.\r\nStory: The general idea of killing youmu was honestly one that I could get used to. It made sense how it connected Mirai the other characters. However, the romance between Mirai and Akihito seems forced especially if you think of Mirai's main objective whichI will not spoil. All I really wanted was a little more development. And even though this series is only 12 episodes, I've seen studios develop their characters more in this amount of time than a series with 50 episodes. And to top it all off, there was an irrelevant episode which was just an excuse to let the cute characters sing and dance.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The fact that Kyoukai no Kanata is a Kyo Ani anime is enough to know that's it's gorgeous. The color palette they used is very mellow but can also pop out in action scenes because of all of the shades of red they use. But that's it. Whenever I think of this show, the first thing that comes to mind was\"It was really pretty\" which is good in anime, but shouldn't be your selling point.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening theme of Kyoukai no Kanata was honestly dramatic and mellow enough to be fitting of a show that's supernatural and slice of life. The ending is competing with the Kiznaiver ending for my favorite of all time, and the soundtrack was lovely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters is what I really have a problem with. After completing this series, I can easily say that I found Akihito to be more interesting than the main protagonist, Mirai Kuriyama. Other than the fact that she was this cute megane girl who had a very cool weapon, I don't remember much about her. Akihito Kanbara and his friend, Hiroomi Nase are still kind of off. It seems that as time progresses, less and less anime have unforgettable characters. I've watched anime years ago and I still remember the personalities of side characters. Hiroomi is basically just some other supernatural guy who has a sister complex. His sister, Mitsuki, I found even more boring. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Watching the show was nice for my aesthetics, however , I found myself wanting more. So it was a somewhat bland and dare I say, \"unpleasant\" experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Kyoukai no Kanata was expected to be Kyo Ani's first dark anime but ended up falling flat on its claim and at sometimes could turn in to pure moe blob. The show isn't particularly bad, it was just disappointing despite its potential. if you're looking for a show about a cute girl fighting, then this one is for you.",

The start is pretty interesting and I did enjoy it, there was just something 'generic' in a sort of sense about it. It's not something I can really describe, it's more or less I feel I've seen it before. It doesn't really take away much fromthe enjoyment, but it makes it so it doesn't stand out far from the rest. This can be pretty much applied to the rest of the story as well, as it doesn't seem to stand out but still is interesting. And the end (without spoiling) is just really dumb with some glorious plotholes.\\n\r\nStory (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful and the character designs are also really good, the mc looks like a casual dude, yknow who looks like would be cool to hang out with, which I think is fine, but I feel isn't really up my alley because it contrasts with his personality, which is far from normal (also it may be so people can imagine them in his place, which is not what I'm looking for in an anime). They really make Mirai (the 'main' girl) look beautiful in this anime, and that coupled with the animators' ability to express emotions makes out for some really fun/cute moments. The sound design is pretty good, it accentuates the scenes and helps the emotional scenes aswell. The OP and ED are really good. Especially the really chill ending song coupled with the visuals gives a real 'feelgood' ending to the episodes, comparable to like lofi hip-hop songs.\\n\r\nArt (9/10) probably the best part of the anime\\n\r\nSound (9/10) just really nice\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are probably the worst aspect of the show, though it doesn't bring the enjoyment of the show down that much. I like how both Akihito (the mc) and Mirai both learn and bond together through their isolation and create this sort of connection with one another as they can understand how each has felt. I liked Mirai, she was cute, considerate and seemed pretty interesting. She wasn't a super in-depth character, but yknow I still liked her. Now Akihito was just pretty bad tbh, towards the end he became kinda mysterious and interesting in his origins but in terms of his personality, he really didn't have one. He was kinda bland and super repetitive with his 'glasses fetish', which honestly defined his whole character, which ruined his character for me. Even the last line of the whole series was just him referencing glasses, like wtf I don't care if you have a glasses fetish mate that's the least important thing I want to know about you, oh wait that's the only information we know about you? ok then. But he did make some good jokes which honestly made me laugh pretty hard but not enough to redeem him imo.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's this other girl Mitsuki, which I didn't mind, she's pretty much just an arsehole but Akihito deserved it. And Hiromi the friend of Akihito, isn't really a friend, or I didn't get that vibe. It looked like they had no chemistry, and he was forced to be his friend cause plot reasons. Plus he has a sister fetish ... and tells his sister that he has a sister fetish ... like that's not the most disturbing thing ever.\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10) worst aspect of this anime, mainly just repetitive bullshit.\\n\\n\r\nI think for this anime you shouldn't have great expectations for the experience, if you're looking for a masterpiece, this ain't it (chief). But if you're looking to turn your brain off for a chill time with an action/romance anime of a cute girl, a little bit of drama and some nice action scenes, then this anime is pretty much up your alley.\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) just a fun experience\\n\r\nOverall (7/10), not a great show, but a fun show",

            "content": "Watch episode 6 of this anime. Most of the time the anime bored, but not episode 6. Hell no. Watch it. You don't even need to know so much about the rest of the series, it's a good stand-alone episode. But I guess you just could watch rest of it while you're on it.\r\nBuuut you might get bored like me. I can't really pin down what bothers me. I think it is the drama of the series. The characters should have tragic backstorys, and these also should lead to their misery and inner conflicts nowadays. And the big flaw of the series is the nonexistenceof these problems. Every time I watch them do things casually in their life they seem to have a great time and everything seems to be good. But out of nowhere they act like they are having a bad time and lot of things are shit. I think you see my point, character drama and world doesn't match. And the it becomes boring.\\n\\n\r\nThat's probably the reason why I like episode 6 so much. There isn't drama. They all just have a great time while struggling with a problem. Konosuba like. It's great!\\n\\n\r\nAlso other things that bothered me: The villain. He's just there to laugh maniacally and drive forward the fake drama of the characters. Also our protagonist seems to me kinda like a wish-fullfilment fantasy. After the motto \"I'm so cool I'm always right\". Not that extreme but still, I see it in him.\\n\\n\r\nBut he's not always like that. His bromance with one of the character is really entertaining and fun to watch. It feels real too. Too bad they don't get so much screen tim together to live it out. But honestly, SO much anime would be better if the two main guys turned out to be a gay couple. This one is no exception.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I liked about this anime is (of course....) the animation. Very cool effects work is being done here. It's soooo pretty. Also I love the colors. The main girl looks awfully cute because of it. Although I found the anime very boring the visual are the reason why I sat through the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nBut after all, the show is mostly unpleasent.\\n\\n",

            "content": "WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS!\r\nKnK definitely exceeded my expectations, but it still did not come out on top for me. This anime is very enjoyable, containing lots of action and an interesting plot, but there were a few different routes that I wish would have been taken.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story isn't completely original. There are \"Spirit World Warriors\" that fight yokai, collect the stone they receive from defeating each one, then cash them in to make a living. The Nase family, a prominent family in the anime, became wealthy through this, or so I gathered. Akihito, the main character, is best friends with two siblings from the Nasefamily. Akihito is an immortal half-human half-yokai being that the Nase family keeps a close eye on. Akihito's friends are ordered to kill him if his yokai self surfaces, but gets out of control (Apparently he can be killed if his powers are weakened. So does that really make him immortal...?)\\n\\n\r\nOne day, Akihito meets a girl named Mirai Kuriyama, who basically introduces herself by stabbing him in the stomach, and Akihito kindly asks her to remove it from him. She tries to kill him several times, but is obviously unsuccessful. Mirai is a member of a \"cursed\" clan of Spirit World Warriors that use blood manipulation to defeat yokai.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem I had with the plot is how they chose to reveal everything about Mirai. For example, how did she know Akihito was immortal in the first place? We don't find this out until an episode or two before the final episode. She had been meeting with a member of the Nase family frequently because help was needed to kill Akihito, but Mirai was almost never shown speaking to her. The Nase family had tried to kill him once before when he lost control, but the person in charge of taking him down nearly died. Thus, Mirai was asked to aid in the murder of Akihito, but of course, she ends up not wanting to kill him for various reasons. In my opinion, a more gradual approach to revealing what Mirai was involved with rather than all at once would have been better.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the yokai themselves, there is only one other person that is considered as a villan in the anime, and man is he unlikable. I hated him from his first appearance. You could tell that he was up to something from the very beginning, and that he was going to turn on the Nase family and cause all of the Spirit World Warriors and Akihito to be involved in quite a mess.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe animation is good for the time that the anime came out. It is aesthetically pleasing to look at with its smooth animation and its overall nice color palette. The fighting scenes were nice; the characters had a variety of movement in their attacks that wasn't completely rehashed throughout the series. I don't give it a 10/10 simply because I think there were some scenes that could have been animated better and that were a bit rushed, but overall it was some beautiful animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 \\n\r\nTo be honest, I wasn't paying much attention to the sound at points, but from I can remember, it was good. Obviously, it wasn't all that memorable, but I enjoyed the opening a lot and the ending was decent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters weren't completely unique. Akihito and Hiroomi, one of Akihito's friends in the anime, are the usual perverts with specific likes. Akihito loves girls in glasses, and Hiroomi has a little sister complex, which his sister Mitsuki detests. Other than that, most of the characters have fairly likeable traits. All the characters truly care about each other (aside from all of the teasing) and want to protect each other as much as possible. Mirai, too, is pretty likeable, though she may be a bit bland, but I had a soft spot for her throughout the anime for my own silly reasons.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10\\n\r\nThe reason I'm giving this a 10/10 is that I did not get bored. I was left confused at times, but I was engaged the whole time. It was interesting enough to hold my attention and watch it when I had the chance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nThis anime is very likeable despite a few things that I had to pick at. The action scenes and the story, although not original, kept me watching. The characters were likable and so was the animation. I enjoyed the banter the characters had back and forth at each other. It made for some good comedic relief, although it was a bit inappropriately inserted at times.\\n\\n\r\nA few other minor things that I'd like to mention:\\n\r\n-The fact that Sakura and Mirai made up rather quickly bothered me. Mirai murdered Sakura's sister Yui, and Sakura was after Mirai for half of the anime, but they made up so quickly after one of their fights that I found it odd.\\n\r\n-Akihito's mom is just plain weird. Enough said.",

            "content": "Kyoukai no Kanata is an anime that I highly recommend. The plot and events in history reflect what a person seeks: Unpredictability!\r\nEverything that happens is unpredictable, just like the characters are. I admit that I was amazed about the ending that is not clear and understandable, but from episode 1 to episode 11 it's all wonderful!\r\nNow I pass to the description of the votes I have assigned:\r\n-The story, as I have just said, is engaging and unpredictable, in a positive sense. Everything has its own logic up to episode 9, where everything is changed. Everything is connected and balanced, except for the final episode thatleaves many doubts: even if a person, who saw the anime, you could give the answer by itself, I prefer the clear endings. So the vote is: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n-The art it is the most beautiful thing of the whole anime. They used an animation to produce this anime that is exceptional! it's the best animation I've ever seen. This type of animation is only seen in animated films with a very high budget. So the vote is definitely 10/10\\n\\n\r\n-The sound is realy beautiful! I've liked the OP and ED a lot, and the other songs in the anime. Nothing to say because my vote is 9/10\\n\\n\r\n-I give the characters 8/10 vote. They are wonderful, have unique personalities and reflect what they should be. I only think that they have accentuated too much their manias (who has already seen the anime will understand well), which are a fundamental part of the soul I recognize, but perhaps they have abused too much. But, apart from that, I consider them also wonderful with their jokes and they know how to entertain the spectator who watches the anime.\\n\\n\r\n-The enjoyment it is another pivotal point of the anime. There are so many jokes and every episode makes you laugh a lot. For this I give 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSo the overall vote is 9/10!!",

            "content": "IF YOU ARE THE KIND OF PERSON WHO LIKES THE STORY COMPLETELY GIVEN TO YOU, YOU WON'T LIKE THIS ANIME. That's the reason why I think the score isn't higher, I think people should be properly warned. This anime deserves a a higher score, that's why I'm making this review. I think if you plan to watch this, just know that a lot of details about the story won't be completely reveled by the end, but they don't badly affect the story by any means, on the contrary! This story's charm is how do you interpret those unexplained mysteries. 'Star Wars a New Hope'is a great example, a window opens and you get to peek at a Universe, the expectador falls in the middle of a story and as you grasp some of it, by the end they don't \"explain\" it to you, but it doesn't matter because the story was told and the unexplained was exactly the charm of it. The story is so well written that even the first line on the first episode ties up the last scene beautifully that you just know they know what they're doing as they were writing.\\n\\n\r\nDON'T WATCH THE MOVIE RECAP!!!! \"Kyoukai no Kanata Movie 1: I'll Be Here - Kako-hen\" completely ruins the story by reversing the way it should be told and spoils it completely. And it's so poorly edited that I don't even think you would understand the story anyways.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has a movie sequel and a OVA prequel\\n\r\nWATCH THIS SERIES BEFORE THE OVA PREQUEL \"Kyoukai no Kanata: Shinonome\", as it was released after the series it's best enjoyed in this sequence.\\n\\n\r\nIf you watch and love this anime I DON'T RECOMMEND THE MOVIE SEQUEL \"Kyoukai no Kanata Movie 2: I'll Be Here - Mirai-hen\", it lowers my overall score for the franchise as I felt the plot was pushed into a stupid direction just to have an unnecessary sequel. The movie doesn't answer the doubts of the series, on the contrary, you'll end up even more confused as they don't even throw 'mysteries' at you anymore but full on plot holes with no explanation. The only thing worth on the movie is that the main couple's romance evolves to a full relationship, but because of the circumstances the main Kuriyama Mirai is so out of character that, if you fell in love with her silly but incredibly brave personality, you'll be disappointed. \\n\r\nIf you don't like this series that much maybe you'll like the movie better since it has a higher score?\\n\\n\r\nAnyways this is a review for the 12 episode Kyoukai no Kanata series and I couldn't recommend it more! The story is very refreshing and so are the characters which as you keep watching realize are no clich\u00e9 at all! The main character Mirai is very different from the heroines I've seen since she is not really that ordinary looking, her design is quite unique! She is super clumsy but very talented and very brave, stubborn and sweet, just like her pair Akihito, they are the most perfect for each other characters I've seen, not in  a soulmate way, but in a well written plot way. All the characters in the story are so well written that you feel the story would be incomplete if they weren't there. As  per always Kyoto Animation delivers an amazing fluid animation even on a filler comedic episode which is the best I've ever seen, no exaggeration. The soundtrack is equally amazing.\\n\\n\r\nAs per usual on my reviews I'll throw my YES or NO answers to the questions:\\n\r\n- IS THE ENDING GOOD?\\n\r\n- DOES THE MAIN COUPLE END TOGETHER?\\n\r\n- IS IT WORTH MY TIME? \\n\\n\r\n***If you don't want to know the answers to these 3 questions you should stop reading right now.***\\n\r\nIf you're like me who just want to know if the story is worth your time, go ahead. So with no further ado:\\n\\n\r\nIs the ending good? YES\\n\r\nDoes the main couple end up together? YES\\n\r\nIs it worth my time? YES\\n\\n\r\nIf you like this kind of YES or NO brief review I try to do that for all animes and mangas I've experienced, so you can see a complete list of reviews next to my name just above. \\n\\n\r\nThank you, you're welcome and peace out. ^^",

            "content": "Alright time for my first review. I wanted to fill this with spoilers and use this area for more of a discussion, but I'm supposed to try my very best to not write any spoilers and this isn't a \"discussion area\" so I suppose this review will be spoiler free.\r\nStory 5/10\r\nOther than the art and I guess the sound, this was the most pleasant part of the show, which isn't really a complement. At first the story was fine and it was even intriguing at parts, but by the end it kinda got sloppy and was unnecessarily confusing. I would complain about the plot here,but I don't see how I can without spoilers so I'll just move on.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation 10/10\\n\r\nI mean this anime was made by Kyoto Animation, so there's not much to say here. It was beautiful and I don't really care too much about the art style of anime anyway.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music 6/10\\n\r\nThe sound was fair. Not really anything to write home about, but it certainly wasn't bad. I can't rate the music any higher than a 6 because I didn't even really notice it much throughout the show and I really love and appreciate good music, so that's a disappointment for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 4/10\\n\r\nOh my the characters in this show. 100% they bring the score of this show down for me. They're all so one dimensional and annoying. I guess you could say they are unpleasant. Just like Mirai says 800 times throughout the show. She's cute, but she isn't really anything else. I enjoyed Akihito's character for the most part except when he was being a glasses-loving lunatic. Hiroomi is annoying with his little sister complex much in the same way as Akihito is. I'd say Mitsuki is my favourite character and I like her quite a bit. I hate Sakura's character. I would complain about her \"character development\", but I would consider that as a spoiler so I won't.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\r\nMy enjoyment for this show was all over the place. There were parts that made me laugh, there were many parts that were hard to watch, but it wasn't boring, so I can't rate it as a bad anime. I would have rated it higher, but the end was kinda stupid and there were too many things I hated to be able to rate it above average.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\r\nTherefore, with all of this in mind I have to give this anime a 5. Slice of life is my favourite genre of anime, but it heavily relies on the characters, so if you're looking for a good slice of life anime, look elsewhere. The super natural and fantasy aspects of this show were pretty fantastic actually. They were interesting and if that's enough to get you going than this anime may be perfect for you. Either way, keep enjoying anime!",

            "content": "Kyoto Animation is a Production Studio that recently has been very well known for its cute animation style and very moe influenced shows. They are hated by some people for founding the moe-blob genre and basically being the sole company to make it as popular as it is. But, they are also loved for exactly the same reason, as there are many people (such as myself), that simply fell in love with shows such as K-On and Lucky Star. There are several reasons to why Kyoto Animation rose to popularity, most of them being discussed badly, but there is one undeniable thing about the AnimationStudio itself and that is its unbelievably high production standards! Although there are almost no recent Anime by Kyoto Animation, that included fights or anything similar, the Animation always was incredibly fluent and amazingly detailed! Now imagine... An Anime with these production standards, based around a fantasy fighting premise, with just as much moe as we are used to from KyoAni! Ladies and gentlemen, today's topic is the anime that combines all of that, Kyoukai no Kanata!\\n\\n\nStory:\\n\nThe story of Kyoukai no Kanata is set in a world similar to ours, except that there exist beings called Youmu, which basically are demons that can have any shape or form, ranging from humans, over cats to something along the line of a fruit... There also are those who make their living off fighting exactly these Youmu, by killing them and selling the stones they got out of it. They are called Spirit Warriors and for the most part have some kind of ability as well. The plot itself is about Akihito Kanbara an ordinary high school boy that goes to school like every other person... except for one little twist: he is a half youmu... One day, he stumbles upon a girl that seems to be wanting to jump from the roof of the school he goes to. As fast as he can, he runs up the stairs to confront the girl and after telling her in an epic speech, just how much he loves glasses, she proceeds to stab him, only to find out that he is immortal. The girl, Mirai is a Spirit Warrior and her goal from now on is to kill the immortal Half-Youmu that is Akihito and basically uses him as a punching bag to get better at hunting.\\n\\n\nNow, I guess you can imagine that this is not all the story has to tell, but that there is a lot more behind it than this! However, I am not going to give away anymore than this, as I am a little afraid to spoil anything for you! The story for Kyoukai no Kanata is weird to review... It honestly is nothing too impressive. It starts out strong with an interesting premise that certainly has a lot of potential, but soon takes a little bit of a nosedive! The show forgets to focus on the plot itself, but rather goes in the direction of doing some slice of life stuff that we are so used to seeing from KyoAni. Those episodes for the most part were good for developing the characters and their interactions, but sometimes not necessary. Now don't get me wrong, I didn't enjoy it less, I just think some things absolutely wouldn't have been necessary and they should have rather made those to be an OVA. Anyway, back to topic. The story picks near the end of the show up again and even proceeds to get some feels out of the viewer. The ending of the show is worth noting as well, as it was one of the most satisfying endings that I have seen in a while and while it left a bitter aftertaste for what the characters had to go through, it ends the show in a perfect way and left me, personally, very satisfied! However the show has one more fatal flaw and that is the setting itself. The world on its own is really interesting, but, unfortunately, its potential is not fully used! I might be nitpicking at this point, but I feel like Kyoukai no Kanata is a show that didn't use all of what it could have. It has a lot more potential than what it used, as it didn't explain all of what happened in the world. What exactly are Youkai? Why do the Spirit warriors exist? None of these questions get addressed and I do hope that KyoAni at some point in time decides to actually clear up all those questions and make a second season for exactly that sake! I would be happy about it at least...\\n\\n\nNow for the most part, the show's story really isn't the strongest and it really is not what makes this anime as enjoyable as it is, but it is it's storytelling. The way the story is told, never fails at keeping the viewer interested and always makes him come back for the next episode, even though nothing too interesting happened! It is that, what makes the anime really enjoyable and way better than it should have been! It makes the show a lot more fun to watch and with an ending such as the one Kyoukai no Kanata presented, it certainly concludes as a rather average plot line, that has excellent execution.\\n\n7.4/10\\n\\n\nCharacters:\\n\nFor the characters of Kyoukai no Kanata, it basically is the same as for the story. Most characters are only a variation of stereotypes and none of them are really original! Our main protagonist Kanbara Akihito at first is one of the blandest main characters that I have seen so far. He starts off as your generic Light Novel main characters, as he seems to only exist for the purpose of helping people. He doesn't really have any further motives other than \"I want to help you\" at first. However, it is not until a short time into the show that this changes. We get to know more about him and we can get attached to him. He even does develop a little bit and even though the development, by far is not the best one and not the biggest one that I have seen so far, I can safely say that it was enough to keep me interested in him and I didn't see any need to develop him more than he was. Some people might only see him as the glasses-loving douche bag, but honestly, I thought he was a lot more than that!\\n\\n\nThe second main character is Kuriyama Mirai. She is the character that fits the best in KyoAni's concepts, as she is the moe induced, glasses wearing moe, clumsy moe stereotype and fills that role surprisingly well. Just as for Akihito, she is rather generic to begin with and at first doesn't really have too much of a character but more of a stereotype attached to her. But we get to know her over the course of several episodes dedicated to her and her relationship with others. She starts to develop as well and becomes just as Akihito a memorable character that can stand on it's own, without being a mere moe stereotype.\\n\\n\nThe side characters for Kyoukai no Kanata all are rather interesting, the most notable being the two siblings Hiromi and Mitsuki, which both do get a fair bit of focus but not nearly as much development. The two of them are  a lot of fun to watch whenever they are on screen, with Hiromi having a little sister fetish and not being hesitant about showing that. The other side characters all get a little focus, but nothing too important and while they all have their stereotypical roles, again, that is totally fine, as they all are fun to watch!\\n\\n\nKyoukai no Kanata in total does not have a single ground-breaking characters. None of them are too innovative, but all are stereotypes that have been used pretty often before. However, the show is completely fine that way! In the same way as the storytelling is executed in such a good way, that the story suddenly got a lot better, the characters get a lot better through how well everything around them is written. What KyoAni is by far best at is writing character interactions. One can argue against K-On or Haruhi however much he wants, it is undeniable, that the interactions of the characters are either hilarious or at least well written. Even in Kyoukai no Kanata, KyoAni doesn't fail at that point, but makes the characters really likeable by letting them interact with each other. I think that without his Mirai, Akihito might have been the bluntest character of all time and that without Akihito Mitsuki would have been the most generic tsundere ever. A character cannot shine if it doesn't interact and that is what KyoAni is able to pull off again and again. They understand how to recycle a stereotype that they have been using for ages and make it feel fresh over and over again. People can see that it in K-On, Kyoukai no Kanata and heck, even Free! to some extent uses the same stereotypes only in a male field. The characters don't need to be completely original as long as they feel that way. That is the secret of the character cast behind Kyoukai no Kanata.\\n\n8.4/10\\n\\n\nAnimation:\\n\nAs I already mentioned several times, Kyoukai no Kanata has been done by Kyoto Animation, a production studio that is well known for it's extremely high production standards and as it was to be expected, Kyoukai no Kanata looks damn amazing! The fight scenes are some of the most fluent I have ever seen and even while only in Slice of Life mode, the show looks beautiful. The backgrounds are stunning and the animation is detailed to an extent that lets your jaw drop several times. It is one of the best looking shows I have seen so far and is almost at the point where it would be good enough to receive a 10/10. The only problem I have with it, is that it sometimes while fast paced scenes, relies on still frames. There are a few stylistic still screens, that I can forgive, but sometimes, during fights, I cannot just ignore them.\\n\n9.7/10\\n\\n\nSound:\\n\nThe OST for Kyoukai no Kanata has been scored by Hikaru Nanase, who was also responsible for shows like Scrapped Princess and Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom. The Soundtrack is a mix of happy slice of life tracks and darker drama tracks. While the SoL tracks are rather generic and would fit into almost every happy-go-lucky slice of life show, the drama bits certainly do suit the show really well! They are well composed and part of an OST that in total really compliments the show it is attached to. It might not be as good as let's say Attack on Titan's OST, but it certainly stands its ground against many other shows. \\n\\n\nThe opening for the show sounds rather good being sung by the same artist who did the Gargantia opening and I did like it, but the ending song definitely was a lot better! I am a huge fan of KyoAni endings, ever since I saw Chuunibyou, as they often have a surreal feeling to it, that often even fits the show. For Kyoukai no Kanata that feeling returns and it doesn't disappoint. Coupled with the gorgeous animation from KyoAni, both the opening and ending were brilliant.\\n\n8.1/10\\n\\n\nKyoukai no Kanata has been a fairly enjoyable from the beginning of the show on. It had its downfalls but always has been rather interesting for me. With the cool premise, the amazing animation and the for the most part really likeable character cast, I think that it really did a good job of delivering an enjoyable anime. It might not be perfect and it might not even be amazing at most things, but the way it presents itself is its biggest strength. The plot, really, is not too good, the characters are all stereotypical, but it has a charm that not every anime has and that is what I love about it, but that could just as well be me simply fanboying over my, by far, favorite Animation Studio of all time!\\n\\n\nNow, as I calculated all the scores for Kyoukai no Kanata (being story, characters, animation, sound and my personal enjoyment), I got to an average score of 8.4/10. It is a show that might have its flaws, but certainly does a good job of getting across what it wants to get across. It might not have the best story but succeeds in presenting it. The show, at this point in time, has been licensed by Sentai Filmworks.\\n",

Although I did enjoy watching until the last several episodes.\r\nThe character's background stories were good, but the delivery lacked depth. I couldn't connect with any of the characters. The supporting especially: what were their motives? What drives them? And it felt like the main's lacked these aspects as well--at least, not enough to move me.\r\nThe 2 male characters obsession with their fetishes should've received less attention. The time spent on those things would've been better spent in character development, etc.\r\nThe main premise of the story was very good. I loved all the implications ofthe 2 main characters backgrounds~ however, as I said, it wasn't ended well, and I think the supporting lacked 'important' roles. It could've been written better.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was wonderful though! I loved the action and special effects in the OP! It's the redeeming aspect of the series~\\n\\n\r\nI also loved the OP and ED theme songs. The ED video is especially nice.\\n\\n\r\nI think I'll read the light novel (when I can understand Japanese XD), it might be shed more light on this anime.",

I wish they had started building the plot up sooner or had more episodes because at the end I still found that I had lots of unanswered questions and I didn't really understand much of what happened from episodes 10-12. Also some episodes were slow to get into and I sometimes found it a chore to watch the next episode rather than out of enjoyment. That's notto say it was terrible, I did enjoy it, but I feel it had more potential.\\n\r\nThe art was fantastic, as was the sound. I dont really have much to expand on there. \\n\r\nThe main characters were good. I found Mirai Kuriyama annoying sometimes with her constant calling out of 'Senpai' and 'How unpleasant' but it wasnt a big issue. I liked how they all interacted and it added a light hearted comedy feel when it was needed which I liked. Overall it was good, but not great.",

            "content": "This review only applies for the first 4 episodes of the series, it does not constitute for the overall experience of the anime itself and it will be comprised of what I liked/disliked about the anime and the reason I have had dropped it for.\r\nSo, as for what I actually liked in the series the only thing I can say is the animation. Specifically what I liked about it is the way they approached animating some of the action scenes where for instance there's a saw going through the main girl's blood sword and with blood spraying all over and mostly other stuff involving herpowers. There are still things like overly excessive super flashy powers with colorful bullshit around, you know, things that shows with good animation are often praised for, even when it looks nothing short of generic and just an easy choice overall because when people run out of ideas for what to happen in an action scene, throw in some high budget colors. By this I mean something that looks really flashy to convey something threatening or powerful going on. Because the only way to convey something is powerful is to create super flashy bullshit, especially in something with supernatural powers. Generally the series looked solid outside of the one time where it resolved to doing that, but keep in mind, that I ain't willing to check going forward so... you're on your own if you actually dislike seeing that. I kinda doubt you will, since this is more of a thing that bothers only me.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway... now lets start with what I disliked most about the series. The characters are fucking terrible... This is the cast of characters. Main character, has a fetish for glasses, main girl character, wears glasses, is a klutz, side male character, wants to fuck his sister, which is considered a fetish and the actual sister who is the MC's best friend and can only be defined as a kink shamer. Fucking amazing cast of characters. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the story does try to tell a story, it legitimately does, the personalities of these 4 and the hijinks the story tries to carry through which is basically yo I wanna fuck glasses, yo I prefer my sister, call me onii-chan etc is fucking  appaling. The only time the humor tried a somewhat different joke was when the main character got a call from his mother through magic and she was dressed as a cat girl. Yup... The arc I've seen, which pretty much seems to have settled in these 4 episodes, did develop a relationship between the main character and  girl with glasses which with actual dialogue, could've been interesting because from a story telling perspective, as far as things were laid out, the show knows how to do it. It does. It builds up the backstory of main girl, drew parallels between the main character and her, explained why they would help each other and so on. Of course there are some terrible leaps of logic at the beginning (You're immortal, a girl tries killing you as in she stabs you, you're probably in pain. Who the fuck would talk casually to anyone that does that? Let alone want to help her wholeheartedly with anything?) but the way the relationship developed made sense if you ignore my paranthesis. \\n\\n\r\nBasically the comedy of the show ruins the story but I can see some basics in the way of telling the story are set up in what I've seen and they seem solid. Too bad they're wasted on logic gaps because the world wasn't explained or perhaps poorly thought out and terrible fetishistic comedy that take away from the story. I mean, I suppose that sort of comedy has its audience but you're trying to tell a serious story, at least it looks like you do. And it's not like you can't have comedy and also a serious story, that's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that the story tries to settle a relationship between two characters, of which one understand what the other endures and tries helping them through it and it does this well. All that then is undermined in the next scene where the main character will say \"I wanna fuck glasses yay bifocals woooooooooo\" because realistically, nobody will just all of a sudden be like \"I see this person struggling and I wanna help them because I relate to them.\" to \"Who needs gloryholes when you can fuck someone through glasses with a missing lense?\" without even mentioning your concern for this person to your apparently one and only friend. There are other shows who mostly deal in shenanigans for a while but when things get serious, the story does not underwhelm the seriousness of those things. It does not scoff at them.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the story does have some cliches, but compared to other things, they hardly matter.\\n\\n\r\nThe one other thing I didn't talk about is the sound which I didn't really notice, since the series has the fantasy genre and I played quite a bunch of video games fitting that area, I'll just pin it on that and say the reason I didn't notice the OST is due to that and call it average. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway for the story, I can't really recommend the show to you. But if the fetishistic humor sounds like a plus to you, maybe that will help you with seeing the story in a different way than me. The show isn't ecchi, so don't expect that, expect it only as something meant to be humorous, not sexual. Other than that, I got nothing. The fighting scenes while animated well, that's the only praise I can give them, really. There's no sense of urgency because you already know how they're gonna go or is there anything particularly fresh or exciting about them other than the animation choices. The story I already talked about and yeah. You do you. Ultimately the show's humor didn't phase me and took away from the story that already had some logic gaps.",

            "content": "I'm wring a review for Kyoukai no Kanata because it made a huge impact to me. I had no idea that this anime was going to be amazing. I've been putting it off lately due to reading bad reviews about it, but it seems that people's reviews never match my expectations which led me to watching it. I've been having red eyes the whole time and that makes me happy which tells me that I fully enjoyed this series. Therefore there have been times where I cracked up uncontrollably and times where I had to hide under the covers. I was really confused that theydidn't write romance in the genre as well because i'm sure that would've hiped some people up. I hope you will watch this series with passion and excitement as I have done so.\\n\\n\r\nStory: To put it simply it was amazing. At first I was kind of confused how the plot had anything to do with the title but then it grew on me. I was fascinated at how the author can create such a development. There were cute, beautiful, teary, and funny times. There was never a moment that I wanted to stop watching because I was afraid that I was about to miss something.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It was so freaking beautiful! It kept reminding me of how the real world looks like. Every single aspect of their world was portrayed nicely. I felt like I was in the character's shoes to where I can see everything that's beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nSound: As go for the sound it was great. I gave it a 9 because I felt like it's potential could rise higher. I felt as though it was missing that one something, my guess the surrounding sounds weren't there. As go for the character's voices totally matched my expectations. To think that they could use their emotions while matching their sound is marvelous! I could never ask for more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Each character played a role that made a difference to the whole series. They had moments where they would laugh or cry or be in an unbearable anger that would blow their minds off. The main characters had amazing chemistry though I did hoped that they had more in the middle of the series rather than close to the end. Anywho, the side characters played their part amazingly which also made me happy and satisfied. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I had no idea why but this series was enjoyment the whole time! For some reason I have never encountered a series as this which left me crying during the last for episodes. It was funny as well. Those who (for some reason) give bad reviews for this anime which I wonder why. Everything was plotted wonderfully. It started out well and ended well as well which, I for one, think is how a story should start.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: IT WAS AMAZING AND I'M PRETTY SURE YOU SHOULD WATCH IT NOW!!! hehe, sorry I think it was amazing and I want to share this series to anyone who haven't yet. Thanks for reading! ^.^",

            "content": "\"How unpleasant\" wouldn't be the over-used tag line I would use for this anime, rather I would use the opposite.\r\nKyokai no Kanta (\"beyond the boundary/horizon\") is a fantasy/supernatural central themed with some aspects of slice of life. It turns from quirky, light heart episodes to a plot intensified second half. It is definitely worth your attention and even more so to watch the first few episodes to get a gist of it.\r\nNOTE: This review can be perceived as subjective for certain aspects of the review, but I will try to make it as objective as possible. \r\n[Story (7/10)]\r\nThe plot of KyoAni is very promising andhas a lot of potential - a world inhabited by 'youmu' and spirit world warriors. Although it being interesting and holding potential it is unfortunate to say it was executed poorly, given the side \"fillers\" where it reverted back to its slice of life and comedic scenes, it took away the much needed time to properly depict the many questions that arise with the series.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the series does give you a kick in the face as the plot thickens the further you go into the anime where everything starts connecting together and makes you think \"that makes so much more sense now.\"\\n\\n\r\n[Art (10/10)]\\n\r\n>Animation: (5/5)\\n\r\nSomething which is usually hard to notice is how smooth and fluid the animation in KyoAni is. The fight scenes are very good and once again, consistent which should be a buying factor for any good animations. Even the character interactions contain small things like body language instead of the typical eyes widening. Definitely one of the stronger points, and this point is further reinforced by its outstanding art style.\\n\\n\r\n>Art: (5/5)\\n\r\nThe scenery, the characters, the colours and the consistency - KyoAni absolutely blasts away everything and inspires me as a hobbyist digital artist with its superior style of art and the consistency of detail put into all scenes of the anime. It's extremely pretty at almost all points of the anime - given the fact it IS an animation where having 'outstanding' art constantly is something not you see in everyday animation.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound (8/10)]\\n\r\n>Music (4/5)\\n\r\nThe music is very fitting to each scenes, although it doesn't make you fall in love and force you to find it and download it - it certainly does its job of setting the mood. Properly matching the composition of instruments to each scene - soft for more emotional, upbeat for action and etc. I also enjoy it when they soft fade the closing of the episode with the opening of the \\n\\n\r\nThe opening wasn't too much of a pulling factor for me, it was enjoyable without blatantly spoiling anything major in the plot (something I see a lot of anime's do..)\\n\r\nThe ending I found to be one of the most beautiful endings I've seen in a while. This is very subjective but I enjoyed the style it portrayed with the deeper meaning towards certain symbols showed. They really held their head high and showed off what they can do and compose beautiful art, beautiful animation with the support of awesome music. It's worth noting that I'd watch the ending through: something I never do unless it's worth listening/watching.\\n\\n\r\n>Voice Acting (4/5)\\n\r\nI feel like the voice acting has been done very well in the sense that the voices are distinctive in their own rights. They portrayed emotions well enough, when asserting rage or expressing sadness - props to the voice actor/actresses.\\n\\n\r\n[Character (7/10)]\\n\r\nCharacter's in the series were something that I found to be better than what I've expected. The development albeit minimal due to aforementioned 'slice of life filler episodes', was sub-par at best but managed to get out what they could. But an extreme positive was the character dynamics and interactions. Each character show uniqueness and distinctiveness which branches out from the 'generic' group, where they all have strange, very strange (glasses...) personalities, but still manage to get warm interactions with one another - an enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment (8/10)]\\n\r\nThis is by no means your average of an anime, it has amusing scenes, beautiful scenes, sad scenes and cool fighting scenes. I thoroughly enjoyed the series and if given the chance to watch the sequel I would gladly with no complaints as it holds much potential to the core.",

            "content": "\"How unpleasant\". \r\nKyoto Animation was well known for their anime \"K-On\", \"Hyouka\" & \"Free\". This time, Kyoto Animation made the anime \"Kyoukai no Kanata\" or \"Beyond the Boundary\". Though I really thought that there might be room of improvement for this anime.\r\nSTORY (6):\r\nThe story follows Akihito who rescues Mirai, a Spirit World Warrior, from jumping off the building. And things start to happen. I couldn't explain the details.\r\nBasically, the Spirit World Warriors are humans who are trained to defeat Youmu. Youmu are creatures that attack human. I wouldn't know how they evolve.\r\nThe best part was when in episode 6, the youmu explodes in yellow liquidafter their performance.\\n\\n\r\nActually, the story never explained about the purpose of youmus and especially how \"Beyond the Boundary\" takes place. The anime just leaves me with more questions unanswered.\\n\\n\r\nART (7):\\n\\n\r\nAs you can tell, the art design is cute just like some people say when \"Kyoto Animation\" creates moe anime. In fact, I like the character designs and the supernatural scenes. They are good. In fact, this anime made use of glasses like Mirai, she wears red glasses and Akihito was astounded by that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (7):\\n\\n\r\nI like the Opening and ending song. The opening is the title of the anime itself by Minori Chihara. The ending is \"Daisy\" by Stereo Drive Foundation. Daisy is like the flower.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (5):\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the weakest part of the show. They never explain what their purpose in life is. We only get to understand Akihito and Mirai better because they are the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly have nothing to say about Akihito. He is just a bland character. He really cares deeply for Mirai and he wants her to believe that Mirai is not alone in this troubled world.\\n\\n\r\nMirai is clumsy but she has determination to fight youmu and protect the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe Nase family are the most interesting part of the show though sadly they didn't get enough showtime unlike compared to Akihito & Mirai.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, I really loved to see what is their purpose in defeating youmu. \\n\\n\r\nI really wished that this anime would try to develop the characters especially Yayoi who is Akihito's mom.\\n\\n\r\nMiroku Fujima, the main villain, was not memorable because I have no back story about what happened to Miroku and Izumi in the past about why Miroku became the villain that he is now.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (6):\\n\\n\r\nBased on my rating, I really couldn't know whether I should hate or like this anime because I really felt that the story could have been better if they just explain about youmu and the characters' objectives.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not that I dislike this show, I feel that it could have been handled better if the characters were given enough time to realize their actions and purpose. Not only that I really love to know the characters' backstory but this anime just only show great action scenes and slice-of-life fanservice and neglects the backstory.\\n\\n\r\nI really love to see how the characters develop. The ending was also very anti-climactic. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, this anime is okay though I wished it could have been better. I also heard that the OVA can address the questions that wasn't answered. I also hope so for the upcoming OVA.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you are a KyoAni fan, you probably might find something you might like in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo I will give it a 6 out of 10.",

            "content": "An awesome anime from KyoAni. Kyoukai no Kanata has everything you can expect from a romance, comedy, action, supernatural anime and it fulfills everything to the maximum. I've seen this series 3 times and still watch it when I have the time. It's animation is superb so you never get bored of it, it's got a good opening and ending song as well as an insert song. It's got awesome characters and nice action scenes.\r\nStory 9/10:\r\nExterminators have the duty of ridding this world of demons. Though it may seem kinda dark from this but it's not. The demons are just your everyday pest and arenot around to take over the world. But a very strong demon is present in Kanbara Akihito and Kuriyama Mirai is called to exterminate him. It's just that he is immortal. So, there daily life is filled with comedy, romance, and some fights. And let's add some unique friends and family to the situation and you've got an amazing anime. Though, not much is told about the past and future about the demons and exterminators but I don't think this is that type of anime. It's just for enjoyment and it does it's job perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10:\\n\r\nKyoAni everybody. What else do you expect except state of the art character designs, backgrounds and animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10:\\n\r\nNice opening and a lovely ending. As well as an insert song \"Future Star\" that shows in one episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10:\\n\r\nThe main protagonist, Kanbara Akihito, has a fetish for girls with glasses.\\n\r\nHis friend, Hiroomi Nase, is a siscon. They both have their own funny routine as well.\\n\r\nKuriyama Mirai, a bespectacled beauty, a strong exterminator and a romance interest.\\n\r\nMitsuki Nase, the sister of Hiroomi and the only one with a cool head. \\n\r\nEach character has their own special power which makes it interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSome other characters like Izumi Nase make the series a thousand times better. And some bad guys too which look pretty damn cool if you ask me. The past of Mirai and Akihito is briefly shown but more focus is given to Mirai. \\n\r\nSince it's 12 episodes, most of the characters just appear and don't have much of a background but don't worry, they all have their own unique personality that makes the anime really amazing and gives a new surprise in each episode. New characters are introduced and some past friends are also visited to make the experience more deep.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nFrom the start to the end, there is not one moment where I got bored. Each episode is filled with comedy that makes you laugh and action scenes that get you pumped up. Superpowers in this anime are really nice and fights range from one on one combats with demons and other exterminators to large scale battles with multiple allies and enemies. Some episodes are also dedicated for the development of the relation between the characters and after all the action and heartbreak, a happy ending is just what everyone needs giving this anime a perfect ending.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is an anime I would recommend to anyone. I don't care what genre you prefer, this anime is awesome for anyone. I've recommended it to many friends and have gotten amazing feedback. DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS ANIME.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "STORY:\r\nThe story of Beyond the Boundary is really touching and lovable. I thought it was unique for a romance anime, and especially enjoyed the amazing action that isn't usually associated with anime under the genres of romance, comedy and slice of life. The storyline was wonderful however I thought the climax and its explanation was a little rushed and had a few plot holes, not to mention I believe the ending was quite far fetched and didn't make much sense but I was still happy with how the story ended. The explanations of what was going on was a little brief and I found myselfre watching some parts to get whats going on; despite that, I really loved the concept of the story. \\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe art in this anime was very beautiful and typical of Kyoto Animation. I loved the attention to detail and thought the fight scenes were very well animated which I didn't expect at all. I found myself shocked at how stunning alot of the scenes were during battles.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nThe sound is fairly good, I really liked both the opening and ending and thought they were both very well composed. The background music was good but not exactly memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nConsidering its such a short anime with a fairly complex story line, they did a good job of giving characters depth. Unfortunately I didn't get a lot of background from some of the characters I wanted to know more about, for example Mirai Kuriyama and Akihito Kanbara, but I would blame this fault on the short run the series was given.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nThere wasn't a moment of BtB I didn't enjoy, I was constantly laughing at the antics of the four main characters or feeling the sheer emotion towards the end of the anime. I really enjoyed the series and never found a dull moment. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nOverall I believe BtB is an amazing anime, prior to watching the anime I had heard quite alot of fuss over this series and was ready to be slightly disappointed by the anime but I really wasn't, it lives up to all the praise I've heard from many fans. The anime has a nice balance of multiple genres making it different from your average romance, comedy, slice of life. I'll definitely be re watching this in the future and will recommend it to any fantasy lover!",

            "content": "Kyoukai no Kanata, while amazing in artwork and having a promising story, does have its faults, which I will reveal first.\r\nWhile I said the story is promising, the way the anime actually went about it was poor. Humor is widely used to break the tension, and while it normally would succeed, Beyond the Boundary happened to force in the comedy where it just wouldn't fit. At times, it does fit perfectly, but then they decide, \"Hey, we already started, why don't we push it even further?!\" and break the purpose of comedic relief. Now, the actual story did benefit from the bit of humor, butthe jokes oftentimes became overused. \\n\\n\r\nContinuing on, the actual concept behind the anime is pretty amazing. When applied, however, everything was smashed together in a smorgasbord of choppily rushed episodes. I imagine that if they were to remake it all utilizing two seasons, they would have been able to use the full extent of such a grand concept. The last four episodes were just the epitome of \"We're out of time, hurry up!\" Not only do they oftentimes leave you confused by what's happening, sometimes they start you off confused as well. And it isn't a \"deeper meaning\" confusion; no, this confusion is simply due to the lack of details and events, all while mixing this together in a disorganized mess.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the art: The cuts in-between scenes are very rigid, making it feel like just an automatic Powerpoint presentation transitioning through the slides after the content finished playing. Apart from this terrible way of transitioning, the artwork itself is quite beautiful. The characters, although not overly unique in their design, do have quite a bit of detail placed into them. The environment is well drawn, and the animation is pretty good. At times it does lose its smoothness, but it tends to stay pretty consistent at 720p and even 480p.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the characters and their personalities are a different story. There are few epiphanies, and even fewer developments. The only characters who seem to truly grow, rather than simply gain the ability to call each other friends, are Akihito and Kuriyama. Even then, it's just watching two selfishly depressed teenagers going through their lives together. The characters also act very predictably, and it is easily noticed who has secrets, who actual is an antagonist, and who actually knows what's going on.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the only truly redeeming feature of this anime is the art, I did greatly enjoy this. So much, in fact, that I personally rank it as an 8, despite the overall objective 6 here. If you're looking for something really nice to watch, then by all means, go ahead. I would definitely rewatch this myself. Simply knowing that it has great potential from the start is just fantastic food for thought, allowing the mind to run rampant with what could have been if this anime weren't so rushed. However, if potential is not your forte, and you'd prefer not having to think about what could have been, then, unless art can win you over, I would avoid this.",

Not once but twice!\r\nThe first part of the season was relaxed and introducing the characters, all fine but ridiculous at times. During the second part we learned that what we were led to believe in the first part was not true and some of the main characters' reactions so far was revealed to be a trick on us watchers for a more engaging story up to that point!\r\nBy the way, it feels like three separate arc barely fitting together. First they introduce characters, second arc they realize they forgot one character, the third arc iswhat I consider the real story.\\n\\n\r\nAlso I don't want to spoil anything about the ending, but how the fuck?! We got tricked for the second time!\\n\\n\r\nThere are also a lot of loose threads which go unexplained all the way through this season.\\n\\n\r\nFor all its faults, this show is still mediocre or just below. I've seen a lot worse and this show did have beatiful art, fitting songs and it did amuse me enought to watch all of it.",

I really enjoyed parts of this anime, but in the end, I feel bad I watched it.  So many things are not really explained well, when explained you just feel bad.  \r\nOn KA some said this was great, 10/10.  So I decided to watch it.  I'm not sure if this anime could have been great.  Maybe if they made it two seasons instead of one and filled in the missing pieces, giving a more clear pictureof what is actually happening and logically advance the plot  it may have been better.  \\n\\n\r\nI feel the creators of this anime just threw things together, maybe in their mind they had filled out the backstory and they could see a great plot.  The plot has too many holes.  They do make an effort to explain things the last couple episodes but they fail and it just comes off as being crap.\\n\\n\r\nI call BS on how they end it.  I want to give it a 1 rating, however I did enjoy parts of it.  Do yourself a favor and skip this anime.  However, if you have no brain, love seeing random action, then you will watch this and think it is a 10.  To the creators of this anime, Screw You.",

            "content": "This, by no means was a good anime and the only reasons keeping it that way is the lack of or complete lack of emphasis on the importance of plot and character development. I don\u2019t feel like this is a bad anime either, the visuals and sound plus many others things shows that the studio actually puts an effort into this anime.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nOk, how do I even begin? This is a 12 episodes anime which in today\u2019s anime industry isn\u2019t very long. And how did they manage the use of those precious times? By adding filler like episodes that serves no purpose at plot andcharacters development but solely for shits and giggles. The studio would\u2019ve like to think that the extra irrelevant stories are for the audience and the character itself to grew attached to each other. But no, as far as I see the overused comedic effects does not helped and all this wasted times could\u2019ve being used to explain more important matters such as more expansive details on character\u2019s background. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 8/10\\n\r\nWhen it goes with the art and sound, this anime is by far the best I\u2019ve ever seen. The use of lighting adds on the mood and suits the situation. In addition the soundtrack that was used also adds on either a relax and happy feeling or a sense of danger and urgency. The studio\u2019s attention to details are also noted on each of the characters, making them diverse and easy to identify with their personality clearing printed on their looks. I absolutely love how versatile the character was when their emotion changes. Like Akihito\u2019s mother, both her serious and goofy side reflects well on her face despite them being miles apart.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nDespite the appearance of the character is being given extra attention. The development of each is being completely ignored. From the beginning to the end, each and everyone of main and side character experience zero to no dynamic changes and the only one I could think of is Mirai\u2019s acceptance to her grief and despair of killing her best friend. Other than that the characters feels one sided and their personalities are being made from a mold; the movie did a much better job.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI\u2019ve be lying if I said I didn\u2019t had a good time watching this anime. Despite majority of the story being wasted on non plot important content. Those moments are absolutely the cutest and desirable for people to enjoy. It\u2019s safe to say the the movie delve in more on the side that is lacking in the series, but also loses the essential part that is slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nI would\u2019ve recommend this anime to you if you like SAO where the archetype is essentially the same. If you are also looking in for the best waifu material, mirai is definitely the go to choice for you.\\n",

Stories cannot relay on one single aspect of the whole thing, they must pay attention to every little detail in order to make a great, or at least memorable experience. \r\nThe show started amazingly good, with that incredible Akihito's narrative, the awesome rhythm and stunning animation, but somehow they lost it along the way and unfortunately couldn't develop well pretty much anything. Neither the characters nor the plot, not even the side stories. And suddenly it became one...more...episode... A whole pack of cliche with a pinch of good artwork. I think I'd probably wouldn'thave finished it, if it didn't only have 12 eps.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all likable, but there isn't almost any backstory for nobody. Just a few mentions about their parents and stuff and then they decide you'll figure out the rest.\\n\r\nI like shows that make you think, some people might complain on shows that don't deliver all info chewed up to them, but my only problem is when the show doesn't deliver anything at all to you. This one is a great example of how an anime can left SO MANY open ends and unexplained things that make even the most careless people to note.\\n\\n\r\nI kept telling myself past episode three that everything was going to get better if I got through those episodes and that I'd probably love the whole thing as it'd come to an end - as I had seen so many people favoriting Mirai-san and so. But no. It didn't get any better, just worse. I'll probably forget pretty much everything about this show by the end of the month, as it wasn't able to grip me.\\n\r\nFor me the worst episode was the tenth. As they only tell the viewer he is not in the wrong episode past 10 minutes.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not a bad show, it's just not what it was supposed to be, it isn't what was promised.\\n\r\nAnd as everything in life that has a bad and a good side, this show is no different. The animation and the whole soundtrack are spectacular. They managed to make a real masterpiece in terms of quality of making an anime, they just couldn't fit the right story into it. \\n\\n\r\nI loved the fight scenes, when Mirai would create that awesome sword of hers and fight everyone. The best moment of the anime, when they managed to put together both animation and sound beautifully good, happened at the end of episode 11. That ending is a real piece of art. Thrilling, emotional, beautiful, awesome.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good thing that is worth repeating is that they managed to make almost every character likable. They all have their personalities and are reliable.\\n\r\nTo sum up, the thing that got this show down was the big plot hole it has, the poor story - as this is the most important part of any anime, show or movie.",

My first attempt was Occult Academy, but that is a topic for another review.\r\nI fell in love with the initial premise of an immortal half demon and a demon slayer with cursed blood meet by fate one day. The action and animation were up to par and I liked the characters and how they established the world they lived inhabit. I quite enjoyed the emotional content as well which should hit home with many an otaku looking for something with heart, wit,& action in a single anime. As much as there is to praise here I'd feel remiss in my duty if I didn't tell you the last 25% of this series bogged down.  \\n\r\n[spoiler]\\n\r\nepisode ten is a recap of the first nine with all the little secrets revealed, setting up episode 11 which was done in the first 6 minutes of episode 10. All of which is so predictable, but could be forgiven had they not sidelined the scobies at the end. And the bad guy didn't die, another everything is back to normal at the end. Which cost it an entire point as the tragic & poignant end is ruined by an American style happy ending that leaves us where we started. Also, I grew annoyed with the rampant use of the word \"senpai\" in this series.\\n\r\nall in all it's seven episodes of quality anime padded out to 12, but I'm a pretty harsh critic many of you should like it more than I...",

I've heard about this Anime, all I knew at first was that its suppose to be a tear-jerker or something and that's it. So after several days of refraining from watching Anime (Its like a cleansed you know) I decided to check it out. \r\n\u2022 First Impression: 9\r\nI didn't do any background check before seeing KNK so I don't know what genre this is, or the synopsis or what studio produced this, but upon seeing it I was like \"Yep. Yep, its KyoAni.\" The first episode gave me simultaneous WTF reactions because of therefreshing twists even up to the end. And then you start to hear the bubbling sound of the ED theme \"Daisy\" by Stereo Dive Foundation which totally set my soul on fire. I am a fan of aesthetic, out-of-this-world visuals and the ED theme was like a cherry on top so I had high hopes after the first ep. \\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Art: 10\\n\r\nThere's no arguing that KyoAni really nails it when it comes to these elements. There's nothing for me to say. Its always whimsical. \\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Characters: 9\\n\r\nCharacters are lovely. KNK gives a refreshing mix of various characters, albeit the fact that some of them are stereotypical. I love the two perverts, especially Hiromi. MCs and SCs have their own struggles and interesting back stories, some surprises tend to unfold as the story progresses so when I got acquainted with everything about these said characters, its a lot easier to convince myself to keep on watching. \\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Story: 3\\n\r\nI think the Creator? Writer? Director?\u2014 whoever the fuck is in charge of the story has perfectly established what \"flow\" he wants the viewers to go with. But then there's a lot of mysteries and questions that were left unanswered. There were also inconsistencies in minor details such as the relatively of the flashbacks to the present scenarios. So many things happened in the story that just suddenly came out of the blue without any given reason or explanation. That's what ruined this for me. I was like \"What is happening? Is it the Anime or did I just become slow in picking up the story. Am I getting dumb because I took a break or what?\". In the end, it wasn't me. (Thank God) It really was just the messed up plot. \\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Overall: 5\\n\r\nIt was half good and half bad. Sound is superb by the way. I like the SFX especially on scenes that look like some kind of horror film. And \"Daisy\" is really, really beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nYou should still watch it tho. I completely discourage the idea of not wanting to see the Anime after seeing other people's bad ratings. I hope this helped.",

It get's a ten in everything for me. The story? Very imaginative. Instead of killing yokai/demons like they do in every other anime the monsters featured in Kyoukai no Kanata were interesting. AndI thought how it was intresting that they turned into those cool rocks and they got paid for it.  The Art? I thought it was beautiful, and the characters were all given quirks in both appearance and personality. It was also very imaginative, the most beautiful scene to me being when you could see the Beyond The Boundary in the sky during the last two episodes.",

Rushing up to stop her, he reveals his attraction to glasses and finds out that Kuriyama is actually a Demon Hunter in training who upon finding out Akihito is immortal chooses him as a training target and \"kills\" him repeatedly.\nThe series plays out following Akihito and Mirais daily lives and their struggles with demons,friendship, rent and whatever it may be. It all leads up to the meeting with the powerful demon \"Kyoukai no Kanata\".\\n\n__________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\nThe art and animation are terrific, as expected from a KyoAni piece of work. When looking, one can spot some parts where the animation goes downhill a bit, but they make up for it with general excellent animation and the art style is very loveable so high praises for that.\\n\n__________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\nIn the OST, there is nothing that especially sticks but they're all pretty average pieces of work.\\n\\n\nThe idol song in the anime, Yakusoku no Kizuna, is pretty decent and the performance is great, but generally I feel like it's not good enough to deserve a lot of praise, though I guess on the flip side it's not worthy of complaint either.\\n\\n\nThe opening is sung by Chihara Minori, who does a great job with the opening turning it into a good and memorable one, however not good enough for \"Kyoukai no Kanata\" (the song's name) to warrant a top spot in my top openings list.\\n\\n\nThe most noteworthy entry among the sound is the ending known as \"Daisy\", sung by Stereo Dive Foundation which is an amazing piece of work both sound-wise and animation-wise. This sticks to your head and stays for quite a while, so kudos for a great song.\\n\n__________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\nThe supporting cast in Kyoukai no Kanata is nothing special so I won't talk about them however the main cast is somewhat interesting.\\n\\n\nKanbara Akihito: The blonde main character who is a half-demon and an immortal, he is a self-proclaimed glasses lover and loves the way Kuriyama Mirai looks with her glasses and states so several times during the show, he's generally a really nice guy trying to help Mirai get contacts, friends and money too live on her own in the town.\\n\nHe spends a lot of time in the literature club with the Nase siblings but during the periods of time demons are active he becomes a bit unstable and causes trouble for everyone.\\n\\n\nKuriyama Mirai: The glasses wearing heroine of the show, who, for various reasons, has to depend on Akihito for help to get herself going as a Demon Hunter, and as with any other KyoAnimation series, she starts developing feelings for our... pervert(?) main character during the course of the series.\\n\nShe might look fragile and weak but she's not to be taken lightly as she's mentally very strong and physically quite agile. She has a thing for bonzais and is a bit skeptical towards most things but opens up as a really warm personality.\\n\\n\nNase Mitsuki: Mitsuki at first seems like a true kuudere, but as the series develops the black haired beauty turns into a person who worries deeply for all her friends and ignores family tradition and rules for them. As the leader of the litterature club, she also comes to befriend Akihito and is a friend of his at the very start of the series.\\n\nMitsuki has a very successful big sister and an overprotective big brother and is seen as the \"cute kid\" of the family, which she has come to hate but live with.\\n\\n\nNase Hiromi: Hiromi is a real fun character who does things like touch and hold Akihito by the waist to openly admit his love for his little sister Mitsuki as he is a large siscon.\\n\nAt first glance, Hiromi seems like a light hearted comic relief character but if the situation requires, he turns from an embarassing big brother to a badass who knows exactly what he must do and as such is very dependable.\\n\nHe is a very good friend of Akihito and comes to like the pairing of Mirai and Akihito and helps them out in whatever way he can as long as it does not hurt his precious little sister.\\n\nAs the middle child of the powerful Nase family he knows a lot of the familys secrets but far from all.\\n\n__________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\nThe enjoyment of Kyoukai no Kanata was quite high in my own opinion where as simple things such as a confession from Hiromi to taking down a certain... \"smelly\" demon were very enjoyable. The main storyline was also quite intriguing and the main cast supplemented each other in such a way that it was great too watch.\\n\\n\nSadly, the ending is paramount in my opinion and Kyoukai no Kanata's ending only made questions rise and gave no explanation and quite honestly was a sorry attempt at a happy ending.\\n\n__________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\nStory: 8\\n\nArt: 10\\n\nSound: 7\\n\nCharacter: 8\\n\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\nOverall: 7",

            "content": "*//Warning// Please Do Not Read If You Can't Handle Opinions Other Than Your Own!!*\r\nToday I will be giving a short review on: Kyoukai no Kanata; Beyond the Boundary.\r\n\"A Slice-Of-Life series with a bit of Dark Fantasy mixed in between here and there\"\r\nA genre that could either be a hit or a miss, read on to see what I have to say...\r\n......\r\nStory:\r\nThe story was choppy and I lost interest in the plot about half way into the anime, by the end it did not get better. There were many questions left unanswered and reasons left unexplained of the setting/world/characters/basically EVERYTHING of this series.To make matters worsethey added filler episodes in a 13 episode anime, bad move Kyoani. Thank god the animation and music made up for the shitty story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nLike I stated before the animation (and music) made up for the piece of crap story line. It was beautiful, most of every scene was animated genius, especially the action scenes which made you think the show was spectacular! (even though it wasn't). Every frame was flawless throughout the series, even if at some points it was less than standard, you wouldn't even notice b/c you had to keep up with the horrible storyline!\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAs I stated before, the music (and animation) made up for the story and characters. The sound track for the series was spot on, each sound corresponding perfectly with each and every frame. Though sometimes the music and mood didn't fit well together (dark music with cutesy/peppy animation isn't a good combo in my opinion) the plot would sky rocket a corner and you wouldn't even care b/c you had to stick with the story. I especially thought that the opening and ending to this series was gorgeous, in both animation and music, but also gave me a false hope that the anime was going to turn out to be the next Madoka Magica (but in the end they were alike in a way, both had a plot that no one expected)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters in the series were basically cute designs filtered from other works of Kyoani jam packed with a weird one trick pony personality. The main characters weren't interesting, lacked informative back stories, and left many of us wondering if they were even important in the anime, such as the minor characters. Mirai was a sorry excuse for a protagonist, Akhito was a megane obsessed weirdo who added the worst type of romance I've seen in a slice of life feature, and who even cares about Hiroomi and Mitsuki. To put it short, *fart noise*.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI had three reasons on why I enjoyed this anime.\\n\r\n1) Animation was boss.\\n\r\n2) Music was boss.\\n\r\n3) Action was boss. (weapons were unique and different, same as the combat)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIn summary I would have to say that Kyoukai no Kanata was quite the adventure, same level of fun I would have if I was in Battle Royal. Interesting as a sack of potatoes, Characters I could identify with if my name was Mary Sue, and a story that made me question everything in the series!! Literally the only thing that kept me going through this death ride was the pretty animation and music, which makes me feel like shit b/c I'm known for watching series with good stories that interest me. Beyond the Boundary did not interest me in the slightest bit, it left no traces on me, nothing of importance, this was an overrated anime that I hope I can forget about as soon as social media stops gushing over it's \"INDIVIDUALITY AS AN ANIME\". I would not recommend anyone to watch this unless they have absolutely nothing to do, or if they want to hear/see something pretty.\\n\\n\r\nx.",

Overall it was a good piece of work, entertained from the start to the end.\r\nAnime's Overall Score: 8.53/10\r\nKyoukai's Story Score: 8/10\r\nThe story from Kyoukai seemed to be missing a few points. At one point there was a few things that seemed out of place, as well a few things that seemed to be shoved in just to ad some substance. I enjoyed a lot of the problems that arrived to the characters and how they were solved. But it seemed to be missing stuff sometimes.\r\nKyoukai's Character Score: 8/10\r\nIloved the characters designs. The designs were brilliant, the best part of the characters in my thoughts. There wasn't too much info given in backstories. And growth of some characters was just skipped or minimized. But at least the important characters got most of what was needed to feel connected with them.\\n\\n\r\nKyoukai's Enjoyment Score: 9/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series. The supernatural parts kept my attention. This anime didn't lose me from when it started, or during the series at all.\\n\\n\r\nKyoukai's Art/Animation Score: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall my favorite aspect of this anime, partly because of the character designs. But a lot of the scenes were amazingly drawn and animated. Such a beautiful anime. I didn't see any lazy ways taken or anything not appealing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nKyoukai's Sounds/OST Score: 8.5/10\\n\r\nAbove average. A few dull sounds, but at least the OP and ED are fairly good. Best part of the sounds from the series.",

Guess I just love those kawaii moe type characters.\r\nWell anyways coming to the review. I enjoyed this series very much overall. I was able to get into the series relatively fast and it never got boring in my opinion. The story itself isn't that strong, but I still think it's something quite unique and enjoyable. However, many things were left unexplained in the end and I'm disappointed how they didn't tell or show us in any kind of a way why certain characters decided to play thisrole and commit that action. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not really the type who interprets characters and judge why they're good or bad and I don't really concentrate on looking at developments so I'll skip this part. Well I guess everyone played their role into developing the plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt. Nothing much to say except that it's outstanding and phenomenal once again by KyoAni. I just love anime that have really great artworks. Besides that the music here is just simply awesome. They managed to end like every episode so perfectly with a sentence that makes you wait anxiously for the next one and the music to it fits perfectly well. First anime song I put in to my iPod ever since i started watching anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this series was fascinating and if KyoAni manages to deliver an additional season with some explanation behind things they didn't manage to do in the first one, it would be amazing. I'd put this between 7 and an 8, but since I enjoyed it a lot, I'll give it an 8.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really a matter of personal taste whether you'll enjoy this or not, but at least give it a try. You're the one judging the show after all.",

            "content": "Like most KyoAni works, Kyoukai no Kanata is an anime that watchers either love or hate. While I acknowledge its flaws that usually would send people away, I found it to be an interesting anime nonetheless.\r\nStory:\r\nKnK is one of those shows that makes an odd impression at first, which usually would mark poor writing to most. In fact, the story starts off slow and doesn't truly take off until episode 6 or 7. However, from then on, things get...complex. I will just leave it at that for now, so I can move on.\r\nArt:\r\nClassic KyoAni fare here, with some supernatural twists. I especially liked the realmsof the greater youmu, which seemed almost reminiscent of the Witch Barriers from Madoka Magica or the daydreams from Yumekui Merry. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it could have meshed a bit better, the OP transitioned in and out well enough. And the ED always faded in quite well at the end of each episode. As for the other sounds, the tone was definitely there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nOkay...I will say right now that I am a big fan of the Nase clan, especially Hiroomi. Nonetheless, that isn't to say the rest of the cast isn't as interesting to me. The protagonists, Kanbara Akihito and Kuriyama Mirai, were both very appealing and relatable characters despite being outsiders for their own reasons. Then there are the Shindou youmu pair that run the appraisal/photo studio that have their own appeals (Aya being subtle and sly seeing as she is a Kitsune Youmu, and Ai being a fricking cute kitty youmu) and the antagonist (?), Fujima Miroku...who is just weird. In any case, it seems that making appealing characters is of course KyoAni's strong suit anyways, so I am not surprised here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, I enjoyed this when I was watching it during Fall season. Although, that may be because it reminded me a little of the kind of stories I want to produce one day as a writer. Who knows, though, as I enjoyed it nonetheless.",

            "content": "Starts of as a masterpiece, has ups and downs but doesn't really hold up. Then before the final arc, gets all plot twistish in a great way, renewing my hope in it, only to go downhill from there and almost goes to offer an ending that is pretty cool, but then totally screws it up in last few minutes. I was so stunned by the ridiculousness of the ending that I thought there must have been some catch with it like with Oreimo or Toradora endings, something that requires googling if one isn't particularly perceptive. But to no avail. Even Clannad didn't pull this bigof an asspull. \\n\\n\r\nActually I don't know of a single anime to pull off this outstandingly retarded ending, well, other than Oreimo if taken literally. On the other hand, it's possible to pretended last few minutes didn't happen... and that fixes it considerably. So from now on let's pretend it ends at 22:02, for the sake of argument. Now that that's out of the way, the second biggest problem were the siscon jokes and crazy mom jokes. Those were just so extremely out of place and unnecessary. Third biggest problem would be one guy that's just evil for no reason at all. Bad writing! No! \\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of non-seriousness juggling with seriousness in weird ways, but it kinda works out, but then when crazy nonsense action gets added to the mix... managing your expectations gets a bit confusing. It might be a bit innovative in to which lengths it goes with serious-silly-crazy juggling, and sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't, and such thing depends a lot on the viewer. So how was this then actually really enjoyable to watch for the most time? Because KyoAni damnit. \\n\\n\r\nThose stupidly high budget production values are worth it on their own. This especially goes for action sequences. Though bobduh doesn't consider action sequences to be good, I do feel the need to point out how extremely gorgeous, rich, creative and detailed they are. It reminded me a bit of the way they handled action sequences in Munto, which were also gorgeous (for their time). \\n\\n\r\nAnd with every other production aspect being on this same level, it just makes it an enjoyable experience. Humor has some extremely good moments, as well as moe having some extremely heart piercing moments. Characters generally feel good, as with any KyoAni work. I loved the fast pacing of the plot. Even the pacing of SoL and silly banter was exceptionally well handled, and it did wonders for executing excellent humor timings at places. Biggest downfall is wasted potential narrative-wise. Still recommended to anyone who's a fan of KyoAni style. I even didn't mind the usual silliness of magical fantasy setting due to show being well grounded in characters.",

            "content": "So my friend recently recommended the anime to me and said that it was an amazing masterpiece. At the time I didn't have anything better to do so I ended up watching the entire thing in 2 days. After completing the anime I was left very confused as contrary to what my friend had said, I didn't find this anime very good at all. We ended up having an argument about this so I ended up creating a M.A.L. account just to review this. Hence, here is my two cents on Beyond the Boundary / Kyoukai no Katana: \r\nSTORY: 3\r\nInitially after watching the first fewepisodes, I was honestly intrigued. It had a very interesting premise (all be it not the most original) that made me feel like if nothing else would at least kill the time for me. This turned out to be completely wrong as the plot quickly turned not only predictable but very generic and full of unoriginal cliques and ex machinas. On top of this I found the anime somewhat hard to follow and not as fluid as I would like. At times i even found myself rewinding in order to see what happened. In short, despite the somewhat promising premise, the studio executed terribly on the actual story.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8 \\n\r\nUnlike the story, the art and animation is gorgeous. That's really all i have to say.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nMusic wise, it stays pretty consistent. I personally enjoyed the music. Sound wise, I didn't notice enough to actually have any input on it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4\\n\r\nI found most characters underdeveloped or that i simply didn't care about them. Alot of the time i felt like characters would act in ways they normally wouldn't in order to just progress the plot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nIn the beginning i honestly was excited to watch more but as the plot progressed the lack of character development and the inconsistent pacing kinda broke my suspense and disbelief. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nOverall I did somewhat enjoy myself in the beginning however the lack of character development, inconsistent pacing, use of cliques and ex machinas, and confusing cuts made the anime hard to watch twords the end.",

            "content": "This is the most visually stunning anime I have ever seen! Akihito is a half youmu, half human that is being chased by the Spirit World warrior Mirai. Though he is immortal as he is a youmu (strange creatures roaming the planet that may be hostile/aren\u2019t visible to humans), that doesn\u2019t stop Mirai from plunging a sword into his body multiple times, in the hopes of gaining practice to fight the actually hostile full Youmu. Through this weird dynamic, a friendship forms between the two, as they learn that they are both more similar than they had previously thought.\r\nThe world in Beyond the Boundary iswell developed and is introduced to the viewer as it is introduced to Mirai, who has moved into Akihito\u2019s town. She learns of the Youmu family that is friendly and trades Youmu stones (stones that are collected after Youmu are defeated) with money to sustain the Spirit World Warriors. The Spirit World Warrior families of two friends Hiroomi and Mitsuki are also introduced as those watching Mirai and Akihito and their actions, should they ever need to intervene for the safety of mankind. Everything is not what it seems when it comes to this anime. Though the first episodes introduce the characters and some of their backstory, as the episodes progress, you realise why some characters acted in a particular way in the previous episode. Each episode peels back a different layer of the characters\u2019 personalities, whilst also contributing to the plot. Mirai\u2019s backstory and her desire to escape the hostility of the family that had taken her in after the death of her own family is a very interesting aspect of the start of the anime. Akihito\u2019s backstory is less well developed as there are so many questions left unanswered at the end of the anime regarding his powers and how he had acquired them. The progression of the plot and the whole secret behind \u2018Beyond the Boundary\u2019 and what this phrase means was my favourite aspect of this anime as it was such a climactic, albeit confusing ending, which I shall get to later. \\n\\n\r\nSo there is obviously romance between Mirai and Akihito, but it is a develops at a very slow pace, which is fitting. Though it\u2019s not blatantly confessed between the leads until later in the anime, it is expertly weaved with the plot. Mirai relates with Akihito, as she is not popular in the Spirit Warrior world due to her special ability of fighting the Youmu with a sword made out of her blood which makes her incredibly powerful. Akihito doesn\u2019t really fit in with the humans of the world, or the Youmu and later in the anime, we learn that his friends are only around him because of an ulterior motive. The fact that Mirai and Akihito are both super powerful in their own way is a great aspect of their relationship, as they can subdue the destructive nature in each other. Out of this desire to help each other control their powers and sacrifice themselves for each other, a completely believable and awesome romance flourishes. The suspenseful back-and-forth nature of their relationship towards the end is heart stopping, slightly irritating, yet mostly satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime really reminded me about why I love the world of anime in the first place. Really serious stuff can be going on, yet somehow, adding hilarious jokes such as a FULL EPISODE where all the characters band together to sing a song and a dance routine in pop star outfits, in the hopes of subduing a particularly strange Youmu still works somehow! This show can just change the tone from dark to comical at the flip of a switch. The teasing of Akihito\u2019s glasses obsession and Akihito and Hiroomi\u2019s bromance never gets old. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters do not feel like side characters at all! We have the adorable Youmu, Ai. The Nase spirit warriors Hiroomi and Mitsuki that really become almost best friends with Akihito and Mirai. The bloodthirsty mysterious character Sakura, who is integral to the mysteries of the plot. We also have the unique Youmu, which completely alter the appearance of the world when they arrive to the town, creating a visually immersive experience, especially during the battle scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was the least satisfying because there were so many questions left unanswered! Though I can\u2019t mention them for the sake of no spoilers, Akihito\u2019s backstory felt extremely unresolved, as well as, certain things he manages to do at the end of the anime are never explained. Other mysteries of the Nase family and the Spirit Warrior Society are also left ambiguous.\\n\\n\r\nThe battle scenes are ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR and are paired with the most immersive heart stirring music. The atmosphere is just so magical and manages to achieve a level that I have not seen many other anime in the past even come close to. I am just in awe when thinking about the music and visual imagery of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nWatch this anime. Your ears and your eyes will thank you for it! You may get an unexpected laugh too, amidst the dark nature of the remainder of Beyond the Boundary.\\n",

I've been dying to see an actual good anime for a long time and some reviews are totally misleading. If you are trying to find a good show to watch and its been awhile since you have seen a  genuinely well made anime, then I would highly recommend this. There should be no reason to not watch this show and should give it a try. If you do not like it then thatswhat you got, but I can say now that you should for sure give this show a try because it is worth it. Just please try it. Like really the worst you have to lose is the only thing you can get back, right? Time. But if your going to waste your time on a show, waste it on this one. Sorry I don't think I went bible sized but maybe a nice sized novel!",

I think the use of symbolism to convey this message really ties the events of the world and the conflict within each character together beautifully to add emphasis to both the world and the development of each character. \\n\\n\r\nThough, while it has very unique characters and a well developed main cast, the story is all over the place. The introduction of the climactic villain comes very late into the Anime and it loses it's focus around the middle of the season. \\n\\n\r\nSo, should you watch \"Beyond the Boundary\"?\\n\r\nIf you don't mind sitting through an unorthodox story arc or value polished characters over a polished plot, then I would recommend checking it out. If you do really like your plot polished, I would recommend giving it 5-6 episodes before deciding for yourself.",

            "content": "Story: 9\r\nThe story in general is great, it's really nice and you can feel some romantic element in there. The only part that makes me feel a little bit unsatisfied is the last part of the last episode, which they don't really explain the reason as to why that happens. However, it is not going to stop me from not loving this story.\r\nArt: 10 (I wish there was something even higher than 10)\r\nKyoukai no Kanata's visual can be simply put in 3 words: \"Beyond the Boundary\" (Yes, the English translation of the title of the anime), what I want to imply is that the artworkare just magnificent, it's beyond the boundary that holds back the quality of the animation of so many other anime series. In other words, from the perspective of an artist myself, I'd just say it's beyond gorgeous for a 2013 anime series, even at the time of this review was being made (2016), there are a lot of anime series whose artworks are nowhere near the level of Kyoukai Kanata. Splendid job Kyouto Animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe musics and sound effects in general are great. I especially love \"Yakusoku no Kizuna\", a song inserted in the episode 6 of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThe main characters are Akihito and Kuriyama.\\n\r\nKuriyama is truly deserved the title that Akihito gives her, she's \"Megane no Bishoujo\" (Bespectacled Beauty). She is simply so superb, so adorable. She even has a catchphrase, which is \"Fuyukai desu\", which is extremely cute and memorable to me for some unknown reasons. Also, throughout the series, you can see her development as the result of interacting with Akihito. \\n\r\nSpeaking of Akihito, I don't know if it's because he's literally immortal or not but he doesn't fight at all (He only fights a bit in the last episode), which is a little bit disappointed. Also, I can't help but feel like his role is nothing but being a shadow, being a factor that helps stand out Kuriyama Mirai. To put simply, I feel like there aren't really anything going on with him.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are good, each of them has their role and is also an important part of the story (except for the teacher)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI totally felt superb as I was watching this anime, just as simple as that.\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap this up, total score: 48 + 2 points from my love for Kuriyama-san = 50/50. It's simply a masterpiece to me. I'd recommend this anime to anyone who wants to have a good show to enjoy. You don't have to necessarily love it like I do but it's definitely worth watching.",

            "content": "Kyoukai no Kanata is a Fantasy anime about (you guessed it) exterminating demons. Our clumsy heroine is named Kuriyama Mirai, whose path crossed with Kanbara Akihitsu, a half-human, haf-demon hybrid incapable of dying. \r\nStory (5/10 - Not Good, Not Embarrassingly Bad)\r\n-Fantasy anime often delves into supernatural and feasts on the many superstitions of Japanese culture. In this case, the existence of demons has been twisted in a way where there is no good spirit, or gods, but rather Exterminators.\r\n-Bonus episode is complete fanservice, because as soon as you start to wish Kanbara Akihitsu wasn't brooding so much, fall in love with Nase Mistuki's eyes, voice,hair, body - everything, genuinely find Nase Hiroomi's eccentricity entertaining, and are tired of only imagining Kuriyama Mirai sexy-posing that you're quite sure you have developed a glasses-complex yourself, they hit you with an overdramatic gem of an episode that should really piss you off because it's total nonsense but you just can't seem to hate it. And then you think \"Wait a minute. I thought this was a dark fantasy anime?\"\\n\r\n-I'm a sucker for endings where things go right. The story behind this felt shallow, leaving important questions behind about various aspects of the characters. The Nase Elder? The Exterminator's Society? Inami Sakura's journey? The little-sister complex? Mitsuki's filler character? The story just fell flat if you think about it.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10 - KyoAni AF)\\n\r\n     -I love Kyoto Animation's attention to detail. I love their consistency. I love their directing. I love their fluid motion. I love their comical degredation of animation as comedy. I love KyoAni. I will never complain of KyoAni. If I was Japanese, I would love to work with KyoAni.\\n\r\n     -With that being said, I know just how well KyoAni can perform, and this was not their best. A plot twist at one of the later episodes seemed inconsistent with the episodes prior, and it came basically out of nowhere. I know KyoAni can do way better than this (they proved it and did better with H!E) because it's a studio that prides itself with detail. On the other hand, they had tried to save it with sparkling light shows and heavy but beautifully fluid action animation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10 - Could Be Better, Slightly Lacking)\\n\r\n  Opening Theme (6/10)\\n\r\n     -I can't really say KyoAni studios is famous for their soundtracks, but they're not bad. However, using a slow song as an opening theme (when it is in fact, should not be a slow anime) kind of sits off-balance with me.\\n\r\n     -The ending note of the OP, followed by an action sound effect in the story, is not a good kind of 180 degree turn.\\n\r\n  Ending Theme (8/10)\\n\r\n     -Going along with the theme of its OP, this anime's closing note, in comparison, reverberates. I am not a fan of heavy endings (who needs them?) and I think this sound goes perfect with the anime's slightly-melodramatic-set-in-high-school plot, if that was the point. But it's not. It's supposed to be Dark Fantasy. Like the song, but it's too lighthearted for an anime trying to be dark.\\n\r\n  Soundtrack (5/10)\\n\r\n     -I barely noticed it, if there was. I'm disappointed enough to say that there was no such thing as a scary note in the whole anime. Sound sets the mood, and when the story was trying to be dark while the soundtrack was essentially pop - it's all over the place.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10 - Could Be Better)\\n\r\n     -I honestly can't give an accurate rating on its various characters as a whole, because it would be hell to try and average it out. So I'd rather point out the characters who stood out, whether they be bad or good.\\n\r\n  Kuriyama Mirai (Main)\\n\r\n     -Our usual clumsy but passionate, mysteriously scarred heroine. She starts off well with the trope, and grows out of it in the end. Totally overpowered, but that's how we get off on such types of anime. This story was about her atonement, loss-of-self, and eventual redemption. Kyoukai no Kanata is not a story of Mirai coming of age and improving her skill, which is a shame, because I would have loved more blood work.\\n\r\n  Kanbara Akihitsu (Main)\\n\r\n     -Our regular used-to-be-passive-but-that-all-changed-when-the-fire-nation-attacked protagonist. At least, that's how he introduced himself as. There's not much detail looked into that statement, because none of his actions show any passiveness at all. In fact, he's a downright meddler. It moves the story along, but then what was the point in introducing him as otherwise?\\n\r\n  Nase Hiromi\\n\r\n     -Hiromi is the only main character that we do not meet in the pilot episode, and they present him as this mysterious older student who knows things you don't (at least during the first part of episode 2). Then we see his eccentric, sister-complex side, and I freakin' loved it. Just like a good, wise, comic-relief character, he fits the part. He grows, too, but we never really understand just what exactly he truly holds dear and keeps him living. Besides Mitsuki, of course.\\n\r\n  Nase Mitsuki\\n\r\n     -She was introduced in the first episode as our go-to girl who knows what there is to know, but eventually falls completely flat in the last episode. Don't get me wrong, I love Mitsuki. I love her ridiculous voice when she says \"onii-chan\" and dear god, \"oneesama.\" However, my love for her Kousaka Reina and Nakaseko Kaori lovechild character design can't save her from her cruel fate as a tossed-aside trope character. We have an episode of her during the light festival and to be honest, that was just really confusing and felt like fanservice of our characters wearing kimonos/yukatas rather than a plot device to seemingly move Mitsuki's character forward while showing hints of her past. A real shame.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10 - Had To Binge It)\\n\r\n-To be honest, I love anime that doesn't take itself too seriously. I devour that stuff for breakfast - or in this case, as a midnight snack. I don't need a story to be heavy in order to enjoy it. I had fun with this anime and finished it in one sitting, which is saying it's not boring at all.\\n\\n\r\nNothing unusual, a few things worth noting, all in all not that bad of an anime. Anyone can watch it and have a good time if you're not in the mood to be bombarded with some heavy-duty plot that you can't have fun.",

            "content": "Kyoukai no Kanata is a prime example of a big budget anime that fails to deliver all the possible potential it has to be a good show. But don't let this opening comment fool you. Read on and find out if the show really does fail!\r\nThe story was a fairly decent one but at times it didn't know what it wanted to be or what direction to go in, switching genres and putting them into scenes that wouldn't necessarily mix well together. Then adding different story layers to an already jumpy one makes the story aspect of the show harder to enjoy and overall makingit an anime that you might want to drop, but don't let the flaws of the story stop you from watching because the story is not bad, it just doesn't know what be and when to be it at the right time. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters I feel are what saves the show from its somewhat flawed story. There are a flurry of main and side characters that you will come to love and enjoy watching through this 12 episode anime. One thing I think this show does well is giving the characters time to develop by sometimes dedicating and episode to the development of one or two characters as well as the relationship between 2 or more characters. It adds something to the story to make it worth watching to see how these characters interact and make it through tough situations they are in. Akihito Kanbara is a great main character as you see him develop and cope with the conflicts that happen throughout the story along with Mirai Kuriyama who develops alongside Kanbara. Even side characters are enjoyable although not getting as much development(obviously). \\n\\n\r\nThe art is something that doesn't even need to be mentioned because as I stated before this is an anime that you can clearly tell has a big budget, and whats a better way to show that to the viewer than to flaunt amazing, and fluid animation to the viewer in each episode. Along side those Moe moments that tend to make you go \"awwww\" inside your head. The art I can say is pretty damn good.\\n\\n\r\nThe music itself is not something that you will be remembering a week after you complete this show and it might be something that might not have even stuck out to you, but that's just how I personally felt. Other than the very catchy opening song the music is just there to add to the mood of the show and won't be very memorable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall you shouldn't let the flaws of the story keep you from watching this big budget, well animated show that has a flurry of fun, enjoyable, and well developed characters. Although there is nothing too great about the story or music, the pure enjoyment I got from the characters and art makes this well worth watching through even if it is only once. \\n\\n\r\nKyoukai no Kanata gets a 8/10",

            "content": "I really think that animes with 11-12-13 episodes don't work out, because, when you are getting closer to the characters, starting knowing them better, truly starting to enjoy the story and the plot... It ends...\r\n*spoilers*\r\nKyoukai no Kanata is another of this \"suit\". The development of the characters started very well, knowing their tastes, story, characteristics that made them \"special\" different and unique. And it just ends. And I hate that. \r\nLet's take Kuriyama Mirai for instinct... She dissapeared, I thought she died, but it doesn't matter, cuz I felt almost nothing watching she vanishing and Akhito crying and screaming... Again it made me feel almostnothing. To show, how bad this is, I think Mitsuki is a stronger character than Mirai, a secondary character was more outstanding than the main character.\\n\r\nTalking about Mitsuki, the anime really wasted some well written background, secondary characters. Shuzuku, Ai, Ayaka, Sakura, etc... One is a badass veteran warrior teacher. We barely saw her in action, or heard about her. Ai and Ayaka are both Youmus that have so much to show and tell, especially Ayaka... And Akihito's mother Yayoi, that woman is unpredictable, and seems to know A LOT about the Youmus, spiritual warriors and events. But we only could take a good look at her, on her ridiculous costumes, and a demo of her abilities of combat, and showing that she's not a complete air-head... \\n\r\nI say again, animes with 12 episodes doesn't work out. Of course, that THERE IS animes with 12-13 episodes that give their show, Acchi Kocchi, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, etc. But Kyoukai no Kanata had SO MUCH potential that went to waste, the characters, the world that is created, the clans/families, the spiritual warriors, the oak shadow, the Kyoukai no Kanata... Everything literally RAMMED in our heads with no right to questions.\\n\r\nEven through, the show really is enjoyable, it have its funny, action moments, and a lot to tell, so if you are looking on a anime to watch. Go-on ahead and watch it, you will not regret.",

            "content": "It is a decent anime. Actually, it is better than decent. It is a really good anime. There are many things that go into an anime\u2019s quality, namely animation quality, story-telling, characters, plot and etc.\r\n It\u2019s not difficult to notice that the animation quality in this anime is superb. From big action sequences to subtle changes in facial expressions, this anime has gorgeous visuals down pat. The character designs fit their tropes, but are still pleasing and almost refreshing despite being in most high-school-set animes. If you like eye-candy this anime has it.\r\nMost of the characters are likeable and interesting. When they are in dangeryou actually feel something for them despite their plot armor. The interactions between all of the main characters (Akihito, Kuriyama, Hiromi, and Mitsuki) all feel natural. There is time spent on not only developing these characters but also their relationships. Nothing feels forced between these four. It is enjoyable to watch humor, drama, and even budding romance develop among them. \\n\r\nHowever, while the main cast is well executed\u2026 some of the side characters do feel forced or just not fleshed out enough. Miroku for example, they never fully explain his motives. The writers just have him be evil for evil\u2019s sake. And when all the other characters seem so believable it is difficult to not roll your eyes at the typical cartoonish anime portrayal of him pushing his glasses up his face sinisterly. Izumi\u2019s character also feels a bit rushed along with Sakura\u2019s. But in all honesty, this can be chalked up to the fact the story is based on a light novel and the anime is only 12 episodes. The writers could\u2019ve spread time and effort a little more evenly, but they chose to really focus on the relationships with the main four and that dedication shows where it counts.\\n\r\nThe plot and storytelling are different. I don\u2019t mean that you\u2019ve never seen this plot before, but that the story is driven on the development between the two main characters (and the main supporting characters) is what really sells it. There isn\u2019t just action and the characters happen to be pasted there like it feels with so many anime. The plot itself has some real appeal and a little bit of mystery, but unfortunately it isn\u2019t handled as well as it could\u2019ve been. There are some real legitimate plot holes that depending on your tolerance level could kind of spoil the anime for you. I\u2019m mostly thinking of the ending, but I was so happy that I didn\u2019t care. The shows poses a lot of questions that seem like they might be answered, but never are. \\n\r\nThat is my only real grievance other than the lack of development with the background cast. Well I have one other grievance; the show is a little fan-servicey. (I\u2019m a straight female) There is some unnecessary Moe-blobness that is strictly there for that particular demographic of fans who watch for the cute and not for the character. Fortunately, these scenes are kept relatively tasteful and aren\u2019t that much of a distraction. Oh except episode six. You can completely skip episode six. It\u2019s filler.\\n\r\nOverall Kyokai no Kanata is a really good anime. It is not the best anime I\u2019ve ever seen, but it is far better in terms of production and character than many anime to come out recently. It\u2019s a breath of fresh air and if you\u2019re not a stuck up prick you\u2019ll really enjoy it. \\n",

            "content": "Plot and Story Line\r\nKyoukai no Kanata is a Fantasy, Slice of Life and Supernatural anime that aired in 2013. With a total of 12 episodes the producers Lantis, Pony Canyon and TBS did a...good job. I can't say it is bad, but to be honest I did expect more. The idea itself is pretty good but the way the makers brought the story over was just okay. The happenings in the story are forced and the story line alone is, in my opinion, rushed. But let's try to get to the bottom of it, shall we?\r\nSo, the story of Beyond the Boundary takes place ina Universe where the Earth is beside humans, inhibited by demon-like creatures called Youmu and people with special abilities named Spirit Hunters who fight them. One of those Spirit Hunters is Mirai Kuriyama. Her special power is to manipulate blood and turn it into a weapon which she uses to fight the evil youmu. Because of her ability she lives an isolated life, until she meets Akihito, who happens to be an immortal half-youmu. Soon, they realize that their life paths are going into the same direction but that leaves one open question. Will they be able to walk it together?\\n\r\nThe story line of Beyond the Boundary is unfortunately undeveloped, leaving a couple of illogical and not well-explained points right from the beginning.  It as really hard to catch up with all the youmu and spirit world stuff because you never get a single good explanation. New characters are introduced, new side-story lines and background stories appear but you can't connect them all into one single story. You do get the point but you never get to the real core of it. I could enjoy it, but very hard, because it leaves so many unanswered questions behind. \\n\r\nThe plot alone, or let's say \"what the anime is about\" is good. A good action, fantasy anime is mostly enjoyable but not if it has this many plot holes. You get the feeling that you skipped something important but you did not, it was left out by the anime alone. \\n\r\nThe anime introduces the dark spirit world but not in a good way. You just don't get the feeling that it really is a dark and dangerous place. That's probably because they wanted to balance the supernatural with the slice of life characteristic of the anime. But when it comes to the action in the anime, I was not disappointed. The action scenes were fantastic and the only bad thing about them was that they were short. All the fights end very quickly. In the moment you really get into the fight it ends. Still, the action of Kyoukai no Kanata is definitely the best part of the anime. \\n\r\nOne point where the anime started well are the background stories. They were quite intriguing and they awakened an interest in me, but...Yes there is a but. They did not get to the core. I was really sad about the unfinished, or better said, not completely told, story of Nase Izumi. They reveal her \"dark secret of the past\" in the very ending where you don't even get the chance to get involved. I have to admit I wad caught by her character right in the beginning of the show. \\n\r\nIn the Genre section of this anime, My Anime List leaves out one important genre I would add Beyond the Boundary to; ROMANCE. I have the stron feeling that this anime was always meant to be a cute love story. I din't mind that, it was nice. The best part about it is that the romance in the anime is probably the only well presented and finished segment of the whole show. It's the typical cute high school love, that you can't hate.  \\n\r\nOn the whole: Nicely imagined, done wrong. Kyoukai no Kanata had the potential to be a great anime with a good story and a very intriguing background but ended up as being \"only good\" because of various reasons that can turn an anime into a \"good for killing boredom\" show. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nWell, despite having some issues in the story itself, this anime got from me some bad points for the characters too. The only character that sticks out with her personality is Kuriyama, but she also gets annoying from time to time. The characters lack in originality and they can be easily related to some random characters from other anime. I wouldn't mind writing about the other main Kanabara Akihito, but there is no need. Here for you, I have some more information about the only character that is worth talking about from this anime.\\n\r\nMirai Kuriyama is a first-year high school student that rarely stands out. Due to her ability to control blood and turn it into any weapon she wants she is considered dangerous. That's why she is an introvert and shy person. Two more words describe her personality, aloof and clumsy. In the beginning of the story she is afraid of fighting youmu, making it hard for her to earn money, considering the fact that it's actually her profession. Also a fact about Kuriyama, she loves Bonsai trees and regularly writes about them on her blog. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Style\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this anime is awesome. It's actually the thing that kinda saves the anime from a near catastrophe. The colors are awesome and bright, contrast is great, the movements are smooth and the backgrounds are just beautiful. I always see if an animation is good or not in some fast, action scenes. This anime had many, and I have to say that they were awesome. The animation of Kyoukai no Kanata is really good and probably it's best side. When it comes to the style, it's okay. Even tough their personalities seemed pretty dull, I loved the looks of the characters. They were kinda special and not so mainstream. Style is acceptable in my opinion. Thumbs up for Animation and Style.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nTo conclude this anime review, Kyoukai no Kanata or Beyond the Boundary really lies on the boundary of a good anime. The story is more or less familiar from other anime and not that special but it still has it's own appeal and details that saved it. The characters could have become better with a little more effort but they are acceptable. Animation and Style are awesome. This anime has only 12 episodes so it is awesome for a lazy and rainy Saturday like this today. It is not one of the best, but it's worth your time.\\n\\n\r\n-Your Anime Girl <3 \\n\r\nFor more reviews visit: worldofanimegirl.blogspot.com\\n",

I feel as though it is unappreciated because of the fact that it is light material. The depth that could have, maybe even should have, gone into it is secondary to the enjoyment of watching the show itself. I found my self looking for shows that aren't just good in terms of plot and all but make me happy. And I truly enjoyed this show to death. I hope that they make more seasons of it. Also please note that the movie for this show is beautiful aswell.",

            "content": "*This review contains no spoilers*\r\nThis anime... What can I say? This anime was simply one of the best of all time, in both action and romance. It is definitely one of my favorite anime, up with the best of its genres. With its brilliant art, stunning visuals, and appealing story, this short 12-episode series will be sure to make you want more. Trust me, I am no spokesperson for this anime, but this is one of the finest anime of all time. Its unique story may push some away from this anime, but for anyone who has read te plot synopsis and is intrigued, thisis definitely a great anime with watching.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime's story is unique. Assuming you read the plot, you can tell this is a unique story that may seem unappealing. This anime pulls off this story amazingly well. The story keeps you intrigued and at the edge of your seat the whole time. It is a well-balanced mix of romance and action, and while there is one filler episode, it uses the episode to connect with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see from the internet or the poster for this anime, the art is stunning. It is some of the most visually appealing art in the whole anime library.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that kept me in this anime is the soundtrack. I believe that the soundtrack is what can make or break an anime, since it is what an anime needs to be immersive. Well, I give this anime props, because this is some of the best music I've ever heard from an anime. The Opening and Ending are both musics I would listen to for an entire day, and the sad music and the action music keep me immersed throughout the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis story plays around with different character roles throughout teh anime, and I have to say, it worked very well. The characters are each unique and none of the important characters are static, especially if you watch this in tandem with the second Kyoukai no Kanata movie, which is a continuation of this anime, and really adds to the story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best aspects of this anime is the enjoyment. This anime is one where every time a character smiles, you smile too, and during the sad parts, you feel a deep sadness within you. This is one of those anime that can get you connected to the story and the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this anime if you have any interest in it from reading the plot. Thanks for your time!",

            "content": "In contrary to the other reviews I'll make this one rather short and don't forget, it's my own opinion.\r\nSo why should you watch Kyoukai no Kanata?\r\nThe story isn't something really knew or unique and probalby can be forseen many times. People even complain, that it doesn't know what it wants to be, because there are times we have a comedy show, we have deep psychological themes, we have a romance and we have a completly unrelated filler-episode (wich I simply loved!).\r\nBut in my opinion that's KnK strong point. I truly laughed, I was excited, I sufferd with the characters, I thought about some serious themes,I cried and I loved every minute of it. Personally I was glad I waited until all episodes were released, because I probably couldn't have wait a week every time.\\n\r\nYeah, there are some plottholes and the story doesn't really explain the world or anything, but that's okay, the characters don't know everything themeself, that's just how life is.\\n\r\nAlso the characters aren't extraordinary or outstanding, but they're kinda living and it's easy to imagine how they lived.\\n\r\nTo round everything up, the art is magnificent and the OST is great and fits the atmosphere in every moment.\\n\\n\r\nSo give it a try and don't think to much about plotholes or worldbuilding, just let yourself be emarged in a beautiful scenary with really loveable charaters and an emotional story.",
