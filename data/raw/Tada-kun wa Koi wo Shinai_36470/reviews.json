            "content": "There's always that one show you find that starts off excellently and you expect it to go to greater lengths and remain consistent if not become better but then that does not happen every time, partly because a show doesn't bring any originality with it and partly because it doesn't strive to make things even a little unpredictable, that is the case with Tada-kun Never Falls in Love.\r\nRight around the first and second episodes I felt it was amazing since it started off so well, showing a bright artstyle not unlike Doga Kobo\u2019s other more popular (and obviously better) anime, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. The charactersfelt cheerful and the whole anime gave you a cheerful vibe, now this vibe was obviously continued in the rest of the anime but the differing point is that it was cliched to the extreme. Don't get me wrong, cliches aren't bad, but they have to be handled properly to make the show watchable and not lazily copy over cliches and skin them with your colour and post it as your anime, this is unfortunately what Tada-kun continued to do and it certainly was heartbreaking for me to see that the show I loved in episode one became a cliche machine by the 5th episode (and I'm talking about myself here, others may have started seeing effects way earlier than me). \\n\\n\r\nBeing a Slice of Life meant that a concrete plot wasn't exactly on the list of priorities for any anime studio for that matter, so it comes by no surprise that this show as well didn't have one, and since this is very normal and common with most Slice of Life shows in general, I'll make this the one step I'll forgive. But what comes is the rest. One problem only, cliches. Each episode was filled to the brim with cliches, be it a situation, a backstory (not Tada\u2019s), the characters, and unfortunately, the romance. \\n\\n\r\nA cliched romance isn't exactly something I'll throw over to the Lions for, but when it's not even trying to add a dash of originality things start to get messy. I mostly went \u201cOh so in the next episode preview this is going to happen? Then this cliche will be followed\u201d and it killed my enjoyment in the anime as compared to the first episode. And this isn't a hot springs episode thing, sudden bumps, blushes at the same words, a situation being ruined by the characters\u2019 actions, are all examples of cliches that the show followed (forgive me for being vague, as of the time of writing I've been watching a lot of anime this season so my memory is slightly hazy). \u201cWhy is this guy focusing so much on the cliches?\u201d you might be asking. To me, cliches were the one biggest problem the show had, if this was fixed, I doubt the show would disappoint me, but then again, improving cliches is very much easier said than done. And fixing them is important because to keep a Slice of Life fun, especially a romance, you need fresh ideas, Tada had none of that.\\n\\n\r\nTada-kun\u2019s characters weren't the most unique of ones but I'll have to give credit, they were cheerful but their personalities were once again riddled by the C word (pretty sure you're as tired of reading it as I am writing it, but then again, this was the biggest problem of the show anyway). Although fans were gleefully picking out the ships right from the first episode going \u201cAlec x Ijuuin\u201d and the like it kinda felt a bit boring. I mean, not trying to act nitpicky but a little bit of a surprise is always welcome in a romance isn't it? \u201cNo\u201d according to this anime. Although not having a surprise isn't 100% bad per se but yet again, Tada-kun didn't try to make it work. At best this can remind me that the show felt lazy. Doga Kobo tried to make something fun but a little different but didn't want to make the effort for it and got itself trapped within its own plans. Apart from the cat, every single romance in the show was horribly implemented. Tada X Teresa has got to be one of the most irritating romances I've ever seen because both of them acted so stupidly and their shyness for normal things like talking to each other (especially when they first met) has got to be a pathetic way to go about the \u201cfalling in love\u201d step of romances. I mean, I despise the \u201clove at first sight\u201d view and Tada didn't help make it better at all. Pin-head and Representative-san\u2019s romance as well wasn't explored and was left shallow. But then again it in itself was shallow from the start. Him not knowing that his childhood friend is the idol he idolises so much? Could you be any more cliche? Before you answer that, Tada already did. Yamashita Dog and Tada\u2019s sister as well were just a one blush game as well. Coming back to Tada, his \u201cromance\u201d with Teresa was random, pretty much non-existent except for the last 3 episodes maybe if you don't count stupid \u201cOh I saw you look at me and I don't know what to say\u201d crap as \u201clove\u201d... I'm not saying shy romances are bad, but Tada and Teresa made them look pathetic with their random shyness. Sometimes they're super shy and the other second they're pretty much flirting?\\n\\n\r\nPeople went memeing around saying that the cats had the best romance but funnily enough that turned out to be very much true, until *that* happened. On the other hand the other romances felt average and not out of the box. At many times I found myself predicting what the next situation could be for the characters and when and how the blushes would happen. Perhaps the one romance I could like was of Ijuuin and our secretary Tsundere, Alec (since it is of a cliche I could say I don't have a problem with). The rest meanwhile, were\u2026 average like I said. It seemed as if the writers wanted to do something different, they wanted to try to make the show enjoyable in episode one, but the sad contrast in the later episode showed that they were the teenager who after getting bad grades thinks \u201cI'm going to work hard from tomorrow onwards\u201d and right the next day get caught in their usual routine, without any thought or apology for not doing what they promised themselves they'd do.\\n\\n\r\nNow, this show isn't filth, far from it, it's not FranXX, but it's average, it's mediocre. Why? It doesn't ruin everything and burn everything to the ground. It is still an anime you could watch in small increments (perhaps once a week to you binge watchers who are going to watch the show after it airs). It's still an anime that can leave most with a normal face, since it's charm is still present, only drastically reduced from what it could have been, perhaps a mere shadow of itself. Is Tada-kun the show I like to call \u201cwasted potential\u201d? Definitely. Although it didn't go it's own way it didn't veer off into the abyss either, therefore putting it in the middle. What wasn't in the middle would be the artstyle, which I've iterated thrice here was cheerful, bright and very much like Doga Kobo. Apart from reminding me about Gekkan Shoujo, it made it's characters look cute and attractive. Be it Hinako, Teresa or Tada-kun himself, everyone looked cute, and that's not to say about the colourful backgrounds and eye-catching scenery either, those were fabulous and my favourite part about the anime. But then again, cute characters and a great artstyle don't make for a good romance.\\n\\n\r\nNow something that was almost decent was the voice acting. Although it felt bad in terms of the female voice actors the male actors made up for it. I can forgive the female voice acting only on the grounds that Alec and Teresa\u2019s voice actors aren't as experienced in the field as the males were (but I must admit, Teresa\u2019s high pitched voice was VERY IRRITATING) and to be honest, apart from these two, on the male side I found Ijuuin a bit irritating with his voice, I was absolutely shocked to discover that Miyano Mamoru voiced him as a result. But in the end it boils down to how much you enjoyed the show. I for one don't hate the show (NANI), it's just that I felt let down because again, I wanted the show to continue the direction it had in episode one, if it did, it would be an 8 today or maybe even a 9. But not everything goes your way. \\n\\n\r\nThere's always that one show that clearly shows the idea the writers had in mind in the beginning but lazy writing can turn the best of starts into an average okay-ish show AT BEST, and it's sad to say but, Tada-kun stays as an example of that. I do hope that we see some improvement in Doga Kobo\u2019s next show, but as of now, I doubt a sequel to this show could carve out something better like Nozaki-kun, although I'd love to be proven wrong. Amaze me Doga Kobo.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nAnimation: 7\\n\r\nSound: 5.5\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.1",

            "content": "'Tada-kun Never Falls in Love' is a series I started watching just to know if this is actually true. Turns out the series stays loyal to its name for approximately 56 seconds. Simply amazing.\r\nThe idea is rather fresh for a romance series. Our main characters are a Japanese boy and an European exchange student who is currently living in Japan. One has to wonder how on earth on this day and age has this not been done before. Pretty much everyone knows at least 10 people IRL who have studied abroad via exchange studen programs. After getting a general idea of the premise, I wassure I would like this series. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to our main characters, Tada is bit from the generic school boy side, but appears mature and highly certain about himself in the self-centered lone wolf type of way. His whole existence appears almost businesslike. Teresa on the other hand is very open and genuine person who has the tendency of seeing beauty in pretty much everything. A bit of 2pure4this world is radiating from her during scenes where she, for example, happily plays with a cat in the rain. I also get a heart-attack whenever there is a close-up of her emerald eyes shown on screen. These two people appear to be more similar than they personality-wise seem. Pretty cool. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, that's pretty much where the good things end. My biggest problem with this series are the side-characters who do not have in anyway believable personalities. Most of them come off as purely comedic devices rather than actual characters. It's pretty annoying and unnecessary. I am not sure if I prefer this over generic drama and love-triangles or not. That's how bad it is. The voice acting for these characters is so inferior compared to the main voice acting that is immersion-breaking and reminds me that I am indeed watching an anime. And now it is not even a romance anime anymore: It's a slice of life comedy, and most of the time not even very funny. Excluding the cats who are real MVP's. Overall, this would have been So. Much. Better. as a serious series. After the quite original and interesting settings, rest of the series is filled with generic content, typical cliches and cop-out writing. I am not very impressed..",

            "content": "Sometimes I find joy in the simplest of things.\r\nTada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai is definitely one of those. At first glance unoriginal, generic romantic comedy with nothing memorable about it. However, idea and execution are two different terms. And, in case of Tada-kun, it counts twice as much.\r\nI can imagine that looking at Tada-kun's anime page doesn't strike interest in many people, and respectably so. Nothing about its story, characters or even stylization seem particulalry original. And that feeling doesn't change even at the end of the show, especially story-wise.\r\nThe story is what you would possibly expect a rom/com to be. A random meeting thatstarts off everything, transfer students, school club, trips, little sister, side-kick comedy friend, weird drama, multiple couples, cat. Tada-kun's story is really full of clich\u00e9s, overused plot elements and weird dramatic moments. However, although it has a lot of flaws, it's also needful to say that everything works kinda well together. In other words, even if I have to criticize Tada-kun's story for its genericity, It's not true that it is necessarily a bad story by itself, at least at the beginning. Events, characters are part of, collaborate with each other. Plot-continuity is also done better than in most rom/coms and the order in which certain events happen doesn't feel randomly put together but follows up development of character relations. However, what I have to say that while the story tries to become more serious as the time goes on, everything worked better when it was more light-themed, hence the first half of the show remains the best one, and things fall off a bit after that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters themselves are an area in which Tada-kun surprised me the most. Especially when it comes to the main couple. Tada, our main hero, is one of the better romance characters I've had the pleasure of seeing. That is not to say that he's special, super-complex or incredibly interesting to watch. No, what makes him so good is because he's realistic and believable. Frankly, there has probably never been a main character I could so strongly relate to. He is not laughing very much and doesn't look the happiest, yet he is not doing because he just \"wants to look cool\" (which is the case especially in most of shoujo romances), that is literally what his inner expressions are. He's obsessed his photographing, doesn't talk all that much, doesn't want to do things he finds embarrassing and regrets his past mistakes like all people do. I don't even think he lacks common sense or anything of the sorts. I know it sounds really crazy, but believe me, romance protagonists can have a personality! (even if it's a pretty boring personality technically speaking) Overall, he is a good character. Not flashy, not loud, not perfect. Just pure and believable.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is, of course, Teresa, the main heroine of the story. Her case is slightly different than Tada is. She's more active, very sweet and sometimes a little weird. What I love is how well she matches up Tada in their duo. While he is the thoughtful, quieter one, she's the one who often invites him to do stuff and her activity starts to reflect on him as the series goes along. She also understands her position in their world very well, as in one moment she decides to abandon her feeling because they seriously have no chance of becoming true and they would only make her feel worse. Her and Tada's relationship growth was also done in a respectful manner. While it was clear that the fire between them got lit in their first meeting, the show does a good job at developing and justifying their emotions with romantic moments spread throughout. And it is very clear that they fall for each other more and more and the show goes on.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the other characters are also worth talking about. As first, we have Ijuuin. He seems like the classic case of the side-kick friends which only purpose is making gags. Which is not only partially false, because he has a position in the story and his own romantic interest, but also doesn't even matter much, because his comedy actually works. I never even liked this type of heavy gag characters, yet his jokes are just spot on a lot of the time. I seriously didn't imagine that I would laugh so much during every episode, but Ijuuin made it that way. And I love him because of that. There is also Alec, Teresa's transfer mate, and subordinate. Hinako and Hajime, who sadly never got to solve the relationship between them presented in the first episodes. And Charles, probably the nicest guy ever.\\n\\n\r\nThere is really a lot to talk about all of them because Tada-kun is a heavily character driven show. One could say that some of them are just following certain personality archetypes, which I don't think is even true. An example; while Alec could be considered a bit of a Tsundere when interacting with a certain character, she acts completely different in front of someone else. That in itself means there is more to her than just one-way personality and that she isn't just blindly following the possibilities her \"archetype\" allows her to. Same could be said about all the other characters, which to me justifies that they are more than just dummies without a brain.\\n\\n\r\nI think it's pretty certain at this point that I really enjoyed watching Tada-kun. Yes, it could be considered generic, it could be considered unoriginal. Yet, the execution the anime comes with is good and I generally decided to not really care. Just to clarify, it's true that it becomes slightly messier as time goes on and the first episodes are ultimately the best show has, on the other hand, I wouldn't consider the latter half to be as bad as people make. Mainly because while the story overall stagnates, the very good characters are able to carry the show by themselves.\\n\\n\r\nArt was decent. Character designs don't look particularly memorable, yet they're at least nice to look at. The same can be said about the background and the animation itself. Everything is good, just forgettable. They maybe could've played around with the color palette a bit more. The sound was good. I think the voice actors, in particular, did a really good job and especially Ijuuin's was just seriously hilarious. OST did have some nice tracks though once again didn't come off as particularly interesting by itself.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-------\\n\\n\r\nSecond best comedy of the year after last season's Yuru Camp and an anime of the season for me in terms of expectation/result equation. Considering it's generic setup and decent, but not impressive, production values, Tada-kun really is as good of an anime as it could've been. And even if that probably doesn't mean much in the long run, it's enough for me to appreciate it now.",

            "content": "Tada Never Falls in Love is like a colorful bouquet of plastic flowers. From a distance, you might mistake it for the real thing. But upon closer inspection, you\u2019ll find it's merely a lifeless imitation. Factory produced from the most generic mold, identical to its fellow flowers rolling off the conveyor belt alongside it. \r\nUndeniably crafted with talent, Tadakoi offers refined background art and detailed character animation in place of quality writing. While the show had potential to be good with its solid audiovisuals, they are entirely wasted on generic characters and a poorly written story. \r\nThe story follows the titular Mitsuyoshi Tada, an uncharismaticphotographer who\u2019s tough past has prevented him from ever knowing love. Through a chance encounter, he meets an enthusiastic foreigner, Teresa. She acts overly excited, running around trying to hop fences and expressing a crazy amount of interest in a Samurai TV series, which seems to have given her some wrong impressions about Japan. All of it is played to comedic effect, it\u2019s fun and lighthearted enough in spite of being unrealistic, with her voice actress' upbeat performance to sell her personality well.\\n\\n\r\nThen, through another chance encounter, she ends up being stuck in the rain protecting a stray cat and getting splashed from all directions by water like the universe is punishing her for being nice. But to her rescue comes the lethargic Tada with an umbrella and an invitation to go to his family-owned cafe. Teresa compares what she believes is Tada\u2019s heroism to the samurai she idolizes in her favorite show, and that\u2019s how she falls in love. The cafe itself is lushly ornamented and has warm lighting to contrast the gray rainstorm, a cozy atmosphere for sure. She meets his family, has a meal, changes into dry clothes, thanks Tada, then heads home to the house she just moved into\u2026 which happens to be right next door. \\n\\n\r\nTada and Teresa\u2019s relationship feels contrived and hard to believe from the moment they first meet. An unbelievable amount of plot conveniences bring them together, it feels less like their relationship develops organically and more a writer forces them together. The show attempts to play off the cliched intro as a joke, but it\u2019s still lazy writing no matter how much you laugh about it. Aside from these contrivances, they leads don\u2019t have much chemistry with one another for the vast majority of the show. \\n\\n\r\nOften times it feels as though Tada\u2019s writing bends over backward in order to Fall in Love; his character and the relationship he has with Teresa never feel believable enough to be the foundation for the series. He\u2019s unrealistically oblivious to Teresa\u2019s pining over him, that is until the plot decides it\u2019s the right time for them to finally acknowledge their feelings. It\u2019s contrived for the sake of creating a compelling resolution, but in doing so it makes Tada difficult to look at as anything but a plot device for most of the show. There is no analysis of his personality that wouldn\u2019t lead to frustration, obliviousness for the sake of stalling the story is lazy writing and does not make good characters. Occasionally the show lampshades his emotional unawareness with the fact that his parents were killed in a car crash when he was younger, but we never see him from a personal enough perspective to understand why he became closed off or to what degree it affects him in the present. Why does it feel like these days more and more anime mistake emotionally-damaged characters for brain-damaged ones?\\n\\n\r\nIn one of the show\u2019s best and funniest episodes, narrated by Tada\u2019s cat Nyanko Big (a far more interesting character), the two protagonists share a sensitive moment that seemed on the surface like something out of a much better series. However, this is Tada-kun we\u2019re dealing with so there's practically no introspection; when Teresa catches Nyanko Big from a tree and falls back onto Tada only for him to catch her, it's an excellent timed moment of silence between the two yet it has almost no impact. While that moment showcases the very understated burgeoning love Teresa has for Tada, it never feels like a mutual romance. When they make eye contact in a seemingly mutually tender moment there is no sign anything is on Tada\u2019s mind. He\u2019s totally vacant. There\u2019s never a hint he might be in love outside of these moments where he might blush a little and only to return to normal moments later, unphased. Any potential for development is squashed, there is no satisfying growth for him. When the ending inevitably has to wrap up the story in a \u2018satisfying\u2019 way, his character arc takes a jarringly rapid change to compensate for the missing development. Leaving both him and the finale feeling underserved and artificial. \\n\\n\r\nAt least Teresa\u2019s feelings for Tada feel somewhat genuine. Lasting effects of their understated flirtations are seen in Teresa throughout the show. Her feelings develop more and more until she has to face them in a somewhat compelling resolution. Sadly, any potentially remarkable scenes that Teresa has get entirely snuffed out by Tada\u2019s dull idiocy, but they\u2019re also somewhat helped by the interesting visual language. Through subtle visual storytelling techniques we learn that she\u2019s pining for him from the start; over the course of the show we see brief moments of her lost in thought looking at him with starry eyes. It\u2019s not one-dimensional drama like Tada\u2019s; she gets enough scenes describing her life situation for us to know that she is constantly considering the arranged marriage she\u2019s in and how it ensures that she could never have a relationship with Tada. Her dilemma is miles more compelling than anything else the series offers emotionally, but that\u2019s thanks to the strong directing rather than the writing. \\n\\n\r\nPlenty of care has been put into the visuals. There\u2019s no shortage of small but purposeful details added to the settings the cast inhabit; homes lined with photos of memories from previous episodes or ones that refer to their backstories. Is it enough to outweigh the mediocre characterization? No, not by a long shot, but at least it\u2019s something to keep you engaged with it and tells you that the director cared about their craft. Where the visuals are more effective is the comedy. With the director of Monthly Girl\u2019s Nozaki-kun, it\u2019s clear to see why the comedy here is so strong; jokes are well timed and there\u2019s so much character animation to telegraph a joke and convey the cast\u2019s personalities. Of course, when jokes are derived from the bland characters they almost always fall flat. \\n\\n\r\nWhere the majority of my gripes come in is the side characters. This is a rom-com after all, so there is quite a few of them. None of them make up for what the protagonists lack, a few even bring the whole show down. Most of them are incredibly generic one-note cardboard cutouts, the ones that do receive development are somehow made even worse with insufferable episodes dedicated to telling us the boring story of characters that I can\u2019t imagine anyone would care about. There\u2019s Teresa\u2019s friend/servant who traveled with her to Japan, Alec. Her whole character is just the tough girl who is overprotective of Teresa because a few shallow reasons told to us through a backstory. She often beats up the clown of the group, generic clown kid who\u2019s name I literally can\u2019t remember. His only purpose was comic relief, and his animation was the most detailed of the group to showcase his comedic personality, but in truth, everything about him felt so cringy with an overdone voice performance to add even more annoyance. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few others who hang around the group like Tada\u2019s sister and occasionally the prince engaged to Teresa. I somewhat appreciated how Teresa\u2019s suitor wasn\u2019t portrayed as an evil threat like many tropey arranged marriage stories do, but instead as a nice guy who respects her wishes. However, his passivity also leads him to have no impact in the story. He\u2019s surprisingly forgettable for one of the more unusual archetypes, but the show wastes all of his on-screen presence, leaving him a bland cipher like the rest of the recurring cast. \\n\\n\r\nHajime, or more commonly known as Pin-senpai is undoubtedly the worst part of the show by a wide margin. Introduced by him creepily ogling the female cast to ascertain their breast sizes, defusing the saccharine factor this series was going for whenever he appears on-screen. He\u2019s constantly yelling, so much yelling with such an irritating voice. He is never content with just fading into the background while on-screen with everyone else, he has to scream as loudly as possible whenever he speaks. Having an obnoxious character like Pin is fine for a comedy series of this type; but what he screams about, no, what his whole character is about, is so pointless and weird, sometimes downright creepy. He adores a model, Hina, to an absurd degree because he loves big boobs\u2026 You can have a perverted character, that\u2019s fine, but he is over exaggerated to an obnoxious and unbelievable degree. None of his jokes are ever funny unless its other characters making fun of him; like how they used Hina merchandise to trick him into losing their photography club game. \\n\\n\r\nPin\u2019s character arc seemed little more than an excuse for him to seem less like an annoying walking cliche, and it fell flat. Sadly, the show gives him an entire episode meant to show he had some kind of compassion. His character had potential, with his childhood friend Hinako (notice the name??) who is so very clearly the model from the moment she\u2019s introduced right next to the pinup poster. Throughout the show, there's plenty of hints to indicate she's in love with him, despite him not realizing the model he ogles ever day is actually his friend. Hinako looks the exact same as she does in her bikini shoots, except that she wears glasses. It's such a stupid conflict that the show lampshades the lazy writing by having Alec point out that it's obvious. This stupid conflict damages the believability of both Pin and Hinako because other than the cookie-cutter personalities they have nothing else to prove their unlikable stories aren't all there is to them. \\n\\n\r\nTheir relationship arc literally culminates in Hinako disappointed at how Pinhead never realized she was the model all along, but she\u2019s happy that he at least likes her idol personality and her boobs. Wow, great themes Tadakoi. Their episode is the most boring because of how one-dimensional the situation and characters are, but also one of the most distasteful ones. I guess you could say Hinako technically had character development, she discovered her fetish for cucking herself. Amazing. But Pinhead still has no redeeming value even after we\u2019re forced to sit through his \u2018development\u2019 episode. Screw that guy.\\n\\n\r\nBarely anything happens in Tadakoi until the final few episodes, that's when it finally decides there needs to be some kind of progress made before the end. Regardless of the artificial developments made by the end, it's always predictable; right from episode one, you can guess how the story will play out. Perhaps with more interesting characters, it could have been watchable in spite of these flaws, but instead, it's just aggressively bland. No amount of lush sceneries and trained directing could save dull, lazy writing. At least the opening song is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nTadakoi is the variety of mediocrity that will pass through the anime community with no impact, then inevitably be forgotten forever. You might get something out of it if you\u2019re a fan of the director or if you're new to anime. Otherwise, I suggest you skip this generic fluff.",

            "content": "The only thing I can say is, this show gives you the same content that you saw before on other shows about romcom. And you know what kind plot it has. The only thing that makes this show enjoyable is how the story progress. It doesn't matter if it has the same formula for the beginning and the ending atleast it manage to connect those parts and don't make the story kind of mess up.\r\nArt Style, I don't know why I have to explain it. Everything I watch has the same style unless its 3D,2.5D or CGI then I guess I can give an opinionabout that. But if you are going to say, \"How about the pictures? Aren't they good?\" Yes, yes they are. But nothing is different. A picture within a picture, what's the difference?\\n\\n\r\nSame to Sound/Music, unless Music itself was the topic of the show. For Voice Acting? Nothing aswell. Unless they try to speak English which is funny but nothing more. I'm not hating how they speak it, I just mentioning it because I had nothing to mention about the Sound/Music.\\n\\n\r\nFor the Characthers, well, they also similar to others but atleast they pick the good ones. And if you observe, all characters in this show can be equally devided as partners. So good news for Shippers, I guess... But nonetheless, the Main Characters are fun to watch together. The English title of this show tells our Male Protagonist, Tada-kun never falls in love, and of course, it wasn't true at all. Thats why it has a Romance Tag.\\n\\n\r\nDo I enjoy watching this? Yes, yes I do. I don't care if it has a overused plot or a terrible presentation (For your prespective). I like watching this kind of shows and you might think now that starting from the beginning I was biased  but I keep it equal as possible. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, its good show, and if you think its overused plot shouldn't be given a chance, I feel so sorry for you. It doesn't matter if its overused. The thing that matters how its presented,how it showed and how it progress. I rather have the same meal for years than to starve to death. What I was pointing out is, overused doesn't mean terrible or bad. But regardless, this show surely isn't bad, the score already says it all. I wonder why. It has the same plot as the last anime I just give a review about yet they are given different treatment, sigh.",

            "content": "What ingredients really make up a good rom-com show these days? I\u2019m not going to lie, I have high expectations when a creator wants to make a show with romance themes. As an original anime, Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai (Tada Never Falls in Love) seems to be a show that would entice me with its premise. Unfortunately, it dropped the ball as each episode passed on and eventually reached the point of being broken.\r\nOriginal anime like this doesn\u2019t fall into the trap of a weak adaptation. It has no material to follow after all. The story involves Mituyoshi Tada as he meets a foreignernamed Teresa Wagner during her trip to Japan. As a rom-com, you should definitely expect love to develop between the pair, right? Well, that would be the case if Tada actually understands it. To be fair, love is a complicated subject but for Tada, he treats it indifferently. There\u2019s undeniable chemistry between the two yet the show seems to rarely make a connection between them. However, the first few episodes did draw a big curiosity out of me. Teresa brings in a lot of her own personality and interest into the show as well. The idea of a Western foreigner coming to Japan has a lot of potential. Even from the first few episodes, she shows a lot of curiosity about Japan. It\u2019s also shown that she is an avid fan of Rainbow Shougun, a fictional TV drama with samurai themes. My impression of her from early episodes is that she is a bit airheaded but kind to just about everyone. This is a contrast to Alec Magritte, Teresa\u2019s caretaker who seems to be intensely protective of her friend. Unlike Teresa, she is blunt and often takes aggressive moves to protect her. That doesn\u2019t mean she is a cruel person though. Alec is mainly close to Teresa because of her past and isn\u2019t as easy to make friends with. She often gets into oddball moments with Kaoru because of his flirtatious personality and attempts to hit on her.\\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019ve probably noticed by now but the show has a small character cast. The majority of the characters you meet in the first episode are the ones you\u2019ll get to know for rest of the season. This also includes Tada\u2019s classmates such a Hajime Sugimoto from the Photography club and class president Hinako Hasegawa. The show does also make time to give these two a spotlight in early episodes although it\u2019s more of a tease than anything else. To me, it\u2019s goofy and funny although also unoriginal. The idea of a girl living a double life with a love interest being oblivious isn\u2019t new in rom-coms. There\u2019s not much uniqueness to either Hajime or Hinako in terms of character development. They also fall into the character archetype that you can find in any series that takes place at school. Even more questionable is a character named Kentarou Yamashita who enters the show as a comic relief. There\u2019s a comical reason why he\u2019s nicknamed Yamashita Dog with his behavior. The character chemistry he shares with Yui Tada (Mitsuyoshi\u2019s sister) is pretty forgettable honestly. That\u2019s actually a big part that holds the show back from achieving success. It feels like as each episode passes on, the characters become less and less intriguing. Teresa and Tada gets sidetracked as the show tests the viewers\u2019 patience. I say this with an open mind because I want to love them. Even for characters like Charles de Loire, I wanted him to be more engaging in the show besides just being a guy with French nobility. His role as a fianc\u00e9 to Teresa originally gave me the feeling that he may be a love rival to Tada. Unfortunately, this series doesn\u2019t really capitalize no bringing much romantic drama. Tada is often too stoic and thinks straightforward without much emotion to bring much interest. Teresa is too energetic that contrasts with both characters\u2019 personalities. When you mix these ingredients together, the end product isn\u2019t appealing.\\n\\n\r\nWell, you\u2019re probably thinking if any character in the show is worth paying attention to overall. Thankfully, there is and it\u2019s not even a human. Nyanko Big is a stray cat that Tada found and adopted a decade ago. The furball has a lot of human personality and one episode even focuses on his little cat adventure. This anime needed episodes like this to bring out a more refreshing style of storytelling. Because let\u2019s face it, a majority of the episodes feels the same. I can\u2019t say this without shaking my head honestly because I really expected more from the writer involved. Yoshiki Nakamura previously worked on Skip Beat and that bought out a refreshing outlook on the rom-com genre. What does Tada-kun bring out instead? It\u2019s a half-assed generic anime story that somehow made me care just about anything else than our two main leads. By the time this show reaches near its end, you may be wondering if Tada and Teresa are even worth being the main characters. It\u2019s almost sad to see how the cookie crumbles. I\u2019m not going to lie. The suspenseful subplot about Alec\u2019s love interest made me more curious than to see if Tada and Teresa will get together in the end or not.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my disappointment in the storytelling, there\u2019s a lot of good to say about the animation quality. This was expected as some of the staff previously worked on Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. In essence, the show is colorful with a sense of youth. The springtime backgrounds really brings out the setting that\u2019s sprinkled with vibrant colors. Character designs also look elegant especially for characters like Teresa, Charles, and Alec. Even comedic moments are timed right with the body language and humorous expressions. There are also windows of moments that makes couple pairings impactful especially for the case of Teresa and Tada. While the show lacks impact on storytelling, the technical quality definitely deserves some praise. Even the photography elements got my attention with the precise shots and camera angles. Similarly, the music of the series brings an element of beauty thanks to the modern talents of Yukari Hashimoto. She also previously worked on Nozaki-kun and there\u2019s definitely a similar feel in the music for both shows. The voice cast also did a phenomenal job at portraying their characters. Nyanko Big especially gets praise from me as a cat that is made larger than life. Even Teresa and Charles deserves some attention for their voice being filled with elegance and charm. They behave like characters of upper class in their home nation and that\u2019s something I find believable.\\n\\n\r\nWith all due respect, it\u2019s really hard for me to say that Tada-kun succeeded in the end with what it offered. The show started with a lot of promise but ultimately stabbed itself in the foot. It really felt like a test of patience for viewers that degenerated into a cheesy rom-com story. Characters like Alec and Nynako Big overshadowed them early on and it\u2019s hard to look back. I\u2019m not a big fan of photography and this anime is definitely not worth a thousand words.",

            "content": "TLDR:\r\nTada is a nice and enjoyable watch that keeps you interested in what to come. If you want a solid, bubbly and romantic anime that isn't a repetitive washing of a romance, look no further. \r\nRatings~ Story [7] Art [7] Sound [6] Character [6] Enjoyment [8] Overall [7]\r\nStory [7]\r\nPerhaps a strength of the anime thus far. Tada progresses well and adds to the overall appeal of the bubbly anime. The reoccurring use of photography as the main theme holds it all together and in the end, we are left with an interesting anime in which, our attention is kept focused on the relationships within theseries.\\n\\n\r\nArt [7]\\n\r\nIt presents a unique, yet quality approach to their intended romantic appeal. Soft and nice on the eyes and is consistent in its application. Considering that the series is set on photography, it's to be expected that the art is up to par and so far, it has delivered.\\n\\n\r\nSound [6]\\n\r\nOp and ending tracks are fine. The voice acting is a lacklustre here and there but gets the job done. Nothing great of note here, especially as the plot doesn't really put an emphasis on sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [6] \\n\r\nTada is a mix of extremely different yet familiar characters. They work well together and the series allows them to interact with each other and develop their relationships. However, I can't help but notice hollowness of some characters. It seems to me that Tada presents a character, says \"ok this is your background\" and then chucks them into the group to make them do things (*cough* Gentar\u014d *cough* -_-). As a result, we are left with some noticeably uninteresting and forgetful characters early on into the series\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [8]\\n\r\nIt's really interesting to see how the characters pan out, early on in this series and its all due to the plots situation. The meshing of drastically different characters and how they interact with each other is enjoyable to watch and I can't help but wonder \"whats going to happen to x and y next\". The combination of seemingly night and day characters is what really has pushed this anime past \"just another good watch\".\\n\\n\r\nOverall [7]\\n\r\nTada presents us with an interesting plot and drives us to watch. Through its interestingly stereotypical characters, and the unpredictability of their interactions, we are left with a great bubbly watch that you will look forward to and will lighten your day by even just a little.",

            "content": "Warning: this review contains spoilers.\r\nIf you're looking for an anime with bad characters, over the top cliches, undeveloped romances, drama just for the sake of drama and big events that happens because of no reason at all, you've come to the right place. Many people would argue that this anime is better then that because it had 2 or 3 good episodes at the begining, but don't let youreself be fooled. \r\nAnimation and sound: are decent. They don't stand out but neither drag the series lower that it actualy is.\r\nCharacters: here is the main problem of this anime. The characters seems \r\n to be takenout of a garbage can. They are one dimensional and full of cliches. They don't develop of the course of the show(except for the MC, and it's rather poor) and in some cases they are rather anoying. Don't believe me? Let's see what we've got:\\n\r\n-The princess from another country. She came for what looks to be a \"study trip\". Her inteligence  is below average.\\n\r\n-Her tsundere childhood friend. Good at most things. Protects the princess. Has the strength and moves of an elite trained soldier.\\n\r\n-The guy that princess is suposed to marry. He comes later into the show. He seems like the perfect guy from every single aspect.\\n\r\n-The MC that is not interested into girls, only to fall in love at the end of series. Tragical past. \\n\r\n-The MC's best friend. Nice guy but very egocentric.\\n\r\n-The leader of club senpai. Highly perverted. He loves an idol.\\n\r\n-The only girl in the group. Looks nerdy but hidenly it's the idol that senpai loves. (Weird thing is no one from the initial group seems to notice)\\n\r\n-The MC's little sister.\\n\r\n-Another guy just to have someone who the little sister can love.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters seem to stay in the description above, having very little semnificative traits.\\n\\n\r\nThe story: Here is my problem with the story- characters seem to act on nothing but impulse and events seem to happen just for the sake of it. To give you an short example: in an episode a character seems to find a mising cat(which was pretty big deal then) by talking to a cat. That scene it was never explained and still stands as the most example of bad writing this season. I still don't know why the audience just accepted it. But enough with , let's see the story in more details.\\n\r\nThe story presents the love story between Teresa,a princess from a fictional country and Tada, an ordinary japanese boy. Teresa is eleventh grade, so we can asume she is around 16-17 years old and is to become queen at age of 18. Why is it fixed for her to become queen so soon, with the current king stil alive it is never explained. Anyway, our future queen probably prepares hard for the time she will be queen, in order to provide a better future for an entire country, right? WRONG! She takes what it looks to be a \"study vacantion\" in a foreing country which she likes. Why she loves the country? Because she saw a tv show from that country and aparently likes it so much that she even learned the language.\\n\r\nThat's why i writted before that her inteligence is below average. Most of the decision she takes are half-baked and defy any logic an ordinary person would have. In most cases her way of thinking is closer to a 5 years old with mental disorder then to a future queen. A good example of why traditional monarchy failed.Aparently her childhood friend came with her , and for good reason. Who would ever trust this girl alone? \\n\r\nBut let's continue the story. When the girls were going to their residence in Japan, aparently the princess got separated from her friend. How? She simply got out of the subway at a random , for no reason at all. And only noticed she was alone, at the wrong place, in a foreign country way to late. To make situation worse, her entire papers, moneys and even her phone, was at her friend. A normal person here would try to reunite with her companion, but not our genius princes. She decides to visit what looks to be a tourist attraction, for no concrete reason at all . What is even more disturbing is that at some point, she decides to jump in a river, because it looked like that river from the show she liked. Lucky for her , there was another character that stop her: Tada.\\n\r\nHe is a simple boy , who lives with her gramp and her sister. They own a coffee shop. He met the princess at that tourist attraction and ended up taking her home. Not for some pervert reason because he is aparently not interested in love. The princess is reunited with her friend, and aparently they live next door to caffeteria Tada family owns. For obvious reason thei real identity is kep secret. Despite hard criticism, this was the best part of this anime.\\n\r\nAnd so the story starts, bad characters come, romances are started only to never be concluded and at some point even some bad drama comes in. What i'm talking about with this non-sense drama? That one episode when Teresa and Tada talked about their tragic past. What bad writting? Well, aparently Tada's tragic story was having his parents died in a car accident, when he was a kid, when he and his dad had a little fight. This is the ultimate cliche drama ever saw. But don't worry , Teresa's story comes and it's something original. I mean, you have to be stupid to use this kind of a story as a cliche. Aparently Teresa also had a tragic moment in her childhood, on pair with Tada's. Poor girl has make her friend cry. When they were 6 years old. The only tragic thing in this episode is the writing.\\n\r\nThen , finally comes the romance. Considering this being a romance anime you would expect to see some development. Wrong again! Most romances between side characters remain unconcluded. Unconcluded is a strong word since we only had hints of characters liking eachother. Except for the cats. They definatly got the best romance in this show.\\n\r\nThe romance of the main characters is even worse. The MC only realises he likes the princess in the last episode. There they have a nice talk , where she listens to him and admits she is in love with him. Aparently it was love at first sight. Why they waited till the last moment to realizes it? Beats me, but if I had to asume, i'd say it's because of bad writing. But her having already a fiance means they can't be together. So they sadly part ways. And here things start to make no-sense once again. Aparently the wedding is such a big deal that they end up in that way, for the sake of drama. Then the guy she is supposed to marry, cancels the wedding like it was nothing. Only for the last scene of this anime to show Teresa and Tada reunited togheter , aparently in a very random way. I call it BS!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I literally watched the last 5 episodes at 2x speed, only to make it end faster. It was painfull to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, i gave it a 4. I probably won't recomand this anime to anyone i don't hate. I belive it is a mockery of a romance.",

            "content": "While Wotakoi mostly focused on the comedy aspect of rom-com, Tadakoi's focus lay more on the romance aspect. Obviously it isn't just a romance, it definitely had some amusing moments early on while they were laying the groundwork for the more heavy drama laden romantic chase in the waning episodes. It almost feels unfair to compare the two shows as I have been doing with them both, but it's just so difficult for me not to. I watched them on the same day, back-to-back for eleven weeks straight. They're the same genre, but each with different focal points and strengths, which made me appreciate whatboth Wotakoi and Tadakoi did differently, and in some cases, better than each other. I mentioned it in my Wotakoi review, but I'd watch Tadakoi for the dramatic romance first, then switch to Wotakoi for the lighthearted comedy. They were perfect foils for my Thursdays. But now, to dive deeper into the nuances of Tadakoi.\\n\\n\r\nAmong the multitudes of things that Tadakoi did correctly, I think their biggest win lies in the characters. They did such a good job getting you to care about them and learn their quirky personalities, each of which was hiding some deeper insecurity that was, unfortunately, not touched on for some of the less important characters due to lack of time. By episodes five, I felt that I had a pretty good connection with all of the characters on the screen and, if not for the lack of episodes, I feel like each could have gone through extremely satisfying arcs. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about the few episodes, in the end it didn't matter that much, the show was always about Mitsuyoshi and Theresa. I feel like too much of a focus on the supporting cast would have taken away from the impact of the main love story, which dominates the remaining episodes and doesn't disappoint with its twists and turns. In fact, I felt as if I was right there with Mitsuyoshi, getting slowly drawn in by this strange, quirky foreign girl. Yes, I got so invested that I even teared up when Mitsuyoshi's version of the ending came on in episode eleven and I think that speaks volumes as to my feelings on the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing that really stands out when I look at Tadakoi, are the general expectations laid upon it. Everyone, including me, thought that it was going to be completely generic after three or so episodes. And from that outlook, it definitely seemed like it would be. But it did such a great job at subverting those expectations. I, like so many others, thought we'd get that classic \"everyone's ship sails, except for that one asshole who gets in the way of the main couple\". But everything about that sentence was wrong when you compare that to Tadakoi. Only one ship really sails, and the others are somewhat hinted, but never confirmed. Probably best of all, the romantic rival isn't the classic jerk who doesn't really love the girl, hates the protagonist, etc. Charles was legitimately a great guy, and it made him an even better character in the grand scheme of things. That was such a refreshing take on the trope, that I just had to find time to mention it here.\\n\\n\r\nThose are just a couple of things that I love about Tadakoi and there's so much more to rave about, but that would take up far too much time. Before I conclude, I just have to comment on my favorite part of the show, which is the ending song. I love that song. It's among one of my favorite endings of all time, though it's personally in tight competition with Alternative GGO's ending song for ED of the season.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to come up with any complaints with Tadakoi, I'd have to say that my biggest gripe is the fact that they opened so many story lines with no intention of ever finishing them. Maybe I'm incorrect with that and we'll get a spinoff or OVA that ties up many of the loose ends regarding the supporting cast, who kind of get the shaft for the latter half of the show. Not a bad thing, in my opinion, but I can see why it'd be a negative for some. There may be a little too much melodrama for my liking too, but I sort of feel like it was all necessary, to drive Mitsuyoshi forward.\\n\\n\r\nDespite those little gripes, I adore this little love story. It was self-contained and did enough to set it apart from other romances for me. I won't be knee jerk and say that it's my favorite romance of all time, or even rom-com, but it comes damn close in certain aspects. Dare I even say that I liked it more than Wotakoi overall? My score certainly reflects that. And, while I may have scored it a little higher than many would say is deserving, I have to say that it does deserve it for all the enjoyment it gave me for thirteen weeks. In fact, Tadakoi may just be my anime of the season.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: This is my first anime review, so I've probably gotten something \"wrong\". But I've had animes that I liked and didn't like and I can tell you that this one is one of the former. I'm probably fan-insert-gender-neutral-term-ing (jk, I'm not a crazy feminist) here, so take everything I say with a pinch of salt.\r\nFirst off title. \"Tada doesn't fall in love\". ok, that's all I have to say about the title, but keep that in mind if you're gonna watch the anime. Plis continue reading my review. (ooh, and also, I know that the poster looks boring (that's what i thought too) butthe anime is pretty good, so give it a shot)\\n\\n\r\nI don't know, maybe it's just me, but I absolutely *love* this anime. It's something light on the heart, packed with laughs and generally heart-warming. The first scene alone put a big smile on my face! Shortly, the art is beautiful, the music is light and complementing, the voices are on point with the characters, and I feel very optimistic about this anime. Also, I know how it feels to be borderline frightened by anime after watching heart-breaking ones, so if you're trying to avoid your daily dose of depression, don't be worried to watch this. It's not the type that will end in heartbreak.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nSo, story, I'll admit, there's not much brewing (at least I hope not). The anime sorta gives me Slice of Life feels, but given the no-so-ordinary circumstances of the characters, it's not quite... how you say in my language, \"tepat\", or fitting, I guess, in the SoL category. The \"suasana\", I don't know this in English, is a well-blended mix of ordinary life, funny cues, and just a bit of crazy (like less than 1% Gintama-crazy). In the end, there's this sort of happy-homey feeling that makes you strangely feel... welcome? I don't know, watch it yourself. Seriously, just watch the first episode (pls) and you'll get me.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nJaw-dropping. Drawings are clean-cut and just nice with thin borders and accentuated shadows. The backgrounds are beautiful too and (this is gonna sound cheesy) really highlight the hospitable blend of human and natural Japan (that Doga Kobo wants you to see anyway). I'm no art expert, so I'm not gonna put 10 because I wouldn't even know what qualifies for a 10, but this... This is something that my gut tells me is worth a special something \\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nBackground music is very subtle and feels customized to complement every other scene. But that's not the main highlight of sound. The main highlight *must* be the voices. The characters' voices are really the music of this anime. Their sounds feel really... real, and flow with the characters' scene behaviors and personalities really well. ESPECIALLY (and you know I'm serious when I'm typing in FULL CAPS) Mamoru Miyano's Kaoru. Credit's given where credit's due, and Miyano really does have the credit due. His cheeky, and wavery yet simultaneously confident voice alone, I admit, plays a big factor in why I give sound 10. Here; here is where I say, and really mean it:\\n\r\nGood job.\\n\r\nOh ya, the ED is like ok, I guess, but the OP is nicer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThese guys are a fun, relaxed (but somehow also energetic...) bunch, that makes me laugh, smile, spit water, then smile again. There aren't any \"chibi\" scenes so it's not really \"that\" kind of comedy (though I'm not sure, myself, what that means), but it still has its outrageously funny scenes, and for about 1/3 to 3/5 of the episode (I'm not sure this is true, but, whatever, UR NOT MY MOM) I'm left laughing out loud (for real). In between the laughs though, there are genuine smiles to be had at the warm friendships and love everyone has for each other. Each character acts distinctly from each other and doesn't change in behavior, but they all get along well (I say that, but, fufufu). They all bear semblance to certain typical archetypes but are more unique than not. The way they interact together is both funny, and soothing, and really act in a way that both makes sense, and can please a watcher (you). I get the sense that Doga Kobo really put effort in planning and executing the timing of each scene, to really complement the comedic timing, along with the occasional (but, again, far from Gintama-crazy level) outrageous comedic \"deus ex machina\" cues. I'm rambling. Right. Anyway, watch the first damn episode, you won't regret it!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI really do like this anime, and want to see more episodes. There's not much else to say here, other than this:\\n\r\nIf you've read thus far, open CrunchyRoll and watch the first episode immediately. Seriously. I'm not joking. You WILL love it.",

            "content": "When I reviewed 3D Kanojo Real Girl and Woatku Love is Hard For A Otaku I mentioned that were two romcom shows that were competing with each other? Well, there was actually three romcom anime that were competing each and that anime is Tada Never Falls in love. Unlike the other two Tada Never Fall in Love is an anime original probably meaning it's not as restrictive as the other two it has to follow the source carefully or else fans of the source material would riot. Also unlike the other two where I watched them weekly, I decided to wait until once it finishedairing and I wanted to see people's opinion about it before I even invest my time with this show. While people options on the show were mixed compared to Wotaku I still wanted to give a shot because I wanted to see if the show is actually better than Woatku as well not being worse than 3D Kanojo Real Girl. So after marathoning all 13 episodes of Tada Never Fall in Love all I can say it's pretty solid romcom anime that I liked. Not on the same level as Wotaki but still good enough to be one of the better animes of Spring 18 season.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story follows a boy named Tada who doesn't know about any form of love. During a regular day in the cherry blossoms, Tada decides to take pictures there and while he's taking pictures he meets a transfer student from a European country called Larsenburg named Teresa. Upon arriving in Japan she gets's lost from her travel comparison. Like with any typical male lead Tada decides to help her by taking her to her grandfather's coffee shop from there relationships will form and will Tada finally understand the meaning of love.\\n\\n\r\nThe story for Tada Never Fall in Love is pretty solid overall. Like with any good romcom anime the story is heavily character driven where it relay on the characters from the interactions to relationships more than the plot itself and surprisingly the show does a good job at being a charted driven story.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main things that I liked about Tada Never falls in love it how it gives the charterers the appropriate screen-time that they need. The main characters will obviously get most screen-time while the side characters get they screen-time that they need without overstaying the welcome or having barely any screen-time at. This alone makes it's main and some of the side characters more memorable. It does a great job as tacking the themes of friendship, love and understanding each other in the more realistic way where every single character shows a different side to love and friendship making they character interactions stand out in the process which speaking off.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I liked about Tada Never falls in love is how it was able to avoid most romcom cliches that seen to plague mainly romcom shows such as a generic lead, a tsundere main love interest, long and complected love triangles, harems etc for the most apart least.\\n\r\nIt also does a good job as tacking the themes of friendship, love, royalty love and understanding each other in the more realistic way where every single character shows a different side to love and friendship making they character interactions stand out in the process which speaking off. The characters interactions as well the plot twist in this show were well handed as not only the interactions for each character was great but the way the plot twist in the series which I won't spoil.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about Tada Never falls in love is how slow paced the romance is. Unlike most other romcoms where the romance elements feel underdeveloped thanks to lack of focus on the actual romance Tada and Terca slowly build a relationship with each in a way that is satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on about how good this show is but I think it's talk about the show's flaws.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters while I appreciate the slower pacing in the show in favour for better chararter development for the mains I thought at times the first half was too slow for my liking and what I mean by this is certain scenes in the show seen to drag way longer than it should.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of drag the second issue that I have with this show it was the comedy itself or in this case too much. I know the show eventually fixed this problem in the last couple of episode but my god the comedy in this show to drag on to a point where at times it overtakes the romance elements. Not only that but the comedy itself just become unfunny and at times repetitive.\\n\r\nThe final issue that I have with the show is that it's how predictable it became. Now being predictable doesn't equal bad but there were certain character expressions in the second half ultimately predicted the shows ending. I know shows like this are meant to be predictable but I honestly wish they didn't have to make it this very oblivious to the viewer with theses certain character expressions.\\n\r\nOverall despite it having some issues, I thought the story was good and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the characters to Tada Never Falls in love I thought they were pretty solid for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nOur main protagonist Tada is a pretty solid romcom lead. While he may not be a complex and well written as other romcom leads but he still a very interesting and likeable chararters nonetheless. He's chararter development while more in the predictable side was still fun and enjoyable to watch.\\n\r\nTeresa\u2019s is a pretty good romcom female lead. She is an overall nice person who is kind to every-time but at the same time she is very royalty and does not show any arrogance in terms of expectations where she is the Princess of Larsenburg as well being the heir of Queen's throne.\\n\\n\r\nWhile she doesn't as developed as much as Tada she's still a nicely developed and fun character that I liked.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the main characters were great the side characters not so much. Apart from Alec and Kaworu the characters are nothing more than comedic devices than actual characters. It got to a point where if you removed every character from the Photography Club apart from Tada, Teresa, Alce, and Kaworu the story would not change one bit. This alone was the weakest part of Tada Never Fall in Love.\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nCompare to the other two this show visually is the best looking of the three.\\n\r\nThe art-style of the show was very appealing to look thanks to its soft use of colour palettes for the character designs and the background scenery. The character designs themselves were great and well drawn. Also, the lighting and use of camera shots in this were brilliant and well thought out.\\n\r\nThe actual animation while basic still pretty nice for what it was.\\n\r\n7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in Tada Never Falls in Love is honestly for the most part forgettable. Sure there are a couple of tracks that were solid but at a lot of the time they are not that memorable at all\\n\r\nThe opening theme Otomodachi Film by Masayoshi Ooishi is a great and catchy opening that fits well with the upbeat tone of the series.\\n\r\nThe ending theme Love Song by Manaka Iwami is a cute and adorable ending theme that I really enjoyed.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is a bit of a mixed bag overall\\n\r\nWhile some Seiyuus did a good job others ranged from okay to overdoing they performances where it became quite annoying.\\n\r\nAt this time of the review there is no English Dub for this series but hopefully, it will get one sometime in the future.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nSo that was Tada Kun Never falls in Love.\\n\\n\r\nA flawed but good romcom series that I enjoyed quite a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was solid for the most part, the characters were mostly good the visuals are good. The only negatives things I can say about this show were the mediocre treatment for the side characters, too much comedy and at times slow pacing that seems to drag. Other than this Tada Never Falls in Love is a pretty solid series. While it's not better than Wotaku it's still a hell of a lot better than Takagi san and especially 3D Kanojo Real Girl.\\n\r\nFinal Score 7/10",

            "content": "A romantic anime this season? Hmm.... never been a huge fan of the romance genre, but sure I'll give it a go. Whoa, Tada-kun is surprisingly good for a romance anime. I like it. It's a different type of romance, but one which I end up liking. \r\nStory: Tada-kun is about a Japanese guy, Tada Mitsuyoshi, falling in love with a gaijin, Teresa Wagner, who's actually a Princess from Lux... I mean Larsenburg :v. The story is quite interesting, because they develop the romantic relationship very well. Teresa was the one who liked Tada at first of course, when their eyes first met :v, butthen as they get to know each other more, Tada eventually falls in love with her too! Not to forget the fantastic friends they have who's always supporting then. Ijuuin, Tada's best friend, Yui, Tada's younger sister, Alexandra aka Alec, Teresa's best friend and guardian, and of course, Charles, Teresa's supposed husband-to-be. The ending is.... rather cliche, because Tada ends up with Teresa and not the other way around(as always with romance anime), which I don't exactly like. I mean, usually in a love triangle yo'd expect the 2 guys to fight for the girl but not in Tada-kun. Charles let Teresa go to Tada, which is quite disappointing, I was expecting a fight to the death between Tada and Charles(although that'd be very ugly) What I really like about the story is how they manage to fuse romance and comedy and turning Tada-kun into a Romcom anime, which is pretty entertaining, to say the least. Ah, last but not least, RAINBOW SHOGUN!!!\\n\r\nRating: 8.9/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The animation is excellent for Tada-kun, the way the scenery and facial expressions are animated. You can tell the producers put in a lot of effort to make the animation look good.\\n\r\nRating: 8.8/10 \\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: Probably the most catchy opening this season. And the ost, light-hearted. \\n\r\nRating: 8.2/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I love the way the producers approached character development for this anime. At first, Tada is portrayed as a rather quiet, introverted person with Teresa being the extroverted, happy-go-lucky person who always smiles. But then, as the two of them get to know each other better, Tada-kun starts to open up to Teresa, even sharing his very personal feelings about his past. Now that, is very interesting. Oh and dont forget Tada's best pal Ijuuin who's always supporting Tada to the end, even going so far as to follow Tada all the way to Lux... Larsenburg. And Alec too, being the support pillar of Teresa during Teresa's saddest moments and Charles, the very kind and friendly person who only wants Teresa to be happy. To me he's the MVP of the anime, because he gave up his love for Teresa in order for Teresa to pursue her love, Tada. That, is a very manly thing to do. \\n\r\nRating: 9.3/10\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Tada-kun is a very good romcom for all the romcom anime fans. Definitely recommend watching it! The criticism that I can give is that, the ending is too cliche and uninteresting, I mean, would not 2 guys fight over 1 girl?! \\n\\n\r\nFinal rating: 8.8/10",

Then again it does make you fall in love with the characters which I must say were really well created and to be honest when your eyes catch this awesome art and animation with the perfect soundtrack and background music accompanying them it gets a bit hard not tolove the anime even though it has some shortcomings esp. later in. \\n",

            "content": "Let me get this clear THE STORY OF THIS ANIME IS GOOD! I dunno why people giving this anime a hard time because of some over used plot or some stupid cliches from other animes. But you know what? It doesn't matter, because this anime delivered the story quite well, Kodus to the guys behind this! I don't care if I watched a whole bunch of these, i still won't get bored from it. (YouGuysWatchAlotOfKdramasWhenInfactItsJustAllTheSame!) The point here is, YOU GUYS who watched so many \"Master Pieces\" doesn't have the time (because your too busy with your 2D waifus!) to re-evaluate the quality and valueof some animes such as these, because some of you have set the BARS too high based on what you have seen on the past and you became a picky person just to suit your taste buds. These guys think they know all about it on how anime RomComs should be, well, if you're so good then stop reading this and stop making stupid reviews and then write your own story and share it so we could criticize it as well! I mean, People come on! Atleast appreciate the effort and time spent on this! \\n\\n\r\nStory: The story is not bad, it's just that other people are thinking that this anime doesn't have any originality so they're making it look bad by comparing and downsizing and making rants about it. The story is not over the top with some huge twist and it's not too dramatic like any other animes (like DiF) do just to get your attention, it's just Plain Old Sweet Love Story, Its enough to tugg your heart. Well, just don't look at the ratings and see for yourself. \\n\\n\r\nWell here goes, the story is about Tada-kun, let me introduce him a lilbit, he's the kind of person who is hard to read, because he does not show emotions or any kind of facial expressions towards his friends and his family. After a dramatic incident that happened to him 10 years ago caused him to close his heart to anyone, he is just a go with the flow kind of guy. He's not your typical perverted, supersmart, heartthrob, weird, narcissist, clumsy, dumb, cringy, loud, oblivious, masochistic kind of MC in short he is just a hardworking, a handy man, silent and a normally matured kid just like some of us in the real world, realistically speaking. Some girls in real life actually prefers guys like these one, hard to read and hard to get and pretty mysterious and sometimes unexpectedly sweet! He reminds me of my younger self until i met my wife actually, she change my life, turned me around a full 180. That's why i have some kind of connection from this.\\n\\n\r\nHe was that kind of person until He met Teresa! Because of her, Tada-kun slowly changed, even his club mates, friends and family were all shocked because of his development throughout the series. But he does not realize his own feelings yet. Its up to you to find out more.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is Amazing! I love how colorful it was, designs and backgrounds are good, i hope this will get english dubbed so i could enjoy the art style more with the story. 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: is just okay and sweet. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Some characters, aside from the two leads, are quite interesting. HINA, PIN, and ALEC caught my attention. I wish there was a separate arc just for them, i would love to see how their love story unfold. If they include that i bet this would be one of the best there is. But sadly we are left hanging, but it's okay they were not the main focus. If there is a second season just for them i would be overjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: did i or did i not enjoy this? Ofcourse yes! I did enjoy watching it, and I would watch it over again. Btw, I wont tell you what type of ending it has because it's somekind of a spoiler if i do. I want you to enjoy it too. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: its been sweet, kinda reminds me of my own love story in some way. I give it 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nAnd oh btw! If you like this anime, you're in for a treat because it has some similarities, just a little bit, the anime is called Ano Natsu De Matteru (Waiting In The Summer) it's a good anime you guys should also check and i highly recommend it. \\n\\n\r\nSayonara! Arigatou Guzaimasu!",

            "content": "Tada-kun is like that store bought bagel for breakfast with barely not enough cream cheese (sorry, if you don't get the idea. But, stay with me). The first couple of bites are delightfully sweet and savory. It makes you feel like you're being over satisfied with your decision to grab this bagel. However, after finishing one side, and taking the bite of the 2nd half you realize, there's nothing new to experience. The taste in your mouth is no longer of delight, but middling satisfaction. And, that experience is the essence of what Tada-kun during my runthrough of it.\r\nThe opening episodes were a whirlwind ofcomedic poise and interesting character chemistries. I wanted to know more about every character, especially Alec. I understood that each character was created with a VERY FIRM caricature of stereotypes, but I believed the screenwriters could mold them into something dynamic. Tada-kun seemed like the generic despondent MC (similar to Decim from Death Parade) whose nature would slowly develop from being around an energetic foil (Teresa). Every other character had their own pairings to develop chemistry with and bring their own unique personalities to form a fun group to be around.\\n\\n\r\nBUT NO.\\n\\n\r\nTHAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.\\n\\n\r\nTada-kun after episode 5 this anime becomes the 2nd half of the bagel. It slows down into a snails pace of a romantic-comedy that doesn't really understand its own potential. It focuses too much on the idea of trying to create this forced narrative between Tada and Teresa that pays little homage to other potential romances like Sugimoto and Hasegawa or Alec and Charles (even though it seems written on the wall.)\\n\\n\r\nIt keeps petering along with the Slice of Life aspects making all the romance come to a halt to allow for its comedy bits to shine. While I didn't find those shorts skits funny, I did find them to be enjoyable fluff. \\n\\n\r\nI do share various sentiments with other reviews of this anime being invariably disappointed with how this show turned out. But, that doesn't mean I think it should be rated lower than a 6.\\n\\n\r\nIt's an above-average anime that was only helped with Wotakoi airing at the same time. I don't hope for a second season because the ending that was given to us was fairly closed-ended, unless Doga Kobo decides to go forward with less Slice of Life and more Romantic progression.",

            "content": "Tada never falls in Love has one of the satisfying endings that reminds me of when i was watching Toradora. A new original anime done by Dogakobo, a studio well known for making comedic anime such as Yuru Yuri and Umaru chan. \r\nThe anime has it's typical rom-com elements that of-course to give entertainment to the viewers, however it also explore the main character's background on his mundane/chill/suppressed feelings attitude as the same of the main heroine's story albeit was only exposed in the remaining few episodes. \r\nI also love the character developments among his circle and the heroine itself, leading to goal on whatthe series is achieving for, and the tense whether it will be a happy ending or not. However i was not satisfied on them not focusing the other characters background but i understand the reason for it since this was an original anime groundwork. Nevertheless with the poor and rushed plot line due to episode limitation, i still somehow enjoy the series thanks to its character development and comedic elements.\\n\\n\r\nI would watch the last 4 minutes of the final episode part lot because it's just satisfying to see how they character shifted from \"Never falls in love\" to become \"Falls in love\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyed the OST and love the tempo they had, also liken the OP and ED song which perfectly distinguish happy and sad feelings. I love the character designs as it reminds me of Gekkan Shoujo anime and their detailing works on buildings and the night starry sky, suitable for taking pictures.\\n\\n\r\nWith that, an overall of 7/10 is the score i will gave to this decent rom-com anime. Recommended to watch? Yes if you are on the feel on watching something new or just want to fill up your free time. However if you want a more decent rom-com with well executed and unrushed plot lines, there are other great show that you can watch than this.",

Just want to know if you should watch it? I've got you covered.\r\nTada-kun is a solid romance anime entry with good pacing and just enough drama to keep you hooked to the end. Nothing ground breaking, but it is a solid choice when looking for a new romance anime.\r\nThankfully a good amount of this show takes place outside of a school setting, which is a nice change from your usual slice of life romance thattakes place with school-age characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC's aren't too-heavily leaning on any major character traits. The story is fairly simple and anyone with even moderate experience watching romance/slice of life anime will recognize where it is headed within the first few episodes. But there is a nice side story involving the MC's family and some surprise history that reveals itself eventually that was a nice breath of fresh air to the traditional story.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is also complete and mostly happy, which always adds a point to my review score.\\n\\n\r\nHIGHLIGHTS: Animation, story, simple characters with no totally-insane character traits, non-Japanese female MC.\\n\\n\r\nDISAPPOINTMENTS: Fairly standard story for the most part, nothing totally ground-breaking in terms of characters or story-line beyond a few surprises, music wasn't anything to write home about.",

            "content": "Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai: A good anime that started 10 episodes later\r\nTada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai could have generated a huge impact; however, bad decisions condemned it to end up as another romantic series.\r\nAnd although I said \"bad decisions\" in the plural, in reality it was only one that generated the avalanche. Which? To have put the plot in motion ten episodes after the beginning of the series.\r\nSure, surely many will say that that does not have to be a blunder, because depending on the duration of the anime there could be enough space to work; however, when the series barely lasts 13 episodes,there is not much room for adjustments. By the way, some spoilers are coming, although I will try not to tell many.\\n\\n\r\nI said in my first impressions that my biggest concern was that the series at the beginning seemed to focus strictly on being a slice of life with strong touches of comedy; however, its setting shouted that a great drama in the story would eventually have to come.\\n\\n\r\nThis implied that the handling of the rhythm was going to be fundamental, because the transition from one end to the other is not something that is easily achieved. Do not forget that the difference in status between Tada and Teresa had to take center stage at some point, of course, considering that the series followed the path of romance with classic drama.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, with the passing of the episodes I must admit that each time I understood less the intentions of the creators of the series. What was your goal with this anime? Slice of life, comedy, light romance, drama? Each new episode focused on casual situations and developed little and nothing of the 4 couples that had shown up at the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, paradoxically, Tada and Teresa, main protagonists of the anime, were those who had the least development as a couple and even as characters. Instead, the focus seemed to be directed towards Kaoru and Alec, Hajime and Hinako and even Gentarou and Yui. However, there was not much progress on those fronts either.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if the above had not covered enough time, the series introduces Charles, but instead of giving weight to his role as the third vertex of an impending love triangle formed by him, Tada and Teresa (the blonde is the official fianc\u00e9 of the Princess); he focuses more on his relationship with Alec, expanding the geometric figure to a square.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's more, the whole of Charles's arc focuses on the feelings that Alec has towards him, with some moments of Tada and Teresa that do not get to majors. And we can not forget that 8 episodes of the series have already elapsed by the end of the arc.\\n\\n\r\nMany times, the defenders of slow or late romances give as a great argument that in this way feelings can be developed progressively, reasonably and credibly; however, this is something that falls under its own weight.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many examples of fast-established couples who have a great development in their relationship. Kotarou and Akane from Tsuki ga Kirei, Narumi and Hirotaka from Wotakoi or Qin Yun and Yi Xiao from the Chinese cultivation novel Seeking the Flying Sword Path are clear examples of this. On the other hand, Ichigo and Orihime or Rukia and Renji of Bleach are examples of the opposite. Couples who took hundreds of chapters (literally) to establish themselves, but in spite of that, their union felt totally forced.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, the speed or time a couple establishes does not necessarily denote a good development of romance; and it is here that a bad decision regarding rhythm prevented Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai from developing its full potential.\\n\\n\r\nIt was not until episode 10, when Teresa decides to return untimely to her native country, when the gears were finally set in motion. And oh boy that from there the series showed that it was able to give us magical and powerful moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole process lived by Tada, his trip to Larsenburg to look for Teresa, all that his presence there originated in the blonde, Charles and Alec; The way in which the outcome was prepared and the end in itself were handled in very good shape. However, it never stopped feeling rushed and it was impossible to wonder why this drama had not started before and so develop it to the rhythm that corresponded. Especially, considering that all the time spent in the other three couples did not end up bearing fruit because in the end nothing was achieved in any of the cases. In fact, in the secondary pairs, it was not even reached a point where the relationship was indirectly confirmed. If in the end they were going to leave all those unfinished plots, why dedicate so much space to them?\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, the couple of Charles and Alec could have developed much more, but the short time that was at the end of the series barely gave to show brushstrokes. And that is precisely why you can not stop thinking that this series was for much more; however, the approach was totally wrong for too long.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the technical section. The character design was not bad, the animation had a good level, the soundtrack was too generic; and the direction will carry forever the weight of having condemned Tada-kun wa Koi or Shinai to be a series that in a few weeks will have fallen into oblivion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nThis series may have left its mark, but unfortunately it will end up being seen as one more series among many that exist in the genre.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The plot is a bit of a bummer as we get a clich\u00e9 at the end but before it it\u2019s pretty original.  The ending left a lot of things vague and I wish they could\u2019ve taken out one of the fillers and replaced it with an episode that gave us a more detailed ending.  This leads me to the next topic, there are fillers.  Sure they make you laugh and are actually pretty enjoyable but they are still fillers.  They have almost nothing to do withthe plot and are only there to waste episodes.  The characters are very interesting to stay the least.  They all are polar opposites if there were enough poles for all of them but together they truly know what being a friend is about.  Overall I really enjoyed this anime.  I cannot guarantee that everyone will enjoy it but I know that it was a very fun few hours watching this anime.  Give it a shot if you\u2019re up for a fun watch that may make you feel just a little warm inside.  And then crush you when you realize you have to watch anime to make you feel good since there\u2019s no one for you in real life.  *cry*. But actually give this anime a try you shouldn\u2019t be disappointed if you know that it\u2019s not a hardcore romance.  Just a normal highschool romance with a twist.",

The charactersfelt cheerful and the whole anime gave you a cheerful vibe, now this vibe was obviously continued in the rest of the anime but the differing point is that it was cliched to the extreme. Don't get me wrong, cliches aren't bad, but they have to be handled properly to make the show watchable and not lazily copy over cliches and skin them with your colour and post it as your anime, this is unfortunately what Tada-kun continued to do and it certainly was heartbreaking for me to see that the show I loved in episode one became a cliche machine by the 5th episode (and I'm talking about myself here, others may have started seeing effects way earlier than me). \\n\\n\r\nBeing a Slice of Life meant that a concrete plot wasn't exactly on the list of priorities for any anime studio for that matter, so it comes by no surprise that this show as well didn't have one, and since this is very normal and common with most Slice of Life shows in general, I'll make this the one step I'll forgive. But what comes is the rest. One problem only, cliches. Each episode was filled to the brim with cliches, be it a situation, a backstory (not Tada\u2019s), the characters, and unfortunately, the romance. \\n\\n\r\nA cliched romance isn't exactly something I'll throw over to the Lions for, but when it's not even trying to add a dash of originality things start to get messy. I mostly went \u201cOh so in the next episode preview this is going to happen? Then this cliche will be followed\u201d and it killed my enjoyment in the anime as compared to the first episode. And this isn't a hot springs episode thing, sudden bumps, blushes at the same words, a situation being ruined by the characters\u2019 actions, are all examples of cliches that the show followed (forgive me for being vague, as of the time of writing I've been watching a lot of anime this season so my memory is slightly hazy). \u201cWhy is this guy focusing so much on the cliches?\u201d you might be asking. To me, cliches were the one biggest problem the show had, if this was fixed, I doubt the show would disappoint me, but then again, improving cliches is very much easier said than done. And fixing them is important because to keep a Slice of Life fun, especially a romance, you need fresh ideas, Tada had none of that.\\n\\n\r\nTada-kun\u2019s characters weren't the most unique of ones but I'll have to give credit, they were cheerful but their personalities were once again riddled by the C word (pretty sure you're as tired of reading it as I am writing it, but then again, this was the biggest problem of the show anyway). Although fans were gleefully picking out the ships right from the first episode going \u201cAlec x Ijuuin\u201d and the like it kinda felt a bit boring. I mean, not trying to act nitpicky but a little bit of a surprise is always welcome in a romance isn't it? \u201cNo\u201d according to this anime. Although not having a surprise isn't 100% bad per se but yet again, Tada-kun didn't try to make it work. At best this can remind me that the show felt lazy. Doga Kobo tried to make something fun but a little different but didn't want to make the effort for it and got itself trapped within its own plans. Apart from the cat, every single romance in the show was horribly implemented. Tada X Teresa has got to be one of the most irritating romances I've ever seen because both of them acted so stupidly and their shyness for normal things like talking to each other (especially when they first met) has got to be a pathetic way to go about the \u201cfalling in love\u201d step of romances. I mean, I despise the \u201clove at first sight\u201d view and Tada didn't help make it better at all. Pin-head and Representative-san\u2019s romance as well wasn't explored and was left shallow. But then again it in itself was shallow from the start. Him not knowing that his childhood friend is the idol he idolises so much? Could you be any more cliche? Before you answer that, Tada already did. Yamashita Dog and Tada\u2019s sister as well were just a one blush game as well. Coming back to Tada, his \u201cromance\u201d with Teresa was random, pretty much non-existent except for the last 3 episodes maybe if you don't count stupid \u201cOh I saw you look at me and I don't know what to say\u201d crap as \u201clove\u201d... I'm not saying shy romances are bad, but Tada and Teresa made them look pathetic with their random shyness. Sometimes they're super shy and the other second they're pretty much flirting?\\n\\n\r\nPeople went memeing around saying that the cats had the best romance but funnily enough that turned out to be very much true, until *that* happened. On the other hand the other romances felt average and not out of the box. At many times I found myself predicting what the next situation could be for the characters and when and how the blushes would happen. Perhaps the one romance I could like was of Ijuuin and our secretary Tsundere, Alec (since it is of a cliche I could say I don't have a problem with). The rest meanwhile, were\u2026 average like I said. It seemed as if the writers wanted to do something different, they wanted to try to make the show enjoyable in episode one, but the sad contrast in the later episode showed that they were the teenager who after getting bad grades thinks \u201cI'm going to work hard from tomorrow onwards\u201d and right the next day get caught in their usual routine, without any thought or apology for not doing what they promised themselves they'd do.\\n\\n\r\nNow, this show isn't filth, far from it, it's not FranXX, but it's average, it's mediocre. Why? It doesn't ruin everything and burn everything to the ground. It is still an anime you could watch in small increments (perhaps once a week to you binge watchers who are going to watch the show after it airs). It's still an anime that can leave most with a normal face, since it's charm is still present, only drastically reduced from what it could have been, perhaps a mere shadow of itself. Is Tada-kun the show I like to call \u201cwasted potential\u201d? Definitely. Although it didn't go it's own way it didn't veer off into the abyss either, therefore putting it in the middle. What wasn't in the middle would be the artstyle, which I've iterated thrice here was cheerful, bright and very much like Doga Kobo. Apart from reminding me about Gekkan Shoujo, it made it's characters look cute and attractive. Be it Hinako, Teresa or Tada-kun himself, everyone looked cute, and that's not to say about the colourful backgrounds and eye-catching scenery either, those were fabulous and my favourite part about the anime. But then again, cute characters and a great artstyle don't make for a good romance.\\n\\n\r\nNow something that was almost decent was the voice acting. Although it felt bad in terms of the female voice actors the male actors made up for it. I can forgive the female voice acting only on the grounds that Alec and Teresa\u2019s voice actors aren't as experienced in the field as the males were (but I must admit, Teresa\u2019s high pitched voice was VERY IRRITATING) and to be honest, apart from these two, on the male side I found Ijuuin a bit irritating with his voice, I was absolutely shocked to discover that Miyano Mamoru voiced him as a result. But in the end it boils down to how much you enjoyed the show. I for one don't hate the show (NANI), it's just that I felt let down because again, I wanted the show to continue the direction it had in episode one, if it did, it would be an 8 today or maybe even a 9. But not everything goes your way. \\n\\n\r\nThere's always that one show that clearly shows the idea the writers had in mind in the beginning but lazy writing can turn the best of starts into an average okay-ish show AT BEST, and it's sad to say but, Tada-kun stays as an example of that. I do hope that we see some improvement in Doga Kobo\u2019s next show, but as of now, I doubt a sequel to this show could carve out something better like Nozaki-kun, although I'd love to be proven wrong. Amaze me Doga Kobo.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nAnimation: 7\\n\r\nSound: 5.5\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.1",

            "content": "'Tada-kun Never Falls in Love' is a series I started watching just to know if this is actually true. Turns out the series stays loyal to its name for approximately 56 seconds. Simply amazing.\r\nThe idea is rather fresh for a romance series. Our main characters are a Japanese boy and an European exchange student who is currently living in Japan. One has to wonder how on earth on this day and age has this not been done before. Pretty much everyone knows at least 10 people IRL who have studied abroad via exchange studen programs. After getting a general idea of the premise, I wassure I would like this series. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to our main characters, Tada is bit from the generic school boy side, but appears mature and highly certain about himself in the self-centered lone wolf type of way. His whole existence appears almost businesslike. Teresa on the other hand is very open and genuine person who has the tendency of seeing beauty in pretty much everything. A bit of 2pure4this world is radiating from her during scenes where she, for example, happily plays with a cat in the rain. I also get a heart-attack whenever there is a close-up of her emerald eyes shown on screen. These two people appear to be more similar than they personality-wise seem. Pretty cool. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, that's pretty much where the good things end. My biggest problem with this series are the side-characters who do not have in anyway believable personalities. Most of them come off as purely comedic devices rather than actual characters. It's pretty annoying and unnecessary. I am not sure if I prefer this over generic drama and love-triangles or not. That's how bad it is. The voice acting for these characters is so inferior compared to the main voice acting that is immersion-breaking and reminds me that I am indeed watching an anime. And now it is not even a romance anime anymore: It's a slice of life comedy, and most of the time not even very funny. Excluding the cats who are real MVP's. Overall, this would have been So. Much. Better. as a serious series. After the quite original and interesting settings, rest of the series is filled with generic content, typical cliches and cop-out writing. I am not very impressed..",

            "content": "Sometimes I find joy in the simplest of things.\r\nTada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai is definitely one of those. At first glance unoriginal, generic romantic comedy with nothing memorable about it. However, idea and execution are two different terms. And, in case of Tada-kun, it counts twice as much.\r\nI can imagine that looking at Tada-kun's anime page doesn't strike interest in many people, and respectably so. Nothing about its story, characters or even stylization seem particulalry original. And that feeling doesn't change even at the end of the show, especially story-wise.\r\nThe story is what you would possibly expect a rom/com to be. A random meeting thatstarts off everything, transfer students, school club, trips, little sister, side-kick comedy friend, weird drama, multiple couples, cat. Tada-kun's story is really full of clich\u00e9s, overused plot elements and weird dramatic moments. However, although it has a lot of flaws, it's also needful to say that everything works kinda well together. In other words, even if I have to criticize Tada-kun's story for its genericity, It's not true that it is necessarily a bad story by itself, at least at the beginning. Events, characters are part of, collaborate with each other. Plot-continuity is also done better than in most rom/coms and the order in which certain events happen doesn't feel randomly put together but follows up development of character relations. However, what I have to say that while the story tries to become more serious as the time goes on, everything worked better when it was more light-themed, hence the first half of the show remains the best one, and things fall off a bit after that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters themselves are an area in which Tada-kun surprised me the most. Especially when it comes to the main couple. Tada, our main hero, is one of the better romance characters I've had the pleasure of seeing. That is not to say that he's special, super-complex or incredibly interesting to watch. No, what makes him so good is because he's realistic and believable. Frankly, there has probably never been a main character I could so strongly relate to. He is not laughing very much and doesn't look the happiest, yet he is not doing because he just \"wants to look cool\" (which is the case especially in most of shoujo romances), that is literally what his inner expressions are. He's obsessed his photographing, doesn't talk all that much, doesn't want to do things he finds embarrassing and regrets his past mistakes like all people do. I don't even think he lacks common sense or anything of the sorts. I know it sounds really crazy, but believe me, romance protagonists can have a personality! (even if it's a pretty boring personality technically speaking) Overall, he is a good character. Not flashy, not loud, not perfect. Just pure and believable.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is, of course, Teresa, the main heroine of the story. Her case is slightly different than Tada is. She's more active, very sweet and sometimes a little weird. What I love is how well she matches up Tada in their duo. While he is the thoughtful, quieter one, she's the one who often invites him to do stuff and her activity starts to reflect on him as the series goes along. She also understands her position in their world very well, as in one moment she decides to abandon her feeling because they seriously have no chance of becoming true and they would only make her feel worse. Her and Tada's relationship growth was also done in a respectful manner. While it was clear that the fire between them got lit in their first meeting, the show does a good job at developing and justifying their emotions with romantic moments spread throughout. And it is very clear that they fall for each other more and more and the show goes on.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the other characters are also worth talking about. As first, we have Ijuuin. He seems like the classic case of the side-kick friends which only purpose is making gags. Which is not only partially false, because he has a position in the story and his own romantic interest, but also doesn't even matter much, because his comedy actually works. I never even liked this type of heavy gag characters, yet his jokes are just spot on a lot of the time. I seriously didn't imagine that I would laugh so much during every episode, but Ijuuin made it that way. And I love him because of that. There is also Alec, Teresa's transfer mate, and subordinate. Hinako and Hajime, who sadly never got to solve the relationship between them presented in the first episodes. And Charles, probably the nicest guy ever.\\n\\n\r\nThere is really a lot to talk about all of them because Tada-kun is a heavily character driven show. One could say that some of them are just following certain personality archetypes, which I don't think is even true. An example; while Alec could be considered a bit of a Tsundere when interacting with a certain character, she acts completely different in front of someone else. That in itself means there is more to her than just one-way personality and that she isn't just blindly following the possibilities her \"archetype\" allows her to. Same could be said about all the other characters, which to me justifies that they are more than just dummies without a brain.\\n\\n\r\nI think it's pretty certain at this point that I really enjoyed watching Tada-kun. Yes, it could be considered generic, it could be considered unoriginal. Yet, the execution the anime comes with is good and I generally decided to not really care. Just to clarify, it's true that it becomes slightly messier as time goes on and the first episodes are ultimately the best show has, on the other hand, I wouldn't consider the latter half to be as bad as people make. Mainly because while the story overall stagnates, the very good characters are able to carry the show by themselves.\\n\\n\r\nArt was decent. Character designs don't look particularly memorable, yet they're at least nice to look at. The same can be said about the background and the animation itself. Everything is good, just forgettable. They maybe could've played around with the color palette a bit more. The sound was good. I think the voice actors, in particular, did a really good job and especially Ijuuin's was just seriously hilarious. OST did have some nice tracks though once again didn't come off as particularly interesting by itself.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-------\\n\\n\r\nSecond best comedy of the year after last season's Yuru Camp and an anime of the season for me in terms of expectation/result equation. Considering it's generic setup and decent, but not impressive, production values, Tada-kun really is as good of an anime as it could've been. And even if that probably doesn't mean much in the long run, it's enough for me to appreciate it now.",

            "content": "Tada Never Falls in Love is like a colorful bouquet of plastic flowers. From a distance, you might mistake it for the real thing. But upon closer inspection, you\u2019ll find it's merely a lifeless imitation. Factory produced from the most generic mold, identical to its fellow flowers rolling off the conveyor belt alongside it. \r\nUndeniably crafted with talent, Tadakoi offers refined background art and detailed character animation in place of quality writing. While the show had potential to be good with its solid audiovisuals, they are entirely wasted on generic characters and a poorly written story. \r\nThe story follows the titular Mitsuyoshi Tada, an uncharismaticphotographer who\u2019s tough past has prevented him from ever knowing love. Through a chance encounter, he meets an enthusiastic foreigner, Teresa. She acts overly excited, running around trying to hop fences and expressing a crazy amount of interest in a Samurai TV series, which seems to have given her some wrong impressions about Japan. All of it is played to comedic effect, it\u2019s fun and lighthearted enough in spite of being unrealistic, with her voice actress' upbeat performance to sell her personality well.\\n\\n\r\nThen, through another chance encounter, she ends up being stuck in the rain protecting a stray cat and getting splashed from all directions by water like the universe is punishing her for being nice. But to her rescue comes the lethargic Tada with an umbrella and an invitation to go to his family-owned cafe. Teresa compares what she believes is Tada\u2019s heroism to the samurai she idolizes in her favorite show, and that\u2019s how she falls in love. The cafe itself is lushly ornamented and has warm lighting to contrast the gray rainstorm, a cozy atmosphere for sure. She meets his family, has a meal, changes into dry clothes, thanks Tada, then heads home to the house she just moved into\u2026 which happens to be right next door. \\n\\n\r\nTada and Teresa\u2019s relationship feels contrived and hard to believe from the moment they first meet. An unbelievable amount of plot conveniences bring them together, it feels less like their relationship develops organically and more a writer forces them together. The show attempts to play off the cliched intro as a joke, but it\u2019s still lazy writing no matter how much you laugh about it. Aside from these contrivances, they leads don\u2019t have much chemistry with one another for the vast majority of the show. \\n\\n\r\nOften times it feels as though Tada\u2019s writing bends over backward in order to Fall in Love; his character and the relationship he has with Teresa never feel believable enough to be the foundation for the series. He\u2019s unrealistically oblivious to Teresa\u2019s pining over him, that is until the plot decides it\u2019s the right time for them to finally acknowledge their feelings. It\u2019s contrived for the sake of creating a compelling resolution, but in doing so it makes Tada difficult to look at as anything but a plot device for most of the show. There is no analysis of his personality that wouldn\u2019t lead to frustration, obliviousness for the sake of stalling the story is lazy writing and does not make good characters. Occasionally the show lampshades his emotional unawareness with the fact that his parents were killed in a car crash when he was younger, but we never see him from a personal enough perspective to understand why he became closed off or to what degree it affects him in the present. Why does it feel like these days more and more anime mistake emotionally-damaged characters for brain-damaged ones?\\n\\n\r\nIn one of the show\u2019s best and funniest episodes, narrated by Tada\u2019s cat Nyanko Big (a far more interesting character), the two protagonists share a sensitive moment that seemed on the surface like something out of a much better series. However, this is Tada-kun we\u2019re dealing with so there's practically no introspection; when Teresa catches Nyanko Big from a tree and falls back onto Tada only for him to catch her, it's an excellent timed moment of silence between the two yet it has almost no impact. While that moment showcases the very understated burgeoning love Teresa has for Tada, it never feels like a mutual romance. When they make eye contact in a seemingly mutually tender moment there is no sign anything is on Tada\u2019s mind. He\u2019s totally vacant. There\u2019s never a hint he might be in love outside of these moments where he might blush a little and only to return to normal moments later, unphased. Any potential for development is squashed, there is no satisfying growth for him. When the ending inevitably has to wrap up the story in a \u2018satisfying\u2019 way, his character arc takes a jarringly rapid change to compensate for the missing development. Leaving both him and the finale feeling underserved and artificial. \\n\\n\r\nAt least Teresa\u2019s feelings for Tada feel somewhat genuine. Lasting effects of their understated flirtations are seen in Teresa throughout the show. Her feelings develop more and more until she has to face them in a somewhat compelling resolution. Sadly, any potentially remarkable scenes that Teresa has get entirely snuffed out by Tada\u2019s dull idiocy, but they\u2019re also somewhat helped by the interesting visual language. Through subtle visual storytelling techniques we learn that she\u2019s pining for him from the start; over the course of the show we see brief moments of her lost in thought looking at him with starry eyes. It\u2019s not one-dimensional drama like Tada\u2019s; she gets enough scenes describing her life situation for us to know that she is constantly considering the arranged marriage she\u2019s in and how it ensures that she could never have a relationship with Tada. Her dilemma is miles more compelling than anything else the series offers emotionally, but that\u2019s thanks to the strong directing rather than the writing. \\n\\n\r\nPlenty of care has been put into the visuals. There\u2019s no shortage of small but purposeful details added to the settings the cast inhabit; homes lined with photos of memories from previous episodes or ones that refer to their backstories. Is it enough to outweigh the mediocre characterization? No, not by a long shot, but at least it\u2019s something to keep you engaged with it and tells you that the director cared about their craft. Where the visuals are more effective is the comedy. With the director of Monthly Girl\u2019s Nozaki-kun, it\u2019s clear to see why the comedy here is so strong; jokes are well timed and there\u2019s so much character animation to telegraph a joke and convey the cast\u2019s personalities. Of course, when jokes are derived from the bland characters they almost always fall flat. \\n\\n\r\nWhere the majority of my gripes come in is the side characters. This is a rom-com after all, so there is quite a few of them. None of them make up for what the protagonists lack, a few even bring the whole show down. Most of them are incredibly generic one-note cardboard cutouts, the ones that do receive development are somehow made even worse with insufferable episodes dedicated to telling us the boring story of characters that I can\u2019t imagine anyone would care about. There\u2019s Teresa\u2019s friend/servant who traveled with her to Japan, Alec. Her whole character is just the tough girl who is overprotective of Teresa because a few shallow reasons told to us through a backstory. She often beats up the clown of the group, generic clown kid who\u2019s name I literally can\u2019t remember. His only purpose was comic relief, and his animation was the most detailed of the group to showcase his comedic personality, but in truth, everything about him felt so cringy with an overdone voice performance to add even more annoyance. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few others who hang around the group like Tada\u2019s sister and occasionally the prince engaged to Teresa. I somewhat appreciated how Teresa\u2019s suitor wasn\u2019t portrayed as an evil threat like many tropey arranged marriage stories do, but instead as a nice guy who respects her wishes. However, his passivity also leads him to have no impact in the story. He\u2019s surprisingly forgettable for one of the more unusual archetypes, but the show wastes all of his on-screen presence, leaving him a bland cipher like the rest of the recurring cast. \\n\\n\r\nHajime, or more commonly known as Pin-senpai is undoubtedly the worst part of the show by a wide margin. Introduced by him creepily ogling the female cast to ascertain their breast sizes, defusing the saccharine factor this series was going for whenever he appears on-screen. He\u2019s constantly yelling, so much yelling with such an irritating voice. He is never content with just fading into the background while on-screen with everyone else, he has to scream as loudly as possible whenever he speaks. Having an obnoxious character like Pin is fine for a comedy series of this type; but what he screams about, no, what his whole character is about, is so pointless and weird, sometimes downright creepy. He adores a model, Hina, to an absurd degree because he loves big boobs\u2026 You can have a perverted character, that\u2019s fine, but he is over exaggerated to an obnoxious and unbelievable degree. None of his jokes are ever funny unless its other characters making fun of him; like how they used Hina merchandise to trick him into losing their photography club game. \\n\\n\r\nPin\u2019s character arc seemed little more than an excuse for him to seem less like an annoying walking cliche, and it fell flat. Sadly, the show gives him an entire episode meant to show he had some kind of compassion. His character had potential, with his childhood friend Hinako (notice the name??) who is so very clearly the model from the moment she\u2019s introduced right next to the pinup poster. Throughout the show, there's plenty of hints to indicate she's in love with him, despite him not realizing the model he ogles ever day is actually his friend. Hinako looks the exact same as she does in her bikini shoots, except that she wears glasses. It's such a stupid conflict that the show lampshades the lazy writing by having Alec point out that it's obvious. This stupid conflict damages the believability of both Pin and Hinako because other than the cookie-cutter personalities they have nothing else to prove their unlikable stories aren't all there is to them. \\n\\n\r\nTheir relationship arc literally culminates in Hinako disappointed at how Pinhead never realized she was the model all along, but she\u2019s happy that he at least likes her idol personality and her boobs. Wow, great themes Tadakoi. Their episode is the most boring because of how one-dimensional the situation and characters are, but also one of the most distasteful ones. I guess you could say Hinako technically had character development, she discovered her fetish for cucking herself. Amazing. But Pinhead still has no redeeming value even after we\u2019re forced to sit through his \u2018development\u2019 episode. Screw that guy.\\n\\n\r\nBarely anything happens in Tadakoi until the final few episodes, that's when it finally decides there needs to be some kind of progress made before the end. Regardless of the artificial developments made by the end, it's always predictable; right from episode one, you can guess how the story will play out. Perhaps with more interesting characters, it could have been watchable in spite of these flaws, but instead, it's just aggressively bland. No amount of lush sceneries and trained directing could save dull, lazy writing. At least the opening song is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nTadakoi is the variety of mediocrity that will pass through the anime community with no impact, then inevitably be forgotten forever. You might get something out of it if you\u2019re a fan of the director or if you're new to anime. Otherwise, I suggest you skip this generic fluff.",

            "content": "The only thing I can say is, this show gives you the same content that you saw before on other shows about romcom. And you know what kind plot it has. The only thing that makes this show enjoyable is how the story progress. It doesn't matter if it has the same formula for the beginning and the ending atleast it manage to connect those parts and don't make the story kind of mess up.\r\nArt Style, I don't know why I have to explain it. Everything I watch has the same style unless its 3D,2.5D or CGI then I guess I can give an opinionabout that. But if you are going to say, \"How about the pictures? Aren't they good?\" Yes, yes they are. But nothing is different. A picture within a picture, what's the difference?\\n\\n\r\nSame to Sound/Music, unless Music itself was the topic of the show. For Voice Acting? Nothing aswell. Unless they try to speak English which is funny but nothing more. I'm not hating how they speak it, I just mentioning it because I had nothing to mention about the Sound/Music.\\n\\n\r\nFor the Characthers, well, they also similar to others but atleast they pick the good ones. And if you observe, all characters in this show can be equally devided as partners. So good news for Shippers, I guess... But nonetheless, the Main Characters are fun to watch together. The English title of this show tells our Male Protagonist, Tada-kun never falls in love, and of course, it wasn't true at all. Thats why it has a Romance Tag.\\n\\n\r\nDo I enjoy watching this? Yes, yes I do. I don't care if it has a overused plot or a terrible presentation (For your prespective). I like watching this kind of shows and you might think now that starting from the beginning I was biased  but I keep it equal as possible. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, its good show, and if you think its overused plot shouldn't be given a chance, I feel so sorry for you. It doesn't matter if its overused. The thing that matters how its presented,how it showed and how it progress. I rather have the same meal for years than to starve to death. What I was pointing out is, overused doesn't mean terrible or bad. But regardless, this show surely isn't bad, the score already says it all. I wonder why. It has the same plot as the last anime I just give a review about yet they are given different treatment, sigh.",

            "content": "What ingredients really make up a good rom-com show these days? I\u2019m not going to lie, I have high expectations when a creator wants to make a show with romance themes. As an original anime, Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai (Tada Never Falls in Love) seems to be a show that would entice me with its premise. Unfortunately, it dropped the ball as each episode passed on and eventually reached the point of being broken.\r\nOriginal anime like this doesn\u2019t fall into the trap of a weak adaptation. It has no material to follow after all. The story involves Mituyoshi Tada as he meets a foreignernamed Teresa Wagner during her trip to Japan. As a rom-com, you should definitely expect love to develop between the pair, right? Well, that would be the case if Tada actually understands it. To be fair, love is a complicated subject but for Tada, he treats it indifferently. There\u2019s undeniable chemistry between the two yet the show seems to rarely make a connection between them. However, the first few episodes did draw a big curiosity out of me. Teresa brings in a lot of her own personality and interest into the show as well. The idea of a Western foreigner coming to Japan has a lot of potential. Even from the first few episodes, she shows a lot of curiosity about Japan. It\u2019s also shown that she is an avid fan of Rainbow Shougun, a fictional TV drama with samurai themes. My impression of her from early episodes is that she is a bit airheaded but kind to just about everyone. This is a contrast to Alec Magritte, Teresa\u2019s caretaker who seems to be intensely protective of her friend. Unlike Teresa, she is blunt and often takes aggressive moves to protect her. That doesn\u2019t mean she is a cruel person though. Alec is mainly close to Teresa because of her past and isn\u2019t as easy to make friends with. She often gets into oddball moments with Kaoru because of his flirtatious personality and attempts to hit on her.\\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019ve probably noticed by now but the show has a small character cast. The majority of the characters you meet in the first episode are the ones you\u2019ll get to know for rest of the season. This also includes Tada\u2019s classmates such a Hajime Sugimoto from the Photography club and class president Hinako Hasegawa. The show does also make time to give these two a spotlight in early episodes although it\u2019s more of a tease than anything else. To me, it\u2019s goofy and funny although also unoriginal. The idea of a girl living a double life with a love interest being oblivious isn\u2019t new in rom-coms. There\u2019s not much uniqueness to either Hajime or Hinako in terms of character development. They also fall into the character archetype that you can find in any series that takes place at school. Even more questionable is a character named Kentarou Yamashita who enters the show as a comic relief. There\u2019s a comical reason why he\u2019s nicknamed Yamashita Dog with his behavior. The character chemistry he shares with Yui Tada (Mitsuyoshi\u2019s sister) is pretty forgettable honestly. That\u2019s actually a big part that holds the show back from achieving success. It feels like as each episode passes on, the characters become less and less intriguing. Teresa and Tada gets sidetracked as the show tests the viewers\u2019 patience. I say this with an open mind because I want to love them. Even for characters like Charles de Loire, I wanted him to be more engaging in the show besides just being a guy with French nobility. His role as a fianc\u00e9 to Teresa originally gave me the feeling that he may be a love rival to Tada. Unfortunately, this series doesn\u2019t really capitalize no bringing much romantic drama. Tada is often too stoic and thinks straightforward without much emotion to bring much interest. Teresa is too energetic that contrasts with both characters\u2019 personalities. When you mix these ingredients together, the end product isn\u2019t appealing.\\n\\n\r\nWell, you\u2019re probably thinking if any character in the show is worth paying attention to overall. Thankfully, there is and it\u2019s not even a human. Nyanko Big is a stray cat that Tada found and adopted a decade ago. The furball has a lot of human personality and one episode even focuses on his little cat adventure. This anime needed episodes like this to bring out a more refreshing style of storytelling. Because let\u2019s face it, a majority of the episodes feels the same. I can\u2019t say this without shaking my head honestly because I really expected more from the writer involved. Yoshiki Nakamura previously worked on Skip Beat and that bought out a refreshing outlook on the rom-com genre. What does Tada-kun bring out instead? It\u2019s a half-assed generic anime story that somehow made me care just about anything else than our two main leads. By the time this show reaches near its end, you may be wondering if Tada and Teresa are even worth being the main characters. It\u2019s almost sad to see how the cookie crumbles. I\u2019m not going to lie. The suspenseful subplot about Alec\u2019s love interest made me more curious than to see if Tada and Teresa will get together in the end or not.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my disappointment in the storytelling, there\u2019s a lot of good to say about the animation quality. This was expected as some of the staff previously worked on Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. In essence, the show is colorful with a sense of youth. The springtime backgrounds really brings out the setting that\u2019s sprinkled with vibrant colors. Character designs also look elegant especially for characters like Teresa, Charles, and Alec. Even comedic moments are timed right with the body language and humorous expressions. There are also windows of moments that makes couple pairings impactful especially for the case of Teresa and Tada. While the show lacks impact on storytelling, the technical quality definitely deserves some praise. Even the photography elements got my attention with the precise shots and camera angles. Similarly, the music of the series brings an element of beauty thanks to the modern talents of Yukari Hashimoto. She also previously worked on Nozaki-kun and there\u2019s definitely a similar feel in the music for both shows. The voice cast also did a phenomenal job at portraying their characters. Nyanko Big especially gets praise from me as a cat that is made larger than life. Even Teresa and Charles deserves some attention for their voice being filled with elegance and charm. They behave like characters of upper class in their home nation and that\u2019s something I find believable.\\n\\n\r\nWith all due respect, it\u2019s really hard for me to say that Tada-kun succeeded in the end with what it offered. The show started with a lot of promise but ultimately stabbed itself in the foot. It really felt like a test of patience for viewers that degenerated into a cheesy rom-com story. Characters like Alec and Nynako Big overshadowed them early on and it\u2019s hard to look back. I\u2019m not a big fan of photography and this anime is definitely not worth a thousand words.",

            "content": "TLDR:\r\nTada is a nice and enjoyable watch that keeps you interested in what to come. If you want a solid, bubbly and romantic anime that isn't a repetitive washing of a romance, look no further. \r\nRatings~ Story [7] Art [7] Sound [6] Character [6] Enjoyment [8] Overall [7]\r\nStory [7]\r\nPerhaps a strength of the anime thus far. Tada progresses well and adds to the overall appeal of the bubbly anime. The reoccurring use of photography as the main theme holds it all together and in the end, we are left with an interesting anime in which, our attention is kept focused on the relationships within theseries.\\n\\n\r\nArt [7]\\n\r\nIt presents a unique, yet quality approach to their intended romantic appeal. Soft and nice on the eyes and is consistent in its application. Considering that the series is set on photography, it's to be expected that the art is up to par and so far, it has delivered.\\n\\n\r\nSound [6]\\n\r\nOp and ending tracks are fine. The voice acting is a lacklustre here and there but gets the job done. Nothing great of note here, especially as the plot doesn't really put an emphasis on sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [6] \\n\r\nTada is a mix of extremely different yet familiar characters. They work well together and the series allows them to interact with each other and develop their relationships. However, I can't help but notice hollowness of some characters. It seems to me that Tada presents a character, says \"ok this is your background\" and then chucks them into the group to make them do things (*cough* Gentar\u014d *cough* -_-). As a result, we are left with some noticeably uninteresting and forgetful characters early on into the series\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [8]\\n\r\nIt's really interesting to see how the characters pan out, early on in this series and its all due to the plots situation. The meshing of drastically different characters and how they interact with each other is enjoyable to watch and I can't help but wonder \"whats going to happen to x and y next\". The combination of seemingly night and day characters is what really has pushed this anime past \"just another good watch\".\\n\\n\r\nOverall [7]\\n\r\nTada presents us with an interesting plot and drives us to watch. Through its interestingly stereotypical characters, and the unpredictability of their interactions, we are left with a great bubbly watch that you will look forward to and will lighten your day by even just a little.",

            "content": "Warning: this review contains spoilers.\r\nIf you're looking for an anime with bad characters, over the top cliches, undeveloped romances, drama just for the sake of drama and big events that happens because of no reason at all, you've come to the right place. Many people would argue that this anime is better then that because it had 2 or 3 good episodes at the begining, but don't let youreself be fooled. \r\nAnimation and sound: are decent. They don't stand out but neither drag the series lower that it actualy is.\r\nCharacters: here is the main problem of this anime. The characters seems \r\n to be takenout of a garbage can. They are one dimensional and full of cliches. They don't develop of the course of the show(except for the MC, and it's rather poor) and in some cases they are rather anoying. Don't believe me? Let's see what we've got:\\n\r\n-The princess from another country. She came for what looks to be a \"study trip\". Her inteligence  is below average.\\n\r\n-Her tsundere childhood friend. Good at most things. Protects the princess. Has the strength and moves of an elite trained soldier.\\n\r\n-The guy that princess is suposed to marry. He comes later into the show. He seems like the perfect guy from every single aspect.\\n\r\n-The MC that is not interested into girls, only to fall in love at the end of series. Tragical past. \\n\r\n-The MC's best friend. Nice guy but very egocentric.\\n\r\n-The leader of club senpai. Highly perverted. He loves an idol.\\n\r\n-The only girl in the group. Looks nerdy but hidenly it's the idol that senpai loves. (Weird thing is no one from the initial group seems to notice)\\n\r\n-The MC's little sister.\\n\r\n-Another guy just to have someone who the little sister can love.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters seem to stay in the description above, having very little semnificative traits.\\n\\n\r\nThe story: Here is my problem with the story- characters seem to act on nothing but impulse and events seem to happen just for the sake of it. To give you an short example: in an episode a character seems to find a mising cat(which was pretty big deal then) by talking to a cat. That scene it was never explained and still stands as the most example of bad writing this season. I still don't know why the audience just accepted it. But enough with , let's see the story in more details.\\n\r\nThe story presents the love story between Teresa,a princess from a fictional country and Tada, an ordinary japanese boy. Teresa is eleventh grade, so we can asume she is around 16-17 years old and is to become queen at age of 18. Why is it fixed for her to become queen so soon, with the current king stil alive it is never explained. Anyway, our future queen probably prepares hard for the time she will be queen, in order to provide a better future for an entire country, right? WRONG! She takes what it looks to be a \"study vacantion\" in a foreing country which she likes. Why she loves the country? Because she saw a tv show from that country and aparently likes it so much that she even learned the language.\\n\r\nThat's why i writted before that her inteligence is below average. Most of the decision she takes are half-baked and defy any logic an ordinary person would have. In most cases her way of thinking is closer to a 5 years old with mental disorder then to a future queen. A good example of why traditional monarchy failed.Aparently her childhood friend came with her , and for good reason. Who would ever trust this girl alone? \\n\r\nBut let's continue the story. When the girls were going to their residence in Japan, aparently the princess got separated from her friend. How? She simply got out of the subway at a random , for no reason at all. And only noticed she was alone, at the wrong place, in a foreign country way to late. To make situation worse, her entire papers, moneys and even her phone, was at her friend. A normal person here would try to reunite with her companion, but not our genius princes. She decides to visit what looks to be a tourist attraction, for no concrete reason at all . What is even more disturbing is that at some point, she decides to jump in a river, because it looked like that river from the show she liked. Lucky for her , there was another character that stop her: Tada.\\n\r\nHe is a simple boy , who lives with her gramp and her sister. They own a coffee shop. He met the princess at that tourist attraction and ended up taking her home. Not for some pervert reason because he is aparently not interested in love. The princess is reunited with her friend, and aparently they live next door to caffeteria Tada family owns. For obvious reason thei real identity is kep secret. Despite hard criticism, this was the best part of this anime.\\n\r\nAnd so the story starts, bad characters come, romances are started only to never be concluded and at some point even some bad drama comes in. What i'm talking about with this non-sense drama? That one episode when Teresa and Tada talked about their tragic past. What bad writting? Well, aparently Tada's tragic story was having his parents died in a car accident, when he was a kid, when he and his dad had a little fight. This is the ultimate cliche drama ever saw. But don't worry , Teresa's story comes and it's something original. I mean, you have to be stupid to use this kind of a story as a cliche. Aparently Teresa also had a tragic moment in her childhood, on pair with Tada's. Poor girl has make her friend cry. When they were 6 years old. The only tragic thing in this episode is the writing.\\n\r\nThen , finally comes the romance. Considering this being a romance anime you would expect to see some development. Wrong again! Most romances between side characters remain unconcluded. Unconcluded is a strong word since we only had hints of characters liking eachother. Except for the cats. They definatly got the best romance in this show.\\n\r\nThe romance of the main characters is even worse. The MC only realises he likes the princess in the last episode. There they have a nice talk , where she listens to him and admits she is in love with him. Aparently it was love at first sight. Why they waited till the last moment to realizes it? Beats me, but if I had to asume, i'd say it's because of bad writing. But her having already a fiance means they can't be together. So they sadly part ways. And here things start to make no-sense once again. Aparently the wedding is such a big deal that they end up in that way, for the sake of drama. Then the guy she is supposed to marry, cancels the wedding like it was nothing. Only for the last scene of this anime to show Teresa and Tada reunited togheter , aparently in a very random way. I call it BS!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I literally watched the last 5 episodes at 2x speed, only to make it end faster. It was painfull to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, i gave it a 4. I probably won't recomand this anime to anyone i don't hate. I belive it is a mockery of a romance.",

            "content": "While Wotakoi mostly focused on the comedy aspect of rom-com, Tadakoi's focus lay more on the romance aspect. Obviously it isn't just a romance, it definitely had some amusing moments early on while they were laying the groundwork for the more heavy drama laden romantic chase in the waning episodes. It almost feels unfair to compare the two shows as I have been doing with them both, but it's just so difficult for me not to. I watched them on the same day, back-to-back for eleven weeks straight. They're the same genre, but each with different focal points and strengths, which made me appreciate whatboth Wotakoi and Tadakoi did differently, and in some cases, better than each other. I mentioned it in my Wotakoi review, but I'd watch Tadakoi for the dramatic romance first, then switch to Wotakoi for the lighthearted comedy. They were perfect foils for my Thursdays. But now, to dive deeper into the nuances of Tadakoi.\\n\\n\r\nAmong the multitudes of things that Tadakoi did correctly, I think their biggest win lies in the characters. They did such a good job getting you to care about them and learn their quirky personalities, each of which was hiding some deeper insecurity that was, unfortunately, not touched on for some of the less important characters due to lack of time. By episodes five, I felt that I had a pretty good connection with all of the characters on the screen and, if not for the lack of episodes, I feel like each could have gone through extremely satisfying arcs. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about the few episodes, in the end it didn't matter that much, the show was always about Mitsuyoshi and Theresa. I feel like too much of a focus on the supporting cast would have taken away from the impact of the main love story, which dominates the remaining episodes and doesn't disappoint with its twists and turns. In fact, I felt as if I was right there with Mitsuyoshi, getting slowly drawn in by this strange, quirky foreign girl. Yes, I got so invested that I even teared up when Mitsuyoshi's version of the ending came on in episode eleven and I think that speaks volumes as to my feelings on the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing that really stands out when I look at Tadakoi, are the general expectations laid upon it. Everyone, including me, thought that it was going to be completely generic after three or so episodes. And from that outlook, it definitely seemed like it would be. But it did such a great job at subverting those expectations. I, like so many others, thought we'd get that classic \"everyone's ship sails, except for that one asshole who gets in the way of the main couple\". But everything about that sentence was wrong when you compare that to Tadakoi. Only one ship really sails, and the others are somewhat hinted, but never confirmed. Probably best of all, the romantic rival isn't the classic jerk who doesn't really love the girl, hates the protagonist, etc. Charles was legitimately a great guy, and it made him an even better character in the grand scheme of things. That was such a refreshing take on the trope, that I just had to find time to mention it here.\\n\\n\r\nThose are just a couple of things that I love about Tadakoi and there's so much more to rave about, but that would take up far too much time. Before I conclude, I just have to comment on my favorite part of the show, which is the ending song. I love that song. It's among one of my favorite endings of all time, though it's personally in tight competition with Alternative GGO's ending song for ED of the season.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to come up with any complaints with Tadakoi, I'd have to say that my biggest gripe is the fact that they opened so many story lines with no intention of ever finishing them. Maybe I'm incorrect with that and we'll get a spinoff or OVA that ties up many of the loose ends regarding the supporting cast, who kind of get the shaft for the latter half of the show. Not a bad thing, in my opinion, but I can see why it'd be a negative for some. There may be a little too much melodrama for my liking too, but I sort of feel like it was all necessary, to drive Mitsuyoshi forward.\\n\\n\r\nDespite those little gripes, I adore this little love story. It was self-contained and did enough to set it apart from other romances for me. I won't be knee jerk and say that it's my favorite romance of all time, or even rom-com, but it comes damn close in certain aspects. Dare I even say that I liked it more than Wotakoi overall? My score certainly reflects that. And, while I may have scored it a little higher than many would say is deserving, I have to say that it does deserve it for all the enjoyment it gave me for thirteen weeks. In fact, Tadakoi may just be my anime of the season.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: This is my first anime review, so I've probably gotten something \"wrong\". But I've had animes that I liked and didn't like and I can tell you that this one is one of the former. I'm probably fan-insert-gender-neutral-term-ing (jk, I'm not a crazy feminist) here, so take everything I say with a pinch of salt.\r\nFirst off title. \"Tada doesn't fall in love\". ok, that's all I have to say about the title, but keep that in mind if you're gonna watch the anime. Plis continue reading my review. (ooh, and also, I know that the poster looks boring (that's what i thought too) butthe anime is pretty good, so give it a shot)\\n\\n\r\nI don't know, maybe it's just me, but I absolutely *love* this anime. It's something light on the heart, packed with laughs and generally heart-warming. The first scene alone put a big smile on my face! Shortly, the art is beautiful, the music is light and complementing, the voices are on point with the characters, and I feel very optimistic about this anime. Also, I know how it feels to be borderline frightened by anime after watching heart-breaking ones, so if you're trying to avoid your daily dose of depression, don't be worried to watch this. It's not the type that will end in heartbreak.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nSo, story, I'll admit, there's not much brewing (at least I hope not). The anime sorta gives me Slice of Life feels, but given the no-so-ordinary circumstances of the characters, it's not quite... how you say in my language, \"tepat\", or fitting, I guess, in the SoL category. The \"suasana\", I don't know this in English, is a well-blended mix of ordinary life, funny cues, and just a bit of crazy (like less than 1% Gintama-crazy). In the end, there's this sort of happy-homey feeling that makes you strangely feel... welcome? I don't know, watch it yourself. Seriously, just watch the first episode (pls) and you'll get me.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nJaw-dropping. Drawings are clean-cut and just nice with thin borders and accentuated shadows. The backgrounds are beautiful too and (this is gonna sound cheesy) really highlight the hospitable blend of human and natural Japan (that Doga Kobo wants you to see anyway). I'm no art expert, so I'm not gonna put 10 because I wouldn't even know what qualifies for a 10, but this... This is something that my gut tells me is worth a special something \\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nBackground music is very subtle and feels customized to complement every other scene. But that's not the main highlight of sound. The main highlight *must* be the voices. The characters' voices are really the music of this anime. Their sounds feel really... real, and flow with the characters' scene behaviors and personalities really well. ESPECIALLY (and you know I'm serious when I'm typing in FULL CAPS) Mamoru Miyano's Kaoru. Credit's given where credit's due, and Miyano really does have the credit due. His cheeky, and wavery yet simultaneously confident voice alone, I admit, plays a big factor in why I give sound 10. Here; here is where I say, and really mean it:\\n\r\nGood job.\\n\r\nOh ya, the ED is like ok, I guess, but the OP is nicer.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThese guys are a fun, relaxed (but somehow also energetic...) bunch, that makes me laugh, smile, spit water, then smile again. There aren't any \"chibi\" scenes so it's not really \"that\" kind of comedy (though I'm not sure, myself, what that means), but it still has its outrageously funny scenes, and for about 1/3 to 3/5 of the episode (I'm not sure this is true, but, whatever, UR NOT MY MOM) I'm left laughing out loud (for real). In between the laughs though, there are genuine smiles to be had at the warm friendships and love everyone has for each other. Each character acts distinctly from each other and doesn't change in behavior, but they all get along well (I say that, but, fufufu). They all bear semblance to certain typical archetypes but are more unique than not. The way they interact together is both funny, and soothing, and really act in a way that both makes sense, and can please a watcher (you). I get the sense that Doga Kobo really put effort in planning and executing the timing of each scene, to really complement the comedic timing, along with the occasional (but, again, far from Gintama-crazy level) outrageous comedic \"deus ex machina\" cues. I'm rambling. Right. Anyway, watch the first damn episode, you won't regret it!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI really do like this anime, and want to see more episodes. There's not much else to say here, other than this:\\n\r\nIf you've read thus far, open CrunchyRoll and watch the first episode immediately. Seriously. I'm not joking. You WILL love it.",

            "content": "When I reviewed 3D Kanojo Real Girl and Woatku Love is Hard For A Otaku I mentioned that were two romcom shows that were competing with each other? Well, there was actually three romcom anime that were competing each and that anime is Tada Never Falls in love. Unlike the other two Tada Never Fall in Love is an anime original probably meaning it's not as restrictive as the other two it has to follow the source carefully or else fans of the source material would riot. Also unlike the other two where I watched them weekly, I decided to wait until once it finishedairing and I wanted to see people's opinion about it before I even invest my time with this show. While people options on the show were mixed compared to Wotaku I still wanted to give a shot because I wanted to see if the show is actually better than Woatku as well not being worse than 3D Kanojo Real Girl. So after marathoning all 13 episodes of Tada Never Fall in Love all I can say it's pretty solid romcom anime that I liked. Not on the same level as Wotaki but still good enough to be one of the better animes of Spring 18 season.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story follows a boy named Tada who doesn't know about any form of love. During a regular day in the cherry blossoms, Tada decides to take pictures there and while he's taking pictures he meets a transfer student from a European country called Larsenburg named Teresa. Upon arriving in Japan she gets's lost from her travel comparison. Like with any typical male lead Tada decides to help her by taking her to her grandfather's coffee shop from there relationships will form and will Tada finally understand the meaning of love.\\n\\n\r\nThe story for Tada Never Fall in Love is pretty solid overall. Like with any good romcom anime the story is heavily character driven where it relay on the characters from the interactions to relationships more than the plot itself and surprisingly the show does a good job at being a charted driven story.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main things that I liked about Tada Never falls in love it how it gives the charterers the appropriate screen-time that they need. The main characters will obviously get most screen-time while the side characters get they screen-time that they need without overstaying the welcome or having barely any screen-time at. This alone makes it's main and some of the side characters more memorable. It does a great job as tacking the themes of friendship, love and understanding each other in the more realistic way where every single character shows a different side to love and friendship making they character interactions stand out in the process which speaking off.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I liked about Tada Never falls in love is how it was able to avoid most romcom cliches that seen to plague mainly romcom shows such as a generic lead, a tsundere main love interest, long and complected love triangles, harems etc for the most apart least.\\n\r\nIt also does a good job as tacking the themes of friendship, love, royalty love and understanding each other in the more realistic way where every single character shows a different side to love and friendship making they character interactions stand out in the process which speaking off. The characters interactions as well the plot twist in this show were well handed as not only the interactions for each character was great but the way the plot twist in the series which I won't spoil.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about Tada Never falls in love is how slow paced the romance is. Unlike most other romcoms where the romance elements feel underdeveloped thanks to lack of focus on the actual romance Tada and Terca slowly build a relationship with each in a way that is satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on about how good this show is but I think it's talk about the show's flaws.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters while I appreciate the slower pacing in the show in favour for better chararter development for the mains I thought at times the first half was too slow for my liking and what I mean by this is certain scenes in the show seen to drag way longer than it should.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of drag the second issue that I have with this show it was the comedy itself or in this case too much. I know the show eventually fixed this problem in the last couple of episode but my god the comedy in this show to drag on to a point where at times it overtakes the romance elements. Not only that but the comedy itself just become unfunny and at times repetitive.\\n\r\nThe final issue that I have with the show is that it's how predictable it became. Now being predictable doesn't equal bad but there were certain character expressions in the second half ultimately predicted the shows ending. I know shows like this are meant to be predictable but I honestly wish they didn't have to make it this very oblivious to the viewer with theses certain character expressions.\\n\r\nOverall despite it having some issues, I thought the story was good and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the characters to Tada Never Falls in love I thought they were pretty solid for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nOur main protagonist Tada is a pretty solid romcom lead. While he may not be a complex and well written as other romcom leads but he still a very interesting and likeable chararters nonetheless. He's chararter development while more in the predictable side was still fun and enjoyable to watch.\\n\r\nTeresa\u2019s is a pretty good romcom female lead. She is an overall nice person who is kind to every-time but at the same time she is very royalty and does not show any arrogance in terms of expectations where she is the Princess of Larsenburg as well being the heir of Queen's throne.\\n\\n\r\nWhile she doesn't as developed as much as Tada she's still a nicely developed and fun character that I liked.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the main characters were great the side characters not so much. Apart from Alec and Kaworu the characters are nothing more than comedic devices than actual characters. It got to a point where if you removed every character from the Photography Club apart from Tada, Teresa, Alce, and Kaworu the story would not change one bit. This alone was the weakest part of Tada Never Fall in Love.\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nCompare to the other two this show visually is the best looking of the three.\\n\r\nThe art-style of the show was very appealing to look thanks to its soft use of colour palettes for the character designs and the background scenery. The character designs themselves were great and well drawn. Also, the lighting and use of camera shots in this were brilliant and well thought out.\\n\r\nThe actual animation while basic still pretty nice for what it was.\\n\r\n7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in Tada Never Falls in Love is honestly for the most part forgettable. Sure there are a couple of tracks that were solid but at a lot of the time they are not that memorable at all\\n\r\nThe opening theme Otomodachi Film by Masayoshi Ooishi is a great and catchy opening that fits well with the upbeat tone of the series.\\n\r\nThe ending theme Love Song by Manaka Iwami is a cute and adorable ending theme that I really enjoyed.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is a bit of a mixed bag overall\\n\r\nWhile some Seiyuus did a good job others ranged from okay to overdoing they performances where it became quite annoying.\\n\r\nAt this time of the review there is no English Dub for this series but hopefully, it will get one sometime in the future.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nSo that was Tada Kun Never falls in Love.\\n\\n\r\nA flawed but good romcom series that I enjoyed quite a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was solid for the most part, the characters were mostly good the visuals are good. The only negatives things I can say about this show were the mediocre treatment for the side characters, too much comedy and at times slow pacing that seems to drag. Other than this Tada Never Falls in Love is a pretty solid series. While it's not better than Wotaku it's still a hell of a lot better than Takagi san and especially 3D Kanojo Real Girl.\\n\r\nFinal Score 7/10",

            "content": "A romantic anime this season? Hmm.... never been a huge fan of the romance genre, but sure I'll give it a go. Whoa, Tada-kun is surprisingly good for a romance anime. I like it. It's a different type of romance, but one which I end up liking. \r\nStory: Tada-kun is about a Japanese guy, Tada Mitsuyoshi, falling in love with a gaijin, Teresa Wagner, who's actually a Princess from Lux... I mean Larsenburg :v. The story is quite interesting, because they develop the romantic relationship very well. Teresa was the one who liked Tada at first of course, when their eyes first met :v, butthen as they get to know each other more, Tada eventually falls in love with her too! Not to forget the fantastic friends they have who's always supporting then. Ijuuin, Tada's best friend, Yui, Tada's younger sister, Alexandra aka Alec, Teresa's best friend and guardian, and of course, Charles, Teresa's supposed husband-to-be. The ending is.... rather cliche, because Tada ends up with Teresa and not the other way around(as always with romance anime), which I don't exactly like. I mean, usually in a love triangle yo'd expect the 2 guys to fight for the girl but not in Tada-kun. Charles let Teresa go to Tada, which is quite disappointing, I was expecting a fight to the death between Tada and Charles(although that'd be very ugly) What I really like about the story is how they manage to fuse romance and comedy and turning Tada-kun into a Romcom anime, which is pretty entertaining, to say the least. Ah, last but not least, RAINBOW SHOGUN!!!\\n\r\nRating: 8.9/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The animation is excellent for Tada-kun, the way the scenery and facial expressions are animated. You can tell the producers put in a lot of effort to make the animation look good.\\n\r\nRating: 8.8/10 \\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: Probably the most catchy opening this season. And the ost, light-hearted. \\n\r\nRating: 8.2/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I love the way the producers approached character development for this anime. At first, Tada is portrayed as a rather quiet, introverted person with Teresa being the extroverted, happy-go-lucky person who always smiles. But then, as the two of them get to know each other better, Tada-kun starts to open up to Teresa, even sharing his very personal feelings about his past. Now that, is very interesting. Oh and dont forget Tada's best pal Ijuuin who's always supporting Tada to the end, even going so far as to follow Tada all the way to Lux... Larsenburg. And Alec too, being the support pillar of Teresa during Teresa's saddest moments and Charles, the very kind and friendly person who only wants Teresa to be happy. To me he's the MVP of the anime, because he gave up his love for Teresa in order for Teresa to pursue her love, Tada. That, is a very manly thing to do. \\n\r\nRating: 9.3/10\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Tada-kun is a very good romcom for all the romcom anime fans. Definitely recommend watching it! The criticism that I can give is that, the ending is too cliche and uninteresting, I mean, would not 2 guys fight over 1 girl?! \\n\\n\r\nFinal rating: 8.8/10",

Then again it does make you fall in love with the characters which I must say were really well created and to be honest when your eyes catch this awesome art and animation with the perfect soundtrack and background music accompanying them it gets a bit hard not tolove the anime even though it has some shortcomings esp. later in. \\n",

            "content": "Let me get this clear THE STORY OF THIS ANIME IS GOOD! I dunno why people giving this anime a hard time because of some over used plot or some stupid cliches from other animes. But you know what? It doesn't matter, because this anime delivered the story quite well, Kodus to the guys behind this! I don't care if I watched a whole bunch of these, i still won't get bored from it. (YouGuysWatchAlotOfKdramasWhenInfactItsJustAllTheSame!) The point here is, YOU GUYS who watched so many \"Master Pieces\" doesn't have the time (because your too busy with your 2D waifus!) to re-evaluate the quality and valueof some animes such as these, because some of you have set the BARS too high based on what you have seen on the past and you became a picky person just to suit your taste buds. These guys think they know all about it on how anime RomComs should be, well, if you're so good then stop reading this and stop making stupid reviews and then write your own story and share it so we could criticize it as well! I mean, People come on! Atleast appreciate the effort and time spent on this! \\n\\n\r\nStory: The story is not bad, it's just that other people are thinking that this anime doesn't have any originality so they're making it look bad by comparing and downsizing and making rants about it. The story is not over the top with some huge twist and it's not too dramatic like any other animes (like DiF) do just to get your attention, it's just Plain Old Sweet Love Story, Its enough to tugg your heart. Well, just don't look at the ratings and see for yourself. \\n\\n\r\nWell here goes, the story is about Tada-kun, let me introduce him a lilbit, he's the kind of person who is hard to read, because he does not show emotions or any kind of facial expressions towards his friends and his family. After a dramatic incident that happened to him 10 years ago caused him to close his heart to anyone, he is just a go with the flow kind of guy. He's not your typical perverted, supersmart, heartthrob, weird, narcissist, clumsy, dumb, cringy, loud, oblivious, masochistic kind of MC in short he is just a hardworking, a handy man, silent and a normally matured kid just like some of us in the real world, realistically speaking. Some girls in real life actually prefers guys like these one, hard to read and hard to get and pretty mysterious and sometimes unexpectedly sweet! He reminds me of my younger self until i met my wife actually, she change my life, turned me around a full 180. That's why i have some kind of connection from this.\\n\\n\r\nHe was that kind of person until He met Teresa! Because of her, Tada-kun slowly changed, even his club mates, friends and family were all shocked because of his development throughout the series. But he does not realize his own feelings yet. Its up to you to find out more.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is Amazing! I love how colorful it was, designs and backgrounds are good, i hope this will get english dubbed so i could enjoy the art style more with the story. 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: is just okay and sweet. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Some characters, aside from the two leads, are quite interesting. HINA, PIN, and ALEC caught my attention. I wish there was a separate arc just for them, i would love to see how their love story unfold. If they include that i bet this would be one of the best there is. But sadly we are left hanging, but it's okay they were not the main focus. If there is a second season just for them i would be overjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: did i or did i not enjoy this? Ofcourse yes! I did enjoy watching it, and I would watch it over again. Btw, I wont tell you what type of ending it has because it's somekind of a spoiler if i do. I want you to enjoy it too. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: its been sweet, kinda reminds me of my own love story in some way. I give it 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nAnd oh btw! If you like this anime, you're in for a treat because it has some similarities, just a little bit, the anime is called Ano Natsu De Matteru (Waiting In The Summer) it's a good anime you guys should also check and i highly recommend it. \\n\\n\r\nSayonara! Arigatou Guzaimasu!",

            "content": "Tada-kun is like that store bought bagel for breakfast with barely not enough cream cheese (sorry, if you don't get the idea. But, stay with me). The first couple of bites are delightfully sweet and savory. It makes you feel like you're being over satisfied with your decision to grab this bagel. However, after finishing one side, and taking the bite of the 2nd half you realize, there's nothing new to experience. The taste in your mouth is no longer of delight, but middling satisfaction. And, that experience is the essence of what Tada-kun during my runthrough of it.\r\nThe opening episodes were a whirlwind ofcomedic poise and interesting character chemistries. I wanted to know more about every character, especially Alec. I understood that each character was created with a VERY FIRM caricature of stereotypes, but I believed the screenwriters could mold them into something dynamic. Tada-kun seemed like the generic despondent MC (similar to Decim from Death Parade) whose nature would slowly develop from being around an energetic foil (Teresa). Every other character had their own pairings to develop chemistry with and bring their own unique personalities to form a fun group to be around.\\n\\n\r\nBUT NO.\\n\\n\r\nTHAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.\\n\\n\r\nTada-kun after episode 5 this anime becomes the 2nd half of the bagel. It slows down into a snails pace of a romantic-comedy that doesn't really understand its own potential. It focuses too much on the idea of trying to create this forced narrative between Tada and Teresa that pays little homage to other potential romances like Sugimoto and Hasegawa or Alec and Charles (even though it seems written on the wall.)\\n\\n\r\nIt keeps petering along with the Slice of Life aspects making all the romance come to a halt to allow for its comedy bits to shine. While I didn't find those shorts skits funny, I did find them to be enjoyable fluff. \\n\\n\r\nI do share various sentiments with other reviews of this anime being invariably disappointed with how this show turned out. But, that doesn't mean I think it should be rated lower than a 6.\\n\\n\r\nIt's an above-average anime that was only helped with Wotakoi airing at the same time. I don't hope for a second season because the ending that was given to us was fairly closed-ended, unless Doga Kobo decides to go forward with less Slice of Life and more Romantic progression.",

            "content": "Tada never falls in Love has one of the satisfying endings that reminds me of when i was watching Toradora. A new original anime done by Dogakobo, a studio well known for making comedic anime such as Yuru Yuri and Umaru chan. \r\nThe anime has it's typical rom-com elements that of-course to give entertainment to the viewers, however it also explore the main character's background on his mundane/chill/suppressed feelings attitude as the same of the main heroine's story albeit was only exposed in the remaining few episodes. \r\nI also love the character developments among his circle and the heroine itself, leading to goal on whatthe series is achieving for, and the tense whether it will be a happy ending or not. However i was not satisfied on them not focusing the other characters background but i understand the reason for it since this was an original anime groundwork. Nevertheless with the poor and rushed plot line due to episode limitation, i still somehow enjoy the series thanks to its character development and comedic elements.\\n\\n\r\nI would watch the last 4 minutes of the final episode part lot because it's just satisfying to see how they character shifted from \"Never falls in love\" to become \"Falls in love\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyed the OST and love the tempo they had, also liken the OP and ED song which perfectly distinguish happy and sad feelings. I love the character designs as it reminds me of Gekkan Shoujo anime and their detailing works on buildings and the night starry sky, suitable for taking pictures.\\n\\n\r\nWith that, an overall of 7/10 is the score i will gave to this decent rom-com anime. Recommended to watch? Yes if you are on the feel on watching something new or just want to fill up your free time. However if you want a more decent rom-com with well executed and unrushed plot lines, there are other great show that you can watch than this.",

Just want to know if you should watch it? I've got you covered.\r\nTada-kun is a solid romance anime entry with good pacing and just enough drama to keep you hooked to the end. Nothing ground breaking, but it is a solid choice when looking for a new romance anime.\r\nThankfully a good amount of this show takes place outside of a school setting, which is a nice change from your usual slice of life romance thattakes place with school-age characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC's aren't too-heavily leaning on any major character traits. The story is fairly simple and anyone with even moderate experience watching romance/slice of life anime will recognize where it is headed within the first few episodes. But there is a nice side story involving the MC's family and some surprise history that reveals itself eventually that was a nice breath of fresh air to the traditional story.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is also complete and mostly happy, which always adds a point to my review score.\\n\\n\r\nHIGHLIGHTS: Animation, story, simple characters with no totally-insane character traits, non-Japanese female MC.\\n\\n\r\nDISAPPOINTMENTS: Fairly standard story for the most part, nothing totally ground-breaking in terms of characters or story-line beyond a few surprises, music wasn't anything to write home about.",

            "content": "Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai: A good anime that started 10 episodes later\r\nTada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai could have generated a huge impact; however, bad decisions condemned it to end up as another romantic series.\r\nAnd although I said \"bad decisions\" in the plural, in reality it was only one that generated the avalanche. Which? To have put the plot in motion ten episodes after the beginning of the series.\r\nSure, surely many will say that that does not have to be a blunder, because depending on the duration of the anime there could be enough space to work; however, when the series barely lasts 13 episodes,there is not much room for adjustments. By the way, some spoilers are coming, although I will try not to tell many.\\n\\n\r\nI said in my first impressions that my biggest concern was that the series at the beginning seemed to focus strictly on being a slice of life with strong touches of comedy; however, its setting shouted that a great drama in the story would eventually have to come.\\n\\n\r\nThis implied that the handling of the rhythm was going to be fundamental, because the transition from one end to the other is not something that is easily achieved. Do not forget that the difference in status between Tada and Teresa had to take center stage at some point, of course, considering that the series followed the path of romance with classic drama.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, with the passing of the episodes I must admit that each time I understood less the intentions of the creators of the series. What was your goal with this anime? Slice of life, comedy, light romance, drama? Each new episode focused on casual situations and developed little and nothing of the 4 couples that had shown up at the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, paradoxically, Tada and Teresa, main protagonists of the anime, were those who had the least development as a couple and even as characters. Instead, the focus seemed to be directed towards Kaoru and Alec, Hajime and Hinako and even Gentarou and Yui. However, there was not much progress on those fronts either.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if the above had not covered enough time, the series introduces Charles, but instead of giving weight to his role as the third vertex of an impending love triangle formed by him, Tada and Teresa (the blonde is the official fianc\u00e9 of the Princess); he focuses more on his relationship with Alec, expanding the geometric figure to a square.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's more, the whole of Charles's arc focuses on the feelings that Alec has towards him, with some moments of Tada and Teresa that do not get to majors. And we can not forget that 8 episodes of the series have already elapsed by the end of the arc.\\n\\n\r\nMany times, the defenders of slow or late romances give as a great argument that in this way feelings can be developed progressively, reasonably and credibly; however, this is something that falls under its own weight.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many examples of fast-established couples who have a great development in their relationship. Kotarou and Akane from Tsuki ga Kirei, Narumi and Hirotaka from Wotakoi or Qin Yun and Yi Xiao from the Chinese cultivation novel Seeking the Flying Sword Path are clear examples of this. On the other hand, Ichigo and Orihime or Rukia and Renji of Bleach are examples of the opposite. Couples who took hundreds of chapters (literally) to establish themselves, but in spite of that, their union felt totally forced.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, the speed or time a couple establishes does not necessarily denote a good development of romance; and it is here that a bad decision regarding rhythm prevented Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai from developing its full potential.\\n\\n\r\nIt was not until episode 10, when Teresa decides to return untimely to her native country, when the gears were finally set in motion. And oh boy that from there the series showed that it was able to give us magical and powerful moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole process lived by Tada, his trip to Larsenburg to look for Teresa, all that his presence there originated in the blonde, Charles and Alec; The way in which the outcome was prepared and the end in itself were handled in very good shape. However, it never stopped feeling rushed and it was impossible to wonder why this drama had not started before and so develop it to the rhythm that corresponded. Especially, considering that all the time spent in the other three couples did not end up bearing fruit because in the end nothing was achieved in any of the cases. In fact, in the secondary pairs, it was not even reached a point where the relationship was indirectly confirmed. If in the end they were going to leave all those unfinished plots, why dedicate so much space to them?\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, the couple of Charles and Alec could have developed much more, but the short time that was at the end of the series barely gave to show brushstrokes. And that is precisely why you can not stop thinking that this series was for much more; however, the approach was totally wrong for too long.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the technical section. The character design was not bad, the animation had a good level, the soundtrack was too generic; and the direction will carry forever the weight of having condemned Tada-kun wa Koi or Shinai to be a series that in a few weeks will have fallen into oblivion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nThis series may have left its mark, but unfortunately it will end up being seen as one more series among many that exist in the genre.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The plot is a bit of a bummer as we get a clich\u00e9 at the end but before it it\u2019s pretty original.  The ending left a lot of things vague and I wish they could\u2019ve taken out one of the fillers and replaced it with an episode that gave us a more detailed ending.  This leads me to the next topic, there are fillers.  Sure they make you laugh and are actually pretty enjoyable but they are still fillers.  They have almost nothing to do withthe plot and are only there to waste episodes.  The characters are very interesting to stay the least.  They all are polar opposites if there were enough poles for all of them but together they truly know what being a friend is about.  Overall I really enjoyed this anime.  I cannot guarantee that everyone will enjoy it but I know that it was a very fun few hours watching this anime.  Give it a shot if you\u2019re up for a fun watch that may make you feel just a little warm inside.  And then crush you when you realize you have to watch anime to make you feel good since there\u2019s no one for you in real life.  *cry*. But actually give this anime a try you shouldn\u2019t be disappointed if you know that it\u2019s not a hardcore romance.  Just a normal highschool romance with a twist.",

Romance is one of my favorite genre and ihave watched a lot of romance anime. If i were to rank it in my anime list then maybe it will not get a high rank in my list. But as i said before story is good so you can watch it if you want some decent romance. \\n\r\nArt and music was better than story. If i were to say about art then i can say it was a colorful anime maybe like a rainbow. Well i kind of like this type of animation so art was one of the reason i watched this anime. But they could have done better maybe. Sound was also good. The best was the ending song of the anime it was great, seriously great. The music they put in between the episodes that was also good. Based on the scene that was going on i can say they have put some good background sounds.\\n\r\n About character i am not satisfied with them. They could have done a lot better. It was not that bad but these characters were not for me. The only character i like is Tada kun because of his personality. There is one more guy Ijuuin Kaoru. He is a great friend who cared a lot of Tada kun. I was happy after looking such a character. About others i will not say they are bad but they are not for me. \\n\r\nWhat matters is the enjoyment. A anime should provide the best possible enjoyment to the viewer. It was fun to watch this anime. I did not get bored. But i was expecting more from this. Don't know why but i was just expecting. Some good comedy is also there which makes you smile but not it will not make you laugh. If you want to watch a romance anime with some comedy then it is for you. Even you are not a fan of romance with comedy even then you should try to watch it. It is a good anime.",

            "content": "Tadakun has been just watchable thus far, but mediocre-to-lousy writing is bringing it down. Characters this extravagant and scenarios this unlikely really belong in an over-the-top farce \u00e0 la Nisekoi; they jar completely with the lower-key, more naturalistic tone being attempted. It all comes off as a wild clash of story elements with little serious thought given to reconciling them. The core, Tada-Teresa romance is underdeveloped and under-justified. Teresa acts almost as if she came to Japan for the specific purpose of standing around in the park looking helpless and then falling in love with the first eligible Japanese dude who offered assistance. She immediatelymeets his family and is totally at ease with them; her hotel is coincidentally directly next door; for some reason she's enrolled in his middle-ranking Japanese high school. They barely even lampshade this stuff.\\n\\n\r\nFor that matter, the whole concept that Teresa is a foreigner at all seems highly questionable. As far as I can tell she's a Japanese in a colorful wig, as are all the other Larsenburg / Luxembourgish characters. Maybe the house of de Larsenburg has been secretly relying on Yamato stock to make up some genetic deficiency. Aside from hair and eye color, Teresa's foreignness is expressed entirely in a naive Weebish love of all things Japanese, which is never disappointed and which all the Japanese cast seem to regard as perfectly natural since obviously Japan is thoroughly wonderful and has no exasperating or disappointing aspects for anyone. This is set in Ginza in 2018! We live in a society!\\n\\n\r\nBut the side stories are even worse. There's *another* goddess with an obvious secret identity who's in love for no believable reason with a guy far below her league (and unlike Tadakun, who at least does seem to have a winning personality, her guy is an obnoxious gravure idol otaku.) There's a male sidekick who's... for some reason a dog? There's an obese cat who's just kind of there doing his own story. And these people take up a LOT of screen time, it's not just momentary relief from the main plot.\\n\\n\r\nThis show needed to either embrace the zaniness and tell a fast-paced madcap story, or else tell its basic story in a serious, thought-out way that doesn't rely on characters just conforming to the predetermined needs of the plot. Falling between two stools like this is no good.",

The main character isn't some over the top naive and annoying characters he's more calm and collected. The store had a nice flow in terms of character development and timings.\r\nThe issues i had with the show were that the comedy was a bit forced, it wasn't natural.

            "content": "\u201cMediocre!\u201d Dude got his face ripped off (Mad Max Fury Road)\r\nAfter this past season, I think it\u2019s fair to assume that romantic comedy anime has finally reached its point of saturation. Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai, or, Tada Never Falls in Love as the gringos say, is perhaps the most blatant lie ever told through a title since \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d. \u201cTada-koi\u201d, for short, is an \u201coriginal\u201d concept birthed out of Doga Kobo and helmed by Mitsue Yamazaki, who is perhaps most known for having directed \u201cMonthly Girls\u2019 Nozaki-kun\u201d, a much more ambitious and consistent project than Tada-koi could ever hope to be. For amyriad of reasons, Tada-koi will perhaps go down as one of the most rote by numbers contemporary romantic comedy anime to ever do it. If this is the new standard for \u201coriginal\u201d concepts moving forward, then it\u2019s best to temper expectations for any shows in the future that fall under that banner. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as technical aspects alone go, it was lobbed the biggest soft-ball you could potentially throw an anime of its ilk. Doga Kobo has more or less proven that they can handle projects of this nature, and Tada-koi remained fairly consistent throughout its run in terms of overall polish. Unfortunately, as Yamazaki has proven with previous projects that he\u2019s been at the helm for, his direction is fairly orthodox. Tada-koi lacks any sense of personality as far as visual direction, which for a romantic comedy can dramatically affect its watchability. Doga typically saturates every frame with fun visual quirks to add to what would otherwise be a standard show. Take Himouto Umara-chan for instance, it was practically the only good thing about that show. Tada-koi didn\u2019t really hedge its bets on visual quirks as much as it relied on its cast of \u201ccharming\u201d characters to convey the \u201cCom\u201d in the \u201cRom\u201d. The only problem is that all of these characters are so trite and onenote that their gags never extracted much more than a shallow giggle from me.  \\n\\n\r\nTada and Teresa are really the only two characters worth expounding on, however let me try and sell you this laundry list of a supporting cast. There\u2019s the zany childhood friend (oooh that rascal, he\u2019s so funny! He even talks funny!), and he comes with his own stuck-up badass tsundere girl he\u2019s crushing on to seal the deal! Not much of a sell? Okay, how about the stern class president who\u2019s really an unspoken beauty, I\u2019ll even throw in that pervy ol\u2019 Senpai with the matching glasses to boot, you get the complete set! No? Alright, I didn\u2019t want have to pull this one out, but there\u2019s no way you\u2019re NOT gonna want the hunky foreign rival childhood friend character to absolutely trivialize the conflict! He\u2019s perfect in every way! ...No?...Feisty Imouto?...Did I mention there\u2019s a talking cat? The \u201csupporting\u201d cast couldn\u2019t even fill their roles properly, because that\u2019s just it, they were written to populate the show, not support the main characters like they were supposed to. \\n\\n\r\nI never really bought in to the fact that Tada was anything more than a normal guy because nothing in the show really lead me to believe that he was suffering from any form of \u201cemotional constipation\u201d. The impression I got was that his backstory was really just shoehorned in last second because they needed some way to arbitrarily develop his character when the time came. It was commendable to try and include some form of emotional complexity for the main protagonist, but since the show was more concerned with meandering along with a cookiecutter cast, it was a subplot that didn\u2019t amount to anything substantial. He did reasonably well filling the role of the straight man but I expected a lot more complexity out of the initial set-up of his characterization. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had little to say about Tada, I have even less to say about Teresa. Really her only defining character traits is that she\u2019s nice and she\u2019s bubbly. But as Hachiman Hikigaya once pointed out \u201cI hate nice girls, because they\u2019re nice to everyone and not just me.\u201d (I\u2019m sure I botched that quote, you don\u2019t have to tell me) Teresa and Tada really don\u2019t have that believable of chemistry at all. I contend with people that Tada could\u2019ve been any ol\u2019 Joe-Schmoe off the streets with the decency to help a foreigner out in their time of need, and Teresa probably would\u2019ve become smitten with them as well. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps my biggest grievance that I hold against this show\u2019s writing was how poorly it was paced. It didn\u2019t hit me until I got to the 11th episode where the two main characters in question were put in a date scenario seemingly out of nowhere. Tada and Teresa never interacted in that meaningful of a way up to that point which makes their chemistry as love interests come off as all the more forced. It\u2019s almost as if the staff realized this and made a mad-dash for the finish before anyone could notice. The last handful of episodes aside, none of the episodes particularly showcased any significant development between the main couple and was instead concerned with regurgitating dime-a-dozen slice of life antics, which would be fine if this series had a longer run. You can certainly pick and choose moments here and there however Tada-koi was so unconcerned with ACTIVELY and properly developing the relationship between it\u2019s two focal points, Tada and Teresa, that it halts the entire pacing of the show. \\n\\n\r\nBy design, \u201crom-coms\u201d tend to be the most predictable of anime so I hold execution and personability over most other criteria. Tada-koi was unfathomably disappointing in both regards.  Another drop in the bucket for mediocre seasonal rom-com anime. If reading this show\u2019s premise gives you the feeling that you have this show figured out...it\u2019s probably because you do. When the best character of your rom-com was a friggin cat, you know something\u2019s gone horribly awry. \\n",

I was very pleasantly surprised when even within the well tread genres of romantic comedies, this anime in terms of story, art and music actually pushed for something out of the norm.\r\nSince I first saw the trailer and till now(6th episode), the story line and character development has really been well done and I would definitely recommendthis anime to watch for anyone who loves light hearted rom-coms like me.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I really have to say this but this anime really reminds me of the movie Roman Holiday. Same princess running away to a foreign country, a photographer who does not know the story yet harbours the princess and then a short lived but powerful romance developing. I do not know how this story will end but I hope that this story has as powerful and emotional ending as Roman Holiday.",

            "content": "Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai might be the first anime review I've written in a while. First of all, I myself believe that the story has soo many potential to be developed IF the anime want to do more than 13 episodes. The anime had a potential to be that one of the anime with slow burns romance, filled with every day life and friendships. Kinda like the romcoms of western series, I think? But hey, I'm not saying on how they conclude the series is bad (i quite enjoyed it actually), but it's pity they took a 'mediocre' route instead of doing something new.\r\nTheart may be the very first reason why I watched the anime in the first place. It made me missed Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun so much :( and the atmosphere of the artwork is just peaceful and relaxing, which I really enjoyed. \\n\\n\r\nThe music and BGMs of the series is on-point but not quite memorable, they produced a music that made you want to sit back in a relaxing manner while probably enjoyed a hot chocolate on a rainy day while watching it. Again, like the artwork, it's peaceful and relaxing.\\n\\n\r\nI really like the characters actually?? They're pretty solid and some of them felt very 'real', like I could see my friends in them. An opinion, but I really like Ijuin's character. He's this character that made you want to smack his head but still want to gave him a hug or a simple pat on the shoulder. Much like I'd do to my real life best friends. \\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuus are the reasons I stayed though. Especially Tada's seiyuu which is Nakamura Yuuichi. Nakamura Yuuichi delivered a very great acting by becoming a simple high schooler, he somehow managed to bring Tada-kun to life. Tada is a very simple character and to see how Yuukyan executed him to life without being dramatic is just gorgeous. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a great anime for you guys who want to do some relaxing binge-watches at the end of the day (or semester, like me). Don't think about the storyline too much and I assured you, this could be one of the anime that could bring a smile to your face after a tiring day.",

            "content": "Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai is an original anime by Doga Kobo. And, for what it is, it's cute, but very cliche and predictable. \r\nIf you watched any amount of romance anime, k-dramas, or even western media, you could probably guess how the whole storyline plays out without even watching it. \r\n- Boy meets girl\r\n- Girl is incredibly good looking\r\n- She is also the new exchange student in boy's class\r\n-Couple bond together\r\n-Another person comes in to test the main couple\r\n- Circumstances pull them apart\r\n- Couple sits around and mops until one of them does something\r\n- Leading man crashes the wedding and pronounces his love forthe heroine\\n\r\n- Girl breaks off the bad engagement\\n\r\n- Couple gets back together. \\n\r\n-The end\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong. Having a predictable story isn't automatically a bad thing, since most stories about the journey not the destination and everything has been done before in some form or another. However, the other elements of the story are nothing to write home about either. \\n\\n\r\nThe two leads are charming and likeable, but needed more development. The side characters are charming, but nothing super special outside of Nyanko Big (the cat). I feel the side characters needed more focus as well.  \\n\\n\r\nAs others pointed out, the story doesn't do a fantastic job at selling the romance either. Tada acts stoic and warms up to our lead. Teresa acts bubbly, growing found of him. Outside of them spending time together and Tada kinda getting feelings for her later on, there isn't much else to it. The side romances are hardly explored. And the anime suffers for it. Audience investment is crucial for a story like this.\\n\\n\r\nThere are good things about this anime. The art and sound direction are good. None of the characters annoyed me. I found the episode told in Nyanko Big's POV funny. I love the OP. I give the anime credit for not making Charles, the rival love interest, evil or unlikable like what often happens in stories like this. \\n\\n\r\nOver all, like I said before, it's just a cute anime. Nothing more. And there are far better romance anime out there that I could recommend over this one. \\n\\n\r\n(As a side note, there's no English dub for this. Only the subs. Just as a heads up if anyone needs to know that) \\n\\n\r\nStory: 5 \\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nOverall: 5 \\n",

            "content": "Tada-kun never fall in love?????????Well, he just did right now, I mean fall in love.....Did you ever watch something where it has a lotta parts that were a total mismatched, that you wonder as to why did I ever watched this thing. So let's discuss some of them, story, it was practically cliche , when a girl is in love with someone but was engage to another, but the twist here was that the guy whom she loves was this totally oblivious guy who never knew how much he loves her until it's too late and in some favorable circumstances he was able to havea happily ever after. On the character category  Tada Mitsuyoshi a cliche MC who is oblivious to the girls around him who may have some feeling around and we're talking about the one who goes by the name Teresa of Larsenberg aka Teresa Wagner who name doesn't even sound like Dutch, she on the other hand plays this character being a rock on a hard place where she is already engage but still find the time to cheat on her soon to be husband by having a crush on the MC, IMAO she should have had her sidekick/bodyguard bitch name, Alexandra Margritte, who on the other hand look too odd to even be the same age as Teresa and let alone having to be a high school, I guess you can say that her character and role was a total out of place , in fact studio Doga Kobo should have placed her as Teresa's besty rather than being this sidekick who has a grown-up's job of being a bodyguard, Injuin Kaoru's character borderlines  from being Tada's besty to being gay  in competing for Tada's affection, geez his flamboyan self of being a selfie addict was rather annoying. On Pin Semapi's (Sugimoto Hajime) character, I just don't get as to why Alex and Charles were the only one to notice that Pin sempai's idol Hina and Hinako Hasegawa were just one and the same, basically here Pin sempai is the very definition of stupid for not being able to notice and for not saying what he want's to say to his idol Hina when he had the chance.....which brings us to Hinako Hasegawa, where I find rather stupid that she wasn't in the same year level as Pin Semapi given that they're childhood friends. Charles de Lorie , to me was the lolicon here cu' she marring a girl who is not yet of legal age and even falling for one who was just too young for him unless stdio Doga Kobo had taken the initiative to make Alex to be in her 20's , which they didn't, SHIT.  \\n\r\nYamashita Kentarou's character of being this masochistic kohai errand guy was just too unnecessary, but then again he does make a good love interest for Tada's kid sister Tada Yui, Nyako Big was more like the only antagonist around here despite of being a cat but, damn it, he only attacks that selfie addict and that masochist kohai.....and another thing does anybody ever notices that the quite guy that show up in the cafe is the star of  Rainbow Shougun. Cu'z he does look like one, too bad they didn't even made any revelation about him. If one would ask as to how much I enjoy this anime, I'd say half of me do, given that it does have some rom comin it, but half of me doesn't, given the mismatches around with the setting , character's role and the fact that the MC only fell in love with the girl on the latter part of the girl's marriage to his bothorne husband IMAO they should have titled this as \"Tada-Kun falls in love in a hopeless place\", Also the fact the Tada loses Teresa in the end would have given this anime a more unique perspective  rather than giving him a kind of favourable circumstance where he gets to have a 2nd chance with Teresa where they get to have a happy ever after. So my ratings :\\n\\n\r\nStory-Mediocre 5: The story plot was just a cliche. \\n\\n\r\nArt-Decent 4: No fan services around. \\n\\n\r\nSound- fair 6: Cu'z I rate it so.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Poor 3: Characters here can be describe as a bunch of ill-fitted parts that were forced together with a lotta duct tape.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- fair 6: Half of me enjoys it even in involves  a rom com  , half of me just finds it shitty when them characters were too stupid to even notice what's in front of them. Also I kinda hate it when them studio Doga Kobo and the director, would substitute the country from Larsenberg instead of Luxembourg, now c'mon, the country itself is a public domain,they can use it without any repercussion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Good 7: Good but not very good, like I've said they should have just end it with Tada not getting Teresa at all, since he does deserve to lose her in the 1st place , in fact this should never be titled as \"Tada-kun Never Falls in Love\" rather it should have been titled as \"Tada-kun falls in Love in a hopeless Place\". \\n\\n\r\nThey found love in a hopeless place, they found love in a hooopless place\\n\r\n                                                                                            Rianna.     \\n\\n",

I'm still missing the last episode but this is what i have so far.\r\nSTART\r\nTada-kun wa koi wo shinai feels like a romance story that is out of this period where normally love stories go the same rout as every other one.\r\nthe story doesnt feel like any other one, it feels special as in anime because it havent been done in the same way as other romance shows out there.\r\nArtstyle of the series is amazing and the scenery is beautiful cant find better in others than films and realy well animated series like 3-gatsu no lion.\\n\\n\r\nthe opening is amazing and so is the ending of the episodes the op makes you feel excited and the ending makes you feel like there is somewhere that they gona take you feeling of the Feel train that passed by me when i started watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nsome of the side characters might feel generic but it doesnt make the anime bad at all because the main characters fills the empty hole that the side characters bring by making them part of the story some way or another\\n\\n\r\nover all i would say the anime is worth to watch after i finish the last episode cant say anything else perfect anime for my taste.",

            "content": "Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai is an original anime by Doga Kobo and to be honest dosen't live upto its name. I'm not going to give a detailed review on this one because in my opinion it is not worth it. This review contains the plot in detail though I won't call those spoilers as you will anyway guess every inch of it when you start watching this series.\r\nNothing could be expected about the story because this is an 'ORIGINAL' anime. The originality of this anime astounds me. A protagonist who lost his parents in an accident meets a foreign princess who has come abroadto study in his school along with Miss Helper who is also posing as a transfer student. Then prince charming comes to Japan for his princess and the protagonist wins her heart against him. Oh and there is also another guy who can't identify his childhood friend he sees everyday without her glasses and falls in love with the non-spectacle version of her. These traditional characters are knitted together using photography which everyone except the protagonist does for fun. I can't seem to find why there is a comedy tag on this anime just like the misleading title. \"Tada-kun has Never Tasted Love\" is a much better series and would have helped judge the cliche story line before this even came out. This anime however dosen't stray away from the focus on the relationships among the not so new characters but these relationships are also in no way new to the anime community.\\n\r\nI rate this series an overall 4/10 as it is watchable however is just a mix up of other anime which are again mix ups of older anime.",

            "content": "If you are wondering wether you should watch this show, the most important question you should ask yourself is: am I a hopeless, sappy romantic? If you're like me and your answer to this question is: yes, definately, then this show might just be the thing for you.\r\nThis show isn't particularly original, and I get the feeling that it really does not try to be, which I think is perfectly fine. There are many anime that try so hard to be different, that they are forgetting about the most important thing of all: entertainment. But as I am really not trying to start a discussionon that subject, I'll just move on to my actual review for this show.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nLike I mentioned above, this show is definately not the most original. The same can be said about the story. It basically is your typical boy meets girl (or the other way around) kinda setting. Naturally, our main couple need several episodes to get to know each other, and they both have an interesting background, which influences their relationship greatly. I didn't mind the slower pacing of the show, But I can imagine there will be people that do. In the end, I got exactly what I expected, storywise, and I don't really think that's a bad thing, as I generally don't watch anime to be surprised, but to be entertained, and in this particular genre, to satisfy the part of my soul that used to belong to a young maiden, experiencing love for the first time. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nI don't actually have a strong opinion on the art in this anime. I appreciate that it's not overly cutesy, but it is not special in any way. It get's the job done though. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is well chosen in my opinion. In these types of shows, the soundtrack really needs to support the emotion, conveyed in any given scene. I find that in sappy romantic shows like this one, a simple piano melody is often enough to strengthen the feels, coming at you from every direction. In my case, when I really notice a soundtrack, it's either really good or really bad. In this show, the music did exactly what it needed to do.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nAnd now we're getting to the good part. The characters in this show start out to be the same as the characters in all the other romance shows you know and love, with one exception: Tada-kun himself. If there is one thing I absolutely hate in romance anime, it's a main character that is an awkward mess, get's beaten to a pulp by the heroine for walking in on her while she's changing, and just can't decide which of the dozen dropdead gorgeous girls that surround him is most worthy of his attention. Not because he want to bang them all, mind you, but because he just thinks they are all swell people and he doesn't want to hurt anyone. If I want to watch someone hopelessly ruin his lovelife by being an indecisive idiot, I'd just recap my own sad disasters that I call \"relationships\". Tada is a hard working, down to earth kinda guy, and that is why I like him. The main heroine is of the basic airhead variety, untill you find out later that there is actually way more to her than that. But the one who really stood out to me was dear, sweet Kaoru-kun. After watching the first episode, I absolutely hated this guy. He was just plain annoying. But after finishing the show, he actually came close to being my favorite character on the show. That's what decent character development can do for you. I would have loved for some of the other characters to have been given more attention, but I'm just happy that they gave decent screentime to characters other than the main couple. The whole duration of the show, I was nervously waiting for the evil, underhanded other love rival (either male or female) to come along and ruin the cast, but in the end, they never came.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nLike I said at the beginning, if you are like me, and you have a giddy middle school girl hidden away in your heart somewhere, chances are you are gonna like this show. It tries to give you a lovely romance, with a bit of comedy and drama, and it does exactly that. The supporting cast is balanced, the dramatic parts are well written and the main characters are likeable. One last bit of critique at the very end, would be that the comedic relieve sometimes just doesn't work. the show excels in the dramatic parts and if you want to watch a great comedy, you should probably be reading some Gintama reviews or something. This show tugs on your heartstrings in several ways, and if you're the type of person who like shows like that, I suggest you give this one a chance. \\n\\n\r\nI tried to keep this review short and probably failed miserably. My closing argument for liking this show is that I knew exactly what I was getting into when I started it, end it just did not disappoint. If you actually took the time to read my opinion on this show, I am very grateful to you, and if it convinced you to give this show a try, then it was definately worth writing it.",

It really isn't, I walked in expecting this basic romance story and that is exactly what I got. \r\nNow that doesn't mean the anime was bad, if anything I actually suggest watching it. I'm someone who enjoys romance stories, I've watched a few here and there... yea, just a few.\r\nThis one was different yet the same. I'm someone who likes the plain everyday MCs, it's who I connect the most with. Though, I felt something different from this MC that I didn't from others, be it Toradora, Angel Beats, Anohana, etc. \r\nI guess I felt he was larger than me.A common theme is the MC facing their fears and overcoming the differences between them to become a pair. \\n\\n\r\nIt's told to you early on what is going to happen and I loved it. I knew from like episode 1 or 2 what was going to happen at the end of the story and how it would get there. Half because it is your basic ordinary story and half because foreshadowing. \\n\\n\r\nA story based on fear and regrets, common.\\n\r\nA character base riddled with mundane characters, common.\\n\r\nThe sound, common.\\n\r\nThe art style, bit above average.\\n\\n\r\nSo why 6?\\n\\n\r\nI'll reiterate my point of the MC feeling bigger than me. I connect with him because I understand the final emotions. I resonate with his foley and find myself enthralled with the actions. \\n\\n\r\nCan you face your fears of the unknown to speak your mind to the one you love?\\n\r\nCan you fly to a place you never been to, a place of strangers for the person you love?\\n\r\nCan you actually admit your learn from your regrets?\\n\\n\r\nI can safely say, No.\\n\\n\r\nThat's why I always connect with these MCs, he did what I couldn't.

Yet, you still like that bouquet enough to keep it on your desk.\r\nTada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai was a rather great to start show. Completely predictable, but great to start, just like that bouquet of silk and wraps.\r\nWhere haven't we all meet a story about an someone coming to Japan, fall in love with a Japanese before? Well,I haven't seen that many romances, on screen and in real life, but I have seen enough of such stories. And yes, it was predictable. I was able to find out a key plot in 1 episode and even figured out the ending from episode 10. I'm not trying to boast, but it was that predictable. All that is to not mention all those hints you get from the start of story with so many other pairing and their own stories. In fact, it is exactly because of how predictable it was, the series was actually enjoyable for once.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it still manages to start off beautifully enough to have me kept on watching. And by beautiful, I mean the work on visual and sound/music was excellent. It sure did paint the whole series in the color of love, a faint pink like, yet some what green and purple, all the while manages to hide some very hard to see red, blue, black and even white mixture of color. Although not exactly it, it still has enough to make up for a rainbow. I myself think this is why the plot is so centered on rainbow. Despite my liking on it, the over all pink-ish color was actually not all that good, all thing considered.\\n\\n\r\nYes, that pink-ish color is too perfect that it went too far from my common sense. Especially, that one character: Charles - the best nice guy you can find out there. While the rest of characters, considering their screen time, all have something unique to them, Charles is only a nice guy. From start, to the end. Even in before the start, he was a nice guy. So much I gave a whole 3 more points just for him in character category. He gave up a lot, even for a nice guy. In fact, I started to think that he was actually a coward and wanted a way out of everything by giving up. So, in a sense, Charles was the best character in the series in my opinion, considering what back story he might have.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about back stories, we still don't know what most other pairings since the whole thing was very rushed. Which, is a shame, since this kind of story line fits for a slower development. There are also scenes I don't remember seeing among flashbacks so I actually thought it was originally a novel or Manga adaptation right then and there.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, \\n\r\n- Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai was a rather great series at start, but was rushed and written with so many cliche development.\\n\r\n- However, it still hits on what the viewers want to see to land on safe zone, time and time again. Considering how many chances it got.\\n\r\n- After all is seen and talked, it was a fair series to enjoy. But not enough to actually like it.",

It\u2019s ridiculous in many ways but it's not always clear whether that's intentional.\r\nDespite being a slice of life, the story it tells has a very clearstart and finish, though it does leave some loose ends.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as school-romance anime goes, this is actually pretty good and I hope this is the direction the genre combination is going, but I would still only recommend it if you've already watched a lot of anime and just want something that's not terrible.",

But after that you must be realize that those feelings are things that affect human most. Because they are .. Feeling.\r\nThis anime show us what it means for us as a human that have so much feeling while we living our life. In here, the protagonist of the story is started his story with deep sadness, and then as the time goes he feels morefeeling, like happiness, friendship, daily routine, and love. Even though after he feels all those feeling, that sadness that he feel so deeply is never forgotten. He know that from that sadness he found a point where it can be declare like this.\\n\\n\r\n\"If you can go back in time where you can make up your regret isn't it great?\"\\n\r\n\"But you can't\"\\n\r\n\"Isn't preventing repetition of the same regret better?\"\\n\\n\r\nThese three statement hit me hard, it is true. I don't know if some of you also think the same way as the statement but for me its something new about how we should responsible against our regret. And thats what the makes the show great. \\n\\n\r\nBut beside that the rest of the show is kind of mediocre. Let me explain it.\\n\r\nThe story and the character, to be fair it feels so mediocre. But its mediocre in good way and not in the bad way, so it is still fun to watch.\\n\r\nThe art is smooth, it suit the anime so well.\\n\r\nThe sound, ahh this one, I really love the sound in this anime, especially the piano soundtrack. I really really love it, it suit the atmosphere of the show so well. \\n\r\nPS : if someone know the anime that have same atmosphere as Tada-kun (i know there is i had watched it but forget what it is) with same melody like soundtrack in this anime, tell me!\\n\r\nYou found this review helpful.",

            "content": "Alongside moe and action shonen, romance is probably the most oversaturated genre next to them, to the point that you could very well make a drinking game out of every example of these genres, pointing out the various tropes as they come out.\u00a0 But sometimes you get examples where those tropes aren't necessarily a bad thing.\u00a0 As such, we have Takakoi, a pretty box standard romance that wouldn't be the same without them.\r\nStory:\r\nOur story of Tadakoi starts with Mitsuyoshi Tada, a boy with an interest in photography who on one faithful encounter (there's one shot) meets an airheaded foreigner and guides her around to makesure she doesn't get lost in a foreign land.\u00a0 A rainstorm and hiding from said rain scene later (there's another shot), it turns out that this foreigner is a new transfer student named Teresa Wagner, who, along with her 'friend' Alec Magritte is also Tada's new neighbor.\u00a0 What a coincidence.\\n\\n\r\nTadakoi's storytelling and plot structure is nothing new.\u00a0 Much of the series follows around the photography club, with extra emphasis on Tada and Teresa as the two slowly grow closer as the series progresses, leading to what you would probably expect after reading the synopsis and how much of a lie the title 'Tada-kun Never Falls in Love' is for the series.\u00a0 Now that may seem like this series has no actual merit to it, as rehashing typical tropes in a story that's your standard crush to confession story, but that's only mostly the case here.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, the show establishes information for our main characters very early own, making a really solid baseline that stays with the series for the rest of its runtime.\u00a0 This one thing does wonders for the series, as it provides really good background and actually validates the romance to happen more so than just throwing characters together because 'this HAS to be a romance'.\u00a0 Not only that, but the series is free from any melodrama, a trap that many romance-based shows fall to in order to create tension and more serious moments.\u00a0 Tadakoi has hardly if any at all, making the more serious parts of the series more somber by comparison, and actually makes them pop out more because in doing so, the gravity of the situation becomes all the more apparent this way.\\n\\n\r\nHowever despite that, Tadakoi has numerous plot threads that don't actually get touched upon as much as they should.\u00a0 Both Teresa and Tada get the brunt of the screentime, leaving the rest of the cast and their subplots to get pushed to the side and/or not resolved.\u00a0 At most, the side cast gets one episode to devote to their love story, but that's about it, and it doesn't really go very far.\u00a0 While it doesn't intrude on the main story, it's one of those things that personally irked me because despite the satisfaction of the ending, I couldn't help but think the show had most of its plot threads unfinished, and that from a critical perspective is criminal, especially since they each had just as much potential to blossom into a story as much as Tadakoi did.\u00a0 (Though in that sense, time constraints would be a problem.)\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Tadakoi is overall a pretty average show that despite the 'average' description, sticks to its guns based with tropes that without, would've made the show crash and burn heavily.\u00a0 It's a non-intrusive entry into the school romance genre, bearing some heavy elements without going full-on melodrama, mixed in with comedy to create a typically airy and bright atmosphere that was a joy to watch.\u00a0 Loose plot threads are a bother, but the impact they have towards the series overall is minimal in the grand scheme of things.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Great tone throughout\\n\r\n+ Uses tropes effectively\\n\r\n+ No melodrama\\n\r\n- Subplot threads are shaky at best\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAnother bit of praise that Tadakoi deserves is in its cast.\u00a0 Specifically, how difficult I find it is to actually dislike any member of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nMitsuyoshi Tada is our typically stoic protagonist with a passion for photography.\u00a0 While he showcases more 'emotionless' traits than your typical romance protagonist, Tada is a remarkably interesting choice, as mentioned earlier, his backstory and reason for being come early on, and we get the scope of what kind of person he is from the very start.\u00a0 This contributes much to his growth as a character, as his change catalyzes the climax that greatly validates the usage of that specific trope.\u00a0 He's also not a dense motherfucker, and for a romance protagonist in any stretch of the imagination, that is a major plus.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Teresa, the more airheaded of the two who always wears a smile on her face and is obsessed with the 'Rainbow Shogun', a tv show figure that considers 'rainbow' as a color of the rainbow.\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 From the start, it's clear that there's more to Teresa than meets the eye, which in typical anime fashion, gets revealed at the very end of the series to no one's surprise cause the signs are pretty obvious from just watching the show casually.\u00a0 Nevertheless, just like Tada, Teresa gets some immediate backstory early on that helps with giving her the necessary depth to carry on through the series.\u00a0 I mostly focus on this aspect because of their characters because it's really the penultimate reason to why the second half of the show happens in the first place.\u00a0 There's an escalation within this show that really bolsters the show's themes of \"Do, don't regret\" that not only came out of left field, but made the show so much better than it could've been.\\n\\n\r\nThe side cast consists mostly of Tada and Teresa's friends: Pin-senpai, Yamashita, Hasegawa, Alec, and Ijuuin, as well as some more lesser used characters like Tada's little sister, Nyanko Big, a cat primarily used for gags, and Charles, who shows up later in the series.\u00a0 The common theme for these characters is the fact that it's very difficult to find a reason to hate any of them.\u00a0 Any negative traits a character may have is played off for laughs, and even then, their positive ones show themselves in spades, which is not only impressive, but makes the show more enjoyable cause it's a cast of characters that you don't want to hate.\u00a0 I want to give special attention to Ijuuin and Charles though, as the show really could've easily gone the annoying best friend and super intense love rival route for the two, which really could've been possible, but instead opted for a really good best friend and respectable love rival that again, makes it really hard to make you hate them because they contribute more than they take away.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Main duo carries development with them throughout the series\\n\r\n+ Side cast are all great characters\\n\r\n+ Better opted routes for some characters than they could've been\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nProduced by Doga Kobo, the art for Tadakoi is bright, colorful, and very 'cute', at least with Teresa's design.\u00a0 (As expected of a company who primarily makes slice of life.)\u00a0 The company's track record may not really stand out, but if there's one thing they're really good at, it's consistency.\u00a0 Tadakoi has very consistent artwork and key frames/character models hardly look different from scene to scene and make everything look very seamless.\\n\\n\r\nI'm also a big fan at the fact that the show rarely uses the more typical 'exaggerated faces' or any form of the trope to establish comedy.\u00a0 Much of the comedy happens within the typical style of the show, and I find that to be a positive trait due to the current over-reliance on stuff like that in typical comedy series'.\u00a0 Backgrounds are also privy to this benefit, as much of the show is very picturesque, fitting well with the show's photography theme.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Consistent artwork\\n\r\n+ Very colorful and pleasing to look at\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I find the OP to be better than its ED counterpart.\u00a0\u00a0Masayoshi Ooishi's \"Otomodachi Film\" is a very upbeat and catchy song that captures your attention the moment the song starts.\u00a0 It sort of leads you into what to expect with Tadakoi, which is nice considering for this show, what you have on the box is what you're going to get.\u00a0 By comparison though, \"Love Song\" is a seiyuu song sung by Teresa's VA, which by comparison isn't all that impressive, as it's a slow song with not many memorable qualities about it.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\n\"You get what you get\".\u00a0 I think that's about the easiest way to explain Tadakoi.\u00a0 As the show is a road to confession story, just the mention of that plotline alone creates a simple roadmap that one who's seen enough shows of this nature can discern what can happen without even really watching the show.\u00a0 Its reliance on tropes only bolsters this fact.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, personally I don't find that to be a bad thing.\u00a0 In a landscape where consumers try to find the 'next big thing', and tropes and lack of originality are seen as the devil as the phrase \"We've seen it a million times\" is thrown around casually, I actually welcomed Tadakoi for being a show that for all intents and purposes, just wanted to entertain with a sweet and simple romance that, while cliched, did at least follow through with what it set out to do in terms of the main couple.\u00a0 Yes, there are glaring issues elsewhere, but that didn't really bother me too much.\u00a0 This is mostly because personally, I have a livid hate for melodrama.\u00a0 I've seen so many romance shows crash and burn at the mere existence of the term, and seeing a confession love story NOT have that was more than I could've ever asked for.\u00a0 So yes, I did enjoy this, even if it wasn't that amazing of a show critically.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a very casual romance, this is a pretty safe bet to take.\u00a0 Tadakoi has absolutely nothing intrusive about it and I actually found it to be a nice breather to watch week after week given some of the contents in my list.\u00a0 Though I do wonder of the socioeconomic impact the decision made at the very end will have, but that's not really my concern.\u00a0 Seriously though, as much of a pure 'average' this show has tacked onto it, that's not really a bad thing.\u00a0 Lacking originality, sure, but personally I'm sick and tired of shows trying to be 'original', seeing what the end results can become by that logic.",

            "content": "Gee, this show is called Tada Never Falls in Love and has \"Romance\" in the tags. I wonder what will happen in this romance anime called Tada Never Falls in Love. Can you guess it? I sure as hell can't, my buddies! I would say this review contains spoilers, but... I think you would probably know most of what happens in this show even if I didn't spoil you, but here's the warning anyway.\r\nApparently, Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai was somewhat anticipated before coming out because it's made by Doga Kobo, the same studio with the same staff that gave us Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. Now,I haven't watched Nozaki-kun, I don't know what that show is about or if it's any good, but I know people like it and expected Tada-kun to be on the same vein, and judging by how lukewarm the reception to this one was, I assume it didn't quite hit the mark. I'm saying this just so you know that I'm not judging Tada-kun by how it compares to Nozaki-kun or anything like that, especially because I think it's pretty unfair to judge a show by how it compares to another instead of viewing it as its own thing. Sure, you can make comparisons to prove some points and whatnot, but if you're basing your criticisms mostly on that, you're not really giving the show a fair chance, are you? Well, it's not like Tada-kun is the most original show ever anyway, but that doesn't mean it can't be good despite not being exactly original or groundbreaking, Boku no Hero Academia isn't exactly the most original shounen ever, but it's still a pretty good watch because it executes its shounen tropes and clich\u00e9s very well. So, is Tada-kun a good show in that sense? Well... Kinda. It has some great production values and looks gorgeous, most Doga Kobo shows I watched do, the background art is very well-made and the animations are incredibly smooth, though the characters don't look exactly unique, but they look good enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is Tada Mitsuyoshi, a japanese high school student who is a member of his school's Photography Club and aspires to be a photographer like his father was, Tada has never known love before. One certain day, Tada was taking some pics of the cherry blossoms for the club, but some dumb blonde bitch who's probably a gaijin was getting in the way of his pics and Tada was about to tell her to fuck off back to Sweden, but then the girl turned around and she actually looks cute, so it's alright, cute girls can stay in our glorious nippon lands. In this exact moment when Tada meets the foreign girl, the screen gets covered in a pink filter as cherry blossoms float around, which means the title of the show should have been Tada Takes A Minute to Fall in Love. Anyway, the girl asks Tada to take some pictures of her, he ends up taking with his own camera because her camera's battery died or whatever. The girl's name is Teresa Wagner, she's a foreigner from European country called Larsenburg, Teresa likes Japan a lot and is particularly a big fan of a japanese samurai-themed TV show called Rainbow Shogun, she just arrived in Japan and got separated from her travelling companion, so Tada lends her a hand and takes her to the Tada Cafe where he works together with his grandpa and his sister Yui. Fortunately, and conveniently, the hotel where Teresa will stay with her companion is right next to Tada's family cafe, also Teresa's companion is a redhead chick called Alexandra Magritte, but better known as Alec, who was worried sick and takes care of her, to the point of beating up one of Tada's friends because she misunderstood him as a creepy dude who was trying to make some moves on Teresa. Can you guess who Teresa could possibly be? I can't for the life of me, man...\\n\\n\r\nTurns out Teresa and Alec are transfer students in Tada's school, and they end up joining the Photography Club as well. Most of the other main characters are also members of the club and they all follow some typical anime tropes: There's Ijuin Kaoru, the goofy hyperactive narcisist who's popular with girls, the president of the club, Sugimoto Hajime or Pin-senpai, who's a perverted third year student that's way into photographing nude girls and has an obsession with a gravure idol called Hina, Yamashita Kentarou, a first year student behaves like a dog for some reason, and then there's Hasegawa Hinako who's a bit of a quiet glasses girl and looks an awful lot like Hina... I wonder why Hinako looks like Hina. Can you guess it? Alright, that joke has gotten annoying now, I'll stop. Not that Tada, Teresa and Alec don't follow some anime tropes as well, Tada is your typical stoic protagonist, Teresa is the friendly childish girl and Alec is a bit of a tsundere, in fact none of the characters from Tada-kun is exactly original by any means, it doesn't help much that most of them don't get much development and don't show many character traits besides the ones you've seen since the beginning, but... I actually like Tada-kun's cast, at least most of it. I don't really care much for Yamashita Dog, Pin-senpai and Hinako, they don't really develop much, most of their scenes are typical hit-and-miss anime comedy, there's like, one episode dedicated to Pin-senpai and Hinako, also another one that shows Yui has a crush on Yamashita, but then the show never really bothers to explore these characters' relationships more, so I feel it was kind of a waste, I think Nyanko Big, Tada's cat, has a better romance arc than most of the characters this show wastes no time with starting to ship, which is weird. Being a slice of life, Tada-kun doesn't have much of a plot, it's just the Photography Club doing their club activities while Tada and Teresa get closer to each other and occasionally we get some focus on other characters, the pacing is not very good because there's a few episodes where nothing really happens when it comes to the characters and their relationships, and obviously there's no way to effectively develop many love couples in a 13 episode anime. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Tada-kun would benefit to have more moments when other characters stop playing their anime trope for the sake of comedy, I feel this show really does a good job at making them likeable when it shows other sides of characters such as Ijuin and Alec. At first, I found Ijuin to be annoying because he's even the type of real-life person I wouldn't get along with at all, he's loud, hyperactive, he overreacts to stuff, loves taking pictures of himself and talking about himself, he constantly provokes Alec into beating him up, etc. But then one episode about him hosting a \"show\" of his own where he treats everyone else from the club with whatever they like to eat, showed that behind Ijuin's silly behavior, there's a great guy who deeply cares for his friend and pulls all this goofy act up just to amuse him and the others, he got moved by the fact that Tada's parents died and has been trying his best to cheer Tada up even nowadays when he's pretty alright, he still does it every year just so Tada and his other friends can have some fun. Now this is how you write a good comic relief character, people, I love it when this type of character gets their chance to show that they're more than just a a way to inject some comedy into the show, it makes me sympathize with them and even tolerate their silly moments, and Ijuin actually has quite a handful of serious moments where he's shown to be a very good friend, I didn't expect him of all people to be my favorite character in this show. Alec is also pretty cute when she's not playing the typical tsundere role with Ijuin, although she can get a bit overly dramatic at times when something happens to Teresa, I think it makes sense because she's not very good at expressing or controlling her feelings and cares a lot for Teresa's well-being, she's an alright character, I actually prefer her to Teresa, who's honestly kinda bland, but not unlikeable at least. Tada is also an alright character, he gets some development as he starts to realize his own feelings for Teresa, he has an internal conflict with that due to his backstory and the fact that Teresa will have to return to her country someday and his interactions with Ijuin are some quality bro shit, for a stoic anime protagonist I found him pretty easy to like compared to a lot of the others.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also a new character that gets introduced in the second half of the show, Charles de Loire, a descendant of French nobility who's later revealed to be secretly Teresa's fiance, and you'd probably think this show would turn into a shitty love triangle drama where the main character has to dispute the girl with some douchebag the writers clearly want you to hate. Surprisingly, it doesn't go that route! I mean, sure, there's a lot of drama in later episodes, but not because of Charles being a romantic rival to Tada, he's a pretty chill dude who befriends even Tada quickly and never really tries to ruin his relationship with Teresa or anything, although he does genuinely love Teresa and is unaware that Alec has a crush on him. I would go as far as saying Charles is the true hero of this series, because if it wasn't for him, we would have gotten a much less predictable bittersweet ending.\\n\\n\r\n... Well, when I put it like that, it makes Charles look like a character who just made the show more generic since the ending is exactly what I and everyone else were expecting it to be, but whatever, Charles is still a nice character for what this show is. Also, I don't really get the whole deal with Rainbow Shogun, this series dedicate a lot of screen time to this show and I don't really understand why, the rainbow color joke thing was funny the first time around, but not after it was repeated for the 20th time... Is there some deeper meaning to this? Is it just a running gag in the series? I don't know, maybe Rainbow Shogun is 2deep4me.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I think you'll probably know what route Tada-kun takes and what kind of ending it will have by the time you're starting to watch the second half, it's awfully predictable and by-the-numbers, but it's not a bad anime, I didn't even have high expectations for it to begin with and got pleasantly surprised by how much I ended up liking some of its characters. I expected Tada-kun to be a nice little slice of life anime with bits of romance and comedy, and I got exactly what I expected, even if the writing is not exactly the greatest and it plays too safe for its own good, it was still enjoyable for what it was and the second half tackled the theme of regret over missed opportunities rather well. There's quite a handful of things to like about Tada-kun, depending on your expectations, your tolerance for clich\u00e9s and predictable plot elements, you may even enjoy this show even more than I did, I would recommend giving at least the first three episodes a shot.",

            "content": "Every season has a warm slice of life anime and tada kun koi wa shinai is this season's soothing romance with a dash of comedy. Before it even aired i had lots of expectations. The summary sounded like it will be something new in contrast to regular romcoms. Granted it had an array of beautiful scenery, nice art and the animation is lovely.\r\nBut the title was as deceptive as the ending was predictably boring. While i had reservations regarding every episode as intensively childish, i had more such on the ending alone. I am still trying to wrap my mind around the conveniently ridiculousidea of how a princess of a small country goes off to japan with just a secretary and no guards? Her family like every other family in anime turned a blind eye to it because you either die or live to be invisible NPCs and are considered lucky to get a special mention. She randomly enrolled in a school which as per rules shall not verify the background of transfer students and gave the sole right of finding the secret to the hero/love interest. Being someone who watches anime, i have a watched a reasonable number of animus and it is baffled me when i see theresa knew only of \"rainbow shogun\" and for what it was worth, was insanely cheesy. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately there was no chemistry between Theresa and tada whatsoever. How could there be? Tada the quiet photograpy nerd was was too busy dwelling in his sad backstory to actually notice a girl much less fall in love. He was notoriously in need of the female interest to bring light to his soul.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime had some really funny romance in it. It went like this: Alec likes Charles , Charles likes Theresa,Theresa likes tada and apparently tada likes Theresa too. If you thought franxx was corny wait until you watch tada kun. \\n\\n\r\nI felt really sorry for Alec and Charles though. Even if he did let Theresa go there was no way he would pick Alec and sadly it should have been Alec and tada who were heart broken. Thanks to shoujo anime rule no 1- even if the MCs have no feelings for each other they will be forced to come together. \\n\\n\r\nWhen tada 'realized' his love for Theresa- whatever triggered it and went to the tiny nation, i was inwardly worried for the fate of this anime. i knew how it will go down.  \\n\r\nAnime logic is irrefutable as it glamours over the fact that tada and Theresa had been acquainted for not more than 2 seasons. \\n\r\nToo bad Charles buckled. tada might have fought his fear and flown to Theresa. He might have battled against water current to retrieve the invite. He might have even mustered the courage to confess to an engaged princess. It still was not fair to Charles who had to give her up because the plot made him to do so. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot was nothing far from ordinary with some outdoorsy activity and majority of which was cat chasing and photography. This anime had a cliched character line up. It was a cocktail of a brooding hero, a perverted and clueless senpai, one i look dowdy on outside but am foxy on the inside secret idol girl, a cute self obsessed best friend and a cat. Now the cat seemed to have hit it big. Add to this one cheerful but plain foreigner, a red head and a hot tall handsome guy. And the drink you get is \"tada kun can fall in love\"\\n\\n\r\nWhat needed an explanation was why the hell does tada speak in Japanese to the castle guards? Even ijjuin uses english broken or otherwise.",

Anyways, in terms of individuality or what i think that is unique to the show,i don't think there is much. I always thought the cast of characters was your average dumb anime cast, who always were oblivious to crucial plot points. I always thought the plot was so obvious that i could see the ending from episode one. though i cant say any spoilers i will say that it is painfully obvious right from the beginning what the main characters alter egos are. \\n\\n\\n\r\non the other hand the art and sound look fabulous. compared to other slice of life/ romance shows i have seen this one appears to have a much higher budget. it also has a really good and catchy opening that i would dumb sometimes. most of the time I skip intros, but this time i didn't most of the time. \\n\\n\\n\r\nin terms of enjoyment while i shouldn't say that i should like it about a 6 or 5 i do decently like it kind of as a guilty pleasure. but, i do see where other people are coming from. this show is laughably predictable and average, and i know i said that it isn't that cliche compared to other shows, it still is very cliche. 6/10 better then average due to sound and looks but painfully average on story and character.\\n",

            "content": "Story (4/10):\r\nFor me, the CONCEPT of what Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai is supposed to be (ie: a story about a teenager that never falls in love suddenly falling in love) was what had me interested in this show from the start. Unfortunately, I think it takes far too long to reach the point. It focuses on it a bit in the beginning, but as you continue watching it just seems to be about a group of friends more than a love story. While I have no problem with that either, I didn't start watching this because I wanted to see a story about friendships.Friendship is important even in a romance anime, but this just seems to be 95% friendship, 5% romance. I did only watch 4 episodes so I don't know if this improves later on, but I gave it a good 4 episode watch like I always do and I wasn't impressed.\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe art itself isn't that bad. It's appealing to look at while not being anything overly special. Hence giving it one more point better than mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nSound (3/10):\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest I wasn't interested in the op or the ed. I don't even recall music in the actual anime itself that's how irrelevant it was to me. I can't say it was bad, but it wasn't anything I cared about or remember as important.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves weren't horrible, but they were stereotypical and not very interesting to me. I didn't remember most of their names and I just found myself not being attracted to any of them. As someone who usually connects to characters in a matter of moments, this wasn't a good sign for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4/10):\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I didn't even make it all the way through the fourth episode. I just marked myself as watching it because I watched half of it. It just seemed so... slow paced. I know slice of life shows are usually slow paced, but this one was in a way that I couldn't stand. I just found myself not enjoying it enough to get through the entire episode, but not enough to give it anything lower than a 4.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (5/10):\\n\\n\r\nMaybe it just wasn't my anime. Other people may enjoy it more than I did, but I still personally wouldn't recommend Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai to anyone who was interested in watching it. I really wanted to stand behind it, to hope that it would eventually get back to the point, but it didn't seem that way. I'm disappointed this one didn't turn out how I thought it would because it really did seem like one I'd enjoy.",

            "content": "I started watching \"Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai\" due to a recommendation, and thus expected something that would really catch my interest. However, five episodes in and I've realized that there's nothing particularly special about it at all.\r\nStory: 5\r\nIt's the same thing you've seen again and again. A budding romance between the two main characters. Now, obviously this isn't always a bad thing, but the problem is that there's nothing that stands out. They have this element of photography in the series, but it's not a photography anime so it's usually just a plot device.\r\nArt: 7\r\nEpisode 1 has some really pretty shots in it, butthat's the best it gets. The character designs are typical, but they are still well made and the backgrounds are good too.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nThis may be an unpopular opinion, but the sound isn't great at all. I feel like the op and ed are things I've already heard before. Same with the soundtracks. Nothing stands out to me, but nothing is necessarily terrible.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nI'll be honest, I would've given this category a lower score if not for Ijuuin. Just like the others, he fits into one of the generic tropes, but he is still hard to dislike. Despite being presented as the popular player type, that part of him actually takes a back seat to the fact that he is Tada's friend. On the other hand, I find Teresa to be completely unbearable. Although they continuously hint at her being a deeper character, we never actually experience it. Like most foreigner characters, she has learned Japanese almost perfectly, and yet her one defining factor is this undying love for Rainbow Shogun. In fact, this is all her character seems to revolve around, as she connects it to every single thing ever. Any sort of deeper understanding is completely overshadowed by this obsession, and she's supposed to be the main girl. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nI understand that this anime is supposed to give off a comfy feel to it, but I don't feel it at all. Every episode has something happen, only for it to not matter at all in any future episode. Every time I finish an episode, all I can think is, \"Well, that's done.\" The funniest part of the show is Ijuuin being scared of Alexandra, and even that only gets a slight chuckle out of me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nI know there will be people who enjoy this show, and that's fine. It should be given a chance. Everyone has their own preferences. However, if you do not enjoy the most generic of generic, this show probably isn't for you. That's your warning. Obviously as more comes out, my opinions may change, but I don't expect this show to get much better than it already is. This show fails to do anything to stand out from the rest, but it's not garbage.",

            "content": "I had numerous problems while watching Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinmai, particularly the plot and characters. The plot is extremely transparent from the get go when we learn that Teresa is a princess and this is an romance anime. There were many avenues to go about this with, most which would probably have a better plot, however, they decide to go with a school slice of life which ramps from 0 to 100 within the last few episodes. Which such obvious cues, it made it hard to find myself invested within the story. Pacing issues and an uninteresting plot aside, the characters were extremely one-dimensional.The biggest offense is Tada, who is extremely boring and doesn't really do much unless the story demands him to do anything. Honestly, his only quirk is that he is a nice dude and when we compare him to Charles, who is nice and charismatic as well, frustrated me to no end knowing what they conclusion would probably have been. The supporting characters are full of 'one-trick ponies' and repeat the same jokes from the start to the finish. \\n\\n\r\nTada-kun wa Koi ao Shinmai, starts off pretty strong, however, it loses all of its momentum and becomes a pretty boring anime. The lack of a standout characters and a poorly paced plot really hindered this from becoming good. The ending also left a bitter feeling, as it does not feel deserved or conclusive about anything. I recommend watching something else as I feel that there are plenty of anime that do the same job better. I may seem like a happy ending hater but, IDGAF. Have a nice day.",

            "content": "Tada-kun wa Koi wo Shinai... First of all, the name of the series has nothing to do with the anime. Because, not even he does fall in love, but it was never part of his character trope to not fall in love with anyone, he just had better things to think before falling for someone.\r\nWith the synopsis, I expected more to be honest, the plot have some holes, and it was too clich\u00e9. Since it was an original anime we could forgive it for a bit, all the simpleness of the story. The first few episodes started great! But each episode, things were getting worse...and worse... until the last episode, the was a complete mess. Not artistically actually, overall the anime had a pretty decent animation that kept it's quality over all 13 episodes, with some really beautiful shots sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nTo not be too critic, it did have some good points, the first 3/4 episodes were one,  a second was the animation that I already talked about, and the third were the sound, the ending was pretty generic, but it gets some points because it was a seiyuu that sang it. The opening was pretty satisfying too, I got myself singing it while listening. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were boring though, just like the pre-determined couples, only two of the four were quite interesting (and no, it wasn't the main characters one, they were the worst to be honest), they even teased one couple and they even didn't end up together! (I'm not going to say which though, that's for you to discover after you watched it) (But guess what? It was my favorite one...). Teresa had a predictable history, and Tada-kun a boring, overused one.\\n\\n\r\nFrom all the characters, the best one were Tada-kun's sister, Mitsuyoshi (that surprisingly had some depth in it, the character that everyone saw as the fool had one of the best developments), hell even the old man that owned the shop was more likable than the main characters!\\n\\n\r\nAfter all this criticism I still gave it a 7 for the enjoyment, I had quite the fun watching it, but still I was expecting much more from it. Overall I give it a 6, too much clich\u00e9 and overused tropes, but decent sound and animation, if you forget about Teresa and Tada-kun everything seems quite good actually! (Am I talking about SAO here? haha...) \\n\\n\r\nI recommend to watch it when you just want a cheesy, romance anime to pass your time, don't expect a masterpiece like Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun, or a good romance develpment like Sukitte Ii na Yo (though many disagree with me in this)",

            "content": "NON SPOILER REVIEW  \r\nI have just finished watching this anime, here is my review fresh off my mind.\r\nWHAT I LIKED\r\nThis was a simple 13 episode rom-com anime that was enjoyable to watch. The story was pretty generic, but at the end of the day, you are pretty satisfied with all that is said and done by the main and side character(s). This is an original anime meaning there is no adaptation to follow on. It may be a strength or weakness, but the watchers will have some peace of mind that whatever comes after the ending is up to the imaginations of the watcherswhether it is happy or sad. The art was fantastic and the animations had the quality of a top studio production. The drama shown in  the anime was good to keep me watching episode by episode and many people I feel could relate to the events pertaining to the main characters. One of the best things I like in this anime was the amount of symbolism you can find if you look between the lines and how it describes the development and regrets of our main characters.     \\n\\n\r\nWhat I disliked\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the story was very slow in the beginning few episodes. It feels like some of the episodes were \"fillers\" even though they were not. I would have liked to see more development between characters in these episodes, especially on the main romantic interests. The romance between these two main characters seems to have just popped out in 1 episode rather than accumulating over a long period of time. There were many times the cat would take place to break the ice (comedic relief) and I thought that there could be more romantic development in these places.  Due to this, at the end of the anime, I come out wondering if the romance was more like a high school \"spur of the moment\" kind of event rather than true love. There was also a lot of lost potential in this anime. As many reviewers said, it could have been much better and I agree. I wish they developed more on the photography aspect of the anime but I feel as if I was sold short as photography does have symbolism in the anime but wasn't the main part of the story.         \\n\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch a short anime that has a generic story line but is enjoyable to watch, I highly recommend it. Although this anime isn't something you'll have a thousand words about, this also isn't an anime you'll watch as say \"This was a waste of my time.\" I do believe that this anime do have its own merits and strengths and if you can look past all of its faults, you have an enjoyable rom-com story you'll surely laugh and be happy with.",

            "content": "\"Tada-Kun Never Falls In Love\" has no business being good. It borrows some of the oldest tropes in the book, its 'plot twists' can be seen a mile away, and calling much of anything about it original would lead me to think you REALLY don't watch much romance in any medium. And yet... you end up enjoying it. It can be strangely charming, perhaps simply because it has no pretensions of being anything other than what it is and plays it straight.\r\nShe's a bubbly, naive princess trying to get outside of her sheltered royal life, he's a jaded, more mature guy, they meet and boththeir lives change. Stop me if you've heard this one before. OK, you probably have- Tada-Kun has some striking resemblances to a famous old black-and-white American romantic film called 'Roman Holiday'. The OP even includes a brief clip of Tada and Teresa on a Vespa scooter that directly references the most iconic scene of the film. Maybe that's what let me let my guard down with this show, it quietly acknowledged what it was going for and didn't put on any airs. Now granted, if you don't accept this series for what it is you probably won't be following along for very long. There isn't much comedy that goes beyond getting a chuckle (except for a brilliant gag involving a Golgo 13 reference of all things), and towards the end it can be plenty melodramatic.\\n\\n\r\nNow while animation is fairly standard, the aesthetic is quite nice. It has a vaguely pastel look that can be quite soothing and the character designs, while they follow well-worn archetypes are nice enough. Sound is a flat 5 here, I don't remember any of it for good or bad. The characters are also nothing you haven't seen before. For example, Tada's two best friends are the comic relief guy and the girl-crazed horndog senpai, two archetypes who are practically obligated to appear in every anime love story until Japan sinks back into the Pacific Ocean. Also, Hinako must be ordering her eye glass from the same place Superman gets his...\\n\\n\r\nI don't know how they did it, but 'Tada-Kun' on paper did everything wrong... but still came out alright.",

Firstly, it's full of romance, and anime cliches which do not automatically disqualify it from getting a good score from me especially if you have a creative way of using those clique's, or have an enjoyable cast to offset that. \r\nTada does have a fairly strong cast I enjoyed, but there a couple ofweak members who are kind of important...........

It's not that they are entirely bad per se, but throughout the show, I never felt they had any chemistry, which is vital for a show that has its main focus as romance. \\n\\n\r\nAlso to resolve the central romance at the end of the show they kind of shelf any conclusion for any of the other potential couples in the series which ticked me off particularly with Pin and Hana's relationship, because I wanted some resolution there.\\n\\n\r\nSome Points I will give to this show's favor the art is way above industry standard and instead of doing the fiance is a total prick he is actually a really cool guy.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: So after last season and simmering on my thoughts of the show after a while I have to downgrade the show a point as I feel it no longer deserves that high a rating.",

            "content": "IMO, if this anime was released like a few years back, I think it'll get a score of 8.\r\nThis anime reminds me slightly of Tsuki ga Kirei. Probably due to its story progression a bit similar to each other. \r\nStory:\r\nI've seen this kind of plot being abused mostly by harem animes. I don't remember watching an anime which actually takes this kind of plot up to the next level until I found this. (i forgot but whatever)\r\nIn this anime, its plot was modified to be logical as possible for most scenes. Any yee-yee-ass anime will make the MC or any character do something cool orWTF and you wouldn't do the same shit in real life don't you? As if you're that lucky. LOL.\\n\\n\r\nThe story progression is smooth, every episode end left me wanting to know more. You'll see mostly generic stuff/scenes/incident thorughout the storyline which basically you'd already seen in most rom-com anime. I know its overused, but at least this anime is able to present it better than I expected.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nMC reminds of Gekkan Shoujo's MC.\\n\r\nTeresa reminds me of Kato from Saekano.\\n\\n\r\nBut nonetheless, no complain about art or animations. They look refined yet simple. I'm not saying similar looking characters are bad, its just that it 'look' similar. That's all. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI think the OP could be more better with this type of anime. Don't know about the lyrics though, but overall, I'd say OK. \\n\\n\r\nNo complain about SFX, I think it did a great job on hooking myself to the character's real time emotion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is a peaceful anime. I didn't find any villain or 'bad' guy in this one lol. Even if there is one, he's very understandable. If it were the animes I watched previously, expect some useless fights or wars. \\n\\n\r\nAs usual, most noticeable character development was the MC and Teresa. Others might have though but not that deep and they only showed some history flashbacks and so on. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe way this anime presents the character's story lives actually had me going. There are times you'll feel happy or sad together with the characters itself. Love it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI'll try my best to say as accurately as I can on what would you get in this anime.\\n\\n\r\n- Expect some clich\u00e9 stuffs BUT, with a good presentation\\n\r\n- The characters are so gentle which I think this anime is good if you're looking for relaxing anime with no misunderstandings or fights. (even if there is, its not that big anyways lol)\\n\r\n- Story progression is slightly similar to Tsuki ga Kirei.\\n\r\n- Ending? It doesn't make you cry. That's all I can say. Go watch & judge for youselves\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "While a 7 out of 10 is nothing to scoff at, part of me is genuinely disappointed I couldn\u2019t give this an 8. It\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve seen an entirely original romance anime. No manga or light novel to work off of or use as a template. However, Tada Never Falls in Love (or just Tadakoi) in no way feels original. I\u2019ve seen plenty of romance anime and it honestly just felt like I\u2019ve seen most of the romantic development before. Even worse, the central romance of the anime didn\u2019t really get any focus until Episodes 6 and 8-13. Episodes 1-5 and 7 weremostly dedicated to either casual Slice of Life antics (Which isn\u2019t bad by all means) or romantic sub-plots that don\u2019t go anywhere. I truly feel like Tadakoi should\u2019ve been 24 episodes long. It felt like it wanted to accomplish too much within the 13 episodes it had to work with. While the romance was fairly cliche and the slice of life segments weren\u2019t anything special, Tadakoi is still a good anime. It uses all the good cliches at the very least, so there\u2019s nothing aggravating about the anime for the most part. The characters were simply good. Nothing great or memorable, but solid nonetheless. Tada was quiet and rather stoic for a main character but still a very chill guy, Teresa was a lovable love interest, Ijuuin was voiced by Mamoru Miyano so he half stole the show, half got a bit too much at times (Like most of Miyano\u2019s roles to be honest.) The rest of the cast weren\u2019t anything worth mentioning as they didn\u2019t really add much. There was a decent romantic subplot between Pin-senpai and Hinako (Friends of Tada and company in the Photography Club) but the anime essentially ran out of time for them. That entire subplot was forgotten by the anime in favor of the two main characters after Episode 8. As your standard slice of life school anime, the first 5-6 episodes are good. However, knowing full well that it\u2019s a romance anime, it started to get a bit old. I wanted to see the development of the main romance, but it got pushed farther and farther back right until the very end. Speaking of, I won\u2019t completely spoil the ending, but god damn it, I\u2019m disappointed with it. It had everything perfectly set up for an unique ending, but settled for being generic at the LITERAL last minute. For me, it managed to raise more questions than answers. While the animation was gorgeous at times and accompanied by a very good soundtrack, Tadakoi is ultimately generic story wise. It\u2019s a romance anime you\u2019ve probably seen countless times before, but it\u2019s fairly difficult to hate. Not a whole lot to love, but far from being average.",

Seriously, stop me if you've ever heard this one (Spoilers):\r\n- Boy meets girl\r\n- Girl is incredibly good looking\r\n- She is also the new exchange student in boys class\r\n- She also now lives next to boy for her stay in Japan\r\nPredictable. Utterly, utterly predictable. \r\nHOWEVER, this is, in fact, not a bad anime. It's above average actually. \r\nI really like the shows simplistic, yet not ugly drawing style and sometimes you can see small details of backstory scattered here and there. For example, pay closeattention to the young couple of episode one, since this is not the last appearance they make in the anime. Or the mean looking dude who resembles the main character in a show an awful lot. \\n\\n\r\nThe endingsong is nice, and soothing the kind that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside, while the opening gives off happy, feel good vibes. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not annoying and are all fun to watch. I feel like one might could've expanded on their storys or their afterstorys a bit, but ey, it's 13 episodes, what are you gonna do? \\n\\n\r\nWhile it's true that this show brings almost nothing new to the table, I can recommend it to anyone looking for a short and sweet romancestory that one can breeze through in a couple of hours. \\n\\n",

The element of Ijuin being a \"comedy relief\" doesn'tmake it better, because it take away any sense of seriousness that drama could have had. \\n\r\nAll in all, I feel like they had interesting characters but made nothing out of it.\\n\r\nThe animation is poor and the music is forgettable.\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a romantic anime, I would not recommend this one.",

The conversation between Alec and Ijuin is hilarious. It also has one perverted character which is always nice for that adult factor. The art is well done and voice cast is superb too.
