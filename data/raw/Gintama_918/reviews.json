            "content": "Over the years there have been a multitude of comedy shows that have graced our TV screens, from the surreal stylings of Monty Python and sarcastic wit of Blackadder, to the sci-fi tomfoolery of Red Dwarf and the strange antics of The Fast Show. There are numerous notable series that have taken their rightful places in our DVD collections, and in an age where comedians are treated like rock stars, maybe it's fate that comedy anime would also come of age.\r\nIt's strange to say this, but humour has never been a strong department for the medium, partly because of the cultural differences between East andWest, but mainly because the majority of anime comedies rely more on parody than anything else. The problem with this is that quite often the viewer is left without a frame of reference, so the humour simply goes over their heads. Some shows manage to get away with it purely by throwing out an almost constant stream of gags in the hope that people will understand enough of them to be entertained, while others like Seto no Hanayome and Jungle wa Itsumo Hale Nochi Guu have a slightly more careful approach.\\n\\n\r\nThe area where anime is weakest is where situational comedy is concerned. There are plenty of shows around that could invariably class themselves as sit-coms, but the penchant for studios to base their stories in some sort of school setting severely limits the quality of the humour. In essence, the industry's blind adherence to what they think is a winning formula has resulted in the dilution of just about every single joke that could be told in a school setting, so much so in fact that these days studios have fallen to relying on fanservice based comedies in order to make ends meet (pardon the pun).\\n\\n\r\nComedy anime isn't dead though, as there are some rays of light shining down on the wreckage of red noses, bladders on sticks and giant shoes. Nodame Cantabile insane otaku heroine and her long suffering boyfriend introduced many people to the world of classical music and the usage of otaku power when learning French. Genshiken took a slightly rose tinted look at the multi-layered world of the Japanese otaku, while Moyashimon payed homage to the classic American frat comedy National Lampoon's Animal House.\\n\\n\r\nOne series has, however, defied all the conventions, and has become one of the greatest comedy anime of all time. Incorporating elements from some of the best comedy of both East and West, the series has an anarchic streak that, at times, is more reminiscent of Monty Python, The Simpsons and Family Guy.\\n\\n\r\nI am, of course, talking about Gintama.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of a samurai sit-com isn't new to anime and manga, however it wasn't until the serialisation of Sorachi Hideaki's manga in 2003 that anyone actually realised the potential in this type of story. Set in a quasi-historical Edo, Japan (and possibly the rest of the world), has been conquered by an alien race known as the Amanto. The nation's strongest warriors were no match for the alien technology, and in an effort to prevent another samurai uprising, the powers that be have banned humans from carrying swords in public.\\n\\n\r\nIn this world there lives a former samurai with silver hair who runs the firm known as Yorozuya from his rented second floor apartment. From time to time he takes on odd jobs (yorozuya), for people in order to pay his rent and buy milkshakes and his beloved Weekly Shounen Jump.\\n\\n\r\nHe is Sakata Gintoki, and his destiny is to make you cry with laughter.\\n\\n\r\nTo say that the story is a bit on the haphazard side is probably a gross understatement, however Gintama is nothing if not consistent in its approach. The underlying story is of Gintoki and his \"friends\", Shimura Shinpachi (an average human teenager with no real special qualities), and Kagura (an alien who looks human and possesses monstrous strength), as they go through their days doing odd jobs for people, getting into arguments/figths with the Shinsengumi (police, kind of), drinking strawberry milkshakes (or some other flavour depending on Gintoki's mood), and trying in some small way to make the world a better place.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's really about as serious as many of the episodes get. The haphazard approach to the story is a purposeful measure that, strangely enough, works very well, mainly because Gintama is a comedy series. There are story arcs that occur over the course of the show, and even though they may include some serious or dramatic content, Gintama never once loses its sense of fun. Indeed, the comedy is the true strength of this series, not simply in its style and delivery, but also in its content. Many of the visual gags have to be seen to be believed (seriously, how the hell did they get away with the Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon), and whilst the series is top-filled with parodies, the humour is always involving so the viewer rarely feels like a joke has gone over their head.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, Ginatama has one aspect that is greater than all others in terms of its plot and comedy content, and that is its ability to turn the seemingly ordinary into something completely different. This is the main reason why Gintama can be considered a sit-com rather than a parody, as this aspect has more in common with shows like Blackadder and Monty Python than anything else. There are numerous occasions where the series will catch the viewer off guard with its sly, anarchic take on seemingly normal events (like being in a public toilet and running out of paper).\\n\\n\r\nOf course, there are downsides too. Although the series is extremely strong in terms of comedy, it sometimes lacks when events take a serious turn. This may be due to the audience's reactions, as viewers may automatically think that something funny is going to happen next, however a part of it also stems from the fact that the comedy is sometimes too \"strong\". It's ironic to say this, but Gintama's greatest strength may also be its biggest weakness.\\n\\n\r\nAs with any long running shounen series animation and design are pretty good on the whole. The characters convey a sense of visual individuality that at times goes beyond that of other shounen anime, although this is tempered with a small degree of genericism that allows the humour to flourish  . The colours are extremely bold and solid, while the backgrounds and set designs highlight the synergy between alien technology and Edo. The animation itself is of an extremely high standard, so much so in fact that some of the visual gags only really work because of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe high points of the visuals are the show's numerous and well crafted parodies. There are many occasions where the style, animation, end even the character design, changes to make the humour more immediate, sometimes occuring in the blink of an eye, and sometimes lasting for a good portion of a given episode. The series also plays around with a variety of concepts that most people only really read about, one example being an occasion where Gintoki and the gang are rendered invisible because the episode is incomplete. It's nigh on impossible to find another anime that not only mentions something like this, but also shows the viewer what it would look like.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the humour comes from the characters themselves, but no matter how good the scripting is, delivery is everything when it comes to comedy, and in this respect Gintama is extremely well served by its seiyuu. The cast are able to perform with a panache that is sometimes astonishing, and their portrayals of their respective characters are so good that one would be forgiven for believing they were full time comedians. Possibly the best example of this is Kugimiya Rie (Kagura), who for many years has been typecast into various tsundere roles. Her portrayal of Kagura is truly excellent, especially in terms of comedy, and much like the rest of the cast she manages to not only maintain a consistent character for a an extended period of time, but has actually become more adept with her timing and delivery.\\n\\n\r\nGintama is generally consistent with its choice of music, and certain tracks are repeated throughout the series usually to add to the comic atmosphere of a given scene. That said, some of the more serious moments can feel a little off-kilter as the score changes can sometimes be a little sudden. As with any long running series the OP and ED have changed since the show began airing in 2006. These tracks are usually pretty good at capturing the essence of  Gintama (which just sounds wrong), as a whole, and the opening sequences are designed and choregraphed to highlight the important aspects of the anime - humour, fun, some seriousness, and a large slice of anarchy.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty, there is no real reason to find the characters outstanding, and the fact that they are iconic, original and memorable is possibly Gintama's greatest triumph. Gintoki, Shinpachi, Kagura, the members of the Shinsengumi, and all the sundry characters, alien and otherwise, who appear in the show will find some funny bone to tickle. When taken as individuals each is a flawed creation that really wouldn't work were this any other anime, but the plot and scripting for the series, together with the talent of the seiyuu and the design of each character, turns this idea completely on its head. Much of the comedy is dependent on the characters, and it's because the series is so good at entertaining the audience that any noticeable flaws are generally forgiven or ignored.\\n\\n\r\nGintama is not simply a funny anime though. Over the seasons the show has gradually become a phenomenon in the medium, mainly because of its ability to maintain consistent humour for over most of its 201 episodes. The irreverent and oh-so anarchic humour can, at times, come off as weird, but this has only served to endear the series to more viewers.\\n\\n\r\nNumerous fans refer to Gintama as their \"anime crack\", a sentiment which is understandable in a sense as it has the ability to lift one's mood in a way that few other anime can manage. That doesn't mean that everyone will be entertained though, but if the viewer approaches the show with the right sort of mindset (e.g. open), then the series has a lot to offer.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, shounen fans will definitely find Gintama appealing, not simply because it bears all the stereotypical hallmarks of that genre of anime, but also for its ability to creatively parody other shounen tales (like Bleach, Naruto, One Piece, etc - who can forget the infamous DragonBleaPiece movie trailer). Fans of comedy anime like Seto no Hanayome, Jungle wa Itsumo Hale Nochi Guu and others of that ilk, will also find Gintama's ability to mess with everyday concepts worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of aspects to the series that possess a broad appeal in terms of humour, and it's to the credit of everyone involved with the production (from mangaka Sorachi Hideaki on down to the guy/girl who makes the tea), that the show never gets old, stale, or too bogged down in how good it actually is.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a new king of comedy in town. Make way for Gintama.",

            "content": "Gintama? Gintama. Hmmm, Gintama... Gintama or not Gintama, that is the question.\r\nNow this is a show I've wrestled with for a long time. Many of my friends pledged almost fanatically this is the best anime in existence. I watched the first episode. So this is it? I was not impressed. As a person who found pleasure in the darkest and most gloomy kinds of settings, I would almost immediately say that this was not for me. Everything was just so weird and appeared to be arbitrarily glued together.\r\nI was so na\u00efve.\r\nAt some point I picked Gintama up again, I\u2019m one of the people who arenot easily moved to laughter but still, there had to be something to this\u2026 Let me tell you this, Gintama is a journey, a pilgrimage. You will not appreciate it after two or three episodes, even twenty may not be enough. It took me sixty whole episodes when I was finally thoroughly entertained but it was then that I realized: Gintama is like a snowball rolling down a mountain. It\u2019s barely recognizable at first but the next time you turn your gaze in its direction, it will have turned into an avalanche. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nSooo\u2026 yeah, this is actually hard. Gintama is composed of a series of mini arcs that have no real connection to each other. You can\u2019t call it a consistent storyline but it\u2019s also not really episodic, there are also fillers organically weaved into the style and pace of the anime. A strange kind of hybrid, that still works somehow. We have different little events like the Benizakura, Yoshiwara or Popularity Poll arc, which all are amazingly done. Action, drama and most of all comedy, Gintama\u2019s got them all and none of them are bad. Also, because I can\u2019t find a better place to do this, let may tell you a few things about the often overlooked setting. The pseudo-medieval, post war Japanese capital Edo with modern technology, invaded by a multitude of alien races called Amanto. Sounds utterly random right? Wrong. It is my firm believe that this setting is actually the backbone of Gintama. Why you ask? Because it allows for the greatest number of possible scenarios, different people and places. You can have a samurai, a rebel leader, an alien and a penguin costume guy added to the cast and nobody bats an eye, because it still feels natural. Never forget the setting, it makes this anime what it is.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nIt\u2019s strange, when I started watching I thought to myself \u2018This looks somehow generic\u2019 but at the same time \u2018This looks somehow unique\u2019. It\u2019s hard to explain but that\u2019s the feeling I get from Gintama. Visual quality may not be top notch here but it gets progressively better, a fact that is especially apparent in latter battle sequences. I would leave it at nine points but there\u2019s another thing\u2026 facial expressions. They are beyond hilarious, I won\u2019t say too much about it but you will understand once you have seen a few exemplary episodes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThere are a few very iconic and memorable tracks on the Gintama OST, that\u2019s probably due to the fact that they are used so frequently but that doesn\u2019t mean that I ever got sick of them. Audio is mostly bright and uplifting, fitting to the animes focus on comedy. Opening and ending themes are also pleasing, notably Donten and Stairway Generation. This would also be a eight or nine if it wasn\u2019t for the seiyuus. These guys are BRILLIANT! Every voice fits its character and Sugita Tomokazu is probably the most unique voice I have ever heard in anime. He\u2019s now the voice of Gintoki for me, forever. Kugumiya Rie is a rather well-known name, revered for her roles as your run of the mill tsundere girls. Kagura was a kind of character that was probably new to her but she still did an excellent job. There are a dozen other examples but I\u2019m not going into debt on all of them, only thing you have to know is that the voiceover job is amazing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nAlright, so this is the deciding factor that makes this anime awesome. Here we have some amazingly thought out characters and not just for comedy purposes, most of them have a backstory, even the vilest of antagonists are not just pure embodied malice. This is also what causes the anime to take time to get going, you have to get to know the characters. A naked random guy is very much different to a naked Isao Kondo. Almost all of them are likeable, memorable and most of all funny. We have no focus on development here but such progression would do more harm than anything else. It takes time to get to know them and that process is very important, changing a well-established character after that process is complete doesn\u2019t strike me as a good idea.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nIt takes time, 60 episodes to get it rolling, 140 episodes to have me almost dying of laughter but it was well worth it. Gintama maintains a consistent, no, increasing level of entertainment over the course of its 201 episodes. It\u2019s already hilarious and would have been even better if I was capable of understanding the Japanese language without subtitles or if I\u2019d seen more anime to understand all the parodies going on. Knowledge of basic Shounen Jump, Ghibli Movies, NGE, Doraemon or Gundam widely enhances the spectrum of jokes you can laugh about. Even without that and as part of a western audience, I found myself crying out in laughter over a majority of the jokes, there are just so many of them, no way you can miss everything.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nResult: 10/10\\n\r\nSo are all these people right, is Gintama the best anime of all time? I dare not to pass judgment unto that, simply because Gintama is so unique and unconventional that I feel it falls into a category of its own. There is no competition for this anime in its specific category because it\u2019s the only one that ever made it there. This is not the best of all anime, this is just Gintama, don\u2019t lump it together with all the others! Even if they\u2019re brilliant, if they\u2019re entrancing, if they\u2019re masterpieces, don\u2019t make that mistake. I myself who is speaking so highly of this anime have other favorites; this is simply Gintama, no need for comparison.\\n\\n\r\nIf you plan on taking a shot at Gintama and you\u2019re not completely hooked after the first few episodes, bring a lot of patience, it will pay off.\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review here, so please let me know what you guys think!\r\nGintama is about Sakata Gintoki, who is a samurai in an age where samurai\\'s have been deemed unnecessary by the aliens who have taken over. As far as I can tell, that\\'s about as deep of a story this anime has. But you probably won\\'t care, because this anime is downright hilarious. The characters are funny, the situations they get in are completely ridiculous, and all the references to other anime/manga they have make it all the more enjoyable.\r\n--Story--\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, there really isn\\'t too much of a story line.Most of the story arcs last about 1-2 episodes, and some are pretty strange. But all the random references and pure comedy make up for any shortcoming in the story.\\n\\n\r\n--Art--\\n\r\nThe animation is just what you\\'d expect from a good comedy anime. The characters have their distinctive features, the backgrounds are pretty detailed, and you get all the classic elements that you\\'d expect from a comedy anime (depression lines, expanding heads, etc.).\\n\\n\r\n--Sound--\\n\r\nThe openings and closings are really good. They\\'re all catchy and make you actually want to listen to them. The voice acting is well done and really gives life to the characters.\\n\\n\r\n--Character--\\n\r\nThe characters really make this anime awesome. From the Jump reading samurai Gintoki to the machine-gun-umbrella toting Kagura to the oversized skull-biting dog Sadaharu, everyone is unique and hilarious in their own way. There are a lot of recurring characters, and each has his or her own traits that set them apart from the rest. Also, a lot of the characters resemble characters from other anime, but with a twist. For example, the main character Sakata Gintoki is very similar to Himura Kenshin from Rurouni Kenshin, as both are very accomplished samurai; but while Kenshin is for the most part kind and quiet, Gintoki is very eccentric, somewhat rude at times, and seems to be overall very apathetic about everything. Things like this really make the characters familiar, yet unique, and overall very likeable.\\n\\n\r\n--Enjoyment--\\n\r\nThis anime makes me laugh out loud. Literally. There have been occasions where I nealy fell out of my chair of laughter. I\\'m always a little sad when an episode ends, because I laughed so much during the episode.\\n\\n\r\n--Overall--\\n\r\nIf you like comedy and have watched your share of anime, then I highly recommend Gintama. If you aren\\'t well versed in anime, you may miss a bunch of references, but that shouldn\\'t really affect your enjoyment of this anime. Overall, this anime is one of my favorite.",

            "content": "Gintama is an ongoing manga by Sorachi Hideaki. From 2006 to 2010, Sunrise, the same studio behind the Gundam franchise, did an anime adaptation which lasted for just over 200 episodes. So, does the anime manage to stay entertaining for that long, or even be entertaining at all? Let\u2019s take a peek and find out.\r\nStory:\r\nThere isn\u2019t a single cohesive narrative to Gintama. There are some loosely connected arcs, and a whole lot of episodes that have nothing to do with those arcs, but there is no single narrative. The basic setup is that the world has been conquered by aliens, referred to in Gintama as\u201cAmanto\u201d and the government is still subservient to them. Samurai are no longer allowed to carry swords except for a few who work for the government or who have wealth and connections. In this world a samurai named Gintoki works by, in theory, doing odd jobs. Although that largely consists of him doing nothing. His crew consists of a youngster named Shinpachi, an Amanto girl named Kagura who possesses super strength and is highly vulnerable to sunlight, and a giant dog named Sadaharu, our cute character who requires ear scritches and belly rubs. Hijinks ensue as this group and the people around them get into shenanigans.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s begin by looking at the problems with the series, shall we? By far the biggest issue is that the writing aesthetic is horribly inconsistent. Most of the episodes are highly random and intended for humour but when they get to the more story heavy arcs things take a huge shift into serious territory, sometimes including really heavy topics like sex trafficking, and it creates a huge tonal clash between episodes. You can\u2019t segue from jokes about testicles and bloody rectums into a story about an underground city where children are sold to be raised as sex slaves. There is quite literally no way to make that transition so that it isn\u2019t painfully awkward and completely disrespectful to the serious issue. It\u2019s worse than that Captain Planet episode that dealt with AIDS. Sure, that was way over the series\u2019 head too, but there wasn\u2019t such a radical tonal problem. The tone isn\u2019t the only thing that has problems with consistency, there\u2019s also the continuity. There are three basic ways to do continuity. The first is having a strict, coherent continuity where everything matters. The second is to have a basic progression from one episode to the next but the details aren\u2019t that important. The third is to toss continuity out the window completely, like Galaxy Angel. The problem with Gintama is that it does all three. Some episodes deal very much with continuity as being super important, others follow the more fast and loose route where there\u2019s a progression but the details aren\u2019t important and there are other episodes that don\u2019t fit into any kind of continuity and will never be mentioned again after they\u2019re over.\\n\\n\r\nNow that we\u2019ve been over that, let\u2019s talk a bit about the comedy in this series that is, mostly, comedic. A lot of it is pretty puerile humour where someone defecates in their pants, or someone\u2019s anus bleeds or where the punchline is something involving testicles. There are also a lot of bits where the characters will make loud references to some other piece of media and there are some other random bits of humour. The trouble is, a lot of it really isn\u2019t funny. For example, there\u2019s a running gag about one of the characters eating too much mayonnaise which is funny because\u2026 if he ate that much mayo in reality he\u2019d weigh two hundred kilos and have to get around with a motorised scooter? There are two characters who pretty much exist for stalker jokes and there\u2019s another running joke about Katsura getting annoyed by people calling him the wrong thing. There are times when the randomness can work and there are some points where they parody something competently instead of just making reference to it but they\u2019re few and far between. I will give the series full credit for having some surprisingly clever deconstructions here and there, particularly when it comes to its treatment of trans-gendered characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nGintama has a large cast of reoccurring characters, but very little in terms of complex ones. Most of them are used for one or two jokes and that\u2019s pretty much it. I will say that there\u2019s nothing wrong with that for a comedic work. You can have a bunch of fairly one-note characters as long as they have dynamics that provide good comedic possibilities and you can take advantage of that. The problem is the more serious episodes. This cast would be perfectly passable if the series didn\u2019t have those largely serious story arcs but when you take a bunch of relatively shallow comedic characters and try to do something fairly serious with them it just quickly loses any sense of tension and the characters come across as heavily under-developed, if not as completely out of place.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and animation are pretty decent. There are some cases where they recycle footage or show a background with nothing happening, which they will almost always lampshade, but it\u2019s competently done. The action sequences can be pretty strong, both when they\u2019re doing something largely serious and when they\u2019re doing a jokey action scene.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe actors are pretty capable and no one does badly. However, the level of over-exaggeration in the series is really high and you might very well find yourself growing weary of listening to people shouting. The music varies. Sometimes it\u2019s pretty good, sometimes it\u2019s kind of annoying. Mostly, it\u2019s just kind of bland.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s some in the series. There\u2019s an openly lesbian character who shows up on a semi-regular basis and there\u2019s a guy who is heavily implied to have romantic feelings for Sougo who shows up for a couple of episodes late in the series. There\u2019s no reciprocation for their feelings, but they also aren\u2019t used for jokes based on their sexuality. Some of the other characters act like asses about it at points, but the series itself doesn\u2019t treat it as an issue. So, I\u2019ll give Gintama some credit for treating its gay characters no differently than it does its straight characters. It is pretty refreshing, especially when you have \u201ccomedies\u201d like Baka to Test that have to be as mean-spirited as possible about things like that.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nGintama has a real problem with consistency. Its tone is wildly inconsistent which can lead to some really awkward and stilted moments. It\u2019s inconsistent with what it wants to do with its continuity. If you like humour that\u2019s more than a little puerile and pretty random then you might still enjoy the series in spite of that and there are some things it does pretty decently but it\u2019s honestly not my cup of tea in that regard. I just don\u2019t find ninety percent of the attempts at humour to be amusing. As such, I have to give the series a 4/10. Next week we\u2019ll have this year\u2019s film festival. Starting with Kara no Kyoukai 6 on Sunday. Because I\u2019ve looked at that franchise first during the last two years and I might as well do it this time as well.",

            "content": "Gintama is a masterclass in comedy writing and variety; a series that grows in originality with each passing episode, so inventive and fresh, dynamic and interesting, it's no wonder it has become one of Sunrises' flagship series, not to mention a mainstay of Shounen Jump.\r\nThe plot - from the get-go - perfectly encapsulates what Gintama is about: it's absurd. The Gintama universe is limitless; anything can and will happen. This insane nature is perfectly explored through the episode structure. Chiefly, it's an episodic series, with multiple story arcs woven in-between. Each episode will see a new plot, exploring one (or multiple) aspects of this wideand wacky universe, along with the colorful and unpredictable cast. The stories range in genre, from thriller to flat-out comedy, but most have a humorous tone. Each episode is uniquely different from the next; they're brilliantly written, flawlessly executed narratives that fail to tire. The series displays a wonderful range of comedy, from parody to episode-long, painstakingly constructed, carefully executed gags; it's an ever-fresh and vigorous aspect and one of the series' many stand-out elements. The story arcs further explore the world and the characters of Gintama, some in humorous ways, but most in a more dramatic fashion, which adds further variety and heightened drama to the series. The diversity and imagination on display is hugely admirable, especially given the series' length. Gintama doesn't know fatigue; it stays at a consistent, extremely high quality throughout, with fresh new plot devices, scenarios and twists being continually introduced even years after its first broadcast - the writing is incredibly commendable.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art style is ever-impressive; the anime staff seamlessly bring to life such a crazed, hectic and involved world from the pages of Sorachi's manga. The anime has a colorful, visually pleasing style, with flawlessly animated explosive action set pieces, heart-wrenching dramatic beats and eye-watering comedic reveals. The character designs are incredibly diverse and evoke well Sorachi's artwork, with Gintoki becoming an instantly recognisable anime icon.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and music is particularly well produced, with a huge amount of vocal talent on display. The score is incredibly elaborate and comprised of a vast variety of tracks, befitting of a series of this length. The backing tracks evoke well a number of different emotions, tones and moods, and blend seamlessly with the visuals, further bringing to life the world of Gintama. There are multiple stand-out compositions which are - above all else - memorable.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most appealing aspects of the series is without a doubt the characters. They're imaginative, memorable and varied creations, each unique and appealing in their own different way. The main characters present incredible amounts of enthusiasm and are the real driving force behind Gintama, but certain members of the unbelievably vast supporting cast are almost as integral in their own right. Sorachi's marvellous creativity shines through in the characters, just as it does the story, and it becomes obvious the anime staff have a complete understanding of the source material and an unwavering dedication to bring it to life. Given the gag-based nature of the series, the characters start off rather one dimensional, with little room to explore their background or the depths of their psyche in the episodic ventures, but the story arcs greatly expand on both the main characters and the prime supporting cast, developing their hearts and souls to a substantial, admirable degree.\\n\\n\r\nGintama is a marvel, chock-full with everlasting potential. It's a series as side-splittingly funny as it is deeply heartbreaking. It presents a miscellany of different genres, tones, characters, scenarios, music, emotions and comedy, all blended into one exquisitely written, flawlessly executed, brilliantly produced, intelligent stunner of a series. It's among the utmost best anime has to offer.",

            "content": "Gintama takes place in Edo(a.k.a Tokyo nowadays). Aliens who call themselves, the Amanto, have invaded Japan. In order to prevent another resistance of samurai's, they prohibited the use of swords. Only a handful of samurai's are remaining, Sakata Gintoki, a laid-back samurai who carries a wooden sword, is among these few. Together with Kagura, an extra-terrestrial girl with a monstrous strength, and Shinpachi, your average troubled adolescent, they'll take any kind of job as long as it fills their stomach and keeps them from getting kick out by the landlord.\r\nGintama is an action, comedy samurai anime with a sci-fi twist. You dont get to seethis kind of anime's anymore, heck youve never seen an anime like this before. I mean seriously, where can you find a samurai whose role model is Bleach's Ichigo Kurosaki? Or an intense ordeal involving four adults who all recently took a dump in a comfort room that has run out of toilet paper and now they must decide on who among them has to run outside butt naked, to relieve them from their predicament?\\n\\n\r\nUnlike most samurai's anime's, this anime is really all about the comedy.Dont misunderstand, their are several decent actions here and some of em are even pretty damn good but most of them are use for opportunity to present something extremely hilarious . Dont expect any amazing coup de grace here as Gintama doesnt want to be striking, it wants to be funny. But hey, it pays off. In an odd way, Gintama can be very unpredictable because of this. Its like watching the antics of Harry Houdini, you never know whats going to happen next. \\n\\n\r\nTo exaggerate something so insignificant is one of Gintama' primary nature. Now I would like to point out that Im not fond of slice of life anime's, because well lets face it, real life aint worth watching one cent especially when they all they do is talk about is the different ways to cut cheese. But Gintama is capable of making mundane circumstances into something incredibly ludicrous, that you have to be dead inside not to burst out and laugh your ass off.\\n\\n\r\nA good example would be when the gang were all dead hungry but there's only one remaining food left? Who gets to eat the last food? The epic psychological warfare begins. If you havent noticed, every second of that is insanely diverting. And yes, that episode is the best Death Note parody I have ever come across. Its doesnt stop there. Gintama has all kinds of parody, whethers its Star Wars, Resident Evil, or some famous horror flick, there's nothing that can escape the derision of Gintama. It is so amazing how they were able to successfully mix samurai and modern pop culture into one show.\\n\\n\r\nGintama is promising from the start. It boasts distinguished characters that make up a unique combination that opens up future comic possibilities.\\n\\n\r\nGintama is episodic, meaning dont expect any heavy character development, although there are some minor alterations as the series progresses but it doesnt make enough difference to be considered. Who needs development anyway? As long as its funny, thats good enough for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED in Gintama are pretty upbeat and catchy. Sometimes it can even make you laugh. As for the animation, it is fairly average. I have nothing against it because it fits right in the atmosphere of something utterly humorous.\\n\\n\r\nSome people consider Gintama as the only thing decent anime that Shounen Jump serialized. Others think of it as the next best thing since sliced bread. I am neither of this. The way I see it, Gintama can only warrant two things for a person. Either they become fans of Gintama or become dumb with astonishment that they resort to watching paint dry.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing you need to know about Gintama, it is blatantly comical. \\n\r\nAnd if thats what you have been looking for, then look no further. If not, look elsewhere.",

            "content": "Japan, a nation which was once known as \"samurai country\", has been invaded by aliens called the Amanto who now pull the strings of the government.  The samurai have been forced to become ordinary citizens and sheath their swords forever.  Gintoki Sakata, a former samurai who follows his own code of \"bushido\", was once a fierce warrior who can now barely scrape together the change to purchase this week's Shonen Jump.  What's a samurai to do?\r\nStory\r\nGintama is not an anime that one should approach expecting a plot.  It's an episodic action and adventure comedy that details the hilarious and ridiculous dailyescapades of Gintoki and the other boarders that are a part of his freelancing business.  The only thing that Gintoki, Kagura, and Shinpachi want is to be able to pay the month's rent but instead wind up attracting trouble like a magnet.  The jokes can be downright hilarious and the characters will literally go out of their way to say something funny at the wrong time.  It's not a series that I would recommend to new anime fans because a lot (but certainly not all) of the jokes poke fun at the anime subculture and even the more seasoned fans might have trouble understanding some of the Japanese cultural jokes to a point where it's like a Japanese Family Guy.  The fansubs do, however, take the time to explain a lot of the references.  It's also great to approach this series with at least some knowledge of Japanese history, particularly the Bakumatsu and Meiji Periods, due to the fact that a majority of the characters are based on historical figures. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe characters watch television dramas and read Weekly Shonen Jump but the scenery and the clothes do a good job of reminding us that this series is supposed to be based on the Meiji Period.  The backgrounds are detailed and the animation is generally smooth.  Facial expressions, as with any comedy anime, are important and the character designs suit the characters.  The overall semi-realistic art style helps the characters seem more realistic as well, though, it's not something I personally found to be especially unique.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe themes are fun, catchy, and upbeat.  I found that one of the most memorable things about Gintama's music was the fact that one of the ending songs, Mr. Raindrop, is entirely in (good) English!  The background music does not particularly stand out but its &quot;wild&quot; style suits the anime.  The voices fit the characters well and the acting is excellent.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd did I say that the most memorable thing about the sound of this anime was Mr. Raindrop?  I meant to say that the most memorable thing about this anime was the popular idol singer, Otsuu, who writes these catchy songs with crazy lyrics, like, &quot;Your brother is a hikikomori!&quot;\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nCharacters are the single most important feature in an episodic series such as Gintama and this is one area where this anime does not disappoint.  Every character has unique quirks that makes them interesting and the few &quot;archetype&quot; characters that are in this anime are parodies.  Shinpachi's sister Otae, for example, has the appearance of the typical &quot;sweet older sister&quot; character but she's actually one of the most violent characters in the entire series aside from trigger-happy Okita.  There is no &quot;self-righteous&quot; hero in this anime; every character is just another person trying to get by in the new Japan no matter how rude, weird, or downright strange he or she might be.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis is the first series that I have seen in a long time that has made me truly laugh-out-loud.  I sometimes even have to stop myself from laughing while reading the manga in study hall to avoid being stared at! \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nThe best thing about this anime is that it's not afraid to laugh at its demographic, its medium, its culture, or even itself.  It almost goes out of its way to make sure that it crosses the line.  And, even though some of the jokes are hit-or-miss references, it's an anime that can leave even new anime fans laughing or literally thinking, &quot;WTF?&quot;",

            "content": "I don't really know how to start this off, but here it goes...\r\nI first began this series out of complete boredom during the summer, but after wacthing the first couple episodes I thought to myself \" \r\nStory: The story is fantastic! Even though most of the episodes consits of crazy occurences that occurs with Gintoki and his friends (and shinsengumi), all the episodes are exciting and funny. But this series is not all fillers. There is a secret past with Gintoki and how he is connected to the previous war with the amatos (aliens) and samurais, and he encounters villians who try to harm tothe civilians, his friends, and/or Edo.\\n\\n\r\nArt &amp; Sound: The art is now more modern, and is just awesome. I feel like I am at Edo (In Gintama). The sound is great...I guess...I never really encountered an anime with bad sound (unless the DVD was scratched, or the web site was bad...)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: It's a rare cicrumstance, but I have fallen for all of the characters. All the characters have a goofy, distinguishable, but also serious side, and I absolutly love it! The character's have their own odd personalities (and fetishes). The character's a developed beautifully, and the characters give the show an unexplainable magic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Can I give this a 100/10? This series has action, comedy (A lot of it too), but the series has a couple of serious, and sad episodes. I cannot predict what will happen next! I look foward to wacthing the new episodes! If I didn't enjoy this, why would I be watching (and giving you guys a review)? If you watch this, you WILL enjoy this, no doubt about it!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: As you can see...I absolutly love this series. Do not miss out on this super-special-awesome (Sorry littlekuriboh) anime. There are many &quot;Japanese&quot; jokes, but everyone can love and enjoy this anime! I would give this a billion/10 for overall. I love this show with the bottom of my heart, and I know you will enjoy it too!!! (Watch a couple of episodes before you drop it, the first episode can be confusing)",

            "content": "Gintama is a peculiar type of anime. It's a mix of 90's shounens and comedy.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is not the main focus of Gintama. The sroty is divided into arcs. Evey Arc starts with disconnected episodes focusing on comedy and then, after some episodes,  it starts to dive in plot. This cicle repeats.\r\nThe comedy section oscillates between \"Amazing\" and \"Ok\". You cannot predict when you're going to get a funny episode and a shitty episode. Besides that, haf of the comedy comes from references to japanese pop culture and other animes, which most people won't get. \r\nStill, when Gintama is funny, it's really funny.\r\nThe Serioussection osclilates between \"Good\" and \"Ok\". It usually involves a recently introduced character... It still has funny segments, but not as many. it usually has a message or something to teach you, but it's not good enough on it's own. Nothing really happens and i wouldn't watch it if it wasn't for the comedy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nSuffices to say that the characters are complex and interesting. They're all diverse and memorable.\\n\\n\r\nOverwall, i think Gintama it's a great anime to watch casually. If you're feeling down, it can really light up your mood, and for that, i respect it.\\n\\n\r\nMy score is a 7. Not because it's bad, but because it oscillates too much. I recommend it to any anime fan. If you can keep following it, the comedy only gets better.\\n\\n\r\nThe point is: The comedy is it's highlight.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Gintama to be symbolized is like a bottle of fine apple cider. Its not the hot cinnamon one you enjoy at  winter time, but a bubbly and sweet drink enjoyed alongside some of the finest of your holiday wines.  Gintama is sweet. With a cast of bubbling and energetic characters who lift spirits. They just make the show sizzle with satisfying pops. At first Gintama feels like a kiddy drink laughable and nothing more. As you slow down and enjoy Gintama it becomes something more.  There is certain tartness mixed in, a hint of something more dramatic, this only materializes itself oncein a blue moon, yet you detected it. Its an edge darkness that only heightens the sweet bubble texture, it becomes a perfect balance of sweet and bubble with a hint of tart, resulting in something as great as the finest of wines . The over arching message of Gintama is to move on from the bad things and to work towards the good. Its to no matter what, through every trail and tribulation to live by your own \u201cbushido code\u201d. This is the morales of Gintama. Its 95% troll fun character shenanigans, 5% drama and dark morals. Yet, every bit of Gintma is a life lesson. Every episode and every title (some more troll than others). The fun episodes are meant to be enjoyed for fun. To tell you not to take life too seriously. The each drama arc is working through a hard time with respective values and morals. The fun episodes and dark episodes are both filled with pretty much the greatest comedy that the median of anime has produced. Using both mature and immature jokes, crude and clever, gags and satire, Gintama with comedy alone is a grand achievement. Yet on top it secedes in drama and truly great character interaction in a colorful world in which anything goes. This results in on of the greatest and most unique amines of all time (look at the damn scores).\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Gintama is about Gintoki Sakata after aliens have taken over the earth and life has generally improved for the world. Yet, a nasty sword ban on the public has put the samurai class out of work. Gintoki must now leave the bloody past behind and forge his own new samurai code as he does odd jobs in the city of Edo(Tokyo) and barely get by.  Gintama is mostly comedy following along the ways of the odd jobs crew, each episodes and odd job generally goes around their own little life lessons, gags and stories. The series is very episodic. This takes 95% of the series as fun day to day shenanigans in a world dominated by weird aliens (So not really average by our standards). Under all of the tomfoolery is a dark feel. Gintama portrays this very well and sometimes the feel of the show can switch on a whim. Its  the 5% not in the \u201chappy\u201d this  is very well thought out drama arcs usually every 20 episodes, with lengths usually 3 to 6 episodes long. These arcs usually start softly, but usually end up serious and involve Ghosts from Gintoki\u2019s past. This sense of past is never lost in the show, you always have a feeling that Gin cannot get over it.  It shows through continuously through his actions. Sometimes he stops when others laugh. He thinks back to his war days laughing with comrades and then frames back to his odd jobs crew and new friends; he smiles and joins back in. Gin has a very well hidden PTSD.  It mentioned by others, that he \u201chas the smell of a beast to him\u201d as when what he wishes to protect by his bushido code is threatened he\u2019ll revert the \u201cwhite demon\u201d (nick name in alien wars) and risk everything life and limb to save what he cares about. This is a feeling that is constant through the entirety of Gintama, and in a sense this getting over the bad times and the past is the central meaning of Gintama as a whole.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\tArt of Gintama is very interesting, very inventive devices, vibrant color palates; the world also can turn dark very quickly. It creates a vibrant fun colorful world that shows its seedy underside. This makes for some great contrasts in animation and just the faces\u2026 so good.  From troll faces to deadly serious, to plainly confused, Gintama mastered the art of drawing facial expressions. The style in itself isn\u2019t very risky and thus feels above average and not amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound is done by a variance of people. the Op\u2019s and Ed\u2019s are for a majority excellent. My personal Favorites from the 1st 201 episodes is the Op Donten with stairway generation being a close 2nd.  Osts are well-done; Madao is an excellent theme with slow guitar that makes you just feel.  Nothing though was completely off the walls amazing, but everything was great. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter truly is the greatness of Gintama. It\u2019s a plethora of colorful bubbles that light up the world. Each with their own past they also want to leave behind.  The Main Main group is the odd jobs crew lead by Gintoki Sakata, and his two employees/ apprentices Kagura and Shimpachi + their beloved mascot Saduharu . The other best group is the elite police of this crazy world. The Shinsengumi, which is mainly Hijikata, Sougo, Kondo, and Yamazaki.  The odd jobs team is like a family always together and always on each others nerves, but help when the time comes, this has created the best friendship speeches in existence. \u201cHe owns me five bucks\u2026 so I can\u2019t let him die\u201d. The odd jobs crew gallivants around the city of Edo.  Gintoki a samurai for a new age, Kagura super strong and supper witty  young girl, Shimpachi the only sane man here. It truly is a treat to watch. The Shensengumi also gallivant putting anti government rebellions down with ridiculous police work. They have the daemon vice- chief, the sadist Captain Sougo, the bland Yamazaki, the lovable idiot chief Kondo. They also have their own serious arcs and frequently end up with the odd job team by total accident in deadly situations.  These groups with many colorful separate friends and characters make a colorful dish the compliments the totally colorful world of Gintama creating tons of funny moments, and some sad ones too.  The characters of Gintama make this wacky world shine.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall Gintama is a mastery of comedy and drama. Truly meant to be enjoyed slowly. Something to be savored for what it is.  Its not one to be taken too seriously or too lightly. Yet, it is a one of the greatest things to come to the anime median to date. Funny and heart warming, and sometimes just sometimes dark and gritty with a touch of feels.  If you take your time to savor it, Gintama is one anime that you shant want to miss.\\n\\n\r\n-Raptor 9/10\\n",

            "content": "Gintama has become somewhat of a favourite amongst many in the anime community, as evident to anyone who views the Top Anime on MAL. However, does popularity directly correlate to quality? With a 5/10 rating, it's obvious my answer is no, but why exactly is that?\r\nThe series has a good start with it's interesting setting being a mix of Japanese history and sci-fi with a cast of colourful characters. After the first few episodes of character introductions, however, the story can be hit or miss at times...when it shows up. The plot continuity tends to be quite thin, with what is the main story onlyshowing up every dozen or several dozen episodes before being succeeded by episodic comedy arcs. This leaves the series feeling disjointed when it takes so long for what appears to be the core narrative is given a background seat constantly and the comedy dominates the series. It also doesn't help that when the serious arcs crop forward, the story seems to borrow too heavily from Rurouni Kenshin in many narrative elements, particularly concerning Gintoki.\\n\\n\r\nThis would be fine when the series brands itself as a comedy primarily, if not for three major factors. First would be the scope/length of the series. Pushing the main plot back somewhat in order to make the characters more entertaining would be fine if it was a short and concise series that got to the point. When your series is going on for several hundred episodes whilst building up several plot events and constantly shifting to a more serious tone when doing so yet taking too long to deliver, however, it's quite an inexcusable problem when most of the comedic arcs weren't essential for fleshing out the plot or characters. \\n\r\nThe second major flaw would be what the comedy consists of; referential humour. Whilst I got most of the references, even some of the more niche ones, and got a laugh out of them, I can't say it really makes for quality when by nature referential humour is directed at a select few and serves more to just advertise another series, which tends to make a series inferior to the one it's referencing by default due to the joke purely relying on the latter. The humour was fine for the first 40 or so episodes, where there was far more of a reliance on slapstick and the references were very subtle. When you get to characters exclaiming things such as \"Isn't this Dragon Ball?\" or calling out the reference in such an explicit manner lacks creativity and overall ruins the joke. Moreover, the constant need to make fun of other Shonen Jump titles comes off as quite a double-standard when the series is fine with overusing many Shonen tropes in the serious arcs such as power of friendship. It even comes off as bad world building when the vast differences in this world with aliens and Edo Period customs merged obviously wouldn't produce the same origin for ideas for many manga and therefore makes the references something that shouldn't be anything similar to what they were. \\n\r\nThis would be a poor nitpick in a typical comedy series that doesn't take itself seriously, but therein lies the third major flaw in the comedy, being tonal whiplash and inconsistency. When you go from a series that constantly changes reality through breaking the fourth wall that will all of a sudden become entirely serious and oblivious to such a fact about their comedic universe leaves the series inconsistent.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't the only comedic element of the series as the character interactions are quite funny at first...until the running gags get repeated far too much. It's fine having the joke of Kondo being a stalker repeated one or two times. Doing so about fifty or so times is annoying. The characters could make up for this with their personality and the writing behind them if not for the fact that, aside from Gintoki and perhaps Kagura, the main cast tend to only have one or two main character traits to remember them by whenever the arc isn't serious. Even for the more serious arcs, what character development occurs is never a permanent thing. An arc where Sougo learns to treat Hijikata with more respect? He's back to aiming a bazooka at him the next arc. An arc where Shinpachi is given the opportunity to grow as a person? He's going to be treat as just a pair of glasses in the next episode. The sexual tension between Gintoki and Tsukuyo in particular is quite the perpetual pile of nothing with neither taking the initiative, especially when the two are adults in their late twenties at least and not middle schoolers with a crush.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the superficial aspects of art and sound go, these are very good. The art and the usage of it's animation helps offer a lot of comedy from the purely physical gags as does the excellent voice acting with the seiyuu having such distinctive voices that their characters have truly become a part of them. The soundtrack is also great in it's variation that always manages to set the tone of the scene. Despite all that, these are just superficial aspects that don't act as much of a saving grace for the series.\\n\\n\r\nSo, overall, Gintama is a series that had many elements that could have been good had the execution of it's pacing and comedy been executed far better. Unfortunately, this didn't improve as the series went on and whilst the series is fine as pure entertainment, it certainly isn't the 10/10 many would hail it as. At least this first series is still better than the sequels to succeed it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for alternative recommendations, if you want a parody series that doesn't take itself seriously at all and remains dumb fun throughout, there's the series that likely inspired it Dr. Slump. If wanting a comedy series that offers more food for thought than a few jokes and have good pacing, there's The Tatami Galaxy and Great Teacher Onizuka, the latter of which does referential humour well by having a setting that would make it seem natural and doesn't overuse it.",

            "content": "My first review ever, and unfortunately a negative one, but i'll do my best to explain why i'm giving it such a score.\r\n* Story * [2/10]\r\nSince this is a comedy anime most episodes are loose and don't really have any important conection with each other, but sometimes there are some 'serious' arcs where story develops, so my rating is of those arcs.\r\nStory is generaly weak with no mindblowing twists, it wasn't as bad to watch as most episodes, but it was mostly the same formula as everything we have seen before, strong bad guy and good guy takes a good beating and then defeats thevilan, nothing special, even though the art is quite great, but i'll talk about that later.\\n\r\nThen we had some single episodes with a story within them, and these were realy poorly done, they broke the whole feels train by making a dumb unfunny joke while in the peak of the drama, and while the story of the episode was really good it was just plain ruined by them breaking the rhythm.\\n\\n\r\n* Art * [9/10]\\n\r\nCan't complain about anything, it was really good, the fights were very well animated and great artstyle.\\n\\n\r\n* Sound * [8/10]\\n\r\nHere im only going to talk about soundtracks, openings and endings, and i have once again nothing to complain here, openings were great, endings it has one of the greatest endings i have ever seen \"samurai heart\", and ost was on point most of the times.\\n\\n\r\n* Character * [2/10]\\n\r\nThis was one of the greatest downfalls for the anime in my opinion, let me state the anoying trifecta : Shinpachi, Otae and Sarutobi.\\n\r\nShinpachi: you know when you are telling a joke and the other person doesn't get it and you have to explain it making it really anoying, yeah, now imagine someone screaming the joke in your ears everytime a joke is said... yes, not very fun is it?\\n\r\nOtae: Typical strong femaly character beating up the MC, not much to be said.\\n\r\nSarutobi: It was an original character i'll give them that, but boy did it get repetitive, and when i say repetitive i mean repetitive, not to say the screaming wich seems to the only thing the anime thinks its funny for the viewers.\\n\r\nBuuuuuut, there were some funny characters that were *not* anoying in the little screen time they did manage to get, the shogun, hijikata, and gintoki, those were the characters that truly were funny whenever they were on screen, shame was that gintoki was many times overshadowed by shinpachi's screaming, ruining most jokes.\\n\\n\r\n* Enjoyment * [1/10]\\n\r\nScreaming, unfunny jokes, punching other people and such, unfortunately this was most of the episodes, out of the 300 episodes i've seen, i've only enjoyed and laughed at probably 20~30 wich is very bad, the reason why i kept going will be explained after. But it's not all bad news, some of the episodes i did enjoy i REALY enjoyed them, but they were so rare that watched gintama very very slowly, just when i had nothing else to watch.\\n\r\nThe humour was also very simple, no real complexity and as i stated before all the jokes are explained to you via screaming, wich as i said is not enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n* Overall * [2/10]\\n\r\nWhy did i watch it you ask? Well, bunch of reasons, first it was very high rated here and everyone seemed to love it to death, second i very rarely drop a show, third, people always said it would get better as time went by and unfortunatly it did not. I stated watching from episode 3 with an open mind and it was just a pain from beggining to the end. Unfunny jokes, screaming and punching is this show in a nutshell. In the end i think you either love or don't, as simple as that, if you plan on watching this, start on episode 3 and watch 3 or 4 episodes, if you simply did not enjoy at all, don't try watching this, if you liked go ahead, you won't be disapointed.\\n\r\nFor anyone wondering if i simply don't enjoy comedy shows, while not directly related i have watched simpsons, american dad, cleveland, southpark, and while yes these aren't anime, they are very well known comedy shows, and i thought for myself if i really liked all of these then i'd like gintama too, i didn't.\\n\r\nAnother thing i did was watch a youtube video of funny moments and most of those i laughed really hard, and those were basicaly the episodes i liked when i watched the whole thing, disapointing.",

            "content": "I've never really been a fan of long-running shounen anime. I had some bad run-ins with series like Naruto and Bleach when I was a kid and ever since then I've tried my best to stay away from them. For the same reason, I'm quite sure I would never have made myself watch Gintama either if it wasn't for its incredibly high ratings which made me feel somewhat obligated to. When I eventually started it though about 1,5 years ago, it was very quickly made evident that Gintama is... different. Not just different from other shounen anime, but different from almost every anime. In manyaspects it is more similar to western shows like The Simpsons or Family Guy, but still feels well and truly Japanese at the same time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros & Cons:\\n\\n\r\n+ Incredibly high peaks as far as comedy goes\\n\r\n+ Parodies anything and everything in brilliant fashion\\n\r\n+ Tons of diverse and original characters\\n\r\n+ Superb voice acting\\n\\n\r\n- Quite mediocre when the comedy misses its mark, or when it tries to be serious\\n\r\n- Not much of an overarching story\\n\r\n- Surprisingly poor video resolution for its airing time\\n\\n\\n\r\nTaking place in an alternate reality in feudal Japan where aliens have invaded and conquered everything, Gintama is a story about... yeah what is it about really? It primarily follows a freelance samurai named Sakata Gintoki as well as his two friends/coworkers, and shows how they manage to make a living in the crazy new world that their country has become. Primarily though the show does just about anything and everything you can possibly imagine as no matter how strange or far-fetched an idea may seem, it is never too far-fetched for Gintama. Entire episodes taking place inside toilet booths? Alien giants causing havoc in town due to their unfortunate extraterrestrial love lives? Having storylines based on the results of a character popularity poll the series once held in Japan? A hilarious degree of fourth-wall breaking? Gintama has it all. It's really something you need to experience for yourself in order to properly get an image of just how silly it can be.\\n\\n\r\nI'd like to say Gintama is *the* comedy anime that just about every anime fan can watch. With endless references to and parodies of hundreds and hundreds of other manga and anime, as well as an incredibly diverse sense of humour, it is highly unlikely that there won't be any point of the series that will be entertaining for any individual viewer, regardless of what their sense of humour may be like. The author seemingly knows perfectly how to appeal to almost any audience in this day and age as far as comedy goes, as the funny parts can go from being very complex and intelligent to being straight-up toilet humour. Because of this I'd also like to believe that the more anime/manga you've watched/read prior to watching Gintama, the more gags you will be able to understand and thus enjoy the series more. Thus this is not really an anime for newbies, but for anyone reasonably familiar with the anime industry then the sky is the limit.\\n\\n\r\nOf course as is always the case with comedy, it is somewhat hit or miss. What makes Gintama stand out however is how amazingly high its peaks actually are. Occasionally the show displays moments of absolute comedic genius, as when Gintama is at its best it is probably the funniest anime ever made. Because of this there are certain individual episodes that stand out as some of the overall best episodes I have ever seen. It's physically impossible for *everything* to be funny however, and with such an enormous amount of gags there will still sadly be an overwhelming amount of time that will not entertain you. And given how incredibly long the anime is, when you put it in that sort of context you'll unfortunately realize that the amount of mediocre hours that Gintama contains is actually extremely high.\\n\\n\r\nCase in point; Gintama is the most inconsistent anime I have ever seen to this day. It is a series that sometimes will make you cry with laughter, and sometimes bore you out of your mind. The comedic elements aside, it also has its fair share of more typical battle shounen-esque story arcs spanning a couple of episodes every so often. Ironic as it is, this is probably the biggest weakness of the entire show. When the series goes into a more serious mode it quite frankly feels more like a chore to watch through than anything else a lot of the time. While the story arcs generally aren't bad per se, they're nowhere even close to the same level as the better comedy episodes are. Like I mentioned before, the stereotypical long-running shounen series are not anything I enjoy very much at all, and thus when Gintama enters a similar sort of atmosphere it just comes across as a massive drop in quality for a couple of episodes. Of course once it's done with that part then it might immediately peak up to masterpiece-level again, it happens more than once throughout the series' progression. Like I said, extremely inconsistent.\\n\\n\r\nAs you might expect from such a huge series, the character cast of Gintama is massive. In addition to our silver-haired Shounen Jump-addicted samurai protagonist Gintoki, there's also the super strong humanoid alien Kagura who can eat an infinite amount of food and always wears a China dress, as well as the ultra-tsukkomi character Shinpachi who on his spare time is the captain of a famous pop-singer's personal fan club. The supporting cast consists of a guy who never gets his name said correctly, a super sadist, a mayonnaise-addicted freak, an old hag of a landlady, a ginormous dog, a 180 centimeters tall white penguin-like... \"thing\" who communicates by writing on signs, as well as several hundreds of others. There's an endless amount of characters to familiarize yourself with but given how long the anime is there's plenty of time for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation though... taking its time of airing into account it's honestly rather poor. For a series that finished as late as 2010 it still utilizes a 4:3 aspect ratio for the full duration of the show. Really? That aside the character designs are pretty clean and distinct, and the animations themselves are passable at least. I still feel that the show is a couple years behind as far as the technical levels go however, which may or may not be bothersome depending on whom you ask.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very good however. Since the series is sometimes dramatic and sometimes about as non-serious as you can possibly get, it's pretty important that the music manages to reflect that diverse atmosphere in order to not drag it down, and it succeeds in doing this quite excellently. I don't think there was a single moment during these full 201 episodes where the audio ever felt truly out of place. The opening and ending themes are naturally in the double digits given the series' length, some of them being pretty awesome, and some of them were pretty meh.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really stands out though is the voice acting. Now I haven't read the manga but as far as I've been told the main reason the anime is so much higher rated than the manga is because of this very reason. The effort put in by many of the voice actors/actresses is phenomenal, and it helps emphasize and exaggerate the gags immensely. I can only imagine how much less interesting many of the jokes in Gintama would have been if the people speaking them had been half-assing it, but as it is it's something that really deserves some special credit. I'd especially give a shoutout to Sugita Tomokazu's versatile performance as Gintoki as well as Sakaguchi Daisuki's incredible tsukkomi role as Shinpachi, which never fails to entertain and impress you. And if you thought Kugimiya Rie could only do loli tsundere characters, well think again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, in the end it comes down to a numbers game for me. All the good aspects aside, the bottom line is still that sometimes the show is a comedic masterpiece, and sometimes it's a quite stereotypical and boring shounen series. Therefore trying to judge the entire anime with a single number feels a bit wrong to me, as sometimes I want to give it a 10 and sometimes more like a 5. But if I have to give it some sort of average, then in the end I'll have to resort at keeping it at a 7. As it is, despite the incredibly high peaks the anime has, it is still sadly outnumbered by the number of quite average episodes that will mostly fail to make you laugh. Of course it probably depends a lot on how you weigh quality versus quantity so I'm sure different people will find this fact to be more or less of an issue than others.\\n\\n\r\nGintama is perhaps the most famous comedy anime in existence and not without good reason. It is the one show that can and will make fun of anything and everything, and do so in style. It also probably has the highest peaks I have ever seen in comedy, and at times it can literally make you laugh until you cry. Unfortunately it doesn't do this quite as often as I would like, and a lot of the time it feels like you're drumming your fingers on the table in impatience while waiting for the show to get back into its element again.\\n\\n\r\nHowever seeing as humour is one of the most subjective aspects of the human mind, I would still recommend essentially everyone to at least try watching Gintama (though perhaps not quite yet if you're still very new to anime). It takes a while before the show really gets going and even when it does it is still very up and down. That being said I know that there are a lot of people who found themselves seemingly rolling on the floor laughing during just about every episode of this anime, so who knows; maybe you'll be one of them too? I can't make any promises but as long as the potential exists that Gintama may be the most humorous experience of your life then I would eagerly recommend you to at least give it a chance. I mean what could there possibly be to lose?",

            "content": "At first I was very skeptical towards the idea of watching this anime. For you see, to watch Gintama one must have a profound knowledge on Japanese pop-culture and language (as the show doesn't lack puns and references), none of which I have. Nevertheless, if you are one to appreciate a good laugh and a chaotic story line, Gintama is the anime for you.\r\nMy opinion on this show:\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nI can't help it but admire the author's ingenious approach towards not only fiction, history and adventures the characters come by, as well as the daily life of Ooedo inhabitants and all their small problems (e.g. theups and downs of having to buy a new fan or when a young girl wants her undergarments washed separately from her father's). In the Gintama world, there are hardly any linearities. Even an everyday story will make a twist or turn somewhere until the end of the 20-minute episode. And it is most likely that the aforementioned twist will make you shed tears from laughter.\\n\r\nThe show is also overflowing with d*ck jokes, b*tt jokes and the likes... Not to mention famous shounen manga, famous actors, etc. Nevertheless, toilet humor is an inseparable part of Gintama.\\n\\n\r\nOf course Gintama also has its seriousness, as you will notice when you stumble across the small \"arcs\", sometimes revealing dark secrets from the characters' pasts and adding for a more thrilling experiences. At those times, Gintama may turn its back on humor for a while, to unsheathe its blade, but that doesn't mean it's utterly forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I gave it 9 (although my overall score is 10) is that a really small part of the characters' pasts is revealed. Imo, that's a turf many things could be explored on.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is very well drawn, with nicely balanced colors and fitting for the pseudo-historical Japan landscapes. The characters are also well drawn, each with unique features, more than enough to distinguish them. The motions are especially well made, though not too frantic or annoying for the viewer's eye. The camera angle is also great, at times even stunning as it adds for more laughter or sharpens the breath-taking moment, depends on the case. There's more to add about the character design, but I'll do that later, when I share my impression on the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I gave it 10? I am particularly an appreciator of good art, especially the characters, and this is one of the few shounen titles from what I've seen that has such a good style; they are not deformed, annoying (most of them) or made with the same template.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nGintama hooked me on the first opening, if it hadn't already with its synopsis (more like, the lack of it) ...and I was shocked when I realized it's made by Tommyheavenly6. Then, I thought to myself, this anime means serious business. Before I used to weigh anime on their openings and endings and more or less that hasn't changed much (although now there are many more things I judge in an anime). After all, OPs and EDs made 1/10 of the screen time of an episode and the OP creates your first impression of that anime. So far for 252 episodes Gintama hasn't got a weak opening. And as a matter of fact a weak ending. And those openings usually catch perfectly the overall idea of the show. If you are keen on watching this series and want to know what it's about, one glimpse at the opening would be worth a thousand reviews read. The opening can tell you straight away who are the main characters, what other characters you are to expect, what are their occupation or preferences (oft times the right word is obsession), their affections, friends, bonds, where they live... and what the story is about, but that could be described with one word: mayhem.\\n\\n\r\nGintama has OPs and EDs in J-Rock style, usually with upbeat sound, funky at times, with lots of guitars. The rhythm is quite catchy, so listening to them at least twice is a must. The soundtrack of both seasons is composed by Audio Highs, also with lots of guitars for the pressure moments, piano for the sad moments and drums for the punch lines. Audio Highs' themes are styled in almost perfect synchronization with the emotion charges a scene in Gintama could carry.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 11/10\\n\\n\r\nGintama's character design is unique and I'm not talking solely for the silver-haired \"tennen-paama\" protagonist, although he is surely unmistakable with his bokutou and the manner he wears his kimono. All the characters are drawn as befits their roles in the anime, more or less, with lots of imagination poured into each of them and a feature (usually more than one) to distinguish them from the others. Also all the characters' seyuu fit more than perfect, as they have a diapason large enough to make any situation even more comical or sh*t serious. There are no banal characters, for each has it's own story to tell and contributes on their own way for the story; and last but not least - there's no character that's out of place in Gintama. Although most of them complain they aren't given enough screen time and the show is as random as it gets, with more people appearing every episode, the secondary characters pop up just when you though they were forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are probably the thing I enjoyed most at the anime. As ridiculous as it sounds, they are all unique, as each of them has it's own backstory, a manner of speaking, dressing, preferable meals and many more, but most importantly: bonds. All these small features make the character stand out, not like some shallow figures, that stand there to fill the plot; and make it truly a \"person\" to sympathize to.\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 10/10\\n\r\nI truly enjoyed every bit of this anime and this review is pretty much valid for both seasons. I only want to add that, as an anime based on manga, it boldly adds its own brush strokes, such as complaining about sponsors and producers, or making top 50 most popular characters show.  Where some people would consider this fillers, it merges with the story so swiftly that not even once it annoyed me; on the contrary, it makes it more vivid and diverse than you would expect from an anime based on manga.\\n\r\nThere are many other things I wanted to say, but I either forgot as I typed or just decided it was long enough the way it is.\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review and hope it was convincing enough to make you watch Gintama!~",

            "content": "Before I write this review which is very long overdue I would like to first establish that Gintama is my favourite series in both the manga and anime mediums and it is something that I will carry with me forever, it took me out of a very dark part in my life and set me on the right path. Gintama is something that becomes better as time moves on and you learn more about Japanese culture (of course, manga and anime) looking back at the series but it is also a very compelling story with slowly arching storyline with some really emotional moments and justsome moments that really hit home to any anime watcher. \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, I would like to note that Gintama is the funniest form of media (at least anime) that I have seen. I don't think that people quite appreciate the knowledge that the author (who refers to himself as a Gorilla in the manga) has, he is thoroughly up to date with todays manga and anime series, with American TV shows, to Japanese Pop artists and Idols, and to Japanese comedy all together. He is a true appreciator of comedy and this is very apparent in his series where he runs jokes sometimes volumes apart, he has running gags throughout the series and he ties in references to all works of media that his wide audience (most of the time) appreciates.\\n\\n\r\n-Just going to do a quick overview and reasoning for my 10/10 on all scores for the anime-\\n\\n\r\nStory: Gintama starts as a bunch of friends in the Edo period of Japan start up an \"odd jobs\" with the intent on doing any job for anyone around the town  after the alien \"amanto\" take over the Earth for a low price to get by. They start making associates in all kinds of places from the \"Joi\" terrorists to the various policing organisations around the place to the Shogunate itself, with the more relationships that they build the more influence and responsibility the group gathers around the town, the several ties made really bring together the story; this story isn't really your general soul searching, power gaining Shonen, it is about protecting these ties with everything that the group has.\\n\\n\r\nArt: With such an amazing source I do feel that Sunrise did a very good job animating Gintama. Character designs  stay very true to their original sources and they did a very nice job giving you a feel as to what it would be like living in this run down town where Aliens and Humans live (seemingly) in harmony. The action scenes are done very - very well and the various \"playful\" facial expressions and such are done to perfection.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Gintama has quite a range of different scenarios and I think that the sound put together did very well at setting the tone for these scenarios. It has some very touching songs for those emotionally beautiful scenes, it has some really cool fighting music when necessary and some very comical jigs for the right moment. Another strong point in Gintama is its OPs and EDs, they really do get some amazing bands (SPYAIR does a few) in for these theme songs and they stay very true to the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Gintama has some very loveable characters, they each play their comical role very well with their interactions with certain characters, one thing that I've noticed is how well Sorachi pairs certain characters with one another in both the humorous sense and in a social one. You also need to appreciate that every supporting character is either introduced during the series with some sort of arc that very closely ties each character with the group or they are done so in the same way with a flashback.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Due to its episodic nature Gintama is something that you can show to friends at any point and they will love it all the same. As touched on earlier it is such an enjoyable series because of its diversity, there is something in it for everyone of all ages because the authors knowledge in anything funny is so diverse all the same. Watch it for the endless references, the fighting scenes, the comedy, you will not leave disappointed whatever your interests are.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude in my bias I just really want to stress that everyone no matter what their tastes are should watch Gintama, don't get strayed away by these  premise that because it is on the MAL top anime ratings that it must be mainstream trash. It is there for a reason, everyone that watches it loves it.",

            "content": "\"Listen up! Let's say you drink too much strawberry milk, and have to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. But it's cold outside your bed. You don't want to get up, but the urge to urinate is just too strong! You make up your mind to go! You run to the bathroom, stand in front of the toilet, and let loose! You think that all your life has led to this moment! But then you realize! It isn't the bathroom, you're still in bed! That feeling of lukewarm wetness spreads like wildfire! But you don't stop! You can't stop! That's what I'mtalking about! THAT'S THE TRUTH OF THE STRAWBERRY MILK! DO YOU GET IT!?\"\\n\r\n-Sakata Gintoki, 2006\\n\\n\r\nWhen talking about anime, easily one of the most popular and prolific genres is the battle shounen. Two guys with muscles bigger than their heads screaming at the top of their lungs while beating the hell out of each other for seven hours seems to never get old within the anime community. Time and time again the genre has proven itself to not only be extremely popular, with the recent explosion of interest surrounding Boku no Hero Academia, but also very commercially viable, hence why so many get made and why many feel so mass produced. It's one of the first things that the general public thinks of when they hear anime, aside from, y'know, underage school girls with breasts bigger than their heads who want to have sex with strange tentacle monsters! In fact, I actually asked my Mother what she thought about anime, being that she knows virtually nothing, and she told me that whoever was into that kind of stuff must be some kind of strange social weirdo, as she looked me dead in the eyes, obviously disappointed that her Son is a filthy weeb who faps to Love-Live doujins. But, I digress! Over the years however, long-form running shounen adaptations have been heavily stigmatised by fans and for perfectly good reason. Not only is the sheer length of these shows intimidating, but since the anime is usually still running alongside its manga adaptation, the anime will often have to resort to using filler in order to let the manga run head, with Naruto being the all-time world champion of this, cutting back to filler even when the manga was over and there was no reason to do so! Most long-form running shounen as well typically are accused of falling apart as they go along, with greater plot holes, strange changes in tone from the original which doesn't sit too well with fans, and an abundance of animation errors and inconsistencies due to the constant working of the show.\\n\\n\r\nHowever Gintama, despite it being a long-form running shounen with over three-hundred episodes, is still one of the most beloved and critically acclaimed anime out there, despite itself being one of the longest running anime around, with pretty much every season dominating the top anime lists here on this website. My score for this review as well also indicates that I agree with much of the critical acclaim behind Gintama, to a certain extent anyway. But, why exactly is that? What does Gintama do that over long-form shounen fail at? Well, let's see if I can answer why in this review! Let's grab our wooden katana, take up some random odd job and dive into the bat-shit world that is Gintama!\\n\\n\r\nThe Amanto, aliens from the far reaches of outer space, have invaded Japan, ending the age of the samurai, and a prohibition of swords has been put in place, but, despite this, several people still carry the spirit of the samurai in their hearts. One such person just happens to be our protagonist, a man by the name of Sakata Gintoki, who, despite constant gambling, drinking and all around being a rather useless member of society, carries on the will of the samurai. Not only that but Gintoki runs his own business taking on various odd jobs, along with a young girl by the name of Kagura, an extremely strong alien from the Yato clan, and Shinpachi, the straight man, otaku of the series. The show sees them taking on various jobs and the such in an insane and over the top fashion, while, at the same time, having to fight anyone who threatens their way of life. Talking about Gintama's plot is rather difficult, not because it is filled with allegorical writing or symbolism, but because of the unconventional narrative structure, the show has when compared to a typical shounen series. As such, fans of the show have dubbed each story arc into one of two categories. The \"serious arcs\" and the \"comedy arcs\". While Gintama does have an overall narrative that explodes in latter seasons resulting in a plethora of character deaths and fights, it is extremely subtle. Every so often we'll see glimpses of the antagonists in the background, plotting out some kind of plan or getting together allies for their army, and even getting involved in the more serious arcs of the show. Gintama is far more comedy focused than anything else, and will constantly switch between the serious and comedic arcs, but what makes this work is that it never feels as if the comedy is intrusive on any of the more serious moments. There is enough downtime between each major event to never make the comedy feel jarring, which is actually a problem I had in the later seasons of the show since they tried to combine both and it came across as rather forced and strange. However, despite the lack of an overall narrative, for the most part, the comedy arcs never feel like filler or just pointless ways to stretch out the story. Every arc we at least learn something new about the characters or their relationship, which makes them feel more than just simple comedic gags; the show has enough energy and charisma to keep everything entertaining throughout its entire run. The setting of Gintama as well is used to full effect in order to create interesting scenarios and story arcs. Also, since the comedy arcs allow us to learn more about the characters and bond with them too, this creates a greater sense of urgency and narrative tension during the more serious arcs, where everyone's life is in danger, with intense and well-animated samurai fight scenes with plenty of blood and emotional weight. It's this constant cathartic pay-off from the comedic hijinks to the climax of the serious arcs which is what makes Gintama so incredibly addicting to watch and marathon. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the most generic pieces of criticism I see in regards to the comedy of Gintama is that it is filled with nothing but referential humour. While I personally don't have a problem with references, since a well-timed reference can create a greater connection between the audience and the work at hand, and some of the parodies in Gintama can be pretty well done, I can understand why people are not a fan of this. For starters, references can't stand on their own since they are using other pieces of work to build the comedy around, but they're also limited in their appeal. Some fans may not even get the reference or parody and as a result, may not find the joke funny, and even if you're well-versed in anime knowledge, Gintama makes countless references to Japanese TV shows which more often than not, alienates the viewer. Of course, the anime is marketed towards Japanese viewers so I'm not going to accuse the show of having too obscure references, but for western viewers, it's something to point out. Even when the subtitles attempt to explain the joke and reference, it ends up killing the flow of the episode since you have to stop and read it all, which, more often than not, fills the entire screen with explanations, and being told why a joke is funny is far less funny than experiencing the joke for yourself. However, to say that the entirety of Gintama is based around references and parodies would not be an accurate statement, since most of the comedy is derivative of the character interactions and the absurd scenarios the characters find themselves in.\\n\\n\r\nGintama's cast of characters is HUGE! As a result, it creates an insane amount of comedic possibilities and interactions since each character has their own unique quirk. There are so many characters in the show that it would be impossible to go through them all, but each one, at the very least, brings something new to the table, and are all fundamentally flawed characters. What I mean by that is, that none of the characters are actually what you would consider 'good people'. Take Gintoki for example. While he does have a set of morals that he abides by, and when push comes to shove he will do the right thing and try to help people in trouble, he is a lazy adult who gambles for most of the day, gets drunk frequently, is always late to pay the rent and overall does some sleazy things. But what makes Gintoki hilarious is the fact that is flawed, and thus relatable, always getting some form of punishment for whatever he does, which feels satisfying to watch. Gintoki's character is easily one of my favourite anime characters ever, with his screaming in response to situations of danger are always enough to make me burst out laughing and his sarcasm is something that I adore. Gintoki also was a fierce samurai who thought on the front lines against the Amanto invasion, and the show gives us little hints into the war that transpired in the past, but, in typical Gintama fashion, every time they are about to go into detail of the event, they essentially troll us and make a joke instead, although eventually, we do learn about the specifics of what happened in the later seasons.\\n\\n\r\nThe other two main characters, who work with Gintoki, as previously mentioned, are Kagura and Shinpachi, and the three together have fantastic chemistry, being able to hold whole episodes together just by themselves. Shinpachi is more so the straight man for the series, which makes him the most relatable as a result, as we experience the story through his eyes; a voice of rationality in this insane world we're presented with, although he does break away from this shell many times to play one of the more eccentric characters, especially in the otaku arc where he is battling against other filthy weebs to become the number one fan of a popular idol in the show. Typically, Shinpachi is the butt of the joke in plenty of scenarios, and due to his straight man personality, many of the characters forget he exists, and all they remember about Shimpachi is his glasses, which makes for plenty of funny re-occurring jokes down the line. Finally, of the main trio, we have Kagura, a young child from the Yato clan, an extremely powerful race of Amanto, who came to Earth in order to send money back to her father, giving her character a bit more emotional depth, although she spends most of her time playing. She actually forms an odd, younger-sister relationship with Gintoki (don't worry, it's no Eromanga-sensei \"odd\"), and even though she doesn't show her affection very often, there are plenty of subtle little hints that she cares deeply for him, adding onto her character and these scenes where she exhibits this characteristic are genuinely charming. Together, the trio forms sort of a dysfunctional family, with Gintoki being the head, and this family dynamic actually develops and grows during the course of the series as each character begins to bond closer together other the more serious arcs where the narrative stakes are much higher.\\n\\n\r\nThere are dozens of characters in the show and if I were to talk about them all I'd be here to the end of time! At the very least, each character gets to shine in their own respective story arc(s) and each one carries their own catchphrases and re-occurring gags that go through a snowball effect, in that they become all the funnier as the show goes along and the scenarios become even more silly and over the top. Some of the best examples include Hasegawa, a man who becomes homeless and, despite his best efforts to find work, he gets fired every time and lives in a cardboard box - he is essentially like Gil from the Simpsons, the Shinsengumi, the police of Gintama, comprised of a heavy smoker vice-captain who is addicted to mayonnaise and will eat it with anything, a first division captain who is a sadist and a commander who is a Gorilla and the rebel group led by an absolute idiot called Katsura along with his assistant, Elizabeth, who is a man dressed up in a duck outfit, all of which Katsura doesn't realise. Each character's personality trait I just mentioned all greatly benefit from this snowball effect and each characteristic keeps building up upon itself, getting funnier and funnier each time they're on screen. Gintama also takes some of the most mundane ideas for jokes and turns them into something hilarious by constant build up. Take, for example, a scene that I and one of my friends love, The Toilet Battle scene. In this scene, five characters go to the bathroom in five stalls next to each other, all of which have no toilet paper. From there, it becomes a twenty minute psychological battle of lies and deception, as each character tries to manipulate each other into using sandpaper as a substitute for toilet paper, and there are many other scenes like this that keep building upon itself in hilarious ways! A lot of what makes the show pretty funny as well is the over the top close-up reaction images of all the characters, which was something I also commented on in my Cromartie High School review, and Gintama has practically mastered the art of this, with some of the funniest and most detailed close-up shots around.\\n\\n\r\nGintama also makes it a habit of breaking the fourth wall constantly, by addressing the audience and making fun of itself every step of the way too. Gintoki often complains, as the series goes along, that the popularity for Gintama is declining and the time slots for the show were moved later into the night, with him breaking down and crying over this fact which is delightfully entertaining. In some instances, Gintoki and Shinpachi depicted as real models, visit the real Studio Sunrise, the studio responsible for creating the show. While they explore the insides of the studio, they remark about how messy the place is, how lazy each member of the team is and actually come across the producer laying down on his desk, as they remark that his wife has recently cheated on him which is why he is so depressed. The entire anime is completely self-aware of how stupid it actually is and goes full out with this fact at every opportunity and it seems the people behind this are having an absolute blast creating the show. The voice actor's performances are also fantastic and really sell the comedy of the show. Sugita Tomokazu's performance of Gintoki is probably the best role he has ever done and does an amazing job in conveying Gintoki's personality and the screaming Gintoki does is wonderfully hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nGintama isn't completely flawless, however. For starters, the anime often utilises rather vulgar comedy with plenty of characters being stripped of their clothing, with a mosaic covering their genitals, along with some unfunny dick and poop jokes that feel rather juvenile, and some of the comedy can downright feel unfunny and fall flat on its face. Depending on how much you enjoy this sort of comedy, this can be a bad thing or a good thing. Also, during the more serious arcs in the show, it can fall into some of the trappings that come with your typical battle shounen series with Gintoki delivering quite the number of inspirational lines before dealing a finishing blow to his opponent, which kind of does get old the more he does it. Gintama doesn't exactly have the greatest start either, with it taking a few episodes to build up some steam and personality, and the very first two episodes of the show are awful. Essentially, they're the only two filler episodes in the show (in the case that they are not adapted from the original manga) and is a strange one hour special that is not funny, confusing and boring to watch. At episode three the story basically starts, so I'd just recommend skipping the first two. As previously mentioned too, the parodies and references to shows can sometimes feel a little too overly abundant, and some of the parodies either completely go over my head or simply are not that funny. However, these moments were few and far between for me, and most of the problems never ruined the entire experience for me.\\n\\n\r\nGintama's animation is pretty consistent throughout with some minor hiccups here and there, due to the sheer length of the series; for a long-running shounen adaptation, the anime looks good from a visual standpoint, and really shines during some of the fight scenes, especially in the Yoshiwara in Flames arc, which is one of my personal favourite anime story arcs of all time! The animation in the arc looks amazing, especially during the fight between Gintoki and Hosen. The entire arc is tense, suspenseful, full of emotional weight, and develops Kagura's and Shinpachi's characters very well. Gintama's soundtrack is also pretty damn good, with each track fitting the tone of each scene and arc very well, and, with eight openings and ten endings, I'm sure you'll find one that you like, although a couple of the tracks can sound a little too similar. Opening five and six are easily my favourite, with opening five's dark imagery and tone fitting well with that found in the Shinsengumi Crisis Arc that it was used for. Gintama plays around a lot with different animation styles and experiments a lot as well, most particularly a scene in the anime where only the outlines have been drawn and Gintoki complains about the laziness of the staff in episode 94, and in the Popularity Poll arc, where Shinpachi runs between different storyboards, as we see the animation and art style change constantly, from Fist of the North Star to Dragon Ball Z. The staff even re-drew the eighth opening all in paint, as Shinpachi remarks before the credits that the show's budget is decreasing! There was so much effort put into making the show both as visually appealing and visually funny as possible.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you couldn't tell from my praise, I love Gintama, and it stands above most long-form running shounen for its quality and consistently funny arcs, combined with its emotionally heavy serious arcs.  Gintama is one of the few pieces of media that has actually made me laugh hysterically on many an occasion, and I would highly recommend this show, despite the length. Its characters are all charismatic and funny, each bringing something new to the table, the comedy, for the most part, is pretty strong and consistent, and this is some of the most fun I've ever had with an anime! Its second season is even better than the first as well for having much better animation, and funnier episodes, while presenting it all in a much more easy to digest 50 episodes. For a good representation of what Gintama is actually about, go and check out the ninth opening of the show (the first from the second season) as it combines the goofy antics and serious nature of Gintama perfectly in ninety seconds. As I said before, comedy is completely subjective, and I know for a fact my taste in comedy is strange as hell, so perhaps there might be some people who would look at me and think I'm nuts for finding it so funny, and that's completely fine! Check it out for yourself at some point; who knows, you may end up thinking it is funny too!\\n",

            "content": "Story (5.1) - I have to say...its very confusing, and really hard to find connections in gintama between the episodes..sometimes there arent any..well, this aspect doesnt matter since the others are better.\r\nBasically, Gintoki was once a samurai who fought for edo...and still continues to fight, on hiw own way, helping others and saving the world from alliens (sometimes). With the help of shinpachi, kagura, shinsengumi and some other characters, they will \r\nget in all kind of situations.\r\nArt (9.8) - Art is outstanding!! I really like it.. Gintoki looks so great, also, the shinsengumi are something that made me laugh all the time, especially Hijikata-Okita-Kondo..Shinpachi andhis sister comes right behind, and kagura as well. In my opinion, design is very appropiatte for this kind of anime, and also the surroundings (environment, town, etc..) are very well made and gives the exact idea of some aspects. Indeed amazing how the characthers change expressions and their feelings, and art express that very well indeed, and also gives you a lot of comic moments. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8.6) - Op and Ed are great, i liked it..besides, it fits really well with the type of anime. I&acute;ve seen better in this aspect, but this one still is good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacther (10.0) - Well, i cant give less than a 10...Each character is really unique..there are a lot of them who makes me laugh all the time, and its impressive how some characthers suddenly pass from a comic mood to a serious mood, and vice-versa. Originality is very very high. \\n\r\nThey are really well devellopped and i have nothing negative to point here, so a 10.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment ( 10.0) - well, what can i say, i surrender ! There are some episodes who blow the ratings, some of them i cant give 10...i have to say its more than 10.. some of them make fun of some other anime and manga, others show ridicullous situations that makes me laugh for 20 mins non stop.. And there are also some serious episodes, where the characthers show their amazing abilities..impressive.\\n\r\nGintoki is really outstanding, for me one of the best characthers ever, there are only a few who beat him in my ranking. Shinsengumi, well, maybe this is actually my favourite group of characthers, i mean, there arent anything like shinsegumi in any other anime i saw..gintoki-kagura-shinpachi gets close, some others from other anime also, but i dont remember to see a group at the same time so fun and hilarious xD. \\n\\n\r\nhow can i give less than 10.0? its impossible.\\n\\n\r\noverall (9.5) - Story is the only problem in gintama, with some story and this one would be for me the best ever made without discussion..but as it is, its defenitively 1 of my favourite, and the n&ordm; 1 in comedy anime for sure..The other aspects are incredible, i recommend to everyone. If you like comedy, then dont search anymore...you just found it, gintama is the best choice ;)\\n",

            "content": "Take samurai, aliens, robots, unrealistic animals, a whole bunch of randomness and throw them into an Edo period-like setting and you'll have Gintama.  Gintama combines a lot of things that should not be combined, it breaks all the rules and crosses all borders in how a story should be told.  However, Gintama does this extremely well and each episode never fails to have its watchers in stitches of laughter with its outrageous situations.\r\nStory - 10/10\r\nStory? What story? There is absolutely no plot to Gintama, its episodic humour that outlines the daily life of an odd jobs freelancer Sakata Gintoki and his two 'employees',the four-eyed useless guy, Shimura Shinpachi and the kung fu China girl, Kagura.  The three of them take up odd jobs from searching for lost pets to fighting dangerous evil aliens in order to pay off their rent.  Although Gintama does not follow any specific plot, its humour is what makes it top notch, with the amount of humour this anime delivers, a plot isn't even needed.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\nLike with most long running anime, the art starts off rather bad, but does show noticeable improvement along the way.  A particular feature I like about Gintama is the way the scenery is done, the houses, shops and clothes remind the watchers that the anime is set in an era that resembles the Edo period.  However, things like aliens, mutated beasts, drink machines, scooters, bazookas etc also give Gintama a modern/futuristic feel.  The art, character-wise is also very well done, the facial expressions in particular amplifies the humour or joke being told when necessary.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nThe OP and ED themes ranged from upbeat and catchy songs to slower more mellow tunes, Gintama has a good range of catchy openings that will remain in your head after the 20 or so episode they appear for.  BGM-wise, was also very well done, the silly sounding ones were played at the appropriate times and the same goes for serious, wild sounding ones, the BGM went well with the moment/scene in the episode most of the time.  The Otsu idol songs were a bonus in my opinion, they were really original and weird with crazy lyrics but did wonders for the humorous side of things in Gintama.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters really bring out Gintama, each character has a unique trait that makes them stand out from the rest of the other characters.  I really liked how the characterisation was done, the innocent and kind looking characters end up being the complete opposite of their appearance.  Throughout the anime, the majority of characters are well explored to reveal an underlying side of their personality which makes them more awesome than they were before.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall - 10/10\\n\r\nGintama is definitely one of the most hilarious anime I\u2019ve ever come across, although the amount of episodes it has may seem daunting, Gintama is an anime that is very easy to fall in love and get addicted to.  It's an anime that brings humour to a whole different level with its never ending parodic references and the odd adult joke.",
