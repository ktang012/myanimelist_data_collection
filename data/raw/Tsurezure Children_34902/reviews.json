The art is great which doesn't really matter in this kind of show in my opinion but its a never a negative. It's just super satisfying to watch. If you are sick of romance or harem shows not ever going anywhere, crack open a cold one and let you soul be sated by some great conclusions with great lovable characters.\r\nEach set is somewhat repetitive,\r\n\"I like you\"\r\n\"There's no way they actually like me\" \r\nbut the characters are all verydifferent and just seeing them interact makes you happy for some reason. The comedy is surprisingly well done as well which just adds to the great emotional swings they throw at you.",

            "content": "\u201cI love you\u201d is perhaps one of the most complex combination of words in the human language. It holds a special meaning for people of any age and for teenagers, that\u2019s no overstatement. Tsurezure Children takes the idea of romance and brings it out like skits of human stories. It\u2019s a definitely a series that I found charming and doesn\u2019t even to be full length to show that.\r\nAs a fan of the manga, I originally had mixed expectations for this adaptation. The manga has over 140 chapters and ongoing. Each chapter is only a few pages long and it would feel like the show mayhave some difficultly to transform this into anime form. However, the first few episodes easily convinced me that this anime has what it takes to set the bar for a rom-com. At its core, Tsurezure Children is about relationships of young people. There is quite a diverse range of characters and some of the couples really stand out compared to others. What really made me appreciate the show is how smooth the story flowed with the characters. Despite just being half length, it doesn\u2019t waste time to showcase character pairings. It mixes character drama, humor, realism, and romance altogether. \\n\\n\r\nThe show has a very colorful cast with all sort of characters. It has childhood friends, a tsundere, a delinquent, dominant guys, class representatives, stoic girl, drama club leaders, club members, etc. It\u2019s like bringing together all the gimmicks you remember from high school days and stick them together. Of course, this invites all sorts of personalities into the show as well. What I find highly entertaining about the couple pairings is that all of them can be relatable. Think of your days when you were in school and the times when you had a crush on someone. If you look at the show from the characters\u2019 perspective, it can feel like you\u2019re there with them. And to be honest, I think that\u2019s what makes this series really fun to watch. Romance is a very complex theme that has no real answer. Love is a very powerful emotion and this show explores that in many ways. Expect to hear confessions often and this show is not afraid to pull the trigger often between pairings.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the drama, the show is actually very lighthearted and comedy plays a big role to entertain the viewers. It\u2019s very gimmicky with characters showing attraction towards each other in their pairings. Rather than forcing humor down viewers\u2019 throats, it comes out very naturally. Individually, the characters themselves also stand out. For example, \u201clove master\u201d Shinchi Katori plays the role of an advisor and often gives advice related to love. Masafumi Akagi has a dominant personality and gets involved with Ryouko Kaji for his own personal reasons. Ayaka Kamine is the typical shy girl that can easily be found in most rom-coms. Her relationship with Gouda is one of the most normal ones you\u2019ll probably notice. Kana has the role of a tsundere as she often does things that can be easily misunderstood. Chizuru Takano is the stoic girl that\u2019s hard to notice. Saki Kanda, a member of the soft tennis club, is a normal girl with a relationship that began from a misunderstanding. The list goes on but the point is that all these characters has personalities that you\u2019d expect to encounter at school. In one way or another, the show will easily get viewers to care about them because of their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nNow I will admit, this show does lack a bit when it comes to storytelling. A lot of the same things happen in many episodes that can feel all over the place. Furthermore, the show feels very open when it comes to the character pairings and sometimes, it takes steps back with relationship development. Of course, this show isn\u2019t for anyone. It has emotional drama but most of it is lighthearted comedy rather than melodrama that you may see in shoujo anime. Despite that, it\u2019s engaging enough to keep the audience interested about the characters. It\u2019s charming, clever, and seeks the make memories that will give viewers something to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it doesn\u2019t have the most impressive visuals for an anime adaptation, the show is still able to capture the essence of its themes. It\u2019s simplistic enough to bring out character expressions and often times, it\u2019s contagiously entertaining to watch with characters\u2019 body language. It took me a little while to accept the art style of the show as at first, it felt lackluster. However, the more I watched, the more I realized how fitting the visuals are. It\u2019s faithful to the manga and make the most of what it is. \\n\\n\r\nTsurezure Children\u2019s soundtrack also plays an important role despite being overlooked. As a show with light comedy, it often is able to match the momentum of those special moments. On occasion, those moments feels like time itself stops and the OST brings out the feel of it. Theme songs is well choreographed with j-pop themes and catchy to hear. Character voices really carries the show together as it amplifies the personalities to make them credible. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime succeeds as an adaptation and is a terrific picture. It\u2019s appealing and filled with personality that can easily get viewers into the mood. It\u2019s hysterically humorous not by just its comedy aspects but by how every character pairing brings the most out from each other. While the storytelling occasionally holds the show back, it doesn\u2019t cause its destruction because plot isn\u2019t what this is anime is about. Rather, it takes these character relationships and makes it as whimsical as it can be. Looking for something to take mind off of and enjoy comfortably? Tsurezure Children is your answer and it doesn\u2019t even need to be a full length show to prove it.",

            "content": "Your usual highschool romance.\r\nExcept it's not.\r\nTsurezure children represents an interesting pattern that no anime did before, instead of havinga  main character, and the story around him/her, you have tons of pairs, and all of them are \"main characters\".\r\nSome of them get together early, some later, some don't at all, you have so many options to see, that's why it's unique.\r\nIf you like one pair, it sucks when you know you'll barely see them, as there are many more pairs, but if you dislike a pair, you know you won't be seeing them much.\r\nOverall I enjoyed Tsurezure children. I think the strongest point of itwas the interesting and huge cast of characters. Instead of the usual \"dense MC\", \"Tsundere\" and such tropes, you have more complex characters, each with his or her own tricks.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem is that it didnt have enough time to really cover up much, if I choose one pair and take all the time together, they barely have even one full length (24min) episode. And Tsurezure Children's episodes are only 12 minutes. While it was interesting seeing many pairs, at some point I felt like I want to just erase a few pairs so I can focus on the ones I love.\\n\\n\r\nSome pairs just stopped existing, and I wish I could've seen my favorite pairs instead of the pairs that stole screen time. Each minute is important.\\n\\n\r\nI RECOMMEND it, it's also half the time of a normal one cour series, so it shouldnt take much time to watch, 9/10",

            "content": "I'll keep this brief since this anime is not only a short but also rather straightforward in nature.\r\nTsurezure Children is a very simplistic anime on paper, but also a very satisfying and surprisingly original depiction of romance. For something with merely 12-minute episodes, it's hard to find many anime better than this with similar time span.\r\nTsurezure Children is almost like the antithesis of the stereotypical romance anime. Instead of having a boy and a girl clumsily dancing around each other throughout the whole anime only to get a kiss and/or a confession in the very last episode at best, in Tsurezure Children all the couplesare already established from the beginning in some way... and there are a lot of couples. So many I almost lost count of them.\\n\\n\r\nEssentially it is an anime depicting various types of young couples with very different personalities in order to see how they interact and flirt with each other. It's very cute but a lot of the time also quite funny to watch. But perhaps its biggest strength is that despite how many different couples there are and how little screen time each of them has individually as a whole, they all feel extremely believable. It is easy to understand the different characters' thought processes without them feeling forced or rushed, making it feel like a very realistic anime overall. As a result, the end goal of Tsurezure Children is not to \u201chook up with your crush somehow\u201d like it is in most romance anime, but rather just to portray different types of clumsy and innocent first-time relationships. It's surprising just how much of a rarity that is in anime really.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Tsurezure Children is a very enjoyable and genuinely refreshing romcom, and especially considering its short episode lengths it is most certainly worth spending the time on watching. And I also think the fact that a mere short managed to become one of the most popular anime of the season is by itself a testament to its success.",

            "content": "Romance is a universal theme in the lives of many people. It\u2019s something almost everyone must face at some point in their adolescence, whether they choose go through with it or not. How would you confess? How much do you love someone? How do you hide your crushes? What forms a successful romance? Are you shy or do you prefer to be flamboyant about it? In what ways, do you communicate with those you care about? Watch these questions and more be answered in Tsurezure Children, a playful set of comedic shorts all centered around one thing, the struggles of young love and budding relationships.\r\nEachepisode is only 12 minutes long, about half the length of your average anime episode, and in these shorts, there is usually 4 different stories about the hardships and struggles of young love. With 12 episodes, there are 48 different scenarios around one general subject. You might think this results in playing the same joke repeatedly but surprisingly, no. Almost every 3-minute story has its own subject matter relating to the general base to show that yes, love and early relationships are rarely handled the same way for anyone. These shorts can be about anything from awkward text misunderstandings, the aftermath of on-the-spot confessions, trying to help a friend talk to a girl, trying to say how much you like someone in a unique way, escaping the friend zone and many more. While not all of these shorts were comedy gold, and a few were kind of annoying, a majority them did get me to chuckle while watching, due to some of the character quirks and very unexpected outcome in a few more. The plots in general feel written for this format, to have a beginning, middle and end for every one and in doing that, the writing is really solid, even if the characters sometimes fail to distinguish as well as the plots. \\n\\n\r\nThe show features a decently handled cast of those in their adolescence, with about 5-6 character pairs and two main recurring ones in every vignette. For the most part, characterization is pretty basic, with many of the plots being defined by how much a character is feeling love anxiety for another, but there are a few exceptions. The inquisitive Akagi and the incredibly flamboyant Shinichi were standouts for their more eccentric nature going beyond the simple idea of love anxiety. Props to their voice actors for making their personalities come alive. Everyone else is generally fine. They seem to act like typical teenagers with the whole \u201canime reaction shot\u201d gimmicks, but are less memorable for their characters and moreso for the stories they are a part of, and towards how the animation conveys their feelings. At the same time, this is another credit to the short format of the series: that no one character overstays their welcome. If it ever gets close, you\u2019ll shift to another pair for the comedy to continue.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as presentation goes, it\u2019s generally pretty light. The animation by the have-yet-to-make a mark Studio Gokumi isn\u2019t standout, with very typical designs, colored hair, typical scene composition and face structure (with exception to Takao Yamane\u2019s frog face), as well as the school setting. At most, it\u2019s functional, but I won\u2019t go too hard on it given what it wants to convey is with writing and not visual spectacle, and that it does, along with the voice acting, help in playfully exaggerating the nervous and the flamboyant personalities. In terms of music, it\u2019s also generally typical. The OP is a basic pop tune that isn\u2019t too memorable or exciting, background music is generally fine, but I must give credit for the handling of the ED. It is fashioned like a typical climax moment song in most romantic dramas, but the usage makes it more special than that. Rather than it having separate visuals once the plot resolves, it plays as the last scene of the episode plays out. The expressively dramatic song both helps the romantic resolutions made in each episode\u2019s last short, and also serves to oxymoron if the scene is bombastic and silly. It\u2019s a nice touch that makes certain scenes funnier than they would be otherwise when sending off the episodes at the end.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nIn a season remembered less than fondly by horny psycho gambling nonsense, the most boring and derivative Fate entry yet, and the insipid lewdness of Hajimete no Gal, this was a bright bulb. Not the most original or creatively animated series, but for shorts, they were very charming and pleasant. I would recommend the series if you want a nice sweet time passer that reminds you what your teenage love life was like. Next time I\u2019ll be covering the season\u2019s biggest critical darling Made in Abyss. See you all then.\\n",

The first time I was about to kiss her, I remembered a dumb joke and burst out laughing, not just killing the mood, but mutilating the corpse too. The first time I told her I loved her, it took 30 minutes just to get the words out and only managed to when she said shehad to leave. Basically, I'm a loser, but you know what? I can laugh about it now, and I hope that I'm laughing with all the characters in this show when they fail just as hard as I did, and often even harder.\\n\\n\r\nTsurezure Children is about a bunch of high school kids going through their first relationships. Despite having a pretty large cast and a pretty short run time, it manages to flesh out each and every major character by giving them all this thing called personality. Each couple is in basically the same situation at the beginning of the series, and the show uses the differently personalities to drive each character in vastly different directions. By making the personalities the driving force of each story, and by using such blatant juxtaposition, the show makes you think of the characters as people, not just characters right off the bat. This is especially enforced by the framing of each story as just a snapshot into their lives rather than everything that's going on with them, we can even see them sometimes in the background of other people's snapshots. Because there's such a variety of personalities though, it manages to cover a pretty ridiculous amount of ground, from someone being in denial about their very first crush, to their first time trying to have sex. If you've ever been awkward before, you will relate to someone in this cast, probably several of them.",

It's another high school romance anime that we always anticapte of...'', but..\r\nThe uniqueness of how they made the story into seperate ones, simply, each character has a romantic story that most of us loved.\r\nHigh school itself in anime can be sometimes applied in real life or 'based' on. The way this anime puts the comedic side, along with the comedic and hilarious humor makes the anime a worth it to watch this Summer 2017 and I am so glad I'v watched this anime up to the ending...\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nI will not sayanything about the story because its basically obvious that when writing a story, an intro, rising, climax, falling and resolution is a MUST.\\n\r\nBut Tsurezure children offers us a 12-minute per episode show that shows various of plots in 1 episode. Kinda confusing but.. It's anime. I personally loved how they put the romance and humor in balance on every plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nI judge art not that much to be honest. If the art is pleasing enough for my eyes, it will be worth it until the end. The art on this anime is an extravagant one. The effects, the blush on the romance scenes, the short effects on joke scenes. All intimidating and gorgeous. Though I get the feeling, on my opinion that this art is only 9/10 due to the fact the feeling of lacking can be there sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nOpening is good.. Not that much my taste though what makes the sound 8/10 is that before the anime ends, the song plays already, making the sound more fitting to the side of romance.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nWe are introduced by so many characters on the spot! That is actually a huge problem, but when you watch like 2 or 3 more episodes, this problem fades away like a bird flies away at a distance. All because of the anime's great character development. We get to know their traits more and more, along their reaction to one another.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI'm not a fan of romance that much but when you consider a romantic anime that is enjoyable, its sides of humor can be considered also along with some plot twists and intense ones. Tsurezure offers us alot of them and its surprising that a 12-minute only anime can give so much that you can scream because of the romance, or laugh because of its cliched scenes and all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall... 8/10 will be my rating since the story is not that much, I can say that its purpose of the story really lived up to the heights of a normal human like me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

All romance fans should immediately watch. \r\nSince the show is adapted from a 4-koma manga, its storytelling structure is composed of mini-skits rather than a full, linear episode. There are multiple \"couples\" in the show, as the main picture shows, and every episode has about 4 of these mini-skits where it rotates through each couple. \r\nThe tone is extremely light-hearted, so don't expect much drama, but you'll get to see the struggles each couple faces. There are almost no drawn-out conflicts; most problems get resolved during or the episode after. \r\nThe romanceis endearingly innocent, and obviously highly idealized, but that's why we watch romance in the first place right. Overall just an extremely cute show to watch and give you some hope in love again. \\n\\n\r\n10/10 would recommend",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nLove makes the world a better place.\r\nSuch love can be for anyone or anything. A close family member. A good friend. A favorite pet. A passion in life. A meal on the table. Without love, we as people wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy each other and the things we have. So, it\u2019s worth it to appreciate such a wonderful feeling.\r\nOf course, we cannot forget about the most direct, unique love of them all: romance with a partner. That special someone in his or her life that nobody could ever replace in a million years. TsurezureChildren features such bonds basically a million times over, creating an anime that makes it easy for the audience to love back in turn.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nTsuzure Children sets itself up with the short format for its content. Its episodes run for just about thirteen minutes total, so it doesn\u2019t have too much time to work with. However, it really only has one concept on its mind: love.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, this anime loves love. Thus, like an unending buffet of Valentine\u2019s Day cupcakes, the anime fills the audience with romantic goodness in bite-size chunks that neither overstuff nor overbear. The sweet frosting promises cuteness as the characters react with full blushes and jubilation. The fluffy cake houses their lovey-dovey exchanges, ranging anywhere from playful teasing to passionate kissing. And the decorative wrapper that holds the dessert together carries comedy as \u201cThe Love Master\u201d shares his knowledge, as a little sister attempts to stop potential progress, and as the occasional joke fills the space between those love-centric moments.\\n\\n\r\nThese vignettes are scrumptious. But, when the local bakery displays them all at once in its front window, the larger picture surfaces: Tsurezure Children highlights how romance comes in many different shapes and sizes. One couple is just starting the whole dating scene. One couple experiences hardship that tests their relationship. One couple seems completely unlikely (from the guy\u2019s own point of view at any rate). In other words, those cupcakes are made up of the same common ingredients, yet their final taste tastes unlike each other.\\n\\n\r\nSimultaneously, the cupcakes look different as well \u2013 and that\u2019s the same for the couples. Their behaviors and feelings differ among them, creating dynamics that permit new ways for the anime to showcase what love does and means. Some joke around to avoid that initial awkwardness. Some miscommunicate their meaningful intentions. Some contemplate seriously what such a relationship entails. So, much like romance, the love that blossoms within such a concept also varies in shape and size.\\n\\n\r\nWith such constant variety, Tsurezure Children remains rather entertaining as it flits back and forth between every cupcake. While certain pairings do receive more screen time than others, and the audience will most likely have their own favorites, it isn\u2019t too much of a stretch to deem this show as having \u201csomething for everybody.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, this \u201csomething\u201d does not just stay put with the status quo. Quite often, their small plotlines involve tangible progress for their romance and their love, turning a bunch of comedy asides into worthwhile moments for the multiple characters involved.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, these well-made, tasty, and varied cupcakes earn a three-star Michelin rating.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nJust as Tsurezure Children showcases tons of variety in the romance and love between the couples, it also does the same with the many designs of its characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe colors and shading for their looks come from a bunch of areas on the rainbow that not only give them vibrant looks but also make it easier to tell them apart from one another. Plus, different depictions for their eyes, clothes, hair, and builds give them even more uniqueness amongst one another.\\n\\n\r\nThese character designs clearly take precedence within the show. After all, with the numerous couples and the focus on interactions, their depictions become the most important part for the visuals (and subsequently the romance).\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, the anime incorporates other stylistic choices that drive its content. Lots of cute and funny reactions for the characters. Imaginative scenarios. A semi-infrequent all-black background. In short, the anime does what it can to spice up its presentation.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, the visuals coast along without doing too much. Movement remains at least serviceable. Background artistry does not stand out. The occasional hiccup in character proportions is noticeable but not egregious. And the cinematography is at least there in some form.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, the designs matter most, so these middling aspects of the art and the animation do not impact the show a whole lot. However, they do keep it from reaching that highest level when it comes to a critical sense.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nTo sell those story cupcakes from earlier, people are needed to man the cash register and guide people throughout the store. For Tsurezure Children, those people are its characters, and they do a very good job.\\n\\n\r\nAt roughly seven main couples, the anime does have its hands full. However, it manages to juggle them well if only because they each have their own personalities. That sounds like a no-brainer when it comes to writing believable characters, but, when fourteen (and then some) different ones exist at the same time here, and the show itself only has so much time in which to involve them, their ability to feel like their own person is not so easy to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Tsurezure Children achieves such an outcome, crafting characters that have personal quirks, actions, and motivations that give them a foothold of their own to stand on throughout the season. For example, Jun is a very serious person who does not rush into a situation (let alone a relationship) without careful thought. Chizuru is quiet and kind but a bit too na\u00efve when it comes to love. Yamane is ugly (according to himself), and he greatly appreciates his friendship with his buddy Motoyama. Ayaka is actually a lot needier than at first believed.\\n\\n\r\nMore importantly, though, these characters grow from the romance and the love that the share between each other. Take Kyouko. Akagi influences her enough to become a better person all around. She stops smoking. She values herself more. She pursues her studies in earnest. Chiaki is another strong example. He puts aside his silliness to declare what he cares about most: Kana and their relationship. Simply put, he comes to understand that she means more to him than any kiss ever could.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters and their dynamics keep those cupcakes flying off the shelves, Tsurezure Children unfortunately loses a few employees along the way. Kanda and Takase do not see a proper resolution to the awkward confession and tension built between them. Also, the show seemingly forgets about the set of characters from or related to the astronomy club for no real reason.\\n\\n\r\nDespite these tiny mishaps, the cast still differentiate themselves throughout the season, and their romances allow them to grow in tangible ways. A set of positives that make their efforts in the bakery worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nMuch like the artistry, Tsurezure Children puts the most care for its audio into the characters with very solid voice acting for each of them. While nearly every role strikes at cuteness or fun, without a doubt the best performance comes out of Haruka Tomatsu as Hotaru.\\n\\n\r\nShe only has a couple of scenes, but her introductory one turns into something arguably memorable. Different pitches, emotions, and noises in the span of almost three minutes demonstrate her skill and boost the execution of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the VA performances, the music rests comfortably in the passable category. The opening track \u201cAimai Moko\u201d is a nice little song whose acoustic guitar, chimes, eventual violins, and cheerful tone follow the anime\u2019s own lighthearted feel.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the ending track \u201cDear\u201d leads the audience out of each episode with a gentle pull as a slow vocal delivery and soft piano keys ring out in the background. And the rest of the original soundtrack goes for daintier instrumentation for both its comedic and dramatic segments, giving the show\u2019s scenes a stronger foundation to stand upon.\\n\\n\r\nIn total, the OP, the ED, and the OST are collectively one of the weaker parts of the show, but the VA performances rise above its average brethren. Ensuring that the audio quality of Tsurezure Children does not fall into anywhere unfavorable.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nRomance is my jam, and this anime was jam packed with romance. So, naturally, I quite liked it.\\n\\n\r\nEach couple brought something new to the table that got me smiling on my face and giddy in my soul. Ryouko and Akagi had a lot of maturity as they bullied and quarreled with each other. Kana and Chiaki synchronized their antics and worked hard to push their relationship forward. Ayaka and Takeru shared their thoughts and wants openly to deepen their connection.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s not even half of them. Kanda and Takase overjoyed while texting. Chizuru trying to come to terms with her feelings for Sugawara as he tried to make his for her known. Motoyama supporting Chiyo and Yamane like a true bro. And Yuki teasing Jun constantly as Hotaru tried to interfere. Essentially, I was rooting for every couple\u2019s success, and I was laughing with happiness while doing so.\\n\\n\r\nI also really appreciated the kindhearted atmosphere. Yes, tiny conflicts popped up on a rare basis, but the content made sure to take on a positive spin as much as it could. I didn\u2019t have to worry about anything mean going down, and it was obvious that, if any problems did arise, they would inevitably correct themselves in the best way possible. This atmosphere, combined with the fun couples and their awesome romances, made this show a super-fun experience.\\n\\n\r\nTsurezure Children is a short anime with a lot to offer. The focus on love for its story and its characters create many a heartfelt, comedic moment for the audience to like. And the audiovisual design, while not too impressive, has its spare shining qualities as well. This concluding description is just one of the million ways in which to give this project praise.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, an unending buffet of yummy Valentine\u2019s Day cupcakes\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Good, the different, colorful character designs take precedence over the interesting stylistic choices and other passable aspects of the visual presentation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, the members of this very large cast have distinct representations even with the short runtime, and their romances allow them to grow for the better, but focus on specific ones is lost along the way\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Fine, some nice VA performances carry the audio forward as the OP, the ED, and the OST watch from the sidelines\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, jam packed with romantic goodness\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

Although for me it was the case that I liked almost all of them, but BECAUSE the cast is so large I was bound to find ones I did not like.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are someone who likes quick development in a relationship, there's a couple for you.\\n\\n\r\nIf you prefer a long, drawn out development with lots of slip ups and painful misunderstandings, there's a couple for you.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like the loli-esque shy girl who underestimates how kawaii she is but slowly gains the confidence to address the feelings she has about a boy in her class, there's a couple for you.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like the loudmouth tsundere who really just wants to tell the boy she cares about how she feels but can't bring herself to do it in a way that isn't off-putting, there's a couple for you.\\n\\n\r\nIf, for some reason you like the nerdy kid who refuses to believe any girl will ever love him and freaks THE FUCK OUT whenever he talks to anyone of the opposite gender, unfortunately there's a couple for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe point is, the major variety seen in Tsurezure children is what makes it so damn great. There's something for everyone to enjoy. But it doesn't get a 10 from me because there is also something for everyone to hate.\\n\\n",

I ended up forgetting about it and just now finished it. \r\nBut this was a fun show that has some pretty awesome moments in it. Such as one of the characters sister being messed around with by the girlfriend.\r\nWhile i do enjoy this and it's fun . The issue i have with it is two things.\r\n1. The story doesn't have an actual ending for a lot of the characters. Such as the Student Council President and the Delinquent and more. \r\n2. While it isn't really bad. It can be annoying how its not just onestory in a row. We get one story chopped up into pieces over multiple episodes. This can be alright but for me i just wish we could watch all of one duo's story with it not being over the span of 12 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also has in my opinion two of the greatest couples in anime of 2017\\n\r\nAkagixRyouko and TakanoxTakurou \\n\\n\r\nI really love these two groups. I would honestly love to see AkagixRyouko have their own story. They are really good on screen and funny. The other Duo is also pretty good. I don't know if they could do their own story by them self.\\n\\n\r\nReally good story and is fun to just watch.",

I didn't think I'd like it when I first heard of it, but after the first episode I was hooked.\r\nTsurezure Children is about different couples at the same school. There are aorund 9 couples and every episode is only 12 minutes long, so they show 3 or 4 couples each episode.\r\nThat kind of bugged me, tbh. Some couples got a lot (and I mean A LOT) of screen time, while other couples only appear once or twice throughout the entire series. Because of that, I couldn't really get into some of the relationships.\r\nHowever, I reallyliked how none of the couples (or characters for that matter) were the same. Yet all of them were shipable. That made up for the screen time-thingy.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is really enjoyable and I ended up falling in love with it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"12 minutes per ep and focusing on 4 different couples every ep? How in the world would that work?\" That was my first thought before I started the show, and here we are 12 episodes later and I've become a self-inflicted diabetic BECAUSE OH MY GOD THIS SHOW IS TOO FLUFFY. (But with a tinge of angst too ;)) \r\nYou'd think with so many characters and relationships and stories to tell with such limited time, how would they accomplish it? Won't it get all choppy and messy? Won't you feel detached from the characters? Well for me at least, I gladly answer no to theprevious two questions. Tsurezure Children does a spectacular job of being a romance anime, and it does the audience a favour by shaving off all the unnecessary roundabouts and extra boring tidbits and surges straight to the good juicy moments of romance and fluff that we all came for. I guarantee anyone in the single squad will think \"man, I want to fall in love\" at least a couple times throughout indulging this show, it is that powerful. \\n\\n\r\nWhat one might see as the show's possible biggest downfall of too many relationships, was crafted out to be the show's greatest strength, and that is the explorations of how silly adolescent relationships functions, their different dynamics and how people with different personalities are matched together and henceforth their cute interactions with each other. It really is a breath of fresh air and makes you want to root for them. There is no drama, no tragedy, none of that sad shit, just tons and tons of sugar and everything sweet. That's not to say its one-dimensional, because the show isn't short of heartwarming scenes that reached out to me emotionally. \\n\\n\r\nBut my intention here isn't to put in on a pedestal and market it as some masterpiece, because it really isn't, hence my rating of only 8/10. One of the issues I have with it (that really isn't its fault in the first place per se) but WHY IS IT ONLY 12 MINUTES LONG AND ONLY 12 EPISODES IN THIS SEASON??? So for fear of it only being a season long without a sequel, and given its current far from completion state, I can only give it such a score. \\n\\n\r\nBut nonetheless, I enjoyed myself very much and got a better glimpse of having a high school romance, something that I don't have and probably won't have xD",

            "content": "High school romances are often the most delicate things.\u00a0 The fragility of youth is complimented by equally fragile yet pure relationships that're formed when two people discover feel their pulse quicken when being near the people they want to spend time with.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nStory: Tsurezure Children follows a rotating cast of characters where each of its twelve minute long episode is split into three parts, each part focusing on a different couple or in some cases, successive parts that focus on the same pair.\u00a0 With it, the show gives off a sense of progress as each couple grows closer to each other and gives the viewer avariety of stories varying from those that lead up to the typical confession scene in most romance shows, or show us the rockiness or steadiness of different relationships given the two parties involved.\u00a0 As a result, the show is quite varied and despite the flipflop, feels like it has more to it due to the progressive feeling of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe one downside for the story however is how a good number of the couples really don't get that much screentime.\u00a0 More than half of all of the featured couples in this show are barely given any attention, so it becomes awkward to watch when you're following one couple and their story for the past two weeks, but all of a sudden, these people who haven't gotten any mention since episode two show up and suddenly get a bit to themselves.\u00a0 The imbalance is quite clear towards the end of the series, and it's a bit of a disappointment cause some of my more favorite couples are those that didn't get much attention at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Varied show with a sense of progress\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Heavy imbalance with the presentation of some couples\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Honestly there is no way you're gonna remember the characters.\u00a0 At least a majority of them.\u00a0 More than anything, the show sets them up in such a way that should you forget their names, the interactions with their partner are recognizable enough for you to remember which couple is being featured at a given time, something that was quite common for me because the later episodes pretty much focused on only two to three of the total eight or so couples in this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe imbalance with the stories becomes painfully clear when Gouda and Kamine or Kana and Chiaki become the only centerpieces the show is willing to focus on.\u00a0 (Maybe Sugawara and Takano too.)\u00a0 I remember those names specifically because the show liked to focus on their story so much that they completely disregarded the astronomy girl or even the couple who had the first scene in the whole series without batting an eye.\u00a0 Indeed while some of the lesser stories got enough attention to fulfill some kind of small saga, and others are larger in detail and require more time for an overarching story, I can't help but shake the feeling that things could've turned out better with better screentime balance.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Large cast of still recognizable characters\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Imbalance becomes painfully clear later on in the series (I only remember about half of the couples' names by heart.)\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by Studio Gokumi, Tsurezure Children bears a simple style with bold and easy colors complimented by the cartoonish nature of the character designs.\u00a0 While the art quality itself isn't that amazing, it's the character designs that's the art's selling point.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character is defined in both hair color and hair design.\u00a0 Personally I think this is a really good way of distinguishing a large cast because during the switch to a different story, the couples's hair color ends up becoming the main indicator for the audience as to who we're focusing on since pretty much everyone has a different style or color to their hair, making us think \"Oh, this couple\" rather than struggling to remember their names and what quirk they have.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Simple yet bold artstyle\\n\r\n+ Different hair colors makes couple distinguishing easy (Probably overthinking it, but it's my theory.)\\n\\n\r\nSound: Performed by Inori Minase, the show's OP \"Aimai Moko\" is a cheerful and happy song that despite sounding good, isn't really all that memorable if I may be honest.\u00a0 There's nothing about it that screams memorable and honestly wasn't a song that appeared in my radar.\u00a0 The rest of the soundtrack I feel is the same way so there's really nothing special to note here.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Despite the imbalance, Tsurezure Children was a fun watch.\u00a0 It had all of the elements of a bunch of different romance anime without cluttering itself because the show always focused on only one story at a time.\u00a0 I admit I was mildly annoyed by how the show only just told the story of two of the existing couples.\u00a0 Especially because there were so many others who were just as deserving of that screentime but didn't get the time of day to really show a lot of progress.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\r\nMore specifically, I like Hanakana's character, Minagawa.\u00a0 Her and Furuya were my favorite couple out of the lot and I'm so sad that they didn't get more screentime.\u00a0 It was fucking gold and I wanted more.\u00a0 Why didn't you give us more?!\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\r\nHonestly, Gouda and Kamine's relationship is...boring.\u00a0 Or at least the show made it boring.\u00a0 Every time they came on, it was the exact same thing with not much progression to move things along.\u00a0 Puppy love is cute and all, but if you're not gonna do much with it, you might as well give the screentime to a couple who needs it.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\r\nIf you want something cute, Tsurezure Children is a really good fit.\u00a0 It fits along a broad spectrum of different romance stories and packs them all in a neat little series that works surprisingly well despite having eight or so different stories happening at once.\u00a0 Indeed the imbalance is annoying and your favorite couple might not get the time of day, but the show is still fun and enjoyable to watch, so I would recommend it.",

            "content": "\u201cI love you\u201d is perhaps one of the most complex combination of words in the human language. It holds a special meaning for people of any age and for teenagers, that\u2019s no overstatement. Tsurezure Children takes the idea of romance and brings it out like skits of human stories. It\u2019s a definitely a series that I found charming and doesn\u2019t even to be full length to show that.\r\nAs a fan of the manga, I originally had mixed expectations for this adaptation. The manga has over 140 chapters and ongoing. Each chapter is only a few pages long and it would feel like the show mayhave some difficultly to transform this into anime form. However, the first few episodes easily convinced me that this anime has what it takes to set the bar for a rom-com. At its core, Tsurezure Children is about relationships of young people. There is quite a diverse range of characters and some of the couples really stand out compared to others. What really made me appreciate the show is how smooth the story flowed with the characters. Despite just being half length, it doesn\u2019t waste time to showcase character pairings. It mixes character drama, humor, realism, and romance altogether. \\n\\n\r\nThe show has a very colorful cast with all sort of characters. It has childhood friends, a tsundere, a delinquent, dominant guys, class representatives, stoic girl, drama club leaders, club members, etc. It\u2019s like bringing together all the gimmicks you remember from high school days and stick them together. Of course, this invites all sorts of personalities into the show as well. What I find highly entertaining about the couple pairings is that all of them can be relatable. Think of your days when you were in school and the times when you had a crush on someone. If you look at the show from the characters\u2019 perspective, it can feel like you\u2019re there with them. And to be honest, I think that\u2019s what makes this series really fun to watch. Romance is a very complex theme that has no real answer. Love is a very powerful emotion and this show explores that in many ways. Expect to hear confessions often and this show is not afraid to pull the trigger often between pairings.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the drama, the show is actually very lighthearted and comedy plays a big role to entertain the viewers. It\u2019s very gimmicky with characters showing attraction towards each other in their pairings. Rather than forcing humor down viewers\u2019 throats, it comes out very naturally. Individually, the characters themselves also stand out. For example, \u201clove master\u201d Shinchi Katori plays the role of an advisor and often gives advice related to love. Masafumi Akagi has a dominant personality and gets involved with Ryouko Kaji for his own personal reasons. Ayaka Kamine is the typical shy girl that can easily be found in most rom-coms. Her relationship with Gouda is one of the most normal ones you\u2019ll probably notice. Kana has the role of a tsundere as she often does things that can be easily misunderstood. Chizuru Takano is the stoic girl that\u2019s hard to notice. Saki Kanda, a member of the soft tennis club, is a normal girl with a relationship that began from a misunderstanding. The list goes on but the point is that all these characters has personalities that you\u2019d expect to encounter at school. In one way or another, the show will easily get viewers to care about them because of their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nNow I will admit, this show does lack a bit when it comes to storytelling. A lot of the same things happen in many episodes that can feel all over the place. Furthermore, the show feels very open when it comes to the character pairings and sometimes, it takes steps back with relationship development. Of course, this show isn\u2019t for anyone. It has emotional drama but most of it is lighthearted comedy rather than melodrama that you may see in shoujo anime. Despite that, it\u2019s engaging enough to keep the audience interested about the characters. It\u2019s charming, clever, and seeks the make memories that will give viewers something to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it doesn\u2019t have the most impressive visuals for an anime adaptation, the show is still able to capture the essence of its themes. It\u2019s simplistic enough to bring out character expressions and often times, it\u2019s contagiously entertaining to watch with characters\u2019 body language. It took me a little while to accept the art style of the show as at first, it felt lackluster. However, the more I watched, the more I realized how fitting the visuals are. It\u2019s faithful to the manga and make the most of what it is. \\n\\n\r\nTsurezure Children\u2019s soundtrack also plays an important role despite being overlooked. As a show with light comedy, it often is able to match the momentum of those special moments. On occasion, those moments feels like time itself stops and the OST brings out the feel of it. Theme songs is well choreographed with j-pop themes and catchy to hear. Character voices really carries the show together as it amplifies the personalities to make them credible. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime succeeds as an adaptation and is a terrific picture. It\u2019s appealing and filled with personality that can easily get viewers into the mood. It\u2019s hysterically humorous not by just its comedy aspects but by how every character pairing brings the most out from each other. While the storytelling occasionally holds the show back, it doesn\u2019t cause its destruction because plot isn\u2019t what this is anime is about. Rather, it takes these character relationships and makes it as whimsical as it can be. Looking for something to take mind off of and enjoy comfortably? Tsurezure Children is your answer and it doesn\u2019t even need to be a full length show to prove it.",

            "content": "Your usual highschool romance.\r\nExcept it's not.\r\nTsurezure children represents an interesting pattern that no anime did before, instead of havinga  main character, and the story around him/her, you have tons of pairs, and all of them are \"main characters\".\r\nSome of them get together early, some later, some don't at all, you have so many options to see, that's why it's unique.\r\nIf you like one pair, it sucks when you know you'll barely see them, as there are many more pairs, but if you dislike a pair, you know you won't be seeing them much.\r\nOverall I enjoyed Tsurezure children. I think the strongest point of itwas the interesting and huge cast of characters. Instead of the usual \"dense MC\", \"Tsundere\" and such tropes, you have more complex characters, each with his or her own tricks.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem is that it didnt have enough time to really cover up much, if I choose one pair and take all the time together, they barely have even one full length (24min) episode. And Tsurezure Children's episodes are only 12 minutes. While it was interesting seeing many pairs, at some point I felt like I want to just erase a few pairs so I can focus on the ones I love.\\n\\n\r\nSome pairs just stopped existing, and I wish I could've seen my favorite pairs instead of the pairs that stole screen time. Each minute is important.\\n\\n\r\nI RECOMMEND it, it's also half the time of a normal one cour series, so it shouldnt take much time to watch, 9/10",

            "content": "I'll keep this brief since this anime is not only a short but also rather straightforward in nature.\r\nTsurezure Children is a very simplistic anime on paper, but also a very satisfying and surprisingly original depiction of romance. For something with merely 12-minute episodes, it's hard to find many anime better than this with similar time span.\r\nTsurezure Children is almost like the antithesis of the stereotypical romance anime. Instead of having a boy and a girl clumsily dancing around each other throughout the whole anime only to get a kiss and/or a confession in the very last episode at best, in Tsurezure Children all the couplesare already established from the beginning in some way... and there are a lot of couples. So many I almost lost count of them.\\n\\n\r\nEssentially it is an anime depicting various types of young couples with very different personalities in order to see how they interact and flirt with each other. It's very cute but a lot of the time also quite funny to watch. But perhaps its biggest strength is that despite how many different couples there are and how little screen time each of them has individually as a whole, they all feel extremely believable. It is easy to understand the different characters' thought processes without them feeling forced or rushed, making it feel like a very realistic anime overall. As a result, the end goal of Tsurezure Children is not to \u201chook up with your crush somehow\u201d like it is in most romance anime, but rather just to portray different types of clumsy and innocent first-time relationships. It's surprising just how much of a rarity that is in anime really.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Tsurezure Children is a very enjoyable and genuinely refreshing romcom, and especially considering its short episode lengths it is most certainly worth spending the time on watching. And I also think the fact that a mere short managed to become one of the most popular anime of the season is by itself a testament to its success.",

            "content": "Romance is a universal theme in the lives of many people. It\u2019s something almost everyone must face at some point in their adolescence, whether they choose go through with it or not. How would you confess? How much do you love someone? How do you hide your crushes? What forms a successful romance? Are you shy or do you prefer to be flamboyant about it? In what ways, do you communicate with those you care about? Watch these questions and more be answered in Tsurezure Children, a playful set of comedic shorts all centered around one thing, the struggles of young love and budding relationships.\r\nEachepisode is only 12 minutes long, about half the length of your average anime episode, and in these shorts, there is usually 4 different stories about the hardships and struggles of young love. With 12 episodes, there are 48 different scenarios around one general subject. You might think this results in playing the same joke repeatedly but surprisingly, no. Almost every 3-minute story has its own subject matter relating to the general base to show that yes, love and early relationships are rarely handled the same way for anyone. These shorts can be about anything from awkward text misunderstandings, the aftermath of on-the-spot confessions, trying to help a friend talk to a girl, trying to say how much you like someone in a unique way, escaping the friend zone and many more. While not all of these shorts were comedy gold, and a few were kind of annoying, a majority them did get me to chuckle while watching, due to some of the character quirks and very unexpected outcome in a few more. The plots in general feel written for this format, to have a beginning, middle and end for every one and in doing that, the writing is really solid, even if the characters sometimes fail to distinguish as well as the plots. \\n\\n\r\nThe show features a decently handled cast of those in their adolescence, with about 5-6 character pairs and two main recurring ones in every vignette. For the most part, characterization is pretty basic, with many of the plots being defined by how much a character is feeling love anxiety for another, but there are a few exceptions. The inquisitive Akagi and the incredibly flamboyant Shinichi were standouts for their more eccentric nature going beyond the simple idea of love anxiety. Props to their voice actors for making their personalities come alive. Everyone else is generally fine. They seem to act like typical teenagers with the whole \u201canime reaction shot\u201d gimmicks, but are less memorable for their characters and moreso for the stories they are a part of, and towards how the animation conveys their feelings. At the same time, this is another credit to the short format of the series: that no one character overstays their welcome. If it ever gets close, you\u2019ll shift to another pair for the comedy to continue.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as presentation goes, it\u2019s generally pretty light. The animation by the have-yet-to-make a mark Studio Gokumi isn\u2019t standout, with very typical designs, colored hair, typical scene composition and face structure (with exception to Takao Yamane\u2019s frog face), as well as the school setting. At most, it\u2019s functional, but I won\u2019t go too hard on it given what it wants to convey is with writing and not visual spectacle, and that it does, along with the voice acting, help in playfully exaggerating the nervous and the flamboyant personalities. In terms of music, it\u2019s also generally typical. The OP is a basic pop tune that isn\u2019t too memorable or exciting, background music is generally fine, but I must give credit for the handling of the ED. It is fashioned like a typical climax moment song in most romantic dramas, but the usage makes it more special than that. Rather than it having separate visuals once the plot resolves, it plays as the last scene of the episode plays out. The expressively dramatic song both helps the romantic resolutions made in each episode\u2019s last short, and also serves to oxymoron if the scene is bombastic and silly. It\u2019s a nice touch that makes certain scenes funnier than they would be otherwise when sending off the episodes at the end.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nIn a season remembered less than fondly by horny psycho gambling nonsense, the most boring and derivative Fate entry yet, and the insipid lewdness of Hajimete no Gal, this was a bright bulb. Not the most original or creatively animated series, but for shorts, they were very charming and pleasant. I would recommend the series if you want a nice sweet time passer that reminds you what your teenage love life was like. Next time I\u2019ll be covering the season\u2019s biggest critical darling Made in Abyss. See you all then.\\n",

            "content": "\"Painfully relatable,\" that is the only way I can think of to describe this show.\r\nThe first time I told a girl I liked her, I stalled for an entire year despite literally everyone, including her, knowing the entire time, and finally could only finally do it via a stupid text. The first time I was about to kiss her, I remembered a dumb joke and burst out laughing, not just killing the mood, but mutilating the corpse too. The first time I told her I loved her, it took 30 minutes just to get the words out and only managed to when she said shehad to leave. Basically, I'm a loser, but you know what? I can laugh about it now, and I hope that I'm laughing with all the characters in this show when they fail just as hard as I did, and often even harder.\\n\\n\r\nTsurezure Children is about a bunch of high school kids going through their first relationships. Despite having a pretty large cast and a pretty short run time, it manages to flesh out each and every major character by giving them all this thing called personality. Each couple is in basically the same situation at the beginning of the series, and the show uses the differently personalities to drive each character in vastly different directions. By making the personalities the driving force of each story, and by using such blatant juxtaposition, the show makes you think of the characters as people, not just characters right off the bat. This is especially enforced by the framing of each story as just a snapshot into their lives rather than everything that's going on with them, we can even see them sometimes in the background of other people's snapshots. Because there's such a variety of personalities though, it manages to cover a pretty ridiculous amount of ground, from someone being in denial about their very first crush, to their first time trying to have sex. If you've ever been awkward before, you will relate to someone in this cast, probably several of them.",

            "content": "At first, when I take a look at the anime, I was like ''Ohh.. It's another high school romance anime that we always anticapte of...'', but..\r\nThe uniqueness of how they made the story into seperate ones, simply, each character has a romantic story that most of us loved.\r\nHigh school itself in anime can be sometimes applied in real life or 'based' on. The way this anime puts the comedic side, along with the comedic and hilarious humor makes the anime a worth it to watch this Summer 2017 and I am so glad I'v watched this anime up to the ending...\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nI will not sayanything about the story because its basically obvious that when writing a story, an intro, rising, climax, falling and resolution is a MUST.\\n\r\nBut Tsurezure children offers us a 12-minute per episode show that shows various of plots in 1 episode. Kinda confusing but.. It's anime. I personally loved how they put the romance and humor in balance on every plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nI judge art not that much to be honest. If the art is pleasing enough for my eyes, it will be worth it until the end. The art on this anime is an extravagant one. The effects, the blush on the romance scenes, the short effects on joke scenes. All intimidating and gorgeous. Though I get the feeling, on my opinion that this art is only 9/10 due to the fact the feeling of lacking can be there sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nOpening is good.. Not that much my taste though what makes the sound 8/10 is that before the anime ends, the song plays already, making the sound more fitting to the side of romance.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nWe are introduced by so many characters on the spot! That is actually a huge problem, but when you watch like 2 or 3 more episodes, this problem fades away like a bird flies away at a distance. All because of the anime's great character development. We get to know their traits more and more, along their reaction to one another.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI'm not a fan of romance that much but when you consider a romantic anime that is enjoyable, its sides of humor can be considered also along with some plot twists and intense ones. Tsurezure offers us alot of them and its surprising that a 12-minute only anime can give so much that you can scream because of the romance, or laugh because of its cliched scenes and all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall... 8/10 will be my rating since the story is not that much, I can say that its purpose of the story really lived up to the heights of a normal human like me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

All romance fans should immediately watch. \r\nSince the show is adapted from a 4-koma manga, its storytelling structure is composed of mini-skits rather than a full, linear episode. There are multiple \"couples\" in the show, as the main picture shows, and every episode has about 4 of these mini-skits where it rotates through each couple. \r\nThe tone is extremely light-hearted, so don't expect much drama, but you'll get to see the struggles each couple faces. There are almost no drawn-out conflicts; most problems get resolved during or the episode after. \r\nThe romanceis endearingly innocent, and obviously highly idealized, but that's why we watch romance in the first place right. Overall just an extremely cute show to watch and give you some hope in love again. \\n\\n\r\n10/10 would recommend",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nLove makes the world a better place.\r\nSuch love can be for anyone or anything. A close family member. A good friend. A favorite pet. A passion in life. A meal on the table. Without love, we as people wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy each other and the things we have. So, it\u2019s worth it to appreciate such a wonderful feeling.\r\nOf course, we cannot forget about the most direct, unique love of them all: romance with a partner. That special someone in his or her life that nobody could ever replace in a million years. TsurezureChildren features such bonds basically a million times over, creating an anime that makes it easy for the audience to love back in turn.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nTsuzure Children sets itself up with the short format for its content. Its episodes run for just about thirteen minutes total, so it doesn\u2019t have too much time to work with. However, it really only has one concept on its mind: love.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, this anime loves love. Thus, like an unending buffet of Valentine\u2019s Day cupcakes, the anime fills the audience with romantic goodness in bite-size chunks that neither overstuff nor overbear. The sweet frosting promises cuteness as the characters react with full blushes and jubilation. The fluffy cake houses their lovey-dovey exchanges, ranging anywhere from playful teasing to passionate kissing. And the decorative wrapper that holds the dessert together carries comedy as \u201cThe Love Master\u201d shares his knowledge, as a little sister attempts to stop potential progress, and as the occasional joke fills the space between those love-centric moments.\\n\\n\r\nThese vignettes are scrumptious. But, when the local bakery displays them all at once in its front window, the larger picture surfaces: Tsurezure Children highlights how romance comes in many different shapes and sizes. One couple is just starting the whole dating scene. One couple experiences hardship that tests their relationship. One couple seems completely unlikely (from the guy\u2019s own point of view at any rate). In other words, those cupcakes are made up of the same common ingredients, yet their final taste tastes unlike each other.\\n\\n\r\nSimultaneously, the cupcakes look different as well \u2013 and that\u2019s the same for the couples. Their behaviors and feelings differ among them, creating dynamics that permit new ways for the anime to showcase what love does and means. Some joke around to avoid that initial awkwardness. Some miscommunicate their meaningful intentions. Some contemplate seriously what such a relationship entails. So, much like romance, the love that blossoms within such a concept also varies in shape and size.\\n\\n\r\nWith such constant variety, Tsurezure Children remains rather entertaining as it flits back and forth between every cupcake. While certain pairings do receive more screen time than others, and the audience will most likely have their own favorites, it isn\u2019t too much of a stretch to deem this show as having \u201csomething for everybody.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, this \u201csomething\u201d does not just stay put with the status quo. Quite often, their small plotlines involve tangible progress for their romance and their love, turning a bunch of comedy asides into worthwhile moments for the multiple characters involved.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, these well-made, tasty, and varied cupcakes earn a three-star Michelin rating.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nJust as Tsurezure Children showcases tons of variety in the romance and love between the couples, it also does the same with the many designs of its characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe colors and shading for their looks come from a bunch of areas on the rainbow that not only give them vibrant looks but also make it easier to tell them apart from one another. Plus, different depictions for their eyes, clothes, hair, and builds give them even more uniqueness amongst one another.\\n\\n\r\nThese character designs clearly take precedence within the show. After all, with the numerous couples and the focus on interactions, their depictions become the most important part for the visuals (and subsequently the romance).\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, the anime incorporates other stylistic choices that drive its content. Lots of cute and funny reactions for the characters. Imaginative scenarios. A semi-infrequent all-black background. In short, the anime does what it can to spice up its presentation.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, the visuals coast along without doing too much. Movement remains at least serviceable. Background artistry does not stand out. The occasional hiccup in character proportions is noticeable but not egregious. And the cinematography is at least there in some form.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, the designs matter most, so these middling aspects of the art and the animation do not impact the show a whole lot. However, they do keep it from reaching that highest level when it comes to a critical sense.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nTo sell those story cupcakes from earlier, people are needed to man the cash register and guide people throughout the store. For Tsurezure Children, those people are its characters, and they do a very good job.\\n\\n\r\nAt roughly seven main couples, the anime does have its hands full. However, it manages to juggle them well if only because they each have their own personalities. That sounds like a no-brainer when it comes to writing believable characters, but, when fourteen (and then some) different ones exist at the same time here, and the show itself only has so much time in which to involve them, their ability to feel like their own person is not so easy to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Tsurezure Children achieves such an outcome, crafting characters that have personal quirks, actions, and motivations that give them a foothold of their own to stand on throughout the season. For example, Jun is a very serious person who does not rush into a situation (let alone a relationship) without careful thought. Chizuru is quiet and kind but a bit too na\u00efve when it comes to love. Yamane is ugly (according to himself), and he greatly appreciates his friendship with his buddy Motoyama. Ayaka is actually a lot needier than at first believed.\\n\\n\r\nMore importantly, though, these characters grow from the romance and the love that the share between each other. Take Kyouko. Akagi influences her enough to become a better person all around. She stops smoking. She values herself more. She pursues her studies in earnest. Chiaki is another strong example. He puts aside his silliness to declare what he cares about most: Kana and their relationship. Simply put, he comes to understand that she means more to him than any kiss ever could.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters and their dynamics keep those cupcakes flying off the shelves, Tsurezure Children unfortunately loses a few employees along the way. Kanda and Takase do not see a proper resolution to the awkward confession and tension built between them. Also, the show seemingly forgets about the set of characters from or related to the astronomy club for no real reason.\\n\\n\r\nDespite these tiny mishaps, the cast still differentiate themselves throughout the season, and their romances allow them to grow in tangible ways. A set of positives that make their efforts in the bakery worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nMuch like the artistry, Tsurezure Children puts the most care for its audio into the characters with very solid voice acting for each of them. While nearly every role strikes at cuteness or fun, without a doubt the best performance comes out of Haruka Tomatsu as Hotaru.\\n\\n\r\nShe only has a couple of scenes, but her introductory one turns into something arguably memorable. Different pitches, emotions, and noises in the span of almost three minutes demonstrate her skill and boost the execution of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the VA performances, the music rests comfortably in the passable category. The opening track \u201cAimai Moko\u201d is a nice little song whose acoustic guitar, chimes, eventual violins, and cheerful tone follow the anime\u2019s own lighthearted feel.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the ending track \u201cDear\u201d leads the audience out of each episode with a gentle pull as a slow vocal delivery and soft piano keys ring out in the background. And the rest of the original soundtrack goes for daintier instrumentation for both its comedic and dramatic segments, giving the show\u2019s scenes a stronger foundation to stand upon.\\n\\n\r\nIn total, the OP, the ED, and the OST are collectively one of the weaker parts of the show, but the VA performances rise above its average brethren. Ensuring that the audio quality of Tsurezure Children does not fall into anywhere unfavorable.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nRomance is my jam, and this anime was jam packed with romance. So, naturally, I quite liked it.\\n\\n\r\nEach couple brought something new to the table that got me smiling on my face and giddy in my soul. Ryouko and Akagi had a lot of maturity as they bullied and quarreled with each other. Kana and Chiaki synchronized their antics and worked hard to push their relationship forward. Ayaka and Takeru shared their thoughts and wants openly to deepen their connection.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s not even half of them. Kanda and Takase overjoyed while texting. Chizuru trying to come to terms with her feelings for Sugawara as he tried to make his for her known. Motoyama supporting Chiyo and Yamane like a true bro. And Yuki teasing Jun constantly as Hotaru tried to interfere. Essentially, I was rooting for every couple\u2019s success, and I was laughing with happiness while doing so.\\n\\n\r\nI also really appreciated the kindhearted atmosphere. Yes, tiny conflicts popped up on a rare basis, but the content made sure to take on a positive spin as much as it could. I didn\u2019t have to worry about anything mean going down, and it was obvious that, if any problems did arise, they would inevitably correct themselves in the best way possible. This atmosphere, combined with the fun couples and their awesome romances, made this show a super-fun experience.\\n\\n\r\nTsurezure Children is a short anime with a lot to offer. The focus on love for its story and its characters create many a heartfelt, comedic moment for the audience to like. And the audiovisual design, while not too impressive, has its spare shining qualities as well. This concluding description is just one of the million ways in which to give this project praise.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, an unending buffet of yummy Valentine\u2019s Day cupcakes\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Good, the different, colorful character designs take precedence over the interesting stylistic choices and other passable aspects of the visual presentation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, the members of this very large cast have distinct representations even with the short runtime, and their romances allow them to grow for the better, but focus on specific ones is lost along the way\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Fine, some nice VA performances carry the audio forward as the OP, the ED, and the OST watch from the sidelines\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, jam packed with romantic goodness\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

In Toradora, as with many anime it takes the main characters forever to realize and express their truefeelings (although tbh that was great, like how good is Toradora?). \\n\\n\r\nBut typically, the characters in romance anime can be infuriating in the way they approach their feelings. What Tsurezure children does well is that it does not leave you to perish with a sinking ship that is a painfully slow romantic development. \\n\\n\r\nAllow me to elaborate because so far this review sucks. I promise it might get better.\\n\\n\r\nThere are such a wide variety of characters in Tsurezure Children that you are bound to find ones you like. Although for me it was the case that I liked almost all of them, but BECAUSE the cast is so large I was bound to find ones I did not like.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are someone who likes quick development in a relationship, there's a couple for you.\\n\\n\r\nIf you prefer a long, drawn out development with lots of slip ups and painful misunderstandings, there's a couple for you.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like the loli-esque shy girl who underestimates how kawaii she is but slowly gains the confidence to address the feelings she has about a boy in her class, there's a couple for you.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like the loudmouth tsundere who really just wants to tell the boy she cares about how she feels but can't bring herself to do it in a way that isn't off-putting, there's a couple for you.\\n\\n\r\nIf, for some reason you like the nerdy kid who refuses to believe any girl will ever love him and freaks THE FUCK OUT whenever he talks to anyone of the opposite gender, unfortunately there's a couple for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe point is, the major variety seen in Tsurezure children is what makes it so damn great. There's something for everyone to enjoy. But it doesn't get a 10 from me because there is also something for everyone to hate.\\n\\n",

I ended up forgetting about it and just now finished it. \r\nBut this was a fun show that has some pretty awesome moments in it. Such as one of the characters sister being messed around with by the girlfriend.\r\nWhile i do enjoy this and it's fun . The issue i have with it is two things.\r\n1. The story doesn't have an actual ending for a lot of the characters. Such as the Student Council President and the Delinquent and more. \r\n2. While it isn't really bad. It can be annoying how its not just onestory in a row. We get one story chopped up into pieces over multiple episodes. This can be alright but for me i just wish we could watch all of one duo's story with it not being over the span of 12 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also has in my opinion two of the greatest couples in anime of 2017\\n\r\nAkagixRyouko and TakanoxTakurou \\n\\n\r\nI really love these two groups. I would honestly love to see AkagixRyouko have their own story. They are really good on screen and funny. The other Duo is also pretty good. I don't know if they could do their own story by them self.\\n\\n\r\nReally good story and is fun to just watch.",

I didn't think I'd like it when I first heard of it, but after the first episode I was hooked.\r\nTsurezure Children is about different couples at the same school. There are aorund 9 couples and every episode is only 12 minutes long, so they show 3 or 4 couples each episode.\r\nThat kind of bugged me, tbh. Some couples got a lot (and I mean A LOT) of screen time, while other couples only appear once or twice throughout the entire series. Because of that, I couldn't really get into some of the relationships.\r\nHowever, I reallyliked how none of the couples (or characters for that matter) were the same. Yet all of them were shipable. That made up for the screen time-thingy.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is really enjoyable and I ended up falling in love with it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"12 minutes per ep and focusing on 4 different couples every ep? How in the world would that work?\" That was my first thought before I started the show, and here we are 12 episodes later and I've become a self-inflicted diabetic BECAUSE OH MY GOD THIS SHOW IS TOO FLUFFY. (But with a tinge of angst too ;)) \r\nYou'd think with so many characters and relationships and stories to tell with such limited time, how would they accomplish it? Won't it get all choppy and messy? Won't you feel detached from the characters? Well for me at least, I gladly answer no to theprevious two questions. Tsurezure Children does a spectacular job of being a romance anime, and it does the audience a favour by shaving off all the unnecessary roundabouts and extra boring tidbits and surges straight to the good juicy moments of romance and fluff that we all came for. I guarantee anyone in the single squad will think \"man, I want to fall in love\" at least a couple times throughout indulging this show, it is that powerful. \\n\\n\r\nWhat one might see as the show's possible biggest downfall of too many relationships, was crafted out to be the show's greatest strength, and that is the explorations of how silly adolescent relationships functions, their different dynamics and how people with different personalities are matched together and henceforth their cute interactions with each other. It really is a breath of fresh air and makes you want to root for them. There is no drama, no tragedy, none of that sad shit, just tons and tons of sugar and everything sweet. That's not to say its one-dimensional, because the show isn't short of heartwarming scenes that reached out to me emotionally. \\n\\n\r\nBut my intention here isn't to put in on a pedestal and market it as some masterpiece, because it really isn't, hence my rating of only 8/10. One of the issues I have with it (that really isn't its fault in the first place per se) but WHY IS IT ONLY 12 MINUTES LONG AND ONLY 12 EPISODES IN THIS SEASON??? So for fear of it only being a season long without a sequel, and given its current far from completion state, I can only give it such a score. \\n\\n\r\nBut nonetheless, I enjoyed myself very much and got a better glimpse of having a high school romance, something that I don't have and probably won't have xD",

            "content": "High school romances are often the most delicate things.\u00a0 The fragility of youth is complimented by equally fragile yet pure relationships that're formed when two people discover feel their pulse quicken when being near the people they want to spend time with.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nStory: Tsurezure Children follows a rotating cast of characters where each of its twelve minute long episode is split into three parts, each part focusing on a different couple or in some cases, successive parts that focus on the same pair.\u00a0 With it, the show gives off a sense of progress as each couple grows closer to each other and gives the viewer avariety of stories varying from those that lead up to the typical confession scene in most romance shows, or show us the rockiness or steadiness of different relationships given the two parties involved.\u00a0 As a result, the show is quite varied and despite the flipflop, feels like it has more to it due to the progressive feeling of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe one downside for the story however is how a good number of the couples really don't get that much screentime.\u00a0 More than half of all of the featured couples in this show are barely given any attention, so it becomes awkward to watch when you're following one couple and their story for the past two weeks, but all of a sudden, these people who haven't gotten any mention since episode two show up and suddenly get a bit to themselves.\u00a0 The imbalance is quite clear towards the end of the series, and it's a bit of a disappointment cause some of my more favorite couples are those that didn't get much attention at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Varied show with a sense of progress\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Heavy imbalance with the presentation of some couples\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Honestly there is no way you're gonna remember the characters.\u00a0 At least a majority of them.\u00a0 More than anything, the show sets them up in such a way that should you forget their names, the interactions with their partner are recognizable enough for you to remember which couple is being featured at a given time, something that was quite common for me because the later episodes pretty much focused on only two to three of the total eight or so couples in this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe imbalance with the stories becomes painfully clear when Gouda and Kamine or Kana and Chiaki become the only centerpieces the show is willing to focus on.\u00a0 (Maybe Sugawara and Takano too.)\u00a0 I remember those names specifically because the show liked to focus on their story so much that they completely disregarded the astronomy girl or even the couple who had the first scene in the whole series without batting an eye.\u00a0 Indeed while some of the lesser stories got enough attention to fulfill some kind of small saga, and others are larger in detail and require more time for an overarching story, I can't help but shake the feeling that things could've turned out better with better screentime balance.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Large cast of still recognizable characters\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Imbalance becomes painfully clear later on in the series (I only remember about half of the couples' names by heart.)\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by Studio Gokumi, Tsurezure Children bears a simple style with bold and easy colors complimented by the cartoonish nature of the character designs.\u00a0 While the art quality itself isn't that amazing, it's the character designs that's the art's selling point.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character is defined in both hair color and hair design.\u00a0 Personally I think this is a really good way of distinguishing a large cast because during the switch to a different story, the couples's hair color ends up becoming the main indicator for the audience as to who we're focusing on since pretty much everyone has a different style or color to their hair, making us think \"Oh, this couple\" rather than struggling to remember their names and what quirk they have.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Simple yet bold artstyle\\n\r\n+ Different hair colors makes couple distinguishing easy (Probably overthinking it, but it's my theory.)\\n\\n\r\nSound: Performed by Inori Minase, the show's OP \"Aimai Moko\" is a cheerful and happy song that despite sounding good, isn't really all that memorable if I may be honest.\u00a0 There's nothing about it that screams memorable and honestly wasn't a song that appeared in my radar.\u00a0 The rest of the soundtrack I feel is the same way so there's really nothing special to note here.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Despite the imbalance, Tsurezure Children was a fun watch.\u00a0 It had all of the elements of a bunch of different romance anime without cluttering itself because the show always focused on only one story at a time.\u00a0 I admit I was mildly annoyed by how the show only just told the story of two of the existing couples.\u00a0 Especially because there were so many others who were just as deserving of that screentime but didn't get the time of day to really show a lot of progress.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\r\nMore specifically, I like Hanakana's character, Minagawa.\u00a0 Her and Furuya were my favorite couple out of the lot and I'm so sad that they didn't get more screentime.\u00a0 It was fucking gold and I wanted more.\u00a0 Why didn't you give us more?!\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\r\nHonestly, Gouda and Kamine's relationship is...boring.\u00a0 Or at least the show made it boring.\u00a0 Every time they came on, it was the exact same thing with not much progression to move things along.\u00a0 Puppy love is cute and all, but if you're not gonna do much with it, you might as well give the screentime to a couple who needs it.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\r\nIf you want something cute, Tsurezure Children is a really good fit.\u00a0 It fits along a broad spectrum of different romance stories and packs them all in a neat little series that works surprisingly well despite having eight or so different stories happening at once.\u00a0 Indeed the imbalance is annoying and your favorite couple might not get the time of day, but the show is still fun and enjoyable to watch, so I would recommend it.",

The constant swapping from one character to the next keeps the pace light and comedy fresh, as you never get too tired of one couple before they introduce thenext. \\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, I liked almost every single character in the anime, and could find myself relating and investing myself into their struggles. If anything, the worst part of the show is that some of the characters don't receive enough time in the spotlight, and are kind of dropped as the series goes on. \\n\\n\r\nYet, the show provided enough closure and happiness for my favorite pairings, and I ended up with a dumb grin on my face as I finished it so I can't help but recommend the show to anyone looking for something lighthearted, funny, or cute.

            "content": "I didn't have a lot of high expectations when I was diving into this, solely because I never heard of this anime before, and according to others post-review, they heard others say it's good, and this anime even got a good rating. My girlfriend and I decided to watch it so we did, and this is what I came out with.\r\nI've seen romance and comedy and enjoyed my fair share. But Tsurezure is without a doubt, one of the most generic romance anime I have ever seen in my entire life. And ironically enough, this is coming from someone that just got back into theanime watching groove. The story is absolute garbage, and while it is blatantly obvious of the content you'll receive, what you actually watch doesn't make it anymore bearable.\\n\\n\r\nQuite honestly, I think the Art is the only good thing about the show, but even that is sub par, and in a lot of aspects, it doesn't really stand out all that much, so that's not saying a whole lot.\\n\\n\r\nThere are only (in my mind anyways) 5 good characters, or at least characters that are some what memorable upon first impression. The others either fit the terrible cliche of \"dense af\", are bland with very little interesting personality at all, or they're just straight up annoying.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, there's just not a whole lot to say about the anime, but the execution of almost everything was just awful in so many ways. The atmosphere was really ruined in some cases because of how bad personalities are, and I'm all for opinions, but I don't see why people give this anime such a common praise. It's not really all that great and saying that it's great because it's romance/comedy isn't saying a whole lot. Nisekoi and Chuunibyou were both Romantic Comedy anime that was well executed, had really good characters, and the story wasn't just made from someone who wants to write the most generic romance story between people ever. This does not warrant a re-watch at all. Personally would not recommend this to anyone.",

            "content": "Ah young love. Such a sweet but complicated experience...that I have yet to have. However, this isn't about me. This is about an extremely heart warming anime through and through that was, as I said before, sweet, hilarious, and enjoyable.\r\nTsurezure Children focuses on the concept of young love and how it affects adolescence. While not all of the romance was great and the writers definitely made it more dramatic than it actually is, it's still an anime that is worth attention for all romantic comedy fans!\r\nStory - 7:\r\nAll I can say about the story is...they're all about love. That's right, \"they're\". Tsurezure Children story isn'tjust one story but a bunch of stories happening at once! They weren't anything monumental, but I can safely say that each story had personality with each situation being much different from the last! It definitely kept me engaged through and through. I was smiling, laughing, and cracking a few jokes here and there all from enjoyment! Of course, not all of the stories were great, but I'll go in depth about my feelings once we get to the character section.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I'll say is that some the stories were definitely forgotten. Ones appearing for one episode, have little screen, and never showing up again for the rest of the series. I guess the other romances were able to hold me over, but I would have really appreciated it if we went more in depth with some of these tales. The 12 episode limit is a pain, huh?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story or stories of Tsurezure Children are nice, relaxing, and hilarious to watch. Maybe hitting you in the feels here and there.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9:\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle while simplistic still turned out to be very eye catching to me. Character's expressions were drawn very well, being able to evoke so much emotion, as they should be. Not much else I can say. The artstyle of this anime is an A+ in my book!\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7: \\n\\n\r\nThe music wasn't bad either. A relaxing, but soothing tone in each song fits perfectly with the show's theme. The opening had a real upbeat attitude to it, letting you know immediately that it'll contain a lighter tone throughout the anime. Overall, music to my ears!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7:\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters weren't anything special themselves, most of them were a joy to watch! Thanks to their varying personalities, each character always brought life from within my laptop's screen and the comical moments involving them were priceless, especially Katori, which I wish we got to know more about since he's always bringing a dramatic but fun attitude to what's currently going on. Most of them were very relatable as well. Some being extremely nervous and questioning their next actions which I can wholeheartedly relate to!\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of wanting to see more of characters, some were completely abandoned unfortunately. Going back to what I said about the story, it felt like the staff making this were trying to put as much of the characters from the manga in as possible, but either left them alone after their debut episode or didn't appear at all. Also, I never read the manga. I did take a glimpse at a volume and noticed two characters that weren't in the anime at all! Hell, two characters who were in the opening for 12 straight episodes didn't appear until the final episode, but didn't provide them with their own story! It kinda felt like they were just shoved in there and hopefully it'll all work itself out. It did...to an extent and at a point where I wish we could see more of those two and other characters not shown in the anime.\\n\\n\r\n**THIS IS WHERE I GET TO SPOILER TERRITORY! IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE READING, SCROLL DOWN UNTIL YOU REACH ANOTHER CAPPED SENTENCE WITH TWO STARS NEXT TO IT LIKE THIS ONE**\\n\\n\r\nTwo characters who kind of pissed me off a little were the first couple introduced in the very first episode; Haruhiko Takase and his female heroine Saki Kanda. As seen in the episode 1, Saki accidentally confessed her feelings to Haruhiko right before moving on to the next couple. Now you can't tell me Haruhiko was dense as fuck because he obviously took notice. Haruhiko, she LIKES you! You KNOW that now! You LIKE her as well! CONFESS TO HER! Next time we see them, it's like nothing ever happened and I don't get it! WHY DIDN'T ANYONE MAKE A MOVE?! The author definitely dragged this out more than he actually needed to because he already established their love for each other and one of them just blurted it out, but the other is not doing anything about it and acted like nothing ever happened! What's worse, THEY NEVER GOT TOGETHER! This couple was a complete, misunderstood, mess! Most likely, this relationship goes deeper in the manga, but until I've read that, this was definitely my least very story out of all the others in here.\\n\\n\r\n**SAFE! YOU MAY PROCEED READING TO MY REVIEW! HOPE YOU'RE HAVING FUN! :D**\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, most of the characters were a treat to watch. Some were greatly developed and others were either severely underdeveloped, very poorly executed, or just gone like an irrelevant thought. Hopefully this gets a season 2 because I'd love to see more of these amazing characters, new additions, and improve others who I weren't so fond of.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8:\\n\\n\r\nThis is my 2nd time watching this anime and I still absolutely love it! It was funny, heart warming, and little bit emotional at times. Even showed some life lessons hidden within some of the stories like trying hard will get you somewhere and draw others to you or don't force anything or it'll all come crashing down, etc. I'm not sure what else I can say about this anime. Everything was such a pleasure to watch!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nTsurezure Children is an awesome anime with memorable characters, fantastic moments, and will leave you missing every single element within it. Definitely recommend it if you're into romantic comedy, but if you also want an anime you can quickly binge watch, this is good too! Each episode is only 12 minutes long!\\n\\n\r\nI'm praying this gets a season 2! I want to see more of these characters grow and see how their stories end, because some were surely left unfinished. Until then, I might pick up the manga if I ever get the chance! :D",

I know you guys are unsatisfied about the ending because it doesn't really end the story about the other lovers. Although it's an 12 mns Anime it actually pretty amusing and fun to watch but if I'm gonna say something i highly recommend to you guys to read  the manga if you want more romantic scene and there are other characters that is in the manga but not showed in theanime and they're pretty interesting too, I'm talking about other lovers and a partner for those who doesn't have a partner (ex.Motoyama, Tomomichi). Anyways this Anime is one of my favorites this season despite that it leaves us hanging, you might wanna consider reading the manga.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPS: Ryouko and Akagi is my favorite couple <3",

            "content": "This anime is fairly good. I like the story quite a lot. I won't spoil any of it here though, I guess i just have to talk about why i liked it so much.\r\nYou follow these characters around and watch them interract with each other, which makes them feel super real. I just can't get enough of social interaction because it is frankly something us anime reviewers don't get enough of so we instead watch fictional characters having more fun than us.\r\nThe story feels real. It is something that can happen in real life too, but never will. Again, I won't spoil too much becauseI feel like it will ruin the story. Frankly, just get some weeb friends and watch this together, you will have a blast!\\n\\n\r\nArt is great. Everything looks great, the lightning effect are not overused they are only used in the perfect moments. The animation is fluid and it feels very cinematic. It is quite rare that animes are animated this good! I was disapointed in Attack on Titans animation and artstyle (very ugly, shaders everywhere and no good looking girls). But Tsurezure Children uses their resourses they have and use it to the 100% potential. Very few animes use this. It is not 100% perfect, it seems lacking at times but it is still very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound is good! The soundtrack is just amazing and the voice acting is really good too. Nakazama-chan is my favorite voice actor on the market. just listen to the soundtracks on youtube or dailymotion\\n\\n\r\ncharacters are very well made and is probably the reason u watch this show. Very much like the story, i wont spoil the good parts. some characters seem a little lacking, but they make up for it later in the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. I enjoyed this show\\n\\n\r\noverall very good i recommend this show to everyone that likes anime and want some good to watch this show. thank 4 the readz!\\n\\n\r\nDesu Desu",

What really captures the audience is the great characters and how intriguing their relationships are. My personal favorite relationships are with Chizuru + Takurou and Takera + Ayaka. Chizuru is a very cute, sweet girl who thinks that she isn't worth anything. This is really bad for Takurou because he is hopelessly in love with her, leading to so many misunderstandings. Takera is oblivious to everything Ayaka does, but he's really sweet and she's so adorable. I fell in love with these couple almost right away.\r\nTherelationships do fall into some cliches, but many of them are hilarious and relatable in some way or another. Self-doubt is something that all of these characters go through and it is so similar to our real relationships.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want an anime where you can see the birth of a new couple without any fillers, then this is the anime for you. It's not perfect and you probably will only really like one or two couples like I did, but it is extremely enjoyable and it just feels really good to watch.",

A romance anime like this one is a rare occurence, I'll tell you why.\r\nRarily do they portray relationships in a semi realistic matter sure you can name like four that do it perfectly but that's sifting through the piles of sub-par romance anime that come out each year. For some reason I found the relationships in this anime to very believable and grounded it deals with real relationship issues like your first time, your partners habits and so on in such a well rounded and light hearted way. Each couple has their ownchemistry that makes the show very enjoyable to watch and leaves your heart in a flutter, and they all felt believable and not shallow like so many other anime coming out at the moment.\\n\\n\r\nHighly recommend if your looking for something different.\\n\r\nEpisodes are short though something that originally turned me off and did effect its ability to cover more ground especially with the ensemble of characters still worth it though.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\n2017 continues to be a year, where I watch anime's that are less than 20 minutes long, I have ran into a few that are either pretty damn bad or pretty damn good and for Tsurezure Children it was definitely pretty damn good.\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nTsurezure Children focuses on the developing relationships between certain couples in high school, that's pretty much the gist of the story, however there is a lot more to it than that.\r\nThe best part of the story is seeing these couples going through different, although similar problems and how they can overcome these problems, it was really interesting how each couplewas different too, they weren't always lovey dovey with each other and some couples didn't even become proper couples by the end of the series.\\n\r\nIt shows how mysterious love works and it is different for every person who experiences it, although I think the one downside this show has, is that it doesn't fully conclude some couples stories like Takase and Saki or even Furuya and Yuki who I felt didn't have a complete story, which makes me feel like a season 2 could be possible in the future although I'm unsure that will happen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were definitely the best part of the show and I won't be signalling out any specific couples in this section.\\n\r\nThe way each couple acts is really different and well done, because I had no idea where they would be at the end of each episode or segment since there is 4 per episode, some of the problems for some of the couples may seem very minor to some people, but to others it might be a big thing, for example holding hands or just getting closer to each other can be difficult for some couples and they expressed that very well.\\n\r\nOn the other hand there's those couples who were a lot more open with each other and even made for a few great laughs, because of how savage or funny the jokes were when they were talking to each other.\\n\r\nThere are also some couples who go through difficult hardships, because they can't agree with each other or one of the members of the couple ends up taking a joke too far, which ends up with them breaking up showing that being in a relationship isn't easy.\\n\r\nEven then there are characters who have screentime, that aren't even in a couple situation like Shinichi Katori, who just goes around giving couple advice for some of the characters, plus he was a pretty cool guy, but something in the back of my head makes me think he is gay, hence why he isn't in a relationship with any of the girls.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI will admit, the design of the characters definitely looks simple, but quite unique at the same time, although the hair reminds me of Love Tyrant where it just looks like play-doh to me, another thing that stood out for me though was how creepy the characters smiles were sometimes, I mean seriously how did any of the characters not pull a muscle making a smile as big as that.\\n\r\nOther than that there wasn't really much else that stood out for me in the artstyle section.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely the weakest section of the show, however that doesn't mean it's bad, the op was alright, but compared to other stuff from the summer period, it just doesn't stand out too much and the soundtrack wasn't really memorable either.\\n\\n\r\nExtras: \\n\\n\r\nFor being a Romance this did the job very well and captured the couples reactions to certain things in a surprising way I wasn't quite expecting, plus I didn't have a favourite couple either showing how well done the characters were and also the fact that the couples felt very varied, because each one felt different to me and not the same bull I've seen in some Romance anime's.\\n\r\nThe Comedy was also done very well, it got a good amount of laughs from me and it also showed how embarrassing a relationship can be, like if you're doing something with the person you care about and then someone you know interrupts you, then it can be quite awkward, but for us it can be very funny while also relatable at the same time, also some of the couples were just generally funny like Masafumi and Ryouko, who despite the continuous arguments just surprised me and made me laugh quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a fun and enjoyable short episode series, the only problem's it had was that some couples didn't have a complete story, which is probably a setup for season 2 and the op and soundtrack wasn't that memorable to me, however if you're a person who likes Romance and some good comedy in you're anime, then this definitely a good watch.",

            "content": "Tsurezure Children\r\nMixed feelings about this one. Its light-hearted attempt at depicting couples teaching each other the meaning of love is too brief. The show in general is very shallow. From the beginning we\u2019re being introduced to, like what, ten to fifteen characters that navigate through high-school with this intent to ship themselves with someone: be it a long-time crush; a very close friend; or some acquaintance they just met by chance. I\u2019m not buying into the premise. Worst yet, for a RomCom, none of the writers and/or producers found it appropriate to deal with rejection. They couldn\u2019t be bothered with such topics i guess, asevery single confession in this show was met with a positive response (there was one exception but that scene was dreadful). Which further secures my impression that Tsurezure Children lacked depth, or any other dimension for that matter.\\n\\n\r\nGuys let\u2019s start pointing out the elephants in the room here. Number one, this show is episodic. There\u2019s no timeline. To that, no sense of progression: nothing is really being done. Secondly, the show deals with the goodness of loving relationships but the evolution of it is cut short. The show spreads itself too thin. Think about it...12 episodes; each 13 minutes in length for a dozen characters? Why set yourself up for failure? My guess is the writers thought it clever to \u201cre-invent the wheel\u201d here by providing for a narrative that tries itself different from the normal format used in RomComs. Nice try laddies, now try again. Given its limited airtime, and the lack of continuity from episode to episode guess what else the show lacked completely? Any form of interaction between the couples and the world around them. The series provides us with isolated incidents where only the two members of every couple actively participate; everything else around them stands still in the meanwhile. \\n\\n\r\nFor positivity however, I must concur that the show does provide for good humour. It\u2019s funny and it made me laugh quite often. There was something to admire about the naivete these children demarcated, paired with their general awkwardness. The show made it interesting enough to show value in some regards, while creating disappointment in others. Although I might be bummed out by what Tsurezure clearly lacked, it was refreshing to take a scenic tour appreciating the simpler things that such anime series can offer. Moreover, some of the scenes, outside of being entertaining to watch, depicted some flare of marvel, however short lived it might have been. Whomever is keen enough to peer through all 12 episodes will come to find that the people having created this show are no amateurs. Which further makes me wonder why they didn\u2019t take a leap further towards developing something that could have been more complete and substantive.\\n",

I stumbled upon Tsurezure Children, a rom-com anime that featured different aspects of romance in high school. The first two episodes took me a little bit to get used to, with the 12 minute air time, and having 3 four minute scenes, but as soon as I got with the pacing, I started to love the episodes.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nWith so many storylines, it could have been difficult to make them all work, but the show accomplishedthat and more. Each segment was interesting and fresh and balanced with romance and comedy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nEach character was very unique and had their own quirks and personalities, and they complemented each other very well.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation is colorful and light, and the music helped out with the many various themes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is one of those animes that made me verbally express how I felt about what I was watching, like encouraging a character to send that risky text.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nUsually I don't binge watch animes, but I couldn't help myself with this one. A very good watch if you're into the romance genre, and even if you're not! It kept me entertained throughout the whole season, and I can't wait for next season(please season 2).",

The theme is simple, \"A daily lives of couples seen from different perspective.\" and it never gets old, really. 6 episode so far and I'm enjoying myself. There are a lot of point of view here so all kind of viewer can relate to their experience one way or another. The thingis this anime is pretty short in duration (12 minutes per episode).

Sometimes, we just need simpler things in life and that thing is Tsurezure Children.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is straightforward, the song is simple and the soundtrack is super good.

That's what got me to the show in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Studio Gokumi finally makes an interesting project. They often choose weird animation project.

With that said, some characters were definitely more relatable than others, with others being quirky or plain weird.\r\nWith each episode being about 13 minutes, it delivers short stories touching on topics such as new-found love, missed chances, balancing two needs in a relationship, and many more. Needless to say, this is a good way to relive experiences thatcan bring about happiness or sorrow depending on your life choices.",

            "content": "Similar to the show this review will be rather short and direct to the point. \r\nThe idea of the show is rather simple, boy loves girl or girl loves boy, and things get rather awkward for some reason. The show goes directly into rapid fire mod and introduces us to couples after couples right off the bat, although this may sound negative it turns out to be a rather enjoyable and successful formula. However, if you have watched any romance or comedy (that has some romance) show in general, then you have most likely already seen most, if not all, of the possible situations thatthe couples in this series are put in.  The \u201cproblems\u201d they face range from the couple being shy to being immature or even na\u00efve at times, and like other romcom anime, characters would sporadically be placed in \u201cembarrassing\u201d situations.  \\n\\n\r\nThe score that I gave the show by no means reflects the enjoyment that I had watching it. If I am to rate it solely based on enjoyment, it would be much higher than what I have written, because the series never failed to make me smile or make me feel relaxed; however, I had a few problems with it. The foremost being the characters, this is probably the first time I have ever finished a show without remembering the names of any of the characters. I never really cared to actually know what their names were, to begin with; most will argue that \u201cIt\u2019s just a series of short gimmicks, you aren\u2019t supposed to emphasize on who\u2019s who\u201d. Well I mean yeah sure, but at the end of the day, that makes the show lose a lot of its value (to me at least) because I will easily forget about it soon enough. Moreover, I don\u2019t know why I could not binge watch the series, meaning I could not get myself to watch more than two episodes in a row despite the show being rather short (I waited till the show approached its end before I started watching it). Normally that would actually be a good thing because it would mean I am \u201cbrooding\u201d over it, but in this case, I just felt I was getting an overdose of \u201cwish-fulfilling pre-teen love\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nDespite everything, I really enjoyed the show and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a rather \u201cheart-warming\u201d experience. For better or for worst the show does not try to become anything more than what is written in its synopsis. An easily digestible romcom that delivers its intended goals, and does not outstay its welcome. \\n",

I just took into account each character's relationship and how their story/love actually developed. Most were really well done. There were some others that kind of got forgotten and the anime tried to bring them back later in the anime but I felt like it didn't work out.\r\nArt and Animation: The anime seems to be pretty original art and animation wise. While It's not most people cup of tea, I highly enjoyed it. Very easy on the eyes and very enjoyable.\r\nSound and Acting:The music was really good and the voice acting was Perfect. No problems at all with the VA's for each character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: There is literally not one character that came close to being disliked in this anime for me I seriously loved them all and rooted for them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. If they made it 24 minutes but kept it the way it is with short 6-8 minute stories It would be better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed this anime. Highly recommended to anyone who wants a really good and funny romantic comedy anime. With nice bits of Slice of Life involved.",

It\u2019s both the series\u2019 greatest strength and gravest weakness that strangely enough compensate each other so well as to elevate the series above much of the genre.\r\nTsurezure Children is a testament to how much can be implied without showing anything at all. To make up for the limited screentime that should have crippled character progression and investment, Tsurezure Children draws on our experience and our little forays into young love to fill in the lines asit were, as it weaves little narratives that centers around the higher points of a romance story, leaving much of the build-up untold.\\n\\n\r\nSuch a setup forces us into a quandary where it would only work if and when we feel a connection to the couple in question. Fortunately, the series comes with a variety of pairings and at least one of which have struggles that connects to us, speaks to our inner romantic, and demands our investment.\\n\\n\r\nThe couple may be set and the shipping arguments laid null, but there\u2019s always a little something for everyone: a couple or two whose journey you would prefer the most.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll keep this review short and sweet, much like the series.

As an anthology of shorts, all on the theme of youthful romantic troubles, every episode has sweetness and hilarity served up on short order, without the need to watch a whole shoujo series for the payoff. A good build-up can make the moment of truth even stronger, but since everyone will naturally root for young love, the briefest stories, with lively dialogue and scenarios, can be sweetly moving.\r\n It's to be expected that segments are of uneven quality and become a little forced and predictable by the halfway mark.Although the characters are commendably distinctive, different and include real standouts, their motives are essentially similar, and as slow to be progressed as if this was a 50 ep rom-com rather than a short series. In short this isn't a great rom-com like Torodora, but well worth a watch for discerning fans of short anime.",

Many of us turn into an awkward, flustered, and cringey bundle of foolishness because we have no idea how to initially go on about a relationship, but despite the embarrassments, lovebirds will try to make their relationship work together. That's the part that touches me the most and Tsurezure Children shows us just how endearing that quality is.\r\nA simple change on a fluffy anime genre is all you need to describe the heart of the show: Cute Couples Doing Cute Things.\r\nRomanticlove is multifaceted as there is virtually a limitless number of ways two people can fall in love with each other. It's the reason why love is such a complex thing, and Tsurezure Children manages to explore the diversity of this powerful emotion in a very heartwarming way. Rather than focusing solely on one couple, we are quickly introduced to several ones. It might have been a recipe for disaster to have a large variety of pairings in a short anime, but thankfully, the show understands how to treat every relationship with light care. Each episode delves right into the many ways romance can affect different couples, and because of this constant switching of perspectives, the wide assortment of lovey-dovey exchanges leads to an engaging story. Really, it's a simple show, but the fact it knows how to keep itself dynamic and fresh at all times\u2014with a healthy dose of cuteness\u2014makes it easy to indulge in its light-hearted atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nAs playful as the show is, there are also some angst and mild drama to be found here. Remember, young love can be a constant struggle because of this thing we call inexperience, so it's obvious not every relationship will be smooth sailing. It might be frustrating to see some of the couples seemingly return back to their status quo when you know their infatuation for each other is strong enough they should just get married already, but it's all part of the reality the show wants to communicate to us; the things that love can entail to young people including the problematic sides. Setbacks can happen in a relationship and Tsurezure Children is not afraid to show that, which makes the experience even better when the characters learn from their mistakes to develop further. For the most part though, the show is like a velvety wedding cake with a great comedic flavor and enough sweet personality to die for\u2014all of which are the ingredients of enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just like the simple narrative elements, the audiovisual lies in the same basic spectrum too\u2014but it works for a show like this. You can easily distinguish every character even with their straightforward designs and the visual is fluid enough to capture the feelings of being love-struck. The soundtracks, on the other hand, are really light they're honestly forgettable, but the voice-acting is a lovely accompaniment to the vast amount of personality, whether it's for the comically flamboyant or the awkwardly shy. \\n\\n\r\nSo, all things considered, Tsurezure Children is an ideal anime for those looking to enjoy some young love appeal in the form of a short rom-com. It's heartwarming yet believable at the same time, and the diverse range of relationships works to unite the complex feeling we call romantic love into a simple heart-shaped sweetness. Seeing all the affection bloom in this show has definitely been a pleasant experience.",

            "content": "[TL;DR: Short, sweet, with some nice humor. A story about young love, told through many different couples and situations. Great story bits stringed together haphazardly in a trope-storm, that results in one of the most unique rom-com installments I watched to date. Art and sound is bland, but the story makes up for it. Binge it, or you'll lose track of the many characters!]\r\nA story must have a beginning, a middle and an end, or so they say. Well, Tsurezure Children has...none of those. Rather, it's basically five or so separate rom-com stories stitched together to form a sort of Franken-anime, where characters from onestory are the support cast in the other stories, and it all forms a hot mess that somehow...works!\\n\\n\r\nThe only common thread in the story is that the characters all go to the same school. You'll find pretty much all the usual tropes: the student council prez, the cool one, the shy one, the delinquent, the nerd, the tsundere (of course), the childhood friend, the clueless, the class clown, etc. The pairings might look weird, but that's the thing, love does not supposed to make sense. If two people love each other, they find a way to make it work...usually. \\n\\n\r\nThe stories start off at different stages of the rom-com timeline. Some start with the confession, and they try to work out how relationships supposed to work, some start with a vague hint of \"do I really like him/her?\", and everything in-between. This might be a tad confusing at first, and I can't say it gets easier. You really have to pay attention to what happens, or it's easy to lose track or what's going on. The series is also pretty short, only 12 episodes with 12 minutes of runtime each (including the OP and ED).  That's woefully too little to cram this much content into, so the pacing is all over the place. It's all straight to business, everything not absolutely necessary has been cut. It's the \"filet mignon\" of rom-coms. Bite-sized bits of love and fun without all the fluff. Just the characters and their love life, no establishment shots, no scenery, no long gazes into each other's eyes, no pauses for effect, ain't nobody got time for that! This makes for very thick and exhilarating episodes with basically no downtime or boring parts, but it also negates two of the most crucial elements of romance and comedy: buildup and timing. One of the key components in making a story like this, is the careful buildup and release of romantic tension and the timing of comic relief. You mess any of that up, and you story's gonna be sub-par. All of that is kinda absent in Tsurezure Children, with the story making you fill in the implied parts, which makes the whole thing feel rushed and unfinished. This is one series that would've definitely deserved either a full season of 24 episodes or a much longer runtime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound suffered the same fate. Don't get me wrong, the anime is far from bad, but it's also far from great as well. It's nice, easy to look at and basically functional, but that's that. Romance is the one genre that benefits exceptionally well from carefully constructed visuals, beautiful art and awesome music/VO. Instead, Tsurezure Children operates with bland pastels, lots of still shots, talking heads, and forgettable background noise. While the stories would be great in themselves, I feel the creators didn't really have the time and/or the budget to really bring out the real quality this would've deserved. It's a real shame.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Tsurezure Children is a nice bit of rom-com with a unique way of storytelling. A bit rushed and lackluster in some areas, but it's full of personality and content. If you like romance with tons of characters, lots of different perspectives and a no-nonsense full-tilt gait, Tsurezure Children is a great one to binge on a boring afternoon!",

            "content": "If I had to choose a single word to describe this show, it would be this: fun. Tsurezure Children is a lighthearted romantic comedy that knows exactly what it is and what it wants to do. That may sound like nothing much, but it is very much true. \r\nThe story of this show is practically non-existent. This isn't a problem, however; Tsurezure Children more than makes up for its lack of plot with a wonderfully colorful cast of characters that make you wish each episode were longer than 12 minutes, simply so that you can experience more of their antics. Each character-- and each relationshipat that-- feels unique and very enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nWhat this show has a step above over other romantic comedies is that of its numerous relationships; nearly every single introduction of a pairing is also the moment the two characters confess to each other. There are no boring, drawn-out confessions that take half a season to finish. Tsurezure Children takes the arguably most boring part of a romance anime and turns it into something to laugh at and get invested in at the same time. It never meanders, which is a fresh breath of air for the romance genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime may take some getting used to at first but I would consider it good. Nothing off-putting, surely. The OST and sound effects are fine as well. \\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply, if you like romantic comedies, watch this. I highly doubt you will be disappointed.\\n",

Tsurezure is THE anime for you.\r\nWhile the story is very basic (we follow the love story of different couples), the characters are fairly enjoyable and the art is stainless.\r\nSTORY\r\nThis is the life of different couples in high-school. End of story. While the pitch is very basic, the comedy in it makes it very enjoyable to follow. Some situations are hilariously absurd while some others have unexpected falls.\r\nART\r\nThis anime is very short : it has 12 episodes, each 10 min long. As a result, the art is very clean. I didn't noticeany breaking issues : the animation is smooth, the drawings are clean, the light effects are wonderful.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nWhile the OST may not be memorable, it still fits the mood perfectly. Also, the opening is wonderful. As for the seiyuus, they do the job naturally.\\n\r\nAgain, no real issues on that side.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nThat's where this show is very interesting. While each character doesn't get much screentime (way too many characters for such a short anime), they still manage to make each character pleasant.\\n\r\nFirst, they are very diverse. From the Dating Master who always comes out of nowhere and acts in style, to the best wingman ever (aka Motoyama), and of course we don't forget the cute girls, there is a lot of personalities to discover.\\n\r\nThat said, we might be annoyed by how clueless many of those characters are. But that's really the one and only issue with those characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nI watched this show for the comedy (I had seen some really fun scenes on YouTube), and in the end I didn't get that only. This is really the only rom com anime that I fairly enjoyed, due to the pleasant mood, due to the funny characters and situations, due to the absolute sweetness that comes out of it.\\n\r\nMy only regret as of now is that it is too short.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this is not an anime for people who want food for thoughts. The story is basic and the characters are ordinary people. But this anime is so sweet, it might actually be an effective cure for depression!",

I came into the series thinking it would be some corny average piece of work, but it has been emotionally amazing in the way it\u2019s plot, characters, as well as artwork in the expressions has been done. \r\nPlot:9\r\nTsurezure Children has a very interesting way of doing their plot. They break up each 10min long episode into shorter mini-stories that link to each other via different episodes. I thought this was weird at first, but it actually helped he storyline since you got to see all of the couples in each episode rather than justone or two. The plot was definitely well written, so well written that my heart would ache each episode without fail. In terms of plot, it is near flawless. There were only a few arcs that I didn\u2019t really enjoy (I.e Kana/Chiaki)\\n\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nFacial expressions were drawn with detail in this anime. They really helped with both plot and character development. While it isn\u2019t as good as other series, this is likely due to the series not being heavily fanservice focussed or art focussed, which I perceive to be a good thing. It is still great nevertheless.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nProbably the only thing I can really fault with the series. The OST was ok, but other than that, the music wasn\u2019t really obvious/audible. Nothing wrong with it in particular though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Developmet: 10\\n\r\nPretty much the purpose of the anime was to explore characters going through the phases of love. It is very reminiscent of a time when I fell in love, and is definitely something that contributed to the series being so great. He character development was pretty much flawless.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, there is hardly anything I can fault in this amazing series. It has gained an impressive 10 from me, which goes to show how good it actually is. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the genre.",

I gotta say, I am a sucker for Rom-Coms.\r\nTsurezure Children is a romantic comedy series based on a small 4 panel comic series (if I'm not mistaken). It centers around the usual high school romantic hi-jinks, however it adds a multitude of them to give a sense of flavor, progression, and diversity to each relationship.\r\nThe interest in this simple series (being only 12 minutes and 12 episodes adds a lot of simple storylines and relationships), is finding a couple you either identify or empathize with and following their story. I'd have trouble picking one favoritecouple, but the way that each express interest, love, and dedication is definitely compelling. If you're looking for a depressing series, this definitely isn't it. There are very few instances of \"unrequited love\" and most aren't shown after if that's the result (as far as screentime).\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, if you just want to watch something, cute, fun, loveable, and romantic, it's a great series to take a break from your action packed shonen, dreary dialogue oriented anime, or your somber slice of life. It's simple, it's nice, and it's wholesome.",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Tsurezure Children. TC takes the romantic comedy angle and puts a twist in it. Its interesting but not without flaws.\r\nThere isn't a standard story, rather there is a formula to the episodes. The first several episodes revolve around characters and their confessions to their person of interest. The later episodes revolve around couples still trying to make the confessions happen, and couples trying to figure out how to be couples.\r\nHonestly the show starts off ok. Each character and scene has a touch of real to it, and it isn't often you get shows where a relationship isformed off the bat. The reason many shows don't, is because they want the tension and time to get to know the characters. You don't get the same tension in this show, nor do you have time to get to know or care about the characters. \\n\\n\r\nEach episode is basically the same after the confessions where the couples will agonize over their first kiss or whether or not to hold hands. As a shy guy myself I totally understand these problems. However they are given the liberty of exploring any and all problems that can arise in relationships, yet all we get is hand holding and kissing problems?\\n\\n\r\nRegardless the show was an enjoyable watch. Anyone who likes Rom Com anime will like this show. There are some really good moments with each couple and it was interesting to watch them fumble around. I wish they would have limited the characters and expanded on each one a bit more. Otherwise I recommend it.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Fun and short. Could have had a bit more focus.",

            "content": "TL;DR 9/10 the very few things it does, it does right. Short and sweet.\r\nTsurezure Children is a RomCom, I suppose, but in actuality its multiple different romcoms.\r\nEach of the episodes are only around 12 minutes long, half as long as most anime, and even then, each of the episodes are split into 3-4 different \"mini-stories\" involving the characters, usually the couples. \r\n---\r\nThe premise is to provide all of the meat or a romcom without any of the filler.\r\nThere are six or seven different couples, each with their own mini-stories.\r\nSome couples have been dating for a while, some start darting during the anime, and of coursesome like each other, but don't actually date.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nWhat I truly like about Tsurezure Children is that it just felt really wholesome and cute. It's the Kirby of anime (except Kirby actually does have an anime but just ignore that).\\n\\n\r\nThe backbone of it is just the normal Romantic Comedy (as in COMEDY involving ROMANCE), the stuff you would except in something like Nisekoi, except ACTUAL DEVELOPMENT HAPPENS(well, at least for some of them. Again, lots of stories = lots of variety).\\n\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nThere is no overarching plot, so I gave it a 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe art does its job. It never felt like an Ufotable Fate/Zero fight scene, but I never felt like \"god, this is bad animation\". Its consistently good for what it's worth. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP + ED were decent. The OST was too. I liked them, but its not like that's what I focused on.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nFinally, of course, is the characters, the main appeal of the show. I quite literally liked every single character in this entire anime. They all felt relatable, yet also someone I would like to be friends with. 10/10 considering how little screen time each got.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a really short series that was just really well made.",

In watching people interact on that level, and based on my own experiences, I found it to be very relatable for me. As of right now, I can\u2019t think of any of the main points that they didn\u2019t hit when trying to portray relationships and way we perceive them. My personal favorite was Akagi and Ryouko. For me, their relationship and development caught my eye the most and was most enjoyable to watch. I was so very, very proud of Ryouko at the end. I\u2019m sure Akagi felt the sameway. The only downside to it was hw short the episodes were, but that\u2019s kinda the point isn\u2019t it? Hopefully there will be more to come. \\n\\n\r\nWatch this, I implore you to watch this, you won\u2019t be disappointed.",

            "content": "Story:  so honestly there really isn't a story to this it just a anime where we see a bunch of students try to find love and while of course going through certain obstacles and other just that dating in tales we pretty much see the lives of dating through (im pretty sure 12 or more) people and how there relationship goes.\r\nArt: so the art is actually pretty good here they did a pretty damn good job with the character design and also the backdrops for the anime are really well done.\r\nSound: the Op is actually pretty good took me awhile to like it butdid eventually as for the Ed its decent at best but eh as for the voices i watched the dub and i gotta admit the dub is really damn good here like really good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: ill try my best review all the main character the best i can without trying to repeat it in a character. Masafumi is one of the many main male leads and well he can kinda be perv to his girlfriend asking to squeeze here boobs and stuff like that but honestly hes a pretty cool guy also his the student council president as well. Ryouko is one of the many female leads and is dating Masafumi she basically goes out with him  (to me at least) it seemed like her pressured her but in the cute and funny kind of way she is a delinquent but she has a pretty cute and shy side to her (like the many guys and girls here). Jun well he can be a shy one at that he does love the one he does but he has a hard time doing it cause she always kinda mocks it and what not but again a pretty nice guy. Yuki is the one dating Jun and well she really enjoys teasing Jun about that she loves him and stuff like that basically that's about it on here but she is a pretty nice character. Chiaki is a another lead character (MAL needs to change it from supporting to Main) be honestly really acts like a fool around his girlfriend just being a idiot but again in a fun and nice way otherwise a pretty decent character. Kana is the girlfriend to Chiaki and well them dating was kinda rocky and what not they do have a problem trying to kiss she can (like some of the girls here) be a tsundere but again a good and likeable character. Takeru is a jock if anything but you can tell that he has a really nice and acting mature to his crush and girlfriend but honestly that's really about it and well also spoiling his girlfriend but a good character. Ayaka is Takeru's girlfriend and well in the anime she is kinda needey when it comes to Takeru and what not but she has a really nice personality. Takurou is well in the soccer club and well he has a crush on the a girl (who ill mention) but otherwise he has a likeable personality. Chizuru she likes Takurou but that actually never go out (at least in the anime no idea about that manga) but she kinda is emotionless in the anime and well overtime they both start loving each other she again kinda has that emotionless personality even than she is a cool and likeable person. Kazuko is a another main (even though honestly she should be a supporting character) she is a well kinda odd one maybe she likes well ill mention him after this but honestly she i guess is a care free person in the anime. Shinichi well this guy is actually a odd one he clams to be a \"love master\" and if there is a trouble with love or something he is right there for you also he really is a odd ball for sure. Satsuki is another main (honestly again should be a supporting character) she only joined the club actually so that she could get close to her crush Hideki but otherwise she again is a pretty likeable character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Things that i liked: honestly almost everything about this from the comedy just being laugh out loud funny from me liking all the characters here and also the fact that some of the go out in the start middle or actually don't even go out at all the kinda is neat in a sense. Things that i didn't like: i mean i didn't like that this was a 12min running anime that is honestly the only thing i can really think of that i didn't care for in this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Im goona give this a 8.5 (was trying to think of a 8 or 9 but in the end gave it a 9) this anime is freaking funny as hell and also that i loved all the characters in this and also that the anime was damn enjoyable as well easily a anime that is worth the watch for sure.",

            "content": "I don't care who you are, you enjoy rom-coms as much as the next weeb down the line. What this anime does is takes the important bits of an average rom-com, and shortens it down into small, comedic bits that are easily digestible for anybody watching.\r\nAlso, we need more short comedy anime series like this. They're (in my opinion) the most enjoyable anime series to watch, since there is usually no plot heavy story, its comedy (obviously), and it only takes 12 minutes, so you can watch it if you only have a small bit of time to kill.\r\nOnto the real review!!\r\nStory - 8\r\nDespite thecreators having to stuff the stories of multiple individual couples into 3-4 minute bits, they really did a good job with it. They made easily rememberable situations, and had the characters interact with each other brilliantly.\\n\r\nI really wish we could have seen more of the love stories though, I wish it would have been 24 episodes instead of 12 ):\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\r\nThe art wasn't anything too special in my eyes, it was pretty average. There isn't much to say about it, since there wasn't anything extremely great, or terrible.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\r\nLike most series, I never stop to listen to the sound, so I can't comment on it. My surplus of \"There isn't much to say\" won't be leaking out in this review anymore, so enjoy it while it lasts.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nYou know how sometimes you can take one look at a character and immediately know what they will be like? After watching the OP in episode 1, I knew how the majority of the relationships would be. And God, was I wrong! It was better than what I had expected! I really enjoyed seeing characters with unique personalities interacting with each other, instead of cardboard cutouts being desperate over each other.\\n\r\nI'll be honest, I don't remember a single one of their names (Would you expect me to? Going through Danganronpa is hard enough for names). However, I did give them some nice nicknames! Here is my list :\\n\r\nRyouko - Fluffy Delinquent\\n\r\nShinichi - Happy Usui Takumi\\n\r\nYuki - Droopy Face\\n\r\nTakao - Female Tsu-chan\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nThis has to be one of my favorite anime series, I'm glad I took a break from watching Isekai anime to watch this gem. I have a really soft and weak spot for Romance anime, and I like humor (since I'm not dead), put that along with short and easy to watch episodes and you get a big fat like from me!\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\r\nFrom now on, I'm going to recommend this to people who are either new to anime, or don't have anything to watch. It was a really enjoyable experience for me, this actually put me in a really good mood (I type as my face is the most dull thing in existence).\\n\\n\r\nInsert clever and fleshed out ending here\\n",

            "content": "Highschool love. \r\nOne of the most prominent element there is, especially in the anime highschool world. What better than to watch these multiple love stories slowly unfold as the character struggle with getting their feelings across to one another.\r\n\u203b Strength \u203b\r\n- Interconnected. I enjoy how each character has a background love story and how they have their own mission to fulfill. Not only that, each character affects one another in some way or another and that interconnection makes it much more realistic.\r\n- Relationship. Every relationship is different. People are different from one and another and when two people connect romantically, you are bound to seecharacters struggle in their own ways to get their feelings across. This anime depict all types of relationship that one might have seen or even experience.\\n\r\n- Feelings. What I feel and what I want are two different entity. A lot of these characters want something out of their partners -- similar to reality. And the struggles that these characters went through makes it much more realistic.\\n\r\n- Enjoyable. This was definitely a light anime to enjoy as I could also imagine this anime go for a completely different route: psychological, dark, drama and so on. \\n\r\n- Favorites. Obviously you are going to have favorites in this. Which ship shall you board and which ship you want to see finally get sailed. And making viewers ship is definitely a bonus.\\n\\n\r\n\u203b Weakness \u203b\\n\r\n- Time. This is a more of a personal pet peeve but each character's love story are not all created equal. Some get more screen time than others as that may cause some disagreement amongsts the audience in terms of fairness. \\n\r\n- Questionable actions. This might be more of a cultural perspective since in the Western Culture, being so wishy-washy and shy about confessing isn't commonly seen or heard. It makes you think. Are confessions in Japan mostly like this or is it overly exaggerated for the sake of entertainment?\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this to a fellow weeb? Hell yeah.\\n\r\nWould I watch this again? I plan to already, skipping time to see my favorite ships slowly blossom once again.\\n\r\nDo I want a season 2? I pray that it'll happen!\\n\\n\r\nThis was definitely an enjoyable rom-com anime to watch and I would, without a doubt, rewatch it with fellow weebs and non-weeb friends. Definitely recommend 11/10, especially if you are a sucker for romance like me.",

            "content": "Tsurezure Children, the title itself makes it sound like these kids are starting to grow up and learn what's it like to be a couple, at least that's what I thought when I joined the train. As I expected, it's how it was going to be.\r\nI felt so happy to know that to this present day, there is some form of originality taking place within shows like this. It's main genre is comedy, and it makes me want to watch them all over again with tears of joy before I go back to watch anime that are ignorant. I can't easily explain something like thisbeing raw, the characters and their dialogue is what carried the show, and without that formula, it would be lost within the history of anime I have watched. \\n\\n\r\nComedy with this anime, in my opinion, has a perfect score. Now considering that they use comedy in every sub plot can be quite challenging, and there is about over 6 sub plots that I can't exactly explain every single one again without going back to watch all of them a few times more. It's not like they are forgettable moments, you can watch something that you enjoy, but every detail can't be recorded in your head. I can point out that a few scenes are not so funny, so why have it a perfect score when a few scenes aren't so great? Well, you can't run into an anime like this that has at least 3/4 of an episode that is hilarious to watch.\\n\r\nI'm not going to spoil the jokes, it's up to you if you think the jokes are funny or not.\\n\\n\r\nMy Complaints about this is that there are way, WAY too many characters to keep track of. Some of them are easy to remember, some of them you forget they already existed, some characters you didn't realize they are different characters, and finally some you ought to enjoy more out of. I have at least 3 sub plots that I can find quite memorable that only involves with a total of 6 characters, although there are other ones that I find funny to watch, but they are either not my favorites, or I didn't mind much. \\n\\n\r\nSo here are the 3 sub-plots I will describe in one sentence. A couple that are beginners with a relationship, one being unaware how to be a boyfriend role model, while the other is unsure how she can keep together a relationship. A couple that starts with a delinquent girl doing bad activities, but is stopped by the class president and decided to be in a relationship with her and help her study for a better education. Finally, a boy trying to reveal his crush to the girl in his dreams, but the girl seemed not interested in romance because she has no experience with it whatsoever, but later she starts to grow interest with the boy. Now these sub-plots just sound short, simple, and sweet, but it's the comedy that really pays off and helps build to love them. \\n\\n\r\nI had a good run with this season, but I am expecting and hoping to see a season 2 of this show, I don't mind if it takes more than 2 years to make this, as along as it gets a continuation, that's all I ask for this. \\n\\n\r\n8/10, need to make the number 10 lower because it's too many numbers for the show.\\n\\n\\n",

Not every couple or future couple are having thesame problem. A couple is officially presented as a couple, but they don't know how couples behave, another couple is conformed by 2 childhood friends that gets pretty hard for them to take the next step, even though both of them want to, another couple both of them love each other, but neither of them knows the other one loves them, another couple both love each other, but they're too embarassed to admit it, and I believe that's just the half of the couples presented on this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI like the fact that they present a classroom by the couples, and then by whole.

OH THAT'S WORKING SO PERFECTLY .And there are 3-4 anime like this in the season you know there is a saying ''there are no shortcuts for success'' if you wanna make something good , memorable and enjoyable you gotta go all the way this is just unacceptable .",

Since there is no one single narrative and the storylines weren't continuing back to back and all the things were happening pretty much simultanously, it wasn't distracting. Each episode consist of few mini episodes following different pair with different kind of relationship and relationship issues. This feels fresh and especially since these relationship and some of the characters felt that could happen and be based in IRL. Of course since this is a comedy and a great one at that there were some over the top and very comical charactersthat were enjoyable and funny. \\n\\n\r\nArt style was fine and sound at the same level but that is not the main point, it is the relationships and the characters that you actually could relate to, at least one of them and their relationship or their problems. At least I did. There was these issues that I also had and looking back to those moments with this anime made those things look comical, since back then they were so huge deal.\\n\\n\r\nI really can recommend this anime and it is one of the top animes this season has to offer. I give it 8,2/10 rounded to 8, for being such a good and different romcom.",

A short love story that begins with \"I love you\" from the very start.\r\nTsurezure Children depicts various types of short love stories in a light heart way, it's never taken itself seriously, yet its romance is more believable than your typical anime romance. And that is the charm of it. What contributed to this is probably the screen time it dedicates to each couple as well as the amount of development they receive throughout those small screen time. The love develops in a cute and funny way andthey also don't hold back or drag the development just for the sake of repeating the same joke. This makes this anime really refreshing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThere a lot of couples that I think I won't be able to recall all of them but each of them is extremely cute in their own way. They consist of different type of personality and mix together in a very natural way. For instance, that student council-boy and the blonde-bad-girl. I find their relationship to be extremely cute, maybe it because how their personality balances each other so well.\\n\\n\r\nOk, I don't want to make this too long since the anime is also short. In overall, it is a short, relaxed, cute, funny and refreshing love story that didn't drag itself like a stereotype romance you typically see out there. Give it a try if you want to find something short and cute and straightforward to watch.",

            "content": "Hey, an anime short romance that actually does the entire \"misunderstandings schtick\" and NOT get annoying!\r\nLA can be really cynical when it comes to romance but LA can open up at times and Tsurezure Children definitely resonated with LA...more on the lines of \"LA wished something would have happened to LA in high school\".\r\nTsurezure Children shows vignettes of many different relationships in an unnamed school, from a comedic best friend turned girlfriend and boyfriend, a love at first sight romance, the shy guy and girl coming together and heck even the delinquent tsundere with a quirky teasing smartass.\r\nLet's start with Yuki Minagawa voiced by KanaHanazawa who likes to romantically tease Jun Furuya voiced by Kyohei Amasaki in which he has a doting little sister Hotaru Furuya voiced by Haruka Tomatsu who makes some of the best reactions in the anime short. Yuki's teasing is one of the best things about this relationship as she knows ways to get reactions from the Furuya siblings and she is the catalyst to their skits and LA just loves it. LA's most interested relationship would be Masafumi Akagi voiced by Kensho Ono and Ryouko Kaji voiced by Ayane Sakura as their comedic timing and Akagi's teasing are well timed although LA felt he got a bit too far at times. Ayaka Kamine voiced by Yui Ogura and Takeru Gouda voiced by Tomoaki Maeno although their relationship grows in which Ayaka is the one that pushes it while Takeru once to take it slow was kinda ok in LA's opinion and not the most interesting relationship for LA, though Ayaka got better for LA, trying to push their relationship and showing that she's more than a shy girl archetype. Takurou Sugawara voiced by Kaito Ishikawa and Chizuru Takano voiced by Inori Minase has the entire love at first sight romance and like Ayaka and Takeru's relationship was less interesting for LA, heck probably was LA's least interesting relationship the anime looked at but thankfully their relationship got better by the end of it. Kana Ijima voiced by Akari Kito and Chiaki Uchimura voiced by Seiichirou Yamashita are the \"misunderstandings\" relationships and really what works in this entire comedic timing and misunderstandings is that for the MOST part, their misunderstandings comes from outside sources that causes their misunderstandings and seeing BOTH sides of their misunderstandings, thus it both cancels any chance of these characters from being idiots and allows for great comedic timing and by the end of it, LA ROOTED for these two to be together because fate or awkward situations just had to crash their party. FINALLY, the only other relationship LA needs to look at were Takao Yamane voiced by Hiro Shinono and Chiyo Kurihara, the two twice shy characters however LA really didn't like Takao stopping Chiyo's advances and keeps railroading himself and self depreciative nature caused LA to get really annoyed with him.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation by Studio Gokumi were for the most part decent though some of the facial animation got derped at times but LA can give the animation some grace as the animation wasn't the most important focus in this anime short. Still Studio Gokumi did what they are known for in making moe character designs and still was consistent at that (aside from the occasional derps).\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, well there are THREE voice actors LA would praise in this anime short. Ayane Sakura, Haruka Tomatsu and Kana Hanazawa. Ayane Sakura took LA's favourite voice actor for this anime short, if not because of her adorable tsundere (mainly leaning on her dere) vocals, Haruka Tomatsu for doing her crazed doting little sister scthick and made amazing chemistry with Kana Hanazawa all the more better and Kana Hanazawa's teasing vocals were great for her aforementioned great chemistry with Haruka Tomatsu.\\n\\n\r\nIf anything Tsurezure Children was LA's most surprising anime short and heck anime for Summer 2017 to the point of LA giving Tsurezure Children the best romance for Summer 2017. If you wanna see a misunderstanding romance that ISN'T annoying to various romances with a ton of comedy, leaps and bounds, trials and tribulations to them then Tsurezure Children is a definite watch.",

At first I was worried that sense there are multiple couples in the show that some of the relationships would be underwhelming compared to others, or that some wouldn't be as fleshed out. Boy was I wrong! Somehow they made all of the characters really likable, and all of the relationships are pretty fleshed out. \r\nThe best part is how they are able to explore so many different sides to love and what it's like to be in your first relationship. Tsurezure Children isn't afraid to talk about subgects that most shows are afraid to take about. This showis just so gosh darn relatable! I also like how Tsurezure Children makes fun a lot of the more cringe worthy sides of young love and makes it so that you are able to laugh at moments that would be really embarrassing in real life. \\n\\n\r\nThey also have some more emotional senses in this show that are very good. I also love how all of the Japanese voice actors preform there roles so perfectly! I have also heard that the dub is pretty good too. The only bad thing I really have to say about this show is that the art isn't very good compared to other shows that have came out this season. Though I'm not surprised sense it's a short anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Tsurezure Children is a very good RomCom that I highly recommend. Somehow this short series is better then some RomComs that have way more time to flesh out there characters and what not. Tsurezure Children is definitely one of the better shows from this season.",

This series is like a god-sent compilation of my favourite scenes types to watch. It's also quite silly and exciting because it switches gears and tones so quickly.

            "content": "I'm always skeptical whenever I see a short-form anime I'm interested in on the seasonal charts, and I'm never sure how fair that is to the anime. Oftentimes, I find myself questioning the motives of the anime studio when they decide to make half-episodes. Do they have a low budget? Do they have no confidence in their show and are trying to cut costs? Oftentimes, the terrible shorts I've seen spring to mind when I've seen probably just as many good short-form anime as I have bad ones. (Let the record show that I scored an anime with 4-minute episodes a 10.) That's why I'mso thankful that I decided to give Tsurezure Children a shot - it has become the anime I look forward to most each week throughout the Summer 2017 season.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, the story, or rather STORIES, are very basic. Various high school couples stumble their way through relationships to comedic effect, but it's the way in which the stories are told that makes Tsurezure rise towards the top of the RomCom genre.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two things that make such a basic premise stick when other similar anime have fallen forgotten by the wayside. First, each individual story in an episode is incredibly short. There are usually three 4-minute stories per episode. This works because Tsurezure pitches its tent firmly in the RomCom camp of relationship anime, and we're never given too much time for the comedy of each relationship to become familiar and therefore stale. Some relationships are dropped and then brought up again weeks later so that we can refamiliarize ourselves with their brand of comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe other reason this anime just works is because of the empathy the characters naturally invoke. Tsurezure focuses on the awkward feeling out of relationships all of us have gone through at one point or another and by focusing on ONLY that aspect of relationships, sans some of the heavier drama that other RomCom anime like to include, it feels like an anime that knows what it wants and what it doesn't. Instead of backstory exposition dumps, we walk through these relationships WITH the characters and everything we know about their personalities and insecurities is because of what they SHOW us. These characters are #relatable incarnate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, I wouldn't call Tsurezure Children a masterpiece. The art can be janky at times. (Their blush marks extend past the end of their faces. How the hell does that even work??) But the highest compliment I can give it is that it's fun. It's fun, and it's ssooo much better than I thought it would be.",

            "content": "Tsurezure Children is another addition to the \"short but sweet rom com\" shows like Rainbow Days and even the Chinese \"Aishen qiaokeli.\" It focuses on fast pacing without the drama and buildup of a relationship. In a sentence, it's progression that's so quick that it spares readers the buildup to how the relationship truly began, or sometimes cuts and crunches that into a very dense and short bit.\r\nTo put it simply: it works pretty well, but it's not perfect.\r\nBefore I get any further, I suppose you should know the basic premise of Tsurezure Children. Each episodes focuses on 4 3-minute clips of different couples andtheir progression in their relationships. There are a TON of couples, and the producers did not spare the love triangles or typical tropes in some characters either.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's appreciated for a guy like me is the step away from the typical tropes of tsundere, kuudere, and dandere. The characters feel very human, and while each one can be slapped with any of those three labels (sorry, no yanderes here), they contain enough of a uniqueness to their personality to not make you roll your eyes and feel annoyed. This especially helps the show, as you notice the characters developing based off their chemistry with each other, as well as find out more about each character as their personalities develop. One example is a couple that tries to move to the \"next stage\" in their relationship (physically), but struggle to get the ball moving. As a result, they utilize their longtime friendship beforehand to soften the mood and make the transition easier. These sorts of moments are unquestionably goofy but also comedic and cute. You can see the desire for the characters to grow for one another, and it helps you understand them more.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, some couples lack development, especially in terms of the why or how they came to develop feelings for one another. Some of these hurt Tsurezure immensely, as searching for the \"reason\" or the \"how\" simply makes you fail to find one. I'm not talking \"they skipped over it because the two are at the 'let's go out' stage,\" I'm talking \"one asks why the other likes her and the other guy doesn't give a reason that feels legitimate or real.\" I understand that rom com anime can be otherwise deprived of logic, but these sorts of holes really hurt the chemistry that unfolds onscreen for me.\\n\\n\r\nI'll quickly touch on art and sound here. The opening is catchy, and definitely not bad. Same with the ending. The music is generally placed at good timings, and there wasn't a moment where I felt \"Now if only they had some sort of sad song playing here,\" because the song they played fit the mood. Because of the shortness of the actual series, they overlap the ending track and credits with the ending of the episode, and so far they have yet to fail this approach. The producers aren't combining the mellowness of the ending with a comedy bit, so that's a good strategy to fit in their screentime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd love to see how these relationships develop by the end before giving my final say. I generally give higher rating, so I'd say this might also be an 8 in your books. It's an enjoyable shift away from both the countless harem anime out there and the single couple shoujo style; you have a balance here of multiple couples, and the biggest issue is if you want to see a slow developing romance, or if you just can't keep up with this many couples, and forget who's who.\\n\\n\r\nLong story short, if you like to see quick development of characters, some pretty strong interactions and developments, as well as a short and sweet show, this baby's for you. If you're looking for a slow development between one boy and one girl, go find Tsuki Ga Kirei or something. If you want a harem over this well done anime, it better be a good one.",

Throughout this show you will experience a bunch ofshort romance skits where the characters are put into awkward situations with each other.I can pretty much grantee this show will make you laugh and feel good inside. A lot of these skits are very relatable as well which adds more to the entertainment and laugh factor.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all if you would like to see some funny romance skits that will make you laugh, you should check this out.

It's short, give it a try.\r\n_______________\r\nThere's really not much to say about this anime.\r\nThere is not the typical main character (or 2 mcs) which the show focuses on. Instead, there is a whole lot of them, which allows this anime to show many different situations on how relationships & love can play out. Some are just cute together, others are more pushy, or both sides are too shy to ever make a move. Every character shown has its very own personality, which makes every single couple introduced unique in their way, and all ofthem are really well done. \\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I rate this with \"only\" 8 instead of a full 10 is because I feel it was -too- short. It's already only 12 episodes, and the episodes are only half the length of usual anime episodes (12 min), making the whole show not even 2 and a half hours.. while exploring like 10 different relationships. They made really well use of the time, but I would've appreciated it if one would see more of each couple.",

The story on this one is really just a few mini segments here and there of different characters trying to hook up, but in an entertaining fashion. Honestly this entire anime is all about high school crushes trying to get together. There will be tears, there will be fights, and there will be fun. \r\nI think they really did a good job creating an environment of characters that feels genuine. As many of the scenarios in this anime are pretty realistic, aside from your sometimes generic\"tsundere\" or \"dandere\" moments. \\n\\n\r\nArt and sound are pretty good - - nothing special. The OP is pretty good, too. Kinda gets stuck in your head, but nothing too drastic. Art is different, here. Different, but interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime only runs twelve minutes each episode, with a total of only twelve episodes; so not much to go off of. But it's a good rendition of how high school can sometimes be; albeit a bit dramatic at times. I'd say give this one a watch, but really don't expect too much. It's definitely entertaining, though.",

            "content": "(the final volume for the source material should be out sometime this Summer - it's a good time to read the series if you hadn't already. And please, ditch this mess) \r\nTo simplify the issue: they removed half the cast through-out the series solely to focus on four couples - but in doing so, it removed 3/4 of what made \"Tsurezure Children\" so good in the first place. \r\nAnd then BEYOND that, they chopped up scenes and mostly reorganized them so that the pacing was trash and ... wait, why is it only focused on two couples now? Wasn't it supposed to be four? Weren'tthere tidbits of a few other couples? What?? \\n\\n\\n\r\n-- \\n\\n\r\nSTORY (7/10) \\n\r\nThe source material is nearly-flawless, if not completely so. If you want to actually enjoy this series - you REALLY have to go and read it. And then you might as well treat this adaption as a plague because, really, it was given so much to work with ... and then ignored everything that could've made this bearable. I'd far prefer a lower art score than a truly well-written series get treated as trash. \\n\r\nOh, yeah, the reason it's a 7 is because they DIDN'T ADD ANYTHING to the story. They chopped it up horribly and glued them back in an inconsistent mess; minus 2/4 couples the opted to keep (Chiaki/Kana, Sugayan/Takano). If I didn't know the actual story from the source material, this series would have a story grade of 2/10. Because, yeah, no. No. \\n\\n\\n\r\nART (5/10) \\n\r\nTo be honest, I'm mostly biased because I dislike this overly-bright art style. It's not very fun to watch animated. But it was mostly consistent so that was nice. But, nah. Quite boring to look at. And very distracting without much shade variety. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (5/10) \\n\r\nIt... was noticeably a poor budget. Half the reason I suspect they chopped half the series out was because they couldn't afford a larger cast. Which I can get, but it still sucks they didn't instead lower the art quality some for the broadcast so they could've tried doing a better job. \\n\r\nBut yeah, the music and sfx were fine. Basic, but fine. Main issue was the mics - some lines were clearly said so low they came with static, some were so painfully close to the mic that it never sounded realistic, and even one line I recall was shouted so well that the (tiny) room's reverb was louder than the lines themselves. So it got distracting there, but the team DID choose good VAs for the roles they (eventually) animated. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (10/10) \\n\r\nTHIS IS IN NO WAY THANKS TO THE ANIME ADAPTION TEAM - THE WRITERS HAVE NO PART IN THIS BECAUSE OTHER THAN CHOPPING THINGS UP TO HAVE A LACKLUSTER ADAPTION, =THEY= DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. \\n\r\nAGAIN: READ THE ACTUAL SOURCE MATERIAL BECAUSE THIS ADAPTION RUINED EVERYTHING SO GOOD ABOUT IT. \\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (2/10) \\n\r\nI'm being UNREASONABLY generous here. I... really couldn't enjoy it. They chose great voice actors, but the fact they removed so much of the source material for this... and then pretended they didn't do as such in the first and final episode... yeah, no. I don't trust this team. I feel personally attacked from watching this mess. \\n\\n\r\n-- \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (3/10) \\n\r\nScrew it - just avoid this series if you're able to read the comic. Everything that makes this series so good is hardly transferred into this adaption. Which is a shame BECAUSE THIS ADAPTION DIDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT CUT THINGS OUT. Oh, and they paced things horribly 'cause I guess they didn't know wtf direction to take this; should they include more cast, or include only the four couples? Short answer: I regret them making adapting this. \\n\\n\r\n--- \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Ditch this adaption because nothing worth watching it for was included. Unless you absolutely only liked the source material for Chiaki/Kana and Sugayan/Takano. Then by all means, feel free to rate this 10/10 loll",

Despite that, here's my review:\r\nWhen I first started watching this, I thought, oh maybe this one won't be as painful as all the others since it's only 12 minutes per episode.  Oh, boy was I right, and not because it was only 12 minutes per episode but because it seemed decent. The first episode is where most of the characters are presented. \r\nThe second episode, damn, I'm actually liking this so far.\\n\\n\r\nLittle did I know, I'd finish the whole anime in under 2 hours and a half.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what can I say? It was pretty decent. Despite some cockblocking, irritating characters and slightly useless events, it was actually okay. It's not something that I'll remember for much longer but for what it's worth, it's a good watch. Now, hopefully, they make a season two so that this continues but I can't have high hopes for that as lots of anime's second seasons are... not always the best.\\n\\n\r\nTime to talk about the 'damn dude they did this right' and faults of this particular anime:\\n\\n\r\nStory: It was alright, with sparse background information, it didn't get too annoying. Nobody seemed to have any tragic backgrounds which is something that I needed from these past few anime that I've seen. It was all happy and cheerful. While there honestly isn't that much story, there's a lot of character development, something that most anime doesn't have enough of.\\n\\n\r\nArt: In my honest opinion, it was good. Awesome in fact. I love this style of anime and whenever there's an anime that isn't styled like this, it's somewhat hard to watch for me. Everything looked beautiful and realistic. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Satisfactory but not prominent. Voice acting was fine along with the lip syncing which I guess is expected these days. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Besides the few irritating characters, the characters were bearable. They didn't want always want me to rip my eyes out, put them in a plastic bag, fill it up with water and smash the bag with a hammer. Wow. Some of the characters were shy, some loud, and some obnoxious but they all seemed to fit. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: It was good. I will never re-watch this but that's just because when I rewatch things, they tend to be, how do I say, not as good as the first time. Hopefully, a season two comes soon so I can watch more!\\n\\n",

Probably you have came across many of the situations told in the entire series, the first love, the nerviousness of telling your beloved what you feel, the discomfort when you try to give your first kiss and so on.\r\nIfyou want to get some fun you should probably give it a shot, if you are looking for an anime with a good story to tell this is not the one you've been looking for. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, I give it a 5, but it doesn't mean it's not worth being watched.

Whilst the art/animation may not have been anything out of the ordinary (although nicely done for the most part), and the sound couldn\u2019t exactly be called spectacular (though the opening and ending were catchy and sweet), overall I scored this series pretty highly. \r\nWhy? Because I enjoyed it. It made me smile. \r\nAlmost every single character trope known to the rom-com genre was used in this anime \u2013 I don\u2019t think anything in this anime was actually meant to be original - but done in manageable amounts. Aseach short in the series was only a few minutes long, every time I would start to think \u2018okay, I\u2019m getting a bit bored of these characters\u2019 the story would end and a different couple would take their place. The downside to this was that I didn\u2019t always get to see as much of my favourites as I would have liked, but it wasn\u2019t exactly a terrible sacrifice when it made the series so much better as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s true that there wasn\u2019t much of a plot, but there wasn\u2019t meant to be: the entire focus of the show was on the characters\u2019 interactions with one another and subsequent development. Each couple and the relationship between them was developed at a different speed; some progressed in their relationship early on, some kept encountering difficulties, and one couple\u2019s relationship even regressed. But this was all part of what kept the show entertaining. It just highlighted the differences between all the characters and kept things fresh. \\n\\n\r\nI actually liked most (if not all) of the characters. I liked seeing them struggling in their everyday lives, and even found some of them really relatable. The romantic moments kept me cheering for their successes too \u2013 unlike in most rom-coms, I wanted every single pairing here to succeed. \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n\r\nAnd everything was pretty light-hearted, even in the dramatic parts \u2013 there were no serious tear-jerking moments or complicated love triangles or anything like that. (This anime is a comedy, after all). It\u2019s an anime that you\u2019d watch for fun, and have fun watching.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely recommended for fans of the rom-com genre, or for people who just want something short, light-hearted and entertaining.

            "content": "This is a light anime that you can watch for fun. \r\nThe story isn't too complicated nor too shoujo-likish or moe-likish, the best thing about it is that it's simple. \r\nWhat I liked most about it is that it doesn't depict the \"having a crush\" thing in the exaggerated stereotyped way, there are certain couples, or people who have crushes who get hurt, or who take time to fully understand each other. It also shows how that \"perfect harmony\", regardless of the way you might interpret it, gets built over time, and that applies for the understanding that comes between the two partners, what's morenice is that the creators added a bit of amazing funny moments every now and then. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a very enjoyable anime, and I recommend it for whomever feels saturated by the most \"attractive\" anime styles or by anything else related directly or not to this, this will help improve, even slightly, your mood. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI hope this has been helpful.",

            "content": "Tsurezure Children provides a nice rom-com fix in the way of some quick scenarios between high school kids. I thought it was nice to see how the awkward romance unfolded, in most cases it resulted in some hilarious moments.\r\nConsidering the length of the anime, a strong story is not to be expected. However, the way the setting of the story progresses steadily from week to week is great and by the end of the season, there is a sense of inter-connectivity between the characters in the high school. There is a diverse set of characters and couples and because of this, it's very easy tofind characters with which one can connect with. The anime has a nice art style and the animation is what I would expect from this type of show.\\n\r\nTsurezure Children is a quick, easily digestible and fun romance series that was a pleasure to watch and hopefully it gets more seasons in the future.",
