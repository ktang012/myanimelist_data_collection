            "content": "What can we expect from a title that says Romeo x Juliet? Probably a cheesy and draggy remade version of the original story that has no dept whatsoever. \r\nBut I was utterly wrong. Simply bear in mind that this is the Anime Version of Romeo and Juliet, and expect what you'll expect from most anime for eg, fantasy. I'm no fan of Shakespear's work but I do know the general outline of the story and the important scenes such as the balcony which audience will get to enjoy during the course of the series (although I'm guilty of laughing at that part). \r\nStory wise -Firstly, I'm very impressed by the various climax and exciting moments in this series. The first 10 episodes or so will keep you on your toes while tugging your emotions along with the sweet and tragic moments of our main characters. Following episodes then mellow down, and just when I thought it's gonna get boring here forth the story picks up again and you just have to keep watching. ie. damn high priority. However, you may find yourself with a big &quot;huh?!&quot; at the last few eps. Yes there's where the Fantasy kicks in although if you have watched enough anime, you'll know that this is a typical storyline and thus befitting for this series as well. In general, the story was well remade for an anime indeed.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The style may be a little hard to stomach for some but fret not, you'll get used to it in 1 or 2 episodes' time. The background was beautiful in some scenes especially the extensive flower beds. In fact, during the course of watching this series, I actually felt that it's well drawn because the characters doesn't have oversized eyes (or boobs) or overly skinny limbs, unlike some other animes.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Needless to say, the opening is one where you'll keep listening to even after completing the series. Images from the anime will then naturally float into your mind. Yes that's how influential Lena Park's version of You Raise Me Up is.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - For this portion, I'll really have to give the director a big hug. Setting the side characters aside, the mental development of both our hero and heroine was well-balanced and developed. The romance between the 2 was nicely presented while slowly telling the audience how they fell in love. This part was absolutely perfect because a plain love-at-first-sight thing would cause the story to lose its meaning and turn me off quickly.\\n\\n\r\nDespite it being a great anime, I've gotta admit the presence of my fan-girling moments during the exceptionally sweet and touching moments which were strewed here and there. So fellow babes, watch this to ignite the shoujo heart in you!",

            "content": "Going into this series, I admit that I had braced myself for more of a tragedy than this.  Having acted in the original play, I know just how depressing and plain ol' emo it can be.  But this is truly something different.\r\nStory:  First off, the story is much more moving and uplifting than I was expecting.  There were times when I was actually moved to tears by the responses of characters to each other.  The story just barely follows Shakespeare's original story.  Basically put, if you're looking for an anime rendition of his story, you're looking in the wrongplace.  This is not to say that the story is bad in any sense of the word.  Rather, I think that Shakespeare would be proud of this expansion to his original story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  I'd have to say that the art section is the most disappointing of all.  Thankfully, this isn't saying too much.  The art from front to back is very well done.  Some of the townsfolk felt a little bit cheapened but I would count this as making sure the story is focused on who it should be.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  I have to admit, I'm extremely impressed with the sound from this anime.  From the musical compositions to the sound effects to the voice acting to one of the better renditions of &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; (performed by Lena Park).  As far as audio goes, darn impressive.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Only a couple of characters weren't all that impressive.  However, all of the key players are very well developed.  All of the seiyuu who performed did an excellent job indeed.  This really helped to bring out the characters personalities and brought life.",

            "content": "Title: Romeo x Juliet\r\nManga, Anime: Romeo x Juliet does have a manga spinoff, with art done by COM and story still done by Gonzo and Sky Perfect Well think, that began running in Kadokawa Shoten's Monthly Asuka on March 24th, 2007.  It is still running at this point in time, and has yet to be licensed Stateside.\r\nRomeo x Juliet is a twenty-four episode anime that was produced by Gonzo (famous for their work on Gankutsuou and Saikano) and directed by Fumitoshi Oisaki (this was his first major work as a director).  It ran from April 4th to September 26th, 2007 on Japanese TV,and, contrary to Funimation's giving subbers a cease and desist (which was on supposedly on behalf of Gonzo's requests for them to enforce Japanese copyright laws), the anime has NOT been licensed Stateside.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fourteen years ago, on the floating continent of Neo-Verona, the Montagues led a coup against the Capulets, and slaughtered the entire family, except for a young girl and her servant.  The girl, in the meantime, has been bought up as a boy, Odin, and kept in hiding, occasionally going out as the masked vigilante the Red whirlwind.  On the day of her sixteenth birthday, the day when her true identity is to be revealed, she meets Romeo, the son of the Montagues...\\n\\n\r\nAs you can tell, this is an EXTREMELY loose adaptation of the story.  And, honestly, it had the chance to be good.  However, the story has issues, and lots of them.  And to cover them requires some SPOILERS, so read ahead at your own risk\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all centers in the adaptation of the story.  It's absolutely bare-bones: two star-crossed lover from rival families who die. I'm not a Shakespeare purist at all, but dear GOD, they fucked a lot up.  They can't decide when to use Shakespearean dialogue or when to adapt it, or when to keep scenes from the original play in just to remind people that yes, this is an adaptation.  And for the recored, they fucked up the balcony scene in the extreme.  I'm sorry, but you have to be really trying with a vengance to mess it up.\\n\\n\r\nAnother major problem in this is the characters.  Gonzo might have been able to pull this off if they'd kept the original personalities from Shakespeare.  Instead, Romeo becomes a naive whiny little brat who waxes philosophically (and unconvincingly) about justice and freedom and peace once he is sent to work in the mines by his father (Maoist China, plz?), Juliet can't decide whether she wants to be a shoujo heroine destined to lead a revolution and avenge her parents or a whiny little Mary-Sue moping over her angsty past and her TRU WUV with Romeo, not to mention that she's supposedly uber-skilled with a sword, but makes incredibly stupid beginners mistakes at several critical times, and Tybalt, probably my favorite out of the whole lot, is dark and brooding and actually doesn't coddle Juliet, unlike most of the cast.  Other characters from other Shakespeare plays are thrown in haphazardly, but don't hold your breath waiting for them to be like in other plays; they're all butchered versions of their former selves (like most everyone else from the original Romeo and Juliet), most of whom are fawning over and coddling either Romeo or Juliet or both.  Background stories for some major characters (such as Tybalt and the generic evil tyrant Montague) don't come until later in the series, and when they do, it's just more WTF (Montague is a son of the Capulets and got adopted into the Montagues and backstabbed his way to the top in order to get his revenge on the Capulets for mistreating his mother, who was, in fact, a whore; and Tybalt is apparently the son of Montague and a Capulet woman - again, WTF?!)  The biggest issue with characters is the fact that NONE of them get any development; they're all one-note personalities running around in circles for most of the series.  \\n\\n\r\nThis, in turn, is compounded by the issue that, for most of the series, THERE IS NO PLOT.  It's either Juliet running around with Romeo in puppy love, angsting, or attempting to lead a revolution but failing at swordfighting when she's supposedly amazing at it, while Romeo either runs around with Juliet, tries to kindly let down his arranged fiancee, or starts to realize just what a douche his father is.  Gonzo tries to build the series on Romeo and Juliet's TRU WUV, but the most that it is is puppy love, as they never meet for anything more than six minutes, yet this is enough for them to decide to run away together about halfway through the series and marry each other and set up house in a pastoral village out in the middle of nowhere.  (...Then again, it was kind of like this in the original play, so they got that aspect down, to some degree.)  They get captured, though, and Romeo goes off to the mines to have a slight development arc that makes him even more annoying at the end of it, and Juliet goes off to finally lead that revolution (which is instigated by something so fucking EASY that it's a wonder they didn't try this years ago, let alone the other five times that the revolution failed in this series!).  And when the revolution comes about, it's glossed over to make room for the random tree that apparently keeps Neo Verona in the sky and that is dying because of the Montagues, and apparently Juliet is the next sacrifice to keep it alive.  This brings about the situation in the last two episodes that I bought up back in the third paragraph.  To say the least, this thing is a fucking MESS.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the whole story is made of FAIL.  There are bits of redemption that come through in Tybalt here and there, but all in all, this was just made of suck.  And you wonder where it comes from, because on the one hand, you've got stuff like Saikano, and Bokurano, and Gankutsuou (which was an EXCELLENT adaptation), and then on the other, you've got THIS.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Neo-Verona is absolutely beautiful.  Gonzo really tried to emulate classical Italian Renaissance architecture in its construction, and they did it well.  The winged horses that show up here and there in the series are pretty neatly designed and executed as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs could've been done better, I think.  Most everyone in this show looks pretty generic -- well-animated, for the most part, but fairly generic.  And there are times when it was pretty obvious that they were trying to save budget with pan shots, still frames, and glossing over fight scenes.  The animation quality dropped every once in a while, too.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: The background music for this was a study in extremes: it was either melodramatic or overdramatic string orchestra, to match the \"epic\" fight scenes and \"dramatic\" revelations, or soft and gentle string and piano numbers, to match the \"tender\" moments and the angst.  All in all, it took the suckiness to whole new places.\\n\\n\r\nThe two versions of the OP and its instrumental, a cover of Josh Groban's \"You Raise Me Up\" by Lena Park, were used at several points in the series, and even if I didn't really like where it was used, I liked the songs themselves.  The first ED, \"Cyclone\" by 12012, was a pretty nice rock piece as well.  I didn't like the second ED all that much, as it was another female emo ballad, which we kind of already had in the OP.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu: Overall, the seiyuu for this did a good job in portraying their characters, even if I hated their characters' guts.  Props especially to Tybalt and Montague's seiyuu, who pitched their voices so that they matched, something I didn't recognize till I saw them in scenes that happened one right after the other, which was a hint to a major (if slightly WTF-ish) plot point.\\n\\n\r\nLength: Honestly?  I think this series shouldn't have even been able to get off the ground -- whoever greenlighted this should probably get fired.\\n\\n\r\nBut, in the long run, this was just way too long.  I was starting to get sick of this around episode 13.  If they went and retooled the whole damn thing (and maybe took care of the issues with the plot and the characters), they should've been able to wrap this up in about sixteen to twenty episodes, and had a chance of it being decent, too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A pretty, well-acted series that, unfortunately, is an EXTREMELY loose adaptation of the original has nothing resembling a plot for most of its entirety, and when it does get a plot, it's quite WTF-ish, one-note characters that, for the most part, you will HATE with a passion by the third episode (except maybe for Tybalt) and music (save for the OP and the first ED) that doesn't help its case.\\n\\n\r\nStay as far away from this series as possible.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\r\nSeiyuu: 8/10\\n\r\nLength: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 29/50; 58% (F)",

            "content": "I decided to watch this series on a complete whim. As a lover of tragedies and angst, I've always liked the original Shakespearian play well enough, despite its many flaws. Unfortunately, if the original play had many flaws, then this incredibly loose adaptations has them tenfold.\r\nSTORY - There's no hiding from it. This series is a horrible bastardization of Shakespeare's play and retains very few similarities beyond character names, references, and the fact that Romeo and Juliet have the purest and most cliche love for each other ever! That said, the changes made are interesting, if nothing else. The fantasy elements don't seem important atfirst, but devour the series at the end, which I found very unpleasant and unnecessary. Indeed, the second half the series, because that's where most of the major divergence from the original play occurs, I found to be less entertaining than the first. Everything just got very repetitive after a while and I found myself not caring at all about the fate of the characters, which is never a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nBut even the story for the first half of the series wasn't very impressive in general, and even now, I'm not sure why I even bothered to finish off the series. The pacing was haphazard and there were far, far too many redundant scenes involving Romeo and Juliet's apparent infatuation with each other, not to mention certain character repeating themselves a thousand times, as if you didn't already know what was going on. I'm all for the romantic fluff, but come on, this is stupid. In summary, there was nothing great about the story of Romeo x Juliet at all, and that's considering I did like the original well enough. I suppose then, if you really didn't even like the original, you wouldn't find anything of interest here at all.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - I didn't really like any of the characters in RxJ. It was really kind of sad. I was especially disappointed that Mercutio's role was diminished greatly until near the end of the series and even then, he was not the character he was in the original -- upsetting because there, he was my favorite. Not to mention that he was incredibly out of character. Tybalt was similarly unrecognizable, but at least he remained Juliet's cousin, unlike Benvolio, who was no longer Romeo's cousin. Romeo and Juliet themselves were kind of... eh. Well, Romeo was a great, big pussy with that cliche sense of idealism and justice. This made him incredibly annoying for the entirety of the series, and I found it hard to sympathize with any pain and suffering he went through. \\n\\n\r\nJuliet was probably the most interesting character in the series, which really isn't saying much, but hey. Because she was forced to dress like a man all her life (to keep her identity a secret), she had a lot of boyish qualities about her and was therefore a little more badass than her original counterpart. This made it kind of interesting, but as the series progressed, she lost her male persona and her stereotypical girly qualities kind of took over, including lots of ridiculous heartbreak/lonely scenes that were full of ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nI found the stark good guy/bad guy division in this series to be incredibly boring. There didn't seem to be very many shades of grey and it was basically CAPULETS GOOD, MONTAGUES BAD, or at least, Lord Montague was the definition of EVILLLLL. This was painfully obvious in all interactions between Romeo and Lord Montague (his father).  Cliche character personalities are cliche. They tried to rectify this a little at the end by giving Lord Montague some pathetic sobstory to explain why he was the way he was, but it wasn't very convincing at all, and I certainly wasn't impressed.\\n\\n\r\nARTWORK &amp; ANIMATION - I really dislike the style RxJ is drawn in. The noses are just ginormous, and I don't like it. :( Other than that though, the animation in the opening is bloody gorgeous... too bad it doesn't carry into the series! Overall, I'd say the animation in the actual episodes was pretty average, maybe on the lower end of average though. I was especially not fond of how they treated equine anatomy, but that may just be me.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - The opening theme for RxJ is a Japanese cover of &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; (which has apparently been covered more than 125 times, according to Wiki). About half the music in the series was also this song, including an English cover by the same singer, and various instrumentals. Most of the other music was pretty negligible, probably because this theme is what stands out the most. It's a pretty song though and the artist, Lena Park, has a very nice voice. The end theme is okay, but nothing amazing.\\n\\n\r\nDUBBING/VOCALS - I saw this entire series subbed. Nothing stood out as good or bad, so I guess average all around.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - As you can see, this was a pretty mediocre series all around, and it's no wonder it wasn't very popular at all. Like I said, I still don't understand exactly why I got so hooked (I saw the entire series in about three days), especially since I'd recognize its sub par quality from the very beginning, but I did, so I guess there has to be some redeeming qualities about it... I just can't really think of any right now. But that might be because I really hated the ending, which I found incredibly lame! In conclusion, I don't recommend this in particular unless you're really curious or really bored. :3",

            "content": "Firstly, it's important to point out that the name of this series is NOT \"Romeo and Juliet\" for a reason, that being it's not a clone of Shakespeare's original play. Now, I for one find that there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, but for those who are either expecting the famous classic or cannot bear to see an exploratory remake, this series is NOT for you.\r\nOkay, that out of the way...\r\nRomeo X Juliet is a fantasy spin on its namesake with adorable characters and a team of well placed seiy\u016b- including my personal favorite Ry\u014dtar\u014d Okiayu (e.g: Byakuya from Bleach). Much like the playit is based on, this series holds a combination of romance, drama, and conflict. However, unlike Shakespeare's original piece, the various plots and stories within (there are about 3) could actually stand on their own. \\n\r\nSticking true to its predecessor, Romeo and Juliet are nobles from opposing households who fall in love and as a result must embark on numerous obstacles in order to be together. The twist to this tale, aside from the fantasy element, is that the bloodline of one household has been almost completely eradicated by the other, and its sole survivor is pressed to take revenge not just in retaliation, but for the good of an entire country. Combine such a journey with the conflicting hearts of the story's protagonists, and those that support and are against them, and you come out with a potentially interesting tale. Unfortunately, the series was not able to follow through on such potential, and came up lacking.\\n\r\nThe romance aspect, which is the story's backbone, does not have the intense passion and heart throbbing intrigue as one would expect from anything associated with 'Romeo and Juliet'. Rather, it comes across as very forced, and until the story's end it may have been better for everyone involved had the two lovers stuck to simply being friends.\\n\r\nAnother of its plot - remember I said there are about three - seems not only heavily out of place, but down right ridiculous as its presence is what determines the fate of the anime's hero and heroine...nope, I will not say what it entails as that alone would be one major spoiler.\\n\\n\r\nAnother reason why the story was unable to realize its full potential, lays with the horrendous character design of Juliet. It is obvious that the female protagonist was meant to be shown as a strong and capable female, but instead she comes across as flat, worthless, selfish, and highly annoying. This may be the reason that the romance between her and Romeo failed to come across with any sort of intensity, as her personal character was so lacking that she is the last person best suited for a someone like Romeo. Romeo, with his genuine heart, spontaneity and naivety, comes across as so real and immensely lovable, that to hand him off to one such as Juliet is a moral felony. Unlike Juliet's superficial emotions, Romeo's feelings come across with such immense depth that I can say he is the only one of the two who really knew how to love, and was in love.\\n\r\nThe other characters are very noteworthy. Once again, I must point out that since things have been changed from the original play, do not be surprised that it affects the characters as well. However, despite their change, the main elements that made them unique in Shakespeare's original, still holds very true to them in the series. It is easy to get caught up in how drastic the changes are, but if you take a breather and step back, you will see that it really works for them - the core is still the same.\\n\r\nMy personal favorites, aside from Romeo, are Francisco (the story's bijin because you know there just had to be at least one) and Curio - Juliet's bodyguards who do indeed lash out at the heroine when she is being fickle (much to my pleasure),  Willy - who is very noteworthy as you can say he depicts the role of Shakespeare and it is this experience that has caused the original tale to come about, and Antonio - Juliet's pint sized, side-kick with a heart of strength and gold.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art in the series is nothing to rave about. It is simply Decent where the main characters are the only ones who get much artistic attention (which is far cry away from being detailed), and people in the background are portrayed with bland outlines and fillings. The backdrop - buildings, landscape and etc...range from Poor to Decent as one would expect much more from a fantasy setting. The color is not as bright and whimsical as it should have been, given its genre and setting, and things do appear painstakingly bland.\\n\\n\r\nThe Music was a disappointment. There is barely, if anything, remarkable about the soundtrack. There is nothing that will captivate and reel you in. There are no tunes that will make you feel the anguish and beauty of love and the character's situation, and there is nothing riveting for moments of battle or dark scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it was quite a chore to sit through 24 episodes of this. Things did not start to get interesting (at least, as interesting as it could get for this series) until about the 10th episode and then it fell yet again. I was very happy when it ended.\\n\r\nIt's important to note that my dislike for the anime has nothing to do with the changes to the original piece - If anything I really enjoyed that much and I honestly think that Shakespeare himself would applaud it as well...this coming from a Shakespeare fanatic. It is poor because it had such great potential, such a talented staff, but it did not follow through.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I went into this anime not expecting to like it very much.  I am not a fan of Shakespeare.  I am also not a fan of plots that showcase war and revenge.  As it turned out, I am, however, a fan of Romeo X Juliet. \r\nThis is NOT your ordinary melodramatic love story.  This is an adventure.\r\nAll of the characters are presented well and integrate with the story seamlessly, allowing this fictional world to brim with life, with living, breathing characters.  Romeo and Juliet are portrayed as strong and brave protagonists that dynamically grow through each episode.  The Capuletsquickly become likable comrades plotting against the Montagues through perfect camaraderie, and this coupled with Romeo and Juliet overcoming regular adversities kept me watching.  You can't help but care for them all.  And the romance isn't sappy, but captivating and without a single blemish in its execution.  Best of all, there are no fillers; each episode is dense with quality content.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the anime might not adhere to Shakespeare's version to the T, but I loved the enhancements: Juliet as a cool Zorro-like figure, Neo Verona set in the skies, and especially the flying pegasus!   The visuals are fantastic, from character design to setting detail and imagination... everything!  Be sure to watch this one on a large screen.  And the opening, with Lena Park's rendition of \"You Raise Me Up\"... a slice of heaven right there.  I wasn't a fan of the ending though, and the more magical aspects of this anime (e.g. the tree near the end) did not seem to fit very well.  \\n\\n\r\nPlease try it.  The first few episodes should be all it takes.",

            "content": "An anime version of Romeo and Juliet? Interesting. \r\nBut its a loose adaptation. Very loose. Don't expect Romeo X Juliet to be like the original Shakespeare play. This review, is written by a person who never read the play but has researched enough about it. Arguably, all the characters in this anime are made differently, unintentionally or not, from their counterparts. And from these traits we get an awfully plentiful disagreeing opinions.\r\nNow for a detailed review...\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe discussion of this part is going to be longer than the others because its the core of the anime, being an \"adaptation.\" Let us begin with the basics;the original Romeo and Juliet is a very romantic tragedy with intense passion and drama of two very young lovers from enemy clans. And undeniably, it could be the most famous love story written, romanticizing love at a very high level. Also, the play has many social and societal issues that are heavy for younger people.\\n\\n\r\nBut, Romeo X Juliet defied the themes of the original by setting a different, lighter mood through a fantasy world. It was not made to adapt the original at all. The given conflict of the Capulet and the Montagues' dispute is briefly introduced to give way to additional plot lines such as oppression of the masses, heroism and coming of age. In context, this anime does not fall short of creativity in interpretation and twists in respect to the Shakespeare's play.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, the heart of the story is the love between Romeo and Juliet- romance. And I can say that made a good job in creating interesting sweet and innocent love story between the two characters through memorable cinematic scenes. It was further made good by many emotional lines and dialogues, both original and quoted from the play itself, that are appropriately romantic.Those wonderful aesthetic qualities combined with the challenges the two must face warms up the interesting and the well-paced story.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, though it has many notable rare qualities, its full of inconsistencies and wasted potential. I repeat, a lot of wasted potential; foreshadowing and the plot itself. Somehow, this anime introduces a lot of unconventional and promising conflicts, especially at the beginning, that disappointingly, unexplored further or left hanging. The Capulet and the Montagues' dispute was rather shallow and offers cliched character involvement which will be elaborated later in the review. Other notable examples could be the new characters, duty and a possible forbidden love.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has a bad habit of introducing something big and exciting, and suddenly replacing it with in-character yet obvious internal conflicts, and gets resolved in a manner that's nothing brilliant. In par with this, many sub-plots have thin links with the main focus of the show. And most probably, the greatest weakness of the anime was the short climax build-up that lacks intensity. And the \"climax\" itself, a poor attempt to adapt the ending of the original, is totally unrelated to the path leading to it. Lastly, there are some important plot devices that makes very little sense at all.\\n\\n\r\nBut one thing makes all of these work: Romeo and Juliet. Their fairy-tale like romance is just so addictive because of its innocent nature. Ideally, they're in love, but in a mature perspective, its an obvious infatuation and a very compatible friendship. Its not intense, passionate and dark but rather the opposite.  And of course, if they're together, they make it look that everything will work out. Well, the series did work out because of them, the anticipation of a different ending is a driving force to finish the series.\\n\\n\r\nPure romance is excellent, everything else that complements it are mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nArtistically, this anime has done very well in dramatizing the themes with an excellent opening. Not only that, as I mentioned, cinematography and the bright mood of lovely scenes made its romance element noteworthy. However, the setting, the clothes, the building designs, appropriate they be, are nothing exceptional or new for they are based of from real life designs, except the pegasus perhaps. Romeo and Juliet's color schemes work well andare memorable. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is another downer. It was inconsistent at most.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song itself \"Inori (You raise me up)\" by Lena Park raised the score of this anime. It was beautiful, intense and well performed and placed in appropriate scenes in different themes. Disappointingly, the endings songs are pale in comparison with it.\\n\\n\r\nBackground music is as inconsistent with the story. It is very touching, light, mellow with Romeo and Juliet scenes and anything concerning romance. It adds up to the feeling of love in many scenes and makes them more memorable. So; the light romantic element itself is again portrayed exceptionally, everything else seems so bland and lacking.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nA Code Geass Review has this line but I guess it will be very appropriate to put it here too:\\n\\n\r\n\"All the world's a stage,\\n\r\nAnd all the men and women merely players;\\n\r\nThey have their exits and their entrances;\\n\r\nAnd one man in his time plays many parts...\" - Shakespeare\\n\\n\r\nWilliam itself is in the anime, a nice caricature. Though he has minimal involvement he his comments are a nice homage and perspective to what what happening. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the anime are different and can be considered \"twisted\" versions of the original. Let us begin with the main protagonists; Romeo and Juliet:\\n\\n\r\nJuliet is probably the true heroine of the story and she is very tradition defying one. She's considerably lacks maturity, evident from her views, actions and emotional responses. Yet, her strength and capabilities in leadership and combat pushes a fairly well development on her side. And being torn between her duty and her feelings for Romeo, the way she overcomes the hurdles of of these internal struggles is something that only few female characters achieved. The used metaphor for actions, also for her love and determination she shared with Romeo, the \"wind\" suits her role in stirring a revolution and going against the odds. She's apparently more level-headed than the original Juliet.\\n\\n\r\nRomeo too, is a very unique prince, because his role of a child of an influencial/evil person, a kindhearted noble who advocates reform, well mannered, naive and innocent nature are the usual stereotypes for lead heroines: That's right, mainly princesses. But he fitted his role well and it's in tandem with his idealism and pure, young love for Juliet. And amazingly,none of these traits badly affect his male protagonist image, but rather it makes him more lovable and adorable. On the other hand, the real Romeo is impulsive, violent and too passionate according to some sources.\\n\\n\r\nRomance worked out very well between the two, but again, mostly everything else is utterly mediocre. One big flaw is the lack of intense reaction from the other characters regarding RXJ love. It should be outrageous, scandalous, disappointing, shocking- all kinds of emotions to further juxtapose love. But all the characters are lacking in that area so the challenges RxJ face aren't romantic in nature themselves but rather situational or societal. Personal issues are always defeated by love. And like what I explained earlier, those conflicts have wasted big potentials.\\n\\n\r\nThe best example of poor character involvement is the repetitive \"Montagues are evil\" and \"The Capulets must be destroyed.\" And the reason for that? Cliches...\\n\\n\r\nThrough all those negative attributes, the side characters are not that bad at all. There is the presence of nice best friends like Benvolio and Cordelia. Loyal protector with interesting little secrets and personalities like Curio and Francisco are very likable. The cast from the original play is certainly \"animated\" here, as alternate persons. Although the background people are decent enough, some of them made no contribution to the overall drama; just creating additional insignificant situations.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nThis is very opinionated and based on my preference; I had high hopes for this series but I was very disappointed. But I can say that I did enjoy it, especially the lovely scenes between RxJ. It succeeds in making the audience experience the kind of love that is shared between the two. I makes people \"fall in love.\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n",

            "content": "From the name of the anime, you can tell what it will be about, based on Shakespeare's original work. \r\nEven from watching the opening theme, you can see that the series does not appear to be like the original, so don't expect it and judge this series based on that. For example... flying horses?\r\nThe story is extremely well played out. The only reason why I didnt rate the story any higher was that sometimes, the fantasy elements were too much, and didnt always fit in *spoiler* (Escalus). Only at the very end do all the elements fit together. Although almost everyone knows how a Romeoand Juliet story should end, you cant help but anticipate what twist Gonzo will throw in. Most of the story's details are different from the original, but all the underlying themes are there.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful. The character designs are different from commonplace anime designs, and the backgrounds are amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is amazing. The opening theme suits the anime very well. The insert song in episode 7 was AMAZINGLY placed and well done... brought me to tears. The ending songs are also good, but at first they dont seem to fit. But as you sit and listen to it and think about the episode.. it just feels right.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the characters the most in this series. One thing I didnt like about the original story was the love between Romeo and Juliet. It seemed more like infatuation, and there was no development of love between them. In this adaptation. there is actually love. You see the characters struggle and love each other so much. Actually, I havent seen such good relationship development in anime for a while (and this includes romance animes). The other characters, although almost all of them have a different role, all fit their new roles very well. \\n\\n\r\nI found this series extremely enjoyable and definitely recommend it to any anime viewer who enjoys adaptations, and a clean anime full of love and struggle.\\n",

Thankfully the anime series is a whole lot better.\r\nRomeo X Juliet is a extraordinary anime series. There is the same story of two waring families, and the two children from the families falling in love. There are so many things that make this a great anime series. First the story, sure there's the same classic story, but GONZOadded much more and new twists to the story. The world the anime series takes place in is wonderful. A mysterious land floating in the sky, winged horese, and of course the Tree called Escalus. The mystery behind the floating land is the real story. The love story, between Romeo and Juliet is just a added benefit.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were also amazing. GONZO brought many changes to them, adding more life to them than in the classic play. Characters from Lady Portia(Romeo's Mother), William, Ophelia, and many more.\\n\\n\r\nNext is the music, which is excellent on par with Fullmetal Alchemist, but a notch below Cowboy Bebop.\\n\\n\r\nFinally the animation is done by GONZO. The did a stunning job with Romeo X Juliet, it just amazes me how good a job they do.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Romeo and Juliet is a classic anime series, and is in my top 5 anime series I've seen",

            "content": "When i first saw the title, i though it would be quite a cliche anime since the story itself is quite well known. But i must applaud the effort put in by the studio in adding a lot of extra detail while still being able to maintain the original storyline. Myself being a fantasy lover was immediately taken in by the flying horses and mythical tree. I think that they made the story more interesting and enhanced the mood,especially the drama in the show. So in terms of the story it was quite well done in my opinion and should not be taken lightly becauseof its title.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was fairly good, although i don't pay that much attention to the artwork,there were certainly no noticeable flaws in the animeand the characters were drawn quite well.\\n\\n\r\nThe Songs in the show were quite an interesting selection. The opening was a surprise to me in that i never imagined there would be japanese version of the song &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot;, but it fitted well with the anime. The ending was more upbeat then the opening which i squite different from your usual anime but i guess i dont detest it since its something different fro a change. The inserts of the english version of the opening helps to enhance the mood in the story and her voice is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters is of course what makes the story so great.However, in this anime too much focus is on the main characters and the supporting characters do not get much showtime, so it is a bit onesided. But they still used the supporting character well to create the setting i shant spoil it.It is also interesting to see William in the anime acting as if the story actually originated from this anime and his presence is another interesting feature of this anime\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime because i myself am a romance-drama anime fan. But i found it different from the original shakespeare version and it draws me in. The conflict and burden of the names that the two must carry draws in the audience and the ending is somewhat satisfying even though it is meant to be a tragedy, it was portrayed in a manner that seems like a happy ending which is good because i hate those open endings.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is a good anime worth watching and should not be judged based on its title, i hope this was helpful to whoever reads it, its only my first review though.",

            "content": "In a word: disappointing.  The early episodes showed the potential to be an exciting and imaginative spin on an old classic; but it wound up being dragged down by serious pacing problems and a plot that was all over the place. There were too many things that seemed to happen for no particular reason other than they needed a dramatic plot development at that moment. \r\nSometimes a mediocre story can be saved by the characters.  The characters in this series are likeable enough and several have the potential to be interesting, but most of the time their development is too lacking or rushedto be satisfying.  Particularly frustrating is Juliet herself, whom they try to present as a 'strong and spirited heroine' through the old shoujo shorthand of having her dress as a boy and swing a sword around; but she always seems to forget how to use it and trip over her own feet any time Romeo, Curio, Tybalt, or any other guy needs to dramatically come to her rescue.\\n\\n\r\nEven as simple eye candy, the show doesn't quite measure up.  Although the character and environment designs are gorgeous, the animation is inconsistent from episode to episode.  (Also, if you're going to have flying horses as a major element in a series, you'd better make sure you have the budget to animate them decently!)",

            "content": "\"Just another adaptation of one of Shakespeare's most popular plays. Boring.\" This was more or less what I thought when I stumbled upon Romeo x Juliet a while ago. One look at the opening credits of this anime suggested that I may have judged it too hastily, and 24 episodes later I knew I was definitely wrong.\r\nIt's a difficult task to improve upon the original story of Romeo and Juliet, a tremendous tale full of romance and tragedy. This anime adaptation pays a lot of respect to Shakespeare's famous work, and yet also manages to throw in so much of it's own ideas. Unlike the1996 American film adaptation which was set in modern-day Verona, the anime changes the setting to Neo Verona, an aerial continent. Incorporated into this new fantasy setting are elements such as dragon steeds and enchanted trees. Rather than having two warring families on equal grounds, the anime instead depicts the Montagues as the dominant family, who force the Capulets into hiding for several years. The main theme of the story remains the same, with an ill-fated love between Romeo and Juliet accompanied by a rebellion by the Capulets towards the Montagues. However, the anime also includes many action scenes which gives the series plenty of energy and excitement. No matter how much one wishes against it though, the anime stays true to its roots and provides a tearjerker of an ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Romeo x Juliet is excellent during the first half of the series, but unfortunately there is a dip in quality during the second half. The character models are simple but effective, whereas the city of Neo Verona is shown in great detail and full of vibrant colours. The action sequences are also well animated.\\n\\n\r\nThe musical score supports this anime very well, and most of the tracks are used at the most suitable moments to create uplifting, dramatic, or sad atmospheres. The narrative is also superb, keeping in tone with Shakespeare's original play by including lines which use an older style of English as well as many of his quotes. The opening song (Inori ~ You Raise Me Up) is extremely soothing and fits the overall theme of the story perfectly. However, the first ending song doesn't suit this anime at all, whereas the second ending is fairly average when compared to the opening.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Romeo x Juliet don't disappoint either, and a lot of them feel like a breath of fresh air to the story. If you've seen or read the original play, forget what you already know about Mercutio and Tybalt, because they (among a few others) have different backgrounds and personalities. There are quite a number of new characters introduced, including one who is basically Shakespeare himself! The side characters are interesting to a certain extent in their own little ways, and provide decent support to the main leads. Surprisingly, the background of Romeo\u2019s father is explored in quite a bit of detail, which partly helps to explain why he acts like a tyrant. Then we come to Romeo and Juliet, who as expected get the most screentime and development out of the whole cast. The length of the series allows it to take the time to develop each of the two main leads individually and thoroughly; Romeo has a strong desire to help others despite a lack of affection from his tyrannical father, whereas Juliet masquerading as a hero of justice is a great idea and provides another dimension to her character (she can handle a sword just as well as anyone in this show). The chemistry between the two feels very realistic and heartwarming, and never too cheesy. \\n\\n\r\nRomeo x Juliet is a great series to watch, feeling familiar yet new at the same time. The main part of Shakespeare's play is still here, but there are so many other aspects to it too. The pacing of the story slows down a little during the middle section (due to the two leads embarking on their own separate adventures for a while), but any other flaws aren't noticeable enough to detract from the enjoyment too much. Definitely recommended.\\n",

            "content": "I figured that I should write my first review with one of my favorite stories I've ever seen/read. Romeo x Juliet is one of the most romantic and tragic anime ever because it's derived from Shakespeare's play, Romeo and Juliet, duh. But the anime's story is a little bit different than Shakespeare's, with the addition of mythical creatures and magic to add even more drama into an already dramatic story. \r\nStory: The love story between Romeo Candorebanto Montague and Juliet Fiammata Asto Capulet. But instead of their parents being enemies and forbidding their love, the Montague family killed the entire Capulet family, except forJuliet who grows up to be the people's hero of justice, \"Red Whirlwind\". Meanwhile, the Montague family is a tyranny, and cruel to the people, therefore making them Juliet's opponent. And in the midst of a rebellion, Romeo and Juliet's destinies cross, and the all so romantic and tragic love story between Romeo and Juliet begins. I loved the anime version as much as I did the original play, and I LOVED the original play! There were moments... No, the entire anime was tugging at my feelings, there were many scenes where I couldn't help but cry soo much!!\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was the same as your typical anime made around 2007, not clear and beautiful, but a more realistic looking art. The characters were designed just the way I had imagined them when I read Romeo and Juliet. I loved the quiet symbolism of poison, roses and beautiful angelic wings. \\n\\n\r\nSound: This was amazing! Romeo and Juliet had the perfect voice cast for them! The music certainly made all the sad moments in Romeo and Juliet even sadder! The song, \"You Raise Me Up\" was beautiful and tear-jerking! Oh my goodness when it played at the end of the anime, I cried soo much!!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: A large variety of characters that could have been developed a bit more, or gotten a bit more screen time. But, there's my 2 favorites characters Romeo and Juliet, and that is enough for me. The romance and tragic level between Romeo and Juliet destroys my heart everytime I watch/read about them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed it so much, and I cried so much watching this anime. The anime isn't the same as the Shakespeare play. Romeo x Juliet has more mythical creatures and overdramatic sad scenes that grasps the attention of the audience more than Shakespeare's original play. Romeo x Juliet is definitely one of the greatest romance stories ever, and one of my favorite stories ever! Everyone must watch or read Romeo x Juliet!",

            "content": "SOUND/SONG/OP AND ED SONG...\r\nThe OP song of this anime is very suitable for the theme of the love story of Romeo and Juliet. I don't think any other music would perfectly fit this very emotional and somehow classic anime.\r\nHowever, the ED song for the first half of the anime is a rock/loud music, contrasting to its OP song, and it's not that suitable. However, I cannot totally judge this song because I never tried to listen to it completely. The second ED song is, i think, more suitable, because it has a nice melody, and the meaning of the song fits the story.\r\nART/ANIMATION:\r\nThe flying horsesthere are not consistent in terms of art and animation. However, the art/animation is not that bad and the characters were drawn well, and the conservativeness of the story is seen in the art of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\nI haven't read Romeo and Juliet, so this review is not that dependable to those who read it. But the way the story was put in the anime is very nice because even my little sister, who doesn't love serious romance animes, watched it and was very touched and very affected by it. The end is unpredictable, but because this story is famous for its tragic end, you would really want it to end the other way. You would want to have something, a sort of a miracle, to twist its story, because you feel you're a part of it, you feel like you're going to be greatly affected if it would end tragically, if it would end the original way.\\n\r\nEvery end of an episode keeps you hanging and asking for more. However, on the 22nd/23rd episode, you would want to end it there.\\n\r\nThe original story is translated in a nice way, because I understood the gist of the story.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nI liked the the way they retained the names of the characters.\\n\r\nAs of their roles, I found Juliet strong, but becomes weak when it comes to love, and is very indecisive when her love for Romeo will be greatly affected with her decision.\\n\r\nRomeo is the perfect guy a girl can have, as presented in this anime.\\n\r\nThe antagonists are effective antagonists because they can make you angry and pity the protagonists.\\n\r\nAbout the supporting characters, I think they supported the main characters well.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION/OVERALL:\\n\r\nThis is a very nice and classic romance anime, and it will keep you asking for more of it. You know, I didn't plan on writing a review for this, but after I finished watching it, I was greatly affected, even though 2 days passed by already. It's still fresh on my mind...\\n\r\nYou must watch this anime if you want simple and sweet romance love stories, without the Ecchiness, and with just pure feelings... ^_^",

            "content": "***This is a Spoiler-Free Review***\r\nAlright, for better or worse, shelve what you know about Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet, this anime is a fantasy-action and romance story loosely *inspired* by the timeless play, not quite an adaptation.  If that doesn't sound appealing or you were expecting Romeo & Juliet: the Noh Drama / [High School] Musical, you may leave.  The rest of you...have a seat.\r\nStory [6/10] - It should go without spoiling anything that the focus of the story is our hero Romeo and our heroine Juliet falling in love and the events that transpire before and as a result of this.  Towardsthe beginning of the anime, the creative liberties taken and new characters introduced are refreshing, exciting, and it's great to see the lens focused with Juliet as the main character.  The fantasy-like setting is fun.  It starts out having a great mix of the romance, gripping backstory, action, and character development.  Some shows use that momentum and ultimately finish out strong...but Romeo X Juliet sadly is not one of them.  Had the second half been as good as the first half this score would be much higher.  But if you appreciate good plot with an equally strong resolution rather than anime cliches, you like me will have an imprint of your face on your palm by the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation [5/10] - Oh boy.  At TIMES the art an animation quality are outstanding.  R x J is sometimes here, sometimes there.  Sometimes there are beautiful backgrounds with well drawn characters (the very beginning and very end are good examples), and at other times characters proportions, ESPECIALLY faces get completely screwed up the moment the character simply turns their head to face a different direction.  In one episode, I thought to myself \"they must have spent all the money for this episode on animating Juliet in that scene, because in this next scene Francisco's nose isn't on right...\" I always try to look at animation in perspective of when it was made, and at times R x J has the animation production value of a show made in 2001.  Gonzo and GK are both at fault here, because Gonzo is guilty of this in the past, and we all know they could have been better than that comparing to some of their other titles (even \"moeblob\" titles).\\n\\n\r\nSound (OST, OP/ED, Acting) [9/10] - \\n\\n\r\nThe OST is the true gem of this title.  Whether or not you ever watch this show, you owe it to yourself to listen to if not OWN this soundtrack.  Sakimoto-sensei is a man of exceptional talent, compared often to Uematsu Nobuo even though their styles are pretty different (probably by association to Final Fantasy, as his other famous work is the OST to FFXII).  The often fully-orchestrated tracks bring an unbelievable amount of live into the characters, at times almost TOO much.  But in this case, can't have too much of a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is also fabulous, naturally pretty much a cover of \"You Raise Me Up\", but Korean-born Lena Park sings it with vigor and when she hits the high notes, the timbre and beauty of her voice really shine.  Excellent staffing choice there.  The EDs are enjoyable enough to listen to, the 2nd more than the 1st, but are overall pretty forgetable.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the voice acting.  Well I'll just say... Gonzo sure as heck saved money in this department.  They probably spent most of their budget on Sakimoto-sensei.  The female seiyuu are composed of a lot of unknown talents, and some of the best seiyuu in the production (Iwao Junko, Saito Chiwa) play very minor roles.  The male seiyuu do a little better save for one gripe.  Those who pay attention to the \"acting\" part of voice acting may agree with me, but it takes true grit to put up with Romeo's voice for 24 episodes (let alone Mizushima-san's voice in general but that is an opinionated digression not suited for this review).  That aside the award for best role in the show goes to Ishii Kouji for his roles as Montague.  Truly brings out, and makes you hate, the character which brings me to my next section...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [6/10] - At the beginning of the show, this really is around an 8 or a 9.  The anime-original characters are very welcome, and whether or not you agree with the roles chosen for some similarly named characters from the play, the backstory of characters such as Tybalt are well written.  Montague especially seems to be the perfect villain in the beginning, and continues to be through the later half.  However...all semblance of character development seems to crumble in the last few episodes.  You feel as if you are watching one of Willy's plays, because if you, even based on the anime alone, sit and think \"what would the characters I have come to learn so much about over these past 20 episodes do in this kind of situation?\" you'd be surprised at how contrary their actions seem, as if they are puppets in a play...or victims of poor writing on the staff's part.  Some characters are completely forgotten, whilst others are simply assigned stereotypical \"roles\" which completely overwrite their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [7/10] - On the whole a fairly enjoyable title.  The ups generally outweigh the downs and if you're looking for fantasy-romance, you can do worse than R x J.  Some of the well written parts make the show worth seeing on the whole, and the incorporation of the OST as well as some of the \"new\" or \"refreshed\" characters give this title life differentiated from the Shakespeare play.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (not an average) [7/10] - Based on the ANN Rating System \"Good, worth seeing\" Naturally there are negatives, the art and animation being the primary factor, and the somewhat rushed writing towards the end of the anime. But on the positive, the refreshed setting, new characters, and most of the character development make it worth the ride and some scenes may even be worth a rewatch.  Like a good coaster, you will enjoy most of the ride, you just might get gas pains afterwards from that chili you ate before.\\n\\n\r\nRewatch Value: Low",

            "content": "As an English Major in University, I would be the first to say that Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is far from the masterpiece many think it is. \r\nThe original play is rushed, unbelievable and ultimately the characters themselves are most at fault. Romeo and Juliet are nothing more than lovestruck teenagers, who cannot stop thinking about their libido long enough for the play not to end in tragedy. That being said, Romeo x Juliet is an inventive interpretation of one of the worlds most famously known plays. \r\nStory:\r\nThe story of Romeo x Juliet, is thankfully, a pretty big departure from the original. Adding in aflair of fantasy while keeping the true essence of what Shakespeare was supposedly trying to achieve in telling a tragic love story. What falls flat ultimately though is the pacing of the story and parts of its presentation. The introduction of Escalus and Juliet's true destiny should have been introduced much sooner, as well as a lot of the development that worked to make the love between them more realistic broke the pace of what could have been a true masterpiece. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI quite liked the art of this adaption, the contrasting images of Montague Blue and Capulet Red was nice along with the bright colours and flowers that populated Neo Verona. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nWhen I first heard the intro song I was off put by how familiar it was. It wasn't long until I realized it was a cover of You Raise Me Up,  and while at first I wasn't too fond of it, I'm not too fond with most versions of it to be fair, it grew on me and ultimately fit well with the story. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters of Shakespeare's play are ultimately its downfall. Romeo and Juliet are basically moronic teenagers who get themselves killed, while it may be romantic, the pacing would show that it was nothing more than momentary lust and you lose a lot of the sense of tragedy or romance that would normally be perceived. Romeo x Juliet does a lot to alleviate this, however it still falls short. Romeo is honestly a bore and Juliet is the clich\u00e9d mold of a anime heroine, but both are huge steps in the right direction in comparison to Shakespeare's version. The twists that were added to such characters like Tybalt and Mercutio were wonderful delights and if only all were utilized in such a fashion this could have been so much more. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nLike I stated before I am an English Major in University, so coming across Shakespeare's work is pretty much unavoidable. I've never been much of a fan, but do enjoy some of his plays, unfortunately Romeo and Juliet is not one of them. After having to recently right an essay on it, I remembered this adaptation and low and behold, honestly and truly loved it. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nExcept for a few misteps, this is definitely an anime worth watching. If you know the original at all, it is almost a crime not to watch this just to see it in a different light. I give this anime 8/10.",

            "content": "Okay, lets start off with saying that everyone knows Shakespeare' s Romeo and Juliet. It's a well established play and movies have followed (with one coming soon). So when I came in to watch this anime I thought I knew what I was going into. The same old same old, right?\r\nWrong. \r\nRomeo x Juliet tell the tale of two lovers named Romeo and Juliet but that's as far as the relevance to the play goes. In this version there's pegasi, evil Dukes, magic trees, long lost relatives and a rebel fighter. Sounds appetizing right? Wrong again. Romeo x Juliet has been one of the mostboring and agonizing anime adventures I have had.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10 - I have to say that Gonzo were creative with changing the story to a well known topic. They did it in such a way where even though you think you know the outcome, you second guess yourself and then third guess. I was surprised with the plot during most of the anime. Though, at times I was let down by the randomness and the loose wires left laying around. Sometimes I found myself thinking that some scenes were unnecessary to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10 - I wasn't a big fan of the character art but the scenery was spectacular. The buildings really were drawn in the style of Italy in the Middle Ages. The flowers were also well drawn and easily distinguishable. There isn't really much to talk about the art, it was good.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10 - The best aspect of the anime by far. The OP (which is a Japanese version of You Raise Me Up) sounded so beautiful and I always looked forward to listening to it. The ED during the first half was also really good, it was more of an upbeat song which suited the anime. The ED during the second half wasn't as good but it suited the more serious phase the anime was entering. The background music was always well timed and set the mood.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10 - BOOM and the anime just explodes at this point. The characters were terrible. If this was based off Shakespeare' s Romeo and Juliet, couldn't some characters at least remained the same? My favourite character, Mercutio, was crumbled and desrroyed. That aside, lets say for originality purposes. Then there's the way characters were made to seem unnecessarily evil. They had evil cackles, the eyes, the terrible lines and altogether seemed over the top and unnatural. Duke Montague was portrayed awfully and so was the Friar. Many characters from the play didn't even make an appearance, for originality again maybe? And don't even get me started on Romeo and Juliet. Romeo seemed so emotionless at so many scenes and too emotional at some. He was shown as an ignorant child (which I guess he was so they did something right). Juliet as the Red Whirlwind was one of the most kickass characters but as soon as she took off that mask, she became an underdeveloped and wimp-like character. The only decent characters which stopped me from giving this section a 0 was Tybalt (and his muscly arms), Antonio, Francisco and a bit of Benvolio.\\n\\n\r\nOverall,  I give this anime a 5/10. Through the first half of the anime I found myself completely dull with no emotions towards the anime. As the anime continued, I found myself wanting to hurry up and finish it so I could write this review. It wasn't a waste of time because I now appreciate Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet a lot more. The occasional quotes from the play were a treat and I do admit some scenes were cute. Yet, I wouldn't recommed this to many but if you wouldn't mind having the flower power 'peace man' quota being thrown around, go ahead and give this a shot. I definitely don't want to be rewatching this.",

            "content": "I was recommended RomeoxJuliet as \"something to poke fun at.\" For the first three episodes, I felt pained by how bad it felt and really did just poke fun at it. But when I went back to it, I realized that it was \"funny\" in and only in that it was how I was expecting it. Also, the script in the first few episodes is a bit jolty in its wording from modern to archaic and back. That levels out pretty soon, and is very smooth and beautiful. Sub and Dub are both done quite well, and I do believe that Chris Burnett as Romeodid the least cheesy \"No!\" I have ever heard. \\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, it is solid. There were a couple of plotholes here and there like just about any story, but for the most part it flowed quite well. Escalus is brought in smoothly, even though it's kind of like \"okay. tree. your point?\" at first. But it is incorporated well, even though it doesn't come in until halfway through the series. \\n\\n\r\nMy only complaints are the Red Whirlwind and the color-coding. I know that color-coding is common in anime, but RomeoxJuliet seemed to take it to an extreme that it became a plothole. I get the hair matching the coat-of-arms, but the clothing, the cloaks, the swords, the eyes? It got a smidgen ridiculous. As for the Red Whirlwind, how come no one could guess it was Juliet? No one else would wear that much pink. And the fact that the Red Whirlwind looks like a pink Zorro did not help in taking-this-seriously factor.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, wow, where to begin. It would be easier to list who I didn't like, because that list is so much smaller. All the characters had depth. Romeo, Juliet, Francisco, Curio, Tybalt, even Benvolio had a level of depth in his quirks and maturing. Romeo and Juliet's love and attraction grows quite beautifully and smoothly. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this quite a bit. If you want a beautiful, well-done, sappy story, I'd suggest trying RomeoxJuliet. Also, it does not have a violence and profanity level worth of the R rating MAL gives it. While a bit of gore and violence is defintiely present, there is nothing being severed, and most blood is all post-act.",

            "content": "Ah, Romeo and Juliet. Probably the most enduring love story of all time. The story of passionate young star crossed lovers, in passionate searing love, falling into the hands of an impossibly tragic fate in order to teach their quarreling families and the audience a lesson about innocence in the midst of violence and hatred. Lovely and stirring and compelling, right? I sure think so. So being the really really pathetic Shakespeare nerd that I am....and a huge fan of anime I thought to myself, \"ROMEO AND JULIET IN AN ANIME????\" *nerdgasm* \"I MUST SEE THIS\".\r\nbut\r\nafter seeing it, all I could think was \"poo.\"\r\nSTORY\r\nThis anime,despite it's lovely name and main characters named after the protagonists of Shakespeare's masterpiece, is absolutely NOT the classic \"Romeo and Juliet\" that I was expecting....and wished that the anime delivered. Don't get me wrong. The fact that they changed the story...or wrote an entirely different story stickered with the name of Romeo X Juliet...though unexpected, did not soil my opinion of the anime. In fact, the main premise of the story was very compelling and some aspects of it were good. Very good in fact. BUT OH. the tragedy of this take on Romeo and Juliet was not in the story. It was in the writing. So much potential to be a good series! So many ways that the story could have succeeded! Oh how I flinched while I watched this series as each and every good thing this series had going for it turned to dust with each completely unnecessary arc to enter into the story. Simplicity is beautiful. I wish the writers knew this. So instead of witnessing the achingly pure innocent love story that is at the very heart of Romeo and Juliet...and this series...the love story aspect gets bogged down and diminished by all of the extra unneeded overly angsty arcs that begin to clutter up the last 1/3 of the series. I'm not saying that this series was not a \"romance\" series. It was very \"romantic\". It had all the cheesy lines and the cutesy couple scenes. But that isn't what Romeo and Juliet is all about! IT'S ABOUT PASSION. But the romance in this series was...bland.  Romeo and Juliet, oh Romeo and Juliet where for art thou romantic beautiful version of Romeo and Juliet?? *cries* \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI actually enjoyed the artistic aspect of this series quite a bit. Yes, the animation was not top-notch. at all. But the soft tones and muted pastelly well detailed backgrounds really were pretty. They almost made me feel as if I were watching a fairy tale. The character designs were nice too. I really loved the innocent boyishness of Romeo's appearance and Juliet was not the fickle little thing that she normally gets portrayed as. Overall, the art was not the most disappointing part of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe music for this series is lovely. It's frilly and fantastical and it matches the tone of the series perfectly. Not perfect, but nice. I really love the song \"you raise me up\" which the series adapted as its themesong. SO ROMANTIC. too bad it was probably the most romantic part of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThank goodness the characters in the series were awesome. Otherwise my score for it would've ended up a lot lower. But the characters really make this series. I loved that Juliet was not portrayed as a weak fickle damsel. Not only is she super strong and courageous, she's a freaking super hero! That rocks. I also liked how Romeo was portrayed. He wasn't the little hormonal whiny sop that he normally is portrayed as...instead, he's level headed and rational and strong. I dig that. The supporting characters, although MUCH less developed, were likable and enjoyable to watch as well. Each one plays a role in the story and makes the viewer have a deeper interest in what was going in the series. Even if the story was not perfect, the characters carried it quite well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall\\n\r\nWas this series Romeo and Juliet, the masterpiece, the tragic tale of passion and love?? Definitely not. But this series was not terrible either. It was, for the most part intriguing and enjoyable. As long as you don't mind A LOT of revisions to the original story and messy somewhat disappointing writing, I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy it.",

            "content": "What can we expect from a title that says Romeo x Juliet? Probably a cheesy and draggy remade version of the original story that has no dept whatsoever. \r\nBut I was utterly wrong. Simply bear in mind that this is the Anime Version of Romeo and Juliet, and expect what you'll expect from most anime for eg, fantasy. I'm no fan of Shakespear's work but I do know the general outline of the story and the important scenes such as the balcony which audience will get to enjoy during the course of the series (although I'm guilty of laughing at that part). \r\nStory wise -Firstly, I'm very impressed by the various climax and exciting moments in this series. The first 10 episodes or so will keep you on your toes while tugging your emotions along with the sweet and tragic moments of our main characters. Following episodes then mellow down, and just when I thought it's gonna get boring here forth the story picks up again and you just have to keep watching. ie. damn high priority. However, you may find yourself with a big &quot;huh?!&quot; at the last few eps. Yes there's where the Fantasy kicks in although if you have watched enough anime, you'll know that this is a typical storyline and thus befitting for this series as well. In general, the story was well remade for an anime indeed.\\n\\n\r\nArt - The style may be a little hard to stomach for some but fret not, you'll get used to it in 1 or 2 episodes' time. The background was beautiful in some scenes especially the extensive flower beds. In fact, during the course of watching this series, I actually felt that it's well drawn because the characters doesn't have oversized eyes (or boobs) or overly skinny limbs, unlike some other animes.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Needless to say, the opening is one where you'll keep listening to even after completing the series. Images from the anime will then naturally float into your mind. Yes that's how influential Lena Park's version of You Raise Me Up is.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - For this portion, I'll really have to give the director a big hug. Setting the side characters aside, the mental development of both our hero and heroine was well-balanced and developed. The romance between the 2 was nicely presented while slowly telling the audience how they fell in love. This part was absolutely perfect because a plain love-at-first-sight thing would cause the story to lose its meaning and turn me off quickly.\\n\\n\r\nDespite it being a great anime, I've gotta admit the presence of my fan-girling moments during the exceptionally sweet and touching moments which were strewed here and there. So fellow babes, watch this to ignite the shoujo heart in you!",

            "content": "Going into this series, I admit that I had braced myself for more of a tragedy than this.  Having acted in the original play, I know just how depressing and plain ol' emo it can be.  But this is truly something different.\r\nStory:  First off, the story is much more moving and uplifting than I was expecting.  There were times when I was actually moved to tears by the responses of characters to each other.  The story just barely follows Shakespeare's original story.  Basically put, if you're looking for an anime rendition of his story, you're looking in the wrongplace.  This is not to say that the story is bad in any sense of the word.  Rather, I think that Shakespeare would be proud of this expansion to his original story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  I'd have to say that the art section is the most disappointing of all.  Thankfully, this isn't saying too much.  The art from front to back is very well done.  Some of the townsfolk felt a little bit cheapened but I would count this as making sure the story is focused on who it should be.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  I have to admit, I'm extremely impressed with the sound from this anime.  From the musical compositions to the sound effects to the voice acting to one of the better renditions of &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; (performed by Lena Park).  As far as audio goes, darn impressive.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Only a couple of characters weren't all that impressive.  However, all of the key players are very well developed.  All of the seiyuu who performed did an excellent job indeed.  This really helped to bring out the characters personalities and brought life.",

            "content": "Title: Romeo x Juliet\r\nManga, Anime: Romeo x Juliet does have a manga spinoff, with art done by COM and story still done by Gonzo and Sky Perfect Well think, that began running in Kadokawa Shoten's Monthly Asuka on March 24th, 2007.  It is still running at this point in time, and has yet to be licensed Stateside.\r\nRomeo x Juliet is a twenty-four episode anime that was produced by Gonzo (famous for their work on Gankutsuou and Saikano) and directed by Fumitoshi Oisaki (this was his first major work as a director).  It ran from April 4th to September 26th, 2007 on Japanese TV,and, contrary to Funimation's giving subbers a cease and desist (which was on supposedly on behalf of Gonzo's requests for them to enforce Japanese copyright laws), the anime has NOT been licensed Stateside.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fourteen years ago, on the floating continent of Neo-Verona, the Montagues led a coup against the Capulets, and slaughtered the entire family, except for a young girl and her servant.  The girl, in the meantime, has been bought up as a boy, Odin, and kept in hiding, occasionally going out as the masked vigilante the Red whirlwind.  On the day of her sixteenth birthday, the day when her true identity is to be revealed, she meets Romeo, the son of the Montagues...\\n\\n\r\nAs you can tell, this is an EXTREMELY loose adaptation of the story.  And, honestly, it had the chance to be good.  However, the story has issues, and lots of them.  And to cover them requires some SPOILERS, so read ahead at your own risk\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all centers in the adaptation of the story.  It's absolutely bare-bones: two star-crossed lover from rival families who die. I'm not a Shakespeare purist at all, but dear GOD, they fucked a lot up.  They can't decide when to use Shakespearean dialogue or when to adapt it, or when to keep scenes from the original play in just to remind people that yes, this is an adaptation.  And for the recored, they fucked up the balcony scene in the extreme.  I'm sorry, but you have to be really trying with a vengance to mess it up.\\n\\n\r\nAnother major problem in this is the characters.  Gonzo might have been able to pull this off if they'd kept the original personalities from Shakespeare.  Instead, Romeo becomes a naive whiny little brat who waxes philosophically (and unconvincingly) about justice and freedom and peace once he is sent to work in the mines by his father (Maoist China, plz?), Juliet can't decide whether she wants to be a shoujo heroine destined to lead a revolution and avenge her parents or a whiny little Mary-Sue moping over her angsty past and her TRU WUV with Romeo, not to mention that she's supposedly uber-skilled with a sword, but makes incredibly stupid beginners mistakes at several critical times, and Tybalt, probably my favorite out of the whole lot, is dark and brooding and actually doesn't coddle Juliet, unlike most of the cast.  Other characters from other Shakespeare plays are thrown in haphazardly, but don't hold your breath waiting for them to be like in other plays; they're all butchered versions of their former selves (like most everyone else from the original Romeo and Juliet), most of whom are fawning over and coddling either Romeo or Juliet or both.  Background stories for some major characters (such as Tybalt and the generic evil tyrant Montague) don't come until later in the series, and when they do, it's just more WTF (Montague is a son of the Capulets and got adopted into the Montagues and backstabbed his way to the top in order to get his revenge on the Capulets for mistreating his mother, who was, in fact, a whore; and Tybalt is apparently the son of Montague and a Capulet woman - again, WTF?!)  The biggest issue with characters is the fact that NONE of them get any development; they're all one-note personalities running around in circles for most of the series.  \\n\\n\r\nThis, in turn, is compounded by the issue that, for most of the series, THERE IS NO PLOT.  It's either Juliet running around with Romeo in puppy love, angsting, or attempting to lead a revolution but failing at swordfighting when she's supposedly amazing at it, while Romeo either runs around with Juliet, tries to kindly let down his arranged fiancee, or starts to realize just what a douche his father is.  Gonzo tries to build the series on Romeo and Juliet's TRU WUV, but the most that it is is puppy love, as they never meet for anything more than six minutes, yet this is enough for them to decide to run away together about halfway through the series and marry each other and set up house in a pastoral village out in the middle of nowhere.  (...Then again, it was kind of like this in the original play, so they got that aspect down, to some degree.)  They get captured, though, and Romeo goes off to the mines to have a slight development arc that makes him even more annoying at the end of it, and Juliet goes off to finally lead that revolution (which is instigated by something so fucking EASY that it's a wonder they didn't try this years ago, let alone the other five times that the revolution failed in this series!).  And when the revolution comes about, it's glossed over to make room for the random tree that apparently keeps Neo Verona in the sky and that is dying because of the Montagues, and apparently Juliet is the next sacrifice to keep it alive.  This brings about the situation in the last two episodes that I bought up back in the third paragraph.  To say the least, this thing is a fucking MESS.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the whole story is made of FAIL.  There are bits of redemption that come through in Tybalt here and there, but all in all, this was just made of suck.  And you wonder where it comes from, because on the one hand, you've got stuff like Saikano, and Bokurano, and Gankutsuou (which was an EXCELLENT adaptation), and then on the other, you've got THIS.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Neo-Verona is absolutely beautiful.  Gonzo really tried to emulate classical Italian Renaissance architecture in its construction, and they did it well.  The winged horses that show up here and there in the series are pretty neatly designed and executed as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs could've been done better, I think.  Most everyone in this show looks pretty generic -- well-animated, for the most part, but fairly generic.  And there are times when it was pretty obvious that they were trying to save budget with pan shots, still frames, and glossing over fight scenes.  The animation quality dropped every once in a while, too.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: The background music for this was a study in extremes: it was either melodramatic or overdramatic string orchestra, to match the \"epic\" fight scenes and \"dramatic\" revelations, or soft and gentle string and piano numbers, to match the \"tender\" moments and the angst.  All in all, it took the suckiness to whole new places.\\n\\n\r\nThe two versions of the OP and its instrumental, a cover of Josh Groban's \"You Raise Me Up\" by Lena Park, were used at several points in the series, and even if I didn't really like where it was used, I liked the songs themselves.  The first ED, \"Cyclone\" by 12012, was a pretty nice rock piece as well.  I didn't like the second ED all that much, as it was another female emo ballad, which we kind of already had in the OP.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu: Overall, the seiyuu for this did a good job in portraying their characters, even if I hated their characters' guts.  Props especially to Tybalt and Montague's seiyuu, who pitched their voices so that they matched, something I didn't recognize till I saw them in scenes that happened one right after the other, which was a hint to a major (if slightly WTF-ish) plot point.\\n\\n\r\nLength: Honestly?  I think this series shouldn't have even been able to get off the ground -- whoever greenlighted this should probably get fired.\\n\\n\r\nBut, in the long run, this was just way too long.  I was starting to get sick of this around episode 13.  If they went and retooled the whole damn thing (and maybe took care of the issues with the plot and the characters), they should've been able to wrap this up in about sixteen to twenty episodes, and had a chance of it being decent, too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A pretty, well-acted series that, unfortunately, is an EXTREMELY loose adaptation of the original has nothing resembling a plot for most of its entirety, and when it does get a plot, it's quite WTF-ish, one-note characters that, for the most part, you will HATE with a passion by the third episode (except maybe for Tybalt) and music (save for the OP and the first ED) that doesn't help its case.\\n\\n\r\nStay as far away from this series as possible.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\r\nSeiyuu: 8/10\\n\r\nLength: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 29/50; 58% (F)",

            "content": "I decided to watch this series on a complete whim. As a lover of tragedies and angst, I've always liked the original Shakespearian play well enough, despite its many flaws. Unfortunately, if the original play had many flaws, then this incredibly loose adaptations has them tenfold.\r\nSTORY - There's no hiding from it. This series is a horrible bastardization of Shakespeare's play and retains very few similarities beyond character names, references, and the fact that Romeo and Juliet have the purest and most cliche love for each other ever! That said, the changes made are interesting, if nothing else. The fantasy elements don't seem important atfirst, but devour the series at the end, which I found very unpleasant and unnecessary. Indeed, the second half the series, because that's where most of the major divergence from the original play occurs, I found to be less entertaining than the first. Everything just got very repetitive after a while and I found myself not caring at all about the fate of the characters, which is never a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nBut even the story for the first half of the series wasn't very impressive in general, and even now, I'm not sure why I even bothered to finish off the series. The pacing was haphazard and there were far, far too many redundant scenes involving Romeo and Juliet's apparent infatuation with each other, not to mention certain character repeating themselves a thousand times, as if you didn't already know what was going on. I'm all for the romantic fluff, but come on, this is stupid. In summary, there was nothing great about the story of Romeo x Juliet at all, and that's considering I did like the original well enough. I suppose then, if you really didn't even like the original, you wouldn't find anything of interest here at all.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - I didn't really like any of the characters in RxJ. It was really kind of sad. I was especially disappointed that Mercutio's role was diminished greatly until near the end of the series and even then, he was not the character he was in the original -- upsetting because there, he was my favorite. Not to mention that he was incredibly out of character. Tybalt was similarly unrecognizable, but at least he remained Juliet's cousin, unlike Benvolio, who was no longer Romeo's cousin. Romeo and Juliet themselves were kind of... eh. Well, Romeo was a great, big pussy with that cliche sense of idealism and justice. This made him incredibly annoying for the entirety of the series, and I found it hard to sympathize with any pain and suffering he went through. \\n\\n\r\nJuliet was probably the most interesting character in the series, which really isn't saying much, but hey. Because she was forced to dress like a man all her life (to keep her identity a secret), she had a lot of boyish qualities about her and was therefore a little more badass than her original counterpart. This made it kind of interesting, but as the series progressed, she lost her male persona and her stereotypical girly qualities kind of took over, including lots of ridiculous heartbreak/lonely scenes that were full of ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nI found the stark good guy/bad guy division in this series to be incredibly boring. There didn't seem to be very many shades of grey and it was basically CAPULETS GOOD, MONTAGUES BAD, or at least, Lord Montague was the definition of EVILLLLL. This was painfully obvious in all interactions between Romeo and Lord Montague (his father).  Cliche character personalities are cliche. They tried to rectify this a little at the end by giving Lord Montague some pathetic sobstory to explain why he was the way he was, but it wasn't very convincing at all, and I certainly wasn't impressed.\\n\\n\r\nARTWORK &amp; ANIMATION - I really dislike the style RxJ is drawn in. The noses are just ginormous, and I don't like it. :( Other than that though, the animation in the opening is bloody gorgeous... too bad it doesn't carry into the series! Overall, I'd say the animation in the actual episodes was pretty average, maybe on the lower end of average though. I was especially not fond of how they treated equine anatomy, but that may just be me.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - The opening theme for RxJ is a Japanese cover of &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; (which has apparently been covered more than 125 times, according to Wiki). About half the music in the series was also this song, including an English cover by the same singer, and various instrumentals. Most of the other music was pretty negligible, probably because this theme is what stands out the most. It's a pretty song though and the artist, Lena Park, has a very nice voice. The end theme is okay, but nothing amazing.\\n\\n\r\nDUBBING/VOCALS - I saw this entire series subbed. Nothing stood out as good or bad, so I guess average all around.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - As you can see, this was a pretty mediocre series all around, and it's no wonder it wasn't very popular at all. Like I said, I still don't understand exactly why I got so hooked (I saw the entire series in about three days), especially since I'd recognize its sub par quality from the very beginning, but I did, so I guess there has to be some redeeming qualities about it... I just can't really think of any right now. But that might be because I really hated the ending, which I found incredibly lame! In conclusion, I don't recommend this in particular unless you're really curious or really bored. :3",

            "content": "Firstly, it's important to point out that the name of this series is NOT \"Romeo and Juliet\" for a reason, that being it's not a clone of Shakespeare's original play. Now, I for one find that there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, but for those who are either expecting the famous classic or cannot bear to see an exploratory remake, this series is NOT for you.\r\nOkay, that out of the way...\r\nRomeo X Juliet is a fantasy spin on its namesake with adorable characters and a team of well placed seiy\u016b- including my personal favorite Ry\u014dtar\u014d Okiayu (e.g: Byakuya from Bleach). Much like the playit is based on, this series holds a combination of romance, drama, and conflict. However, unlike Shakespeare's original piece, the various plots and stories within (there are about 3) could actually stand on their own. \\n\r\nSticking true to its predecessor, Romeo and Juliet are nobles from opposing households who fall in love and as a result must embark on numerous obstacles in order to be together. The twist to this tale, aside from the fantasy element, is that the bloodline of one household has been almost completely eradicated by the other, and its sole survivor is pressed to take revenge not just in retaliation, but for the good of an entire country. Combine such a journey with the conflicting hearts of the story's protagonists, and those that support and are against them, and you come out with a potentially interesting tale. Unfortunately, the series was not able to follow through on such potential, and came up lacking.\\n\r\nThe romance aspect, which is the story's backbone, does not have the intense passion and heart throbbing intrigue as one would expect from anything associated with 'Romeo and Juliet'. Rather, it comes across as very forced, and until the story's end it may have been better for everyone involved had the two lovers stuck to simply being friends.\\n\r\nAnother of its plot - remember I said there are about three - seems not only heavily out of place, but down right ridiculous as its presence is what determines the fate of the anime's hero and heroine...nope, I will not say what it entails as that alone would be one major spoiler.\\n\\n\r\nAnother reason why the story was unable to realize its full potential, lays with the horrendous character design of Juliet. It is obvious that the female protagonist was meant to be shown as a strong and capable female, but instead she comes across as flat, worthless, selfish, and highly annoying. This may be the reason that the romance between her and Romeo failed to come across with any sort of intensity, as her personal character was so lacking that she is the last person best suited for a someone like Romeo. Romeo, with his genuine heart, spontaneity and naivety, comes across as so real and immensely lovable, that to hand him off to one such as Juliet is a moral felony. Unlike Juliet's superficial emotions, Romeo's feelings come across with such immense depth that I can say he is the only one of the two who really knew how to love, and was in love.\\n\r\nThe other characters are very noteworthy. Once again, I must point out that since things have been changed from the original play, do not be surprised that it affects the characters as well. However, despite their change, the main elements that made them unique in Shakespeare's original, still holds very true to them in the series. It is easy to get caught up in how drastic the changes are, but if you take a breather and step back, you will see that it really works for them - the core is still the same.\\n\r\nMy personal favorites, aside from Romeo, are Francisco (the story's bijin because you know there just had to be at least one) and Curio - Juliet's bodyguards who do indeed lash out at the heroine when she is being fickle (much to my pleasure),  Willy - who is very noteworthy as you can say he depicts the role of Shakespeare and it is this experience that has caused the original tale to come about, and Antonio - Juliet's pint sized, side-kick with a heart of strength and gold.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art in the series is nothing to rave about. It is simply Decent where the main characters are the only ones who get much artistic attention (which is far cry away from being detailed), and people in the background are portrayed with bland outlines and fillings. The backdrop - buildings, landscape and etc...range from Poor to Decent as one would expect much more from a fantasy setting. The color is not as bright and whimsical as it should have been, given its genre and setting, and things do appear painstakingly bland.\\n\\n\r\nThe Music was a disappointment. There is barely, if anything, remarkable about the soundtrack. There is nothing that will captivate and reel you in. There are no tunes that will make you feel the anguish and beauty of love and the character's situation, and there is nothing riveting for moments of battle or dark scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it was quite a chore to sit through 24 episodes of this. Things did not start to get interesting (at least, as interesting as it could get for this series) until about the 10th episode and then it fell yet again. I was very happy when it ended.\\n\r\nIt's important to note that my dislike for the anime has nothing to do with the changes to the original piece - If anything I really enjoyed that much and I honestly think that Shakespeare himself would applaud it as well...this coming from a Shakespeare fanatic. It is poor because it had such great potential, such a talented staff, but it did not follow through.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I went into this anime not expecting to like it very much.  I am not a fan of Shakespeare.  I am also not a fan of plots that showcase war and revenge.  As it turned out, I am, however, a fan of Romeo X Juliet. \r\nThis is NOT your ordinary melodramatic love story.  This is an adventure.\r\nAll of the characters are presented well and integrate with the story seamlessly, allowing this fictional world to brim with life, with living, breathing characters.  Romeo and Juliet are portrayed as strong and brave protagonists that dynamically grow through each episode.  The Capuletsquickly become likable comrades plotting against the Montagues through perfect camaraderie, and this coupled with Romeo and Juliet overcoming regular adversities kept me watching.  You can't help but care for them all.  And the romance isn't sappy, but captivating and without a single blemish in its execution.  Best of all, there are no fillers; each episode is dense with quality content.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the anime might not adhere to Shakespeare's version to the T, but I loved the enhancements: Juliet as a cool Zorro-like figure, Neo Verona set in the skies, and especially the flying pegasus!   The visuals are fantastic, from character design to setting detail and imagination... everything!  Be sure to watch this one on a large screen.  And the opening, with Lena Park's rendition of \"You Raise Me Up\"... a slice of heaven right there.  I wasn't a fan of the ending though, and the more magical aspects of this anime (e.g. the tree near the end) did not seem to fit very well.  \\n\\n\r\nPlease try it.  The first few episodes should be all it takes.",

            "content": "An anime version of Romeo and Juliet? Interesting. \r\nBut its a loose adaptation. Very loose. Don't expect Romeo X Juliet to be like the original Shakespeare play. This review, is written by a person who never read the play but has researched enough about it. Arguably, all the characters in this anime are made differently, unintentionally or not, from their counterparts. And from these traits we get an awfully plentiful disagreeing opinions.\r\nNow for a detailed review...\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe discussion of this part is going to be longer than the others because its the core of the anime, being an \"adaptation.\" Let us begin with the basics;the original Romeo and Juliet is a very romantic tragedy with intense passion and drama of two very young lovers from enemy clans. And undeniably, it could be the most famous love story written, romanticizing love at a very high level. Also, the play has many social and societal issues that are heavy for younger people.\\n\\n\r\nBut, Romeo X Juliet defied the themes of the original by setting a different, lighter mood through a fantasy world. It was not made to adapt the original at all. The given conflict of the Capulet and the Montagues' dispute is briefly introduced to give way to additional plot lines such as oppression of the masses, heroism and coming of age. In context, this anime does not fall short of creativity in interpretation and twists in respect to the Shakespeare's play.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, the heart of the story is the love between Romeo and Juliet- romance. And I can say that made a good job in creating interesting sweet and innocent love story between the two characters through memorable cinematic scenes. It was further made good by many emotional lines and dialogues, both original and quoted from the play itself, that are appropriately romantic.Those wonderful aesthetic qualities combined with the challenges the two must face warms up the interesting and the well-paced story.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, though it has many notable rare qualities, its full of inconsistencies and wasted potential. I repeat, a lot of wasted potential; foreshadowing and the plot itself. Somehow, this anime introduces a lot of unconventional and promising conflicts, especially at the beginning, that disappointingly, unexplored further or left hanging. The Capulet and the Montagues' dispute was rather shallow and offers cliched character involvement which will be elaborated later in the review. Other notable examples could be the new characters, duty and a possible forbidden love.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has a bad habit of introducing something big and exciting, and suddenly replacing it with in-character yet obvious internal conflicts, and gets resolved in a manner that's nothing brilliant. In par with this, many sub-plots have thin links with the main focus of the show. And most probably, the greatest weakness of the anime was the short climax build-up that lacks intensity. And the \"climax\" itself, a poor attempt to adapt the ending of the original, is totally unrelated to the path leading to it. Lastly, there are some important plot devices that makes very little sense at all.\\n\\n\r\nBut one thing makes all of these work: Romeo and Juliet. Their fairy-tale like romance is just so addictive because of its innocent nature. Ideally, they're in love, but in a mature perspective, its an obvious infatuation and a very compatible friendship. Its not intense, passionate and dark but rather the opposite.  And of course, if they're together, they make it look that everything will work out. Well, the series did work out because of them, the anticipation of a different ending is a driving force to finish the series.\\n\\n\r\nPure romance is excellent, everything else that complements it are mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nArtistically, this anime has done very well in dramatizing the themes with an excellent opening. Not only that, as I mentioned, cinematography and the bright mood of lovely scenes made its romance element noteworthy. However, the setting, the clothes, the building designs, appropriate they be, are nothing exceptional or new for they are based of from real life designs, except the pegasus perhaps. Romeo and Juliet's color schemes work well andare memorable. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is another downer. It was inconsistent at most.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song itself \"Inori (You raise me up)\" by Lena Park raised the score of this anime. It was beautiful, intense and well performed and placed in appropriate scenes in different themes. Disappointingly, the endings songs are pale in comparison with it.\\n\\n\r\nBackground music is as inconsistent with the story. It is very touching, light, mellow with Romeo and Juliet scenes and anything concerning romance. It adds up to the feeling of love in many scenes and makes them more memorable. So; the light romantic element itself is again portrayed exceptionally, everything else seems so bland and lacking.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nA Code Geass Review has this line but I guess it will be very appropriate to put it here too:\\n\\n\r\n\"All the world's a stage,\\n\r\nAnd all the men and women merely players;\\n\r\nThey have their exits and their entrances;\\n\r\nAnd one man in his time plays many parts...\" - Shakespeare\\n\\n\r\nWilliam itself is in the anime, a nice caricature. Though he has minimal involvement he his comments are a nice homage and perspective to what what happening. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the anime are different and can be considered \"twisted\" versions of the original. Let us begin with the main protagonists; Romeo and Juliet:\\n\\n\r\nJuliet is probably the true heroine of the story and she is very tradition defying one. She's considerably lacks maturity, evident from her views, actions and emotional responses. Yet, her strength and capabilities in leadership and combat pushes a fairly well development on her side. And being torn between her duty and her feelings for Romeo, the way she overcomes the hurdles of of these internal struggles is something that only few female characters achieved. The used metaphor for actions, also for her love and determination she shared with Romeo, the \"wind\" suits her role in stirring a revolution and going against the odds. She's apparently more level-headed than the original Juliet.\\n\\n\r\nRomeo too, is a very unique prince, because his role of a child of an influencial/evil person, a kindhearted noble who advocates reform, well mannered, naive and innocent nature are the usual stereotypes for lead heroines: That's right, mainly princesses. But he fitted his role well and it's in tandem with his idealism and pure, young love for Juliet. And amazingly,none of these traits badly affect his male protagonist image, but rather it makes him more lovable and adorable. On the other hand, the real Romeo is impulsive, violent and too passionate according to some sources.\\n\\n\r\nRomance worked out very well between the two, but again, mostly everything else is utterly mediocre. One big flaw is the lack of intense reaction from the other characters regarding RXJ love. It should be outrageous, scandalous, disappointing, shocking- all kinds of emotions to further juxtapose love. But all the characters are lacking in that area so the challenges RxJ face aren't romantic in nature themselves but rather situational or societal. Personal issues are always defeated by love. And like what I explained earlier, those conflicts have wasted big potentials.\\n\\n\r\nThe best example of poor character involvement is the repetitive \"Montagues are evil\" and \"The Capulets must be destroyed.\" And the reason for that? Cliches...\\n\\n\r\nThrough all those negative attributes, the side characters are not that bad at all. There is the presence of nice best friends like Benvolio and Cordelia. Loyal protector with interesting little secrets and personalities like Curio and Francisco are very likable. The cast from the original play is certainly \"animated\" here, as alternate persons. Although the background people are decent enough, some of them made no contribution to the overall drama; just creating additional insignificant situations.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nThis is very opinionated and based on my preference; I had high hopes for this series but I was very disappointed. But I can say that I did enjoy it, especially the lovely scenes between RxJ. It succeeds in making the audience experience the kind of love that is shared between the two. I makes people \"fall in love.\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n",

For example... flying horses?\r\nThe story is extremely well played out. The only reason why I didnt rate the story any higher was that sometimes, the fantasy elements were too much, and didnt always fit in *spoiler* (Escalus). Only at the very end do all the elements fit together. Although almost everyone knows how a Romeoand Juliet story should end, you cant help but anticipate what twist Gonzo will throw in. Most of the story's details are different from the original, but all the underlying themes are there.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful. The character designs are different from commonplace anime designs, and the backgrounds are amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is amazing. The opening theme suits the anime very well. The insert song in episode 7 was AMAZINGLY placed and well done... brought me to tears. The ending songs are also good, but at first they dont seem to fit. But as you sit and listen to it and think about the episode.. it just feels right.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the characters the most in this series. One thing I didnt like about the original story was the love between Romeo and Juliet. It seemed more like infatuation, and there was no development of love between them. In this adaptation. there is actually love. You see the characters struggle and love each other so much. Actually, I havent seen such good relationship development in anime for a while (and this includes romance animes). The other characters, although almost all of them have a different role, all fit their new roles very well. \\n\\n\r\nI found this series extremely enjoyable and definitely recommend it to any anime viewer who enjoys adaptations, and a clean anime full of love and struggle.\\n",

            "content": "Added new depth to the classic William Shakespeare tail Romeo and Juliet.\r\nI had a few doubt going into this series, but my misgivings were quickly put to rest, I thought it might turn out like the Leonardo DiCaprio movie Romeo and Juliet, the movie was pretty bad. Thankfully the anime series is a whole lot better.\r\nRomeo X Juliet is a extraordinary anime series. There is the same story of two waring families, and the two children from the families falling in love. There are so many things that make this a great anime series. First the story, sure there's the same classic story, but GONZOadded much more and new twists to the story. The world the anime series takes place in is wonderful. A mysterious land floating in the sky, winged horese, and of course the Tree called Escalus. The mystery behind the floating land is the real story. The love story, between Romeo and Juliet is just a added benefit.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were also amazing. GONZO brought many changes to them, adding more life to them than in the classic play. Characters from Lady Portia(Romeo's Mother), William, Ophelia, and many more.\\n\\n\r\nNext is the music, which is excellent on par with Fullmetal Alchemist, but a notch below Cowboy Bebop.\\n\\n\r\nFinally the animation is done by GONZO. The did a stunning job with Romeo X Juliet, it just amazes me how good a job they do.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Romeo and Juliet is a classic anime series, and is in my top 5 anime series I've seen",

            "content": "When i first saw the title, i though it would be quite a cliche anime since the story itself is quite well known. But i must applaud the effort put in by the studio in adding a lot of extra detail while still being able to maintain the original storyline. Myself being a fantasy lover was immediately taken in by the flying horses and mythical tree. I think that they made the story more interesting and enhanced the mood,especially the drama in the show. So in terms of the story it was quite well done in my opinion and should not be taken lightly becauseof its title.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was fairly good, although i don't pay that much attention to the artwork,there were certainly no noticeable flaws in the animeand the characters were drawn quite well.\\n\\n\r\nThe Songs in the show were quite an interesting selection. The opening was a surprise to me in that i never imagined there would be japanese version of the song &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot;, but it fitted well with the anime. The ending was more upbeat then the opening which i squite different from your usual anime but i guess i dont detest it since its something different fro a change. The inserts of the english version of the opening helps to enhance the mood in the story and her voice is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters is of course what makes the story so great.However, in this anime too much focus is on the main characters and the supporting characters do not get much showtime, so it is a bit onesided. But they still used the supporting character well to create the setting i shant spoil it.It is also interesting to see William in the anime acting as if the story actually originated from this anime and his presence is another interesting feature of this anime\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime because i myself am a romance-drama anime fan. But i found it different from the original shakespeare version and it draws me in. The conflict and burden of the names that the two must carry draws in the audience and the ending is somewhat satisfying even though it is meant to be a tragedy, it was portrayed in a manner that seems like a happy ending which is good because i hate those open endings.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is a good anime worth watching and should not be judged based on its title, i hope this was helpful to whoever reads it, its only my first review though.",

            "content": "In a word: disappointing.  The early episodes showed the potential to be an exciting and imaginative spin on an old classic; but it wound up being dragged down by serious pacing problems and a plot that was all over the place. There were too many things that seemed to happen for no particular reason other than they needed a dramatic plot development at that moment. \r\nSometimes a mediocre story can be saved by the characters.  The characters in this series are likeable enough and several have the potential to be interesting, but most of the time their development is too lacking or rushedto be satisfying.  Particularly frustrating is Juliet herself, whom they try to present as a 'strong and spirited heroine' through the old shoujo shorthand of having her dress as a boy and swing a sword around; but she always seems to forget how to use it and trip over her own feet any time Romeo, Curio, Tybalt, or any other guy needs to dramatically come to her rescue.\\n\\n\r\nEven as simple eye candy, the show doesn't quite measure up.  Although the character and environment designs are gorgeous, the animation is inconsistent from episode to episode.  (Also, if you're going to have flying horses as a major element in a series, you'd better make sure you have the budget to animate them decently!)",

            "content": "\"Just another adaptation of one of Shakespeare's most popular plays. Boring.\" This was more or less what I thought when I stumbled upon Romeo x Juliet a while ago. One look at the opening credits of this anime suggested that I may have judged it too hastily, and 24 episodes later I knew I was definitely wrong.\r\nIt's a difficult task to improve upon the original story of Romeo and Juliet, a tremendous tale full of romance and tragedy. This anime adaptation pays a lot of respect to Shakespeare's famous work, and yet also manages to throw in so much of it's own ideas. Unlike the1996 American film adaptation which was set in modern-day Verona, the anime changes the setting to Neo Verona, an aerial continent. Incorporated into this new fantasy setting are elements such as dragon steeds and enchanted trees. Rather than having two warring families on equal grounds, the anime instead depicts the Montagues as the dominant family, who force the Capulets into hiding for several years. The main theme of the story remains the same, with an ill-fated love between Romeo and Juliet accompanied by a rebellion by the Capulets towards the Montagues. However, the anime also includes many action scenes which gives the series plenty of energy and excitement. No matter how much one wishes against it though, the anime stays true to its roots and provides a tearjerker of an ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Romeo x Juliet is excellent during the first half of the series, but unfortunately there is a dip in quality during the second half. The character models are simple but effective, whereas the city of Neo Verona is shown in great detail and full of vibrant colours. The action sequences are also well animated.\\n\\n\r\nThe musical score supports this anime very well, and most of the tracks are used at the most suitable moments to create uplifting, dramatic, or sad atmospheres. The narrative is also superb, keeping in tone with Shakespeare's original play by including lines which use an older style of English as well as many of his quotes. The opening song (Inori ~ You Raise Me Up) is extremely soothing and fits the overall theme of the story perfectly. However, the first ending song doesn't suit this anime at all, whereas the second ending is fairly average when compared to the opening.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Romeo x Juliet don't disappoint either, and a lot of them feel like a breath of fresh air to the story. If you've seen or read the original play, forget what you already know about Mercutio and Tybalt, because they (among a few others) have different backgrounds and personalities. There are quite a number of new characters introduced, including one who is basically Shakespeare himself! The side characters are interesting to a certain extent in their own little ways, and provide decent support to the main leads. Surprisingly, the background of Romeo\u2019s father is explored in quite a bit of detail, which partly helps to explain why he acts like a tyrant. Then we come to Romeo and Juliet, who as expected get the most screentime and development out of the whole cast. The length of the series allows it to take the time to develop each of the two main leads individually and thoroughly; Romeo has a strong desire to help others despite a lack of affection from his tyrannical father, whereas Juliet masquerading as a hero of justice is a great idea and provides another dimension to her character (she can handle a sword just as well as anyone in this show). The chemistry between the two feels very realistic and heartwarming, and never too cheesy. \\n\\n\r\nRomeo x Juliet is a great series to watch, feeling familiar yet new at the same time. The main part of Shakespeare's play is still here, but there are so many other aspects to it too. The pacing of the story slows down a little during the middle section (due to the two leads embarking on their own separate adventures for a while), but any other flaws aren't noticeable enough to detract from the enjoyment too much. Definitely recommended.\\n",

            "content": "I figured that I should write my first review with one of my favorite stories I've ever seen/read. Romeo x Juliet is one of the most romantic and tragic anime ever because it's derived from Shakespeare's play, Romeo and Juliet, duh. But the anime's story is a little bit different than Shakespeare's, with the addition of mythical creatures and magic to add even more drama into an already dramatic story. \r\nStory: The love story between Romeo Candorebanto Montague and Juliet Fiammata Asto Capulet. But instead of their parents being enemies and forbidding their love, the Montague family killed the entire Capulet family, except forJuliet who grows up to be the people's hero of justice, \"Red Whirlwind\". Meanwhile, the Montague family is a tyranny, and cruel to the people, therefore making them Juliet's opponent. And in the midst of a rebellion, Romeo and Juliet's destinies cross, and the all so romantic and tragic love story between Romeo and Juliet begins. I loved the anime version as much as I did the original play, and I LOVED the original play! There were moments... No, the entire anime was tugging at my feelings, there were many scenes where I couldn't help but cry soo much!!\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was the same as your typical anime made around 2007, not clear and beautiful, but a more realistic looking art. The characters were designed just the way I had imagined them when I read Romeo and Juliet. I loved the quiet symbolism of poison, roses and beautiful angelic wings. \\n\\n\r\nSound: This was amazing! Romeo and Juliet had the perfect voice cast for them! The music certainly made all the sad moments in Romeo and Juliet even sadder! The song, \"You Raise Me Up\" was beautiful and tear-jerking! Oh my goodness when it played at the end of the anime, I cried soo much!!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: A large variety of characters that could have been developed a bit more, or gotten a bit more screen time. But, there's my 2 favorites characters Romeo and Juliet, and that is enough for me. The romance and tragic level between Romeo and Juliet destroys my heart everytime I watch/read about them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed it so much, and I cried so much watching this anime. The anime isn't the same as the Shakespeare play. Romeo x Juliet has more mythical creatures and overdramatic sad scenes that grasps the attention of the audience more than Shakespeare's original play. Romeo x Juliet is definitely one of the greatest romance stories ever, and one of my favorite stories ever! Everyone must watch or read Romeo x Juliet!",

            "content": "SOUND/SONG/OP AND ED SONG...\r\nThe OP song of this anime is very suitable for the theme of the love story of Romeo and Juliet. I don't think any other music would perfectly fit this very emotional and somehow classic anime.\r\nHowever, the ED song for the first half of the anime is a rock/loud music, contrasting to its OP song, and it's not that suitable. However, I cannot totally judge this song because I never tried to listen to it completely. The second ED song is, i think, more suitable, because it has a nice melody, and the meaning of the song fits the story.\r\nART/ANIMATION:\r\nThe flying horsesthere are not consistent in terms of art and animation. However, the art/animation is not that bad and the characters were drawn well, and the conservativeness of the story is seen in the art of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\nI haven't read Romeo and Juliet, so this review is not that dependable to those who read it. But the way the story was put in the anime is very nice because even my little sister, who doesn't love serious romance animes, watched it and was very touched and very affected by it. The end is unpredictable, but because this story is famous for its tragic end, you would really want it to end the other way. You would want to have something, a sort of a miracle, to twist its story, because you feel you're a part of it, you feel like you're going to be greatly affected if it would end tragically, if it would end the original way.\\n\r\nEvery end of an episode keeps you hanging and asking for more. However, on the 22nd/23rd episode, you would want to end it there.\\n\r\nThe original story is translated in a nice way, because I understood the gist of the story.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nI liked the the way they retained the names of the characters.\\n\r\nAs of their roles, I found Juliet strong, but becomes weak when it comes to love, and is very indecisive when her love for Romeo will be greatly affected with her decision.\\n\r\nRomeo is the perfect guy a girl can have, as presented in this anime.\\n\r\nThe antagonists are effective antagonists because they can make you angry and pity the protagonists.\\n\r\nAbout the supporting characters, I think they supported the main characters well.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION/OVERALL:\\n\r\nThis is a very nice and classic romance anime, and it will keep you asking for more of it. You know, I didn't plan on writing a review for this, but after I finished watching it, I was greatly affected, even though 2 days passed by already. It's still fresh on my mind...\\n\r\nYou must watch this anime if you want simple and sweet romance love stories, without the Ecchiness, and with just pure feelings... ^_^",

            "content": "***This is a Spoiler-Free Review***\r\nAlright, for better or worse, shelve what you know about Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet, this anime is a fantasy-action and romance story loosely *inspired* by the timeless play, not quite an adaptation.  If that doesn't sound appealing or you were expecting Romeo & Juliet: the Noh Drama / [High School] Musical, you may leave.  The rest of you...have a seat.\r\nStory [6/10] - It should go without spoiling anything that the focus of the story is our hero Romeo and our heroine Juliet falling in love and the events that transpire before and as a result of this.  Towardsthe beginning of the anime, the creative liberties taken and new characters introduced are refreshing, exciting, and it's great to see the lens focused with Juliet as the main character.  The fantasy-like setting is fun.  It starts out having a great mix of the romance, gripping backstory, action, and character development.  Some shows use that momentum and ultimately finish out strong...but Romeo X Juliet sadly is not one of them.  Had the second half been as good as the first half this score would be much higher.  But if you appreciate good plot with an equally strong resolution rather than anime cliches, you like me will have an imprint of your face on your palm by the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation [5/10] - Oh boy.  At TIMES the art an animation quality are outstanding.  R x J is sometimes here, sometimes there.  Sometimes there are beautiful backgrounds with well drawn characters (the very beginning and very end are good examples), and at other times characters proportions, ESPECIALLY faces get completely screwed up the moment the character simply turns their head to face a different direction.  In one episode, I thought to myself \"they must have spent all the money for this episode on animating Juliet in that scene, because in this next scene Francisco's nose isn't on right...\" I always try to look at animation in perspective of when it was made, and at times R x J has the animation production value of a show made in 2001.  Gonzo and GK are both at fault here, because Gonzo is guilty of this in the past, and we all know they could have been better than that comparing to some of their other titles (even \"moeblob\" titles).\\n\\n\r\nSound (OST, OP/ED, Acting) [9/10] - \\n\\n\r\nThe OST is the true gem of this title.  Whether or not you ever watch this show, you owe it to yourself to listen to if not OWN this soundtrack.  Sakimoto-sensei is a man of exceptional talent, compared often to Uematsu Nobuo even though their styles are pretty different (probably by association to Final Fantasy, as his other famous work is the OST to FFXII).  The often fully-orchestrated tracks bring an unbelievable amount of live into the characters, at times almost TOO much.  But in this case, can't have too much of a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is also fabulous, naturally pretty much a cover of \"You Raise Me Up\", but Korean-born Lena Park sings it with vigor and when she hits the high notes, the timbre and beauty of her voice really shine.  Excellent staffing choice there.  The EDs are enjoyable enough to listen to, the 2nd more than the 1st, but are overall pretty forgetable.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the voice acting.  Well I'll just say... Gonzo sure as heck saved money in this department.  They probably spent most of their budget on Sakimoto-sensei.  The female seiyuu are composed of a lot of unknown talents, and some of the best seiyuu in the production (Iwao Junko, Saito Chiwa) play very minor roles.  The male seiyuu do a little better save for one gripe.  Those who pay attention to the \"acting\" part of voice acting may agree with me, but it takes true grit to put up with Romeo's voice for 24 episodes (let alone Mizushima-san's voice in general but that is an opinionated digression not suited for this review).  That aside the award for best role in the show goes to Ishii Kouji for his roles as Montague.  Truly brings out, and makes you hate, the character which brings me to my next section...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [6/10] - At the beginning of the show, this really is around an 8 or a 9.  The anime-original characters are very welcome, and whether or not you agree with the roles chosen for some similarly named characters from the play, the backstory of characters such as Tybalt are well written.  Montague especially seems to be the perfect villain in the beginning, and continues to be through the later half.  However...all semblance of character development seems to crumble in the last few episodes.  You feel as if you are watching one of Willy's plays, because if you, even based on the anime alone, sit and think \"what would the characters I have come to learn so much about over these past 20 episodes do in this kind of situation?\" you'd be surprised at how contrary their actions seem, as if they are puppets in a play...or victims of poor writing on the staff's part.  Some characters are completely forgotten, whilst others are simply assigned stereotypical \"roles\" which completely overwrite their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [7/10] - On the whole a fairly enjoyable title.  The ups generally outweigh the downs and if you're looking for fantasy-romance, you can do worse than R x J.  Some of the well written parts make the show worth seeing on the whole, and the incorporation of the OST as well as some of the \"new\" or \"refreshed\" characters give this title life differentiated from the Shakespeare play.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (not an average) [7/10] - Based on the ANN Rating System \"Good, worth seeing\" Naturally there are negatives, the art and animation being the primary factor, and the somewhat rushed writing towards the end of the anime. But on the positive, the refreshed setting, new characters, and most of the character development make it worth the ride and some scenes may even be worth a rewatch.  Like a good coaster, you will enjoy most of the ride, you just might get gas pains afterwards from that chili you ate before.\\n\\n\r\nRewatch Value: Low",

            "content": "As an English Major in University, I would be the first to say that Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is far from the masterpiece many think it is. \r\nThe original play is rushed, unbelievable and ultimately the characters themselves are most at fault. Romeo and Juliet are nothing more than lovestruck teenagers, who cannot stop thinking about their libido long enough for the play not to end in tragedy. That being said, Romeo x Juliet is an inventive interpretation of one of the worlds most famously known plays. \r\nStory:\r\nThe story of Romeo x Juliet, is thankfully, a pretty big departure from the original. Adding in aflair of fantasy while keeping the true essence of what Shakespeare was supposedly trying to achieve in telling a tragic love story. What falls flat ultimately though is the pacing of the story and parts of its presentation. The introduction of Escalus and Juliet's true destiny should have been introduced much sooner, as well as a lot of the development that worked to make the love between them more realistic broke the pace of what could have been a true masterpiece. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI quite liked the art of this adaption, the contrasting images of Montague Blue and Capulet Red was nice along with the bright colours and flowers that populated Neo Verona. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nWhen I first heard the intro song I was off put by how familiar it was. It wasn't long until I realized it was a cover of You Raise Me Up,  and while at first I wasn't too fond of it, I'm not too fond with most versions of it to be fair, it grew on me and ultimately fit well with the story. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters of Shakespeare's play are ultimately its downfall. Romeo and Juliet are basically moronic teenagers who get themselves killed, while it may be romantic, the pacing would show that it was nothing more than momentary lust and you lose a lot of the sense of tragedy or romance that would normally be perceived. Romeo x Juliet does a lot to alleviate this, however it still falls short. Romeo is honestly a bore and Juliet is the clich\u00e9d mold of a anime heroine, but both are huge steps in the right direction in comparison to Shakespeare's version. The twists that were added to such characters like Tybalt and Mercutio were wonderful delights and if only all were utilized in such a fashion this could have been so much more. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nLike I stated before I am an English Major in University, so coming across Shakespeare's work is pretty much unavoidable. I've never been much of a fan, but do enjoy some of his plays, unfortunately Romeo and Juliet is not one of them. After having to recently right an essay on it, I remembered this adaptation and low and behold, honestly and truly loved it. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nExcept for a few misteps, this is definitely an anime worth watching. If you know the original at all, it is almost a crime not to watch this just to see it in a different light. I give this anime 8/10.",

            "content": "Okay, lets start off with saying that everyone knows Shakespeare' s Romeo and Juliet. It's a well established play and movies have followed (with one coming soon). So when I came in to watch this anime I thought I knew what I was going into. The same old same old, right?\r\nWrong. \r\nRomeo x Juliet tell the tale of two lovers named Romeo and Juliet but that's as far as the relevance to the play goes. In this version there's pegasi, evil Dukes, magic trees, long lost relatives and a rebel fighter. Sounds appetizing right? Wrong again. Romeo x Juliet has been one of the mostboring and agonizing anime adventures I have had.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10 - I have to say that Gonzo were creative with changing the story to a well known topic. They did it in such a way where even though you think you know the outcome, you second guess yourself and then third guess. I was surprised with the plot during most of the anime. Though, at times I was let down by the randomness and the loose wires left laying around. Sometimes I found myself thinking that some scenes were unnecessary to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10 - I wasn't a big fan of the character art but the scenery was spectacular. The buildings really were drawn in the style of Italy in the Middle Ages. The flowers were also well drawn and easily distinguishable. There isn't really much to talk about the art, it was good.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10 - The best aspect of the anime by far. The OP (which is a Japanese version of You Raise Me Up) sounded so beautiful and I always looked forward to listening to it. The ED during the first half was also really good, it was more of an upbeat song which suited the anime. The ED during the second half wasn't as good but it suited the more serious phase the anime was entering. The background music was always well timed and set the mood.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10 - BOOM and the anime just explodes at this point. The characters were terrible. If this was based off Shakespeare' s Romeo and Juliet, couldn't some characters at least remained the same? My favourite character, Mercutio, was crumbled and desrroyed. That aside, lets say for originality purposes. Then there's the way characters were made to seem unnecessarily evil. They had evil cackles, the eyes, the terrible lines and altogether seemed over the top and unnatural. Duke Montague was portrayed awfully and so was the Friar. Many characters from the play didn't even make an appearance, for originality again maybe? And don't even get me started on Romeo and Juliet. Romeo seemed so emotionless at so many scenes and too emotional at some. He was shown as an ignorant child (which I guess he was so they did something right). Juliet as the Red Whirlwind was one of the most kickass characters but as soon as she took off that mask, she became an underdeveloped and wimp-like character. The only decent characters which stopped me from giving this section a 0 was Tybalt (and his muscly arms), Antonio, Francisco and a bit of Benvolio.\\n\\n\r\nOverall,  I give this anime a 5/10. Through the first half of the anime I found myself completely dull with no emotions towards the anime. As the anime continued, I found myself wanting to hurry up and finish it so I could write this review. It wasn't a waste of time because I now appreciate Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet a lot more. The occasional quotes from the play were a treat and I do admit some scenes were cute. Yet, I wouldn't recommed this to many but if you wouldn't mind having the flower power 'peace man' quota being thrown around, go ahead and give this a shot. I definitely don't want to be rewatching this.",

            "content": "I was recommended RomeoxJuliet as \"something to poke fun at.\" For the first three episodes, I felt pained by how bad it felt and really did just poke fun at it. But when I went back to it, I realized that it was \"funny\" in and only in that it was how I was expecting it. Also, the script in the first few episodes is a bit jolty in its wording from modern to archaic and back. That levels out pretty soon, and is very smooth and beautiful. Sub and Dub are both done quite well, and I do believe that Chris Burnett as Romeodid the least cheesy \"No!\" I have ever heard. \\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, it is solid. There were a couple of plotholes here and there like just about any story, but for the most part it flowed quite well. Escalus is brought in smoothly, even though it's kind of like \"okay. tree. your point?\" at first. But it is incorporated well, even though it doesn't come in until halfway through the series. \\n\\n\r\nMy only complaints are the Red Whirlwind and the color-coding. I know that color-coding is common in anime, but RomeoxJuliet seemed to take it to an extreme that it became a plothole. I get the hair matching the coat-of-arms, but the clothing, the cloaks, the swords, the eyes? It got a smidgen ridiculous. As for the Red Whirlwind, how come no one could guess it was Juliet? No one else would wear that much pink. And the fact that the Red Whirlwind looks like a pink Zorro did not help in taking-this-seriously factor.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, wow, where to begin. It would be easier to list who I didn't like, because that list is so much smaller. All the characters had depth. Romeo, Juliet, Francisco, Curio, Tybalt, even Benvolio had a level of depth in his quirks and maturing. Romeo and Juliet's love and attraction grows quite beautifully and smoothly. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this quite a bit. If you want a beautiful, well-done, sappy story, I'd suggest trying RomeoxJuliet. Also, it does not have a violence and profanity level worth of the R rating MAL gives it. While a bit of gore and violence is defintiely present, there is nothing being severed, and most blood is all post-act.",

            "content": "Ah, Romeo and Juliet. Probably the most enduring love story of all time. The story of passionate young star crossed lovers, in passionate searing love, falling into the hands of an impossibly tragic fate in order to teach their quarreling families and the audience a lesson about innocence in the midst of violence and hatred. Lovely and stirring and compelling, right? I sure think so. So being the really really pathetic Shakespeare nerd that I am....and a huge fan of anime I thought to myself, \"ROMEO AND JULIET IN AN ANIME????\" *nerdgasm* \"I MUST SEE THIS\".\r\nbut\r\nafter seeing it, all I could think was \"poo.\"\r\nSTORY\r\nThis anime,despite it's lovely name and main characters named after the protagonists of Shakespeare's masterpiece, is absolutely NOT the classic \"Romeo and Juliet\" that I was expecting....and wished that the anime delivered. Don't get me wrong. The fact that they changed the story...or wrote an entirely different story stickered with the name of Romeo X Juliet...though unexpected, did not soil my opinion of the anime. In fact, the main premise of the story was very compelling and some aspects of it were good. Very good in fact. BUT OH. the tragedy of this take on Romeo and Juliet was not in the story. It was in the writing. So much potential to be a good series! So many ways that the story could have succeeded! Oh how I flinched while I watched this series as each and every good thing this series had going for it turned to dust with each completely unnecessary arc to enter into the story. Simplicity is beautiful. I wish the writers knew this. So instead of witnessing the achingly pure innocent love story that is at the very heart of Romeo and Juliet...and this series...the love story aspect gets bogged down and diminished by all of the extra unneeded overly angsty arcs that begin to clutter up the last 1/3 of the series. I'm not saying that this series was not a \"romance\" series. It was very \"romantic\". It had all the cheesy lines and the cutesy couple scenes. But that isn't what Romeo and Juliet is all about! IT'S ABOUT PASSION. But the romance in this series was...bland.  Romeo and Juliet, oh Romeo and Juliet where for art thou romantic beautiful version of Romeo and Juliet?? *cries* \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI actually enjoyed the artistic aspect of this series quite a bit. Yes, the animation was not top-notch. at all. But the soft tones and muted pastelly well detailed backgrounds really were pretty. They almost made me feel as if I were watching a fairy tale. The character designs were nice too. I really loved the innocent boyishness of Romeo's appearance and Juliet was not the fickle little thing that she normally gets portrayed as. Overall, the art was not the most disappointing part of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe music for this series is lovely. It's frilly and fantastical and it matches the tone of the series perfectly. Not perfect, but nice. I really love the song \"you raise me up\" which the series adapted as its themesong. SO ROMANTIC. too bad it was probably the most romantic part of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThank goodness the characters in the series were awesome. Otherwise my score for it would've ended up a lot lower. But the characters really make this series. I loved that Juliet was not portrayed as a weak fickle damsel. Not only is she super strong and courageous, she's a freaking super hero! That rocks. I also liked how Romeo was portrayed. He wasn't the little hormonal whiny sop that he normally is portrayed as...instead, he's level headed and rational and strong. I dig that. The supporting characters, although MUCH less developed, were likable and enjoyable to watch as well. Each one plays a role in the story and makes the viewer have a deeper interest in what was going in the series. Even if the story was not perfect, the characters carried it quite well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall\\n\r\nWas this series Romeo and Juliet, the masterpiece, the tragic tale of passion and love?? Definitely not. But this series was not terrible either. It was, for the most part intriguing and enjoyable. As long as you don't mind A LOT of revisions to the original story and messy somewhat disappointing writing, I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy it.",

The villains (the duke and his guard/carabineri) are just so terribly one-dimensional and evil, it just makes zero sense and causes me to get angry every time they say/do something. All of their actions are simply just pure evil for the sole purpose of being evil without any reason whatsoever. Case in point: when they go looking for Romeo, who has disappeared without reason, they learn hepassed through some village. So what do the carabineri do? They take all of the villagers as prisoners, and start BURNING DOWN THEIR HOUSES - just because Romeo happened to pass though the village at some point before. WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL? Throughout the whole show, the Duke and his guards/carabineri treat all other people in such a despicable and evil way, it just makes no sense to me ... these are supposed to be their subjects, they have committed no crimes, and suddenly the big masters come and start shitting on them for no logical reason whatsoever.\\n\r\nThis kept happening over and over in the show to the point where I could no longer tolerate it and just dropped it because it got way too ridiculous in the way of the villains being just plain evil and one-dimensional.",

I have to admit I was skeptical when I first saw it but I finally decided to watch a few months later after seeing the trailer (which is seriously epic. Probably the best trailer for anything I've ever seen). That, was an excellent decision.\r\nSTORY:\r\nNot the well known Shakespeare story. No useless battles, idiotic butlers and no hormonal teenagers (Well, actually, no. They're the main characters. But they're a lot less hormonal.) If you didn't take the time to read the summary above, I suggest you do. Bothhappy and sad (Yeah, I cried), the story really is great. Rating: 9/10\\n\r\nART: \\n\r\nThe art is actually pretty good. Neo Verona is beautiful (I kinda want to move there) and the people are all animated quite well. If you're a fan of Gonzo's other work, you'll like this one. Rating: 9/10\\n\r\nSOUND: \\n\r\nThe music isn't a masterpiece but it does just fine. The real \"WOW!\" comes from the voices. This is one of those rare occasions I actually like the English dub cast better than the original Japanese. Juliet is played amazingly by Brina Palencia (Hell Girl, One Piece, Evaneglion) and Romeo is played by the not very well known Chris Burnett (Bamboo Blade, Big Windup!, Itsudatte My Santa!) This was the first role I ever heard him in and I absolutely fell in love with his voice. It's amazing. The supporting roles are also played well. William (J. Micheal Tatum) and Benvolio (Sean Micheal Teague) are played perfectly. Also, the script was really good. They could be a little more creative than the Japanese version with fitting in Shakespeare quotes. Rating: 9/10\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nI really like the characters, especially Juliet. She's really strong and independent without coming off as a tsundere character. Romeo is equally good, being sensitive and naive but strong at the same time. The supporting characters are also really great and add a lot to the story. (I absolutely love the little Curio x Francisco x Juliet backstory!) Rating: 10/10\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nA really enjoyable series, especially for Shakespeare and history fans. But overall, an AMAZING show! Overall Rating: 10/10",

This is a good show underestimated.\r\nI wasn't very excited to watch a show about Romeo and Juliet because I'm not too much into romance and drama. The romance on this show was not the dominant hero. It went side by side with a much greater cause.\r\nFirst, as a person who studied English literature in college, this was a big treat. Imagine having a mash-up of Shakespeare's characters in one place. This is Romeo x Juliet. We even have Shakespeare himself.\r\nThe creation of Neo Verona gave the story a new depth and flavor. The conflict isnot about merely a teenage couple but it the struggle of a nation. The topic of the star-crossed lovers is accentuated. It does not follow the original plot per se so it leaves you wondering what will happen next. It is also fun to try and recognise which character if from which other play by Shakespeare. It is a choice of stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nOne more personal bonus for me was the first ending song. It's so beautiful and sad despite the upbeat music. It has a sense of nostalgia and something in it just tears my heart.\\n\\n\r\nstory: 9\\n\r\nart: 8\\n\r\nsound:9\\n\r\ncharacter: 8\\n\r\nenjoyment: 9",

            "content": "This was a struggle for me to plow through and definitely among one of Gonzo's weaker efforts. Romeo x Juliet attempts to go for a more fantasy-based approach to Shakespeare's tragic love story of feuding families and teens in love. Instead though, this series takes far too many liberties with the source material where it completely alters the basic concepts of the original play's storytelling. Rather than the Capulets and Montagues having a rivalry with one another and both sides shown to be in the wrong for their conflict, Romeo x Juliet depicts a black-and-white storyline with the Capulets being the \"good\" side and theMontagues being the \"bad\" side (done enough times), with the former being mostly killed off and the latter ruling the kingdom of Neo Verona with an iron fist. Whatever remnants there are of the Capulet family are leading a resistance movement against the Montagues' tyranny (name enough anime titles that pull this off) with Juliet unwillingly being the leader of said movement, especially as she comes to gain a love interest in Montague family heir Romeo.\\n\\n\r\nMy snarking in the parenthesis of the previous paragraph should clue you in what makes this take on Shakespeare's classic a major issue for me. It relies so heavily on cliches for its plot and character developments, that it's laughable. Romeo's the idealistic and courageous young boy, Lord Montague the merciless and power-hungry ruler, Tybalt the revenge-seeking loner, Mercutio the opportunistic power-snagger, and so forth. Basically, mostly everyone in the series is tacked on with an archetype and they don't really develop very much out of it. In addition, the characters tend to make very illogical decisions in many instances that the series tries playing up as dramatic yet come across more ridiculous, especially in the finale of the series. Only character I really found myself caring for was \"Willy\", whose foppish and flamboyant take on William Shakespeare provided some humor and sanity for me in this mess of a series.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals were decent for the most part with vivid color and a good amount of visual detail applied for scenery and character designs. Action scenes were somewhat engaging with the implementation of Dragon Steeds used for travel and engaging into battles, though animation wasn't a major element in their use since many such scenes were flourishes and weren't relying on regular animation shortcuts. The dramatic musical score for the series is nice to listen to featuring orchestral pieces and a nice ballad from Korean singer Lena Park for an OP and insert song, though are quite overwhelming in their implementation at points during key scenes in the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found Romeo x Juliet to be quite underwhelming. The anime tries being dramatic in its take on Shakespeare's tragic work, but takes too many liberties with its source material and dabbles into too many cliches to be a unique work compared to Gonzo's earlier effort with Gankutsuou. Definitely don't waste any time with this one.",

            "content": "Have you ever seen Romeo and Juliet? It\u2019s a really popular play written by William Shakespeare. Countless variations of the play have been adapted in different mediums. Movie, book, TV Series, Anime. You name it, they have it. It\u2019s considered by many as probably the best romance story in all of literature. But does it live up to the hype? Is it really THAT good? Is it worth watching when I already know what will happen in the end? If this is a Q&A, I would\u2019ve easily answered that, but this is a review so just find out as you read along. Romeo x Juliet:a tragic tale of love and revenge. Is it truly love that can never be?\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\n\tRomeo x Juliet like its origin, Romeo and Juliet is a true masterpiece. Not only that it tells the beautiful story of love and revenge, but there\u2019s also a fantasy twist which will just make things much more interesting. Having seen Romeo and Juliet plays for about three times now, I always felt that there is something missing. The original story feels somewhat 1D in comparison to the \u201cremake\u201d though I will never say that one is better than the other. They\u2019re both good in their own ways but it feels like adding something new to the story makes it standout even more. I don\u2019t know. Maybe I was just tired of seeing the same old story over and over again so when a bit of a fantasy element was added, I enjoyed it a lot better. The title in it of itself is enough reason for you to watch this show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\n\tThough the series mainly focuses on Romeo and Juliet, it is not right to say that the supporting cast is not that good. You\u2019ll either hate them (Lady Hermoine and King Montague) or love them (William Shakespeare appears in his own creation. lol.) but they are made for you to do so. You\u2019ll hate a character because they were made to be hated. It like professional wrestling: Heels (Chris Jericho is the natural heel in my book) are made to be hated while Faces (Super John Cena) are made to be cheered for. Now, with the supporting cast out of the way, let\u2019s talk about the 2 characters that gave the series its name: Romeo and Juliet.\\n\\n\r\n\tAt first, we have Juliet Fiammata Asto Capulet (No google. Fuck yes!) who is not your typical damsel in distress. Throughout the series, Juliet is always fighting. Not just for herself, but for everything as well. As Odin, her \u201csuperhero\u201d alter ego, she fights the system for the right of every citizen of Neo Verona. While as Juliet, the rightful heir to the throne of de Capulete, she fights not only for her right for the throne, but for her love as well. In the course of 24 episodes, Romeo and Juliet had too little screen time together because they we\u2019re always apart. This in turn made Juliet a little weaker but not helpless. She is a fighter down to her core. Shows a feminine side often but produces testosterone higher than even Simon, the personification of testosterone (in my book) himself. Okay, that\u2019s enough. lol. What I\u2019m trying to say is that, she may be a damsel in distress but she is definitely not that helpless. She\u2019s just madly in love with Mr. Perfect, Curt Hennig, I mean Romeo.\\n\\n\r\n\tThen, we have Romeo Candorebanto Montague (I googled that! Fuck yes!), a noble gentleman (Like yours truly) who died a virgin (Like you. Haha, burn! Just kidding! lol. )\u2026 Or did he? I think. Probably. Lesson? Be a gentleman but never abandon your perverted side. Be like me, I mean like Sanji. He\u2019s a good example. lol. Anyway, back on topic. He, like me (*grins*), treats women really good (right Hermoine? *winks*) and does anything for the one he loves (aka. Andres de Saya. It\u2019s an expression in my country. Send me a PM or comment if you want to know what that means. lol.). The personification of chivalry and that\u2019s about it. I have nothing much to say about his character other than that. He\u2019s not a bad character but I didn\u2019t give a shit about him that much. He\u2019s just a bit perfect for my taste. I sometimes imagine him walking and the words noble, gentleman, handsome, and perfect will simultaneously pop on top of his head. You know, like that one in Seitokai Yakuindomo (Fun show. Go watch it.). lol. I\u2019m getting a little sexist but that\u2019s fine, right? I\u2019m a man after all so I think it\u2019s natural that I care about Juliet more than him. In all seriousness though, I feel like he\u2019s a male nadeshiko, perfect, just too perfect for my taste.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\n\tRomeo x Juliet was animated by Gonzo back in 2007. But if you\u2019re familiar with Gonzo, you know that they are a bit hit and miss. Though they can make amazing stuffs like Full Metal Panic, they can also do things like Gantz. It\u2019s as if they flip a coin and be like: \u201cIf its head then let\u2019s put all our effort in it, but if its tails then let\u2019s just fuck it\u201d. Well, going back on topic. In Romeo x Juliet\u2019s case, I think it\u2019s safe to say that the coin landed on its head. The animation is nothing too fancy but definitely still worthy of praise. I don\u2019t remember seeing any CG which is like Gonzo\u2019s trademark. I just might not have noticed it but I\u2019m pretty sure they didn\u2019t wave their 3D cocks in this series. Not much bombastic scene other than the few battle scenes and the \u201cthing\u201d in the end so the animation was a little stale but I think it\u2019s not enough to deter future viewers. Overall, the animation is pretty polished for a Gonzo show.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\n\tIf I can marry a voice actress, it would probably be Brina Palencia. She\u2019s got the looks, the voice, and the wits (Go check out her con-session videos with J. Michael Tatum on Youtube, it\u2019s really cute). So when I heard her dub for Juliet, I was seriously fangasming. Just like how Crispin Freeman is the embodiment of Alucard, Brina is the only one meant to play as Juliet. She nailed both her damsel in distress persona as well as her Odin alter ego. In regard to Chris Burnett who played Romeo, it\u2019s a real good dub; however, I think there are other ones who are much more suited for the job. I can\u2019t really think of a name, but I just felt that his dub was not as powerful as Brina\u2019s. And because I have only seen the dub, I don\u2019t really have anything to say about the sub. I\u2019ve never seen the Japo dub line up as well, so I can\u2019t predict if it\u2019s a good dub on their part. So, if you plan on watching it for the first time, it\u2019s only obvious that I suggest that you watch it dubbed. It\u2019s a Funimation dub so it\u2019s really good.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe soundtrack is really good too, specially the different variations of the original \u201cYou Raise Me Up\u201d by Josh Groban. Though repetitive, I wouldn\u2019t say I was unhappy about it because it was always used at the right moment. One perfect time when it was used was at episode 7. Oh my god, I swear to God (even if I\u2019m an atheist), my testosterone level have never been so low my entire life. I was about to squeal but I was watching it with my friends so I had to hold back a little. Anyway, yeah, at that time when a certain event happened at episode 7, the way they used You Raise Me Up was just godly. To this day, every time I watch it, I still get goosebumps. All I can say is, well done. There\u2019s also this instrumental version of the song (I really suck at identifying sounds. It might be a guitar or a piano or neither) and when I hear that, I naturally sing along with it.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\\n\r\n\tIf there\u2019s one \u201cflaw\u201d in this series, I would say it was its ending. Though technically not a flaw, I feel like as a human being, you have already been spoiled even before you  watch this show (If you don\u2019t know how Romeo and Juliet ends then you, my friend, have been living under a rock your whole life. And since I\u2019m a bit generous today, here\u2019s a gift: Romeo and Juliet both die in the end. You\u2019re welcome). Though the means differ in both mediums, the tragedy is still present and may deter some people because they know what will happen. No offense to those who have that mindset, but I personally thinks that\u2019s a stupid reason for not even touching the show. Romeo and Juliet is a true masterpiece in any medium and we should all watch it at least once in our lifetime. Do not be deterred by the spoiler, even if they both die, their trials and hardships are what make the story incredible. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the destination, it\u2019s about the journey\u201d.\\n\\n\r\n\tWith all that said, after some random computations, I\u2019d gladly give Romeo x Juliet an overall score of 9.06 out of 10. As a true masterpiece made by the one and only William Shakespeare, no human being have the acceptable excuse to not watch it. It is a beautiful story of love and revenge that I\u2019m sure 95% of viewers will really like. The other 5% probably have poor taste or just men with really high testosterone level. If you have not seen it yet, you have my full pledged recommendation in doing so. If my reviews have somehow helped you in the past then this one will surely end up to your liking as well.\\n\\n\r\nAlternate Anime Recommendation:\\n\\n\r\n\tFor alternate anime recommendation, why don\u2019t you try Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo? Both series centers around love and revenge that somewhat led to a tragic end. Though do not be deterred as both series have an outstanding journey in between them. And funny enough, both series was made by Gonzo back in the day and both of them are adaptations from really popular stories; Romeo and Juliet for Romeo x Juliet and The Count of Monte Cristo for Gankutsuou.\\n\\n\r\n\tIf you don\u2019t like classic literature that much then we have\u2026 hmmm\u2026 *checks list* Ah! Got one! Nisekoi! I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cWHAT A SHITTY RECOMMENDATION FOR ROME X JULIET!\u201d I know! I should probably punch myself. Though in defense, let me give some obvious comparisons. Both series have family feuds, romance (hahahaha!), and tragedy (because Nisekoi is a harem! Hahahahaha!). Though be warned that even if both series are somewhat comparable, they could never be much more different. I just couldn\u2019t find another anime in my list that had the same premise so, yeah, fuck me! Hahaha!\\n\\n\r\n\tAnd that\u2019s it for me! Thanks for reading! Bye!\\n",

            "content": "ROMEO x JULIET. The name itself calls only one thing to mind: Shakespeare's most famous tragedy, the tale of the star-crossed lovers, Romeo & Juliet. However, if you want to see an anime adaptation, don't bother with this. After the first four minutes, you will see this has very little resemblance to Shakespeare  (in fact, one of the characters in the anime is named Willy Shakespeare). \r\nStory -- 6\r\nI hate hate hate how fangirls and fanboys are going crazy over this. This anime was heavily promoted at anime cons, online ads, previews, etc. However, when its name is literally ROMEO X JULIET, you expect...youknow...some resemblance to the play, at all? Within the first few minutes, they basically show you the only thing in common is that the characters are named after the ones in the play, and that, yes, it is about two noble children that fall in love and are separated. But here's the issue: it's not separation by the families -- no -- its separation due to the fact that the boy's father gruesomely murdered every other member of the girl's family. Talk about a lot to overcome.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is meh at best. It is creative, to say the least. It's set in an island floating in the sky, in a place called Neo-Verona (go figure) where it's basically  Italy in the 1600s, except with pegasi. However, this anime is SET UP to be a tragedy -- the problem being that, by the end of the anime, you actually are way too attached to the characters to let them die. In fact, because it doesn't follow Romeo & Juliet by Shakespeare at all, you have NO idea IF they die or not. And you become so attached to the main characters that you're praying that it basically bastardizes the original work of Shakespeare and allows them to live. (Spoiler: Don't worry, they still die.)\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to this, the story skips around a bit and adds in random crap that isn't exactly necessary. Although it makes for more time to show off the awesome amazingness that is the soundtrack and art, the story itself takes a hit to allow that to happen.\\n\\n\r\nArt -- 9\\n\\n\r\nSHINYYYYYYYYYY.\\n\\n\r\nThat basically sums up the art. It's high quality. Really, really high quality. Some of the highest quality anime art available with the current technology, I'd go as far as to say. It beats the crap out of any of the mainstream shojo or shonen anime art quality. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound -- 10\\n\\n\r\nWarning: Rampant fanboyism ahead\\n\\n\r\nOh my god. The one thing -- one thing -- that makes this anime remember-able, other than being very, very shiny, is two (well, rather, one) songs that form the soundtrack. I don't even remember the rest of the soundtrack -- but the cover of Secret Garden's \"You Raise Me Up\" by Lena Park is jawdropping. She even had it transposed for a Japanese song, entitled Inori You Raise Me Up, which also happens to be the opening theme for the series. It does not follow the lyrics of You Raise Me Up at all, but flows very nicely and serenely -- if you had not known it were based off of the tune of You Raise Me Up, you would still love it. Between the sappy romance and the utter gore of Romeo X Juliet, hearing about star-crossed lovers and how one shall always support another in such an inspiring song in both English and Japanese says something. This has to be one of the best, if not the best, soundtracks of any anime. Ever.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -- 6\\n\\n\r\nFair would be, well, fair to describe what the characters are. They are loosely based off their namesakes in Shakespeare's play. There is only one very well done performance in the anime. The performance of Juliet, when she decides to be a rebel and crusade as the Red Zorro...er, rather, the Red Whirlwind* shows a compassionate level of caring not found in most characters, giving Juliet both a strength and a weakness to her character. The other characters are basically static throughout, but show enough emotion to give this a \"fair\" review. They act believable, which is enough for me.\\n\\n\r\n*No. Really. She is basically Zorro, but with a red hat. Don't believe me? Google it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -- 6\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment during \"You Raise Me Up\"  -- 9\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise -- 5.8\\n\\n\r\nEvens out to a 6. Ish. Honestly, the anime is \"cute\" to say the least, and is entertaining. The enjoyment value again varies on your taste; if you're looking for a refined anime, keep looking. Try Cowboy Bebop. But if you're looking for a very well made, artistically at least, anime with an amazing soundtrack, you will enjoy the anime very much. The characters are meh, as is the plot, but for me, the art and soundtrack make it a worthwhile investment to see.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\\n\r\nThe 7 represents the culmination of an average or below average anime which has an amazing budget, aka, making it very very shiny with an awesome soundtrack. It would normally get a 5 or 6 -- not rememberable -- but due to its high budget, hype, well made art, and beautiful soundtrack, it is bumped up to a 7. If you really just want to experience the anime in its fullest, however, just watch episode seven. It has all the music and art in one package.",

            "content": "Romeo X Juliet\r\nSynopsis:\r\nThe story is an excessively exaggerated remake of the popular Shakespeare play Romeo and Juliet filled with happiness, strife, an ambitious evil emperor, and the drive for love. The plot itself is about two lovers who were never meant to be together because of their opposing families, but love cannot keep them apart. They will find a way to live together even if it means defying their family name.\r\nBesides the beautiful story line, I did have a few pet peeves with the overall style of the anime. Yes, the action can be intense at times with sword-to-sword battle, but being allowed to jump/fallfrom the top of building and still land perfectly is beyond realism. It's great that we don't have to watch the main characters sit in a hospital for numerous episodes, but seriously not even bearing a scratch or bruise.. it's too much for me to bear. It hurts me to see those things. \\n\\n\r\nThere are other story elements that I'll try not to judge too harshly such as hosting a wedding in the middle of wartime immediately after the commander stating that the soldiers are prepared to go to war. Things like this are what is allowed in animation, and I'll leave it to you if you think that's okay, but it lacks a realistic scenario.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really hard to judge this anime harshly while listening to the opening song on repeat. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now with the ratings:\\n\r\nStory - 6 - Numerous elements of the story line were flipped from the original Shakespeare story, as if the director was given a list of names to include in the play with a very vague memory of what was suppose to happen.\\n\r\nGraphics - 8 - Pretty modern graphics here. Nothing too exciting. Very bright colours. Most everything was in high quality, but few things were finely detailed.\\n\r\nSound - 7 - Touching music at certain points, but I never felt totally enthralled at any moment due to the killer situational musical atmosphere.\\n\r\nCharacter personas - 7 - The mad king was played very well and the old english dialect kept me smiling.  Otherwise, Romeo and Juliet just weren't exciting.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6 - When I think about it, it all boils down to the entire play lacking humour, detailed action scenes, and witty commentary, which are all very compelling human characteristics to be missing.\\n\r\nRecommended - I kind of got the 'meh' feel from this new remake. It had it's moments, but they were few and far between. In a hard answer, I would have to say, \"No, I would recommend a different anime with more depth.\"",

            "content": "I discovered this anime by listening to the theme song on an anime playlist I have saved on Youtube. The song is called \"Inori\" - which is the Japanese version of \"You Raise Me Up\", one of my favorite songs. This wasn't the first time I fell in love with a song from an anime that lead me into watching it\u00a0(\"Angel Beats!\",\u00a0\"The World is Still Beautiful\",\u00a0\"Uta no Prince Sama\"). I dove into the anime and thought \"what could go wrong?\"\r\nA lot of things apparently.\u00a0\r\nFirst off, I had a really hard time keeping up with this anime because there were some times where it bored mehalf to death or a character did something pretty stupid. The only character I really enjoyed was Francisco who was one of Juliet's bodyguards. Another thing, Francisco and Curio were far better looking than Romeo, I'm surprised Juliet didn't fall in love with one of them before she met her forbidden lover.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nIf anyone knows the original \"Romeo and Juliet\", you know that the two lovers are together at almost all times after they meet. In this spinoff, there were only about five episodes out of the twenty-four where Romeo and Juliet were actually together. That really annoyed because EVERYONE knows Romeo and Juliet as a ROMANCE TRADEGY, but it is very hard for the show to be romantic in any way if the two lovers are always separated.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, the two characters who were supposed to be the comical relief characters weren't funny at all, just plain annoying.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was the worst of all. I know the creators wanted the anime to be a little different from the play, but I just thought the idea of what they came up with was pretty lame. We all know that in the end, Romeo and Juliet commit suicide, but the ending when they DID die was so rushed that I had no idea what was happening. The creators must have put zero thought into the ending given that everyone knows that both Romeo and Juliet die in the end.\u00a0\\n",

Who wants to read a play about two young teens who kill themselves because they think the other is dead (practically right after they met)? It sounds silly. But Romeo X Juliet takes the brilliant parts of Shakespeare's play and turns them into a truly fantastic anime. \r\nStory: 10\r\nFor a plot that was (loosely) based off of a previously written work, this was done remarkably well. Each episode makes you eager for the next. \r\nArt:10\\n\r\nNot your conventional art for an anime, but once you get past the first few episodes, you get used to it. Some of the backgrounds are especially beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\r\nThe music is very fitting to the atmosphere of the anime and adds much to it. The OP version of \"You Raise Me Up\" made me fall in love with the song. I also liked the ending songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe character development in this anime is phenomenal. Almost all of the major characters go through some sort of change, and I'm not just talking Romeo and Juliet. Even the more annoying characters get more likable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime. It always keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you just have to see what happens next. The end of each episode is just too tempting. If you like a good romance (and a tearjerker) I would highly recommend watching Romeo X Juliet.",

Even if you haven't seen the play, or worked on it as I have, you'll know the basic outline of the play. Apparently those who created this didn't. Had this been an original anime I may have enjoyed it- perhaps watched the rest of the series, but simply because they killed a classic I can't bring myself to finish it.

            "content": "When I went into this one, I really had no idea what to expect and what to receive. It's Shakespeare... as anime.\r\nThis would either be the best thing ever, or the most painful.\r\nStory - to begin with, this isn't really Romeo and Juliet. The anime adds a lot of completely original elements, like (Neo-)Verona being a floating city in the sky, the existence of Dragonsteeds (which should be self-explanatory), people in oppression, a \"La R\u00e9sistance\"-esque group of vigilantes and most importantly changes the morality from grey-and-grey to black-and-white. And that's this anime's biggest flaw. Capulet and their allies are pure and good and Montague arepure evil and rotten to the core, with the exception of Romeo who is almost ridiculously kind.\\n\r\nThere are also the problem that every major character seems obligated to, at one point or another through the story, act like a complete and utter moron! It's impossible to count how many things could have been avoided if the characters just stopped to think once in a while. Sure, it's a way to get them from point A to point B, but there were much better and smarter ways of doing so.\\n\\n\r\nArt - the art and animation are mostly good, especially in the first half of the show before getting sloppier for a while, most likely saving itself for the finale. Character designs are nice, body proportions in particular, and the backgrounds and colors are very nice to look at. CGI do appear and while it isn't glaringly obvious it does look a little odd mixed with the traditional art. Drawbacks are thing's \"side-mouths\", which happen quite often, and walking animation, which can look a little stiff from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nSound - simply brilliant. There are two ending themes, the first a rock-song and the other a ballad, both very good. The opening theme, a cover of \"You Raise me Up\" by Lena Park, is even better and is actually sung once in English in ep. 7.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - all major characters and even a few minor from the original play makes appearance and are aided by several original one's. The complexity varies but most of them are sadly simplified from their theatre-counterpart. Romeo and Juliet's \"feminine boy, masculine girl\" dynamic are exaggerated into making him shy and sweet and her a hot-blooded Action Girl. Tybalt is angry and brooding, Benvolio is nothing but Romeo's voice of reason and the most similar to his original characterization. And then there's Mercutio.\\n\r\nOh god. Mercutio.\\n\r\nFrom being probably the most beloved - a charming, boisterous jokester - he's made into a smug snob with more connection to Montague than to Romeo. I found myself shutting my ears off whenever he appeared on screen.\\n\r\nHowever the original characters, Conrad, Curio, Francisco, Cordelia (the \"nurse\") among others, I actually found myself enjoying.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, while there are some interesting aspects brought forth, in the end this anime fails as an adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. As just another animated show, however? It's pretty damn good.\\n\r\nDespite stupid decisions on the characters part, despite botching of beloved characters and despite the change from \"is anyone actually in the right?\" to a \"simple\" tale of good-vs-evil I still enjoyed myself thoroughly while watching. Every episode brought at least one laugh and the finale even some misty eyes.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a hard-core Shakespeare fan, you probably shouldn't watch this unless you're out to anger yourself. If, on the other hand, you're a bit more relaxed, don't care for the original to begin with or just want a new show to follow this is one definitely worth contemplating.",

Romeo and Juliet was originally about two teenagers of two opposing houses who accidentally fell in lust (I don't believe in the lie of love at first sight) with each other. This story spans all of two weeks and shows just how hormonal we teenagers really are!\r\nThe anime was barely different.\r\nNow sure, I'll be the first to admit that Romeo and Juliet was not my favorite Shakespeare play which makes me mildly bias, but I watched this because of the amazing reviews from friends. I was thoroughly disappointed. The storywas changed and became an overused tissue of a plot. Boy meets girl (that he can't have) boy and girl fall in love, boy and girl make promise of staying together forever, boy, girl, or both, dies. (SPOILER:::::::: Well technically she turns into a tree and he's turned into a human shish kebab, which is ridiculous in itself.)\\n\\n\r\nAnyhow- this art was fabulous but was not enough to change my mind. As for sound- I see the pun within the main song \"Wind Beneath My Wings\", but they play it three or four plus times every friggin' episode, making me detest the song!! And I love that song...The characters- ooo, the characters. I actually really liked that they pulled names from Willy's other plays AND even had him as a character. He, Curio and the doctor (bless his soul)  were probably the only reasons I kept watching.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if you're looking for an anime with a predictable plot, silly ending and broken record music (With great art and interesting side characters), then by all means, watch Romeo x Juliet.",

            "content": "This is my first review so please bear with me but I felt like there were some things about this anime that I had to discuss even though I thoroughly enjoyed it.\r\nStory - 6\r\nI thought the story was a sweet, fresh take on Romeo and Juliet, adding some themes of magic and more of fairytale-like feel. The fact that it was hardly an adaptation at all of Romeo and Juliet is what really ruined the story. There were a lot of differences in Romeo x Juliet than the original with the setting being in Neo-Verona;  a floating island in the sky, creatures called dragonhorseswhich is literally a pegasus with a dragon tail, Juliet and a few loyal members being the last of the Capulets and not to mention a few other smaller changes. I was deeply disappointed in the balcony scene in the anime as it is one of the most famous scenes of the story of Romeo and Juliet and they screwed up the other most famous scene; the deaths of Romeo and Juliet too. I felt like they couldn't adapt any of the true parts of Shakespeare's work into the anime at all turning this into a story of it's own. I enjoyed the first 22 episodes but the last 2 episodes I felt went away from the story a bit and became too magical for my liking, they were unnecessary to the anime as a whole making me put it down a point. I sort of wish they stuck to the original idea of Romeo and Juliet's demise than the ending they did which felt like too much.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nThe art was nice, it was pretty and simple and I liked the continuous use of flowers. I did like the look of the ruins of buildings covered in flowers, the church being my favorite. The dragonhorses were beautiful also. The settings were nice and pretty but the character designs could have been better.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8 (Japanese subbed)\\n\r\nThe music was lovely, it matched the tone of Romeo x Juliet very well. The opening song (\"You Raise Me Up\" in japanese) was enjoyable and I felt it was a perfect start of each episode. The voice actors were great but I felt like Juliet could have had a better voice actor, after all she has been through in the anime I think I would have liked her to have a stronger, more determined voice but that was alright. I don't have anything to say about the english dub voice actors because I generally find them to sound cheesy so i didn't bother with that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6\\n\r\nIn the beginning I did take a liking to Juliet but her character started to annoy me as I felt like she became two different people; the strong, righteous character we are first introduced to and admire and then the pathetic Juliet whom continuously cries due to love. I know that is the true essence of the story; the heartbreaks and pain of loving someone whom you can not be with but it annoyed me in how weak she was when concerning Romeo. She also was clumsy at times doing stupid mistakes, when we had seen her doing magnificent acrobatic work and fighting as the 'Red Whirlwind' so that was a bit annoying. Romeo was alright, I didn't like him that much because he was so sensitive all the time and a little boring, he was a very typical princely love interest so I found him rather dull. I really didn't like how selfish Romeo and Juliet became in the last couple of episodes especially after being portrayed as selfless throughout most of the series, It annoyed me. I did get tired of Romeo and Juliet always uttering each other's names in a pathetic, whiny voice but maybe that's because I wasn't too enthusiastic with their love. The other characters were well done and some were developed nicely. We got to see the background of a few of them which was done well (except maybe Montague's background which wasn't really elaborated and was a bit far fetched), I wish we got to learn more about how Francisco and Curio came into service with the Capulets though. I also liked how Mercutio became in the end showing that there was more to him than I had thought and it made me pity him rather than hate. Putting William Shakespeare as a character was risky but they did a good job with him so I was pleased. The characters were realistic, as the anime went on I got a true feel of each character in the anime giving them their own individual identity. The only reason why I put a low score for the character's was due to the main two character's being quite frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\r\nAlthough I got tired of the romance between Romeo and Juliet, I did enjoy the anime a lot. There was some humour that made me laugh a couple of times and there was a good amount of tragedy   but also light heartedness. The fact that Romeo and Juliet were in love when they had hardly said anything to each other except each other's names and how hard it is to be together made me enjoy it less than I would have and  I felt like I was forcing myself to watch the scenes with the two of them together. I was hoping to hear Juliet yell \"O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo\" at some point but maybe that was hoping for too much considering how little they followed the actual story. By the end of the anime I felt happy and sweet although disappointed a little with the last two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\r\nIf it followed the original Romeo and Juliet at all I feel like this could've been much better although saying this I did like how original it was and the new direction it went in (which mostly away from anything of the original). Overall I give Romeo x Juliet a 7 which would have been higher if they had cut the last two episodes and had more development of the revolution ending it a more traditional sense of Romeo and Juliet, and Juliet and Romeo had more depth to their relationship. If you're looking for an anime that stays true to Shakespeare's work, I would definitely not recommend this but if you don't mind at how loose this adaptation of Romeo and Juliet is then I say you may as well give it a try!",

            "content": "Romeo and Juliet the famous story of William Shakespeare about love, sex, tragedy and death received a lot of adaptations in the media through TV series and a live action film directed by Moulin Rouge director Baz Lutherman. Romeo X Juliet was heavily divided by many Shakespearian fans with other fans saying that it's a solid adaptation to it's source material and the other fans saying that it's bombastic and nonsensical to it's original story. To be honest, I really liked this series and sure there are some crucial changes to the original Shakespeare story, but somehow it manages to stay true to the spiritof the original story without being nonsensical.\\n\\n\r\nIn the original story of Romeo and Juliet, it's was basically about two star crossed lovers in which their deaths unite their families, who are both rivals, but in the anime series of Romeo X Juliet is the exception of the plot: The members of House Capulet, including Juliet's parents, are murdered by Prince Leontes Montague and cut to years later in Neo Verona, Juliet is now sixteen and dresses herself as a boy with the name Odin and she is also known as \"The Red Whirlwind\" as she fights off Montagues forces to protect the innocent people that suffer through Leontes rule. During the annual Rose Ball, both Romeo and Juliet meet in the fountain and they fall in love very quick. As both Romeo and Juliet try to be together, Capulet royalists like Francisco and Curio are planning a rebellion against Leontes and in the couse of the series, Romeo and Juliet's love get stronger and a secret in Neo Verona is waiting to be revealed. \\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about the good things about Romeo X Juliet, cause, to be honest, there are tons of good things about the series. The animation by Gonzo is top-notch, with beautiful art and creative setting that stays close to the setting of the original story, but with fantasy elements mixed in (like the flying horses and the floating city of Neo Verona). The chemistry with Romeo and Juliet is great and while it does take a few moments for them to actually fall in love, it works and they share a pretty good chemistry like they fly on the horse together, they talk about their past lives, fight off a bunch of thugs together, they share food and even Romeo and Juliet make an oath on an abandoned sanctuary and that part did made me cry. The main villain Leontes Montegue is frightening, because deep down, the character has so much hatred and despair in his heart that you know why noblemen fear him in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nJuliet as a stronger and independent character is a welcome change, allowing the character to be more heroic and confident than the original story.. Side characters like Francisco, William De Franese, Curio, Cordelia, Conrad, and Antonio are fun to watch and they provide some decent moments that provide a nice change of tone. The music by Final Fantasy 12 composer Hitoshi Sakimoto is gorgeous. This is one of the most underrated soundtracks ever made and it a damn shame cause it really brings a sense of love, passion and tragedy that fits perfectly well to the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe English dub in Romeo X Juliet by Funimation is perfect. It's better than the Japanese dub and it delivers top-notch Shakespearian dialogue and referencing some quotes in other Shakespeare plays like Hamlet and The Tempest. The cast did a great job with their performances with each giving character roles. Brina Palencia was perfect for the role as Juliet, capturing both the weak feminine and the strong willed side of the character, while Chris Burnett performance as Romeo is less impressive in the first half of the series but his performance improves later on in the second half of the series when things go chaotic.  Sean Hannigan's performance as the main villain Leontes is terrifying and every-time he speaks, it gives me chills through my spine.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the major flaws of Romeo X Juliet is that there's no rivalry between House Capulet and the Montague Nobles, cause they basically killed everyone from House Capulet and it's a shame too, since the family rivalry played a major role in the original Romeo and Juliet story and It also lead them to accept forgiveness and being united again cause of the tragic death of Romeo and Juliet. The side character villains are mediocre and there basically there to be evil bastards and side characters like Elizabeth and Emilia are completely forgettable and unneeded in the story. As for the ending of the series, I like it and felt like a nice closure to the series. However, if you're a fan of the original play, be aware that the ending of THIS adaptation is completely changed from the original and if you don't like that change, then you might be pissed at it.\\n\\n\r\nRomeo X Juliet is a great series that people can easily get into. Those who can accept the changes of the original play will find a series that adds new elements to make the story feel new again. If you're a fan of the original story then by all means, watch this series. It's a solid adaptation to the play and it's 10x better than the live action film Romeo + Juliet that came out in the 90's.",

            "content": "I went into this anime really wanting to like it. And I did - fo about half the show. \r\nThe story is focusing on the classic romance between Romeo and Juliet, and mixes in fantasy elements. \r\nJuliet starts out as a vigilante-type character who opposes the oppressive rulers, the Montague family, and is in the beinning really cool and driven, who eventually finds out she is the last Capulet - the former rulers of the nation. \r\nRomeo is the heir of the Montague family and is a compassionate, kind young man who wants to grow up to do the best for the people. \r\nNow, thissets up a very cool scenario about freedom-fighting and forbidden love, and it really works - in the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nWhen the characters inevitably fall for each other it feels like they just don't care about the fight for the people anymore and the plot feels a lot flatter after about the halfway mark... \\n\r\nAnd I won't spoil anything, but what the heck was up with that ending? It just felt very rushed and forced. \\n\\n\r\nI would reccomend this anime if you're just looking for a romantic anime, and not much else. \\n\r\nBut if you came to this anime because you heard it was a cool romantic story about classisism, family feuds, freedom fighting and an interesting, unique twist on a classic story you should maybe not waste your time on this.",

            "content": "By the title of this anime, Rome x Juliet, you already know that this is a story about two people that fall in love, but it's different. There's soo much more and a whole new thought in this storyline. There's a reason behind everything!\r\nThe story was well written. It is a bit cheesy compared to Shakespears version. But I liked how there's more action and some fighting scenes. Also the fact that Romeo and Juliet are actually spending time together. It gives them an even more reason to want to be with each other. There's Romance, Tragedy, Drama, and Fantasy.\r\nThe opening theme( You Raise MeUp- by Lena Park) was beautifully sung and really set the mood. I really enjoy this song :] The ending theme (Cyclone- by 12012) wasn't that bad either.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the characters might have been unnecessary, but in the end they played their part just fine. No one in this story stuck out more then the main characters, Romeo and Juliet. They did, however, help us understand the true warm-hearted  personalities of these two lovers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed it. The entire story was well thought out, Love at First Sight, the Rose and Iris, Escalus, and the fact that it took place on a floating island. Like I said earlier, the story is somewhat like the original play. The falling in love and tragic fate, but the episodes aren't predictable. Each one has a shocking twist to it which is awesome because in the end it all ties together. Basically everything has a meaning to it. Definitely worth watching.",

            "content": "Romeo x Juliet, is it Romeo and Juliet? no.\r\nThis anime is based very loosely on William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet so, if you happen to be familiar with the English classic (most of us are) prepare to be surprised.\r\nStory:\r\nIf you've seen the 2004 film Troy (starring Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Diane Kruger, Sean Bean and Orlando Bloom) it may be easier for you to understand the premise of the story - how an inspiration becomes a legend. \r\nRomeo x Juliet follows two young nobles Romeo, the son of the despotic Montague Ruler and Juliet, the only surviving daughter of the slaughtered Capulet family, come togrips with their identity, love and society around them and what the struggles that they take when trying to instigate change.\\n\r\nWhile the setting is nice, those of you who are turned off by high fantasy be warned. Like the sword of akashe in Code Geass, there were some things that i just didn't get the first time through and if this is not your thing, know that it is present. I would've given the story an 8 if it weren't for this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nCharacters are what i feel really bring a story to life in anime and personally, the characters in romeo x Juliet really took a while to grow on me. \\n\r\nA key element in the story of this anime is the growth of romeo and juliet from young naive youths into capable and responsible adults. While their development eventually fleshes out their characters, this did make the first few episodes really hard to press through for me.\\n\r\nThe side characters also fulfilled their roles capably, although i did wish for more fleshed out backstories, so don't expect Angel beats. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art in Romeo x Juliet is very... clean. If you like anime in general, you should have nothing to complain about Romeo x Juliet. One thing that i did notice was that, the artwork did not have any of the hyper-sexualisation present in a lot of anime that I've seen lately. None of the characters are particularly 'hot' in my opinion, but all of them have a nice simple artwork that doesn't scream big-boobs or fan service but allows down-to-earth characters and human personalities to shine through.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe voice actors all do a fairly good job and sound believable although the hyper 'Willy' William Shakespeare may be slightly annoying at times. \\n\r\nAppropriate music highlights some of the more epic or moving moments in the show, building a nice environment that really had me immersed in some of the more touching moments of the show.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict:\\n\r\nMy friend recommended this show to me and i was skeptical at first,  but give the show a go and you might be surprised.",

            "content": "Romeo X Juliet- Not to be confused with Romeo and Juliet, of course. It was a good anime... in its own way. However, if you are looking for the perfect anime adaptation, you will be sorely disappointed. The only striking similarity between the two is the names. Having said that, I did enjoy this anime. It was a touching love story. Here come the numbers-\r\nStory-6 (Fair)\r\n     Good, quite fast-paced in the beginning. Exciting, even. But then came the middle... it became so boring that I quit watching for a while, and valiantly returned some time later, to find that at theend the pace picked up again. But it some points it seemed very random. Not all ends were tied up. So it was decent, but nothing great.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 6 (Fair)\\n\r\n     I personally liked the art. However, I am not an artist. My sister, who is, says that the art was painful to her.I thought that the animation style was inconsistent. But they had great backgrounds, like in the fields of flowers. So I gave it a 6.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 8 (Very Good)\\n\r\n     The opener was really great. I loved it. The rest of the music is... forgettable. But I loved the opener so much that I found it to be quite redeeming in the score for music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-5 (Mediocre)\\n\r\n     Slightly cliche. The tragic heroine, the brave hero, the evil tyrant, etc., etc. But there were some good side characters whom I really liked. Side characters make a series, and I personally liked the side characters more than the main ones. The main characters were very weak.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-7 (Good)\\n\r\n     Yeah, I enjoyed it. It was my first romance anime. It was nice. Nothing great, though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-7 (Good)\\n\r\n     It was pretty good, actually. The end was confusing- they didn't tie up many of the ends. I was slightly disappointed with how loosely interpreted the storyline was from Shakespeare's version. But I did like it.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in short, it was a decent anime. I liked it well enough. It was worth watching, but I wouldn't watch it again or buy it. A nice love story.",

The story evolves wonderfully. Love at first sight. Then a struggle to pursue that love no matter what. But the protagonists love their countryas well as its people just as much is what really caught my attention to watch this anime. It sort of makes them the heroes of their masses. Continuity of the story is good. Both Romeo and Juliet struggle to release the people of Neo verona from the clutches of the Dark King Montague who only desires power to rule all things in his grasp and beyond. Conflicts of strong emotions of love, compassion, anger, sadness are beautifully shown throughout the series. The way Neo Verona is uphead as a floating mass of land and its story is intriguing. I personally would have loved if the anime detailed some bits about how that floating continent came into being and the tree of life associated with it. Would have added a whole chunk of fantasy to the already plum plot of the series. The tragedy which follows in the end of the story just highlights the need for existence of both the protagonists and their struggles.\\n\\n\r\nArt [10/10]: The art of the series is definitely not mind-blowing but is very good nonetheless. Both the protagonists are nicely drawn. And their emotions rightly conveyed through the illustrations and animation together. Ruins inside the Neo Verona city or its outskirts have been aptly drawn, like the ruins of a church like structure in one of the episodes, or the where Romeo and Juliet meet on her birthday, etc. The castle exterior and interior are grand. Flowerbeds in the garden and forest landscaping is beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound [10/10]: Hitoshi Sakamoto has done an excellent job on giving amazingly melodious Piano and Violin pieces. Deai, Kakki, Kimi no Iru Sekai are my favorites. The OP Inori- You raise me up is beautiful and the rocking ED cyclone. Voice actors of all characters have done a great job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters [10/10]: The tender hearts of both Romeo and Juliet have been brought out beautifully through their characters. I think the way the characters have been drawn also add to this. King Montague's past which has led him to become such a tyrant is very believable. His last words really add a lot in understanding his complex character in the end. Characters of all the colleagues of both protagonists are well built.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [10/10]: It was a complete package really. It has bit of all things that attract a viewer to any anime romance, drama, action, adventure, fantasy. Never was a boring moment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [10/10]: Full marks for a very entertaining show.",

            "content": "Japan, in its history of filmmaking, has adapted Shakespeare's works. There are those which are pretty good (Throne of Blood) and there are those which are glorious masterpieces (Ran). This anime version of Romeo & Juliet falls kind of somewhere between. The story centres around the forbidden love people are familiar with.\r\nBUT WAIT. What's this, everyone is now on floating island? There are horses that can fly?\r\nOk, fine. it sounds like the worst idea imaginable, I know, but there are forces at work here which make this series pretty good on the whole. The central characters (not just our titular pair) are well written anddeveloped, the animation stands out quite well, given Gonzo's reputation for sometimes letting a few mistakes slip into previous works.\\n\\n\r\nThe key thing above all things, however, is the english dub, which does something the original japanese does not. It adapts the script into Shakesperean dialogue, which just makes everything just seem right. But, you say, the voice acting is probably inferior? Nothing could be further from the truth. To be honest with anyone reading this, Romeo & Juliet in my view is a strong contender for having the best dub (alongside Black Lagoon, Kill la Kill, Toradora!, Excel Saga, Baccano! and Steins:Gate) ever recorded.",

Yes, this is Romeo and Juliet but the anime has this complete entertaining twist making maybe the storyline even better than the original. Basically, Montague has taken over \"Neo Verona\" slaying House Capulet except its sole and only survivor Juliet who must disguise herself as a boy in order to survive. In this harsh and suffering society Juliet meets Romeo and thus the story unfolds.\r\nThis anime has all ofyour favorites like Mercutio, Benvolio, and even the play writer himself William Shakespeare and a cast of such depth making one question, is this really the &quot;where are thou?&quot; Romeo and Juliet??? I am a person who greatly judges any anime/manga by its storyline and this has to be my favorite anime I have seen this year (well, next to Paprika). I swear Romeo X Juliet will completely surprise you at its art, storyline and music which makes this series positively solid through and through.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, for you people who are not into the romantic stuff cause it is Romeo and Juliet like myself, trust me there is plenty of action fighting to keep you entertained from your very own heroine (that's right Juliet's the fighter in this one) and the rest of the cast. For the haters (just kidding), there's also romantic stuff for you too. \\n\r\nThis has to be the hidden jewel for 2007 because of what it is, a hated 9th grade final research and journal project Shakespearean play but as you can see from the previous post, the grading score needs to be boosted to at least 20 in order to barely justify the greatness of this masterpiece.",

            "content": "Romeo X Juliet, though the story borrows mostly from the Shakespeare\u2019s story it is presented in a remarkably different way. The story has been changed a little in order to remove overly used clich\u00e9 moments by making it a somewhat opaque. Due to the fact that this is an anime adaptation, it has been moulded to fit it, by offering mythical beast such as flying horse called Dragon Steeds.\r\nStory: (9/10)\r\nThe story revolves around our two main characters Romeo and Juliet who are bounded by love but separated by fate. I am impressed on how the story is altered not entirely but in some parts togive it a fresh tone. Each episode ended with a cliffhanger, and each episode felt fairly good. Although it doesn't carry the same tragic feelings on all parts, you can still feel the pain of separation and tenderness.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThough I haven\u2019t really read the original play so I can\u2019t compare, the characters were very well built, each having their own personality. The complexity of each character was splendid. Many of the supporting characters have names from other Shakespeare plays too!\\n\\n\r\nSound: (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the show really shines. The background music blended perfectly with the scenes, the emotions in them really stood out. As for the ending and opening sequences, I never skipped them; they were just too touching and poignant in some ways. One more thing, the dub, this is first show I would recommend watching dubbed, the English lines are much more related to the old English. The fluid talks and use of old English in some scenes really merged well. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation(7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe only downside of the show, tough personally it wasn't much of a bother but still the art feels a little bland. But still the brushed out colours matches the setting perfectly. The animation is not so smooth in some part and I felt drop in quality after 15 episodes, but still it didn't took away from the show.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nI am not a fan of Shakespeare\u2019s work but this adaption really amazed me, the story, characters, sound all blended beautifully to provide and exceptional and lasting impression for me. Though the story deviates from the original and the introduction of fantasy elements might turn away some but if you are not a die-hard fan of Shakespeare and don\u2019t get bothered by change, please watch the show. It is just too good to be ignored.\\n",

            "content": "\"Till death do us part.\"\r\nRomeo x Juliet, based off of the infamous play by William Shakesphere, tells the heartrending tale of two young nobles, in love, whose country is plagued by war, hatred, and suffering. It is a show that will build you up, break you down, make you laugh, and make you cry. A show that doesn't hesitate to stab you in the emotions, and twist the knife just to make sure.\r\nThe two main characters, after which the show is named, are Romeo and Juliet. Just like the play by Shakesphere, the two meet and fall in love. Unfortunately, their love is that whichwas never meant to be. The story follows this couple as they try to bring peace to their country, and end this horrific reign of corruption and death.\\n\\n\r\nA brilliantly paced and executed show, Romeo x Juliet is definitely a must watch for lovers of the romance/history/drama genres. This emotional rollercoaster will constantly keep you at the edge of your seat, wondering what will happen next.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the art/music isn't anything to write home about, I couldn't think of a better way to have approached it. A Japanese/English rendition of \"Raise Me Up\" by Josh Groban, coupled with beautifully written violin and piano pieces, fit the general tone of the show. The art gives the characters a youthful look, without giving them that \"moe\" (overexaggerated eyes) look that we see in countless shows today. \\n\\n\r\nIf your definition of a romance show is one that contains ecchi/comedy/harem, look elsewhere. You won't find any of that here. Those of you going into this show should know that this is a serious romance that tells the tragic tale of two lovers whose first love was destined to fail the moment they met.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show? You bet. If you are still debating whether or not you should watch this show at this point, just watch it. Trust me, you'll be met with a show that not-your-typical overrated romcom show.",

            "content": "Romeo x Juliet\r\nThis anime shares it's name and renaissance Verona setting with Shakespeare's tragedy. That's where their similarities end. Most of the characters have the same name as the ones in the original work but their personalities, actions and life expectancy are entirely different. Most obvious difference would be that anime Romeo x Juliet follows the structure of greek tragedy as much a Naruto does, and there isn't a trace of that foul and stingy Shakespearean comedy. There might be some scenes that reference the original, but since I'm not a Shakespeare fan, I only recognized a ridiculous balcony scene that serves more as areference pun than a plot advancing scene.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nCapulets ruled Neo Verona until Romeo's dad slaughtered them all except Juliet and usurped the duke's seat. 10 or so years later Juliet is a freedom fighter fighting Montague's tyranny with the help of remaining Capulet supporters. Romeo is a ruler's son flying around worrylessly on his pegasus (yeah, he has one). I will divide the story into three parts: romance, action and fantasy storyline.\\n\r\nFirst would be the romantic storyline that follows Romeo and Juliet's relationship.\\n\r\nIt's a pure love story about them falling in love and transcending social boundaries that separate them. There aren't love-triangles or similar plot devices so I was never frustrated, it's just a really nice and beautiful love story. \\n\r\nLove without much drama sounds boring, but that's where the action/political part kicks in. Neo Verona is under rule of a tyrant so we get to enjoy the suffering of the lower classes and resistance members clashing with the city guards resulting in violent swordplay and high speed chases across the streets and roofs of Neo Verona. We're also shown some court intrigues surrounding Montague and other nobles. I'd compare this part of Romeo x Juliet with Rose of Versailles or BBC/HBO/RAI tv series Rome. Even though it's nowhere near as great as the aforementioned series, it should be an interesting watch for anyone who likes historical dramas infused with some action.\\n\r\nThe fantasy storyline deals with a goddess and a flying continent. Neo Verona is a small continent floating in the sky due to influence of some godly forces that also maintain the natural balance of the continent. This part of RxJ serves almost no purpose until the last two episodes, it is painfully underdeveloped und totally unnecessary. I like fantasy anime and literature but from this sentence on, I will pretend that RxJ has no fantasy stuff except that the horses are replaced with pegasi.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of RxJ is Juliet, one of my favourite female anime characters. She can stand her own in a fight with any male in the series and is a resistance leader loved and respected by both her followers and more passive citizens of Neo Verona. I've watched a lot of anime where \"strong\" girls shut away their feminine side and end up waiting for the wimpy guy to save them when real problems arise, but Juliet is different, she's always true to her emotions and always chooses her own path. It might seem she's a mary sue from what my fanboyish mind wrote above, but I wouldn't classify her as one as she tends to screw up when she's \"choosing her own path\" (though my uderstanding of what mary sue is might be somewhat questionable). \\n\r\nThe other main is obviously Romeo, he's a skinny pacifist that I can't say much about because he's hardly noticeable due to Juliet's awesomeness. \\n\r\nThere's a wide variety of side characters, they probably won't become your favourites but they're fleshed out well enough to keep the story interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation aren't groundbreaking but I find them above average. Neo Verona looks great, it doesn't have Assassins Creed's Florence or Venice level of detail but it still looks beautiful and it's easy to imagine oneself living in it. Charater design is ok, I liked it but there was some \"I've seen these characters before somewhere\" moments. Animation is fluid during the action scenes.\\n\r\nSound is nothing special, japanese voice actors did a solid job, except when pronouncing character's names, but I guess you can't expect a Japanese that doesn't speak italian to pronounce Juliet Fiammata Asto Capulet without any problems. Background music was ok, as I neither felt irritated by it nor felt it's absence. They used Raise me up a couple of times so I had to mute the sound since I hate the song (I also dislike the usage of modern music in mediums that use a quasi historical setting).\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nWhen you remove it's obvious influences from the picture, Romeo x Juliet is a very good action romance anime set in a detailed renaissance-looking city with a loveable heroine and an interesting story featuring political intrigues, revolution and an \"awww\" kind of love. I gave it a 9 because of Juliet being so awesome, but you can considered it an 8 if you think this review sounds too fanboyish in Juliet related parts.\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"For never was a story of more woe than this of Juliet and her Romeo..\" \r\nWell, somewhat. \r\nNow, at first glance, one would think that this was just another adaptation of the tragic/romantic play. \r\nHowever, dear viewers, not all is what it may seem. The creators of this show (and the manga, of which I figure there is one) takes the story and twists it into more of a sort of Hamlet adaptation than a Romeo and Juliet. The forbidden, star-crossed love is still there, but there is now a revenge plot to reclaim what was lost.\r\nEven so, the story was still entrancing, as wereall of the characters. As a Shakespeare fan, I did appreciate a lot of the dialogue as well as the certain nods and nuances to the Bard's play and several characters from his works. Not to mention the Bard himself makes a hilarious cameo.\\n\\n\r\nThe most endearing and appealing part to this show (as well it should be) though, is definitely the two leads. Their interactions are quite heart-felt and incredibly sweet. I will give this show a nod, as it really fleshes out the romance far more than the play ever did. The two characters talk and get to know each other a bit more than the originals did in the entirety of the three days that they knew each other. Even their deaths (oh come on, you knew it would still happen) was far more heartbreaking than it ever was in the play. The play has stupid teenagers not thinking through things. The anime has two young adults sacrificing themselves for the good of all and for love.\\n\\n\r\nAnother creative touch they added to this adaptation was the role reversal of the two leads. It's not Romeo who sneaks into a party, it's Juliet. It's not Romeo who flees to Mantua. It's Juliet. It's quite interesting and a new way to look at the story. I couldn't help but think it made the show far more interesting to see how they would twist the narrative around further.\\n\\n\r\nMy only issue I really had with the show was the way some of the characters were twisted around to benefit the story of this loose adaptation. Sadly, we no longer have the fun-loving witty Mercutio or the villainous, crazed Tybalt. Mercutio was the character I really mourned for. There was a lot of wasted potential on his part. Also, there was a definitive lack of play dialogue. I really was missing one of them saying the famous,\\n\\n\r\n\"My only love sprung from my only hate!!\" \\n\\n\r\nWasted opportunity there, man.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this show is definitely worth a watch, even I would say, for those who love Shakespeare or the play. While it's not a faithful adaptation - heck, it's hardly an adaptation at all - it still retains the spirit and the romance of the play. You still love the characters and you still wish for happiness for the two leads. It's well worth the watch. And you'll definitely either tear up or feel your chest tightening a teeny bit.",

            "content": "As a big Shakespeare fan and an even bigger fan of \"Romeo and Juliet\", I have been wanting to watch this series for quite some time. In order to do this, I had to overcome my initial wariness of all the deviations from the original work. \r\nFrom the noble origins of the main characters to their ties and relationships with all the other characters as well as the names for some new questionable characters (see Lancelot, Ophelia and even... Hermione!?), I was willing to overcome these changes and additions as they would seemingly make for a more interesting and far more developed story than Shakespeare'soriginal work. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, this story was far from being truly original itself, for it not only borrowed from Shakespeare, but also from many other well-known tales such as Robin Hood, Les Mis\u00e9rables, and many others. This could, again, be easily ignored for the sake of entertainment, but as the story progresses, more and more random elements come into play, making the anime drift off farther and farther away from the source material. This becomes truly annoying towards the end, where something like \"The Tree of Life\" from Avatar suddenly appears along with a Mayan-style theme concerning sacrifices. \\n\\n\r\nThis could, again, have been easily ignored if it actually made sense and turned the story into an outstandingly fresh piece of work, but, unfortunately, it didn't.\\n\\n\r\nAs if that wasn't enough, at least 3 characters are spared from dying like they did in the original work, for seemingly no purpose whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the design of Neo Verona itself is also a mix of a bunch of Italy's best sights along with some influence from other countries. Nevertheless, the art and architecture are generally well executed and enjoyable to look at. Although the animation overall is not outstanding, it is definitely pleasant and fits the overall tone of the story pretty well. The only downside to this would probably be the CGI (ugh, those flags!), but thankfully its use is fairly limited. \\n\\n\r\nThe terrible CGI is compensated with some lovely music, where the opening song is used both in Japanese and in English (though I personally prefer the English version and would have liked to see it played more often throughout the series). The ending songs are also nice, and, while nothing memorable, they give a nice look and feel to the show. (Despite people being \"surprised\" about the first ending since it is kind of a rock song, it's perfect for the large amount of action as well as the darker themes that appear in the series). The soundtrack is also well executed, and, again, while nothing outstanding, it certainly does its job pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nAnother strong point of this anime is definitely the voice acting, for it is of great quality (at least in the original Japanese version). Although I was not familiar with any of the seiyuus' work before, I was pleasantly surprised at what they did with Romeo x Juliet and how it all came together so well. This may also be thanks to the pacing, which, for me, was virtually perfect. Neither too fast nor too slow, this anime takes the right amount of time to develop its story and characters (although Tybalt could have certainly used some more time for his backstory and character development). \\n\\n\r\nDespite its mishaps, this anime is definitely enjoyable and one well worth watching. Two pieces of advice, though: try to forget that this has anything to do with Shakespeare and watch out for developing an inevitable addiction! Now, what are you waiting for? Go and immerse yourself in the wonderful world of Neo-Verona, where I'm sure you'll be in for a real anime treat!",

            "content": "For a while now, I've been alternating between watching newer and older anime. While I do think it's important to keep up with the great stuff that's coming out more recently, something I failed to do for quite a while, I also think checking out stuff from the past, especially ones a lot of people haven't seen, is a worthwhile exercise too. I'd heard decently good buzz from other critics on \"Romeo x Juliet\", and I like the Bard alright, so I gave it a watch.\r\nMy highest praise for this series, oddly enough, has to go to the dubbing stuff, most especially the writers. Theyeasily could have just translated the dialogue into English and be done with it, but instead they not only used Shakespeare-appropriate dialogue wherever they could, they also fit it into iambic pentameter, the rhythm of dialogue consistent throughout much of his work. It genuinely elevates the work, not only connecting it better to the source material but also giving the words that some poetic quality that makes a good Shakespeare performance worthwhile. It also goes without saying that the cast is good as well, with Brina Palencia as Juliet herself doing a great job, she really captures both the gravitas and the humanity of the character.\\n\\n\r\nI'm also one-hundred percent behind their alterations to the story. Pulling in other Shakespeare plot elements, such as cross-dressing women and corrupt monarchs who must be overthrown, feels natural, and the way it recasts their romance by changing the power dynamic is interesting. Both leads are also made more compelling characters: Juliet's vigilantism and idealism makes her likable; Romeo's astonishing levels of compassion makes him a cute love interest for her. The very fact that it is Juliet, not Romeo, who leads much of the story is a great way to tell the story. The romance between the two, while still playing heavily on \"Love at First Sight\", develops at a reasonable pace, and I'm happy they spend more than half the series actively in love with the other, and not just pining. The whole plot to overthrow the tyrannical regime also worked well for me, at least in concept.\\n\\n\r\nWhere this series fell flat for me the most was how it handled the conclusion. Rather than develop the strong ideas it had at the start, it instead skipped past much of the intrigue or warcraft to instead tie everything to the science-fiction/fantasy roots of the setting, which I was never a huge fan of in the first place. Neo Verona was okay, but I feel like the story would have worked just as well in something more mundane, the fantasy was never a huge sell for me. By the end, the story gets so far into the minutia of its world that the plot and characters suffer, and with it my interest plummeted. It isn't like this was the prettiest show on the planet (in fact it was fairly middling work from an already lower-rate studio), and while it has a fantastic OP (it took me quite a while to figure out it was a cover of a famous English song) and ED the music isn't something that blew me away either. The ending soured me on the entire experience so much that a series I'd hoped would end up a favorite of mine instead equaled out to just be sort of okay. If you're someone who thinks the premise sounds neat, than I'd recommend giving it a few episodes and seeing if it sticks in your brain, but otherwise it really isn't worth going out of your way to see. It's a fine show, but not a very remarkable one.",

            "content": "What can I say, I pretty much fell in love with it within the first few episodes.\r\nI immediately looked at the plot as soon as I saw the title. I have never read Romeo and Juliet but I know the general story, and I must admit, the plot captured my heart and I started watching it right away. I love the development in the relationship between Romeo and Juliet. A forbidden love that wasn't supposed but did, in a way it was a beautiful thing. I expected to competently follow the original story, but I was quite wrong, it really had a big fantasy elementand I actually think it made the story way better then it would have been if it had followed Shakespeare's original story. A floating island in the sky, a magical tree that keeps that island alive, dragon steeds and godesses are defiantly not part of Shakespeare's work, but it made the anime that much more enjoyable. For me though, as much as it was a \"happy\" and \"exciting\" anime, it was also a bit tragic. There were a few times when I was like \u00b4 \u0414\uff40~noo! but there  were also many times I was like \u2312\u25bd\u2312 ~yay! I won't spoil anything, but the ending really is a moving but tearful one (well, it was for me anyways). \\n\\n\r\nThe art at first ind of caught me off guard. It's like a semi realistic type of anime compared to just normal, skinny, big eyed anime. I honestly didn't like it at first, but you get used to it and in a way it grows on you. The backdrops were nice though, the castles and the rest of the kingdom were drawn really good and it showed the historical element of the show quite well.  As it is, I am a bit of a sucker for historical anime and manga, and when the art doesn't look very historical and nice then I am completely turned off, but this anime was drawn quite appropriately to fit the time period of the anime was set in.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, I give it a thumbs up. The opening them was so beautiful and I sill listen to it now, and every time I hear it all I can think of is the anime. I watched the anime dubbed, so I don't know how the sound was in Japanese, but the actual story of Romeo and Juliet takes place in Europe, so of course the anime did too. So, to suit the time and setting they used the \"Old English\" when talking . Sometimes I found it a bit hard to grasp what they were saying because of the way they talked, but for the most part I understood and it really helped give the anime the historical factor.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the character development. As I said the relationship development between Romeo and Juliet was really good. It was paced just right, never to fast and never to slow. Seeing them fall in love throughout the anime and watching them over come all the hardships and challenges they faced together was great and kept me on the edge of my seat in a way. I also liked how the director didn't try to over include the supporting cast. Sometimes they can be too much and too overpowering for their role but in Romeo X Juliet the supporting cast was there just to be the supporting cast and that was really good. All of the characters did their part in the anime and all fit their role perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think I have made it fairly clear that I very much so enjoyed this anime and it is definitely one of favorites. If you are looking for a great romance and  historical anime with some fantasy and action, you will love Romeo X Juliet! ^.^",

With a twist!~\r\nOn this anime, charming prince Romeo is part of the royal family of Montague, while beatiful Juliet is the rogue helping people, and once a member of the noble Capulet family before her family was murdered. This twist, really got me attracted. It shows the typical romance and trials they had to get past, in this medieval world. It also has mystical creatures and fictional events that come into play. And displays some politics, &  corruption during this time.With all these in, they even add the little romance that Romeo and Juliet had, being the noble and the rogue, they couldn't simply show their love. The ending is the same as the original, sorrowful, it hurt me, I knew that was coming, one reason why I didn't finish it but it's still an amazing, epic story of how a person would go so far for someone they love. Even with that sad part, I still love the anime.\\n\r\n If you love the renaissance period and if you like the plays of Shakespeare, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this one.",

            "content": "Oddly, when I looked it up, some of the cliches made it look very interesting, for whatever reason: a bad dude has massacred a family except for one girl who must learn how to fight and plan to take him over, while she struggles with a love. Meanwhile, there's this dude who's on her side, more or less, but isn't anywhere near as pure-hearted as her and has a much more troubling personal history. What's not to like, right? Well, once I started watching it, it didn't feel that exciting.\r\nStory: It's not at all like the Shakespeare show. The only real similarity is the retentionof Romeo and Juliet names, and the fact that they're from opposing families; they both die, but it's not even with a double suicide. However, if you forget this fact, it's mildly entertaining; the characters are cute and their wanderings at least give something to focus on. It is, however, nothing special; there are a lot of cliches and the characters aren't much good.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is, actually, pretty good; Neo Verona is a very attractive city; particularly worthy of notice is Montague's palace, which has beautifully-rendered halls, courtyard, and more. All the other locations also are nicely-done, and seem very earnest; the mines really look like mines and the abandoned village really looks like an abandoned village. Characters are very cute, with big Honey-and-Clover style eyes, and some have very interesting stylistic points: it can be a sight to see, watching Juliet's hair cascade down every time she removes that wig of hers. Although they are realistic overall, a few of the characters seem color-coded: Juliet's hair and clothes are red; Romeo's are blue; Mercutio's are green; Tybalt's are black, etc.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is nothing special. The background music is not worth focusing on, the OP is subpar compared to those of other anime (particularly Fullmetal Alchemist and Death Note), and the closings are terrible; I mostly didn't even bother to sit through them to see the scenes from the next episode!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Okay, the weakest point of the show. Although the characters are cute, they are really not very well-done at all! My first hint of this came from what the show did to Benvolio. Benvolio is really clueless and stupid; he doesn't even know how to use a broom! It was awhile after when I realized that he wasn't the only one like that; Romeo was no smarter (he gets sent to a mine and farms while Juliet risks her neck). Even Juliet, who is arguably the main character, is an idiot: she keeps getting in trouble and getting rescued by Curio (etc.) or Tybalt, and doesn't emerge triumphant in any undertakings. In fact, the only truly interesting characters are Tybalt and Mercutio. Tybalt gets to have a lot of the action, and Mercutio's ambition and the horrors he faces as a result are well documented. However, they are the only exceptions to the rule that most of the characters are stupid and hard to enjoy; in fact, I may be rare to even like Mercutio!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: As I said before, the show is mildly entertaining on days off. However, compared to other anime, it is nothing special, and is in fact much less enjoyable. I find I enjoy parodies of this show more than the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I did enjoy watching the show, it is not a very good show. I am not a Shakespeare purist and was not expecting a show faithful to the Shakespeare; however, Romeo X Juliet is mediocre even if the fact that it draws from Shakespeare in any kind of way is overlooked. In fact, with stupid characters, a subpar plot, and very little else, it almost seems absurd that the show could take itself so seriously!",

Don't get me wrong, Shakespeare's work is amazing but this has a great twist and time difference.\r\nWell when you first start off watching it, the Artwork is amazing which brings you into the story like its a normal thing other then thinking about \"dragon horse???\" it makes you accept it and other things cause how well it goes into the story.\r\nNow what really got me are the OP & ED theme songs, they are great and this is the first time i actually keep watching it for each episode instead offast-forwarding it.\\n\\n\r\nWell i cant really say much but its a must see. wow i actually said it -.-",

            "content": "To begin with, this is a fantastical remake of the original. Though different, RxJ manages to convincingly simplify and capture the mood and ideas of the Shakespearean original.\r\nStory and Character:\r\nThe first half of the series is a riot of emotions. The story begins with the all-too-familiar scene of love at first sight, secret rendezvous and eventual escape/elopement. Romeo and Juliet are your typical tragic hero and heroine; faced against insurmountable odds, yet remain true to themselves and their beliefs. Makes you wanna root for them. Although this ideal scenario does seem kinda cheesy at times, it makes for good romance. And heck, what's a Romeoand Juliet remake without filling it up with sweet romanticism?\\n\\n\r\nThe second half is a slow and torturous climb to the climax. Here, the main characters, and subsequently you, will suffer their repeated separation and reunion, and their final clash of swords and ideals. The second half can get slightly confusing at times, especially when the fantastical elements come into play. It is also much slower paced compared to the earlier half, which might lead to some impatience from the viewers. My suggestion is to treat it as a deliberate attempt to allow us to understand what the main characters felt when they pined for each other.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, don't be too cynical of the plot (and plot holes) and try to enjoy this for what it is - a love story. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNot fantastic, but no gripes here, except that it can be quite inconsistent.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of classical or instrumental music, you are in for an aural treat. RxJ soundtrack is unbelievably good. This is not surprising since the composer Sakimoto-san also worked on Final Fantasy's and Dragon Quest's soundtracks. The OP and ED were also really well selected. The OP is a soulful Japanese rendition of \"You Raise Me Up\", setting up the mood of the show, while the EDs \"Cyclone\" and \"Goodbye, Yesterday\" fitted the hectic progression in the first half and the painstaking second half. In fact, I recommend listening to its soundtrack and re-imagining the story based on the music alone. Let loose your creativity and come up with your own version of RxJ along with the soundtrack, with each track representing a scene or an act in your imaginary play. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you are looking for a dramatic anime with pure love against stacked odds, look no further.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt seems obligatory that I have to end with a short poetic abstract of RxJ. A tribute to its origins of sorts. \\n\\n\r\n-SPOILER ALERT-\\n\r\n-SPOILER ALERT-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTwo households, both alike in dignity,\\n\r\nIn fair Verona, where laid the scene.\\n\r\nFrom ancient grudge breaks new mutiny,\\n\r\nWhere civil blood made hands unclean.\\n\\n\r\nFrom forth offspring of two foes,\\n\r\nCruel fate brought close their souls.\\n\r\nThrough the fearless journey of their death-marked love,\\n\r\nCould the people of Verona reclaim earth and hearth.\\n\r\nThus the star-crossed lovers staked their life,\\n\r\nWith their death buried all vengeance and strife.\\n\r\nAnd so ceased all suffering, hate, and rage,\\n\r\nA close was brought to this bloodied stage.\\n\\n\r\n\"In life and in death we shall be\\n\r\ntogether forever till eternity.\"\\n\\n\r\n~Romeo x Juliet\\n\\n\r\n-END OF SPOILER- (Don't worry, I doubt it will diminish your watching experience if you do accidentally read this.)\\n",

            "content": "This review will contain one or two spoilers, but they don't give a lot away.\r\nSTORY-6\r\nThe anime does NOT follow the original play by Shakespeare, so if you're hoping for that, watch one of the live action movies or read the play.  In this, Escalus is a tree, okay?  He.  Is.  A.  Tree.  Paris isn't even in this, so there's no fight between him and Romeo which I did miss, but whatever.  The dialogue is close to what they would've said in Shakespeare's day, but, other times, it's more modern.  They do make it so that the averageperson is able to understand what the hell is going on though.  If you haven't read Shakespeare before, it's quite easy to understand when it's being spoken.  Yes, the characters do use really formal language, but you WILL get used to it.  There are also a few plot holes, but they're nothing too major.  If you think of a different solution than the characters, then, yep, you found a plot hole, congratulations.\\n\\n\r\nIt does stick to the Shakespeare ending of his play, but there is a twist to it, BUT, when it happens, you actually will be more understanding of their feelings than in the play.\\n\\n\r\nART-8\\n\r\nThe background was beautifully designed.  The buildings were drawn professionally, I could actually see them being real.  All of the landscapes and buildings actually looked old or new, depending on the age.  Cracks were added to certain structures to add realism while cleanliness was added to the newer structures.  All the fog/mist added to certain scenes added a nice touch to the mood.  The roads were quite detailed, especially the dirt ones, you could see all the tracks etched into it.  The flowers were drawn quite beautifully and, whenver one was on screen, I could help but look at them because they really are eye-catching.  This may just be the pyromaniac in me, but the fire was both realistic and cartoonish at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs left something to be desired compared to the rest of the art.  For example, even though she had to dress up as a boy for so many years, Juliet's design could've been more girlish when she wasn't in her boy's costume.  She just always maintains the boyish aspect in her face and shoulders.  Even before she really knew the truth about her past, Juliet always looked like the war between the Montagues and the Capulets had affected her.  She looked like she remembered her parent's deaths, even though I doubt she did since she was only about two at the time.  I believe that Juliet's constant companion, Cordelia (I believe she was four at the time), should've had a slightly more depressed look since she'd be the best candidate out of the two to remember what had happened that night.  I cannot ignore the fact that Cordelia does have the mature motherly look about her which was a good touch.  In my opinion, the best character design was Montague's.  He looks like the guy who has everything, but still wants more.  His design leaves little to be desired since it fits his personality perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND-9\\n\r\nVoices:  I've seen the series in both English and Japanese and like them both equally.  They both convey about the same amount of emotion and the casts were both fantastic.  It doesn't matter which of the two languages you watch it in, so just go for whatever language you prefer.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:  It fit the mood and the time period almost perfectly.  There were times when it was more like the 1800's or 1900's than the late 1500's or early 1600's.\\n\\n\r\nSound Effects:  All of them were fairly accurate to whatever happened that needed a sound effect.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER-7\\n\r\nThe main characters really do get some development, but I can't really say how much since it varies from character to character.  Most of the characters, even a few of the minor ones, have a backstory and a will that drives them.  You rarely question why they did something.  The only time you come to question them is in the final few episodes when every deision is made within moments that you barely have any idea what they're thinking.  One of the characters I enjoyed watching was William himself since he gave some good advice.  I also enjoyed the Father, especially in episode 5 when he described humans.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters sometimes act predictably, but, it's primarily a shojo, don't expect unpredictable behavior.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT-6\\n\r\nThere were some parts I did like, yet there were a lot of aspects I didn't enjoy.  There were things that didn't make any sense at all.  If you do watch this anime, you just have to go with the flow and acccept everything.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL-7\\n\r\nIt has action for the boys, romance for the girls, it's a great mix.  It doesn't matter if you're a boy or girl to enjoy this anime, if you like twists on original stories, then watch it and don't care what your friends think (yes, boys, I mean you).  Watch it with your husband/wife, girlfriend/boyfriend, group of friends, the household pet, random hobo, whoever you want!  Just go with the flow and, remember, suicide is NEVER the answer.",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that Romeo x Juliet as an anime is far too good for me. This anime in all aspects should be regarded as a masterpiece. This anime is the perfect example of taking a story that has impacted human history, and change things around to make it your own take on it. Romeo x Juliet takes one of William Shakespeare's most famous plays, and does something with it in a way we've never seen before. This is your typical story of two star crossed lovers who do what ever they can to be with each other and either one orboth of them dies. Not only that, but this anime also pays an homage to other Shakespeare plays such as Two Men of Verona, and MacBeth, and even uses Shakespeare himself as a supporting character The animation was done by Studio Gonzo. The studio behind such series as Desert Punk, Black Cat, Afro Samurai, and Basilisk. Romeo x Juliet I think has their best animation by far. Animation on par with Hellsing Ultimate, and Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood. While the music and acting are just your typical anime music and acting I don't think it's bad in this case. There's only so much you can do with that. Onto the characters. Both Romeo and Juliet in this anime are in the same character as they are in the play where as Supporting characters such as Amelia and Marqucio are just standard cliche anime supporting characters. Lord Montegue on the other hand is hands down one of the most thrilling villains I have ever seen in any anime out there. He was so evil, so cunning, and so maniacal, I'm surprised he was made by Gonzo of all people. I enjoyed this anime so much I watched it over the course of a week. I just couldn't put it down. Over all this is by far one of Studio Gonzo's best, and to date the most beautiful anime I've ever seen.",

It was out of boredom that I decided to watch it recently, but I had no expectations of actually enjoying it. How wrong I was proved.\r\nOverall the anime was beautifully written and the spin on Romeo and Juliet was very well done, with many surprising twist that will keep the viewer interested. Juliet's character was well developed and notably was a strong heroinefigure; something that is refreshing to see. Though the art wasn't too much to my complete liking (a bit simplistic for my taste), the story made up for it and kept my interest (admitted there were a few dry episodes in the middle but both the beginning and ending make up for those one or two episodes). I would recommend that people who like romance and a bit of action as well as a some angst watch this. It's well worth it. \\n\\n\r\nThough I would suggest that you make sure you have a box of tissues with you at the end if you're prone to crying easily.",

            "content": "As far as I know, every person in all parts of the world has heard of the Shakespeare story that is Romeo & Juliet, either through reading it while in high school, seen it been parodying a few times on TV, featured on the silver screen with the 1939 George Cukor film, the 1969 Franco Zeffirelli film, the 1996 Baz Luhrmann MTV-inspired film and other numerous amount of films and media that either have parallel situations too many to count (and yes, that does include Romeo Must Die or Gnomeo & Juliet). But what if anime had a turn with the play? Can it turnout to be good or like the Three Musketeers adaptation directed by Paul WS Anderson, it could go downhill from here?\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is still quite similar to the play with some major differences to the play. The Capulets and Montagues are still feuding adversies like in the play but unfortunately for the Capulets, they don\u2019t have a lasting appearance even during the start of the series. Leontes Montague and his men led a bloody coup and murdered every member of the Capulet family, with the exception of one person and yes, it is Juliet Fiammatta Arst De Capulet also known as Odin, when she disguises herself as a boy with short hair. She also masquerades as a vigilante by the name of the Red Whirlwind, who swore to aid the people who suffer from the reign of Lord Montague and his men. However, here comes Romeo Candore De Montague, who is generally the polar opposite of his father. He is kind-hearted, obedient, and noble and as you may guess, he and Juliet start to fall for each other.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is actually quite a change-up for the better. The gender roles here might be switched as the primary focus in the series is Juliet. In other adaptations and the original play, Juliet is mainly the shy and meek girl but in here, she\u2019s a very strong, independent, and well-thought out character and is actually quite likable.\\n\\n\r\nRomeo, on the other hand, is really not that interesting at first, but he does get to that point where everything starts to fall into place. Another change from the play, while Juliet is arranged to be married to Count Paris; in the anime, Romeo is the one to be arranged married with Hermione, a young noblewoman from the House of Borromeo, and yet she\u2019s not really a character from the play. Most of their characters in the story are borrowed from other Shakespeare plays.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters include Cordelia, Juliet\u2019s best friend since childhood and also the representation of the unnamed nurse in the play; Conrad, captain of the Capulet Guards and the one who saved Juliet from the massacre; Francisco and Curio, a duo part of Juliet\u2019s friends who fought alongside her; Tybalt, a mysterious warrior (also a vigilante) also has a deep-seated hatred for Lord Montague (and one of the reasons I can\u2019t reveal to you. It is, after all, a spoiler); Antonio, Juliet\u2019s sidekick; & William, a playwright whose works have not been well-received and also has allusions and pictured as a caricature to William Shakespeare; Benvolio, one of Romeo\u2019s close friends; Mercutio, an sly noble who wants to become Montague\u2019s heir due and soon become mostly like him, mainly because Titus, his father, is an degenerate alcoholic and Mercutio is often ashamed of him.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe only slight problem I had in the series is the villains, who are just insanely evil just to be insanely evil. They obviously don\u2019t care that people are rebelling against them and the fact they are just being dicks. They have no motivation but just to do what they want to do and that\u2019s it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music score is well-made and appropriately goes along with the series. The opening song, \"Inori~You Raise Me Up\u301c\" (\u7948\u308a\u301cYou Raise Me Up\u301c)?) by Lena Park, is a love ballad with some inspirational moments in there, overall, it\u2019s a nice song. I did like the first ending song \"Cyclone\" (\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30f3)?) by 12012 and occasionally I did sort of sing the lyrics by myself\u2026\u2026.horribly. The second ending song \"Good Bye, Yesterday\" by Mizrock is decent but I still like the other one better. I\u2019m surprised GONZO did the animation to this series since I have only previously watched another GONZO-made series (Afro Samurai) and I loved that one.  The animation looks impressive in the first half of the series while some quality drop, it still held its ground.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: It may have gone through some changes in story, characters, and atmosphere; it did work out for the better and leaving only little and meaningless flaws IMO. This is one of the romantic forms of media that doesn\u2019t come off too cheesy, overrated and only alienates different audiences. I really did like this series for what it was. If Hollywood learns to do an adaptation with different elements thrown in and do it right, they should follow Romeo X Juliet\u2019s example.",

While the differences are obvious, the play with which the writers made of the classic script was rather interesting.  Romeo X Juliet is filled with literary references to the original as well as to other works of the Shakespeare.  \r\nOften times side comments made in jest were excuses to allude to actual phrases from the original.  For example, Mercutio telling Hermione that Juliet might havegone after \"the object of her idolatry\" is a direct reference to the following line of Juliet's from Act II of the play  \"Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee\".  \\n\\n\r\nThat is just one taste.  I apologize if this wasn't as useful a review in terms of giving a full account of the anime, but as I said, others have done that well enough.  I just thought this aspect of the anime shouldn't be overlooked for those who enjoy the Elizabethan era writer.\\n\\n\r\nAs an aside:  I did not like the opening theme and any of the similar style of music that sometimes cropped up in the anime.  I just dislike that disney style whitney houston diva singing.  The rest of the soundtrack is fine.",

            "content": "If you were looking for a faithful anime adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, sorry to disappoint this isn't it. Please go watch the 1963 film bc that's the closest you will get to one. \r\nNow I'm not the biggest fan of Romeo and Juliet, mainly because the play is full of too many contrivances and miscommunications and weak characters all mixed in with the most flowery of rhetoric. Now my boy Willy Shakes was never really known for his ability as a story teller but HE IS A MASTER OF LANGUAGE! Shakespeare can take the shittiest story and make it classic because he knew howto use language in such a way that makes it so. \\n\\n\r\nSo, to see an anime adaptation of R+J not only completely turn the story on its head, but actually making our two leads interesting and likeable characters, while also having lines pulled directly from the play and other references to Shakespeare's works? And my boy Lil Will from Stratford upon Avon born and raised is an actual character?! Color me impressed. \\n\\n\r\nLike I said this is not a faithful adaptation, there are a lot of changes from the original play. The capulets and the montegues are not wealthy merchants with a rivalry that no one can fucking explain. Instead the entirety of the capulet family isn't even in the anime; having been the slaughtered ruling family of Neo Verona, ending their rule by the wicked villain montegue, where he ascends to the throne as Neo Verona's ruling tyrant; holding power with an iron fist. Juliet is the sole survivor of the house of Capulet and must hide her identity and disguise herself as a boy until her 16th birthday were all would be revealed. Romeo, being the son of the now dictator prince, is a young man with a gentle soul always looking out for and willingly helping others. He looks upon the oppression of Neo Verona sorrowfully and vows to make things right when he assumes the throne. Juliet must take it upon herself to reclaim her birth rite and free the people of Neo Verona. They fall in love and work together to build a world where they could live in peace without their families names. There are a lot of references to Shakespeare's other plays including character names like Petruchio, Antonio, Cordelia, Ophelia, etc.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, it was pretty solid although there was some jarring CG used in some of the landscape and scenery backgrounds that kind of looked bizarre. There was also the branches of the esscalis tree that were animated with CG and they look like PlayStation 2 graphics, they were pretty bad. The character designs were really nice, and special shout out to my boy tybalt HE IS SOOO FREAKING HOT LIKE DAMN JULIET WHAT YOU DOING WITH ROMEO'S BITCH ASS WHEN YOU GOT THAT BEEFCAKE TYBALT HANGING AROUND YA GIRL!! Yea I sort of developed a crush on him bc he is hot and mysterious and has black hair and momma like her the cool mysterious types. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was absolutely finominal, but I should warn you if you don't like \"You Raise Me Up\" by Josh Grobin you will not be able to stand the score; they play that song like 65% of the time in English, Japanese and instrumental. Also you need to watch this in the English dub bc duh it's Shakespeare! \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime a solid 8. It does loose a couple points for it does slow down a bit halfway through and we get like 3-4 episodes where Romeo is at this mine and tries to start a village with the prisoners who worked in the mine and yea didn't really much care for it. It also lost a point because of the ending. So if you don't want to be spoiled ( but you know how it ends because everyone knows how Romeo and Juliet ends) STOP READING NOW! Go watch the anime!! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOk, WTF was up with that ending. If one thing did not work in this anime is the whole plot with the esscalis tree bc When you think about it, it's fucking stupid. According to Ophelia, there were two trees instead one but one died so Juliet has to die in order to give life back to the tree that's left because it is also dying and the world will crumble and fall if it dies. Romeo dies trying to save Juliet from this fate and kills Ophelia ultimately destroying the esscalis tree. BUT THEN THE BITCH SACRIFICIES HERSELF TO THE FUCKING TREE ANYWAY. Wtf was the point of Romeo dying to protect you of yo ass was going to die to give life to the tree anyway. WHY? And also, NEO VERONA WAS A FUCKING FLOATING ISLAND! The entire reason to save the esscalis tree was because it was the source that kept Neo Verona a float. In the end the city falls anyway and get this, it was a mother flipping island the whole time. Like I don't understand did these people not know? William said they didn't, so what did they think that Neo Verona was the entire world? We're there minds not blown when they touched upon the ocean and saw there was more to their world like wtf? Why was it played off so lightly their world turned out to be a whole bigger than they could ever imagine! The more I think about it, the stupider it gets so I'm just going to chalk it up to being fucking anime. Only in anime man. Thanks for reading the review!",

            "content": "Plot & Story Line \r\nFirst thing's first. The anime doesn't follow the exact story line of Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. There are not two influential families in (Neo) Verona, only one, which is the Montague family. They took over the rule over Neo Verona by slaughtering the whole ruling family, the family of Capulet, 14 years ago. One of the few survivors of that night was the true heir to the throne, Juliet Fiammata Asto Capulet who was later on hidden by loyalists in wish to, one day, overthrow the Montagues and take over the rule over Neo Verona. \r\nJuliet would eventually find outthe truth on her 14th birthday but even though she never knew what had happened to her family she tired to protect the people of Verona as the Red Whirlwind. She is basically a Red, European version of Zorro from the movie The Mask of Zorro (I guess we all know that one).\\n\r\nAnd there's also that part when she meets Romeo, the prince of Neo Verona, son of the man that murdered her family. But of course, they don't know that yet and fall madly in love. In addition to that, an ancient prophecy will also try to get in the way of their love but will they be able to actually 'defy the stars'? Now, in my opinion, the anime would have been truly amazing if it weren't for the prophecy/fantasy part and here's all why. \\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, let's talk about the story in general. It was outstanding. The whole part about hiding Juliet until she is fourteen and then coming up with a plan to take over the throne was both intriguing and exciting. I just love what anime do to classics like this one. Gonzo Studios turned a romance tale into an action/fantasy drama that should definitely be seen. If only I had seen it before but I always though that the anime would be only about the romance. \\n\r\nSecondly, Juliet as the Red Whirlwind was amazing. A strong and fierce swordsman fighting for justice in her hometown. Not only is she accounting for most of the thrilling action in the anime but also building up a strong relationship to her people which would be of uttermost importance in the end of the anime. Her fight for justice is what is giving the people of Neo Verona hope that a better time will come and I was truly happy and excited to see how her destiny literary guides her all the time. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance was of course an indispensable part of the story and it was as cheesy as I expected it to be, but it was still nice. Their relationship might look like love at first sight but you can actually see how it develops trough the anime. It is not forced nor rushed and as cheesy as it might be I must admit that I enjoyed it for most of the time. \\n\r\nAnd now the part that I didn't like that much. As the anime progresses, a prophecy is slowly introduced to the viewers in a really intriguing way and I was definitely excited to see where it goes. But as it turned into a supernatural/fantasy I slowly lost interest. Not because it was bad, I love fantasy, but it just didn't fit into the whole story. It was too much and in my opinion the anime would have been ten times better if it stayed that way. A realistic setting of two families fighting for the throne and a young love in between was truly enough for Romeo x Juliet to be a masterpiece, but it was not. \\n\r\nStill, I cannot deny that the story is brilliant with or without the fantasy part and I'd really like to add that it is better than most of the anime stories I have seen recently. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nI might not remember the Juliet from Shakespeare's play, it's been way too long since I read it but I definitely love the anime version of her. As I said in many of my posts, my favorite type of characters are those amazing, fierce, strong and independent female characters and Juliet definitely made it to the top. She is all that and still a sweet and caring person that is not afraid to take the lead when it comes to fighting for her people. Romeo's personality was just as great. Just a sweet, down-to-earth prince that is trying to change the way his father rules over Verona. He was a great support to Juliet and a well written character despite his somewhat cliche personality. Many of the side characters were equally as well presented in the anime and I'd like to mention three: Cordelia, who was a mother/older sister figure for Juliet. She was such a sweet character and a great support to Juliet in her hardest times. Tybalt is a mysterious character that joins the Capulets later in the show. It is his secretive personality and his history that make him stood out among the other characters And in the end, Romeo's father Laertes Montague.  From the looks to his behavior, he was the perfect antagonist and scary as hell if I may add.  \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Style\\n\r\nIt is really interesting to see how the design of anime animation evolves from let's say the 1990's over the 2000's and from the 2010's to now. Just by looking at the design,  not the animation quality, you can predict what year an anime is approximately from. What I dislike about Romeo x Juliet is not the animation quality (it is 2007 so I cannot compare it to today's animation) but the dull colors in the anime. I have the feeling that the makers somehow decreased the saturation of the whole anime. Still, I must mention that there are many beautiful scenes and backgrounds in the anime that I loved especially the flower beds. The character design was also great so on the whole, the animation and style were actually pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nThe story of Romeo and Juliet has been told so many times but is seems that the world will never get enough of it. Tragic or not (no spoilers \ud83d\ude09), it is a story that gives people hope that love can defeat any evil. Romeo x Juliet is the same yet a completely different tale set in a fantasy version of Verona that is waiting for the return of the righteous heir of the throne, the daughter of Capulet. The story is so much more than a simple drama or romance. It is a story about freedom in every sense of this word that is both emotional and thrilling at the same time. I might not like the fantasy part about the prophecy, thinking that the story would have been better if it remained in a somewhat realistic setting, but it still far from not being good. It was amazing. \\n\r\nSo, to all you having doubts that Romeo x Juliet is just a cheesy romance anime, it is. But it is at the same time so much more. Don't miss it, I am sure that you will enjoy it as much as I did.",

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\n\u2726Story\r\nHmm, what can I say. To be honest I've never seen any of the more \"classical\" adaptions of Romeo X Juliet story, nor the original. So this is for the most part my first experience with such story. It's possible I've seen similar things but simply with different title. Point here remains that this is my actual first \"Romeo X Juliet\" experience.\r\nAnyhow, I did find the progression in the story just fine. Although the contents I found oddly boring. It is suppose to be tragic love story.Which I understand, especially how it was bound to be wrapped up, but in the end became less tragic.\\n\\n\r\nBiggest question here still for me is. Why is their relationship tragic, why should offsprings care what their parents did. I just cannot understand it. I mean, if my love of the life would be actually a daughter of a serial murderer that also killed my family. I just wouldn't care, yes hate probably the criminal, but that would be limited to that criminal. Not automatically hate the whole family tree. Same as with respect, is with hate. To get it, you have to earn it.\\n\\n\r\nAside that, I can say, I finished this series instead of dropping for a very simple stories. I absolutely love love, and idealize and thrive for vanilla love. So in that aspect it was enjoyable show. Had some cute scenes and their relationship was okay for the most part. But yeah as mentioned, for the most part I found the story and lot of plot points quite moronic if not annoying.\\n\\n\r\nMoral of the story is that story wasn't bad, it just didn't impress me.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art & Sound\\n\r\nVisuals were okay. Good enough.\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, once again, writing review weeks after finishing the series, which means I cannot really remember details anymore. And I cannot  remember it being either bad or good. So probably that means most of the tracks were okay'ish. But some had actually quite a presence, which means \"sound\" aspect was good enough.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\r\nWell, not fan of whole \"stage play\" acting. Find em oddly annoying. Especially by how they speak or act. Thankfully this anime didn't have such \"acting\" as much I imagined it would have. But to be honest, no characters really impressed me.\\n\\n\r\nProbably only one I can think of is that theater story writer. Rest were either boring just simply with no presence.\\n\\n\r\nOur main coupling wasn't as interesting either. There was some growth and progression regarding the characters within the story, but in the end I found the characters \"meh\" valued.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nTo sum it up all. It was quite a mediocre series for me. Didn't enjoy much, saw multiple stupid elements, didn't really get into characters nor in general got much impressed.\\n\\n\r\nAs said, if this series wouldn't had romance element (+vanilla coupling) I would quite likely dropped it by the episode of 10. So yeah, some cute moments. Sums it up for me.",

            "content": "This anime is an adaptation of William Shakespeare\u2019s novel of the same name without the X for those who do not know. The most obvious difference it is more in-lined with fantasy, semi-action and of course the romance/drama genre.\r\nIts story simple if you read or know the novel, it is basically like this: two families, war, unrest, lovers, romance and death those are its main concepts. The flow of the story is more like the simple introduction, conflict, climax, conclusion and ending. The built up or the pacing is quiet slow and more on story based than action. However it has its different approach onconcept it\u2019s more modern or somewhat does not follow the stereotypical damsel in distress and other clich\u00e9s the characters are okay and easily understandable. The plot is good with mix of fantasy and a few turn of events that are obvious on what\u2019s going to happen but nevertheless quite fascinating. The romance on this anime is plain a bit cheesy but still quiet romantic depending on the viewers. Next is the action element, the fight and death scenes are bit mild it just adds a dramatic effect on the stories events for example duel of handsome guys or a display of martyrdom. As for the music the opening song and the BGM is good but I like the ending song it has a somewhat rock. Although the BGM is good it still lacks a certain vibe. The characters voice actors are good. The art style and . How the characters are portrayed are more on the typical but not totally clich\u00e9 but still retain their distinct features and personality that are unique in a way. The anime is more story oriented or it focuses on the drama and romance rather than action. I may recommend \\n",

            "content": "NOTE: THERE WILL BE MANY SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW!\r\n             From the intricate plot of the story to the emotional characters, to the greatly-drawn characters, and to the great background music,this anime has to be one of my favorites, or perhaps even rank number one on the anime list on MyAnimeList.Net. \r\n              The story of this anime, as mentioned before in the previous paragraph, was weaved together intricatelywith each event &quot;fitting&quot; perfectly with the next (that may not have made much sense, but what I was trying to say was that the events in the story are very well made). One such example of a perfect &quot;fitting&quot; event would be at the beginning when Juliet arrived at home, took off her hat, and got her hair brushed by Cordelia. This event was soon followed by the introduction of other characters, and so it fitted with the story. The only one aspect of the plot of Romeo x Juliet which I did not like was the introduction and the explanation of Escalus, the tree &quot;goddess&quot;. I didn't like it because the artists or director of this anime only used a few short scenes to explain what Escalus really was. It would've been better if the director spent half of an episode to explain the origins of Escalus, or how Escalus actually works, etc...Besides from Escalus, I thought that the plot of RomeoxJuliet was excellent.\\n\r\n               I thought that the art of this anime was somehow different than any of the other art in other animes because of many reasons. First, the eyes of the characters were drawn with less emphasis on the eyes; this is different from those &quot;sparkly&quot; characters from other romance anime. Second, the action scenes were much better drawn because more colors were used to emphasize blood, or other &quot;casualties&quot; of fighting. One such example of this is the ending, when Romeo bled and blood fell out from his body. The blood from his body were well-detailed. \\n\r\n                Lastly, the characters and the sound of the story had many strong points and many weak points to them. I will explain the sound first. The background music of the anime gave me the feeling of that scene. One such example was when Romeo and Juliet lived in that village. The music of that scene was sad, but at the same time it had a loving feeling to it. That made me feel very connected to how Romeo and Juliet were feeling about each other. I didn't really like the background music of the ending scene because it gave me tears :D!!! I thought that the characters of Romeo and Juliet were very well-made to fit into the environment of the anime. This is probably because the director made the character do certain things that would fit into the story, such as having them go to balls and fighting. If the director were to make them practice magic with a staff (like the ones in Mahou Sensei Negima), then the characters would've been an &quot;awkward&quot; addition to the story. Asides from the two main characters, I thought that the other characters were very well detail, except for the gardener of Escalus. As mentioned in the plot paragraph, the director or artists of this anime did not really focus much on Escalus and how it works. This explanation would go toward the gardener character, too. \\n\r\n                   Overall, I thought this anime was a very sweet, tender, and loving anime that anyone can learn to love. Romeo. Juliet. Forever. \\n",

            "content": "Well, to start... I was in the mood to watch romance, once in a while, so I just picked randomly. \r\nI already seen Gankutsuou... I didn't expect this to be a close version of the piece anyway, but this.is.genius. It's just as non-european as it possible for a european setting. That was the only thing entertaining me all 24 eps. Starting from gestures and etiquette and ending with philosophy. \r\nThe plot... Well, what's with it again? Yep, they took a piece and put it into a shredder. One family killed the other. But the heiress survived. Now, begone, old tyrant. I was more enjoying analyzingthe probable outcome of Lord Montague social politics if it was happening in real life than actually following the second part of story... Something with tree of life. Yeah. Those who died, died. Those who didn't bothered, lived happily ever after in a candyland. Why taking story on a floating island, no idea. Nothing could possibly change if it was happening on the Earth surface. But then again, it's anime. Everything is fancier with winged horses. Makes me wonder, why no one bothered to bring on a katana, because everything is even more exciting with it. Oh, and battle scenes are epic. In a kind when character can make a long-term speech while other swing a sword. And the first one still get to dodge after finishing. \\n\r\nNot like I'm a Shakespeare fan. I've only read the original story once, back when I was a teen. But while watching, I really wanted to open the book and search through to finally understand where the hell they took that weird cast from. The author avatar *Willy* was the most annoying thing ever... To the point of not being funny annoying. Srsly, get some respect to the writer maybe?\\n\r\nI'm not the one to judge the soundtrack, but well... It was at least bearable. No earworms. No dissonance. Rarely noticeable, actually. I'm fine with it tho.\\n\r\nSo, in the end:\\n\r\n\"+\"  Pretty funny story that doesn't affect brain. Everything you would expect from a typical shojo anime (SIC!) in fantasy-Middle-age entourage. No unpredictable turns... But then again, no desire to try and predict something. What politics? What war? What plot? Hey, they look so sweet together.\\n\r\n\"-\" If clich\u00e9 put you in a bad mood, you'd better not to come close... If you're thinking when you're watching, avoid this of all costs. And hey, their logic makes you facepalm so hard. I nearly broke my nerdy glasses doing so.",

Review #34: Romeo x Juliet\r\nTwo households, both alike in dignity,\r\nIn fair Verona, where we lay our scene,\r\nFrom ancient grudge break to new mutiny,\r\nWhere civil blood makes civil hands unclean.\r\nFrom forth the fatal loins of these two foes\r\nA pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;\r\nWhose misadventured piteous overthrows\r\nDoth with their death bury their parents' strife.\r\nThe fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,\r\nAnd the continuance of their parents' rage,\r\nWhich, but their children's end, nought could remove,\r\nIs now the two hours' traffic of our stage;\r\nThe which if you with patient ears attend,\r\nWhat here shall miss,our toil shall strive to mend.\\n\\n\r\nAh, William Shakespeare, he sure has his way with words. Both poetic and HARD TO UNDERSTAND AT TIMES! Thank God for footnotes in later editions of his plays! Well, today is Valentine\u2019s Day and I thought I\u2019d do a special review today for this occasion. Since it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day, I decided to review Romeo x Juliet, obviously an anime adaptation of Romeo and Juliet from William Shakespeare. I have seen this anime twice and I\u2019ve read the play. This is Shakespeare\u2019s famous tragic love story and I think it is somewhat fitting that I\u2019d review this on this day. With that said, let\u2019s celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day with Romeo x Juliet!\\n\\n\r\nThis is a story of a young and tragic love, set in the aerial city of Neo Verona in the skies above. Tyranny rules this island in the sky after the Montague family took control 14 years prior when all seemed dire. The disparity among the wealthy and poor is apparent in the present state, the earth dries and water stagnates. The sky itself is wrapped in a deep dense fog. Both Romeo and Juliet's lineages are of present and past ruling families of Neo Verona. Romeo is the son of the current Montague dictator, Juliet (a beautiful woman) masquerades as a man she's the last descendent of Capulet the previous rulers who were killed by an assasin's dagger 14 years ago. Her true background is not to be revealed to her until her 16th birthday. The cruel hands of fate introduces 2 people who will become \"Star Crossed Lovers\".\\n\\n\r\nTo be technical, this is a Studio Gonzo production and I was skeptical at first when I saw this series and thank God that this series doesn't suffer from the usual crap that Gonzo is known for with it poor iteration of 2D and 3D animation. The animation is excusable this time for Gonzo regarding Romeo x Juliet\\n\\n\r\nThe music is something worth mentioning and something not to be ignored. It is composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto who was well known for the soundtracks of Final Fantasy Tactics and Final Fantasy XII. The music by Sakimoto-san is just great. It compliments nearly every scene giving some scenes emotional impact. I have played Final Fantasy XII and I really enjoyed the grand scale to that soundtrack while playing that game even though combat was a real slow pain in the ass to deal with. Now that Romeo x Juliet's soundtrack is done by this composer, it doesn't call too much attention but I can say the score is phenomenal. It is near-perfect and the only thing that bumps the music's chords is the first closing theme\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is a play written hundreds of years ago and I honestly think this closing theme was unfitting to the entire show. I mean, Rock music in a Romeo and Juliet adaptation? Why? Why was this in there? The song is great outside the show, but in the show... I don't think it fits at all. The second closing theme on the other hand is okay for the most part. Then there's the opening \"Inori - You Raise Me Up\" which was sung by Korean-American singer Lena Park. For any music buffs out there. \"You Raise Me Up\" was originally done by the duo Secret Garden with Brendan Graham as the lyricist and Rolf L\u00f8vland as the composer. You might be familiar with the song by Josh Groban which he did cover the song a year after it was originally written. It is sung as a contemporary hymn in church services. I sure like to hear that when I'm attending church. Now that I've digressed about the opening for a bit, allow me to tell you what I thought of the opening. Lena Park was terrific for her cover on this song. It is sung in Japanese in the opening. It is also sung in English for Episode 7 and the Final Episode. I don't know what else to say about her cover, it's just very good.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to voice acting, Get ready to boo and yell at me for saying this but please hear my plea even in discontent. This show is extremely fitting in the dub. Hear me out O purists or question me from thee jurists! This play was originally written in Modern English by William Shakespeare himself, so it would only be fitting to at least watch the dub for that. There's nothing wrong with the Japanese cast in the show. Takahiro Mizushima is fine as Romeo, Fumie Mizusawa is also fine as Juliet. If there's any standout performances in this version, that would be Koji Ishii as Montague and Kazuhiko Inoue as William (Yes, William Shakespeare is a character in this show. yeah...just go with it) This version also has Ryotaro Okiayu, Keiji Fujiwara, and Toru Ohkawa. With the dub, there's Chris Burnett as Romeo in which he sounds a bit dull but it's not his fault because he actually plays a good Romeo, Brina Palencia plays a terrific Juliet, As far as some standout performances in the dub, there's Colleen Clinkenbeard as Cordelia, J.Michael Tatum plays a terrific William, Maxey Whitehead is great as Antonio. Mike McFarland is also great as Tybalt. Sean Hannigan is the highlight of the dub as Montague. What makes the dub great in this anime is that they have some Shakespearean-like dialogue but the only problem in the dub is that it's not constant, you'll have to pay attention with your ears on that part though. The Japanese script does use some Shakespearean dialogue albiet in Japanese. Both versions are good but I strongly prefer the dub here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters, some of the characters act a bit different than the original play. There are some characters in this anime that are not even from the original play which I don't understand why they are included in this adaptation, but oh well. There's Ophelia, Camilo, and Petruchio which the names are most likely nods to Shakespeare's plays such as Hamlet, The Winter's Tale, and The Taming of the Shrew. The only character that's not a nod to any of Shakespeare's plays that is exclusive to this adaptation is Giovanni (and hey, that just so happens to be my first name I kid you not) Some of these characters exclusive to this adaptation are alright but I don't know what else to say about them really. The characters are great even though the characters based off the play do act a bit differently than the original play.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf the name \"Neo-Verona\", flying steeds, or the fact that William Shakespeare is a character in this adaptation wasn't enough proof that this isn't really a faithful adaptation to Shakespeare's tragic love story, then allow me to do some explaining. This is a more modernized, alternate telling with some fantasy settings.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis loose adaptation may not sit well for fans of the original play and if you think this is the only adaptation that is much different than the original play, Allow me to mention another adaptation called Romeo + Juliet, a 1996 film starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Romeo and Claire Danes as Juliet. The Montagues and Capulets are portrayed as warring business empires and instead of swords, there are guns in that adaptation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSome may not like that movie and I don't hear many people bitch about this movie and I have that same impression towards this loose adaptation of William Shakespeare's tragic love story. If there is something worth mentioning about this adaptation that some people do tend to overlook is that there are a lot of double entendres in the original play. If I were writing this play like Shakespeare would, such an example would be \"I standeth with my sword raised high and I shall use mine sword to cut the maiden's head and I shall beareth that burden till the moment to die.\" these double entendres in the play were sexual and that example I just pointed out is in a manner as such. Call me a pervert if you wish, but hey... Shakespeare was kind of a pervert too and he got away with it too. Speaking of double entendres, there is no such a thing in this adaptation, making it the most sexually pure adaptation of Romeo and Juliet so far. Unfortunately, this adaptation isn't perfect though because even though the play is brilliant, there is one thing I can point out that they could have stuck to, and that is the ending. This adaptation does not have the tragic ending that the play was unanimously well-known for. This adaptation has more of a happy ending which I can't guarantee fans of the original play will like. I almost didn't like the ending, but I later found myself liking this adaptation's ending. What this adaptation stays true is that it contains the spirit of the original play it was based on even though it does not have the tragic ending. Reiko Yoshida took many liberties with Shakespeare's original play and makes it differ extensively and Fumitoshi Oizaki's direction isn't perfect but it isn't sloppy. Also, J. Michael Tatum deserves some credit for the ADR direction as well as R. Bruce Elliot for the dub. Kinda fitting that J.Michael Tatum was the ADR director for 2/3 of the show since he was the English voice of Shakespeare. With all the words I've writ, I bid this review adieu.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRomeo x Juliet is available from Funimation. The manga written my Reiko Yoshida is available by Yen Press. Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare is available freaking anywhere and I'm certain you possibly read it at high school or college unless you somehow didn't get to read it in class. There are a number of film adaptations of the play which I don't care to list them all down because this would just make the epilogue much longer and there's not much ado about nothing that I even want to discuss all the movies. Look them up at your own leisure.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, Romeo x Juliet is a surprise adaptation of William Shakespeare's tragic love story which is a masterpiece by all means. I love this play. While this anime takes many liberties with Shakespeare's play, it has beautiful imagery for the most part with Gonzo's humble approach, it has a wonderful soundtrack, it has great characters even if they act different than they did in the original play, and the story is great (for an alternate telling that is). You might be skeptical at first, if you give this a try... you might be surprised on how good this loose adaptation can be.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI give Romeo x Juliet a 9.1 out of 10. It is EXCELLENT!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to comment below, and celebrate this day with LOVE AND PEACE!",

            "content": "to preclude the review, it is very important to note that while the anime says that it is based off shakespeare's play, it is only very loosely based on the actual plot while maintaining the fundamental aspects that make it a classic. that being said, i'm sure that viewers will have already developed a preset opinion on what will happen and that might disillusion them to the unique twist that this anime provides for the story of romeo and juliet.\r\nstory: the romance between romeo and juliet proceeds very quickly, and the anime does well to portray the idea that beyond the chaos and deception thatplagues their lives, they give their sanity away in pursuit of unrequited love -- bound for eternity. it is a very touching story given juliet's conflict between upholding her birthright and rejecting the one she desires most. romeo and juliet's will to compromise in order to be together no matter what circumstances is the idea weaved throughout the entire story. however, the ending is extremely bizarre and abruptly introduced. while it was hinted at several time, the sci-fi nature and awkward clash with the setting is very off-putting. also a few episodes are wasted on introducing characters whom are hardly important to the overall plot. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nart: the art matches exactly what one might presume of \"Neo Verona.\" it is very lavish yet the beauty lies with the simplicity. the art is clean and polished and definitely fits with the elizabethan feel the anime was going for. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nsound: much like the art, the sound only further adds to the wonders of the anime. the orchestral music crescendos in suspenseful situations and decrescendos in moments of sadness; overall, the music dynamics are used sparingly but definitely when necessary. the soundtrack adds to the romantic feeling, and the opening song as the japanese version of \"you raise me up\" is fitting for the support that the characters provide for each other. 10/10\\n\\n\r\ncharacter:\\n\r\ndespite juliet being the sole heir to the capulet name, she does not exhibit the stereotypical qualities of snobbishness and ungratefulness that one might assume of a noble. in fact, her humble upbringing is probably why she is filled with justice and valiance. when she meets romeo, at first, their relationship spirals into her constantly becoming dejected but at the end their bond only strengthens their willpower. romeo also at first seems to be passive with the situation with his father but the character development later on shows him to be a brave fighter. the \"villains\" of the anime aren't characterized as outlandishly evil; they all have an inner depth to them that justifies why they act the way they do. the only problem is that some characters are highly overlooked and neglected because of how much standing juliet and other characters have as the high-ranking leaders. there are also characters whom are introduced that do not serve any purpose at all but to fill the plot. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment:\\n\r\ni definitely enjoyed romeoxjuliet and sympathized with the romantic struggle that juliet and romeo suffered together because of their misfortune of being born on opposing sides family-wise. i rejoiced when the civilians got retribution for the inequities of their life and enjoyed the side banter and comedic relief that other characters provided. however, i was rather deterred because of the ending which took me by surprise in a \"this is related to the story... how?\" kind of way which made me leaving the anime a bit disappointed because the story thus far was stunning\\n\\n\r\noverall:\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nit is a work of its own although it shares a common name with shakespeare's play.\\n",

            "content": "Ah, doesn\u2019t everyone just love an adaptation of Romeo and Juliet by the ever famous play writer William Shakespeare? I can\u2019t really say I do, because if there\u2019s one genre I can\u2019t stand, it\u2019s romance. Well, kind of. I\u2019ll never pass up an opportunity to do a little character shipping or see some really sweet scenes, but soppy romance just makes me want to throw up. Romeo and Juliet is FULL to the brim of soppy romance, so I guess I am inclined to give this anime a lower score. \r\nLet\u2019s start off with the story. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, and heavily impliedthrough the title, this is an adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. Needless to say, it has the same basic plot line. For that plot line, I would give a 5. However, I\u2019m able to move that score up one notch because of the differences presented between this one and the original. I really did like the new setting of Neo Verona, in a sort of future environment, that the Capulets have been almost obliterated. In short, I found the numerous tweaks on the story intriguing and ultimately better than the original (gotta say, I\u2019m not a huge fan of Shakespeare, possibly because of the amount of plays bearing his signature I\u2019ve had to study and will have to study in the future). I add one more point to the score because of the plot twists. No, setting it in a different environment and shaking up the story weren\u2019t enough - we also discover that the natures of characters are not as it may have seemed - they are actually quite complicated. \\n\r\nHowever, this is another failed ending. While it does include some of the tragedy of the original play, it doesn\u2019t make that much sense. It\u2019s nowhere as confusing as the ending of Kyoukai no Kanata, but it\u2019s still puzzling and kind of disappointing. I would use this to bring the story down by 0.5, but since I\u2019m feeling nice today, I won\u2019t. \\n\\n\r\nNext comes art. It\u2019s quite obvious that this was a low budget anime. The art style isn\u2019t too dreadful, in fact scenery and particularly buildings come out quite nicely, but the characters\u2026 Well, they\u2019re not that dreadful. For once, they look much too old, and they do not bear the traditional anime-style traits. I will admit that some characters are cute and/or mildly good-looking (I think \u2018mildly hot\u2019 would be a little bit of a contradiction - don\u2019t you?), but the rest, well, I can only say one word - Meh. A big fat \u2018meh\u2019. Juliet looks nice, I would say, only in the opening when she has hair up and is shouting. But, I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder. No more than a 6 in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nMusic was okay, I really don\u2019t have much to say about this subject. I liked the first ending theme. Perhaps it\u2019s because I have so little to say about this that I give it a 5.5. \\n\\n\r\nNext comes character. This is perhaps the first time I am criticising character because of a different factor other than development. The character development here was decent, it was okay. No it\u2019s not that which caused me to give this a 5. In fact, I could almost say that it\u2019s because of the character development that I give this a 5. Now I\u2019m starting to sound like someone who is never happy, which is not the case, so let me explain.\\n\r\nI\u2019m aiming mainly at Juliet here. Her character is sometimes so grown up and other times so childish I firmly believe that her age changes constantly between 5 and 30. I watched this anime with my dad, and most of our time was spent yelling at Juliet and laughing at her ridiculous decisions. She may be good in battle, but in strategy, even I, the person who never plans, am better at her in seeing future scenarios. She makes such stupid decisions at times, what are supposed to be dramatic scenes turn plainly comical.  \\n\r\nShe is also so lovestruck with Romeo, it\u2019s past hilarious. While he is also in love with her, his case is nowhere near as bad. \\n\r\nI also think that too many characters have little or no relevance to the plot. For instance, Regan, or Hermione. And I LIKE Regan, so I\u2019m not being biased her. I also think that Antonio could claim child abuse. I mean, making that tiny, little, cutie-pumpkin fight? It\u2019s criminal.\\n\r\nRomeo is also one of those perpetually lucky protagonists, which is another cliche element that I cannot tolerate. \\n\r\nSometimes I think that the most decent character in the anime is Cielo - the dragonsteed (a horse with wings). *scoffs* \\n\r\nReally, some characters made this anime comical, which I don\u2019t think was intended. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, while this was an interesting adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, it did have some confusing elements, okay art, and sometimes ridiculous characters. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10 (would give 6.5)\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nMusic: 5.5/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10 (I\u2019m being nice here)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.9/10 (rounded to a 6)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nA/N: Thank you to all those who have commented on my reviews! I hope to make them consistently better, and only you can help me do that. Thank you in advance. \\n",

I thought to myself why would i watch it if i had already seen the life action. So i decided to give it a try and I must say it WASN'T like the original story at all.\r\nStory: The story was interesting and like i said, it wasn't like the original story at all. The first half of the series was addicting and keep me happy and it was sweet. However, I felt that the second half of theseries drag on and there were a lot of unnecessary content.The feeling you feel from the first half is not going to be the same in the second half of the series. I also felt like it could have finished like 5 or 6 episodes early.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Eh, i would say that it has that 90s-2000s feelings. The character has everything right. Body size,eyes,boobs,etc\\n\\n\r\nSound: I was impress with the sound. It sounded like i imagine it would. It has that medieval music?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: For an anime with a lot of key players. I have to say that they were developed nicely.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I would say go for this anime, Even if your not a fan of Shakespeare. The story was different, the sound(or music?) was amazing and it fitted in. I would have to say that it does get a bit drag on. But still, even with the second half of the series flaws, it was still an amazing series to watch.\\n\\n\\n",

Supposly the Montagues and Caplets live on floating islands in the clouds and there is some war betten the two of them. It's got fantasy with the white winged horses and if you notice on the trailer that right after Romeo flys down on his horse he meet Juliet's gaze, and they both share a moment and then right then they KISS!! Gosh, so quick. (LAUGHS) but it's sooooooooooooooooooooo cute KAWAII!!!! The story isnt like the orignal Romeo and Juliet but that is GONZO and they do a great job makingit their own.",

            "content": "So yeah. We all know the tragic story of Romeo and Juliet; The son and daughter of rivalling families who fall in love with one another. We all know the cheesy crap the said to each other. Pain, hatred, sadness and a love that could not be. Nothing new about that. So with that said, it may seem impossible to make an interesting anime out of it. Without boring people with corny, overused vows and predictable plotlines. However, Romeo x Juliet proved the opposite to me.\r\nStory:\r\nThe first thing I liked about this story already was the fact that the 'Mysterious Hero' in this story, isthe girl. It's the girl who saves innocent townpeople in distress. It's the girl that risks her own life in order to save other's. All that, while in the beginning, the boy is more of a wuss. A very kind wuss though. =] Apart from that, the story didn't seem to be all that promising from the start. The first few episodes were a little bit predictable. Boy meets girl, girl meets boy, fall in love, and then find out it's an impossible love and all that stuff, but it got way more interesting after a few episodes. The story gradually unfolds in a way that's easy to follow, yet not slow. Turns out there's a lot more to it than Shakespeare's original play.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nOkay, initially, I had a little problem with the art style. But as soon as I got used to it, I also came to love it. It's way more realistic than all of those huge-eye-animes, and that suits the story as well. (I'm not saying the story's realistic though, it's fantasy after all. ^^ But the feelings of most of the characters were illustrated very realistic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nSometimes I get a little tired of anime where every character looks identical except fot their hairstyle and -colour and their eyecolour. It's really refreshing to see something like Romeo x Juliet once in a while, where you could immediately recognize each character just by looking at them, even it they were wearing a wig and colour contacts. \\n\r\nBased on character design, there are three sorts of anime: Anime where every single person is pretty. Most of the time I find anime like that pretty annoying, but in cases like Clannad, Ef, or Nana, I can get over it. Second, there are anime where all the goodies are beautiful and the baddies are ugly. (Even more annoying, if you ask me). And last, there are anime where characters looking ugly can still be good guys, including handsome bastards. Romeo x Juliet belongs to the last sort, and also the most realistic sort. Even better is the fact that basically there are no real goodies or baddies. Most of the bad guys just do what they're told because they're scared, and even the biggest badass is not completely evil. It's no good or evil. Just people like you and me who do good and bad stuff. That's the way I like it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis is the very best anime I saw ever since Clannad, and I can recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good love story. It got me in a really romantic mood, and sometimes; I just wanted to hug my laptop. It didn't brought me to tears, but I think this should be able to make somebody cry. For the anime-boy-fangirls among us, there's plenty of drooling materials with Francisco, Tybalt and Romeo himself. However, if you want bouncing breasts and 'accidental' panty-shots, you shouldn't bother wasting your time watching this until you grow up.",

Although I have read only up to Act 2 of the original Romeo and Juliet script in the past therefore not qualifying to be able to differentiate and criticize between the original and this version, I find this anime entirely amazing and utterly stunning out of all other animes I have watched. There are many changes though, because it is only loosely based on Shakespeare's work. Also, I was completely hooked that it was almost as though it wasn'tjust an anime anymore. xD\\n\r\nIt's just out of the ordinary.\\n\r\nTo be honest though, the only points I didn't like about it was that there was rarely any humor, and instead, it was all seeerious like Peach Girl. But that makes it appropriate and well-suited to the whole plot, story and background anyway. If it was comical whatsoever in any way it would've been a joke altogether.\\n\r\nAlso, sometimes there are scenes of violence that I can't stand. At least they don't display the actual sight of the bloodshed, but the way they present the scene in those moments just send shivers down my spine. ._.\\n\r\nWhatever, overall, it left me with a huge overall impression.\\n\r\nI definitely recommend this anime to, well, entirely everyone.",

            "content": "Story: about 6.8, really, but 7 was a bit too high.\r\nAs has been mentioned, RxJ is an adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. I too, would like to draw attention to the word ADAPTATION. Meaning, any Shakespeare purists who would complain about a butchering of Shakespeare's original, should steer clear, now. From the first episode, it is evident that the plot is totally different, and this really could have been a very good thing. \r\nInstead, two key things were not handled well, and it turned out to be at best a good thing, with misgivings. First, if they're going to throw in the Tree subplot(ifyou watch, you'll see what this means by about the middle(around episode 12?)), please explain it better throughout, and not toss in the hurried explanation towards the end. I personally am very fond of fantasy stories, and appreciated the explanation about the tree's purpose(if you've read JRR Tolkien's the Silmarillion, it parallels a part of this). The random :cough: gardener was also...random, and severely underdeveloped. Her purpose felt really contrived.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Montague, Romeo's father. As mentioned by many, his character is so extremely the one dimensional evil villain...and then they try to save his one dimensionality by also cramming in a \"sad\" backstory at the breakneck ending. Except, again, cramming does not a good story make. Definitely does not get his character any sympathy either. \\n\\n\r\nIf these two elements of Montague and the Tree's importance were better integrated, then Romeo x Juliet fantasy could have been much better.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Being a poor judge of art, and very not creative to the max, I can't really say much. But it was smooth enough, and never made me wince about how the characters are drawn(with a few exceptions of Juliet's nose). Much unlike...:cough: Naruto fisheye shots :cough:\\n\\n\r\nSound: Props to Juliet and Romeo's seiyuus, also to Tybalt's, Willy's, and Montague's. Juliet and Romeo's seiyuus felt like they grew into the roles, and seemed to express more emotion, especially when calling the other lover's name, as the series continued. Tybalt=Byakuya nii-sama=win.(total bias, forgive me). Montague's deep/sonorous voice also suited his despotic character. Kazuhiko Inoue as Willy in a flowery voice was also amusing.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, the opening and its sibling english cover of \"You Raise me Up\" was very memorable, as mentioned. Soundtrack, not so much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Minus major points for the random Gardener, and Montague, as mentioned in story. Otherwise, none of the characters really made me go GACK, and I was definitely shocked and sad at the ending of the two lovers. None really stood out either though. Tybalt was shoved to the side for so many episodes! Mercutio also! That is not good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: As I'll tell all my close friends, I'm very much a closet romantic and big sucker for sap. Combine sap with my more boyish love of fantasy, sword fights, save the world and such, and you've got a very very enjoyable anime for me. Again, minus a point simply for how much the Gardener and Montague made me wtf through the middle. \\n\\n\r\nThis is pretty personal though, and most of the population I've met think cliche=cliche=bad, and especially rolled all into a ball like this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8...6 or so? More than 8, but if we remove the wtf, then I'd actually be raving about this anime as one my top favorites. It isn't quite that, sadly.\\n\\n\r\nAgain worth mentioning though, for me, the ending was really beautiful and poignant, and a very good close. It managed to actually make me miss Romeo, who spent most of the story as an unreformed Suzaku-falsely happy, preaching love and peaceful things, and doing a whole lot of nothing.",

            "content": "''Two households both alike in dignity, in fair''....Neo Verona?!?\r\nRomeo X Juliet loosely tells Shakespeare's fateful tale, with heaps of action, romance, politics and fantasy.\r\nStory: \r\nThe story-line is certainly a strong point in this anime, with touching romance and unexpected tragedy. The story is well paced, and quickly grows in momentum. At times, there are some predictable moments and the story simmers down, but there is always something to get it on its feet again. With such an engaging story I expected the conclusion to be a let down, but it ends both beautifully and dramatically. \r\nArt:\r\nThe art is not particularly amazing, but in my personalopinion it is still very good. The characters are not drawn so exaggerated as in many animes, and neither does everyone look the same-which is a welcome change.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound soundtrack played throughout works as a warming addition to the tale-especially in the final episodes, the music plays a rather important part in creating a majestic end. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nOur hero and heroine are both interesting and complex which is a relief! Juliet is not a weak and vulnerable protagonist, but is strong and determined. I love the fact, many characters are not portrayed merely as 'good' or 'evil', everyone has their own past which shapes who they are. There are many characters in this story, due to the sub plots within the anime, and though some are cliche, for the most part they are original and realistic. \\n\\n\r\nHaving just watched the new Hollywood Romeo and Juliet, and now this anime, I must say this tale was a far more captivating one. Though I love the original, this anime gives an interesting and alternative view, but delivering the same spectacular result. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning, Review may contain spoilers!\r\nI really liked this anime. Please realize, however, for those of you who have yet to watch it, the title, I believe, is purely for commercial reasons. Using the title of something so familiar was what first drew me to it, and I am certain that was their intention. Quite clever, really. Apart from the 'star crossed lovers' plot, there is no similarity to the play. When they say it's loosely based on the play, they mean a completely different thread.\r\nThey borrow names from other of Shakespeare's plays, such as Ophelia, and Patrucio (if that's spelled right) But I found nosimilarities to the characters of the 'original' plays.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Romeo leaves the mines with the other workers, it truly shows his competence as a ruler. In the scene where his father dies, there is a very clear contrast in which you see both Romeo's and Montegue's capes; Romeo no longer wears the family crest, meaning he truly gave up his name. In that same scene it is obvious they used the ending of Hamlet; the poisoned sword and all that.\\n\\n\r\nOn a historical note, the besieging of the castle in episode 22 (I think) was reminiscent of the Glorious Revolution, of course in the revolution, the king simply flees to France, but still everyone else surrendered and even welcomed the rebels.\\n\\n\r\nThe end was befitting, and I loved it, but I kept hoping they were still alive 'till the very last minute of the last episode. Perhaps it had been wishful thinking, but I kept seeing hints that they would live--like when they acting out the play in Mantua and Juliet doesn't say the lines assigned to her. Also, how Romeo seemed be almost maturing as a leader. I hated it, really, because it kept you so optimistic and then, they're dead.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don't think there was much character development. It feels as if they remain static. None of them really change through out the series. I think they could have expanded a bit more on some of the supported characters, since we still don't know what was Cordelia's original connection to Juliet. Was she a maid or daughter of a loyal noble? Antonio as well. I didn't even know he was the old man's grandson until the very end. And how about the other two? How did they get involved? The ending left a lot of unanswered questions.\\n\\n\r\nI did like watching it, but in all honesty, I was a bit disappointed with the romance. I didn't quite feel the conflict. Really, what's to keep him from joining rebel forces? I don't know if this is simply me being silly, but when I watch a romance I expect to feel giddy or depressed depending on the even, and I was only touched (not enough for tears though, which I would have hoped for) when they died at the end. Again, I think this is the fault of not enough character development.",

            "content": "Titel: Romeo x Juliet\r\nSorry! It is only German :O\r\nGenres: Romance, Drama, Action, Fantasy, Abenteuer \r\nHandlung: Basiert auf dem Werk von William Shakespeare. Allerdings nur der grobe Konflikt. Das Setting ist stark abge\u00e4ndert, im Fantasy Stil eben. Handelt von dem jungen M\u00e4dchen Juliet, die mit ansehen musste, wie ihre gesamte Familie ermordet wurde. Sie War allerdings erst 2 Jahre alt und kann sich deshalb nicht mehr daran erinnern. Bis zu ihrem 16ten Geburtstag...\r\nCharaktere:\r\nSind nicht unbedingt die besten, da von einigen kaum die Hintergr\u00fcnde vorgestellt werden. Doch bei den meisten wird doch ein wenig beleuchtet. Auch den \"B\u00f6sen\" kann man gegen Ende teilweise verstehen und sich inihn hineinversetzen. Allerdings sind bei ein paar der 'Hauptpersonen' leider Wie schon erw\u00e4hnt die Hintergr\u00fcnde nicht gut bis garniert ausgearbeitet.\\n\\n\r\nMusik: Sehr sch\u00f6n und passend. Ist mir nur an einer Stelle ein wenig negativ aufgefallen, kann aber sonst nur sagen, dass sie die Bilder und Handlungen nahezu perfekt unterstreicht. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation und Zeichenstil:\\n\r\nDie Animationen sind sehr solide bis wundersch\u00f6n. Die wehenden Flaggen in der Stadt sind einfach toll animiert und detailliert gezeichnet. Wobei der Zeichenstil der Personen nicht unbedingt jedermanns Geschmack ist. Ich musste mich erstmal ein wenig daran gew\u00f6hnen, aber finde ihn doch durchaus sch\u00f6n.\\n\\n\r\nPers\u00f6nliches Fazit: Ich habe den Anime als Anime \"zwischendurch\" begonnen, dachte mir: Joa. Kann man ja mal versuchen.... Da ich noch nie wirklich einen Romance Anime gesehen habe. Ich habe ihn \u00fcber Nacht durchgesuchtet, da die Handlung extrem Fesselnd wird, nach den ersten paar Folgen. Man fasst so viel Zuneigung zu den einzelnen Charakteren, wenn man sich auch nur ein wenig Gedanken \u00fcber das, was geschieht macht. Ich pers\u00f6nlich habe auch die ein oder andere Tr\u00e4ne vergie\u00dfen k\u00f6nnen. Aus Freude, Hoffnung oder Leid. Dazu ist der Anime durchaus in der Lage.",

I was blown away.\r\nGoing into this anime i expected it to be predictable, cheesy, generic etc. But no, it was fantastic.\r\nThe story was not at all like the classic romeo and juliet, there are more twists and surprises than even the original. I was never bored and it kept me wanting more. Character development was realistic and not generic as well.\r\nI dont think i have ever teared up as much to any other anime like idid to this one.

I was going to say 'characters'., and yeah, the anime is very dazzling! *Yippee!! study GONZO, you did a great job again!!! So proud of you guys!!>mode: teary-eyedJuliet Fia ... ma-atta?? Fiammatta!! Juliet Fiammatta Ars De Capulet!! **wooh!! thanks Google, I owe you my life!**  what a name. she shouldn't go to a typical school while she bears that name!! oh anyways., Juliet is a great heroine. She's beautiful, bold, graceful and has a very compassionate heart. If I were a guy, she's going to be my ideal girl!! swear!! \\n\\n\r\n>Romeo Candore De Montague-- *while I was typing his name I can't help but smile- like a maniac!*   Romeo Montague is ... hot. hot. hot. a very hot prince!! gosh!! can I be your princess instead?! :PP **the song 'Love Story' is currently playing on the background**\\n\r\nseriously., I adore his gentle personality. I admire his bravery and compassion towards his people in Neo Verona and of course, I love the way he loved Juliet. ~~He was very cute and charming when he first saw Juliet *feminine side* at the Montague's house during a ball. \\n\\n\r\nWell., almost all the characters here are pleasing to the viewers' eyes., *oh yeah, one of the most interesting characters in Romeo x Juliet is William, a comedic char. in many respects. He's obviously a reference to the original author of Romeo and Juliet--the world's pre-eminent dramatist, William Shakespeare. \\n\\n\r\nSince it's a story of Romeo x Juliet., I hope you didn't forget that their story is very unlikely to be a \"happily ever after\" thingy., yes, it's not the same as what happened to Snow White and Sleeping Beauty. \\n\r\nRomeo + Juliet = tragedy. \\n\\n\r\ntuuuuuuuttttt-------spoiler alert!!\\n\\n\r\nI did cry during the last episode!! oh Romeo., why!!! why did you have to die!! then after a while I was like ... OMG Juliet!!! don't sacrifice yourself!! there's still another way!! \\n\r\nThough it was sad., you'd still feel grateful to the both of them., most especially to Juliet., she sacrificed herself for the sake of Neo Verona. **and what the heck!! Neo Verona actually floats!!**",

The first chapters will catch your attention, the middle could be repetitive and a little boring, but the final chapters save in a incredible way the hole history.\r\nIf you're looking for a romance history, I can recommend this one.\r\nStory: Like I said before the final chapters will make you happy to seen this anime. I like that the sequenceof the story will reveal hints that induce to guess the ending. Maybe in the middle you may think \u00bfthis chapters are really necessary? I would said not for the main history, but for characters. Is really original in the develop since I know the original one, and I'm sure you will satisfy with the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt: At the begging I have some doubts if it really gone fit with the characters but as the story progresses it will. The landscapes are really nice, and the main characters outfit suit really well. Some of the character designs appealing don't really convince me until the end, but others fit in the instant you see them. The art is not may I say \"strong\", I mean there not will details in everything but the important thing, It offer a soft atmosphere that follow the love history.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The seiyus personifying very well the characters, and in a love history of course for love scenes will be romantic music. The background music and sounds fit very well, and you should take into account the time that the anime was released for evaluate the quality. The opening is really beautiful and sadly romantic, but since some times the history need to be known as soon as possible, the opening relax the climax. The ending songs suits, second more than the first.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: At the begging I was not totally convinced with the main, since they keep acting in the same way, specially Julieta, excepting a strong and decided woman, not always is like that, but for this is that the other characters exist, to complement her. I really like Tebaldo, is the kind of character that make the history more interesting because is full of mysteries, and sure he is. But in general the develop of each character is well done, it could be more but its just the necessary to understand the history.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Like I said I enjoy watching it but I won't repeat it. Its a great anime that I can recommend If you have free time and want a romance history that will surprise you. Im sure you will enjoy if you see it until the end.",

This is my first time writing a review so I have no idea how well this will go but \"ahuehuehue\" it anyways.\r\nStory (9):\r\nNot really what you expected to happen. At least, if you want to watch it to see how would the anime look like. Honestly, tho I had read the play and I was with the idea \"Oh well, I'm going to be bored\" in my head, I went ahead and watched it. If you think about the show as an interpretation within an interpretation you'd get it somehow why it happened the way it happened.I'll give you a hint: trees. But because it was made this way there are chances that you wouldn't agree/like it, so it's a bit \"dangerous\".\\n\\n\r\nArt (9):\\n\r\nNothing much to say, I pretty liked it. It was bright and the details were well done. Irises flowers and petals were astonishing. There were a bit of weird noses around, but let's not make the end of the world from it. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8):\\n\r\nWhat I can say about the OP? One word - amazing. But sound isn't only about the OP. I really felt sometimes like it was really \"silent\"- just the voice acting. And talking about the voice acting, I felt like the Japanese version was better made. Not quite sure if just my preference to the language, tho English is my second one, or the acting was stronger. Watch an episode dubbed and one subbed and choose. Imo, it really matters in your enjoyment how you find the voice acting. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7):\\n\r\nSome characters do a lot and you don't get much about them, some do a little and you could say more about those. There's no balance. I really expected Juliet and Romeo, at least those to develop more.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9):\\n\r\nYup. As for me I pretty had much fun watching. After a batch of episodes I was always \"going\" to sleep. But, I was finding myself thinking what will happen next, why something happened and \"OMG JULIET YOU DID IT AGAIN GJ GIRL\" or \"OMG....\" oh wait sorry spoilers. Spoilers sweeties. Seriously, I really had fun.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

Although its based on the beautiful play by William Shakespeare \"Romeo and Juliet\", it has a fantasy brush to it. \r\nThe story is more than just Romeo and Juliet, the star crossed lovers, it is its characters and how they evolve and struggle through everything that happens along the story line. But surely it does center greatly on Romeo and Juliet's everlasting love. \r\nThe story is outstanding, and I found myself crying, laughing, and feeling joyful every second of the series. \r\nStory: 10\r\nThe art is the essence of perfection. The beauty of the characters, the breathtaking loveliness ofthe scenarios and backgrounds, the way everything connected was pure magic.\\n\r\nArt:10\\n\r\nThe sound was magnificent. The opening song was brilliantly selected, as well as the two closing songs, which reflect well the core of the anime. Every sound, voice and score were majestically woven together to make the story even more extraordinary. \\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nThe character's are perfection. They are the heart beating strong and loud on this series. The supporting, extra, and antagonist characters are a creation of pure genius. Even more so are the main characters. Romeo and Juliet are more than beautiful, and it's not just because they are Romeo and Juliet themselves but because of the soul and immortal love they share. \\n\r\nCharacter:10\\n\r\nI enjoyed it with all my heart.

I will admit in the beginning this show was a bit slow getting into but as each episode went on, it just got better and better!\r\nThe story is alright, I never saw the original Romeo and Juliet so I can't say how accurate it is to the original story but I still enjoyed it even if I haven't seen the original. I think this is an anime that almost everyone can find something in it. I really like the characters in this version and I think this is the first time I just loved an animesolely because of the characters. These are characters you can react to like Juliet might be my favorite female character in an anime or any media. I really got behind her pacifism and kindness attitude. And then there's my favorite villain in anime Montigue. He's evil but his motivation for being evil is unexpected I just never thought about it.\\n\r\nAs for the art/animation/whatever I think it's okay but it never really wowed me with it's animation. As for the sound I think the music is good but like the animation it never really stood out either however what does stand out is it's excellent English Dub. I know this might sound crazy but I recommend watching the English Dub over Japanese with subtitles.The English dub did something neat and that's adding Ye Olde English to the mix and it's not just a gimmick the delivery of some of the lines are brilliant and adds a lot to the overall experience.\\n\r\nSo yeah it gets 10 from me all around. Except in Art and Sound those get an 8",
