            "content": "This my first time ever writing a review here on MAL. I felt the need to write one because this show is by far the most underrated show of the season. The story is original, the characters are great, and the artwork is beautiful. There is quite a bit of action in Zetsuen no Tempest but it's the dialogue that will keep you on the edge of your seat, especially in the later episodes. It's what happens when there is no real \"bad guy\" and both sides are desperately fighting for what they truly and honestly believe is right. These shows are always so muchmore intense and so much better than your typical \"I'm doing this because I'm evil and you're here to stop me because you're good.\" shows. I highly recommend this show to everyone.",

            "content": "\u201cWhat\u2019s past is prologue.\u201d - The Tempest - William Shakespeare\r\nNothing could say more about Blast of Tempest than Shakespeare\u2019s The Tempest which is heavily referenced throughout the series.  Blast of Tempest is a story about overcoming entrapment in the past, both figuratively and literally.\r\nStory\r\nOne thing that can be said about Blast of Tempest is that it follows a logical premise that manages to feel legitimately inspired despite its fair share of twists.  Even though the story involves magic, the series defines a strong logical framework that both empowers and entraps its characters.\r\nAbove all, our character\u2019s personal history is a major factor in theseries.  It drives Mahiro on a vengeful path to determine who killed his sister and weighs down Yoshino to the point of near-detachment.  It is only when these characters are able to accept fate and focus that they are able to allow a tragic event to become the means to a better end (saving the world).  Moreover, past as a general influence is extremely well-realized.  Events in the past, including Hakaze\u2019s imprisonment, Aika\u2019s death, and even further back to the formation of the Tree of Exodus as a means to end the Tree of Genesis\u2019s purpose in resetting humanity are central to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the notion of order and chaos is thematically prevalent in the series.  Even though the Tree of Genesis represents order, it is only with the chaos represented by the Tree of Exodus that humanity can thrive and even exist.  Despite the resurgence of crime and inequality after the dissolution of the Tree of Genesis, it is easy to understand the necessity in the action and why the order imposed by the Tree of Genesis would eventually deem all of humanity unrighteous.\\n\\n\r\nThe only major flaw to Blast of Tempest\u2018s story is that it tends to use its characters as if they are actors in a play (perhaps intentionally).  Each character plays his part, often without question.  This is extremely noticeable in Aika\u2019s casual acceptance of her fate despite what clearly would have been a difficult decision \u2013 but this may actually speak more to her character than to the show\u2019s tendency to have its actors fill a role.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is very important in Blast of Tempest - and all of its main characters, Hakaze, Yoshino, Mahiro and Aika, are a strong basis to the show\u2019s central themes despite their differing personas.  What enforces their strength is their intelligence \u2013 even in Mahiro\u2019s case \u2013 the characters carefully and cleverly plan their actions.\\n\\n\r\nHakaze is a strong female lead that is open and direct, while sometimes being too upfront and occasionally becoming distracted by desire.  What defines Hakaze the most is that, despite her attunement to the Tree of Genesis, she is far from unquestioning.  Her actions are often fueled by her desire to seek her own path, even with opposition or without knowing the consequences.  It makes her into a character nearly embracing chaos despite the order surrounding her \u2013 which accentuates her foil in Aika.\\n\\n\r\nAika, though appearing frail, is strong to a fault.  Her character embraces the ideology of Exodus far too unconditionally which is but testament to her acceptance with being an actress in a play.  She often quotes Hamlet and The Tempest because she feels that her only goals have already been previously scripted and she must play to those ideals.\\n\\n\r\nMahiro, on the other hand, represents another extreme of chaos with his absolute path of vengeance.  His early ambitions are simply to avenge the death of Aika, but this actually drives him to greatness because of her involvement in much more crucial matters.  When he is freed from this path, his goal has actually become to enact a plan to save the world.  Mahiro is a renegade without being overly reckless and ambitious to a point where he is not clouded.\\n\\n\r\nYoshino, for a large majority of the show, is very detached.  Aika\u2019s death had an opposing effect on him in that he nearly lost desire to function after her passing.  Even though he is tied down by her loss, he thinks clearly and keeps Mahiro in check when he is pushing himself too far.  It\u2019s important to note that Yoshino is the last character to resolve his past as a lesson in history, because he is too entrapped by it.  Hakaze\u2019s confessions to him cause him to break because he is not ready to continue his life until all others\u2019 problems have been resolved.\\n\\n\r\nQuality\\n\\n\r\nBlast of Tempest is breathtaking visually and its usage of classical pieces in its soundtrack is excellently done.  By now, this is what we expect from BONES, so it isn\u2019t too unbelievable that this show lives up to BONES\u2019s capability to generate quality in its production value.  Particularly of note are the show\u2019s excellent action scenes that accentuate brilliant animation along with well-utilized classical music.\\n\\n\r\nClosing\\n\\n\r\nWhile Blast of Tempest occasionally falls short of absolute excellence in its willingness to allow its characters to fill roles, it presents a story of past entanglements that is very well-realized and non-contradictory with a cast that synergizes their differing viewpoints.\\n",

            "content": "Zetsuen no Tempest is an action/supernatural/shonen anime by studio Bones, known for its previous works Eureka Seven, Fullmetal Alchemist, Star Driver, etc. Tempest starts out as a very promising shonen anime with interesting characters and an elaborate setup in a world full of turmoil. Preferring to skip the dramatic buildup, Tempest throws you right into the action and chaos right from the very first episode. Its steady pacing keeps the viewers on the edge of their seat and eager for more of the story. It\u2019s too bad that Tempest doesn\u2019t keep this up for the whole series. Halfway through, the show takes a serious dipin quality in just about every area, aside from maybe animation and sound.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s a shame because Zetsuen no Tempest had so much potential, but it falls flat on its face instead. But let\u2019s talk about the good of this show first. The art and animation are top notch. Studio Bones pulled no punches when it came to the gorgeous animation and character designs. The battles are fast, fluid, and intense, going hand in hand with the spectacular and vivid wheel of colors that enhance the magical effects. The character designs are stylish and unique, with no two characters looking too much alike. Another small little detail that was well done was the character\u2019s clothing. Each character\u2019s various clothing looks like something straight out of a teen fashion magazine; very funky and stylish. Small artistic details are also added in the character\u2019s hair and accessories. If I were rating this anime solely based on its art and animation, it would easily score a nine at the very least. Unfortunately, I did not, and I won\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the not-so-good of Zetsuen no Tempest, which is basically everything else. Perhaps the weakest aspect of the show is its story. The story starts out with Hakaze Kusaribe, the princess of a clan of mages, contacting Fuwa Mahiro to help her extinguish an uprising instigated by her followers. Left stranded on an island by said followers, they can only communicate through magic. Hakaze promises to help Mahiro find his sister\u2019s killer in exchange for his help. Mahiro\u2019s friend, Takigawa Yoshino comes along for the ride, and together the three aim to prevent the Kusaribe clan from awakening the tree of Exodus, which would subsequently bring destruction to the entire world. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire story pays homage to Shakespeare\u2019s works, namely The Tempest and Hamlet. For some reason, the story feels it needs to remind you of this quite frequently, as it seems every few minutes someone is throwing out a Shakespeare quote. There\u2019s no subtlety in its delivery, and the quotes have little meaning to the plot or the characters. It seems they simply threw in several quotes in order to make the script seemed more grand and classy. Instead, it ended up making the entire anime sound incredibly pretentious. It could be argued that the two differing plays were being quoted to signal that this anime could either have a happy or tragic ending, leaving the viewer to wonder in anticipation. But not only is that grasping at straws, it gives the writers more credit than they probably deserve. \\n\\n\r\nNow to be fair, the first half of the series was pretty good. It was standing on shaky ground but it was still quite good. It may have been standard shonen anime fare \u201csave the world with magical powers, stop the bad guys\u201d but it had an interesting enough twist to keep it afloat. The characters were interesting; they had clear cut motivations that at least made some sense. The plot moved about at a comfortable pace with just enough action and character development shimmied into each episode. The rules of the universe made sense. All that was completely ruined by its mess of a second half. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot begins to contradict the rules it established in its first half. It makes no effort to even make sense of Hakaze\u2019s ability to time travel for a second and third time. It presents a ridiculous plot twist that makes even less sense and gives a sort of barbaric edge to Aika\u2019s character that the other characters don\u2019t even bat an eye at. And worst of all, romance is shoehorned in for the sake of throwing in some aspects of a corny school love comedy. Hakaze even alludes to this in a hilarious 4th wall breaking internal monologue.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most disappointing aspects of the show is the degradation of its characters. Yes that\u2019s right, the very characters that made the show go backwards as it drags on. Perhaps the character that does it the most is Hakaze Kusaribe. She is initially presented as a strong heroine, with an arrogant edge that is backed up by her standing as the most powerful mage in the clan. She is cunning and unflinching, yet kind and caring when she needs to be. But of course that is all negated when she falls in love. \\n\\n\r\nYes, LOVE! She becomes clumsy, indecisive, and silly at the first hints of love. Her initial goal was to prevent the destruction of the world and take control of her clan once again. But when she falls in love, she leaves the fate of her clan in the hands of the guy who betrayed her and sent her to an island to die. All so she could travel freely with her love interest. Later, she wants to save the world simply for her love. To say anything else about her silly love driven mindset would mean spoilers, so to be vague, pay attention to what she says when she travels across time a second time. It is so unbelievably silly, bordering on completely idiotic. She goes from a strong heroine to someone whose sole reason for existing and acting is for her love.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe it wouldn\u2019t be that bad it we had some substantial buildup to the relationship, coupled with proof of an established and long-lasting bond that could never be broken. That, and if her feelings were actually reciprocated. Then it would be quite romantic and heroic that Hakaze would do anything for her love. But instead, her actions are based on a silly schoolgirl crush (that quite literally springs out of nowhere) and nothing more, making her actions and motivations seem incredibly idiotic. \\n\\n\r\nFuwa Mahiro and Takigawa Yoshino are perfect foils, making for a very interesting relationship between the two heroes. They get a significant amount of development in the first half of the show through a series of flashbacks, some of which involve Aika. Brash and arrogant Mahiro is the brawn of their duo, while the manipulative and analytical Yoshino is the brains. Their relationship is one of the most interesting ones of the series. How two young men who are so different from each other could end up cooperating so willingly and becoming the best of friends is a real mystery. But their actions in the second half become a bit odd to say the least. Not only that, but they show little emotion when finding out the truth behind Aika\u2019s death, despite the fact that they are the most important people to her. In fact, their lack of emotion is prevalent even in the first half. They are just normal high school boys, not hardened soldiers. Yet their reactions to the destruction of their home certainly don\u2019t give any hints to that. \\n\\n\r\nThen there is Fuwa Aika, one of the most confusing characters. She\u2019s already dead by the beginning of the series, yet still plays an important role in the story. She\u2019s the motivation for Yoshino and Mahiro\u2019s actions and appears in numerous flashbacks. Her character is described in the anime as having a \u201chorrible personality.\u201d That\u2019s not even the half of it. Her development at the tail end of the series hints at a facet of her personality that is far more barbaric, border lining on psychotic. The rest of the side characters are mostly just there for decoration. They are lively personalities to either spice things up or be used as a convenient plot device to move the story along. \\n\\n\r\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, Zetsuen no Tempest is not wholly unwatchable. There is plenty of enjoyment to be had watching this series, especially during the first half. It\u2019s just too bad that Bones screwed up the story and characters so hard during the second half that it irredeemably sours the entire series. The character\u2019s motivations during the second half make little to no sense. And trying to piece together why the characters are doing what they\u2019re doing gives way to the realization that these characters are acting like total idiots. The plot twist during the second half was also ridiculous, giving the viewer little justification for WHY things had to be this way. Not to mention the implausibility of the situation based purely on the rules set by the anime. \\n\\n\r\nZetsuen no Tempest is a great watch if you turn off your brain and just enjoy it for what it is: Your \u201conly very slightly above average until the second half of the show\u201d shonen anime. Anybody looking for anything more won\u2019t get much enjoyment out of this anime.  \\n",

            "content": "How should I say this... This anime was one of the best that I've seen. Whenever I have nothing to watch, I would turn to Zetsuen no Tempest (Blast of the Tempest/ The Civilization Blaster). The ending was perfect, the story line was amazing, but the best of all were the characters.\r\nLet me go into detail...\r\nStory: The story was put together in a great yet questionable way. There were many parts of the anime that could be related to the famous works of Shakespeare. With plot twists that would leave you confused, the story was never boring. The twisted tale of love, hate, revenge anda touch of magic was most definitely satisfying especially how the ending wrapped up the entire story. I sincerely wish that they would make a sequel.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was satisfying, it clearly showed details in the magic shields and barriers. They point that stood out the most for me were the eyes. The characters eyes showed their emotions so clearly that they sent shivers down my spine, how they would dull or brighten depending on the emotions being conveyed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music chosen for this anime was.... Fabulous. The violin solos with the varying volumes matched the pace of the show and the suspense in the best fashion. The opening and endings weren't boring and they definitely didn't reveal a lot about the story. The upbeat openings shows the action and the more aggressive emotions in the show whereas the slower themes in the endings portrays the more negative and deeper feelings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Gosh, all of the characters were so perfect. They each played a huge role in the story but I think I should be more specific. Takigawa Yoshino is my favorite character, he is so mysterious and he definitely is a major character. He is referred as Horatio in some parts of the anime. His tale of not being able to grieve for the one he loves is heart breaking, how he shows great deduction skills and how he seems so innocent is so twisted and yet it fits the story perfectly. Fuwa Mahiro is the rich and feared character. His feelings played a large role, I find his motives very amusing throughout the plot. Yoshino and Mahiro are very... different characters compared to the cliches that show up nowadays. When you expect them to do something, they do the complete opposite. But what scares and surprises me the most is the lack of response from the two of them, no matter what they can always appear calm. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I ranked this anime a 9/10. Although I would say that it's closer to a 9.5/10. XD\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review, so I hope I did well...",

            "content": "Some secrets are better left dead.\r\nYet, in some ways, they always seem to come back from the past and continue to be part of your lives. It's like when you go through a photo album and you see that one picture which strikes you the most. You take out that picture and examines it carefully and take a trip down memory lane. However, in this series, that memory lane isn't a happy memory. No, in fact, it's one ride you wish you'd never had taken because from that event, things are never the same again.\r\nZetsuen no Tempest (also known as Blast of Tempest) is ananime series adapted from the manga of the same name handled by Bones. The studio is already known for some of their other works with the supernatural/super power themes such as Full Metal Alchemist, Darker than Black, and Star Driver. Their latest title in their line of evolution of works is this little gem. Written by Kyou Shirodaira, the series follows the aftermath involving  lives of two best friends after the events of a tragic past. To uncover the mysteries of the past, they seek the help of a powerful magician and with their help might find the answer they are looking for. At the same time, it's up to the duo to stop a mysterious clan on the horizon to prevent the end of the world. \\n\\n\r\nSounds all intriguing and mind bobbling right? Well, that's what it seems at first especially with the rather confusing pilot episode...\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, there are many questions that seems to need answers not only revolving for the main protagonists but for ourselves as well. It's no surprise there is so much mystery involved either considering the author of the series is also involved in another mystery title, Spiral: The Bonds of Reasoning. The pilot episode suggests this with introduction of the main characters and a small glimpse of their mysterious past. Curiously enough, we also see the \u201cmage in the barrel\u201d (as the pilot episode suggests) that may make us scratch our heads a bit more. In fact, we can even see blood and tragedy already from the backgrounds. Furthermore, there seems to be a barrage of butterflies roaming in the air as well as the monotonic speeches from the main protagonists. To add to the package, we have some action including a dark haired beauty, shounen-style action gags, and a seemingly civilization that is in ruins for God-knows-what reasons with a touch of magic. All sound mind bobbling, doesn't it? For some reason, it's how the series begin and towards the ends it shows the dark revelation of a tragedy. In order to embrace on what's to come, it's imperative to watch the series with some insight and with your brains focused on more than just the pretty visuals.\\n\\n\r\nOh but visuals itself doesn't just represent Zetusen no Tempest. It's a bit more than that. For fans of Shakespeare, this could be a delight of those into his literature. As a matter of fact, a few of the dialogues and characters may represent his works themselves. For example, the term \u201cTempest\u201d could be a homage of Shakespeare's work of \u201cThe Tempest\u201d, which was assumed to be one of his last creations. The themes from that play such as an island setting, magic, and those bits of romance suggests this and be converted into modern times. It's quite appealing to watch though as most of us who attends those boring English classes at high school and sleeping through discussions (you know who you are) might get a pleasant surprise at this series. If not, well then, tough break.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of the series seems to be quite attractive not only with the mysterious backgrounds but also the way it is presented. The Tree of Exodus seems to play a prominent role to determine the fate of the world by the way everyone tries to learn and awaken its power. It can also be implied that the Tree of Exodus may be a key to unlock the main protagonists' past tragedies and the truth they are looking for. Nevertheless, it is definitely important since everyone wishes to get to it before the others. The mysteries surrounding the plot seems also revolve around the purpose and true origins of that tree. Why was it there? What is its power? And how did it came to be are just a few of many questions that the viewers may ask themselves when progressing through this series. There also seems cases of government conspiracies and conflicts between clans with its fellow mages. All of this spells out the word confusion (it sure did for me!) in the first half of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also various flashbacks played throughout the series from the viewpoint of Mahiro related to the case of a main character. She is in fact already dead prior to the series but maintains a strong after-presence with her backgrounds and the mysteries that resulted her death. Plus, there is peach haired princess Hakaze who is crafty, resourceful, and often likes to play mini mind games with the antagonist, and at times with Mahiro and Yoshino. Bored much? Well, probably from being stranded on that island for an extended period of time. In fact, she has her own little secret that gets revealed soon and that itself is a mystery. Nonetheless, the plot twists and various sequences are crafted carefully in order to not go off track and often makes viewers question themselves on what's next. That's where the thriller part comes in. It is thrilling with some of the surprises but at other times, just cliched or even predictable. However, it should be no surprise that Mahiro clearly wants revenge expressed by the look of his face each time his past is reminded. He wants vengeance for his tragic past and he'll stop at nothing to achieve it. Mahiro desire for revenge spells out his determination and what he wants. Yet, there's a point to be said here. Even if he achieves his goal of revenge, the past won't change. The dead don't just get back and walk again.\\n\\n\r\nThe series maintains a small cast of characters rather than a whole all-star ensemble. The two main male protagonists, Mahiro and Yoshino seems to resemble a reflection of William Shakespeare's famous works, Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet respectively. If we look at it carefully, Mahiro seeks revenge for his tragic past similar to Prince Halmet from the play. Mahiro struggles to avenge the death of his family while at times becomes irrational in the way of him doing things. On the other hand, there's Yoshino who seems to allude the character Romeo. In Shakespeare's famous play, Romeo and Juliet, Romeo loses someone they hold dear to their heart. The result of that loss becomes a tragedy in what seems to be a forbidden love story from his work. Behind the scenes of all this drama is the girl Aika who despite her lack of a physical  presence in the series seems to influence it more than anything. Although she doesn't technically make a physical appearance in the show in its present storyline, viewers can clearly see that she is a special individual to both the main protagonists. As a matter of fact, even Hakaze is curious about her (despite not seemingly know who she is) after being acquainted with the main protagonists. From my viewpoint, Aika seems to represent a girl with a mysterious personality with a manipulative state of mind. \\n\\n\r\nThe antagonist of the series, Samon also has a mysterious way of doing his things. In particular, he seeks out the Tree of Exodus with his clan but at the same time seems to want to prevent the destruction of the world with his own ideologies. Behind that suit also seems to lie an insecure individual even with the protection of one of the most elite of those mages from the series. \\n\\n\r\nAs being action, fantasy, and shounen all at once, expect some action throughout the series. The way is presented is in a magical way that although lacks strategy focuses more on morality even doing the occasional dialogues between the fight scenes. However, this doesn't last too long. The fight scenes are significantly toned down later on and hell, even eradicated later on from the show. It goes from action packed to lengthy dialogue that almost seems like reading a textbook. The certain shift of sequences from saving the world to speeches toned me off a bit especially when one moment, there seems to be cool action with an apocalyptic presentation. Then, the next moment it shifts to long dragged out speeches about morality, identity, and more mysteries. The speeches themselves seems to be a bit confusing and not surprisingly enough has Mahiro voice his desire to take revenge AGAIN. The way the characters speak in some of the later dialogues also seems repetitive and digs a bigger hole to the mystery itself with more and more bizarre revelations. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of artwork, Zetsuen no Tempest has a well crafted image of portraying its various scenes. The art directors makes most of the visuals appealing that gets to the point with the themes of the series. In fact, most of the palates and crafted visuals represents the civilization, the tragic scenes, flashbacks, paradise, etc. The characters' designs are also visually represented well especially Aika who has a sense of beauty in her manipulative ways. The series even attempts some jokes with its visuals such as the snickers bar. There some bits of fan service mainly involving around Hakaze by the way she dresses on the island during wet days. But it's really not too much in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the series has many Shakespearean like rhythm to them. It should not be a surprise though given the themes of the series. Kazuhiro Wakabayashi (Soul Eater, Wolf's Rain, xxxHolic) orchestrates many of the music scores well and develop that sense of mysterious atmosphere in many episodes. In fact, the eerie soundtrack and factors with the dialogues matches well with the rhythms. The opening song, \"Spirit Inspiration\" by Nothing's Carved In Stone from the first half has a strong representation in the sense of what the series may be potential be about. All the main characters as well as some of the supporting characters are presented along with potential conflicts. The first ED song, \u201chappy endings\" is presented by Kana Hanazawa who does quite a nice job with her voice. The song shows many of the more metamorphic images involving the main characters as well as the butterflies as seen throughout many times in the series. She also happens to voice one of the main characters in the series, Aika. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Zetsuen no Tempest represents a modern style mystery with some ancestry blood of William Shakespearean work bought to life. The life of one of the main characters no longer exists and that set off many of the conflicts. The conflicts from this series are quite a twist with the various plot holes and surprises. It can be thrilling even with the dialogues but at times, it can also be a bit bothersome. It's a mysterious series to me and should be considered a watch.",

            "content": "Zetsuen no tempest was one of the anime that had me waiting for each episode. A series I'd probably have seen all together if I hadn't been watching it as it was being aired. And so, this review is after seeing 7 episodes of the series. I might update it if I feel the need to, but as for now, this is my opinion of the series.\r\n----STORY----\r\n\"Yoshino, Why did Aika have to die this way? It's been ten months and they don't have any leads. Nothing left behind.. no witnesses.. They don't even know if the killer was acting alone. The task force hardly doesanything anymore. It's absurd. It makes no sense...\"\\n\r\n\"Then, what will you do about this absurdity? Find her killer and punish them yourself?\"\\n\r\n\"Yeah, that's it... I'll do whatever it takes to have everything make sense again!\"\\n\\n\r\nFollowing his sister's mysterious murder, Fuwa Mahiro sets out to find her killer and avenge her death. Then three years later, he returns to his hometown and chances upon his childhood friend Takigawa Yoshino, who doesn't know what to think when his best friend uses magic to save his life, and starts talking about mages, an ancient magic clan, the princess stranded on a distant island  and a strange phenomenon that can destroy the world. And yet, Yoshina can't help but believe what he's being told.\\n\r\nThe story of this anime is the kind that tends to keep the viewers in the dark. The facts are clearly explained. The magic system is not very complicated, but doesn't seem to be created halfway through either. But it's difficult to understand the characters' intentions. They do become a little clearer as their pasts are revealed. But they're mostly unpredictable. The random Shakespearen quotes add a tinge of drama which goes very well with the story, and they don't feel out of place. I'm not a huge fan of Shakespeare but I do feel like reading a little more of his stuff after watching it.\\n\r\nAnd so, I'll give the story an 8. Not extraordinary, but done quite well. The anime seems to focus more on the characters.\\n\\n\r\n----CHARACTERS----\\n\r\nEven though most of the main characters were introduced very early in the show(the first episode, actually), there is very little known about them. There is a lot of mystery about both Mahiro and Yoshino's relation with Aika(the girl who was murdered), and they both themselves don't really come off as 'friends'. Still, they come to the other's rescue when it matters and seem to get along well, despite their conflicting personalities.\\n\r\nBut the most striking thing is Mahiro and Yoshino both are not the kind of guys you'd imagine saving the world. Being ex-delinquents, they do have some experience with fights, but a one-minded revenge crazed guy and an easy going person who seems okay with everything wouldn't be my choice. In contrast to most protagonists, Yoshino actually enjoys being the hero, and the thought of saving the world he hates, which is quite refreshing. Then there's Aika herself. The little that is revealed about her from the flashbacks did make it clear that she was a woman that knew what she wanted, and didn't let anyone else in on it.\\n\r\nAll in all, it's very engaging knowing more about the characters. 9/10\\n\\n\r\n----ANIMATION AND MUSIC----\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty decent. The fighting scenes and magic effects are nicely done. The expressions also come off well. The present feels vivid but the flashbacks have a distant feel to them. It's easy to immediateley differentiate them(the fact that the flashbacks have Aika aside). And the quality of the animation is the same for all episodes. The music is good and suits the show. And I don't see myself skipping the opening or ending song anytime soon. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: I'm enjoying the anime a lot. The story is neither too fast paced, nor too slow. The show has a lot to offer, so it's definitely worth a shot. It has a dramatic feel to it, but that is also not overdone. The first episode pretty much reflects the style of the entire anime. And it only gets better from there on.",

            "content": "The following review is essentially a salty rambling involving a show no one's watched and a particularly egregious cinema sin: \"quote dropping\".\r\nNothing grinds my gears more than a highly superficial anime that pretentiously throws around Shakespeare quotes with no apparent purpose or meaning. No, it doesn't emphasize the show's dramatic storytelling, nor does it contribute to the themes (or lack thereof) that the show attempts to present. Rather, shows that arbitrarily drop quotes from popular novelists, psychologists, or philosophers (e.g. Psycho-Pass and Perfect Insider) for no other reason than to feign intelligence are simply insulting.\r\nZetsuen no Tempest, a 2012 anime purportedly inspired by Shakespeare's dramas,bases its characters and plot on plays such as The Tempest, Romeo and Juliet, and Hamlet. However, if you take away the frivolous and out-of-context quote dropping, you wouldn't recognize the resemblance. Strip away the superficial \"homage\" entirely and you're left with a trope-heavy and mediocre \"save the world\" plot with some far-fetched fantasy elements.\\n\\n\r\nBear with me for a while as I try to make sense of Zetsuen no Tempest's cluster**** of a plot. It's spoiler-free, and one of the most contrived scenarios I've ever seen in a shonen title.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPlot\\n\\n\r\nFrom what I gather, there's a group of magi attempting to bring about the end of the world through a pandemic that turns everything to metal. In order to do so, they're summoning a giant tree that causes \"fruit\", or giant eye-ball covered things attached to chains, to bear from the ground. These mages have exiled their leader, Hakaze, an omnipotent teenage girl with a God-like command of magic, on a desert island. She was opposed to the group's actions, but one has to beg the question\u2026 How did they manage to capture and imprison their leader if she's shown, on multiple occasions, to overpower them? Hell if I know! In any case, she's somehow managed to establish contact with the outside world, bestowing her powers in talismans that she's spread around Japan. Wait\u2026 If she was able to do this, doesn't that mean she foresaw the betrayal? Isn't there a more effective method of seeking help than throwing magical walkie-talkies across a country? Again, the show doesn't really explain these conveniences. They're plot holes, but extremely contrived ones at that.\\n\\n\r\nBut wait! That's not all of it\u2026 The main plot actually revolves around the mysterious death of the protagonist's sister. The viewer follows our two teenage heroes, Yoshino and Mahiro, as they unravel this conspiracy, while the hectic apocalyptic background attempts to brings it all together. Thankfully, the show isn't as hard to follow as I've made it sound. If anything, the slow build-ups and incessant, heavy-handed expositions make the plot seem completely arbitrary in nature. Moreover, the setting is centered around a post-apocalyptic event, but the way Zetsuen no Tempest mishandles and neglects its impact makes everything seem inconsequential. Half of Japan was wiped out by a magical, unknown epidemic and the parents of the main protagonist were in a city known to be affected by said epidemic? Well, we'll just show a single, 10 second scene of the destruction and be done with it. The action falls under a similar pattern, with the majority of confrontations being entirely mindless and serving no purpose. For example, an entire episode was spent showing the fight between some random henchman with a spear and the main protagonist - almost 20 minutes of senseless fighting without any sort of context. At least the audience can find humour in the fact that the main protagonists constantly used teleportation to fight, but when overpowered, the fight simply ends with the protagonists running away... On foot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the biggest plot hole was the \"Romeo and Juliet\" forbidden romance between Yoshina and Mahiro's sister, Aika. Love at first sight is a rather aggravating occurrence that plagues all of Shakespeare's romantic tragedies, and like many Shakespearean plays, the coupling of Aika and Yoshino was mostly born out of convenience. Despite being Yoshino's motivation for joining the quest to save the world, his entire relationship with Aika and their attraction was largely unexplained. It's understandably difficult to establish or depict a relationship with a dead character, but there really needs to be some substance behind the character's death and their relationship with the living cast if the entire plot is be grounded by it. If the viewer isn't given any reason to care about the show's central characters, why should we give a damn about a conflict that's propelled by them?\\n\\n\r\nOne of the few redeeming aspects of the show was the fact that its protagonists had unclear motivations for \"playing the hero\". Their relationship with each other isn't really expanded beyond \"childhood friends, one delinquent and his well-reasoned buddy that tries to set him straight\". However, it's interesting to speculate as to why they're trying to save the world (beyond the obvious justification of their inevitable destruction). Neither protagonist, Yoshino or Mahiro, seems to have a particular attachment to the world they're trying to save, but they can't be accurately characterized as \"nihilistic\". Every aspect about the characters beyond this feature, however, was largely uninspired. Mahiro's characterization is as flat as revenged-crazed siblings come, but Yoshino was particularly disappointing in that he's introduced and constantly remarked as a sly, manipulative person. Despite all of this exposition, he never appears to be anything more than a well-intentioned, level-headed character for more or less the entirety of the series. Zetsuen no Tempest is a frustrating case where the show continuously tells the viewers about its characters rather than building characterization through the plot and context. In fact, almost all of the character traits revealed throughout the show were given through observations by other characters - Hakaze is revealed to be powerful only through the praise of her followers, Yoshino is supposedly manipulative because Aika introduced him as such, and Mahiro's brashness comes from all of the characters frequently calling him out on it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is passable, but not spectacular by any means. Zetsuen no Tempest does get kudos, however, for a successful depiction of post-apocalyptic environments. The colour palettes were dark and earthy, with most of its settings lying somewhere on the grey scale. Similar to the manga, the pseudo-bishonen/bishoujo design is somewhat hit-or-miss and prevalent on each and every character. Every male character has an overly exaggerated hair style and colour, but it isn't overly bothersome. What is bothersome, however, is the repeated use of certain scenes. Practically every episode reminds viewers of the overarching \"ritual\" plot by showing the same scene of robed, chanting figures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nIn the sound department, Zetsuen no Tempest mostly relies on dramatic, classical pieces. Befitting, but hardly memorable.The first OP stands out though, being an English rock song sung by an entirely Japanese band. If there's one thing about the show that I can wholeheartedly recommend, it'd be the music of Nothing's Carved in Stone's.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nI can't really recommend this show to anyone, despite the fact that it's being praised as one of the best mystery/thrillers to recently air. Hell, I could hardly find any reason to finish this show myself. If you're looking for something thoughtful, then I highly suggest you give this show a pass. There really isn't any \"heavy-dialogue\" in a good sense, except the frequent info dumps that result from a really contrived (and ultimately unsuccessful) plot. All in all, Zetsuen no Tempest is a highly mediocre shonen title, with enough inconsistencies and missteps to make any informed viewer scratch their head with frustration.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hey there\r\nSo this is my first review of any anime but I wrote reviews about manga before. Anyways, don't be harsh xD\r\nThe first thing that caught my attention for this anime was how its wallpaper looked like. It was just an advertisement when I was watching some other anime, and I was like..hmm, this looks interesting. I didn't have the slightest clue about what it is, neither that it was a new anime or its genres. I just decided to watch it cause I was bored and the genres were my favorites. So I watched the first episode and it did not disappoint me. Wellto be honest I didn't like it that much when it began. It made absolutely no sense to me. There was just some random things happening that had no connections to each other and it didn't make sense at all. But at the end, they all connected to each other and you wanna know more and what's gonna happen next. Things that made no sense alone, now make sense with each other. I only watched the first three episodes that's already out, but the story seems promising and it's gonna be on my list to follow up.\\n\r\nAlthough there's a bad point to it, that it's not that unique. As I was watching the anime a lot of other anime came across my mind. But oh well, you can't always expect a perfect anime :D\\n\r\n>Story: 9\\n\\n\r\nI can't say there's anything special about the art except for the actions scenes. The characters are normal anime characters that you see in any other anime. I would say they really look alike the characters from durarara and Guilty Crown. Still it is good art. The actions scenes are kinda unique though. Well I never saw any kind of this action in any other anime before, so I guess that's what makes it unique. Unlike many other action anime, in this anime the action scenes are really good animated and it did not disappoint me.\\n\r\n>Art: 8\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the sound. The voice actors do a really good job and can express the feelings well. The background sound is good as well and it puts you in the mood of the anime, you can actually feel mystery, sadness, anger and all the other emotions through the sound. \\n\r\n>Sound: 9\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked the most about this anime is the characters. The characters really attracted me and I wanna know more about them. There's a lot of mystery hidden behind the personality of each character and you think you just see through them in the first glance, but you're wrong cause you don't. How the characters developed in the past few episodes was really good. I'm looking forward to each of their character development.\\n\r\n>Characters: 10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the anime overall. As I said before I only watched it cause I was bored but now I'm hooked. I really want the new episodes to come out. How everything mixes together makes this anime outstanding. \\n\r\n>Enjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of action, mystery and magic, you have to watch this. It's not just silly anime and it has a serious feeling to it. I really liked it so far and hopefully it'll stay this way.\\n\r\nHope this helps. ^__^",

            "content": "This is a story that constantly quotes and references Hamlet and The Tempest, both works of Shakespeare. Some people will love that fact, while others may be a little annoyed. I thought it was done very well, and I really loved the theme and the execution of this series. I have not read the Manga it is based on, but I never expected to love this series going into it. I was pleasantly surprised and it's now one of my favorites. It is a great blend of story, dialogue, action, and it has a great visual and audio presentation.\r\nWhat's it about? The synopsis doesn't reallysay. It's about magic, it's about relationships, it's about the end of the world, and it's about quirky characters that interact with each other in very bizarre ways. It's difficult to describe without throwing spoilers around. Think \"Shakespeare Play\" and you'll get the feel of it right away!\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those beautifully done series as far as artwork and animation goes. It's consistent, it's good quality and it has some wow moments. The music fits well, and it enhances the experience, and the voice acting is done very well. Being filled with so much dialogue, this is an important piece for them to nail and I think they did just that. I loved the package, I loved the execution, and I really think it shines in these elements.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Zetsuen no Tempest were dysfunctional, unexpected, and yet wonderful at the same time. The two main characters were not your stereotypical heroes, in fact their roles in this story were borderline bizarre. This story is based on the emotional involvement of these main characters. They do have their awesome moments early on, but later in the story are not the dominant \"action heroes\" of the tale by any means. The fate of the world revolves around the \"feelings\" of all parties involved, and the two main characters relationship with each other keep the fate of mankind hanging in the balance. It is a character driven story, and the characters are not swarming with stereotypes. I loved that fact about Zetsuen no Tempest, and I think it gives it that little extra something.\\n\\n\r\nNow the story.... I loved the story, though it's filled with plot holes and flawed logic. The flawed logic is going to really bother some people, but the constant reference to the flawed logic of \u201cthe world\u201d really almost pokes fun at the story in general. It\u2019s a little ridiculous while being absolutely wonderful at the same time. The fact is that the flaws are used as storytelling devices, and it's the plot holes and flaws that help tell the story properly. It is a little obvious at times, but it has some nice little twists and surprises that keep it fresh. Best of all it\u2019s told in such a way that it was easy to watch week to week. I looked forward to every episode and the cliffhangers were done very well.\\n\\n\r\nI really loved this series. It was different enough to feel fresh while being absurd and intriguing at the same time. I loved the main characters and I loved how it tried to imitate Shakespeare in its delivery. The fast and quirky dialogue while focusing on the interpersonal relationships made this series special. I highly recommend it!\\n",

A strange concept it is indeed, and this anime is, without a doubt, one of the most pretentious I have seen as a result. I admire the writer for being self-absorbed enough to take two classic pieces of literature, and squeeze them into the context of ahigh-schooler mystery action anime. Surprisingly though, it is exactly this confidence that the show exudes that makes the mixture click beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nOur main characters, Fuwa Mahiro and Takigawa Yoshino, are thrust almost immediately into a world where everyone is turning into stone, Mahiro\u2019s found a doll allowing him to speak to Kusaribe Hakaze (a half-naked magician/tsundere stuck on an island) with Yoshino just following along looking generally photogenic. Standard fare then, for a shounen series. The real standout feature for the series presents itself rather abruptly with the fixation on referencing Shakespeare, particularly when Fuwa Aika (Mahiro\u2019s recently murdered sister) enters the stage. The story and characters aren\u2019t just inspired by Shakespeare, they\u2019re going to make sure you know the sole reason they have for their existence is to be going around quoting Shakespeare. \\n\\n\r\nSo it is unsurprising, given the plays this anime is inspired by, that this is a tale of revenge primarily for both the main characters. For Mahiro, it is a chance to use his newfound magic capabilities thanks to Hakaze in order to track down his sister\u2019s killer (for whom he has a very obvious, entirely unrequited, love). Yoshino meanwhile is determined to gain peace of mind for the death of Aika, who until her death was secretly dating Yoshino under her brother\u2019s nose. Yoshino tries to make it seem that he tags along however so as not to see the killer punished by Mahiro, to uphold his position as our inevitable token idealistic anime character (in the very best of ways though). \\n\\n\r\nAnyone familiar with the stories of The Tempest or Hamlet will quickly notice the similarities between Blast of Tempest\u2019s two main characters and the protagonists of The Tempest and Hamlet. Mahiro in his hell-bent devotion to revenge, calls Hamlet to mind, whereas in his more optimistic but rational moments, Yoshino is a transparent reference to The Tempest\u2019s Prospero. While not necessary, as the anime does a reasonable job of explaining to the audience the overall themes behind The Tempest and Hamlet, anyone with even a passing knowledge of the stories and in particular the characters of both these Shakespeare plays will no doubt leaving the anime more satisfied. The ties to Shakespeare the story and characters the anime holds become more and more elegant as it progresses, and are certainly one of the most enjoyable features of the anime. That is, if you can handle the sacrilege that is an anime so arrogantly ripping of the works of the one true playwright (note: sarcasm)\\n\\n\r\nSecondary characters in the show are largely passable, especially after the change in personality much of the characters have in the second half of the anime, which adopts a far more shounen tone than its first half. What you make of this is very much dependent on your overall opinion of typical shounen anime. If anyone had to animate this show though, I am glad it was studio Bones; the light-dark tones of the second half of Tempest are reminiscent of the comedy tones Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood had going for it when it wasn\u2019t being a horribly dark I see you\u2019ve just turned that poor girl into a monster you heartless bastards sort of show. \\n\\n\r\nBlast of Tempest\u2019s animation is what I would expect coming from Bones, not up there but definitely pleasant to the eye. I think Bones knew however that they wouldn\u2019t need exquisitely animated backgrounds, because it surely isn\u2019t just me who can\u2019t get over those character designs? The power of photogenicity is definitely strong in these ones. And respect to Bones for making a show where some of the characters do occasionally find themselves wearing different clothing. If you\u2019re not a fan of shounen ai, stay very much clear \u2013 this show is like the gateway drug to watching Free! - Iwatobi Swim Club.\\n\\n\r\nThe music as well ranks very highly for this show \u2013 particular props to Fuwa Aika\u2019s seiyuu, Hanazawa Kana (also known for Kuroneko in OreImo and Mayuri in Steins;Gate), who apart from playing the ultimate ice queen as Aika, can lay claim to one of the more pleasant ending songs I have listened to. Spirit Inspiration, the first op, is great fun as well, if utterly, entirely devoid of actual meaning. Wholly deserving of my best use of engrish 2013 award.\\n\\n\r\nBones no doubt took a bit of a gamble with this show \u2013 the story is so far up its own behind it probably put many people off without giving it time to settle down and, worse still, it isn\u2019t set in a high school. I am so glad however that they did. This 25 episode anime has an incredibly satisfying sense of progression, taking time to slow itself down before each crescendo, with the first half in particular being one of my favourite arcs in anime. If logic and rational progression in a shounen story aren\u2019t your thing, you will probably leave Blast of Tempest feeling underwhelmed, as my favourite episodes of the series, episodes 9-12, are spent almost entirely stationary by the main characters, engaging in a good old fashioned debate. However, if you appreciate more logical progression in a storyline with a good sense of pacing, and less fanservice-based, more intelligently designed characters, you should definitely give Blast of Tempest a look. If the entire concept sounds mad but cool to you, that\u2019s exactly what it is, and it\u2019s brilliant for it.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation: Psycho Pass for a similarly pretentious and yet oddly satisfying storyline, filled with photogenic characters galore (and a penchant for quoting various well-known authors). Funnily enough, the band responsible for Tempest\u2019s first op also has a (rather good) op in Psycho Pass. Note that Psycho Pass is a work of Gen Urobuchi, so by definition almost is darker than FMA and Blast of Tempest combined, with room to spare for a Madoka Magica sequel. \\n",

            "content": "There's this common expression: \"all bark and no bite.\" Blast of Tempest is a dog that barks Shakespeare quotes aimlessly, holding little weight and consequence out of the context of its wholesome product. It's like how there's so much Zelda paraphernalia that gradually obfuscates from the point of what the iconic series was in the first place - a large game franchise with a grand mythos of diverse interconnecting core stories and subplots. Blast of Tempest puts up a facade of intelligence and substance by spouting Shakespeare when there's hardly any actual story content to speak of it. Well then, I'll move on to thecore of the review that I have something to talk about, unlike this very series itself.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Okay, let's start this on a positive note before I start slamming this series for its lack-of-\"Story\"; the initial episodes have promise at least. We have the Romeo expy Yoshino standing at his girlfriend's grave when a mysterious woman by the name of Evangeline appears asking about the whereabouts of his old friend Mahiro, the Hamlet expy. Mahiro encounters Evangeline and things get hectic. It turns out Mahiro has connections to this missing woman named Hakaze who is a mage trapped on some far off island and she wants to stop her brother Samon from reviving a magical tree that threatens the planet. Mahiro fends off Evangeline with the various magical talismans Hakaze left across the area. Meanwhile giant seeds of the Tree of Exodus Samon is trying to revive are sprouting over the city and petrifying anyone who isn't protected by a talisman. Evangeline suspects it's Hakaze's doing because Mahiro is seen actively using Hakaze's magic himself. Mahiro communicates with Hakaze via this magic idol, and Mahiro is assisting Hakaze on the condition that she finds his sister's murderer, and unbeknownst to Mahiro, his dead sister was Yoshino's girlfriend in secret. Some of Samon's assistants are thrown into the conflict to ensure things go smoothly with Exodus' resurrection, and Yoshino teams up with Mahiro to get him out of the bind and to also find out who killed his lover Aika. The first 3 episodes have lots of action and intrigue, with various sides clashing, a catastrophic plan unfolding and a decent dose of angst...but then it doesn't know where to go from there, almost literally I might add. Mahiro and Yoshino travel around every 2 episodes or so, but since nothing's going on in the present, they just settle in one spot shortly after and show flashbacks of Yoshino, Mahiro and Aika and then one boring fight scene in an aquarium and Yoshino being captured for a short period thrown to mix it up a bit. Once episode 8 comes, things get even thinner; we have not one, not two, but FOUR episodes of a long winded sophistry battle between Yoshino, Mahiro and Samon trying to prove Hakaze still being alive (which was earlier suspected to be all a weird contradiction) involving duplicates, time rifts and other stuff, and the arguments go back and forth with neither party having much evidence or going to much length to argue their stance while the government tries to attack the Tree of Exodus. When the half point hits, the world is stricken by calamity, but there's no driving conflict or urgency in the second cour, so the characters--which, mind you, all villains reconcile with the allies at this point--just meander around and occasionally blow up a tree or two every now and then, because again, nothing is going on. After blowing up enough trees (yeah, take that environment!), the plot starts to head towards some semblance of a conclusion, but not before we find out who Aika's killer is, which happens to be one of the most ludicrous and groan-worthy twists I've ever seen, and it's all uncovered thanks to the magic of a crappy time travel element to put the crap icing on the garbage cake. The remaining events unfold without many bumps in the road, wrapping up in a totally run of the mill happy ending just to nip it in the bud. That's pretty much it. The story is about as thin as a nickel and is littered with many problems, but it has the occasional saving grace like the first 3 episodes, the conflict with society and the media on blowing up the trees fearing worse than the already poor conditions, and a delightfully liberating and refreshing scene where the one sane and logical side character beats the crap out of our far gone angst-ridden protagonists. That's all more than enough to save it from being one of the worst things ever, but it is still a big waste of time. I love Shirodaira's most prolific work, Spiral, so I had some expectations going in, and suffice to say I was massively disappointed, such a shame.\\n\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Oh goody, the characters. I'll be fair and say that for the most part they started off tolerable in the first cour before the even more dreadful second, but there's still nothing exemplary from most of them, and the second cour does some hefty damage to them. Yoshino is the lovelorn Romeo character who goes from being more proactive and level headed to whiney and self-loathing, Mahiro is the cynical and sharp-tongued Hamlet who goes from a driven avenger to an egotistical bully and Aika is the sadistic princess who played around with both of them. Hakaze turns from a confident and spunky lass to a nagging waifu trying to pine for Yoshino. Evangeline is something of an aggressive Misato-esque warrior woman who stays fairly consistent but is less prominent in the latter half while her assistant Takumi is pretty much just along for the ride. Hakaze's big bro Samon gets some of the worst of it, turning from a stern and headstrong antagonist to...comic relief with a straight face. His right hand brawn, Natsumura, is a ruthless stoic, but he doesn't have much of a hand in the second half, but Tetsuma the brains and voice for Samon has it worse, becoming nothing more than a cab driver for everyone else. Now, the one who is straight up the worst character of the lot the entire time...Junichiro. The lawful neutral who fulfills only that much, just wandering around being neutral; if he ever gets involved, he beats up members of both parties, of which, the fights are omitted to be left to the imagination, making it more dreadful than it already is. He is an absolutely pointless character, and the only time he ever did something with some effect to it is when he tried to share certain plot details which obfuscate details and make things more mysterious. Thankfully though, I'll close things off with the one character who DOES stand out as a good character - better than the series does justice to, which is Hanemura. He starts out as a bit of a spineless but sincere and rational guy who learns to fight under Mahiro's tutelage and gradually becoming more outspoken and vigorous after going through all the physical duress of Mahiro's training and emotional turmoil of all the other characters angsting and complaining around him, leading to the powerful scene of him kicking Mahiro and Yoshino's asses when things get out of hand. He's a stand up guy and he sets things straight when the plot is wrought with too much self-indulgence, anguish and melodrama, making him a refreshing change, ironically he is introduced in the second cour when all else goes to crap, so that in itself is a plus. At the end of the day, Hanemura breaks the series out of its conceited shell, but when leveled with the general character decay and initial merely decent characterization plus Junichirou, I can't give the roster a pass.\\n\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: Blast of Tempest being animated by Bones is a good sign. The very same company known for works such as both Fullmetal Alchemist adaptations, Wolf's Rain, RahXephon and many more nice looking series, and Blast of Tempest upholds some degree of that quality in its appearance. The characters are almost never off model, everything is smoothly rendered, clean and sharp looking and can pull off some more dynamic action scenes well, but those scenes are rather few and far between, and there's still much better out there, so it isn't THAT remarkable. The artwork looks really nice too thankfully, capturing the look of the manga well, with the designs being very sharp to begin with so the series looks cool at the very least. \\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The score is a rather enticing collection of melancholic orchestral pieces with bits of whimsy, mystery, grandiose and tragedy to them. There also happens to be select Beethoven pieces bundled in, so you know there's quality classical pieces to be had in this series, so that music happens to be the strongest department for this anime. The voice work on the other hand, is about average; characters come off as one note a lot of the time and lack a bit of enthusiasm at times, but the voices fit the characters well and performances are still consistent and serviceable. \\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: For me, enjoyment tends to run concurrent with story, and even if an anime may come off as \"boring\" in terms of tone and atmosphere to some, if there is some weighty metatheming or elaborate writing and intrigue permeating over the course of things, I won't get bored personally. However, as my story section dictates, there was hardly anything worthwhile for me to chew on. If Blast of Tempest were a steak, it would be a bland, dry and tough to chew on one. I was bored watching it most of the time because things always meandered and there wasn't much intellectual meat to it, and a lot of it was far below average. Blast of Tempest was just a really stale journey. \\n\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, Blast of Tempest is one of those series that falls into-nay, EPITOMIZES the cliche of a lot of anime out there: interesting concept, poor execution (in this case, hardly any). It's one of the most sloggish and inflated series I've ever seen that clings to its premise like a pure catholic teen clings to his/her chastity. The series had a cool idea that was rather intriguing, but it didn't know how to expand on it, so they just run around haphazardly with it and start randomly expounding Shakespeare references to try and uphold the air of assured direction when they haven't a clue what they are doing. \"Okay, so I've hooked them with the premise and I gotta make a series with this, but I have no idea what to do next...GOT IT! I'll have the characters quote Shakespeare because HE'S intelligent, so that will make them think THIS SERIES is still intelligent! Perfect!\" Blast of Tempest is a stretched out, pretentious (I try to use this word sparingly) and unexciting odyssey (if you can even call it that) and it is not worth your time. Don't be fooled by the Shakespeare references, this series is hardly smart at all, don't waste your time on it. Do yourself a favour and just read Spiral by the same author, it's a mystery that's worth it, Shirodaira just dropped the ball here.",

            "content": "This is one of the best psychological anime that I have ever seen till now (Might change in the future if I stumble upon another anime which is even greater than this). Let\u2019s find out why is it the best psychological anime, Shall we?\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThis was just wonderfully written and done. It was simply epic. I don\u2019t marathon a anime in a single day but Zetsuen no Tempest made me marathon it in just a day. This was an anime which I shall call the mother of all plot twists. You will think exactly the opposite of what will happen *no let me correct that*No you are actually made to think the opposite of exactly what will happen. I still wonder how this isn't in the top 100. This should be rated even higher than it\u2019 current ran of 277th. I did not expect disappointment when I picked this show and it didn't give me disappointment either. All the questions we have near the end of the anime are answered (Well that was for me though). The story was at a really good pace and even leaving a few hours for some work will make you want to watch the next episode and find out what is going on. It\u2019s that kind of feeling I had.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNow this was another brilliant part of the anime. The 2 OP as well as the 2 ED will not disappoint you (ED 1 made me sleepy actually). The OP 1 was completely sung in English by Nothing\u2019s Craved in stone, yes you heard me right. It\u2019s a full English OP and not a semi one and it was damn good to listen to. They have also sung OP 2 of Psycho Pass too. The OST were pretty well done and a few were done by the people in Key and the OST just fit in with the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThey weren't uninteresting nor interesting, they were just good and they did their roles well. The 2 male MC were just brilliant (in terms of having brains.) They both were intelligent but they both had their own separate ways in dealing with the same problem. We were also shown of a few side characters past or we were more exposed to them = learning who and how they are. So it didn't suck there. We were introduced to a lot of characters but the main side characters behaviours and how they truly are were shown which is supposed to be important in all anime. We also had a few plot twists in the characters itself too.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain this was good. There were some parts where it did go downhill for a few secs but they were ok for me as the story is more important to me. The CG were pretty good too. The CG didn't even feel like it was Different. The OP2 introduced to us the new characters and it was enjoyable looking at it. Well there was not much here for me\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it pretty well. There were few episodes of enjoyment + it did keep me entertained the entire anime. So if you think this is all a serious anime then you are wrong. There of course need to be fun time too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A Really good psychological + supernatural anime I would recommend to watch\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 8.8\\n\\n\r\nPersonal note: These are entirely my opinions and you don\u2019t have to agree or disagree with me.",

            "content": "The first episode of this series was most impressive.  To be fair, it blew me away.  First the artwork - it set the tone for the anime.  It wasn't cutesy or cartoonish at all (nothing wrong with that) but showed a kind of muted realism, both in the characters' drawing and the scenery.  It elevated the anime in some ways.  Also the almost understated tension in the first episode showed something I'd not seen before.  So I was very much interested to watch on.\r\nThe premise of the whole story was also fascinating.  As well as having magic, amurder mystery, and some bizarre butterflies and floating eyeball fruit, this anime, for me, was set apart from the pack.\\n\\n\r\nThe initial set up to the story was intriguing, and the characters had a kind of gritty realism about them.  Combined with a catchy opening sequence, the series showed a hell of a lot of promise.  Promise that ultimately was unfulfilled.  The end left me with unrequited yearning.  Allow me to explain.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to sum up the series in one word it would be \"slow\".  The pace of the anime was just too darned slow.  From memory I could only remember a few occasions where I REALLY wanted to watch on.  And although there were a few minor surprises and twists (none which you wouldn't be able to guess yourself if you're bright enough) the anime just did not seem to have the pace that it promised from the first episode.  Much of the series was taken up by somewhat pointless dialogue which kind of droned on.  I kept asking myself when something would happen, then the episode would end and I was left with a feeling of \"what the...?\"\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say there aren't some good elements to the anime.  I thought the music used was very atmospheric, appropriate and really added tension to the dramatic aspects.  The art was also superb, it was really something, and for the most part I enjoyed watching it for that aspect.\\n\\n\r\nBut having finished I couldn't shake the niggling feeling there was something essential lacking.  It's hard to put one's finger on it.  The artwork was great, the music fantastic, the characters original and unique...  But Zetsuen no Tempest was ultimately unable to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly the characters.  The first half of the series was difficult to watch because there were no protagonists who the viewer could identify with or even like, except for a mage who is stuck on a deserted island in the middle of nowhere and can only communicate through a wooden doll.  Mahiro is not a likeable hero, and does not seem to pretend to be one either.  So we follow his angry, selfish motives for vengeance as he tries to find the killer of his sister.  And on the flip side of the coin we have Yoshino, who is nebulous at best.  He barely reacts to anything, and it's hard to drum up any feeling for this deadpan character.  Even at the end I wasn't sure if I liked him or not.  I suppose I would say I didn't really care.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the series was also somewhat disappointing.  All the potential conflicts and plot lines are too conveniently tied up, and they don't really go anywhere.  It was disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nThe constant references to Shakespeare were interesting... sort of.  The characters have this thing where they start spurting random quotes form the Tempest and Hamlet.  Others have said this is a strength of the anime, but personally I'm not so sure.  It appears forced initially and out of place.  Even I can start spouting Shakespeare if I wanted: \"When we are born we cry that we are come to this great stage of fools\"... but I'm not sure why I would do it ...  At the end they tie in the two Shakespearean references somewhat nicely, so I guess it wasn't all bad.\\n\\n\r\nI'd give it a go if you like slow paced character driven anime.  Being a fan of fantasy genres in general, I wouldn't have high hopes for that aspect of the story as the mages' \"powers\" are kind of limited and in the end don't really mean much or add anything to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nOverall: 6",

            "content": "Before getting into the review, let me say that, Zetsuen no Tempest is heavily linked with the works of William Shakespeare. The Tempest and Hamlet are the two pieces used and having some prior knowledge on these two texts does help fully appreciate Zetsuen no Tempest. If you have an indepth understanding of both of the plays you'll be able to notice the similarities and predict some scenarios beforehand. However, the anime does a good job of not making it a prerequisite and thus the general audience will be able to follow. Simply put, the major difference between the two is that; Hamlet is atragedy while The Tempest ends happily. There are many references of the two pieces, while the plot and characters are heavily influenced from both The Tempest and Hamlet. \\n\\n\r\nThe first episode sets the up the plot and wastes no time in getting into the action. From the episode, it's evident that there are two main complications. The first is of the death of Aika Fuwa (Mahrio's sister), and Mahiro is trying to hunt the killer himself. The second key plot is about the Kurasibe Clan. Hazkaze (female lead) is stranded on an island, because Samon (Kurasibe Clan leader) wants to awaken the Tree of Exodous. Simply put, there is the possibility of an apocalyptic-type destruction to occur if the tree is awoken from its slumber. The two stories approach closer and closer, as the series progresses only to tangle into one bigger picture.\\n\\n\r\nZetusen no Tempest does a good job of making it appear more complicated than it really is. The basic plot is covered with mystery and psychological elements which are used to disrupt the predictability. New aspects are continuously added to create unexpected moments and attempt to confuse the audience. \\n\\n\r\nZetsuen no Tempest has a lead dual protagonist, of equal position, which is pretty rare and difficult to pull off. However it manages to do it exceptionally well and thus characters Mahiro and Yoshino are appealing. Mahiro started off as someone who was blinded for revenge, but only to become more mature and calm than at first. Yoshino appears as an innocent bystander, but as the story progresses, the perception of his character changes. They give mutual assurance to each other as arise, which helps advance the story. Their relationship starts as friends, with some background to it, but changes overtime. Bonds are tested by issues and complications arise which can only deepen or break friendships.\\n\\n\r\nHakaze Kusaribe is a sorceress and the strongest one in history. Hakaze isn't as central as the duo but still went through some growth and change. Her selflessness was the most evident part of her personality, and thus it goes through the biggest development. She is the strongest magic user and thus becomes an invaluable person in most of the situations in combat. Her relationship with the other characters can only grow after being in isolation for so long, and she begins emotions she hasn't felt before. \\n\\n\r\nSecondary characters weren't as influential but they were important to the initial advancement of the story. They each had a role to create a complication, helping the main characters mature. They played apart in conversations and various narrations. But towards the second half, they began to lose their purpose as the main plot was becoming uncovered. Their roles started declining and becoming almost generic, like a backdrop to the scenes.  \\n\\n\r\nThe latter half of the series lacked what made the first half so special. In the first half , the predictability was never there because the characters were indefinite. They still weren't fully matured and thus could do the unexpected by, having a change of heart. The plot was also purposely undeveloped but flexible allowing it to potentially stray off into any direction. In the second half, the general plot was revealed and thus it loses its charm of secrecy. However, it does a solid job of maintaining the major mystery of Aika's death until the very end. Zetsuen no Tempest had the choice of either ending as The Tempest or Hamlet. Though I won't say how it ends, the one it does choose is rather forcible.\\n\\n\r\nThe use of magic brings a supernatural theme, but takes away some of its realism. And thankfully it did not go over the top with the use of magic. Its primary uses were for combat, destruction and for some odd bits and pieces. It wasn't a major part of the anime, but instead adds another dimension of possibilities to the already flexible plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe depressed atmosphere goes well with the world ending theme. There was little action in general but for the small pieces of combat were animated nicely. The fighting scene act as a change of pace from the rest of the anime. There was a good amount of it, never too much or too little. The art-style looked good and consistent throughout. While the character models depicted the personalities of the characters. The soundtrack worked well and only enhanced the mood.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end the anime handled itself well and its ending that ties up the ends. The series as a whole, balances all the components, and has an excellent cast of characters. Although the first half is noticeably better than the second and attempts to force a specific ending, but no doubt it was worth the watch.",

            "content": "My favorite anime this season, really interesting story that pays homage to Shakespeare's Hamlet and The Tempest while integrating its own original storyline and unique characters.\r\nZetsunen no Tempest, a story of revenge and tragedy. Referencing Shakespeare's Hamlet, the story portrayed can lead to tragic end of revenge where sadness is reflected with more sadness. However, there is also The Tempest, the alternative end to a story of revenge. An ending where all is forgiven and sadness is repaid with forgiveness and happiness.\r\nStory:\r\nAmazing plot, the story of revenge leads the audience to decide whether the ending should be one of tragedy or happy ending. Loved howZetsuen no Tempest tells a story of magic and mythology, at the same time giving the possibility that what seems like magic and gods could merely be science at a level above one's comprehension. The story involves a lot of psychology theme which is a favorite of mine. Questioning just how one should response to loss of loved one, by either responding with desire for revenge or to continue living a normal life. Honestly this story deserves a higher rating than 8, a majority of top animes with high ratings are romance comedy. This story is interesting! It helps question what it means to be human, whether being logical all the time is appropriate or to express those emotions we humans were given to show. Using the words from Hamlet and The Tempest, truly made the story more elegant and beautiful. Showing that humans not only desire a meaningful life, but a meaningful death. Not to mention Zetsuen no Tempest help question whether lifes' coincidences are just coincidences or do they tie to pre destined state of events in life.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nEnjoyed the art definitely, characters were well design. Loved how Aika's death was shown to be mysterious, beautiful and meaningful when given reason for her death but also cold and tragic without understanding what was the point of her death. Mahiro's character art was well drawn as well, his appearance gave off a rebellious leader aura that was recklessly yet rational. Yoshino's character art was also well suited for his character and personality, looking somewhat regular like character but hiding a calculative intelligent persona that at times lack delicacy due to experience.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe classical use of music helped produced the atmosphere really well. Music being classical really help Zetsuen no Tempest relate to Shakespeare's Hamlet and the Tempest even most so. Not much to say otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nLoved all the characters, especially Aika for being the mastermind behind our 2 protagonists' journey for revenge and truth. Aika (also voiced by my favorite seiyuu) was my favourite, her personality being a little bit of everything. Strong and cold by being able to make the decision of her death all on her own, playing an act in front of Mahiro with Yoshino to keep their relationship a secret. Yet having a soft, warm and playful side to her that is somewhat childish at times. During times with her and just Yoshino or arguing with Mahiro because neither were afraid of her but rather felt the need to protect her frail looking appearance. Yoshino was my favourite character for first half of the story, being able to calmly make decisions and act out of rationality, adapting when necessary. Being perfect yet imperfect was what made him interesting. Since Aika mentioned that Yoshino is able to be calm and act rational at all times is because he goes with the flow adapting when necessary, able to be everything appropriate but unable to be individual. Mahiro wasn't much of a favorite character but likable nevertheless. A typical rebellious cold and cool character, reckless yet has good rational than most rebellious characters would. Hakaze being the opposite half of Aika was good to have. A sheltered princess unknowing to common sense, having an outward tough exterior but is actual frail on the inside being the maiden she is. Complete opposite of Aika who was frail in appearance but strong willed in personality, complementing each other's character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nProbably one of my new top favorites indefinitely, since its rare to have good tragedy stories. Not to mention a tragedy story with a good turn around. Plus despite the continuous bombardment of tragic plot events, it had some slight comedic relief time to time to help keep the story from being depressing. One of my favorite reasons that I enjoyed this story was that it was not 2 protagonist with special traits or abilities, but rather 2 ordinary high school students at a unique place at a unique time, making it very adaptive to the idea that no matter how normal the life you live is. You are your own protagonist in your own story. An enjoyable story of what may seem like predetermined act with actors following a script, but it is the actor's will to carry out those lines.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The first half of the anime was theatrical, morose and stylish (yellow butterflies, humans turned into metal statues, faintly Lovecraftian environmental apocalypse, Kabbalism and Shakespeare go surprisingly well together). It had a certain charm, even if the characters talked their mouths off and the action moved a bit slowly.\r\nThen the second half completely changed the tone. Everything started revolving around Hakaze's juvenile, banal crush on Yoshino. The fate of the world and the revenge plot took second stage to the riveting sight of Hakaze going kyaa and smashing her breasts against Yoshino's arm every two minutes. Quality storytelling, that. -_-\r\nSo if you don't mind aninteresting premise turning halfway through into a run of the mill romantic comedy about the relationship angst of a hormonal teenager, you can watch this. Otherwise give Zetsuen a wide berth.",

            "content": "Zetsuen No Tempest is one of those series that you'll come across accidentally, instead of getting it recommended from an anime-loving friend, and after finishing it, you'll be scratching your head, wondering why it isn't higher up in the rankings. But what makes it so good? Let's find out, shall we?\r\nStory:\r\nAt first, the story may seem like a typical shonen; the two main characters are trying to save the world, with the help of a stranger, from a seemingly evil group (and a tree!). However, as you progress through the series, you'll start realizing there's a lot more than to what meets the eye. Thestory becomes a roller-coaster ride midway and until the end, you'll be on the edge of the seat, captivated by the flow of the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the weakest point of the series. Although it's not horrible, the art is not exceptional either, and the animation does no justice to the series, with regular animation errors that you can't help but face-palm at. Try not to be too hung up on the errors, or it might be make the experience a bit more unpleasant.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe music is pretty decent, in my opinion. The first opening, Spirit Inspiration, is a fun ride (although its lyrics make no sense), and he two endings are a pleasant experience. The background music is also well done, with each piece setting the mood properly, if not perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly the best part of the series. Each character is different from the other. Most of them, including the supporting protagonists, have character developments which range from good to amazing. The dialogues are the highest points of the show, with frequent references to Shakespearean plays  like Hamlet and The Tempest which are used to great effect.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I was pretty skeptical of the show at first. Little did I know though, it would be one hell of a hectic ride that would keep my eyes glued to the screen at all times and prevent me from ever wanting to take a break.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Zetsuen No Tempest is like a sports car you haven't used in a long time: it takes some time to get to its best, but when it does, you won't look back. It's a gem of a series which deserves a lot of recognition, and I can safely say it is one of the finest anime I've seen in my life.",

            "content": "Would you obliterate this world for the sake of someone you love? Would you go against the logic of the world to achieve your goals?\r\nZetsuen No Tempest  is a masterly written piece of work that challenges the watcher to reflect on their ideas of death, love, and logic. I started this anime with low expectations. I am a rather optimistic person, and the premise of a dystopic world did not attract much enthusiasm from me. Zestuen No Tempest, however, is not just a story of some parallel dystopian world, but rather a personal story involving love and tragedy. \r\nStory\r\nZNT prides itself in their storytelling. Yes, there are numerous action scenes to gratify our blood-thirsty anime watching peers but these are not the most impressive features of the anime. The splendidity is established in the plot and dialog. ZNT did a great job with dialog.  The initial proposition of the anime were not striking. You have a world where there is a special clan, called the Kusaribe, that can manipulate technology to use their power, which they call magic. It seems like this \u201cmagic\u201d comes from a tree, and the magic can only be used to enforce the world's logic. Nothing mind blowing.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is less about magic but rather the peculiar circumstances of the two main characters, Fuwa Mahiro and Takigawa Yoshino. These two characters are both thrown into this surreal world of magic after the murder of their beloved, Fuwa Aika. Mahiro is bent on avenging his little sister, while Yoshino is struggling to find inner peace with this news. These two personalities are the driving force of the plot. \\n\\n\r\nI think Yoshino and Mahiro had a terrific dynamic that kept me in the edge of my seat, at least, during the first half of the anime. Yoshino and Mahiro are supposedly friends, but their relationship are at first pictured ambiguously. Their devious personalities made me suspicious of their real motives, but it is those parts that made the anime so intense and eye grabbing. \\n\\n\r\nThough the anime is rather dark, there are comedic elements that help alleviate some of the darkness that surrounds the story. I am not a fan of \"fan service\" but there were some of it in the anime. It was all nicely placed and didn't interfered with the viewing experience. Some of it was actually nicely appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of this anime was phenomenal. The intensity of those  first few episodes were unprecedented in my experience, and the most surprising part was how they executed it. I will not spill spoilers, but those parts were dialog-driven, and it is spectacular how those scenes captured you into the story and made your mind thrilled at every new twist. \\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the anime was not as intense as the first half, but by no mean was it sub par. The second half just added more to the story. The introduction of a certain anticipated female character was the main event, but there were other factors that made the second half excellent.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give the story 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe scores says it all. Not much to explain.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the second half's opening and closing more than the first half's Op and Ed. Both of them were good.\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM was excellent and fit every scene. It was so unique and theatrical in it's volume and instrument used.  The epicness, the intensity, and the dystopia shown were all equally fitted with superb background music. \\n\\n\r\nWill definitely check out the OST when I get the chance.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned earlier that the plot drives the anime, and while this is true, it is the characters that pushes the plot forward. ZNT did not flesh out every character that were introduced ( there were some characters that we never even got to see at all) but they managed to really fulfill the characters that were the most central to their story. These central characters would be Mahiro, Yoshino, Hazake, and Aika.\\n\\n\r\nMahiro- He was my favorite character of the series. His intellect could not be denied, his will power was impeccable, and his vengeance nothing to play with.  I felt bad for him throughout the anime since it seemed like he was the one in most pain, and I couldn't see a good ending for him emotionally. One that is driven for revenge usually doesn't have the best ending. There was character development and Mahiro did change a bit, though he would deny it. I like seeing his interactions with others, though Mahiro seems like he can do it all, he does have trouble with communication, which gave some good comedic relief on my part. Liked his character design.\\n\\n\r\nYoshino- I have mixed feelings about this character. I mostly like him but I still feel like we didn't really get to delve into who Yoshino really is. I get it. He prides himself in not showing his emotion to anyone, but you would think that we would at least get a glimpse, as us watchers, to his inner attitude towards other characters. Besides that, I really enjoyed this character. He is not your typical MC, he is smart, conscious, and and not afraid to get his hand dirty. He is a complex character, and you always want your MC to be more than one dimensional. Unique character design, but looks like Light Yagami in some angles.\\n\\n\r\nHazake: I did not like her at first, but she grew on me over time. She's smart, but has an annoying attitude. She is extremely arrogant. This makes sense however, since she was raised as a princess, and is the strongest person of the Kusaribe tribe. She grew on me later, because we got to see different sides of her, and it made her more human to me. I grew very fond of her. Typical but fitting character design. She was a bit too short for my opinion. Maybe she has a Napoleon complex......\\n\\n\r\nAika: The mysterious girl that has captured the heart of the two main MCs and thrown logic out of joint. The girl in love with Shakespeare tragedies, and can be seen religiously quoting verses from Hamlet and Tempest. I enjoyed Aika. I think the anime foreshadowed her to be this special and unique character, and I thought they were doing too much with all her flashbacks, but in the end, Aika in full glory was all that I thought she would be. Her witty remarks, her dark humor, her sexual teasing, I loved it all. She certainly deserves all the attention given to her in Zetsuen No Tempest. Pretty Character design, seems to be in contrast to Hazake's design. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nZetsuen No Tempest was a heck of a ride. The first half shined as bright as any anime I have ever seen, and the second half was spectacular in their transition. The theme of the anime about wanting to change the world for someone you love is reiterated and explained throughout the anime. There are numerous quotes from Hamlet and Tempest, and I would be surprised if one is not at least tempted to get into Shakespeare after completing this anime. The enjoyment was out of the roof for me, I initially gave this anime an 9/10...but there was two episode in the second half that boosted the anime to a perfect score. \\n\\n\r\nBut the anime was not perfect, there were some underwhelming parts, but overall, I cannot disregard the tremendous excitement that I felt while watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this to anyone that enjoys a great Ost, drama, love, and battle of wits. \\n\\n\r\nOutstanding (10/10)",

            "content": "Here we have, a superb series that didnt get the spotlight it deseved. The Fall 2012 anime season brought a lot of fan favorite series that would have viewers buzzing so other anime would be dropped. Zetsuen no Tempest was unfortunate, for some, to be part of the latter.\r\nStudio Bones animates another Shonen Gangan manga, but unlike some of their previous adaptions it's not pragmatic and has no gecko ending. Meaning it follows the story all the way through. Some scenes are altered and arranged differently from the original manga but they're arguably improvements. The plot of the anime, even if not original is executedvery well. From episode 5 and onwards there's at least one twist or revelation in every episode and Zetsuen no Tempest does this without getting convoluted. It starts out as a simple story about revnge but expands the plot to a worldly scale. \\n\\n\r\nAs stated earlier the anime is by Studio Bones so it's given high production values in it's art and animation. The character designs are very attractive; the hairstyles and outfits are very detailed and the colors are deep and vibrant, especially in the character's eyes. The CGI also adds to a beautiful experience, most notably in the action scenes and the animation of butterflies.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters meant to be based off those in Shakespeare's works. Mahiro as Prince Hamlet(Hamlet), Yoshino as Romeo Montague(Romeo & Juliet), Hakaze as Prospero(The Tempest), and Aika as Sycorax(The Tempest) and Ophelia(Hamlet). However, due to the plot of the story, the characters' actions differ and they're spared some of the angst found in a Shakespeare play. In fact Yoshino, Aika, Mahiro(and Hakaze later on) are aware of Shakespeare's works and make a point to not \"let this story end in tragedy). Mahiro is a straightforward, almost stereotypically shonen protagonist, main character. He has an unfettered mind consumed by revenge, yet even he has some wits about him. Yoshino, is a \"Beware the nice guy\" type who isnt afraid to turn into a manipulative bastard. Mahiro doesnt care about the world and even he finds Yoshino ruthless. Hakaze, despite her upbringing is spunky and probably gets the most character development in the series. Then there's Aika, the posthumous chracter, who has a huge impact on the plot, and is brig something to look forward to in the flashbacks as she steals scenes. The supporting cast is pretty small so they're given a lot of screen time to be memorable. All in all , this show has good characterization.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is ambitious. It alludes to Shakesperean plays by using deep, orchestral sounds in the episodes.  The first opener is a solid rock song and the second one is more melodic and quite possibly fits the show better based off it's lyrics. As for the ending themes, \"Happy Endings\" and \"Bokutachi no Uta\" may feel out of place but are enjoyable nonetheless. If the sound doesnt interest you the voice acting will. Particulary, Toshiyuki Toyanaga whose playing against his type as Mahiro. Toyanaga delves so deep into the role he uses an unrecognizable voice. Still, the rest of the actors are strong. Kouki Uchiyama gives a heartstring pulling perfomance as Yoshino in episode 18. Meanwhile, Miyuki Sawashiro's Hakaze is very spirited and Kana Hanazawa gives Aika an enchanting voice. Rikiya Koyama delivers Samon's inner thoughts effectively.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is an issue with Zetsuen no Tempest it's episodes 10-12. What was meant to be a showdown comes out as a debate of sorts, and after some impressive fight scenes, the clever dialogue of the show might not appeal to everyone.\\n\\n\r\nEarlier in the review I wrote that some people may have dropped this anime but for the people who stuck with it, they can tell you that the show kept them on the edge of their seats. I would obviously agree. With all the drama, dailogue, and plot of this show waiting for a new episode every week was almost painful. And now that it's over I'm almost going to feel abandoned.\\n\\n\r\nFor all the reasons I put in this review, I'm willing to consider this show a masterpiece. At the risk of sounding like a weaboo I think this is the \"BEST ANIME EVER\" but I know it wont take the #1 spot on MAL because it's got traits that will turn some viewers. Even so, I highly recommend it.",

It has a quick story line that is fast paced but is still a longer story that is pretty  hard to predict even if you think hard about it, it will just change completely.So overall its an amazing anime. It has many genres that are enjoyable, Great story, Beautiful artwork, Interesting characters, Ever changing plot and much more.",

The story is original, the characters are great, and the artwork is beautiful. There is quite a bit of action in Zetsuen no Tempest but it's the dialogue that will keep you on the edge of your seat, especially in the later episodes. It's what happens when there is no real \"bad guy\" and both sides are desperately fighting for what they truly and honestly believe is right. These shows are always so muchmore intense and so much better than your typical \"I'm doing this because I'm evil and you're here to stop me because you're good.\" shows. I highly recommend this show to everyone.",

            "content": "\u201cWhat\u2019s past is prologue.\u201d - The Tempest - William Shakespeare\r\nNothing could say more about Blast of Tempest than Shakespeare\u2019s The Tempest which is heavily referenced throughout the series.  Blast of Tempest is a story about overcoming entrapment in the past, both figuratively and literally.\r\nStory\r\nOne thing that can be said about Blast of Tempest is that it follows a logical premise that manages to feel legitimately inspired despite its fair share of twists.  Even though the story involves magic, the series defines a strong logical framework that both empowers and entraps its characters.\r\nAbove all, our character\u2019s personal history is a major factor in theseries.  It drives Mahiro on a vengeful path to determine who killed his sister and weighs down Yoshino to the point of near-detachment.  It is only when these characters are able to accept fate and focus that they are able to allow a tragic event to become the means to a better end (saving the world).  Moreover, past as a general influence is extremely well-realized.  Events in the past, including Hakaze\u2019s imprisonment, Aika\u2019s death, and even further back to the formation of the Tree of Exodus as a means to end the Tree of Genesis\u2019s purpose in resetting humanity are central to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the notion of order and chaos is thematically prevalent in the series.  Even though the Tree of Genesis represents order, it is only with the chaos represented by the Tree of Exodus that humanity can thrive and even exist.  Despite the resurgence of crime and inequality after the dissolution of the Tree of Genesis, it is easy to understand the necessity in the action and why the order imposed by the Tree of Genesis would eventually deem all of humanity unrighteous.\\n\\n\r\nThe only major flaw to Blast of Tempest\u2018s story is that it tends to use its characters as if they are actors in a play (perhaps intentionally).  Each character plays his part, often without question.  This is extremely noticeable in Aika\u2019s casual acceptance of her fate despite what clearly would have been a difficult decision \u2013 but this may actually speak more to her character than to the show\u2019s tendency to have its actors fill a role.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is very important in Blast of Tempest - and all of its main characters, Hakaze, Yoshino, Mahiro and Aika, are a strong basis to the show\u2019s central themes despite their differing personas.  What enforces their strength is their intelligence \u2013 even in Mahiro\u2019s case \u2013 the characters carefully and cleverly plan their actions.\\n\\n\r\nHakaze is a strong female lead that is open and direct, while sometimes being too upfront and occasionally becoming distracted by desire.  What defines Hakaze the most is that, despite her attunement to the Tree of Genesis, she is far from unquestioning.  Her actions are often fueled by her desire to seek her own path, even with opposition or without knowing the consequences.  It makes her into a character nearly embracing chaos despite the order surrounding her \u2013 which accentuates her foil in Aika.\\n\\n\r\nAika, though appearing frail, is strong to a fault.  Her character embraces the ideology of Exodus far too unconditionally which is but testament to her acceptance with being an actress in a play.  She often quotes Hamlet and The Tempest because she feels that her only goals have already been previously scripted and she must play to those ideals.\\n\\n\r\nMahiro, on the other hand, represents another extreme of chaos with his absolute path of vengeance.  His early ambitions are simply to avenge the death of Aika, but this actually drives him to greatness because of her involvement in much more crucial matters.  When he is freed from this path, his goal has actually become to enact a plan to save the world.  Mahiro is a renegade without being overly reckless and ambitious to a point where he is not clouded.\\n\\n\r\nYoshino, for a large majority of the show, is very detached.  Aika\u2019s death had an opposing effect on him in that he nearly lost desire to function after her passing.  Even though he is tied down by her loss, he thinks clearly and keeps Mahiro in check when he is pushing himself too far.  It\u2019s important to note that Yoshino is the last character to resolve his past as a lesson in history, because he is too entrapped by it.  Hakaze\u2019s confessions to him cause him to break because he is not ready to continue his life until all others\u2019 problems have been resolved.\\n\\n\r\nQuality\\n\\n\r\nBlast of Tempest is breathtaking visually and its usage of classical pieces in its soundtrack is excellently done.  By now, this is what we expect from BONES, so it isn\u2019t too unbelievable that this show lives up to BONES\u2019s capability to generate quality in its production value.  Particularly of note are the show\u2019s excellent action scenes that accentuate brilliant animation along with well-utilized classical music.\\n\\n\r\nClosing\\n\\n\r\nWhile Blast of Tempest occasionally falls short of absolute excellence in its willingness to allow its characters to fill roles, it presents a story of past entanglements that is very well-realized and non-contradictory with a cast that synergizes their differing viewpoints.\\n",

            "content": "Zetsuen no Tempest is an action/supernatural/shonen anime by studio Bones, known for its previous works Eureka Seven, Fullmetal Alchemist, Star Driver, etc. Tempest starts out as a very promising shonen anime with interesting characters and an elaborate setup in a world full of turmoil. Preferring to skip the dramatic buildup, Tempest throws you right into the action and chaos right from the very first episode. Its steady pacing keeps the viewers on the edge of their seat and eager for more of the story. It\u2019s too bad that Tempest doesn\u2019t keep this up for the whole series. Halfway through, the show takes a serious dipin quality in just about every area, aside from maybe animation and sound.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s a shame because Zetsuen no Tempest had so much potential, but it falls flat on its face instead. But let\u2019s talk about the good of this show first. The art and animation are top notch. Studio Bones pulled no punches when it came to the gorgeous animation and character designs. The battles are fast, fluid, and intense, going hand in hand with the spectacular and vivid wheel of colors that enhance the magical effects. The character designs are stylish and unique, with no two characters looking too much alike. Another small little detail that was well done was the character\u2019s clothing. Each character\u2019s various clothing looks like something straight out of a teen fashion magazine; very funky and stylish. Small artistic details are also added in the character\u2019s hair and accessories. If I were rating this anime solely based on its art and animation, it would easily score a nine at the very least. Unfortunately, I did not, and I won\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the not-so-good of Zetsuen no Tempest, which is basically everything else. Perhaps the weakest aspect of the show is its story. The story starts out with Hakaze Kusaribe, the princess of a clan of mages, contacting Fuwa Mahiro to help her extinguish an uprising instigated by her followers. Left stranded on an island by said followers, they can only communicate through magic. Hakaze promises to help Mahiro find his sister\u2019s killer in exchange for his help. Mahiro\u2019s friend, Takigawa Yoshino comes along for the ride, and together the three aim to prevent the Kusaribe clan from awakening the tree of Exodus, which would subsequently bring destruction to the entire world. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire story pays homage to Shakespeare\u2019s works, namely The Tempest and Hamlet. For some reason, the story feels it needs to remind you of this quite frequently, as it seems every few minutes someone is throwing out a Shakespeare quote. There\u2019s no subtlety in its delivery, and the quotes have little meaning to the plot or the characters. It seems they simply threw in several quotes in order to make the script seemed more grand and classy. Instead, it ended up making the entire anime sound incredibly pretentious. It could be argued that the two differing plays were being quoted to signal that this anime could either have a happy or tragic ending, leaving the viewer to wonder in anticipation. But not only is that grasping at straws, it gives the writers more credit than they probably deserve. \\n\\n\r\nNow to be fair, the first half of the series was pretty good. It was standing on shaky ground but it was still quite good. It may have been standard shonen anime fare \u201csave the world with magical powers, stop the bad guys\u201d but it had an interesting enough twist to keep it afloat. The characters were interesting; they had clear cut motivations that at least made some sense. The plot moved about at a comfortable pace with just enough action and character development shimmied into each episode. The rules of the universe made sense. All that was completely ruined by its mess of a second half. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot begins to contradict the rules it established in its first half. It makes no effort to even make sense of Hakaze\u2019s ability to time travel for a second and third time. It presents a ridiculous plot twist that makes even less sense and gives a sort of barbaric edge to Aika\u2019s character that the other characters don\u2019t even bat an eye at. And worst of all, romance is shoehorned in for the sake of throwing in some aspects of a corny school love comedy. Hakaze even alludes to this in a hilarious 4th wall breaking internal monologue.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most disappointing aspects of the show is the degradation of its characters. Yes that\u2019s right, the very characters that made the show go backwards as it drags on. Perhaps the character that does it the most is Hakaze Kusaribe. She is initially presented as a strong heroine, with an arrogant edge that is backed up by her standing as the most powerful mage in the clan. She is cunning and unflinching, yet kind and caring when she needs to be. But of course that is all negated when she falls in love. \\n\\n\r\nYes, LOVE! She becomes clumsy, indecisive, and silly at the first hints of love. Her initial goal was to prevent the destruction of the world and take control of her clan once again. But when she falls in love, she leaves the fate of her clan in the hands of the guy who betrayed her and sent her to an island to die. All so she could travel freely with her love interest. Later, she wants to save the world simply for her love. To say anything else about her silly love driven mindset would mean spoilers, so to be vague, pay attention to what she says when she travels across time a second time. It is so unbelievably silly, bordering on completely idiotic. She goes from a strong heroine to someone whose sole reason for existing and acting is for her love.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe it wouldn\u2019t be that bad it we had some substantial buildup to the relationship, coupled with proof of an established and long-lasting bond that could never be broken. That, and if her feelings were actually reciprocated. Then it would be quite romantic and heroic that Hakaze would do anything for her love. But instead, her actions are based on a silly schoolgirl crush (that quite literally springs out of nowhere) and nothing more, making her actions and motivations seem incredibly idiotic. \\n\\n\r\nFuwa Mahiro and Takigawa Yoshino are perfect foils, making for a very interesting relationship between the two heroes. They get a significant amount of development in the first half of the show through a series of flashbacks, some of which involve Aika. Brash and arrogant Mahiro is the brawn of their duo, while the manipulative and analytical Yoshino is the brains. Their relationship is one of the most interesting ones of the series. How two young men who are so different from each other could end up cooperating so willingly and becoming the best of friends is a real mystery. But their actions in the second half become a bit odd to say the least. Not only that, but they show little emotion when finding out the truth behind Aika\u2019s death, despite the fact that they are the most important people to her. In fact, their lack of emotion is prevalent even in the first half. They are just normal high school boys, not hardened soldiers. Yet their reactions to the destruction of their home certainly don\u2019t give any hints to that. \\n\\n\r\nThen there is Fuwa Aika, one of the most confusing characters. She\u2019s already dead by the beginning of the series, yet still plays an important role in the story. She\u2019s the motivation for Yoshino and Mahiro\u2019s actions and appears in numerous flashbacks. Her character is described in the anime as having a \u201chorrible personality.\u201d That\u2019s not even the half of it. Her development at the tail end of the series hints at a facet of her personality that is far more barbaric, border lining on psychotic. The rest of the side characters are mostly just there for decoration. They are lively personalities to either spice things up or be used as a convenient plot device to move the story along. \\n\\n\r\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, Zetsuen no Tempest is not wholly unwatchable. There is plenty of enjoyment to be had watching this series, especially during the first half. It\u2019s just too bad that Bones screwed up the story and characters so hard during the second half that it irredeemably sours the entire series. The character\u2019s motivations during the second half make little to no sense. And trying to piece together why the characters are doing what they\u2019re doing gives way to the realization that these characters are acting like total idiots. The plot twist during the second half was also ridiculous, giving the viewer little justification for WHY things had to be this way. Not to mention the implausibility of the situation based purely on the rules set by the anime. \\n\\n\r\nZetsuen no Tempest is a great watch if you turn off your brain and just enjoy it for what it is: Your \u201conly very slightly above average until the second half of the show\u201d shonen anime. Anybody looking for anything more won\u2019t get much enjoyment out of this anime.  \\n",

            "content": "How should I say this... This anime was one of the best that I've seen. Whenever I have nothing to watch, I would turn to Zetsuen no Tempest (Blast of the Tempest/ The Civilization Blaster). The ending was perfect, the story line was amazing, but the best of all were the characters.\r\nLet me go into detail...\r\nStory: The story was put together in a great yet questionable way. There were many parts of the anime that could be related to the famous works of Shakespeare. With plot twists that would leave you confused, the story was never boring. The twisted tale of love, hate, revenge anda touch of magic was most definitely satisfying especially how the ending wrapped up the entire story. I sincerely wish that they would make a sequel.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was satisfying, it clearly showed details in the magic shields and barriers. They point that stood out the most for me were the eyes. The characters eyes showed their emotions so clearly that they sent shivers down my spine, how they would dull or brighten depending on the emotions being conveyed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music chosen for this anime was.... Fabulous. The violin solos with the varying volumes matched the pace of the show and the suspense in the best fashion. The opening and endings weren't boring and they definitely didn't reveal a lot about the story. The upbeat openings shows the action and the more aggressive emotions in the show whereas the slower themes in the endings portrays the more negative and deeper feelings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Gosh, all of the characters were so perfect. They each played a huge role in the story but I think I should be more specific. Takigawa Yoshino is my favorite character, he is so mysterious and he definitely is a major character. He is referred as Horatio in some parts of the anime. His tale of not being able to grieve for the one he loves is heart breaking, how he shows great deduction skills and how he seems so innocent is so twisted and yet it fits the story perfectly. Fuwa Mahiro is the rich and feared character. His feelings played a large role, I find his motives very amusing throughout the plot. Yoshino and Mahiro are very... different characters compared to the cliches that show up nowadays. When you expect them to do something, they do the complete opposite. But what scares and surprises me the most is the lack of response from the two of them, no matter what they can always appear calm. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I ranked this anime a 9/10. Although I would say that it's closer to a 9.5/10. XD\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review, so I hope I did well...",

            "content": "Some secrets are better left dead.\r\nYet, in some ways, they always seem to come back from the past and continue to be part of your lives. It's like when you go through a photo album and you see that one picture which strikes you the most. You take out that picture and examines it carefully and take a trip down memory lane. However, in this series, that memory lane isn't a happy memory. No, in fact, it's one ride you wish you'd never had taken because from that event, things are never the same again.\r\nZetsuen no Tempest (also known as Blast of Tempest) is ananime series adapted from the manga of the same name handled by Bones. The studio is already known for some of their other works with the supernatural/super power themes such as Full Metal Alchemist, Darker than Black, and Star Driver. Their latest title in their line of evolution of works is this little gem. Written by Kyou Shirodaira, the series follows the aftermath involving  lives of two best friends after the events of a tragic past. To uncover the mysteries of the past, they seek the help of a powerful magician and with their help might find the answer they are looking for. At the same time, it's up to the duo to stop a mysterious clan on the horizon to prevent the end of the world. \\n\\n\r\nSounds all intriguing and mind bobbling right? Well, that's what it seems at first especially with the rather confusing pilot episode...\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, there are many questions that seems to need answers not only revolving for the main protagonists but for ourselves as well. It's no surprise there is so much mystery involved either considering the author of the series is also involved in another mystery title, Spiral: The Bonds of Reasoning. The pilot episode suggests this with introduction of the main characters and a small glimpse of their mysterious past. Curiously enough, we also see the \u201cmage in the barrel\u201d (as the pilot episode suggests) that may make us scratch our heads a bit more. In fact, we can even see blood and tragedy already from the backgrounds. Furthermore, there seems to be a barrage of butterflies roaming in the air as well as the monotonic speeches from the main protagonists. To add to the package, we have some action including a dark haired beauty, shounen-style action gags, and a seemingly civilization that is in ruins for God-knows-what reasons with a touch of magic. All sound mind bobbling, doesn't it? For some reason, it's how the series begin and towards the ends it shows the dark revelation of a tragedy. In order to embrace on what's to come, it's imperative to watch the series with some insight and with your brains focused on more than just the pretty visuals.\\n\\n\r\nOh but visuals itself doesn't just represent Zetusen no Tempest. It's a bit more than that. For fans of Shakespeare, this could be a delight of those into his literature. As a matter of fact, a few of the dialogues and characters may represent his works themselves. For example, the term \u201cTempest\u201d could be a homage of Shakespeare's work of \u201cThe Tempest\u201d, which was assumed to be one of his last creations. The themes from that play such as an island setting, magic, and those bits of romance suggests this and be converted into modern times. It's quite appealing to watch though as most of us who attends those boring English classes at high school and sleeping through discussions (you know who you are) might get a pleasant surprise at this series. If not, well then, tough break.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of the series seems to be quite attractive not only with the mysterious backgrounds but also the way it is presented. The Tree of Exodus seems to play a prominent role to determine the fate of the world by the way everyone tries to learn and awaken its power. It can also be implied that the Tree of Exodus may be a key to unlock the main protagonists' past tragedies and the truth they are looking for. Nevertheless, it is definitely important since everyone wishes to get to it before the others. The mysteries surrounding the plot seems also revolve around the purpose and true origins of that tree. Why was it there? What is its power? And how did it came to be are just a few of many questions that the viewers may ask themselves when progressing through this series. There also seems cases of government conspiracies and conflicts between clans with its fellow mages. All of this spells out the word confusion (it sure did for me!) in the first half of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also various flashbacks played throughout the series from the viewpoint of Mahiro related to the case of a main character. She is in fact already dead prior to the series but maintains a strong after-presence with her backgrounds and the mysteries that resulted her death. Plus, there is peach haired princess Hakaze who is crafty, resourceful, and often likes to play mini mind games with the antagonist, and at times with Mahiro and Yoshino. Bored much? Well, probably from being stranded on that island for an extended period of time. In fact, she has her own little secret that gets revealed soon and that itself is a mystery. Nonetheless, the plot twists and various sequences are crafted carefully in order to not go off track and often makes viewers question themselves on what's next. That's where the thriller part comes in. It is thrilling with some of the surprises but at other times, just cliched or even predictable. However, it should be no surprise that Mahiro clearly wants revenge expressed by the look of his face each time his past is reminded. He wants vengeance for his tragic past and he'll stop at nothing to achieve it. Mahiro desire for revenge spells out his determination and what he wants. Yet, there's a point to be said here. Even if he achieves his goal of revenge, the past won't change. The dead don't just get back and walk again.\\n\\n\r\nThe series maintains a small cast of characters rather than a whole all-star ensemble. The two main male protagonists, Mahiro and Yoshino seems to resemble a reflection of William Shakespeare's famous works, Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet respectively. If we look at it carefully, Mahiro seeks revenge for his tragic past similar to Prince Halmet from the play. Mahiro struggles to avenge the death of his family while at times becomes irrational in the way of him doing things. On the other hand, there's Yoshino who seems to allude the character Romeo. In Shakespeare's famous play, Romeo and Juliet, Romeo loses someone they hold dear to their heart. The result of that loss becomes a tragedy in what seems to be a forbidden love story from his work. Behind the scenes of all this drama is the girl Aika who despite her lack of a physical  presence in the series seems to influence it more than anything. Although she doesn't technically make a physical appearance in the show in its present storyline, viewers can clearly see that she is a special individual to both the main protagonists. As a matter of fact, even Hakaze is curious about her (despite not seemingly know who she is) after being acquainted with the main protagonists. From my viewpoint, Aika seems to represent a girl with a mysterious personality with a manipulative state of mind. \\n\\n\r\nThe antagonist of the series, Samon also has a mysterious way of doing his things. In particular, he seeks out the Tree of Exodus with his clan but at the same time seems to want to prevent the destruction of the world with his own ideologies. Behind that suit also seems to lie an insecure individual even with the protection of one of the most elite of those mages from the series. \\n\\n\r\nAs being action, fantasy, and shounen all at once, expect some action throughout the series. The way is presented is in a magical way that although lacks strategy focuses more on morality even doing the occasional dialogues between the fight scenes. However, this doesn't last too long. The fight scenes are significantly toned down later on and hell, even eradicated later on from the show. It goes from action packed to lengthy dialogue that almost seems like reading a textbook. The certain shift of sequences from saving the world to speeches toned me off a bit especially when one moment, there seems to be cool action with an apocalyptic presentation. Then, the next moment it shifts to long dragged out speeches about morality, identity, and more mysteries. The speeches themselves seems to be a bit confusing and not surprisingly enough has Mahiro voice his desire to take revenge AGAIN. The way the characters speak in some of the later dialogues also seems repetitive and digs a bigger hole to the mystery itself with more and more bizarre revelations. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of artwork, Zetsuen no Tempest has a well crafted image of portraying its various scenes. The art directors makes most of the visuals appealing that gets to the point with the themes of the series. In fact, most of the palates and crafted visuals represents the civilization, the tragic scenes, flashbacks, paradise, etc. The characters' designs are also visually represented well especially Aika who has a sense of beauty in her manipulative ways. The series even attempts some jokes with its visuals such as the snickers bar. There some bits of fan service mainly involving around Hakaze by the way she dresses on the island during wet days. But it's really not too much in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the series has many Shakespearean like rhythm to them. It should not be a surprise though given the themes of the series. Kazuhiro Wakabayashi (Soul Eater, Wolf's Rain, xxxHolic) orchestrates many of the music scores well and develop that sense of mysterious atmosphere in many episodes. In fact, the eerie soundtrack and factors with the dialogues matches well with the rhythms. The opening song, \"Spirit Inspiration\" by Nothing's Carved In Stone from the first half has a strong representation in the sense of what the series may be potential be about. All the main characters as well as some of the supporting characters are presented along with potential conflicts. The first ED song, \u201chappy endings\" is presented by Kana Hanazawa who does quite a nice job with her voice. The song shows many of the more metamorphic images involving the main characters as well as the butterflies as seen throughout many times in the series. She also happens to voice one of the main characters in the series, Aika. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Zetsuen no Tempest represents a modern style mystery with some ancestry blood of William Shakespearean work bought to life. The life of one of the main characters no longer exists and that set off many of the conflicts. The conflicts from this series are quite a twist with the various plot holes and surprises. It can be thrilling even with the dialogues but at times, it can also be a bit bothersome. It's a mysterious series to me and should be considered a watch.",

            "content": "Zetsuen no tempest was one of the anime that had me waiting for each episode. A series I'd probably have seen all together if I hadn't been watching it as it was being aired. And so, this review is after seeing 7 episodes of the series. I might update it if I feel the need to, but as for now, this is my opinion of the series.\r\n----STORY----\r\n\"Yoshino, Why did Aika have to die this way? It's been ten months and they don't have any leads. Nothing left behind.. no witnesses.. They don't even know if the killer was acting alone. The task force hardly doesanything anymore. It's absurd. It makes no sense...\"\\n\r\n\"Then, what will you do about this absurdity? Find her killer and punish them yourself?\"\\n\r\n\"Yeah, that's it... I'll do whatever it takes to have everything make sense again!\"\\n\\n\r\nFollowing his sister's mysterious murder, Fuwa Mahiro sets out to find her killer and avenge her death. Then three years later, he returns to his hometown and chances upon his childhood friend Takigawa Yoshino, who doesn't know what to think when his best friend uses magic to save his life, and starts talking about mages, an ancient magic clan, the princess stranded on a distant island  and a strange phenomenon that can destroy the world. And yet, Yoshina can't help but believe what he's being told.\\n\r\nThe story of this anime is the kind that tends to keep the viewers in the dark. The facts are clearly explained. The magic system is not very complicated, but doesn't seem to be created halfway through either. But it's difficult to understand the characters' intentions. They do become a little clearer as their pasts are revealed. But they're mostly unpredictable. The random Shakespearen quotes add a tinge of drama which goes very well with the story, and they don't feel out of place. I'm not a huge fan of Shakespeare but I do feel like reading a little more of his stuff after watching it.\\n\r\nAnd so, I'll give the story an 8. Not extraordinary, but done quite well. The anime seems to focus more on the characters.\\n\\n\r\n----CHARACTERS----\\n\r\nEven though most of the main characters were introduced very early in the show(the first episode, actually), there is very little known about them. There is a lot of mystery about both Mahiro and Yoshino's relation with Aika(the girl who was murdered), and they both themselves don't really come off as 'friends'. Still, they come to the other's rescue when it matters and seem to get along well, despite their conflicting personalities.\\n\r\nBut the most striking thing is Mahiro and Yoshino both are not the kind of guys you'd imagine saving the world. Being ex-delinquents, they do have some experience with fights, but a one-minded revenge crazed guy and an easy going person who seems okay with everything wouldn't be my choice. In contrast to most protagonists, Yoshino actually enjoys being the hero, and the thought of saving the world he hates, which is quite refreshing. Then there's Aika herself. The little that is revealed about her from the flashbacks did make it clear that she was a woman that knew what she wanted, and didn't let anyone else in on it.\\n\r\nAll in all, it's very engaging knowing more about the characters. 9/10\\n\\n\r\n----ANIMATION AND MUSIC----\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty decent. The fighting scenes and magic effects are nicely done. The expressions also come off well. The present feels vivid but the flashbacks have a distant feel to them. It's easy to immediateley differentiate them(the fact that the flashbacks have Aika aside). And the quality of the animation is the same for all episodes. The music is good and suits the show. And I don't see myself skipping the opening or ending song anytime soon. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: I'm enjoying the anime a lot. The story is neither too fast paced, nor too slow. The show has a lot to offer, so it's definitely worth a shot. It has a dramatic feel to it, but that is also not overdone. The first episode pretty much reflects the style of the entire anime. And it only gets better from there on.",

            "content": "The following review is essentially a salty rambling involving a show no one's watched and a particularly egregious cinema sin: \"quote dropping\".\r\nNothing grinds my gears more than a highly superficial anime that pretentiously throws around Shakespeare quotes with no apparent purpose or meaning. No, it doesn't emphasize the show's dramatic storytelling, nor does it contribute to the themes (or lack thereof) that the show attempts to present. Rather, shows that arbitrarily drop quotes from popular novelists, psychologists, or philosophers (e.g. Psycho-Pass and Perfect Insider) for no other reason than to feign intelligence are simply insulting.\r\nZetsuen no Tempest, a 2012 anime purportedly inspired by Shakespeare's dramas,bases its characters and plot on plays such as The Tempest, Romeo and Juliet, and Hamlet. However, if you take away the frivolous and out-of-context quote dropping, you wouldn't recognize the resemblance. Strip away the superficial \"homage\" entirely and you're left with a trope-heavy and mediocre \"save the world\" plot with some far-fetched fantasy elements.\\n\\n\r\nBear with me for a while as I try to make sense of Zetsuen no Tempest's cluster**** of a plot. It's spoiler-free, and one of the most contrived scenarios I've ever seen in a shonen title.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPlot\\n\\n\r\nFrom what I gather, there's a group of magi attempting to bring about the end of the world through a pandemic that turns everything to metal. In order to do so, they're summoning a giant tree that causes \"fruit\", or giant eye-ball covered things attached to chains, to bear from the ground. These mages have exiled their leader, Hakaze, an omnipotent teenage girl with a God-like command of magic, on a desert island. She was opposed to the group's actions, but one has to beg the question\u2026 How did they manage to capture and imprison their leader if she's shown, on multiple occasions, to overpower them? Hell if I know! In any case, she's somehow managed to establish contact with the outside world, bestowing her powers in talismans that she's spread around Japan. Wait\u2026 If she was able to do this, doesn't that mean she foresaw the betrayal? Isn't there a more effective method of seeking help than throwing magical walkie-talkies across a country? Again, the show doesn't really explain these conveniences. They're plot holes, but extremely contrived ones at that.\\n\\n\r\nBut wait! That's not all of it\u2026 The main plot actually revolves around the mysterious death of the protagonist's sister. The viewer follows our two teenage heroes, Yoshino and Mahiro, as they unravel this conspiracy, while the hectic apocalyptic background attempts to brings it all together. Thankfully, the show isn't as hard to follow as I've made it sound. If anything, the slow build-ups and incessant, heavy-handed expositions make the plot seem completely arbitrary in nature. Moreover, the setting is centered around a post-apocalyptic event, but the way Zetsuen no Tempest mishandles and neglects its impact makes everything seem inconsequential. Half of Japan was wiped out by a magical, unknown epidemic and the parents of the main protagonist were in a city known to be affected by said epidemic? Well, we'll just show a single, 10 second scene of the destruction and be done with it. The action falls under a similar pattern, with the majority of confrontations being entirely mindless and serving no purpose. For example, an entire episode was spent showing the fight between some random henchman with a spear and the main protagonist - almost 20 minutes of senseless fighting without any sort of context. At least the audience can find humour in the fact that the main protagonists constantly used teleportation to fight, but when overpowered, the fight simply ends with the protagonists running away... On foot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the biggest plot hole was the \"Romeo and Juliet\" forbidden romance between Yoshina and Mahiro's sister, Aika. Love at first sight is a rather aggravating occurrence that plagues all of Shakespeare's romantic tragedies, and like many Shakespearean plays, the coupling of Aika and Yoshino was mostly born out of convenience. Despite being Yoshino's motivation for joining the quest to save the world, his entire relationship with Aika and their attraction was largely unexplained. It's understandably difficult to establish or depict a relationship with a dead character, but there really needs to be some substance behind the character's death and their relationship with the living cast if the entire plot is be grounded by it. If the viewer isn't given any reason to care about the show's central characters, why should we give a damn about a conflict that's propelled by them?\\n\\n\r\nOne of the few redeeming aspects of the show was the fact that its protagonists had unclear motivations for \"playing the hero\". Their relationship with each other isn't really expanded beyond \"childhood friends, one delinquent and his well-reasoned buddy that tries to set him straight\". However, it's interesting to speculate as to why they're trying to save the world (beyond the obvious justification of their inevitable destruction). Neither protagonist, Yoshino or Mahiro, seems to have a particular attachment to the world they're trying to save, but they can't be accurately characterized as \"nihilistic\". Every aspect about the characters beyond this feature, however, was largely uninspired. Mahiro's characterization is as flat as revenged-crazed siblings come, but Yoshino was particularly disappointing in that he's introduced and constantly remarked as a sly, manipulative person. Despite all of this exposition, he never appears to be anything more than a well-intentioned, level-headed character for more or less the entirety of the series. Zetsuen no Tempest is a frustrating case where the show continuously tells the viewers about its characters rather than building characterization through the plot and context. In fact, almost all of the character traits revealed throughout the show were given through observations by other characters - Hakaze is revealed to be powerful only through the praise of her followers, Yoshino is supposedly manipulative because Aika introduced him as such, and Mahiro's brashness comes from all of the characters frequently calling him out on it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is passable, but not spectacular by any means. Zetsuen no Tempest does get kudos, however, for a successful depiction of post-apocalyptic environments. The colour palettes were dark and earthy, with most of its settings lying somewhere on the grey scale. Similar to the manga, the pseudo-bishonen/bishoujo design is somewhat hit-or-miss and prevalent on each and every character. Every male character has an overly exaggerated hair style and colour, but it isn't overly bothersome. What is bothersome, however, is the repeated use of certain scenes. Practically every episode reminds viewers of the overarching \"ritual\" plot by showing the same scene of robed, chanting figures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nIn the sound department, Zetsuen no Tempest mostly relies on dramatic, classical pieces. Befitting, but hardly memorable.The first OP stands out though, being an English rock song sung by an entirely Japanese band. If there's one thing about the show that I can wholeheartedly recommend, it'd be the music of Nothing's Carved in Stone's.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nI can't really recommend this show to anyone, despite the fact that it's being praised as one of the best mystery/thrillers to recently air. Hell, I could hardly find any reason to finish this show myself. If you're looking for something thoughtful, then I highly suggest you give this show a pass. There really isn't any \"heavy-dialogue\" in a good sense, except the frequent info dumps that result from a really contrived (and ultimately unsuccessful) plot. All in all, Zetsuen no Tempest is a highly mediocre shonen title, with enough inconsistencies and missteps to make any informed viewer scratch their head with frustration.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hey there\r\nSo this is my first review of any anime but I wrote reviews about manga before. Anyways, don't be harsh xD\r\nThe first thing that caught my attention for this anime was how its wallpaper looked like. It was just an advertisement when I was watching some other anime, and I was like..hmm, this looks interesting. I didn't have the slightest clue about what it is, neither that it was a new anime or its genres. I just decided to watch it cause I was bored and the genres were my favorites. So I watched the first episode and it did not disappoint me. Wellto be honest I didn't like it that much when it began. It made absolutely no sense to me. There was just some random things happening that had no connections to each other and it didn't make sense at all. But at the end, they all connected to each other and you wanna know more and what's gonna happen next. Things that made no sense alone, now make sense with each other. I only watched the first three episodes that's already out, but the story seems promising and it's gonna be on my list to follow up.\\n\r\nAlthough there's a bad point to it, that it's not that unique. As I was watching the anime a lot of other anime came across my mind. But oh well, you can't always expect a perfect anime :D\\n\r\n>Story: 9\\n\\n\r\nI can't say there's anything special about the art except for the actions scenes. The characters are normal anime characters that you see in any other anime. I would say they really look alike the characters from durarara and Guilty Crown. Still it is good art. The actions scenes are kinda unique though. Well I never saw any kind of this action in any other anime before, so I guess that's what makes it unique. Unlike many other action anime, in this anime the action scenes are really good animated and it did not disappoint me.\\n\r\n>Art: 8\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the sound. The voice actors do a really good job and can express the feelings well. The background sound is good as well and it puts you in the mood of the anime, you can actually feel mystery, sadness, anger and all the other emotions through the sound. \\n\r\n>Sound: 9\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked the most about this anime is the characters. The characters really attracted me and I wanna know more about them. There's a lot of mystery hidden behind the personality of each character and you think you just see through them in the first glance, but you're wrong cause you don't. How the characters developed in the past few episodes was really good. I'm looking forward to each of their character development.\\n\r\n>Characters: 10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the anime overall. As I said before I only watched it cause I was bored but now I'm hooked. I really want the new episodes to come out. How everything mixes together makes this anime outstanding. \\n\r\n>Enjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of action, mystery and magic, you have to watch this. It's not just silly anime and it has a serious feeling to it. I really liked it so far and hopefully it'll stay this way.\\n\r\nHope this helps. ^__^",

            "content": "This is a story that constantly quotes and references Hamlet and The Tempest, both works of Shakespeare. Some people will love that fact, while others may be a little annoyed. I thought it was done very well, and I really loved the theme and the execution of this series. I have not read the Manga it is based on, but I never expected to love this series going into it. I was pleasantly surprised and it's now one of my favorites. It is a great blend of story, dialogue, action, and it has a great visual and audio presentation.\r\nWhat's it about? The synopsis doesn't reallysay. It's about magic, it's about relationships, it's about the end of the world, and it's about quirky characters that interact with each other in very bizarre ways. It's difficult to describe without throwing spoilers around. Think \"Shakespeare Play\" and you'll get the feel of it right away!\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those beautifully done series as far as artwork and animation goes. It's consistent, it's good quality and it has some wow moments. The music fits well, and it enhances the experience, and the voice acting is done very well. Being filled with so much dialogue, this is an important piece for them to nail and I think they did just that. I loved the package, I loved the execution, and I really think it shines in these elements.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Zetsuen no Tempest were dysfunctional, unexpected, and yet wonderful at the same time. The two main characters were not your stereotypical heroes, in fact their roles in this story were borderline bizarre. This story is based on the emotional involvement of these main characters. They do have their awesome moments early on, but later in the story are not the dominant \"action heroes\" of the tale by any means. The fate of the world revolves around the \"feelings\" of all parties involved, and the two main characters relationship with each other keep the fate of mankind hanging in the balance. It is a character driven story, and the characters are not swarming with stereotypes. I loved that fact about Zetsuen no Tempest, and I think it gives it that little extra something.\\n\\n\r\nNow the story.... I loved the story, though it's filled with plot holes and flawed logic. The flawed logic is going to really bother some people, but the constant reference to the flawed logic of \u201cthe world\u201d really almost pokes fun at the story in general. It\u2019s a little ridiculous while being absolutely wonderful at the same time. The fact is that the flaws are used as storytelling devices, and it's the plot holes and flaws that help tell the story properly. It is a little obvious at times, but it has some nice little twists and surprises that keep it fresh. Best of all it\u2019s told in such a way that it was easy to watch week to week. I looked forward to every episode and the cliffhangers were done very well.\\n\\n\r\nI really loved this series. It was different enough to feel fresh while being absurd and intriguing at the same time. I loved the main characters and I loved how it tried to imitate Shakespeare in its delivery. The fast and quirky dialogue while focusing on the interpersonal relationships made this series special. I highly recommend it!\\n",

            "content": "\u201cThere is more shounen ai in this anime, Horatio, than is dreamt of in your philosophy\u201d - Definitely not Shakespeare\r\nA light hearted review of Blast of Tempest (my first, so suggestions welcome)\r\nBlast of Tempest (Tempest for short) is, for some inexplicable reason, a love letter to two of Shakespeare\u2019s most enduring plays: The Tempest and Hamlet. A strange concept it is indeed, and this anime is, without a doubt, one of the most pretentious I have seen as a result. I admire the writer for being self-absorbed enough to take two classic pieces of literature, and squeeze them into the context of ahigh-schooler mystery action anime. Surprisingly though, it is exactly this confidence that the show exudes that makes the mixture click beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nOur main characters, Fuwa Mahiro and Takigawa Yoshino, are thrust almost immediately into a world where everyone is turning into stone, Mahiro\u2019s found a doll allowing him to speak to Kusaribe Hakaze (a half-naked magician/tsundere stuck on an island) with Yoshino just following along looking generally photogenic. Standard fare then, for a shounen series. The real standout feature for the series presents itself rather abruptly with the fixation on referencing Shakespeare, particularly when Fuwa Aika (Mahiro\u2019s recently murdered sister) enters the stage. The story and characters aren\u2019t just inspired by Shakespeare, they\u2019re going to make sure you know the sole reason they have for their existence is to be going around quoting Shakespeare. \\n\\n\r\nSo it is unsurprising, given the plays this anime is inspired by, that this is a tale of revenge primarily for both the main characters. For Mahiro, it is a chance to use his newfound magic capabilities thanks to Hakaze in order to track down his sister\u2019s killer (for whom he has a very obvious, entirely unrequited, love). Yoshino meanwhile is determined to gain peace of mind for the death of Aika, who until her death was secretly dating Yoshino under her brother\u2019s nose. Yoshino tries to make it seem that he tags along however so as not to see the killer punished by Mahiro, to uphold his position as our inevitable token idealistic anime character (in the very best of ways though). \\n\\n\r\nAnyone familiar with the stories of The Tempest or Hamlet will quickly notice the similarities between Blast of Tempest\u2019s two main characters and the protagonists of The Tempest and Hamlet. Mahiro in his hell-bent devotion to revenge, calls Hamlet to mind, whereas in his more optimistic but rational moments, Yoshino is a transparent reference to The Tempest\u2019s Prospero. While not necessary, as the anime does a reasonable job of explaining to the audience the overall themes behind The Tempest and Hamlet, anyone with even a passing knowledge of the stories and in particular the characters of both these Shakespeare plays will no doubt leaving the anime more satisfied. The ties to Shakespeare the story and characters the anime holds become more and more elegant as it progresses, and are certainly one of the most enjoyable features of the anime. That is, if you can handle the sacrilege that is an anime so arrogantly ripping of the works of the one true playwright (note: sarcasm)\\n\\n\r\nSecondary characters in the show are largely passable, especially after the change in personality much of the characters have in the second half of the anime, which adopts a far more shounen tone than its first half. What you make of this is very much dependent on your overall opinion of typical shounen anime. If anyone had to animate this show though, I am glad it was studio Bones; the light-dark tones of the second half of Tempest are reminiscent of the comedy tones Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood had going for it when it wasn\u2019t being a horribly dark I see you\u2019ve just turned that poor girl into a monster you heartless bastards sort of show. \\n\\n\r\nBlast of Tempest\u2019s animation is what I would expect coming from Bones, not up there but definitely pleasant to the eye. I think Bones knew however that they wouldn\u2019t need exquisitely animated backgrounds, because it surely isn\u2019t just me who can\u2019t get over those character designs? The power of photogenicity is definitely strong in these ones. And respect to Bones for making a show where some of the characters do occasionally find themselves wearing different clothing. If you\u2019re not a fan of shounen ai, stay very much clear \u2013 this show is like the gateway drug to watching Free! - Iwatobi Swim Club.\\n\\n\r\nThe music as well ranks very highly for this show \u2013 particular props to Fuwa Aika\u2019s seiyuu, Hanazawa Kana (also known for Kuroneko in OreImo and Mayuri in Steins;Gate), who apart from playing the ultimate ice queen as Aika, can lay claim to one of the more pleasant ending songs I have listened to. Spirit Inspiration, the first op, is great fun as well, if utterly, entirely devoid of actual meaning. Wholly deserving of my best use of engrish 2013 award.\\n\\n\r\nBones no doubt took a bit of a gamble with this show \u2013 the story is so far up its own behind it probably put many people off without giving it time to settle down and, worse still, it isn\u2019t set in a high school. I am so glad however that they did. This 25 episode anime has an incredibly satisfying sense of progression, taking time to slow itself down before each crescendo, with the first half in particular being one of my favourite arcs in anime. If logic and rational progression in a shounen story aren\u2019t your thing, you will probably leave Blast of Tempest feeling underwhelmed, as my favourite episodes of the series, episodes 9-12, are spent almost entirely stationary by the main characters, engaging in a good old fashioned debate. However, if you appreciate more logical progression in a storyline with a good sense of pacing, and less fanservice-based, more intelligently designed characters, you should definitely give Blast of Tempest a look. If the entire concept sounds mad but cool to you, that\u2019s exactly what it is, and it\u2019s brilliant for it.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation: Psycho Pass for a similarly pretentious and yet oddly satisfying storyline, filled with photogenic characters galore (and a penchant for quoting various well-known authors). Funnily enough, the band responsible for Tempest\u2019s first op also has a (rather good) op in Psycho Pass. Note that Psycho Pass is a work of Gen Urobuchi, so by definition almost is darker than FMA and Blast of Tempest combined, with room to spare for a Madoka Magica sequel. \\n",

            "content": "There's this common expression: \"all bark and no bite.\" Blast of Tempest is a dog that barks Shakespeare quotes aimlessly, holding little weight and consequence out of the context of its wholesome product. It's like how there's so much Zelda paraphernalia that gradually obfuscates from the point of what the iconic series was in the first place - a large game franchise with a grand mythos of diverse interconnecting core stories and subplots. Blast of Tempest puts up a facade of intelligence and substance by spouting Shakespeare when there's hardly any actual story content to speak of it. Well then, I'll move on to thecore of the review that I have something to talk about, unlike this very series itself.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Okay, let's start this on a positive note before I start slamming this series for its lack-of-\"Story\"; the initial episodes have promise at least. We have the Romeo expy Yoshino standing at his girlfriend's grave when a mysterious woman by the name of Evangeline appears asking about the whereabouts of his old friend Mahiro, the Hamlet expy. Mahiro encounters Evangeline and things get hectic. It turns out Mahiro has connections to this missing woman named Hakaze who is a mage trapped on some far off island and she wants to stop her brother Samon from reviving a magical tree that threatens the planet. Mahiro fends off Evangeline with the various magical talismans Hakaze left across the area. Meanwhile giant seeds of the Tree of Exodus Samon is trying to revive are sprouting over the city and petrifying anyone who isn't protected by a talisman. Evangeline suspects it's Hakaze's doing because Mahiro is seen actively using Hakaze's magic himself. Mahiro communicates with Hakaze via this magic idol, and Mahiro is assisting Hakaze on the condition that she finds his sister's murderer, and unbeknownst to Mahiro, his dead sister was Yoshino's girlfriend in secret. Some of Samon's assistants are thrown into the conflict to ensure things go smoothly with Exodus' resurrection, and Yoshino teams up with Mahiro to get him out of the bind and to also find out who killed his lover Aika. The first 3 episodes have lots of action and intrigue, with various sides clashing, a catastrophic plan unfolding and a decent dose of angst...but then it doesn't know where to go from there, almost literally I might add. Mahiro and Yoshino travel around every 2 episodes or so, but since nothing's going on in the present, they just settle in one spot shortly after and show flashbacks of Yoshino, Mahiro and Aika and then one boring fight scene in an aquarium and Yoshino being captured for a short period thrown to mix it up a bit. Once episode 8 comes, things get even thinner; we have not one, not two, but FOUR episodes of a long winded sophistry battle between Yoshino, Mahiro and Samon trying to prove Hakaze still being alive (which was earlier suspected to be all a weird contradiction) involving duplicates, time rifts and other stuff, and the arguments go back and forth with neither party having much evidence or going to much length to argue their stance while the government tries to attack the Tree of Exodus. When the half point hits, the world is stricken by calamity, but there's no driving conflict or urgency in the second cour, so the characters--which, mind you, all villains reconcile with the allies at this point--just meander around and occasionally blow up a tree or two every now and then, because again, nothing is going on. After blowing up enough trees (yeah, take that environment!), the plot starts to head towards some semblance of a conclusion, but not before we find out who Aika's killer is, which happens to be one of the most ludicrous and groan-worthy twists I've ever seen, and it's all uncovered thanks to the magic of a crappy time travel element to put the crap icing on the garbage cake. The remaining events unfold without many bumps in the road, wrapping up in a totally run of the mill happy ending just to nip it in the bud. That's pretty much it. The story is about as thin as a nickel and is littered with many problems, but it has the occasional saving grace like the first 3 episodes, the conflict with society and the media on blowing up the trees fearing worse than the already poor conditions, and a delightfully liberating and refreshing scene where the one sane and logical side character beats the crap out of our far gone angst-ridden protagonists. That's all more than enough to save it from being one of the worst things ever, but it is still a big waste of time. I love Shirodaira's most prolific work, Spiral, so I had some expectations going in, and suffice to say I was massively disappointed, such a shame.\\n\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Oh goody, the characters. I'll be fair and say that for the most part they started off tolerable in the first cour before the even more dreadful second, but there's still nothing exemplary from most of them, and the second cour does some hefty damage to them. Yoshino is the lovelorn Romeo character who goes from being more proactive and level headed to whiney and self-loathing, Mahiro is the cynical and sharp-tongued Hamlet who goes from a driven avenger to an egotistical bully and Aika is the sadistic princess who played around with both of them. Hakaze turns from a confident and spunky lass to a nagging waifu trying to pine for Yoshino. Evangeline is something of an aggressive Misato-esque warrior woman who stays fairly consistent but is less prominent in the latter half while her assistant Takumi is pretty much just along for the ride. Hakaze's big bro Samon gets some of the worst of it, turning from a stern and headstrong antagonist to...comic relief with a straight face. His right hand brawn, Natsumura, is a ruthless stoic, but he doesn't have much of a hand in the second half, but Tetsuma the brains and voice for Samon has it worse, becoming nothing more than a cab driver for everyone else. Now, the one who is straight up the worst character of the lot the entire time...Junichiro. The lawful neutral who fulfills only that much, just wandering around being neutral; if he ever gets involved, he beats up members of both parties, of which, the fights are omitted to be left to the imagination, making it more dreadful than it already is. He is an absolutely pointless character, and the only time he ever did something with some effect to it is when he tried to share certain plot details which obfuscate details and make things more mysterious. Thankfully though, I'll close things off with the one character who DOES stand out as a good character - better than the series does justice to, which is Hanemura. He starts out as a bit of a spineless but sincere and rational guy who learns to fight under Mahiro's tutelage and gradually becoming more outspoken and vigorous after going through all the physical duress of Mahiro's training and emotional turmoil of all the other characters angsting and complaining around him, leading to the powerful scene of him kicking Mahiro and Yoshino's asses when things get out of hand. He's a stand up guy and he sets things straight when the plot is wrought with too much self-indulgence, anguish and melodrama, making him a refreshing change, ironically he is introduced in the second cour when all else goes to crap, so that in itself is a plus. At the end of the day, Hanemura breaks the series out of its conceited shell, but when leveled with the general character decay and initial merely decent characterization plus Junichirou, I can't give the roster a pass.\\n\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: Blast of Tempest being animated by Bones is a good sign. The very same company known for works such as both Fullmetal Alchemist adaptations, Wolf's Rain, RahXephon and many more nice looking series, and Blast of Tempest upholds some degree of that quality in its appearance. The characters are almost never off model, everything is smoothly rendered, clean and sharp looking and can pull off some more dynamic action scenes well, but those scenes are rather few and far between, and there's still much better out there, so it isn't THAT remarkable. The artwork looks really nice too thankfully, capturing the look of the manga well, with the designs being very sharp to begin with so the series looks cool at the very least. \\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The score is a rather enticing collection of melancholic orchestral pieces with bits of whimsy, mystery, grandiose and tragedy to them. There also happens to be select Beethoven pieces bundled in, so you know there's quality classical pieces to be had in this series, so that music happens to be the strongest department for this anime. The voice work on the other hand, is about average; characters come off as one note a lot of the time and lack a bit of enthusiasm at times, but the voices fit the characters well and performances are still consistent and serviceable. \\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: For me, enjoyment tends to run concurrent with story, and even if an anime may come off as \"boring\" in terms of tone and atmosphere to some, if there is some weighty metatheming or elaborate writing and intrigue permeating over the course of things, I won't get bored personally. However, as my story section dictates, there was hardly anything worthwhile for me to chew on. If Blast of Tempest were a steak, it would be a bland, dry and tough to chew on one. I was bored watching it most of the time because things always meandered and there wasn't much intellectual meat to it, and a lot of it was far below average. Blast of Tempest was just a really stale journey. \\n\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nIn closing, Blast of Tempest is one of those series that falls into-nay, EPITOMIZES the cliche of a lot of anime out there: interesting concept, poor execution (in this case, hardly any). It's one of the most sloggish and inflated series I've ever seen that clings to its premise like a pure catholic teen clings to his/her chastity. The series had a cool idea that was rather intriguing, but it didn't know how to expand on it, so they just run around haphazardly with it and start randomly expounding Shakespeare references to try and uphold the air of assured direction when they haven't a clue what they are doing. \"Okay, so I've hooked them with the premise and I gotta make a series with this, but I have no idea what to do next...GOT IT! I'll have the characters quote Shakespeare because HE'S intelligent, so that will make them think THIS SERIES is still intelligent! Perfect!\" Blast of Tempest is a stretched out, pretentious (I try to use this word sparingly) and unexciting odyssey (if you can even call it that) and it is not worth your time. Don't be fooled by the Shakespeare references, this series is hardly smart at all, don't waste your time on it. Do yourself a favour and just read Spiral by the same author, it's a mystery that's worth it, Shirodaira just dropped the ball here.",

            "content": "This is one of the best psychological anime that I have ever seen till now (Might change in the future if I stumble upon another anime which is even greater than this). Let\u2019s find out why is it the best psychological anime, Shall we?\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThis was just wonderfully written and done. It was simply epic. I don\u2019t marathon a anime in a single day but Zetsuen no Tempest made me marathon it in just a day. This was an anime which I shall call the mother of all plot twists. You will think exactly the opposite of what will happen *no let me correct that*No you are actually made to think the opposite of exactly what will happen. I still wonder how this isn't in the top 100. This should be rated even higher than it\u2019 current ran of 277th. I did not expect disappointment when I picked this show and it didn't give me disappointment either. All the questions we have near the end of the anime are answered (Well that was for me though). The story was at a really good pace and even leaving a few hours for some work will make you want to watch the next episode and find out what is going on. It\u2019s that kind of feeling I had.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNow this was another brilliant part of the anime. The 2 OP as well as the 2 ED will not disappoint you (ED 1 made me sleepy actually). The OP 1 was completely sung in English by Nothing\u2019s Craved in stone, yes you heard me right. It\u2019s a full English OP and not a semi one and it was damn good to listen to. They have also sung OP 2 of Psycho Pass too. The OST were pretty well done and a few were done by the people in Key and the OST just fit in with the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThey weren't uninteresting nor interesting, they were just good and they did their roles well. The 2 male MC were just brilliant (in terms of having brains.) They both were intelligent but they both had their own separate ways in dealing with the same problem. We were also shown of a few side characters past or we were more exposed to them = learning who and how they are. So it didn't suck there. We were introduced to a lot of characters but the main side characters behaviours and how they truly are were shown which is supposed to be important in all anime. We also had a few plot twists in the characters itself too.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain this was good. There were some parts where it did go downhill for a few secs but they were ok for me as the story is more important to me. The CG were pretty good too. The CG didn't even feel like it was Different. The OP2 introduced to us the new characters and it was enjoyable looking at it. Well there was not much here for me\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it pretty well. There were few episodes of enjoyment + it did keep me entertained the entire anime. So if you think this is all a serious anime then you are wrong. There of course need to be fun time too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A Really good psychological + supernatural anime I would recommend to watch\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 8.8\\n\\n\r\nPersonal note: These are entirely my opinions and you don\u2019t have to agree or disagree with me.",

            "content": "The first episode of this series was most impressive.  To be fair, it blew me away.  First the artwork - it set the tone for the anime.  It wasn't cutesy or cartoonish at all (nothing wrong with that) but showed a kind of muted realism, both in the characters' drawing and the scenery.  It elevated the anime in some ways.  Also the almost understated tension in the first episode showed something I'd not seen before.  So I was very much interested to watch on.\r\nThe premise of the whole story was also fascinating.  As well as having magic, amurder mystery, and some bizarre butterflies and floating eyeball fruit, this anime, for me, was set apart from the pack.\\n\\n\r\nThe initial set up to the story was intriguing, and the characters had a kind of gritty realism about them.  Combined with a catchy opening sequence, the series showed a hell of a lot of promise.  Promise that ultimately was unfulfilled.  The end left me with unrequited yearning.  Allow me to explain.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to sum up the series in one word it would be \"slow\".  The pace of the anime was just too darned slow.  From memory I could only remember a few occasions where I REALLY wanted to watch on.  And although there were a few minor surprises and twists (none which you wouldn't be able to guess yourself if you're bright enough) the anime just did not seem to have the pace that it promised from the first episode.  Much of the series was taken up by somewhat pointless dialogue which kind of droned on.  I kept asking myself when something would happen, then the episode would end and I was left with a feeling of \"what the...?\"\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say there aren't some good elements to the anime.  I thought the music used was very atmospheric, appropriate and really added tension to the dramatic aspects.  The art was also superb, it was really something, and for the most part I enjoyed watching it for that aspect.\\n\\n\r\nBut having finished I couldn't shake the niggling feeling there was something essential lacking.  It's hard to put one's finger on it.  The artwork was great, the music fantastic, the characters original and unique...  But Zetsuen no Tempest was ultimately unable to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly the characters.  The first half of the series was difficult to watch because there were no protagonists who the viewer could identify with or even like, except for a mage who is stuck on a deserted island in the middle of nowhere and can only communicate through a wooden doll.  Mahiro is not a likeable hero, and does not seem to pretend to be one either.  So we follow his angry, selfish motives for vengeance as he tries to find the killer of his sister.  And on the flip side of the coin we have Yoshino, who is nebulous at best.  He barely reacts to anything, and it's hard to drum up any feeling for this deadpan character.  Even at the end I wasn't sure if I liked him or not.  I suppose I would say I didn't really care.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the series was also somewhat disappointing.  All the potential conflicts and plot lines are too conveniently tied up, and they don't really go anywhere.  It was disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nThe constant references to Shakespeare were interesting... sort of.  The characters have this thing where they start spurting random quotes form the Tempest and Hamlet.  Others have said this is a strength of the anime, but personally I'm not so sure.  It appears forced initially and out of place.  Even I can start spouting Shakespeare if I wanted: \"When we are born we cry that we are come to this great stage of fools\"... but I'm not sure why I would do it ...  At the end they tie in the two Shakespearean references somewhat nicely, so I guess it wasn't all bad.\\n\\n\r\nI'd give it a go if you like slow paced character driven anime.  Being a fan of fantasy genres in general, I wouldn't have high hopes for that aspect of the story as the mages' \"powers\" are kind of limited and in the end don't really mean much or add anything to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nOverall: 6",

            "content": "Before getting into the review, let me say that, Zetsuen no Tempest is heavily linked with the works of William Shakespeare. The Tempest and Hamlet are the two pieces used and having some prior knowledge on these two texts does help fully appreciate Zetsuen no Tempest. If you have an indepth understanding of both of the plays you'll be able to notice the similarities and predict some scenarios beforehand. However, the anime does a good job of not making it a prerequisite and thus the general audience will be able to follow. Simply put, the major difference between the two is that; Hamlet is atragedy while The Tempest ends happily. There are many references of the two pieces, while the plot and characters are heavily influenced from both The Tempest and Hamlet. \\n\\n\r\nThe first episode sets the up the plot and wastes no time in getting into the action. From the episode, it's evident that there are two main complications. The first is of the death of Aika Fuwa (Mahrio's sister), and Mahiro is trying to hunt the killer himself. The second key plot is about the Kurasibe Clan. Hazkaze (female lead) is stranded on an island, because Samon (Kurasibe Clan leader) wants to awaken the Tree of Exodous. Simply put, there is the possibility of an apocalyptic-type destruction to occur if the tree is awoken from its slumber. The two stories approach closer and closer, as the series progresses only to tangle into one bigger picture.\\n\\n\r\nZetusen no Tempest does a good job of making it appear more complicated than it really is. The basic plot is covered with mystery and psychological elements which are used to disrupt the predictability. New aspects are continuously added to create unexpected moments and attempt to confuse the audience. \\n\\n\r\nZetsuen no Tempest has a lead dual protagonist, of equal position, which is pretty rare and difficult to pull off. However it manages to do it exceptionally well and thus characters Mahiro and Yoshino are appealing. Mahiro started off as someone who was blinded for revenge, but only to become more mature and calm than at first. Yoshino appears as an innocent bystander, but as the story progresses, the perception of his character changes. They give mutual assurance to each other as arise, which helps advance the story. Their relationship starts as friends, with some background to it, but changes overtime. Bonds are tested by issues and complications arise which can only deepen or break friendships.\\n\\n\r\nHakaze Kusaribe is a sorceress and the strongest one in history. Hakaze isn't as central as the duo but still went through some growth and change. Her selflessness was the most evident part of her personality, and thus it goes through the biggest development. She is the strongest magic user and thus becomes an invaluable person in most of the situations in combat. Her relationship with the other characters can only grow after being in isolation for so long, and she begins emotions she hasn't felt before. \\n\\n\r\nSecondary characters weren't as influential but they were important to the initial advancement of the story. They each had a role to create a complication, helping the main characters mature. They played apart in conversations and various narrations. But towards the second half, they began to lose their purpose as the main plot was becoming uncovered. Their roles started declining and becoming almost generic, like a backdrop to the scenes.  \\n\\n\r\nThe latter half of the series lacked what made the first half so special. In the first half , the predictability was never there because the characters were indefinite. They still weren't fully matured and thus could do the unexpected by, having a change of heart. The plot was also purposely undeveloped but flexible allowing it to potentially stray off into any direction. In the second half, the general plot was revealed and thus it loses its charm of secrecy. However, it does a solid job of maintaining the major mystery of Aika's death until the very end. Zetsuen no Tempest had the choice of either ending as The Tempest or Hamlet. Though I won't say how it ends, the one it does choose is rather forcible.\\n\\n\r\nThe use of magic brings a supernatural theme, but takes away some of its realism. And thankfully it did not go over the top with the use of magic. Its primary uses were for combat, destruction and for some odd bits and pieces. It wasn't a major part of the anime, but instead adds another dimension of possibilities to the already flexible plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe depressed atmosphere goes well with the world ending theme. There was little action in general but for the small pieces of combat were animated nicely. The fighting scene act as a change of pace from the rest of the anime. There was a good amount of it, never too much or too little. The art-style looked good and consistent throughout. While the character models depicted the personalities of the characters. The soundtrack worked well and only enhanced the mood.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end the anime handled itself well and its ending that ties up the ends. The series as a whole, balances all the components, and has an excellent cast of characters. Although the first half is noticeably better than the second and attempts to force a specific ending, but no doubt it was worth the watch.",

            "content": "My favorite anime this season, really interesting story that pays homage to Shakespeare's Hamlet and The Tempest while integrating its own original storyline and unique characters.\r\nZetsunen no Tempest, a story of revenge and tragedy. Referencing Shakespeare's Hamlet, the story portrayed can lead to tragic end of revenge where sadness is reflected with more sadness. However, there is also The Tempest, the alternative end to a story of revenge. An ending where all is forgiven and sadness is repaid with forgiveness and happiness.\r\nStory:\r\nAmazing plot, the story of revenge leads the audience to decide whether the ending should be one of tragedy or happy ending. Loved howZetsuen no Tempest tells a story of magic and mythology, at the same time giving the possibility that what seems like magic and gods could merely be science at a level above one's comprehension. The story involves a lot of psychology theme which is a favorite of mine. Questioning just how one should response to loss of loved one, by either responding with desire for revenge or to continue living a normal life. Honestly this story deserves a higher rating than 8, a majority of top animes with high ratings are romance comedy. This story is interesting! It helps question what it means to be human, whether being logical all the time is appropriate or to express those emotions we humans were given to show. Using the words from Hamlet and The Tempest, truly made the story more elegant and beautiful. Showing that humans not only desire a meaningful life, but a meaningful death. Not to mention Zetsuen no Tempest help question whether lifes' coincidences are just coincidences or do they tie to pre destined state of events in life.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nEnjoyed the art definitely, characters were well design. Loved how Aika's death was shown to be mysterious, beautiful and meaningful when given reason for her death but also cold and tragic without understanding what was the point of her death. Mahiro's character art was well drawn as well, his appearance gave off a rebellious leader aura that was recklessly yet rational. Yoshino's character art was also well suited for his character and personality, looking somewhat regular like character but hiding a calculative intelligent persona that at times lack delicacy due to experience.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe classical use of music helped produced the atmosphere really well. Music being classical really help Zetsuen no Tempest relate to Shakespeare's Hamlet and the Tempest even most so. Not much to say otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nLoved all the characters, especially Aika for being the mastermind behind our 2 protagonists' journey for revenge and truth. Aika (also voiced by my favorite seiyuu) was my favourite, her personality being a little bit of everything. Strong and cold by being able to make the decision of her death all on her own, playing an act in front of Mahiro with Yoshino to keep their relationship a secret. Yet having a soft, warm and playful side to her that is somewhat childish at times. During times with her and just Yoshino or arguing with Mahiro because neither were afraid of her but rather felt the need to protect her frail looking appearance. Yoshino was my favourite character for first half of the story, being able to calmly make decisions and act out of rationality, adapting when necessary. Being perfect yet imperfect was what made him interesting. Since Aika mentioned that Yoshino is able to be calm and act rational at all times is because he goes with the flow adapting when necessary, able to be everything appropriate but unable to be individual. Mahiro wasn't much of a favorite character but likable nevertheless. A typical rebellious cold and cool character, reckless yet has good rational than most rebellious characters would. Hakaze being the opposite half of Aika was good to have. A sheltered princess unknowing to common sense, having an outward tough exterior but is actual frail on the inside being the maiden she is. Complete opposite of Aika who was frail in appearance but strong willed in personality, complementing each other's character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nProbably one of my new top favorites indefinitely, since its rare to have good tragedy stories. Not to mention a tragedy story with a good turn around. Plus despite the continuous bombardment of tragic plot events, it had some slight comedic relief time to time to help keep the story from being depressing. One of my favorite reasons that I enjoyed this story was that it was not 2 protagonist with special traits or abilities, but rather 2 ordinary high school students at a unique place at a unique time, making it very adaptive to the idea that no matter how normal the life you live is. You are your own protagonist in your own story. An enjoyable story of what may seem like predetermined act with actors following a script, but it is the actor's will to carry out those lines.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The first half of the anime was theatrical, morose and stylish (yellow butterflies, humans turned into metal statues, faintly Lovecraftian environmental apocalypse, Kabbalism and Shakespeare go surprisingly well together). It had a certain charm, even if the characters talked their mouths off and the action moved a bit slowly.\r\nThen the second half completely changed the tone. Everything started revolving around Hakaze's juvenile, banal crush on Yoshino. The fate of the world and the revenge plot took second stage to the riveting sight of Hakaze going kyaa and smashing her breasts against Yoshino's arm every two minutes. Quality storytelling, that. -_-\r\nSo if you don't mind aninteresting premise turning halfway through into a run of the mill romantic comedy about the relationship angst of a hormonal teenager, you can watch this. Otherwise give Zetsuen a wide berth.",

            "content": "Zetsuen No Tempest is one of those series that you'll come across accidentally, instead of getting it recommended from an anime-loving friend, and after finishing it, you'll be scratching your head, wondering why it isn't higher up in the rankings. But what makes it so good? Let's find out, shall we?\r\nStory:\r\nAt first, the story may seem like a typical shonen; the two main characters are trying to save the world, with the help of a stranger, from a seemingly evil group (and a tree!). However, as you progress through the series, you'll start realizing there's a lot more than to what meets the eye. Thestory becomes a roller-coaster ride midway and until the end, you'll be on the edge of the seat, captivated by the flow of the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the weakest point of the series. Although it's not horrible, the art is not exceptional either, and the animation does no justice to the series, with regular animation errors that you can't help but face-palm at. Try not to be too hung up on the errors, or it might be make the experience a bit more unpleasant.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe music is pretty decent, in my opinion. The first opening, Spirit Inspiration, is a fun ride (although its lyrics make no sense), and he two endings are a pleasant experience. The background music is also well done, with each piece setting the mood properly, if not perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly the best part of the series. Each character is different from the other. Most of them, including the supporting protagonists, have character developments which range from good to amazing. The dialogues are the highest points of the show, with frequent references to Shakespearean plays  like Hamlet and The Tempest which are used to great effect.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I was pretty skeptical of the show at first. Little did I know though, it would be one hell of a hectic ride that would keep my eyes glued to the screen at all times and prevent me from ever wanting to take a break.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Zetsuen No Tempest is like a sports car you haven't used in a long time: it takes some time to get to its best, but when it does, you won't look back. It's a gem of a series which deserves a lot of recognition, and I can safely say it is one of the finest anime I've seen in my life.",

            "content": "Would you obliterate this world for the sake of someone you love? Would you go against the logic of the world to achieve your goals?\r\nZetsuen No Tempest  is a masterly written piece of work that challenges the watcher to reflect on their ideas of death, love, and logic. I started this anime with low expectations. I am a rather optimistic person, and the premise of a dystopic world did not attract much enthusiasm from me. Zestuen No Tempest, however, is not just a story of some parallel dystopian world, but rather a personal story involving love and tragedy. \r\nStory\r\nZNT prides itself in their storytelling. Yes, there are numerous action scenes to gratify our blood-thirsty anime watching peers but these are not the most impressive features of the anime. The splendidity is established in the plot and dialog. ZNT did a great job with dialog.  The initial proposition of the anime were not striking. You have a world where there is a special clan, called the Kusaribe, that can manipulate technology to use their power, which they call magic. It seems like this \u201cmagic\u201d comes from a tree, and the magic can only be used to enforce the world's logic. Nothing mind blowing.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is less about magic but rather the peculiar circumstances of the two main characters, Fuwa Mahiro and Takigawa Yoshino. These two characters are both thrown into this surreal world of magic after the murder of their beloved, Fuwa Aika. Mahiro is bent on avenging his little sister, while Yoshino is struggling to find inner peace with this news. These two personalities are the driving force of the plot. \\n\\n\r\nI think Yoshino and Mahiro had a terrific dynamic that kept me in the edge of my seat, at least, during the first half of the anime. Yoshino and Mahiro are supposedly friends, but their relationship are at first pictured ambiguously. Their devious personalities made me suspicious of their real motives, but it is those parts that made the anime so intense and eye grabbing. \\n\\n\r\nThough the anime is rather dark, there are comedic elements that help alleviate some of the darkness that surrounds the story. I am not a fan of \"fan service\" but there were some of it in the anime. It was all nicely placed and didn't interfered with the viewing experience. Some of it was actually nicely appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of this anime was phenomenal. The intensity of those  first few episodes were unprecedented in my experience, and the most surprising part was how they executed it. I will not spill spoilers, but those parts were dialog-driven, and it is spectacular how those scenes captured you into the story and made your mind thrilled at every new twist. \\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the anime was not as intense as the first half, but by no mean was it sub par. The second half just added more to the story. The introduction of a certain anticipated female character was the main event, but there were other factors that made the second half excellent.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give the story 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe scores says it all. Not much to explain.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the second half's opening and closing more than the first half's Op and Ed. Both of them were good.\\n\\n\r\nThe BGM was excellent and fit every scene. It was so unique and theatrical in it's volume and instrument used.  The epicness, the intensity, and the dystopia shown were all equally fitted with superb background music. \\n\\n\r\nWill definitely check out the OST when I get the chance.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned earlier that the plot drives the anime, and while this is true, it is the characters that pushes the plot forward. ZNT did not flesh out every character that were introduced ( there were some characters that we never even got to see at all) but they managed to really fulfill the characters that were the most central to their story. These central characters would be Mahiro, Yoshino, Hazake, and Aika.\\n\\n\r\nMahiro- He was my favorite character of the series. His intellect could not be denied, his will power was impeccable, and his vengeance nothing to play with.  I felt bad for him throughout the anime since it seemed like he was the one in most pain, and I couldn't see a good ending for him emotionally. One that is driven for revenge usually doesn't have the best ending. There was character development and Mahiro did change a bit, though he would deny it. I like seeing his interactions with others, though Mahiro seems like he can do it all, he does have trouble with communication, which gave some good comedic relief on my part. Liked his character design.\\n\\n\r\nYoshino- I have mixed feelings about this character. I mostly like him but I still feel like we didn't really get to delve into who Yoshino really is. I get it. He prides himself in not showing his emotion to anyone, but you would think that we would at least get a glimpse, as us watchers, to his inner attitude towards other characters. Besides that, I really enjoyed this character. He is not your typical MC, he is smart, conscious, and and not afraid to get his hand dirty. He is a complex character, and you always want your MC to be more than one dimensional. Unique character design, but looks like Light Yagami in some angles.\\n\\n\r\nHazake: I did not like her at first, but she grew on me over time. She's smart, but has an annoying attitude. She is extremely arrogant. This makes sense however, since she was raised as a princess, and is the strongest person of the Kusaribe tribe. She grew on me later, because we got to see different sides of her, and it made her more human to me. I grew very fond of her. Typical but fitting character design. She was a bit too short for my opinion. Maybe she has a Napoleon complex......\\n\\n\r\nAika: The mysterious girl that has captured the heart of the two main MCs and thrown logic out of joint. The girl in love with Shakespeare tragedies, and can be seen religiously quoting verses from Hamlet and Tempest. I enjoyed Aika. I think the anime foreshadowed her to be this special and unique character, and I thought they were doing too much with all her flashbacks, but in the end, Aika in full glory was all that I thought she would be. Her witty remarks, her dark humor, her sexual teasing, I loved it all. She certainly deserves all the attention given to her in Zetsuen No Tempest. Pretty Character design, seems to be in contrast to Hazake's design. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nZetsuen No Tempest was a heck of a ride. The first half shined as bright as any anime I have ever seen, and the second half was spectacular in their transition. The theme of the anime about wanting to change the world for someone you love is reiterated and explained throughout the anime. There are numerous quotes from Hamlet and Tempest, and I would be surprised if one is not at least tempted to get into Shakespeare after completing this anime. The enjoyment was out of the roof for me, I initially gave this anime an 9/10...but there was two episode in the second half that boosted the anime to a perfect score. \\n\\n\r\nBut the anime was not perfect, there were some underwhelming parts, but overall, I cannot disregard the tremendous excitement that I felt while watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this to anyone that enjoys a great Ost, drama, love, and battle of wits. \\n\\n\r\nOutstanding (10/10)",

            "content": "Here we have, a superb series that didnt get the spotlight it deseved. The Fall 2012 anime season brought a lot of fan favorite series that would have viewers buzzing so other anime would be dropped. Zetsuen no Tempest was unfortunate, for some, to be part of the latter.\r\nStudio Bones animates another Shonen Gangan manga, but unlike some of their previous adaptions it's not pragmatic and has no gecko ending. Meaning it follows the story all the way through. Some scenes are altered and arranged differently from the original manga but they're arguably improvements. The plot of the anime, even if not original is executedvery well. From episode 5 and onwards there's at least one twist or revelation in every episode and Zetsuen no Tempest does this without getting convoluted. It starts out as a simple story about revnge but expands the plot to a worldly scale. \\n\\n\r\nAs stated earlier the anime is by Studio Bones so it's given high production values in it's art and animation. The character designs are very attractive; the hairstyles and outfits are very detailed and the colors are deep and vibrant, especially in the character's eyes. The CGI also adds to a beautiful experience, most notably in the action scenes and the animation of butterflies.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters meant to be based off those in Shakespeare's works. Mahiro as Prince Hamlet(Hamlet), Yoshino as Romeo Montague(Romeo & Juliet), Hakaze as Prospero(The Tempest), and Aika as Sycorax(The Tempest) and Ophelia(Hamlet). However, due to the plot of the story, the characters' actions differ and they're spared some of the angst found in a Shakespeare play. In fact Yoshino, Aika, Mahiro(and Hakaze later on) are aware of Shakespeare's works and make a point to not \"let this story end in tragedy). Mahiro is a straightforward, almost stereotypically shonen protagonist, main character. He has an unfettered mind consumed by revenge, yet even he has some wits about him. Yoshino, is a \"Beware the nice guy\" type who isnt afraid to turn into a manipulative bastard. Mahiro doesnt care about the world and even he finds Yoshino ruthless. Hakaze, despite her upbringing is spunky and probably gets the most character development in the series. Then there's Aika, the posthumous chracter, who has a huge impact on the plot, and is brig something to look forward to in the flashbacks as she steals scenes. The supporting cast is pretty small so they're given a lot of screen time to be memorable. All in all , this show has good characterization.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is ambitious. It alludes to Shakesperean plays by using deep, orchestral sounds in the episodes.  The first opener is a solid rock song and the second one is more melodic and quite possibly fits the show better based off it's lyrics. As for the ending themes, \"Happy Endings\" and \"Bokutachi no Uta\" may feel out of place but are enjoyable nonetheless. If the sound doesnt interest you the voice acting will. Particulary, Toshiyuki Toyanaga whose playing against his type as Mahiro. Toyanaga delves so deep into the role he uses an unrecognizable voice. Still, the rest of the actors are strong. Kouki Uchiyama gives a heartstring pulling perfomance as Yoshino in episode 18. Meanwhile, Miyuki Sawashiro's Hakaze is very spirited and Kana Hanazawa gives Aika an enchanting voice. Rikiya Koyama delivers Samon's inner thoughts effectively.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is an issue with Zetsuen no Tempest it's episodes 10-12. What was meant to be a showdown comes out as a debate of sorts, and after some impressive fight scenes, the clever dialogue of the show might not appeal to everyone.\\n\\n\r\nEarlier in the review I wrote that some people may have dropped this anime but for the people who stuck with it, they can tell you that the show kept them on the edge of their seats. I would obviously agree. With all the drama, dailogue, and plot of this show waiting for a new episode every week was almost painful. And now that it's over I'm almost going to feel abandoned.\\n\\n\r\nFor all the reasons I put in this review, I'm willing to consider this show a masterpiece. At the risk of sounding like a weaboo I think this is the \"BEST ANIME EVER\" but I know it wont take the #1 spot on MAL because it's got traits that will turn some viewers. Even so, I highly recommend it.",

The story behind it all was very original, and i think its rather hard for some anime now-a-days to do so.

            "content": "Trees destroying the world. Now this is interesting, not.\r\nBlast of Tempest is a show where nothing matters, absolutely nothing. It's simply pretentious BULLSHIT!\r\nIt's got all powerful magic trees that pop out of nowhere, uninteresting and hardly developed characters, quotes from Hamlet for no reason, people just standing there for FIVE EPISODES debating about nonsense (Where the villain even helps his enemy, and later the villain and his enemies for NO REASON all of a sudden become friends), absolutely atrocious pacing that goes from way too fast to way too slow, and more things.\r\nI can't even begin to really describe the story because of how muchof a mess it is (It's almost as messy as BONES' last awful work, Eureka Seven AO), which is the result of the pacing being ridiculously fast in the beginning, and there being absolutely NO COHESION. The events don't flow well together whatsoever. It starts out with something about Mahiro's sister being murdered, a half-naked mage being left on an island to die, and other stuff that later does not matter much.\\n\\n\r\nIt then rushes through everything, and does not even spend time to have you get to know the characters well (And no, the backstory does not count because that backstory did not prove to be relevant enough to the \"plot\"), or have you get to know the setting. How am I supposed to care about anything in this show if they don't even bother to take the time to build up their characters and setting? You can not even really tell what the hell is going on because of how it jumps from event to event in an atrocious way, with there being no cohesion as I've stated earlier. This is really something that shouldn't be that hard to mess up. One of the most important things in a show is pacing, and placing of events. You need to have a story flow well so the viewer knows what is going on, and is getting a good deal of storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nSo come around halfway through the first half of the show, we then have humanity trying to stop a magical tree from destroying the world. All of a sudden the two groups that are fighting each other then engage in a pretentious debate about time travel, the murder, and other crap for no reason. It seems like this stuff matters, but in the end it doesn't because after FIVE EPISODES of this crap with them just standing there, debating, another tree pops up, and saves the world, so their debate DIDN'T EVEN MATTER! Yeah, let's debate and let a tree interrupt our pointless conversation. Oh and apparently that magic tree ends up dictating everything humanity does, stops crime and other stuff, but we never learn one bit about how that's supposed to work.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that, the show goes under a genre shift, from some \"serious\" adventure where people are trying to save the world to just your ordinary school setting (Minus the school), and them trying to find some wimpy guy known as the Mage of Exodus, which they later find, but have no clue if he is it when it's clearly obvious he is. Let's not forget how this show wasted time AGAIN with one of the most stupid things I've ever come across in anime. Two full episodes are spent on the character's going \"Who's his girlfriend?!!!\" when they should have known ALL ALONG! This just goes to show this show doesn't use its time wisely.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this show is a total failure that trolls its viewers, and the only thing is has going for it are the visuals (And just because a show has pretty visuals DOES NOT mean it's good, what really matters in the end are the story and characters, something this show doesn't have), and the soundtrack. Those that appreciate good characters, story, and shows that actually take the time to make you care about those things (Ex: One Piece, Nodame Cantabile, Eureka Seven, Neon Genesis Evangelion), avoid this at all costs. It is not worth the time.",

            "content": "Can you blame an anime for having too much... anime in it?\r\nPerhaps not, but Zetsuen no Tempest tried its dardnest to convince me of it. I do not by that mean that it has a sickening over-abundance of weathered shonen tropes, overt fanservice, cringeworthy harem setups and moe everywhere you look - it has some of these things to moderate extents, but not enough that it feels bad. Nor is it the fact that that quotes and references classical literature are a dime a dozen; a feature all too familiar with those who enjoy more philosophical and ponderous animes (and perhaps fiction in general), andone which does work within certain frameworks and in moderate amounts, but usually, as ends up the case with Tempest, winds up as a contrived and counter-productive attempt at appearing edgy and smart, leaving the overarching work with a bitter taste of pseudo-intellectuality.\\n\\n\r\nNo, in fact, Tempest surprised me by having a series of opening episodes that actually pulled me in and left me intrigued, by playing out the setup in a very fascinating manner, leaving little breathing room as you gradually get a sense of a bleak situation that leaves the necessary blanks, aided by animation and music that sets up just the right tone - something Bones has a fairly decent track record with. Indeed as the plot unfolds and unravels to the viewer, we are treated to a handful of very nice twists; some are expected but none the less engaging whilst others come as a bit of a surprise, one that makes sense in hindsight, as any good twist should. The characters as introduced appear multi-layered and there's a lot that's said by nothing being said in terms of interaction and emotion.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then... it all sort of fizzles out, not after fifteen episodes or half the series but alrady seven-eight or so episodes in it had become clear which direction it was headed, and it was not a particularly good one; I was wondering every time I was about to open the next episode. I kept hoping it didn't lose the tempo and the mood it had created - certainly, any mysterious fog about characters and the plot is bound to unravel, but it can be done elegantly or bluntly, done well or done poorly, and in some ways it did manage to keep going and hold strong to what it did well, what set it apart (and in a good sense at that) but more and more it departed and became more.... well, anime-like.\\n\\n\r\nTo be specific, then, as I already excluded what I meant by this statement, let me elaborate on what I include in this statement.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, let it be said: Zetsuen no Tempest is a story about people, who range from the completely ordinary to born with a special destiny, each is faced with carrying the fate of the world on their back to some extent or another, but choose instead to disregard this in favour of acting entirely on their own, personal reasons. People who choose revenge or love over saving the world, or finding meaning in a loved one's death. It is a very interesting angle to start with, as we are usually treated to people who without hesitation tend to accept that they must, indeed, save the world above their personal priorities. To a certain extent, the characters of Zetsuen do this, particularly as time goes on and they learn to cope with their circumstances and come to terms with reality, but they remain personally - emotionally - motivated, which serves a different angle, as indeed many people would not readily say \"OK, I'll save the world\" when presented with such a daunting task, at least not without secondary motivation.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, these personal and deeply emotional motivations often find themselves stranded in a vacuum. They are is repeatedly portrayed with an illogical sort of unreasonableness; not just one that can be waved away with basis in the fact that emotions are by nature unreasonable. Rather, it approaches a level of nonsensicality that extends quite beyond the scope of the human condition, it becomes a rather wishy-washy and forced excuse for the characters acting on their own impulses and not caring about saving the world (even though they deep down do), again suffering from the sort of assumed edginess that endless quotes of Shakespearian works are symptomatic of. It is the sort of unreasonableness that is often seen in anime characters as their initial defining characteristics, such as acting only for love or revenge, are taken far beyond their logical conclusion, indeed, even past the often extreme points that revenge can take one - or rather than talking about moving past it ends up becoming something entirely different of a sort, still portrayed as a desire for revenge or love but stooped to a put-on and uncohesive mess that falls on its own rambling, particularly as we are treated to a set of increasingly strained exchanges towards the climax of the first act. It loses aim and purpose in a sense; that is, the plot still knows its direction but the characters and themes feel lost in some sort of hollow vacuum manufactured separate from the narrative, in order to defend their increasingly contrived stances. And, yet, in a twist of irony, it also completely forgoes these stances at times when the story deems it convenient, oft bereft of any explanation.\\n\\n\r\nAfter this, the second arc ends up being, for the most part, an increasing anticlimax where any sort of pull the story originally had becomes lost, washed away in favour of increasingly, well, anime-esque elements. As the heroine, Hakaze, asks herself in a moment of authorial self-deprecation: \"Is this some sort of romantic comedy?\" Unfortunately, making a joke at your own expense does not excuse shoddy work. It is not just the \"rom-com\" aspects as much as how everyone starts to act more towards anime stereotypes, the standards are more conformed to, scenes and themes and indeed even jokes alternating between the self-regurgitating nonsense, as previously described, and increasingly common anime tropes. It at once manages to depart from that which in a good way set it apart in faovur of the mundane, and also completely soil those more unique aspects, turning it on its head to something that kind of just leaves a bad aftertaste.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to re-ask my original question: Can it be blamed for too much an anime, for conforming to its own medium? My gut answers no, and I don't really, but unfortunately it showed a lot of excellent ways to stand apart from the rest early on, only to have that descend into utter banality and near-parodic mirroring of its once-great aspects. And I will not forgive it for introducing butt-monkey character Hanemura, who ironically ends up being almost the most relatable of the bunch at a time when the rest have long since departed any sense of reason or insight. Even so, the late introduction out of nowhere, while perhaps expected of a second arc, does not work in his favour and he feels way too weak and irrelevant a character to have the role that he has thrust upon him.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, yet, it still offers up the occasional well-placed dialogue or development, even as it goes on, and Yoshino remains an interesting character almost entirely throughout, as one who actually offers some semblance of realism in his approach to situations and particularly his emotional development is interesting to watch. The flashbacks with him and Aika are also highly enjoyable, though Aika is the main \"beneficiary\" of the frequent Shakespeare references, putting her on the put-on edginess pedestal. It should be said that the parallels to characters and themes from the relevant works of Shakespeare do sometimes work heavily in the show's favour, but mostly it falls flat and you are left wondering why it even matters. Mahiro on the other hand is an incredibly dull character, the \"cool guy\" stereotype with an added flavour of revenge to make a very overused form of anti-hero\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Zetsuen no Tempest is an anime that tries, that really tries, to do something good and different, and it almost succeeds but seems to stumble in its own feed as it gets going, which is such a shame, for it started out well. The one highly praisable thing is the soundtrack, and at times the animation, which helps set the mood it needs, but that, too, often fails its job. Most of the second half of the first arc could easily have been condensed into perhaps two episodes, and most of the second arc could have been cut entirely, or condensed equivalently, which would have lent the series the pacing and tempo it would have needed to maintain that excellent mood it sets right off the bat but quickly departs from as it descends into all-too-familiar territory.",

            "content": "Zetsuen no Tempest's driving focus plays out like some bad drama that you mother watches her free holiday mornings. The absurdity of Mahiro's obsession and Yoshino's secrets would be at home in any Shakespeare plays. \r\nLike Shakespearean works, the major draw here are the characters. While they may be extreme examples of human personalities, they never lose their believably. You find yourself drawn into their world and rooting for their success.\r\nThe story, while prone to cliche, is nonetheless interesting and immersive. The individual motivations and struggles of Mahiro, Yoshino, and Hakaze form a nice balance in the foreground of a story in which the wholeworld is upheaved. Throw in a few twists, some smart dialogue reminiscent of Death Note and you have a story sure to entertain.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I can't really pass this off a complete review due to the incomplete nature of the narrative, I highly doubt I will rank this anime lower at the end.\\n\\n\r\n8",

            "content": "An anime loosely based on Shakespeare? Why not! Not you Romeo x Juliet you are awful.\r\nZetsuen no Tempest sounds clich\u00e9 when you read the synopsis and it has been done many times before, revenge for the death of a friend or family member...who hasn't watched a anime about that central plot point? However it does distinguish itself from the herd in the way it executes the story and with the depth of the characters.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe anime heavily relies on dialogue and flashbacks to explain the story, if you want an anime with epilepsy inducing action this probably isn't the anime for you. If you likedialogue and plot twists and a few battles thrown in but not being the central focus, then I think you will find that this anime will fill that very specific anime criteria you have. The story two and fros between Yoshino and Mahiro's quest to make the world make sense again and the scantily clad Hakaze on an island doing absolutely nothing other than sleeping and eating. You also have the Kusaribe Clan in the mix reviving Tree of Exodus by chanting at it with chains. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall sounds like a pretty solid anime... No? It is not incredibly original but the conflict of good intentions from all the characters (Not Mahiro) is what separates it from the rest. They all believe they are doing what is right (Except Mahiro) and there is no clear definition of what is right and wrong just that the world is in trouble and something must be done to stop the destruction of it, and somehow all the characters have been joined in this venture and do not know why or how to stop it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I gave this anime a look and started watching the anime is due to it's art. (Picture-synopsis-watch) All the characters each have their own appearance and style, not just copy and paste the face onto a different body with a different hairstyle. The character designs may not be particularly memorable I guess Yoshino's hair grips are quite the fashion statement. The action scenes are done well and are in high quality, again not an action anime so it is not the best you will of seen but they are nothing to complain about, I guess I could about the fruit but I wont. \\n\r\nSince it is heavy on the flashbacks can you tell the difference from then and now? Yes. Do they show bright flower fields and colorful skies of happier times? Yes. Does characters hair go underneath their eyeballs? No.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nGood. It is neither outstanding or grating, it sets the tone of the scenes but definitely isn't the focus of it. I didn't walk away from the anime humming the songs, I couldn't tell you what the soundtrack in Zetsuen no Tempest sounds like. I assume it did it's job or the scenes and plot twists wouldn't of been as hard hitting, but if it had been better it could of brought the anime into a entirely different level. Cowboy Bebop & Tsubasa Chronicle Neither of them perfect, Tsubasa Chronicle being far far from it. Having a solid soundtrack can allow you to look over any flaws, Cowboy Bebop without it's good soundtrack would not have been so popular.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nWhile Mahiro is pretty generic in terms of anime badass, Yoshino is quite different. For one he has a brain rolling about in there and despite what the characters think, he doesn't blindly follow orders without his own agenda. I for one was surprised of this it really is refreshing , a quiet character with a backbone and brains? What is this witchcraft?!\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about this anime is the characters, it is why I have given the anime on a whole a good rating is due the development of them. They are all human (I know magicians and what not) they have flaws and not one of them is perfect. Mahiro is shown as a strong badass who will fight for what he believes, as the story advances it shows his more vulnerable side and his relationship with his sister and how he cannot control every situation and him trying to come to terms with his loss. Yoshino on the other hand is done opposite, he's a pushover and doesn't have a distinguishable personality of his own. Over time it is shown though he is a sheep he does have a personality hidden under his hipster glasses, also that he can fight either using his wits or his brain to outmaneuver his enemy in persuasion and battles. If I went into every character I would be here for a very long time. \\n\\n\r\nRecap; while they are not the most memorable looking or sounding bunch, the way that they are developed makes them memorable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nZetsuen no Tempest is far from being perfect, it has many quality's that are missing from animes I have watched as of late. Zetsuen no Tempest has kept me eagerly waiting for the next episode each week and it actually makes me want to read the manga just to know what's going to happen next, but it doesn't rely the manga to support it and make it coherent, it can stand on it's own. The fast paced dialogue seems quite daunting at first if you sneeze you will miss something, following the story and the characters is a great experience but it does start of on the slow side of the fence and builds up. It can be good or bad it just depends on you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nIt may not be everyone's cup of tea it is defiantly an anime worth looking into, underrated I may add. Zetsuen no Tempest has plenty of clich\u00e9s but manages to make a delicious lemonade with those clich\u00e9s changes it into something unique. Art in the anime is great and complements the story they are putting across and the fruit still hurt my eyes. The soundtrack is forgettable. Characters in Zetsuen no Tempest are the focal point in the story and anime as I have said before strengths, flaws, development of them. I hope they can continue with the way they are going with the anime and I can safely give it the title of being my Favorite anime of 2012-2013.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Zetsuen no Tempest tries to create something profound and moving but ultimately falls flat on its face. It's flashy, creative, and 'claims' that it draws inspiration from the works of William Shakespeare, mainly Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, and The Tempest, and I get why - the best Tragedy, the best Romance, and Shakespeare's final work all have powerful undertones and are infinitely quotable. The problem is, well, everything else.\r\nFirst, the plot. It's the element that everyone praises about this show, so I'll give it special attention here. Mahiro (Hamlet) and Yoshino (Romeo) are best friends, but the death of Mahiro's sister Aika (Caliban / Juliet,I'm pretty sure) sends Mahiro over the edge and his lust for vengeance divides the two. Then, Mahiro finds a message in a bottle that allows him to communicate with Hakaze (Prospero), a powerful mage who promises to find Aika's killer if Mahiro helps her get back at her own family for throwing her on a desert island. Fair enough.\\n\\n\r\nIt's the part where characters people are turning inexplicably to metal, government agents with shotguns attack Yoshino, and giant 'fruit' start popping out of the earth and ocean that everything starts to go wrong. I say 'fruit', because that's what the show calls them. In reality, they're giant rocks with eyeballs popping out and trees on top, plus a couple giant chains stuck to them that get yanked out of the ground with them. Did I mention that they appear in the dozens at a time and fly through the air? Yeah, this show is weird.\\n\\n\r\nCrazy is a natural part of anime - some of my favorites are the wackier ones - but the problems arise when none of these events are explained except in the loosest of terms, and after about three episodes of action and plot, the show comes to a SCREECHING halt. About three episodes in a row are spent almost entirely in flashbacks, mainly illustrating how Aika was a crazy horny b*tch with... well, I won't spoil it. But it shatters the pacing completely and gives essentially no meaningful insight into the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Story is a 4/10 - it tries really hard to be several things at once (action, psychological, dramatic, occasionally comedic) and it backfires SPECTACULARLY.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArtistic style in Zetsuen no Tempest is very good, honestly, not much you can knock it for. It's pretty, it's effective, and it feels distinct from other similar shows. The only drawback is the occasional overuse of certain repeating scenes (like the chanting at the Magic Tree). 8/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound design is a controversial element for the show - it uses a lot of classical music, which I find fits the show perfectly, and had my blood pumping quite a lot. However, the melodramatic music when they're showing how nuts Aika is for the 47th time, or the tension they try to build when Mahiro acts like a psychopath AGAIN gets old very, very quickly. The best moments hit a 9/10 easily, but the worst are a 5/10, so 7/10 seems like a good compromise.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design in Zetsuen no Tempest is, well, pretty terrible. Their characters are 'inspired' by Shakespearean protagonists, but in truth it's only in the loosest of terms. Mahiro lacks the core qualities of Hamlet - his indecisiveness, his pensiveness, the resentment and guilt that make him such a compelling character. Mahiro is your typical Shonen hero, reckless with a devil-may-care attitude and a chaotic rhythm to his behavior, and that's fine, but it's NOT BLOODY HAMLET.\\n\\n\r\nYoshino is Romeo only in that he had a tragic romance, but Romeo is defined by his ability to bounce back after a bad breakup (Rosaline at the beginning of the play, I believe). He's passionate, optimistic, and is lead by his heart, not his head. In contrast, Yoshino is a cool, calculating and dour figure who is defined by apathy and his ability to outsmart his opponents. So, not Romeo in the slightest. I could go on, but I assume you got the gist. 6/10, for not following their inspiration in the SLIGHTEST, and for reverting to type instead. You could replace the protagonists with Natsu and Gray from Fairy Tail, or Ichigo and Ishida from Bleach and you wouldn't notice much.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is a sticky category. You see, I still enjoyed the everloving HELL out of this anime, for the most part. My girlfriend grinned every time they quoted Shakespeare, and there was a lot of unintentional comedy with some of the shots. One quick shot of a cat turned into metal with a weird expression had us in fits for the rest of the episode, and the fact that I anticipated ALL of the plot twists by basically saying whatever I thought was the most ridiculous thing I could think of at that moment led to no end of fun. 8/10, because fun is fun no matter what.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show merits a 7/10, Good. The visual and sound design are attractive distractions from the silly plot, overblown drama, and flying-rock-eyeball-fruit-things, but if you're looking for depth and a compelling narrative, look elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nI know this review will get me no end of flak, but honestly, to those of you who watched the first season completely, tell me that Yoshino's solution to Hakaze's 'problem' isn't absolutely ludicrous.",

            "content": "Before reading this review, you need to put in mind that I watched after the original run . so, my perspective would differ from that of those who watched a single episode per week. One more thing,  I tried my best to make it spoiler free no need to worry..\r\nCharacters:\r\nLet me  start by stating that there isn\u2019t a real main character in this anime. Which I quite liked . For once everyone get their fare share of screen-time  and character development. The Characters are linked in a very impressive way. you will see that the character\u2019s are quite solid , attractive andunique . They have depth , dimensions and great character development . You have the guy who seems reckless and restless but can easily be tamed by logic, The girl who seems mighty and unshakable who\u2019s in fact have the heart of a teenager that can be swayed by passion, the guy who seems kind and indifferent  but has his own deep dark secrets . Those who are considered to be traitors but have their reasonable motives etc ...I have to say that it\u2019s one of the strongest points in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nFirst Half:\\n\r\nFor a 24 episode anime, it\u2019s expected for the first 5-8 episodes to be invested on characters introduction and story establishment . ZNT is an exception. It throws you right in the middle and gradually reveals its story. This should be an advantage but it turns out to be quite the opposite .. Because the first half of the show sat a very high standard, The second half had a problem keeping up with it., but let\u2019s save that for later .. \\n\r\nZNT is a character driven anime so, psychology plays an important part in it. The story is simply amazing . You can see that all possibilities were considered ,  every detail was well thought out and explained reasonably. Every action had a logical internal drive . Although action plays an important part in it ,I wouldn\u2019t recommend this for people who don\u2019t want to use their brain or want a straight forwarded action anime. ZNT is  not about pure action . there is no good or evil in it .It\u2019s about logic , reasoning and  standing for your beliefs you can say that it has a literary feel ( only natural since it\u2019s inspired from Shakespeare\u2019s plays) It may not appeal for all viewers. \\n\\n\r\nSecond Half:\\n\r\nThis is where the anime starts to struggle, It seems as if the anime no longer knows what it wants to be. It switches between slice of life, romance and even teen drama. Luckily for me, I had the choice to watch as many episodes as I want but I can understand where those -who had to wait a week after the other for a single episode - are coming from. It\u2019s not entirely bad but when you compare it with the intensity of the first half it simply falls short.(if it was set in the beginning of the show I doubt anyone would\u2019ve minded) \\n\r\nMany people disliked what had come of characters (mostly Hakaze). I don\u2019t want to give spoilers so I\u2019m going to address this briefly , you people need to put in mind that these characters are created to simulate humans who are NOT perfect. You can\u2019t expect them to be cool and awesome- or whatever- all the time. Hakaze spent her life between the country and a deserted island . Her actions are only natural for a teenager going through ( .. ) for the first time. And giving all she\u2019s been through.. anyways, it pays to be patient. The show does redeem itself unlike other shows .. cough~ .. SAO.. The last few episodes are on fire. It will blow your mind . All the masteries are uncovered beautifully and the end is very satisfactory.\\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment : I truly enjoyed this anime. It had its flaws but it\u2019s a great watch after all . It\u2019s worthy to give it a chance . I guaranty that you\u2019ll end up with at least a good watch .The art and sound are incredible . The animation is top notch . The story is -no matter what- original and the characters are memorable. \\n",

            "content": "Now it might sound very clich\u00e9 that these two teenagers are on a travel to save the world, but luckily the series does it very well in that regard.\r\nI can start of mentioning the two lesser good things about Zetusen no Tempest:\r\n1. Fuwa Mahiro. One of the main protagonists. At times, he can be too much of a hot-blooded shounen character. Rushes straight into matters with simple and brute solutions, fueled by the emotion of revenge. While this is a good counterpart to the other protagonist and his friend, the intelligent and methodical Takigawa Yoshino, Mahiro's personality can be a bit clich\u00e9d and predictable attimes, but he also has his good moments.\\n\\n\r\n2. The first few episodes. While I never got a feeling that the pacing of the these first episodes was never rushed, the plot progressed kinda slow. It's not a big issue, but I feel like there could be a slight improvement here. However, this allowed more time to get to know the characters and the situation of the world. It just would be swell if there was a perfect balance between the amount of exposition and plot progression. But after those few episodes, things start to heat up pretty fast!\\n\\n\r\nNow for the good stuff:\\n\\n\r\n- Story: As already mentioned, the whole teenagers-out-to-save-the-world-thing is old as hell, but the way it was executed was rather surprising and unconventional in a good way. You know those typical solutions of typical shounen characters? The ones where they pull a superpower or something similar out of their asses and suddenly the problem is solved? Well, nothing of that here! Here we actually have characters that fight equally with superpowers and words. While the action parts can be entertaining to watch, it is the clever fights with words that steal the show. Words that are carefully crafted with logic, reasoning and lies can even have the power to the turn the tide of a conflict. That itself is something few animes (and far less in shounen animes) can do well, and well Zetsuen no Tempest does.\\n\\n\r\n- Art: I dare say that the art surpassed the manga version. It has a lot cleaner look and emphasized the characters' personalities better than in the manga. Seeing how the drawer for the manga was responsible for the character design of the anime, it isn't too odd, really. Luckily, the production value of this part is a lot higher than your average shounen anime. And for that, I am glad, for Zetusen no Tempest truly deserves it. As far I noticed, there were no cheap shortcuts for the animation and such. The series has a quality feel to it.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound: The music. Without a doubt, the most surprising part of the anime. Here I was expecting somewhat generic music to accompagny the art and story. But boy, was I wrong. The exception is the first opening song. While it isn't necessary a bad song on its own, but it doesn't match too well of the tone of the anime. My favorite track of Zetsuen no Tempest is without the second opening song (\"Daisuki na no ni\" by Kylee). It's a catchy and beautiful song with lyrics that fit with the show. Other than that, the show has music that fits with the mood, created with real instruments rather than computer-generated. It really helps set the mood of the moments of the show.\\n\\n\r\n- Characters: I already mentioned the bad things about Fuwa Mahiro, so I'll let that be. But the real star of the show is his friend Takigawa Yoshino. Even just a high-schooler, he is a rather intelligent individual that would rather fight with words and wit than brawn and might. Overall a cool and composed character that is hard to not like. The other characters can be a hit or miss. Just about all characters you meet, are in some way used in future episodes and not just \"thrown away\" like they tend to do in other shounen series. However, some of them don't add too much than other characters. This is more of a nitpick from my side.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, a great series. Too bad the anime didn't cover the epilogue that the manga had. Let's hope they produce this if many enough people enjoy the show! ^^",

            "content": "Zetsuen No Tempest, is it your typical action anime? Definitely not. This anime is not solely based on action and good defeats evil, it makes you think about whether the side you are supporting is worth supporting or not which makes this anime so much more interesting. This review is based on the first 13 episodes of the show, if my opinion changes in the course of the next episodes I will edit this review.\r\nStory:--> 9\r\nAt first the story may seem kind of confusing and cliche at some parts, but after the first 7-8 episodes, you will throw your doubts away. The story is actuallyreally interesting and has many twists and turns which will keep you wanting more and eager for the next episode. The story basically starts of with one character (Mahiro) wanting revenge for his sister death, and another character (Yoshino) who basically follows Mahiro and also wants to stop the black iron syndrome. Honestly, when i read the summary for the first time, it sort of reminded me of \"Guilty Crown\" which is another show that i started to like, but over time got more and more disappointed with  it because of it's lack of proper story telling and the amount of questions left unanswered at the end. Zetsuen No Tempest is the exact opposite, it starts of mild but then gets stronger and stronger over time. I am definitely excited with that the story holds in the future.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters -->10\\n\r\nThe character design in the show was simply amazing, each character has amazing personalities. Even if they are complete opposites, Mahiro and Yoshino are still best friends but they still keep many secrets from each other, which I feel would lead to a great plot twist in the near future. The character development is also very interesting, it makes you feel the characters pain and helps you understand them. Its something with these two characters, Mahiro and Yoshino that draws you towards them. The Character have so much depth, that I feel that there is still a lot we need to learn about them.\\n\\n\r\nArt -->9\\n\r\nThe art in this show is also pretty good as well, it has good character designs, and very nice animation for when the action scenes occur and the back drops are just amazing. you could tell that a lot of detail was put into the design of the show. If you have seen some of the new shows such as guilty crown, and sword art online, you won't be blown away because it looks similar to other animes, but it still is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall if you are interested in a show where you need to concentrate, and also requires a lot of your focus, Zetsuen No Tempest is prefect for you. It has a good mix of action and dialogue scenesm and both action and dialogue are amazing, un like some shows where the action is amazing but dialogue is boring and dull *cough* guilty crown *cough*. I highly recommend this show, and it seems like the perfect time to start it since the 2013 winter season seems kind of boring, so it is a perfect time to catch up or start a new show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Zetsuen no Tempest a rating of 9/10. Enjoy.",

It tries to combine some existential theories aka the tree of Genesis, which is the god of the world who instills all characters to do as he wants ( or that's what I believe) because everything is messed up.\r\nThe anime starts simple, and exciting, 2 young guys grieve a girl's death, one comes in contact with magic and they go on a journey.\r\nBut that journey turns into a lame nerve-killer debate regarding the logicof the world, the flow of time, etc.\\n\r\nMost of the characters dialogues and thoughts are cliche and predictable, thus very annoying.",

Just like full metal alchemist... it takes a while for the story to set. Still everything before that is utterly of importance. Not only does this anime make you switch sides in who is good or bad but also question the way you thought you understood it. \r\nI reccomend anyone who has not seen this to watch it... its amazing",

            "content": "Zetsuen no Tempest is the best anime I have watched for quite some time.\r\nIt's great.\r\n9.2/10\r\nTempest has a solid story, intriguing and very well thought-out design, powerful characters (as in likable, well writen characters), and very solid pacing.\r\nAll of these are stuff I have been missing from shows for months now. I've been stuck with shows that don't manage to make you care for the characters even after 12 episodes.\r\nTempest makes you want them right from the start!\r\nIt really is a mark of greatness when a show can introduce a character with just one or two episodes and make you like them instantly. A rare mark.\r\nTheonly faults I found with the show is that mid-series there's a twist, and it changes the situations for the MCs quite. It's not bad, doesn't really take anything away from the show, but I would have liked to see more of the setting they had during the first half.\\n\r\nAlso they referenced Shakespeare way too often. I understand why they reffered to the plays Hamlet and The Tempest both writen by Shapespeare and both relatable to the story in some way, it really brings with it an uncertanity. You don't know which play the shows ending will refer too, and that keeps you guessing as to how it all might end.\\n\r\nBut during a few episodes it felt like they put way to many references into the single episode, like one per every 4 minutes.\\n\r\nIt gave of the feeling of talking to a person who saw Hamlet yesterday and is qouting it like he knew it all his life. Even tough he never heard of William Shapespeak before that.\\n\\n\r\nThis critique sounds really silly and unecessary, and that's because it is.\\n\r\nI had a really hard time finding faults with this show, especially since I don't review the sound or art unless it's extreme of some sort.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a very good show. You respect the characters because they acctually seem intellectual. You respect the story and setting because it isn't made too convenient. And you respect the ending because the show keeps you guessing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy!",

            "content": "This was one of those series that I had randomly happened to stumble upon on one of my days off. It just so happened to hook and reel me in so strongly that I started and finished all 24 episodes in one sitting -- with the obvious restroom and food breaks. That said, I have no regrets about those 10 hours of my life.\r\nAlthough this series had the potential for a lot of overwhelming magic battles, a majority of the fights were fought through words and plot devices. I'm not really one for drawn out dialogues, but within this series, it was very well doneand kept me hooked. There were three consecutive episodes where the characters hadn't moved an inch, but I hadn't noticed -- and wouldn't have cared even if I did. I was at the edge of my seat until the end. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the characters. I'm normally a freak for romance, but didn't even mind that there was no hint or suggestion of such until mid-series. The two main protagonists gave me a Nartuo x Sasuke feel, and the plot had set up for many instances where that rivalry could stir up -- but both were able to handle things maturely. Which I feel is pretty rare in anime, so that was pleasantly surprising. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself was fairly original. I enjoyed the way that by mid-series, I had trained myself to expect the unexpected. This led to my only anticipating a few key parts of the story, as opposed to having most plot \"mysteries\" figured out before they were revealed, per usual.",

            "content": "Slow-paced animes usually steal my essence of \u2018watching with enjoyment\u2019. Some even have more episodes than usual short animes (those with 12 or -teen episodes), 20s episodes. It\u2019s considered boring and clich\u00e9 to boot.\r\nBut, hey, what about Zetsuen no Tempest?\r\nThey say it\u2019s slow-paced. I can\u2019t blame them for it, as I myself find it\u2019s true. But I daresay that they would at least say Zetsuen no Tempest is not your usual slow-paced clich\u00e9 show. Yes, it\u2019s true.\r\nI\u2019ve tried finding any similar anime to this. Yet, I found none so far. Yes, it\u2019s empirically a unique one.\r\nTo  me, this is one in a million piecesof work. I\u2019m not a big fan of slow-going shows. Still, Zetsuen no Tempest is surprisinglly one of those laggards, and I can\u2019t help but intrigued by it. The truth is the show doesn\u2019t a jot bore me to the end.\\n\\n\r\nTaken from an outstanding poet, The Bard Shakespeare\u2019s pieces of writing namely \u2018Twil*ahem*\u2019, pardon me, \u2018Tem*est\u2019, \u2018Ha*let\u2019 and *ahem*, what else? Well, that\u2019s all. It is said that the story is associated with some aforementioned writing, which ending is the converse of the other ending. Well, to put it simple, Zetsuen no Tempest is (mainly) about two opposing entities, the Tree of Origins and the Tree of World's End, trying to dominate each other for some veiled reason and of course, both powers have the potential to either create or devastate the world.\\n\r\nIt starts with a murdered girl whose murderer is unknown. Mahiro, the brother of the murdered girl can\u2019t accept his kid sister\u2019s unreasonable death and commits himself to find the murderer and kill them with his own hands. He ends up dragging his friend Yoshino and collaborating with a powerful but stranded witch in order to find his sister\u2019s murderer and they inevitably involved in witchcraft. They work together but share no same goal. The witch and her freedom, the lad and his revenge and the dragged and his . . . . .\\n\r\nThe following clues might help you find out what Zetsuen no Tempest is about:\\n\r\n-\tmystery\\n\r\n-\tsave the world\\n\r\n-\tquotes from some pieces of writing\\n\r\n-\tsynergy and collaboration\\n\r\n-\tlove\\n\r\n-\trevenge\\n\r\n-\twhite magic vs black magic\\n\r\nI\u2019ll tell you why this anime is a must-watch:\\n\r\n-\tit\u2019s unique\\n\r\n-\tit has quirky characters\\n\r\n-\tit doesn\u2019t contain nudity (as long as you\u2019re not a pervert)\\n\r\n-\tdespite it\u2019s slow, it\u2019s intriguing\\n\r\n-\thas great features\\n\r\n-\tit\u2019s peculiarly romantic\\n\r\n-\tno fuss, just trust me\\n\r\nYoshino, Hakaze, Aika, Mahiro are examples of one strong point in this show. Yes, one strong point of this anime is it\u2019s characters. How they develop and deal with the situations, despite the problems is what makes me can continue watching the show despite it\u2019s slow paces. It\u2019s more than needing a hero to be able to conquer an enormous power. Cooperation is the best way to fight against this, even if it means you\u2019re to collaborate with your enemy.\\n\r\nThe supporting characters really do their job (supporting the show) well. I\u2019m pretty sure one character that can both annoy and intrigue is Fuwa Aika.\\n\r\nThe sounds do support the show, a strong point. Voice actors suit the characters very well, the music deserves praise. It\u2019s catchy, no joke. You know what I mean, don\u2019t you?\\n\r\nThe art is another strong point, well, it\u2019s distinctive after all. Also, it\u2019s flexible but not loose.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I enjoy this and I am sure most people do, too.\\n\r\nAre you looking for a slow but great anime?\\n\r\nAre you short of good show?\\n\r\nOr, are you confused by so many choices of anime?\\n\r\nZetsuen no Tempest: The Civilization Blaster is a rare thing you probably won\u2019t find anywhere else once you miss the chance finding it. Yes, I am talking about a treasure.\\n",

            "content": "Absolutely fantastic. This series helped me remember why I love Shakespeare so much. To prevent rambling, I'll try to make this review as concise as possible. \r\nStory: 10\r\nThe story drew heavily upon Hamelt and The Tempest. Both are stories of revenge. However, if you are familiar with the works, the stories end very differently. In Hamlet, the story of revenge ends in tragedy for all parties involved. In the Tempest, the story ends with forgiveness and happiness. The anime focues on the question, which revenge story will Zetsuen turn out to be? Will it end in tragedy? Or will it end in happiness and forgiveness?I won't spoil it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nWell done. Nothing more to say.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, well done. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime shines with its characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI will have to note, Zetsuen is enjoyable because it is rather unique. There are some cliches and tropes present throughout the story but as a whole, I can confidently call Zetsuen special and refreshingly novel. When I finished, I took a deep breath and smiled. Why? Because I was content with learning a new story. Try it.",

            "content": "This is I think the the only review about Zetsuen no tempest which will explain why this anime is overrated and not underrated as a lot of people are calling it. Before I start I want to say that this is only my opinion. I don't want (and I'll try not to) insult anyone else's opinion.\r\nFirst of all I want to state that I love theater. I love watching theater and I love even more to act.  So wen I heard that this was influenced by Shakespeare's plays ''The Tempest'' and ''Hamlet'' I was more than excited to see it. And  indeedthe story seemed really interesting. In fact Zetsuen no Tempest has a really unique and interesting plot full of plot twists from the start until the end. But there was a point where it lacked. ZnT  could not get away from the shounen label. That way a really interesting storyline  which could be made into an amazing seinen was held back by silly comedy relief as well as a really pointless second part. Especially with the latter I had a big problem because after a strong first part which had some really huge plot twists that were making you want to see the next episode instantly we went to a romance-driven second half that was a huge obstacle for the story development.\\n\r\nThe thing that I loved in this anime was certainly the art but to tell the truth this was not something unexpected. When was the last that Bones disappointed in terms of animation?\\n\r\nLet's move to the sound section. The openings were horrible and the endings uninteresting. On the other hand the background music was really good and the voice actors do a fair job, everyone corresponding right in their roles.\\n\r\nAnd now it's time for the characters of this anime. Due to the shounenish elements that I spoke before the characters themselves could not get away from the unavoidable cliches.We had the ambitious Mahiro and the genius Yoshino as the protagonists as well as the yandere Hakaze and a bunch of other cliche and unoriginal characters. I found Mahiro and Yoshino really exaggerated as characters. Especially Mahiro was annoying and unreasonable in most of the anime. Another huge disappointment was Samon's character. This guy turned from an interesting villain to ridiculous comedy relief!!! And just don't make me talk about Aika. Generally speaking almost all characters were really uninteresting. The only thing that saved them somehow was the kinda fair development the main characters had near the ending.\\n\r\nWhile and before I watch this anime I was hearing people saying how underrated this anime was.  That had made me put my hopes really high and I ended up really disappointed. Zetsuen no Tempest has a really interesting concept  but very uninteresting story progression and characters which hold it back from being a masterpiece. But i believe that I was the only one seeing it this way. Everybody else loved it so I would  recommend you to watch this anime and make your own opinion. You may like it more than I did.",

All of the 4 main characters are individually strong and have their own skills to offer. Furthermore, the female characters are stronger (both physically and emotionally) than their male counterparts. As this is a huge departure from most standard anime fare, that in and of itself raises Zetsuen no Tempest in my esteem. \r\nOn top of this, Zetsuen no Tempest has an intriguing story-line with suspense as well as great art and graphics quality. The only thing that I could mention as a minus is the wayhumor is suddenly introduced around episode 10. Suddenly, the atmosphere changes from almost always serious and foreboding, to regular injections of humor. The problem is not the humor itself, but the fact that the material mostly has to do with breaking the 4th wall and a lot of inner monologues that keep pointing out the ridiculousness of the situation we see. When a lot of this has to do with how ridiculous it is that the world and the government is depending on teenagers (with their own teenage dramas) for saving, the immersion of the viewer is compromised.",

            "content": "By combining the dramatic style of Shakespear's play \"The Tempest\" with modern vision of magic, this anime surely doesn't fail to be original. The backstory is too chaotic and the pacing too irregular to really make it fully enjoyable, though. Some elements of the plot seem awfully detached or illogical, but nonetheless the story is intriguing till the end.\r\nAs for artistry, great work by BONES as usual. Nice and rich backgrounds and distinct atmosphere make this anime a pure pleasure to watch. Characters are very well animated and their emotions are perfectly conveyed. Both music and voice acting is top-notch in ZnT (Kana Hanazawa asAika, OMG). Soundtrack is as ambitious, solemn and dramatic as an ost of series inspired by \"The Tempest\" should be. May be a bit tiresome after a while with its constant pomposity, though, which is a minor fault.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest strength of ZnT are the characters. Fantastic, unpredictable and almost hypnotizing Fuwa Aika is the true highlight of the show, but all characters are well constructed and way more intricate than your average anime character. Shakespear would like it that way, I believe.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\r\nA very good anime that, despite messy backstory and unclear concept, redeems itself with great characters, artistry and music.",

            "content": "I ventured to watch this anime with expectations quite high since I was intrigued by the synopsis. At times it came up to my scratch, at time it didn't, and finally when I finished watching it, here's what I have to say.\r\nStory - 7\r\nIn a nutshell, Yoshino a childhood \"friend\" of Mahiro follows him in his quest to find the killer of his mysteriously murdered young sister Aika, in the meantime in order to find the killer Mahiro had made a deal with a real mage, and side effects of this deal include saving the world and traveling through time. It's an original formula, thoughit does pretend to be more than it actually is; still it does its job and keeps you in suspense for a while.\\n\\n\r\nLets be clear, this anime consists of two separate halves, first 12 or so episodes, and the rest episodes afterward. First half of the story is quite thrilling and closely resembles a detective story in fact: here are two childhood friends, a mysteriously murdered \"sister\", bizarre phenomena that turn whole towns into graveyards of iron and agents of magic. There's the tragic music, and citing from Hamlet and Tempest by Shakespeare and otherwise romanticist stuff including time paradoxes and so on.  And would have been desirable if it continued in the same spirit, yet the second half falls victim to awkward romcom. There is significantly less action, but more long-winded dialogue that doesn't contribute much to the character development and as a result that acute feeling of impending dramatic events is distilled.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\\n\r\nQuite beautiful clean style, with spectacular design for magic spells. The animation is good enough, smooth and consistent throughout the series; it looks especially great during action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\\n\r\nThe music has some dramatic tunes, quite to fit in the whole Shakespeare theme. I won't call it particularly stunning because it wasn't exactly memorable. I disliked most of OP and ED songs, save for those rendered by Nothing's Carved in Stone, because to my mind they didn't quite fit to overall mood of the series and strikingly fell out of picture.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Yoshino, Mahiro and Aika in Zetsuen no Tempest are pretty much the key elements to the plot. As implied in the series, they represent the characters from Shakespeare's plays, Hamlet which is a tragedy and Tempest which has a happy end. And throughout the series they have to strive to win their happy ending. Aika's character undoubtedly is the driving force behind the plot. Though not apparent in the beginning, her true importance and real extent of her power will blossom in later episodes. The secondary characters aren't anything special and mostly appear for comic relief or plot narration.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7.5\\n\\n\r\nIt was quite enjoyable experience despite it being a little long-winded at times. If you are a fan of magic and time paradoxes, then this anime is right for you.",

            "content": "Hello, people! I'm here to bring you a review of what is one of my favourite anime, Blast of Tempest (Zetsuen no Tempest)\r\nThe tl;dr version: Blast of Tempest was able to tell an exciting adventure, filled with twists and turns around the mechanics of the universe. The main characters were al well developed and characterized over the course of the series, and the cast in general was a refreshing way of using common shounen characteristics. However, as much as I liked the show, its second half wasn't nearly as good as the first was. Finally, the art and animation were great as well, as bothdelivered fantastic imagery and action scenes. Now for the actual review!\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis story revolves around two different subplots, one of the MC's quest for revenge and the battle of two different magical Gods (the Trees - Tree of Genesis and Tree of Exodus)\\n\\n\r\nThe first aspect I want to bring up is the mystery and fantasy component of the series. Something that I love about fantasy in anime is when the mechanics behind it are a mystery that get well explained later on. Which is something Blast of Tempest achieved with top marks. Right in beginning, we are able to see some weird occurrences around the magic of each Tree. The way magic works in the show is revealed in the most shocking way, completely turning around what you thought you knew about it. However, most mysteries are explained in the first half of this show, which means most of the twists were also done in this first half, so the second half was more lackluster.\\n\\n\r\nThe next aspect is the action, it is an aspect I don't really feel passionate about in anime in general, so I'll cut down to the chase. The battle scenes were mostly short and well presented, with some great battle sequences and interesting strategies to win the fight. Again, I can't say much about it since it's not exactly my cup of tea.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the drama and the romance aspect of this series. The drama was really great, as it resolved each of the main cast's life issues and problems  in a well-written manner without having unnecessary scenes (by which I mean scenes specifically done to try to get you crying). What I wasn't too fond of, however, was the romance it threw in the second half. It was what put down this half the most, as there were a lot of scenes that featured one of the strong-hearted characters going head-over-heels with the MC which, in my opinion, went against the tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main cast of this show would be: Yoshino, Hakaze, Mahiro and Aika.\\n\\n\r\nNow, one thing that I have to congratulate this show for, would be its main cast. Each individual character is unique, and not in a way it has a certain quirk that makes them funny and somewhat memorable, but because the characterization they had throughout the whole show made us see just how they are, made us understand, not only their motives, but to be capable of understanding their feeling towards a certain something.\\n\\n\r\nOn the more particular side of things, Yoshino, one of the male protagonists, had some seriously good development. He started out as an emotionless character (not literally of course). A character that, at the beginning, didn't seem to have all that much goals that he wanted to accomplish. When he started to fight to save the world, many characters around him were wondering just why he was doing it. But, as we see more and more of him, we start to understand the motives behind what he did. And then came the development after a certain talk, at which point he started to actually cry and have more emotions.\\n\\n\r\nWe also have the supportive cast. It's here that there are some problems in the character department. While we have Fraulein Yamamoto, Hanemura and Samon were all well characterized and had interesting personalities, other characters of this supporting cast didn't have their deserved moments. There were characters in this show that played a great part in the final outcome, yet they were never given much attention, which is what put this part down the most.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thing worth noting is the character interactions and dialogue. A lot of the show is actually spent with the characters talking to each other. Not exactly in a Monogatari sort of way, since it's not at the same level, but the exchanges were still a very nice touch. Not to mention that whenever Aika's on scene prepare for some Shakespear quotes.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nBlast of Tempest has delivered really good and detailed frames, but there is one particular frame that I absolutely adore. The anime, between other feats, made one of the most artistic death scenes I've seen in an anime. The particular way it was detailed, the red blood contrasting with the rest of the frame, I could go on.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is also really good as well, as the action sequences were all very detailed and without any immediate flaws.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, here's the thing about Blast of Tempest, because even though the story is quite amazingly wriiten and the characters are well developped, it still has that Shounen light. It has the character that acts without thinking and goes head-first into danger; the wimpy character that later goes stronger; the nakama power-ups; and the light-hearted fanservice humour. The anime is able to pick the right moments to be funny, resulting in one of the truest quotes and an incredibly enjoyable show altogether.\\n\\n\r\nNotes\\n\r\nThis show is available on Hulu and Crunchyroll\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.8 = 9\\n",

            "content": "I gave an overall rating of 7. This is my and only thoughts of the anime.\r\nPerhaps it's just me but i find this anime a real drag on. If i were to described it, this anime is like an onion where you need to peel layer by layer to reach the core. This anime is just like it, snippets by snippets of information at every episode before you reach the final truth at the last of it.\r\nThe story was fair, but given the circumstances, this anime could be shorten by removing unnecessary flashbacks and dialogue. I find myself trying to be patient to go bythe flow but i could not stop myself from trying to fast forward the story as the anime was to slow-paced for me. 13 episodes should be sufficient.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was above average, portraying emotions as clear as crystal.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects was sufficient, and not giving any additional effects on the audience.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were good, it's just again, they are too moving slow for me. The thoughts are replaying themselves and it does not expose much of the character. \\n\\n\r\nThus, this anime was almost mundane and dull to me, with the least of humor in this. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch an anime to pass time, this is it. But if you want to watch an anime with meaning, this isn't the one. However, the only best part of this anime is how well the lines from literature classics, like The Tempest and Hamlet were quoted at suitable times, like the whole anime is based on them. I would recommend to read the classics more than to watch this anime. This anime is pure fantasy with little connection to the real world.",

            "content": "The concept behind the story was pretty interesting, with mages skirmishing and mysterious events taking place all around the main duo. The plot twists were well-placed and made perfect sense in the grand scheme of things. I also liked the references to Hamlet and The Tempest, as well as their ties to the story as a whole. Overall, the writers did a great job on the story. Ultimately, I don't have anything bad to say in this department.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe artstyle was a little underwhelming given the nature of the story, but that could just be my personal taste. The way I would've imagined a storylike this, an artstyle similar to the cold, foggy atmosphere of Steins;Gate would've made this anime a solid 9 or even higher in my book. On the other hand, many of the action scenes were bright and exciting to watch. Overall, I'd say that the artstyle was a little above average.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST itself was also a little less than I would've expected given such a grandiose storyline, but I did find myself watching the first OP every time it came on, which is odd as I usually skip the OP in most anime that I watch. Overall, the soundtrack was fitting, but nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters (or at least the important ones) were well-fleshed out, with out-of-character actions and outbursts carrying great significance in the plot. Some of the character interactions (most notably when Samon and Yoshino were having their battle of wits in front of the the Tree of Exodus) felt weird and out of place, but they were tolerable and didn't really hinder my enjoyment of the show a great deal. If anything, aside from the artstyle, some of the character interactions are probably what held me back from giving this anime a full-on 9 rating. That being said, the development of Mashiro and Yoshino, as well as the circumstances surrounding Aika and her identity were handled extremely well, so many of this show's shortcomings in character interactions are accounted for.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI personally had a great time watching this anime, and would watch again in the future if I had nothing else to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I gave this show an 8.5/10 since I knew it had the potential to be a 9/10 show, but it did have its shortcomings and setbacks. That being said, it's still a fun show to watch, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's interested.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5/10",

            "content": "Hmm.. How to describe this anime? Well the word strange pops into mind. To make it easier (on me) I'll use a general format in reviewing. \r\nStory:6\r\nWell the story is interesting at least and it does have a story going for it. The concept is not totally original and that's fine, but what bothered me about the story was the authors constant (overstatement) reminder of what it is based on.  While it is good for an author to give credit and I like that, the story is also it's own. \r\nArt:9 \r\nAbout the art, it's good no complaints. The background is crisp and clearand detailed and the characters are appealing. The two main characters, especially are very appealing that is one thing that interested me that the author had done. And it's not just because they are bishounen either. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:9\\n\r\nAlong with using the art, the author has established the characters, especially, again the two main characters. I found way more interest in them then most main characters and I ended up looking at them more than the background or anything else. The only problem I had with the way the characters looked is 1. They wore the same clothes for at least half of the show and 2. Why on earth was Hakaze wearing a miniskirt with no tights in the winter? Isn't she cold? She didn't even act cold.  (ok back to my review) As far as personality the two main characters were fully established and I really felt a sense of who they were. Aika as well. As for Hakaze and the others they felt a tad cookie cutter to me along with their character design but I was not opposed to them or anything.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nAs far as the sound goes it's one of the worst I've seen in a anime. That sounds pretty harsh but it really wasn't that bad, just that sound in most anime's tends to exceptionally good. The OP and ED didn't really fit the anime and it just didn't really work for me with the feeling of the anime. The Music was especially disappointing because it serves usually for 20-30% of my score on an anime. It really matters to me! As far as the background music it was not good, not good at all. Seemed to me they only had 1 or 2 tracks of background music and they just kept repeating them. That wouldn't be so bad except for the fact that they did not use the BG music to help them. For ex. On the serious scenes they would play the same BG music for the not serious scenes and so on. If it didn't hinder those scenes, it certainly did not help them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 7\\n\r\nI didn't find this to be a bad anime at all, it was actually pretty interesting. The characters actually really played into the anime's strength. However the ending to this was disappointing, and this anime didn't have a significant meaning. It played around a lot with ideals, but in the end I never really got a definite opinion, if you know I mean. And in the end I never understood what the author was trying to say. \\n\\n\r\nP.s. This is my first review and in some ways I don't really like this reviewing format but I found it easier in the present moment.",

            "content": "Zetsuen no Tempest is much like a Ferrari on a brisk winter's morn, it takes a few seconds for the engines first roar, but damn even Mufasa would be proud!\r\nThis anime is amazing if you can get past the first few episodes of stage setting but once it gets rolling, its unputdownunable.\r\nThis anime focuses a lot on the concept of logic and what defines it, and ultimately climaxes in a fight against logic itself.\r\nIts very refreshing to find a Shounen without a 'big, evil baddy' and this allows the fight for survival to bring together many people who dislike each other, and character interactions areintriguing and exciting.\\n\r\nThe only department where I find trouble among the main characters' personalities:  the lack of any emotion in the two lead males except an anger and lust for revenge, which while it allows for a very compelling driving force to justify the lengths they go to, it also weakens the interactions of theirs with the other characters, making them seem very two dimensional.\\n\r\nThis is especially evident in the ending, when all is said and done, where they could have made the anime truly emotional and memorable. A few tears would have been respected.\\n\r\nThe supporting characters have very strong and diverse roles and they keep the show very 'crispy', though no comedy shall be found here.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have a keen eye for nice story twists then take a look at this anime. I guarantee it shall not disappoint!!",

It had a good plot, character development, and most importantly it just made me watch more. However, the only reason I chose 8 for the story was that it didn't have a twist I was expecting for the second-half. It was plain and I don't want to spoil anything but the ending was very typical. This was because the ending for the first half was one of the best ends I have ever seen. However, itwas disappointing to see the transition after the first end. The openings were catchy and it had epic ost. Overall it was a great anime just the story from episode 13-24 was a disappointment compared to how great it was in the episodes 1-12.\\n",

            "content": "Zetsuen no Tempest was one of the best animes I ever had the pleasure to watch, I loved it down to my very core and I can say it will definitely remain in my memory.\r\nThe story was grandly original and enjoyable, it circled around psychology and action in the best way possible. The whole plot started from the death of one girl, girlfriend and sister, resulting in the largest butterfly effect I ever watched in animes. The story has no certain villain, no white and black, it will make you question the characters' choices as you'll have no idea if they're fighting on the rightside. \\n\r\nThe art wasn't so astounding, pretty average (even tho all the characters were hot babes) but it didn't affect the anime, it was easy to overlook as it wasn't especially bad.\\n\r\nThe characters develop through the story, and have realistic attitudes and urges. They are very intelligent, there are some scenes in the anime where you will be mind-blown by their arguments and plans. All the characters fight for what they believe is right, which sometimes pulls them apart but makes it all the better when they reach a mutual conclusion.\\n\r\nOverall I'd say it's a must watch for all the action/psychology lovers out there.\\n",

            "content": "Well, this show can be described in one word: \"enjoyable\". It does what it sets out to do and does it with the minimum amount of competence that it needs to be enjoyable. I was surprised that I wasn't annoyed when I finished it. I fully expected this to do some things horribly wrong, but it didn't.\r\nThe art is rather nice, with some attention to detail. The sound is also enjoyable though nothing special.\r\nThe characters are well done, though nothing special: seems to be a reoccurring theme with this anime. The characters make sense in the context of the story, though their motivations and soon aren't really deep or anything, but the story didn't require them to be deep, so everything is fine. The story however tries to include some complex stuff: mind games, logical thinking and so on. When writing such a story you take the risk of messing up and breaking the immersion by having some kind of contradiction in the shows logic, but Zetsuen no Tempest handled that without messing up.\\n\\n\r\nUp until now I praised the show for being the minimum of what I consider enjoyable with some aces up it's sleeve, which would justify a 7/10 rating. What I am going to criticize will not lower the score, since i am mostly nitpicking.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest problem is, that everything feels constructed. The setup enables the story to be like that, but I have the feeling that that was just laziness from the writer of the original story. It is just a bitter aftertaste but nothing serious, because even though it feels constructed it isn't illogical.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion this anime does what it intended to do without insulting my intelligence or messing up along the way. If you are predisposed to watch this, then do so; If you are hesitant, try it out, but don't be afraid of dropping it.",

            "content": "STORY:\r\nIn most anime's it takes a few episodes to get into it, but Zetsuen no Tempest is actually pretty easy to follow. In the first few episode I was really curious to know who killed Mahiro's sister. I think that is the ONLY mystery of the whole serie. That was the only reason why I kept watching. The serie adds unrealistic aspects to the story (flying fruits, revival ceremony etc.). It's just 2 trees that are in war with eachother. The way the story is put together is not strong and not plausible. Therefore when I found out who killed Aika, I lost interest. Thekiller suposed to be the big twistplot, but it even made it more lame. Adding quotes of Shakespeare could be interesting but in this case it was getting more and more annoying. \\n\\n\r\nI did like how they potray Hakaze as a typical girl who is in love, and Mahiro as the typical guy who seeks revenge. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe summary made me curious, but it really was unrealistic. It reminds me of \"Mawaru Penguindrum\" where 2 guys fight for the sake of a girl and has a random element in it.  In this case the treemagic.  It's not worth the watch if you're looking for a good story.",

They turned it into a shounen love story.\r\nAlthough Yoshino's character was diversed and well-built; Hakaze's character was just as much clich\u00e9.\r\nOverall, I think something went wrong along the way and everything felt rushed.

            "content": "second anime review.\r\nlet's get started.\r\nStory (9/10)\r\n- Fuwa Aika has been mysteriously murdered. her brother , Fuwa Mahiro , is contacted by Kusaribe Hakaze ,  the leader of the Kusaribe clan who was left stranded on an unknown deserted island. She asks Mahiro for help and he says he helps her in exchange for her help to find out who killed her sister. Takigawa Yoshino , a friend of the Fuwas family , joins Mahiro , and then the action happens!!\r\n- this story is SO WELL developed. one thing that makes me love her even more, is all those Shakespeare quotes from Hamlet and TheTempest. just so good. \\n\r\n- i decided to watch this anime because i saw a post about it on the internet , and it seemed something i would really enjoy , so i just started watching , and then i just couldnt stop.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\r\n- this anime art it's just outstanding. on the very first episode , when i saw Yoshino , i kinda fell in love with him , because the art it's just so damn good , and that its one of the things that made continue watching the anime. but then when Mahiro showed up... oh lord!! NOSEBLEED! seriously. \\n\r\n- also the girls art is good. and the backgrounds , the magic stuff... outstanding art.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\n- i'm giving the sound a 9/10 because i didn't pay attention to the osts when i was watching it. but ive listened to all of the openings and endings , and i found it really really good. my favourite opening is the second one , it's just so calm , and relaxing. \\n\r\n- later i'm gonna look for the anime osts , but right now i don't know anything about it. really can't remember , i saw the anime 8 months ago , so xDD.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10)\\n\r\n- first of all I don't like Yoshino. I don't like Aika. I don't like Hakaze. \\n\r\n- I don't like Yoshino because he acts like a shitty boy. ok , i know (SPOILER ALERT) his girlfriend died , and that's obviously terrible , but he continues to say he has a girlfriend , and that she sends him messages and stuff , but , dude , she's dead! live with it. (i know it's hard ok , but i really can't stand Yoshino.)\\n\r\n- I don't like Hakaze because she just fell in love with Yoshino cuz he's the one who was always there for her. if it was Mahiro , she would fall for him. If it was other guy , she would fall for him. what a shitty attitude dude.\\n\r\n- I honestly don't know why i don't like Aika. i just dont. something on her face makes me think that she's not what we think she is. and also , she was dating Yoshino on her brothers back. i mean... that's stupid. her relashionship with Yoshino would obviously be standing still , even if Mahiro knew it!!!!!!\\n\r\n- I LOVE MAHIRO OK. FAV CHARACTER OF THE ANIME , ONE OF FAV CHARACTERS FROM ALL TIME!!! he's handsome , strong , cheeky , he wants revenge for the girl he (SPOILER) loved. i mean , everything about Mahiro is perfect. such a good character. his ending makes me sad.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\r\n- i really enjoyed watching the anime. i watched in 2 days , i think , and i cried on the last episode. don't know why , i just did. gonna re-watch it , as soons as i have time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\n- 9/10 because of Yoshino , Aika and Hakaze. if it weren't them , i'd give a 10/10. but also, if it weren't them , i would probably don't like the anime. \\n\\n\r\nthat's it.",

Oh, how wrong I was.\r\nStory 6/10:\r\nThe story is pretty much explained in the synopsis, so read it, if you'd like. The story when I started watching it felt really interesting, and it actually was (at the beginning). As the story moved on, it started becoming less interesting. You see, the anime pretty much became a slice of life anime with some supernatural elements like magic and the trees. Nothing really happened, just some talking, very little action and romance. That's what ruinedit for me. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe art was great. I don't think it was something extraordinary, but it was good enough. I usually give extra points to an anime that has well drawn faces. For some reason I can't look at badly drawn faces. This anime had well drawn faces. Which is good. The backgrounds were well detailed aswell.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes were good, but not exactly my taste. I ended up skipping them everytime I watched the episodes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nI liked most of the characters. Pretty much all of them had their own reason to keep moving forward and stay alive.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe story ended up ruining it for me. I pretty much forced myself to watch some of the episodes. I even skipped some. Probably because I prefer action instead of talking for like a whole episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10:\\n\\n\r\nAs you just probably read, the score was ruined thanks to the story for me. \\n\r\nThe anime wasn't all that bad though. I liked the first half quite a lot. \\n\\n\r\nThis was my first review ever, it's probably not the best, but I think I did a good job. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Zetsuen no Tempest is a perfect example of why I watch anime. It's a phenomenal representation of the medium, showing how deep and powerful the genre can be. As I review this, it has become my 2nd favorite anime of all time in a list surrounded by big names such as Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood and Steins;Gate. \r\nThe 1st thing worth noting starting off this review is how amazing this story is. It's the tale of two boys and their own specific journeys while they work together to save the world. Interestingly enough, while they do plan on saving the world, their motivations are much morepowerful than a generic anime hero's decision to protect everyone and is instead a display of how different people respond to the death of a loved one. At the same time, we're introduced to a girl, a mage and princess left in a barrel and sent to an island, who aids them from afar. This story is so unique while relying on the idea of tragedy, specifically Shakespeare's work.\\n\\n\r\nThe primary reason why I loved the story was how it played out. Nothing feels rushed, everything goes at a logical pace and the best part of the show is a 4 episode part in which the three protagonists and an enemy of theirs work to prove their respective hypotheses (That may sound like it'd be too wordy and boring but it is masterfully engaging). \\n\\n\r\nThe second aspect of the show which must be discussed is the characters which were some of the best I've seen from such a large cast since FMA Brotherhood. 1st We have Yoshino Takigawa, a quiet boy in high school who is seemingly not phased by anything. However behind this outward appearance is a damaged person trying to properly process the death of someone he loved. This approach to the character was very engaging to watch and I loved every second of his character arc, particularly the flashbacks he has. His dealing with grief is very real and sympathetic but by the end of the series, his growth is so measurable while not blatantly in the viewer's face. \\n\\n\r\nThe 2nd character to note is Mahiro Fuwa, an angry teenager given the ability to use magic from a mysterious princess and mage named Hakaze. His development is arguably just as strong as Yoshino's due to his very different handling of death. He seeks vengeance and holds resentment at the world for the loss of his beloved younger sister, going as far as to agree to help save the world with Hakaze in exchange for having the killer be found. This juxtaposition of vengeance alongside Yoshino's handling of grief really helps the viewer see these characters and their differences, making scenes with them interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOur 3rd and last main character I need to refer to is Hakaze Kusaribe. As previously mentioned, she is the infamous mage/princess left in a barrel and sent onto an island. She works as the \"odd-man out\" in the series by having her work with the other two who are so deeply connected, allowing for an outsider's perspective can be shown. She deeply cares for those around her and is driven by her morals, making her a very lovable female protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nOn a side note I'm going to make a comment that provides spoilers so skip ahead.\\n\\n\\n\r\n******SPOILERS******\\n\\n\r\nI loved the Yoshino and Hakaze pairing so much throughout the second half and am so glad they get together at the end. While I did like Yoshino and Aika together, I loved this pairing we got in the second half as well the message the show gave us: You have to move on. While Yoshino did love Aika, him living his entire life alone because of it is just too bitter an idea for me to swallow. The scenes with Yoshino and Hakaze were great and I'm glad that this show did not do one of the worst taboos in anime, where the other love interest gets screwed over and she's okay with it. Yoshino and Hakaze were a fantastic pairing and I was panicking with the amount of time left they had to put them together at that ending, I was so afraid nothing would happen but leave it to bones to save the day.\\n\\n\\n\r\n******END OF SPOILERS ******\\n\\n\\n\r\nI don't have much to say in terms of the Art and Sound. I'm giving them both a 10/10 because I loved the feel they both provided and how they worked with the story but I don't have anything I feel needs to be discussed.\\n\\n\r\nZetsuen no Tempest is a rare thing to see in recent anime: A well done story that does not allow for any cliches such as fan service or shounen action scenes to weigh down the narrative (granted you could argue the show has both but they are down appropriately and without being jarring when watching). Instead, we get a fantastic series that will go down in my memory as one of the greatest animes of all time.",

It's a story that often references Hamlet and The Tempest by William Shakespeare and keeps you guessing as to whether it will end in tragedy or not. The story is amazing and I couldn't have ever written a better storyline myself. The art is well-drawn but nothing quite as fancy as Black Rock Shooter or Bakemonogatari.  Character development is fantastic and you really get to know their personalities and their goals and desires. The romance is spoton without the harem aspect or too much fan service and is one of the better romance animes in my opinion. The action is pretty cool but not overboard. The only one thing I don't like about this anime is it tends to follow the overused Deus Ex Machina plot but this one is somewhat original enough to pass. I definitely recommend this show for those who love smart, deep storylines, good romance, and good action and magic.",

            "content": "\"Zetsuen no Tempest\" has currently been a fun ride- it's mysterious, engaging, and unique. \r\nThe first half of the story is focused mainly on four characters: Yoshino, Mahiro, Hakaze, and Samon. The story is set up in a way so the audience can't identify the main plot for the first several episodes. But the way this is done is perfect- it helps keep the viewer curious. \r\n[Story]\r\nThe two main characters, Yoshino and Mahiro, try to help the Princess of the Kusaribe clan, Hakaze, escape an island to which she was exiled to. Through objects called \"talismans\" they are able to communicate with Hakaze with thepower of magic. A member of the Kusaribe clan named \"Samon\" quickly finds out about their intentions to free Hakaze from the island and sends out his familiars to stop Yoshino and Mahiro. Samon sent Hakaze to the empty island due to a family disagreement about the revival of a omnipresent and omniscient entity, known as the \"Tree of Exodus\"- which can possibly and ultimately bring the downfall to humanity.\\n\\n\r\nMahiro's deal for helping Hakaze is that Hakaze will identify the killer of Mahiro's deceased sister- Aika, so Mahiro can exact revenge. Mahiro's best friend, Yoshino, agrees to help him on his journey. But when Samon's lackeys fail to stop the duo, Samon approaches Mahiro and Yoshino himself and persuades them to leave the site of the revival of the tree. Here's where several problems occur with the first half of the story...\\n\\n\r\n-The story drags on a bit too long here. Many flashback scenes about Aika, Yoshino and Mahiro, could have all been condensed into an episode or two.   \\n\r\n-Yoshino, Mahiro, and Samon discuss and argue for several episodes straight until the midway point of the anime. The first several episodes bring out fast-paced chases, fights, etc. But all of a sudden at some point there's a huge halt and from there the series begins to progress slowly. \\n\r\n-While some scenes were necessary, others were not.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the second half of the story is terrific, a new character is introduced, and past characters are being more involved in the plot. Enemies have become allies and the plot begins to pick up fast from here (there's even some romance). A lot of twists, reveals, and character development begin in the second half and it's great. The second half still focuses on one main thing- the reveal of Aika's killer- but it also begins to focus on the big picture. \\n\\n\r\n[Art and Sound]\\n\r\nI'll keep this part short and simple- the art is fantastic, all the characters are drawn well and the animating is perfect. Every character is eye-candy to one or another. The climatic effects are amazing and overall, there's nothing wrong here. \\n\r\nThe opening/endings are decent but nothing glorious. The sound effects are nice and Mahiro's voice actor portrays his character very well.  \\n\\n\r\n[Character] \\n\r\nYoshino is a rather bland character- although there is some character reveal about him later on in the series, he maintains a constant personality. He's a good guy, intelligent, and is kind but a bit boring for a main character. \\n\r\nMahiro, on the other hand, is brash, and also somewhat intelligent. Just like in Hamlet, Mahiro doesn't care what happens to the world as long as he gets his revenge. While his intentions are mostly straightforward, he's one of the more interesting characters in the show. He isn't complex, but he's usually calculating solutions and possibilities in his mind while Yoshino is also conjuring interesting thoughts, ideas, and some lies on his own. \\n\\n\r\nHakaze is smart, calculating, and confident. Eventually she develops a crush on Yoshino and although that's a bit unfortunate for her character, something like this has to happen in every anime. Samon is seen mostly as the antagonist for the first half, but is later revealed to be more of an antihero. He uses dirty tricks to do what he thinks must be done. Aika, is a character shrouded in mystery and is mostly seen through flashbacks. Although she remains a key point to the plot, her character still seems a bit insignificant in regards to the story- well, it seems so until you reach the start of the climax.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an action-packed anime, you're not going to find it here. The romance aspect is important in regards to several characters personalities, intentions, etc, but it is not the main focus of the show. But if you're into mystery animes, then this is for you. And like I said before, \"Zetsuen no Tempest has currently been a fun ride- it's mysterious, engaging, and unique.\" \\n\\n\r\nThe show IS mysterious. \\n\r\nIt IS engaging once you get into the plot. \\n\r\nAnd it IS definitely unique in a lot of aspects. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 8. \\n",

Yoshino and Fuwa Mahiro (his friend) unite due to magical circumstances, after Mahiro had been believed to be missing. The story does gain a bit of complexity with circumstances constantly changing and mysterious being unveiled. The main elements of mystery, drama, and action were all composed fantastically. The action scenes weren't repetitive, there were excellent scenes filled with emotion, and I have to say the initial mystery (the identity of Fuwa Aika'smurderer) was a big hook for me. Had a satisfactory ending, very little to be disappointed with.\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art style is a bit detailed and more realistic than your average anime. Not necessarily unique, but drawn well nonetheless. The art for characters is more or less irrelevant to the story. The characters don't have anything outlandish added to them, but they are unique to each other. The environments were also well done, nothing out of this world, but fitting for the character art and story.\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nI'm not one for noticing sound tracks while watching the anime, but I know that the music never took away from the story. In terms of voice acting, the voices matched the characters' personalities very well. For example, Mahiro is a hot-headed and outspoken character, so his voice is a bit deep for a teenage boy but loud when appropriate. Yoshino is more soft-spoken so his voice comes off as a little younger and is feels quiet on a base-volume level.\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe main characters were sort of exaggerated in terms of personality. Not by a crazy amount, but slightly so that they characters feel like they're cool. They had their strengths, but also their weaknesses which were both exposed. Although Fuwa Aika's weakness is a little less obvious, though it definitely exist. It's hard to say the characters grow, most of them instead show different sides of themselves. Yoshino and Kusaribe Hazake show the most evident growth. Each character had a great and sometimes relatable personality to them, this included the supporting characters.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI recommend this series if you like drama and psychological anime. I excluded action because I could have enjoyed this series if it was re-made without an action theme applied. It's not what you would call fast-paced necessarily, but it certainly isn't boring. There's always something new happening, but it's not rushed.The pacing of the story is excellent. I may re-watch this in the future, the story is so well put together that sitting through it is thrilling.",

            "content": "This show leads with a great premise and unique characters, but definitely wobbles in the second half. It doesn't quite fall on its face, though, and has a meaningful enough conclusion that it is worth a try. \r\nOne problem apparent here is that although they made the attempt, the action and the character drama aren't quite equally balanced. And some of that drama comes off as shallow: there's never a real moment of revelation that addresses the tangled web woven between the four main characters. A lot of the \"big moments\" in those story threads come when one of the people involved is out ofthe room. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the show has a lot of strong points. Animation is crisp and on-model throughout, with lots of attention paid to facial expression and use of color. The first half of the show is deliciously suspenseful, and the fight scenes are nothing to sneeze at. Big Bonus: none of these characters are a cliche. They are all well-conceived people who don't fall into easy categories (the naive newcomer, for example, is neither an idiot nor a total pushover). There is also a lot of subtle humor in this show, played out through comedic timing and the characters' own wit. That, at least, stays true until the end.\\n\\n\r\nDespite some plot holes and a weaker second half, this is a good series for anyone who enjoys character interaction, psychological intrigue, and references to classic literature, as well as a fairly uplifting ending.",

            "content": "Blast Of Tempest was created in the crux of Bones\u2019 downfall as a competent studio, so even though the show starts out as a polished Ufotable shounen with better pacing, it only takes a few hours for the polish to disappear and the entire show to collapse in its own confusion. It is common knowledge in the anime community that Bones lost steam after the reboot of Fullmetal Alchemist and has since been unable to reach the consistency of their previous quality when animating television shows. Blast Of Tempest, initially a big project for the studio and an anticipated show for seasonal viewers, left audiencessplit and cemented the struggle for animation company to regain their powerhouse status.\\n\\n\r\nThe show follows a couple of highschool friends, one of whom is dealing with the recent murder of his sister while the other is dealing with the recent death of his girlfriend. You can connect the dots. One of the friends miraculously gets in touch with a girl stranded on an island who calls herself the princess of Genesis, unveiling a hidden world of warring mages who worship the trees of Exodus and Genesis. The mages of Exodus are currently reviving their dead tree, posing a threat to humanity itself as entire city populations are mysteriously turning to iron mannequins, and the friends get mixed up in the power struggle between the two clans.\\n\\n\r\nFor a show aiming to present silly shounen fantasy nonsense like this in a more realistic, gritty light, Blast Of Tempest surprisingly makes it work well enough in the first act. Exposition unfolds in an engaging way as solid pacing and well-directed action suck the viewer in. The explanation of the supernatural elements is also fairly interesting, again, resembling a Ufotable Type/Moon work. Sky high production values and a good musical score created a cinematic treat as the anime began on a high note.\\n\\n\r\nAfter an hour, however, the show starts to lose momentum as we realize that the characters aren\u2019t interesting enough to carry the narrative. Developments in the story eventually converge and meet at a two hour scene in which the writers effectively dig their own graves, craft their own tombstones, and lay themselves down to be buried. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\\n\\n\r\nWhile a military assault is taking place on one of the magical trees, the two friends end up in a nearby forest where a rival mage meets up with them. He possesses the skeletal remains of their friendly stranded island mage who they\u2019ve had contact with the entire time, and reveals that he sent her back in time so that she wouldn't be involved in the war. What follows is a sprawling argument about what actually happened to the princess and the possibility of getting her off of the island and back to the present.\\n\\n\r\nAn immediate plothole can be found in the communication devices used by the friends and the princess, being two identical dolls that act as telephones (it\u2019s magic, don\u2019t question it). After establishing that the island itself isn\u2019t a bubble of altered time, it becomes impossible for the princess to send out her doll in a bottle, count four months on her side before establishing contact, while the protagonists find it and begin communication two years later. Another is established when the rival mage argues that the barrel in which the princess\u2019 current remains are held is the same as one on the island with her. After the friends tell the princess to carve something on the barrel to prove it, the barrel shows the carving in the present day as a pre-established marking. The simple solution to sabotage the show\u2019s logic on how the spacetime continuum works would be to make the princess carve more and watch the present barrel remain the same, but of course the show doesn't do that and ignores this inconsistency as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe enemy clan\u2019s motivations and use of magic from the other clans become virtually nonsensical during this time. Workarounds to the conundrum of the princess in the past, some of which would actually fix a poorly done script, are abandoned as pointless so that the show can carry out the intended problematic narrative. Eventually, the protagonists find a way to bring the princess back to the present by letting her resonate with her present remains, to which we question the powerful and knowledgeable mage of reasoning and logic as to why she didn\u2019t think of that valid solution earlier. All of these developments are completely spoonfed to the audience as though the show's weak plot twist was too much to handle, as characters stand frozen in position for the entire scene, only switching places quickly halfway through, all while the scene is sandwiched between minute long intervals of pointless flashbacks and the military battle going on next door. After two hours of this, the princess comes back to the present that she appeared to be in anyway, the annoying enemy mage feels incompetent, and an underwhelming midpoint finale comes and goes without our investment. A boring, pointless waste of time indeed.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the script shoots itself in the face with a gatling gun we still have five more hours to get through. One recap episode later and we find ourselves in a world where the tree of Genesis takes over, kills a ton of the world population, but at least things are peaceful for now. Firstly, the once great animation is reduced to completely regular visuals for a 2013 action anime. The continuing story becomes an utter bore, as main characters fall to usual tropes and side characters and villains form a commonplace protagonist group that lacks any personality or presence onscreen. The conflict between which magical tree to side with, once smartly left ambiguous, is rendered worthless as the writers lazily pick one tree as everyone\u2019s common enemy. If you can believe it, the semi-gritty magical battles are reduced to a sentai plotline that even Samurai Flamenco would point and laugh at while a complete stranger is brought in to be the deus ex miracle that fixes everything for a happy ending. \\n\\n\r\nDespite a near irredeemable downward spiral story structure, the show did retain a couple satisfying elements. One is the relationship between the main protagonist and the girlfriend, which felt original and unique. Both of them were very cynical around each other like they were stuck together and it felt more genuine than a generic romance that could have been written. Though the protagonist was a bore, the girlfriend had an aura of tranquility and wisdom that made her the most memorable character in the cast. The other is a fun second plot twist during the third act which was built up and executed much better than the show's first. Aside from these and the first few episodes that do well to pull viewers in right away, the negatives drag the anime so far down that it doesn't even attempt to climb back up in the end. \\n\\n\r\nTo close, the last thing to talk about is how Blast Of Tempest undeniably loves Shakespeare. Fans praise the anime because they say that it felt like one of Willy\u2019s works, although the only factors to support that conclusion are the constant verbalizations from the characters who draw parallels from their situation to Hamlet or The Tempest. Saying that your story is just like Shakespeare does not magically make your story Shakespearean, that\u2019s a no-brainer. Nowhere in this bombshell of a shounen turned sentai narrative are there thematic elements that warrant a legitimate comparison to William\u2019s work, and I suggest that fans look to Berserk for more fruitful inspiration from the playwright.\\n\\n\r\nBlast Of Tempest:\\n\r\n4/10",

            "content": "\"Just because it's illogical, that doesn't make it wrong.\" - Aika Fuwa\r\n\"To lose the woman you loved, not even being able to grieve\u2026 if not a tragedy, what is it?\"-  Hakaza Kusaribe\r\n\"Only sadness can counter sadness.\" - Mahiro Fuwa\r\n\"Tomorrow's promise will never come. I wonder how many of tomorrow's promises have disappeared as though they have never existed.\" - Yoshino Takigawa\r\nJust like a Shakespeare play, Zetsuen no Tempest (Blast of the Tempest/The Civilization Blaster) really goes deep in into the dialogues in a philosophical and psychological way. The quotes above are lines from the show, and really reflect each characters personalty and way ofthinking. Quotes from Shakespeare\u00b4s \"Hamlet\" and \"The Tempest\" are often used and discussed in the show. The story it self has close resemblance to these works as well, but in a very new and different way. Don\u00b4t take me wrong, this is very loosely based on mentioned works. I personally really enjoyed it, they mixed the old drama with a modern fantasy/magic story. And for the first time I really understood and appreciated some of Shakespeare\u00b4s work. The deeper meanings of his plays are brought in to the modern world in a very nice package. The plot may contain a revenge drama but that\u00b4s just a part of it. Much of the plot revolves around the magicians, and the God like trees and their will. What are they really? Will one bring destruction on the world or will the other? Must the old world get destroyed before a new can be born? Can one persons death give so big ripples that the worlds fate depends on it? I personally enjoyed the deep undertones of mystic and psychological input. This is not a lightweight show, it will demand some thinking and reasoning from your side. The aspects of the trees and magic around them remained me a little of \"The Avatar\" series which I enjoyed a lot. It gives the show a spiritual touch - how weapons are used as offerings to the tree in exchange for magical power was a very interesting idea. It makes one reflect on the current state of the world, and what would happen to the world if a giant tree popped up and started to absorb weapons and such to leave us with no tools to hurt each other with. Would a peaceful world without crime and war be worth the prize of a billion people? The show not only provide thought provoking themes with the drama, but also with the plot. The way the character used the quotes and how they debated, philosophized and argued about them, was very interesting and had many times a connection to the plot. Thanks to that I really started to get was these old dramas really was all about; loss, regret, anger, love, hope, numbness, strength, doubt, madness, despair, sadness, fate, acceptance, conclusion, helplessness and of course revenge - expressed in words very beautifully. \"Zetsuen no Tempest\" contain all these components and plays them out brilliantly in form of it\u00b4s characters and it\u00b4s story.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to the characters. They embody these feelings and emotions into their personalities and actions - this is how a great drama shall be done. I think it\u00b4s kind of bold to take Shakespeare\u00b4s work and making an anime like this, but for me it was a slam-and-dunk. The main characters are really something else in this show. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u00b4s start with Mahiro for example - He has an arrogant and nonchalant personality, and when faced with the murder/loss of his sister he broke down. He was left with regret, anger and hate. And of course those feelings lead to a desire for revenge. Other when those feelings Mahiro becomes emotionally numb. He doesn\u00b4t care what he has to do get his revenge - even if he has to become  merciless. And all that feels believable when delivered as it done in \"Zetsuen\". Because Mahiro isn\u00b4t a static character, his character develops a lot during the show. Aika is technically dead throughout the whole show, but are a main character (if not \"THE\" main character) with a lot of influence on the plot and all the other characters. She is a very odd and serious 15-year old. She only reads Shakespeare and love to quote them - but almost always from just \"Hamlet\" and \"The Tempest\". She always use them to make philosophical point - she has a tremendous influence over Mahiro and Yoshino. Akia gives away a aura of calm acceptance - it\u00b4s like nothing can disturb her emotionally. The origin of this this calm acceptance is one of the mystical tones \"Zetsuen\" has. Yoshino is a very intelligent, shy and kind person, and after his secret girlfriend Akia\u00b4s death he becomes trapped in a void of numb acceptance. He can\u00b4t grieve his lost love openly, and suffers in silence. Yoshino is a very mysterious character, because he never seem faced by anything around him how horrible then it may be. It\u00b4s like something died inside him then Aika died. He doesn\u00b4t see the point in taking revenge - the dead is dead and can never come back. This leads to many heated discussions with Mahiro. And just like Mahiro, Yoshino isn\u00b4t a static character - he also develop nicely and have some of the shows strongest emotional moments. Hakaze is very confident young woman with eminence powers - she\u00b4s a magician with a huge responsibility on her shoulders. She\u00b4s a leader and a princess out in her fingertips, and are seldom doubting her self. But fate has a pretty ruff path layed out for her - she has to face many challenges and falls into despair. Her interactions with Yoshino is able her to find new strength. I really enjoyed her stoic and intelligent personality. Even during her short kudare phase she was able to analyze things in a very self sacrificing and objective way. She embodies the word straight forward in a refreshing way.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the side characters they all have a part to play, but after amazing entrances they do not develop much at all. They are for shore not boring, but so much more could had been done with them. I would have liked to see them in more personally situations, and seen them interact more with each other and the main character in the same way. Because the main characters was so strong, more had to be done with them to make them really shine. This is just a thought due, so don\u00b4t mined this to much. It definitely doesn\u00b4t ruin the show in any way.   \\n\\n\r\n\"Zetsuen\" is produced by studio Bones, and the art animation is outstanding. It\u00b4s almost flawless. Character designs is great - it\u00b4s towards the pretty corner but done very nicely. The thing that stood out was the characters eyes. The way they could express 100s of emotions just with their eyes is masterly done. It suite the dramatic theme like a hand in a glove. The backgrounds are almost life like - we are getting gorgeous sun settings, after noon lights in a park, city silhouettes, and fields on the country side. Everything is breathtakingly beautiful. The motions of the characters are smooth and fluid, without any hint of jerkiness. The coloration and light setting are always on spot. Really a visual masterpiece. The magic scenes are fantastic - with light and colors that really giving the magic  life. And the action scenes - most of them is masterpieces in them self. Fluid motions, nice angles and badass techniques. They are slowed down and speed up in just the right moments. Some of them are the best I seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe music used for this show was absolutely wonderful. Intense violins and dramatic classical music really lifted \"Zetsuen\" to the heights. The tension in the scenes sky rockets with the well suited soundtrack. The show has often a heavy and dramatic feeling to it, and the soundtrack really brings that out in full potential. I will listen to this a very long time. I watched subbed and man did the VA\u00b4s do a fantastic job. Not only did they bring the characters to life but they were the characters. Absolutely amazing. They managed to bring out the essence of the character, and their voices suited their characters very well. I liked both OP\u00b4s but the first one I thought suited the show more. Both was fast going but the first one had a bit darker feeling to it. It\u00b4s was really good - I always took the time to watch that one. The ED\u00b4s are of the slower sad kind. Both suiting both nothing prize worthy. \\n\\n\r\n\"Zetsuen\" has one of the strongest opening episodes I ever encountered, it really caught me of guard. It made the promise that the show would be great, and it held that promise to me. Some small things just made it out of a masterpiece for me, but I\u00b4m truly happy with the show. It\u00b4had me interested, invested, intrigued, exited and awed. The Shakespeare influences was done very well in my opinion, and brought the old classical dramas in to this century in an intersecting way. I enjoyed \"Zetsuen\" a hell of a lot, and the strong and impactful characters is gonna stay in my memories for a long time. If you ever lost someone close to you or know someone that has, much of the emotions and actions the character feel or do makes perfect sense. The loss of the person that you loved the most can really break a person - and how can one fined meaning in a world that don\u00b4t make sense. That journey is a very relatable one, and I think the show portrays this very well. From start to end - all the emotions that makes up such a journey are there in the show. I will for shore rewatch this time to time, I believe I will fined new details every time. The fantastic story, explosive characters, brilliant animation together with a wonderful soundtrack truly makes this show great in my eyes. \\n",

            "content": "The moment I caught sight of this anime title, \"Zetsuen no Tempest\", I knew that it was an anime I could not miss. I was not mistaken.\r\nIf I could compare ZnT to a graph, I would say it is best described as a sin curve ranging from 0 to pi(n-shaped). It gets off to a slow start, and may leave you wondering whether to just drop it after the first episode. Well, I'm saying it now, don't. That's going to be a big mistake. Our pair of young male protagonists at first glance appears to be two idiots who are slightly damaged in the head,with one guy making infrequent declarations of vengeance and the other guy who shows no sign of surprise/emotion upon seeing his fellow students turned into inanimate black metal. Well, I'll be damned, but this was in fact all planned.\\n\\n\r\nAfterward, we are introduced to a clan of magic-wielders known as the Kusaribe clan. One faction comprises Samon and majority of the clan, the other faction is Princess Hakaze, the fiery clan leader who was trapped by Samon on an isolated island, and our two male protagonists, whose help she had recruited. From then onward, the story picked up and the action escalated as the conflict between the two sides increased, with both sides running out of time. The mystery thickened, the atmosphere got heavier, and the tension was palpable as the two sides faced off. Now we gradually come to the realization that in fact the initial impression of the protagonists were exactly planned to pique our curiosity. Why are these two guys like that? What happened in their past? With us the viewers dying to know in front of the screen, the director could be aptly described as a skillful conductor, controlling the flow of the music to  be sometimes slow and methodical, other times furious and powerful, yet always tantalizing. Combine the intriguing story with the intelligent action sequences(sorry to disappoint, shounen fans, this is not your run-of-the-mill \"it's over 9000!!\" let's-see-who-can-summon-larger-fireballs kind of fights), and Bones living up to their reputation for quality animation, and I dare say that the anime is every bit as good as the Shakespearean plays it pays tribute to.\\n\\n\r\nWith a catch, of course. That's only for the first half. In the second half of the anime, things sort of dwindle down and become less interesting. As conflicts resolve and the mystery becomes clear, so too does the tension and force that contributed to the impact of the first half. Not only that, we get introduced to another character who plays an important role but is far more annoying, idiotic, and shounen-ish than the two protagonists. Well, I suppose the message that power and responsibility are sometimes forced upon us was made pretty clear. In the end, the last 2 or 3 episodes were pretty predictable and became somewhat of a drag to me.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all though, if you have a taste for intrigue, mystery, action, and appreciate attention to details, ZnT is an anime you should not miss.(Overall 8.5)",

If you can't tell, then I'll come right out and say it. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS ANIME!\r\nAgain, me and these trivial love stories always have the power to take over my life. \r\nYou don't need to love Shakespeare's works of literature to enjoy this anime, though I must say, if you can pinpoint or predict certain parts in  the plot as i could it does wonders for your ego. \r\nTheanime styling is very sharp! quite amazing. The music of choice is halfway between classical and pop I would say and for the most part with a higher pitch to add to the suspense. if you cant read a clock then maybe this show is not for you (kidding, you'll understand when you watch the series.) knowledge of the grandfather clock effect will help. One thing that i must share, however, is that im sure that after you watch this series you will feel as though this series expresses and portrays a more realistic and relatable love/ relationship. \\n\\n\r\nMUST WATCH\\n\\n\r\nHope you enjoy.",

            "content": "Summary: Zetsuen no Tempest is an anime that starts out with some great build-up in the first half of the show, only to fall completely on its face during the second half. Nevertheless, the anime is good enough to warrant a watch.\r\nLonger review:\r\nStory/Plot\r\nThey should\u2019ve called this anime \u2018Plot Twist Mania\u2019.\r\nThe plot has so many twists and turns that it\u2019s almost impossible to predict what\u2019s going to happen, at least for the first half of the show. After that, however, you come to expect the twists, to the point where they either become (even more) nonsensical or even predictable. So nonsensical, in fact, that at somepoint, the anime just literally gives up and goes: 'Aliens. It was aliens'.\\n\\n\r\nThis show suffers from something I like to call \u2018Sword Art Online Disease\u2019, where the second half of the series is so vastly different in setting and tone than the first half that it becomes inferior to the first half of the series. Though this case is not as bad as Sword Art Online\u2019s was (that second half was unwatchable), this one is not all that great, either.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the first half of the show we are presented to a world of magic that\u2019s, quite frankly, awesome. The idea for the apocalypse (the world\u2019s logic will be erased), is very original. It has this very nice air of mystery and misery around it, which I really love. The plot was solid, even if the pay-off was a little too much talking and not enough showing. \\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the show goes for a much lighter tone. Both the characters and the plot were heavily simplified and it just didn\u2019t sit well with me. You had such an awesome buildup to just... kinda fall flat.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the second half, the story was reduced from a good to a mediocre one. Still, it's servicable, as long as you ignore the insane plottwists (ALIENS!).\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked about the characters, at least during the first half of the show, was that there weren\u2019t really any stereotypes in the cast. At least, not the stereotypes you usually see.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is Takigawa Yoshino. Yoshino was introduced as a sort toned down version of Shiroe from Log Horizon \u2013 a guy who is, generally, nice, but will not hesitate to choose the most effective way of executing his plans, even if it\u2019s the most brutal one. He\u2019s very smart and has this air mystery~ around him. There were constantly hints that he was actually not as nice as he looked and acted, but the show never really showed that darker side of him, which just kind of annoyed me. \\n\\n\r\nThe second main character is Fuwa Mahiro. He is, no other way to describe it, a fucking badass. He is very much the anti-hero of this show \u2013 he doesn\u2019t care what happens to him, his friends, or even the world, as long as he gets to have revenge for his sister. And he\u2019s not just all bark, too, he also has the strength and wits to back him up. He is very impulsive, though, which brings him into trouble quite a lot. \\n\\n\r\nThe third and last (living) main character is Hakaze. Hakaze is the princess of the Kusaribe Clan and also the strongest mage on this planet. Even though they could\u2019ve easily turned her into just fanservice (she still kind of is, to be honest), or even a damsel in distress, the show decides to actually show her some respect. Hakaze is a stubborn mage who does not let anyone tell her what to do. Even after basically being rendered useless on an island, she refuses to back off and does what she can to continue thwarting the Tree of Exodus and Samon. She had the potential to be the strongest female character I\u2019ve seen in a long time...\\n\\n\r\n...and then the second half came around.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the second half of the show, all coolness just seemed to be sucked out of the characters. Yoshino becomes some sort of fish (not kidding, that\u2019s his expression most of the time), Mahiro\u2019s presence becomes heavily toned down and he almost does a one-eighty character flip and Hakaze is reduced to a motherfucking tsundere. A. Motherfucking. TSUNDERE!! The most overused trope in all of anime, this amazing character is reduced to the most overused trope in anime! \\n\\n\r\nIt really annoys me, since all these characters had so much potential and it just lays there now, unused, and just... ARGH!\\n\\n\r\n*deep breath*\\n\\n\r\nOkay. Moving on.\\n\\n\r\nThe only character I had a problem with before the second half rolled around was Aika. Fuwa Aika is Mahiro\u2019s sister WHO IS NOT RELATED BY BLOOD (we all know where this is going *sigh*) and seems to speak in exposition or something. Even though she is dead by the time the show starts, we constantly get flashbacks to her from both Yoshino and Mahiro, who both make her out to be some sort of angel (even if they deny it). She really doesn\u2019t have much of a character outside of being the biggest Mary Sue I\u2019ve seen in a long time before, ironically, the second half.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the second half is where the show takes a nosedive, it seems to lift Aika into the air. She actually becomes pretty interesting and, since we get to see her from someone else\u2019s perspective then the two guys that are in love with her, she gets a much more nuanciated image. It\u2019s still not enough to make up for constantly speaking in exposition, though. Seriously, it\u2019s annoying. Nobody talks like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe minor characters are probably my favorite thing, though. And then especially the antagonists (for the first half, naturally). The reason for that is that they are human. \\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the side characters are, in reality, very weak and prone to panic. Especially the main villain, Samon, is like this. Normally, I would bash this and call them bad villains, but this time, it\u2019s not like that. What makes them good villains is that the show doesn\u2019t even try to make them threatening. They portray them as humans with human emotions and human mistakes. They\u2019re honestly doing what they think is best, and have very good reasons for it. They don\u2019t like what they\u2019re doing, but do it nonetheless, without the obligatory \u2018Should I shouldn\u2019t I\u2019 moment most villains have. This is something I like \u2013 a lot. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the characters had a lot of potential, but fell flat on their face in the execution of that potential. Which saddens me, because I\u2019d honestly want to see them in their full-fledged form.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nThe animation looks AMAZING. Especially the magic looks beautiful, both in design and movement. It\u2019s very traditional, yet has a fresh air around it. The rest of the fight scenes are also very well executed and look solid. The only exception to this are the fight scenes between trees, but that\u2019s not necessarily because the animation is bad, but more because they\u2019re... well... trees fighting. Come on. I cannot take that seriously. \\n\\n\r\nI also love the art. It has a lot of dark shades in the first half of the show, yet also manages to make the colors stand out perfectly. I like it.\\n\\n\r\nSummary: the animation is Bones. Of course it\u2019s good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is beautiful on its own, but sometimes it tries to overshadow the animation/story, which I don\u2019t like. With the existence of the first opening this is all forgiven, though, as it is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that bothers me a bit is the voice actor for Tetsuma. His voice just sounds unnatural with the character design. Later on in the series, this stopped bothering me though, probably because I just got used to it.\\n\\n\r\nAl in all, despite some minor annoyances, the sound/music department is solid.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nZestuen no Tempest was an anime that had a lot of potential, but due to some problems in the second half, ended up neglecting most of that potential. This saddens me, for it could\u2019ve been a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nStill, though, as I begrudingly admit, this anime is solid. The first half is absolutely amazing, and even if the second half falls flat in comparison to the first, it still has some solid characters and plotlines. If that had been an anime on its own, I probably wouldn\u2019t have had much of a problem with it, it\u2019s more because the first half is so awesome that it irritates me. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this anime is at least worth a watch. \\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a 7.4 out of 10.\\n",

Although other anime also have similarly complicated and/or messed up characters, Zetsuen no Tempest is basically centered around these almost incomprehensibly complex characters. Because these characters are so layered and complicated, unraveling each desire/dream/etc. provides great interest and satisfaction for the viewer.",

It is a list of why I think Zetsuen no Tempest was a masterpiece.\r\nHeavy Spoiler Warning\r\nI love Zetsuen no Tempest, I rank it #1 of my favorite Overall Anime list. This is because I really enjoyed this anime within these reasons. \r\n#1) The background story of a dead girlfriend made it a great romance emotional story. \r\n#2) The incorporation of Shakespeare's Tempest and Hamlet gives the anime a different connotation that respected old values unlike other anime. \r\n#3) This anime did not focus on the ecchi but really took the time todevelop a story. This I respect a lot because there are not a lot of anime which does this.\\n\r\n#4) The suspense of Yoshino revealing his girlfriend was so heart-beating I almost couldn't breathe. \\n\r\n#5) Fuwa Aika is probably the best anime girlfriend there is for me because I am greatly attracted into her philosophy, she is smart, and she is those girls who can never misunderstand her boyfriend.\\n\r\n#6) Zetsuen no Tempest covers almost every genre there exist. It is an anime that fits both genders (shounen and shojo).\\n\r\n#7) The ending was perfect, I cried at the end with Fuwa Aika's final message to Yoshino and Mahiro with the OST Reminiscence played in the background. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I love Zetsuen no Tempest for being different than other anime. It is an anime who I believe the director, author, and staff put a lot of time an effort to make this anime as dramatic, heart beating, suspenseful, and sad as it is. I cannot thank the staff members enough for making such a masterpiece. Please continue to put the aspects of these anime into your future productions. Thank you so much!!\\n\\n\r\nPS: For episodes 8-12, Masahiro Ando, you did a great job making those episodes not boring. To be honest those were the most interesting episodes and made me like Yoshino and realize that he is a moral strategist. Those episodes were so interesting that I did not realize they were just standing and talking.\\n",

            "content": "Story: The beginning of the story is about a mage chick named Hakaze who gets stranded on an island. She employs the help of two friends, Mahiro and Yoshino, and communicates with them via magic, voodoo-doll walkie-talkies. Mahiro\u2019s motive for helping is to find the person who killed his younger sister, Aika. While Yoshino, Aika\u2019s secret boyfriend, just kinda wants to tag along. The main goal of their adventure is to stop the awakening of a terribly destructive tree god. The series is also extremely flashback-heavy and details Mahiro/Yoshino\u2019s friendship and the secret relationship Yoshino had with Aika.\r\nThe story didn\u2019t grab me. Whenit came down to it, the main bad guy was a tree and the two main protagonists spend the entire anime moping. Come on, we all know how annoying it is to be around someone who can\u2019t get over an ex. Now multiply that by two and put them together. The series as a whole lacked action and urgency. After Episode 12 I really lost sight of what the hell everyone was trying to do. They basically took a hiatus from the plot. This was used to develop a one-sided romance, answer a few questions about people\u2019s pasts and introduce a couple new characters that I didn\u2019t care about. I\u2019m sorry, but if you want to build a murder mystery into the plot that\u2019s great but don\u2019t put the whole plot on hold to do it. Literally billions of people are dying, cities are being destroyed, and we are getting worked up about 1 girl\u2019s death? Some perspective please.\\n\\n\r\nOn the topic of Aika and the murder mystery they kind of messed that part up. First, they spent way too much time focusing on it. By about episode 14 I had heard enough about Aika and by episode 17 I was becoming progressively more nauseated with every sentimental flashback. As for the actual mystery and suspense part they built an intriguing story only to knock it down with a weird, irrational twist.\\n\r\nI think the only part of this anime that really stood out was when we find out the \u2018who/what/when/where/why/how\u2019 about how Hazake got stranded. It was actually really well done and could have been a great springboard for Yoshino\u2019s character. Unfortunately the story flopped on its belly after that and those few episodes were as good as it got.\\n\\n\r\nI think anime can be a tool to address philosophical questions, realities of human nature, moral truths etc.. Tempest has a lot of fatalistic themes built into it which I don\u2019t\u2019 mind but they didn\u2019t do it well. I finished the series feeling like there was some vague attempt at a deeper message but ultimately I was unsure of what they were trying to convey. By the end I was just irritated at the characters I was supposed to care about.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nI don\u2019t know anything about Japanese courtship but god damn those teens were passive aggressive. Sneaking around, setting up fake encounters, pretending to hate one another to throw people off. It\u2019s like an unspoken rule that you can\u2019t just sit down and talk about a problem you have to put it off and hide it until it explodes. I guess it made the love triangle entertaining but it also made the dilemmas difficult to relate to and the characters difficult to admire. \\n\\n\r\nThe way the characters reacted to emotional situations seemed abnormal and very blunted. Yoshino\u2019s reactions and thought process remained super passive and detached. Many characters were either 1 dimensional or inconsistent. By the end of the series I didn\u2019t know what Yoshino stood for or why. Btw, if you watch this anime, keep an eye out for the \u2018video message\u2019, I found it to be a lot more creepy than touching. Who the fuck would get turned on by that? \\n\\n\r\nAs a general rule, characters should behave rationally and in their own best interests or according to their ideals. If they're going take the painful or difficult path it should be because there is no easier or simpler option. That's just good writing. You create a plot hole when the audience can think of a much simpler solution to a problem the protagonists are struggling with. Needless self-sacrifice makes for cheap emotional porn. I loved LotR. It was an epic trilogy, full of amazing battles, struggles and sacrifices but why couldn\u2019t the eagles have just dropped the ring in Mt Doom from the start? Tempest is full of shit like that cept without the epicness.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: Extremely good art. I need to say it. I need to mention Yoshino's character design. He is one of the most feminine looking male character I\u2019ve seen. He has a pixie haircut and wears hairclips. I kept mistaking him for a girl. You can take that information however you want.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The intros were mediocre but the music was very good and helped create a sad and haunting atmosphere.\\n\r\nOverall: Not wowed. The murder mystery was kind of a flop for me. The action was average at best. The story left many unanswered questions. The characters were inconsistent.\\n\\n\r\nLove/Romance: They love a dead girl. There\u2019s some stuff on the side that\u2019s pretty awkwardly done and completely one-sided.\\n\r\nBlood/Gore: Not too much actually.\\n\r\nSex/Nudity: A bit of fan service and cleavage.\\n",

            "content": "About the STORY\r\nIt\u2019s different in a sense of how the flow of story is done! It\u2019s definitely not the typical or traditional way of storytelling. Not to mention that the first half is kind of in the heavy side and the second half is lighter. But it is also true that the first half is a lot more exciting than the second part where there are more flashbacks. One of the most interesting parts of the series is the monologues particularly from Hamlet and The Tempest by William Shakespeare. And the bad side is, the series\u2019 storyline might become too boring for some who prefermore action than talking as there are countless moments for arguments or showdown of reasoning rather than something really happening.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nThe two main characters are like combinations of the typical characteristics of shounen series protagonists; one is physically strong type character and the other is the smart type which makes their tandem great for the type of the story the series has. It\u2019s interesting that a dead character can manipulate the story so much. And almost all the characters have interesting roles which is quite rare as there are countless of series with huge number of forgettable characters.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION\\n\r\nAs one of the latest series of today, it\u2019s really a great thing that the animation, particularly the action, is leveled up. There\u2019s amazing details in the fight scenes which makes it even cooler and exciting. Plus, the character\u2019s design is also something to look forward to.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ENJOYMENT\\n\r\n For someone who loves literature like myself; having Hamlet and The Tempest as the basis for the story is really amazing. It is no doubt one of the most exciting series of today but that is mostly from the first part and some in the ending. However, the start of the second part gradually makes it less and less interesting and exciting. It is more of the comical approach which is so different from how it started. Nevertheless, I still feel contented. it still definitely left an impression with me.\\n",

            "content": "*Note to readers, this is my FIRST review, so please, grant me some leeway.*\r\n**There will be very heavy spoilers so please take heed!**\r\nBefore I begin my tentative first review, I would like to say that as a huge anime fan and veteran watcher, very few series have given me an exhilarating and intriguing experience as Zetsuen no Tempest.  Now obviously, as Zetsuen no Tempest is Shounen in nature, it's target demographic is a very large, young male and teenage audience, and as one such male teen myself, that indubitably has influenced my perception of this series.  Also, Zetsuen no Tempest is heavily influencedby William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" and \"The Tempest\" and having read both plays, my perception and reception of this series will be further biased towards one view.  Nevertheless, despite these permeating factors, Zetsuen no Tempest, in my opinion, is one series that can appeal to any type of audience due to its eclectic range of themes, concepts, and perhaps most importantly, conflicts.  In this review, I will examine each of the core aspects of this series and further extrapolate the art and complex narrative that arises from their cohesion.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\n*Heavy spoilers in this section.*\\n\\n\r\n**This is my longest section; I assure you, the other sections are nowhere near as long.**\\n\\n\r\nLike \"Hamlet\" and \"The Tempest,\" Zetsuen no Tempest is a story of revenge set in a world where magic exists.  Like Hamlet and Prospero, in the first half of the series, one of the main protagonists goes on a quest for revenge: a quest to find and take vengeance upon the person who killed his sister.  Whilst on his quest, he and his friend (the other main protagonist) see that the world is crumbling around them and that people are turning to stone in cities.  During their journey, they question the irrationality and the (sometimes lack of) logic of the world several times: Why did my sister have to be killed?  Why is the world like this?  Question like these force the audience to reexamine themselves and the world they live in; to question justice and nature and how illogical the world they inhabit can be.  The logic of the world is governed by the Tree of Genesis, and the Kusaribe clan, the clan that can use magic in Zetsuen no Tempest, is responsible for guarding it.  By contrast, the Tree of Exodus is said to oppose the logic of the world and will be responsible for bringing about its destruction.  Here, the theme of duality is emphasized: Genesis vs. Exodus, Logic vs. Irrationality, etc.  Similarly, throughout the series, flashbacks go back to the main protagonist's sister who always quotes from \"Hamlet\" and \"The Tempest\" when speaking with him or the other main protagonist.  In those flashbacks, we also see the theme of duality emphasized in the juxtaposition of both of Shakespeare's plays: \"Hamlet\" is a tragedy where the main characters, save Horatio, die in the end, whereas \"The Tempest\" is a happy story where Prospero rightfully reclaims the throne from Alfonso, with no deaths occurring in the end.  The theme of duality present in the series is perhaps the most important one as it plays an integral role in the second half of the series which I will explain in my next paragraph.\\n\\n\r\nThe story then takes a shift in tone and style with the second half of the series.  The first half focuses on adventure, and fighting, whereas the second half takes a more light-hearted, slice of life style.  In the second half, the Tree of Genesis has emerged and has ended most of the world's problems: famines have been eliminated, no more wars, no diseases, etc.  However, at the same time, the Tree of Exodus has started to grow and has chosen a Mage of Exodus to be its avatar.  In the later parts of the second half, the truth behind Aika's death is revealed and that the Tree of Genesis is what would truly bring about the end of the world and that the Tree of Exodus has the power to stop it.  With this revelation, the Kusaribe clan and the main characters realize that just blindly following what they were told and just following old traditions would have led to their doom.  In this sense, Samon, who advocated for the resurrection of the Tree of Exodus, actually served as the true voice of reason and free will after the fact.  In the end, the Tree of Genesis is destroyed and humanity is back to where it started before with the problems plaguing it before now returned.  \\n\\n\r\nThe main thing to garner from the story is the concept of duality.  Duality is seen in the conflict between the two trees, the endings of both of Shakespeare's plays that are referenced heavily, determinism and free will, etc.  While Aika's death in and of itself is a tragedy that draws parallel with the deaths of the characters in \"Hamlet,\" the ending of Zetsuen no Tempest is one of happiness and freedom that parallels with \"The Tempest\": a world no longer ruled by the Tree of Genesis and where humanity can walk and think on its own feet.  Undoubtedly, the beginning of the story can seem crazy and confusing and too scattered to understand at first, but as one continues experiencing the wild ride of Zetsuen no Tempest, one will begin to connect all the pieces and see how everything comes together beautifully in the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was very good in my opinion, especially the artwork done for the magic and the talismans; nothing was too out of control or ridiculous.  My only complaint is the use of CGI for the Tree of Genesis and the Tree of Exodus (I dislike CGI and personally believe that it should not be used in anime, but again, that is my preference).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe two opening themes use for Zetsuen no Tempest are simply amazing and the background music perfectly conveys the emotions of the characters and the setting of the story at the perfect times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\n*Heavy spoilers in this section.*\\n\\n\r\nWhat would Zetsuen no Tempest be without its characters?  For the characters are the ones who define and shape this tragic, and eventually, beautiful story.\\n\\n\r\nYoshino Takigawa: Yoshino essentially serves as the focal point of the mystery and tragedy surrounding Aika's death.  Throughout the story, he exhibits his shrewd and calculating personality to handle the situations that obstruct him and Mahiro.  Consequently, as someone with a calculating and calm demeanor, Mahiro is shown to be very indifferent to his situations at times and can even some cold or callous.  He always argues the most rational and logical decisions and this has shown to work to his advantage when he argues with Samon.  However, though pragmatic in nature, Mahiro comes off as cold and eventually, he learns that what is most logical isn't necessarily what's right.\\n\\n\r\nMahiro Fuwa: The revenged-obsessed brother who goes on his quest solely to find his sister's killer.  At first, his character reminded me of Sasuke's and it's because of this initial thought that I had low expectation for Zetsuen no Tempest at first.  Mahiro exhibits a strong tunnel vision: he's so focused on his goal of revenge that he could not care less about the world in its degrading state.  However, after he learns the truth about his sister's death, he loses his desire for vengeance and starts to think for himself.  The shift that occurs when Mahiro learns the truth is also a symbolic truth in the story: the story will have the happy ending of \"The Tempest\" that Aika wanted rather than the sad ending of \"Hamlet.\"\\n\\n\r\nHakaze Kusaribe: She is the princess of the Kusaribe clan who is stranded on a deserted island and is the clan's most powerful magic user.  She is protected by the logic of the Tree of Genesis and is given the duty of protecting and nurturing it.  In the first half of the series, she serves as a direct antithesis to Samon who supports the resurrection of the Tree of Exodus and their conflicting ideals of which tree will lead to creation and destruction adds to the theme of duality heavily ingrained throughout the series.  In the second half, Hakaze serves a more comedic and SoL role as a potential love interest for Yoshino.\\n\\n\r\nSamon Kusaribe; A member of the Kusaribe clan who advocates for the resurrection of the Tree of Exodus to protect the world.  As he believes that the Tree of Genesis will destroy the world, he serves as the direct contrast in both methods and ideals to Hakaze, who is given the duty of protecting the Tree of Genesis.  While Hakaze embodies the clan's traditions and beliefs, Samon is more liberal and believes that simply following the traditions of the clan would doom them and the world.  The contrast between Hakaze and Samon sets up the historical dichotomy of determinism and free will, which plays a significant role in the second half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAika Fuwa: Mahiro's sister who turns out to be the Mage of Exodus and it is revealed that is the one who murders herself.  Because the Tree of Genesis would respond aggressively to the Mage of Exodus, Aika resolves to kill herself to protect the world.  Here, the question asked is whether or not Aika's death was avoidable: was her death predetermined or did she truly choose to kill herself to protect the world from the Tree of Genesis?  The ambiguity of this question and her suicidal action further enhances the concept of duality in the second half of the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis one is self-explanatory.  ;)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Zetsuen no Tempest takes what is seemingly an irrational and illogical series with a typical theme of revenge and meshes everything together in what comes out to be a beautiful and cohesive whole.  \\n\\n\r\nMy recommendation is: whether you are new to anime or a veteran watcher, Zetsuen no Tempest will give you a profound and satisfying experience that you will surely enjoy and remember.\\n",

            "content": "I don't know why I didn't watch this anime sooner. How can an anime of this caliber go right under my radar while a bunch of crappy popular anime constantly grab my attention?\r\nArt\r\nThe art was very nice. Some scenes were animated a little oddly or plainly but overall it was very well-animated. As for character design, at first I wasn't a fan but it grew on me, especially the clothing. The clothing really grabbed my attention, especially the shoes. Mahiro's and Yoshino's shoes in the first half of the anime are amazing. Mahiro's shoes in the second half are great as well. Both of theiroutfits in the first half were overall pretty great.  I usually don't care about clothing, let alone shoes, but in this case both really caught my eye.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the main characters I really didn't care about the character designs of anyone else actually. They were fine but nothing extraordinary.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was great. Sometimes the soundtracks of other anime are so average I never notice them, but in the case of this anime the soundtrack was great. While a few  songs were played one too many times, they were still very good songs on their own. The songs also really fit with the constant quoting of Shakespeare. It was nice. Along with the art, the music created a fantastic ambiance.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were very well done. I love the two main characters. From the first episode you already have a great idea about what they are about, and within the next few you pretty much understand them. From that point on you learn new and surprising things about them as the anime goes on.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime also did a good job with the villains, as there really were no true villains. Villains that are realistic with their motives and actions always make a great show.\\n\\n\r\nThere were a bunch of random side characters though that I couldn't care less about. Especially the government characters. They did nothing for me and basically every time they appeared I'd skip over their parts. But they barley showed up so it was alright. They were just very pointless in my opinion and I didn't quite understand why they existed.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThe story was very well done. The plot sucked me in from the start, though it was a bit slow at the beginning of episode one. But for me to watch a whole first episode of an anime without skipping around is already something to be congratulated on. I am very impatient. Around the end of episode one I was already clicking on episode two. By the time episode two ended I didn't even remember clicking on episode three.\\n\\n\r\nBut there are some problems with the story. There are inconsistencies and contrivances here and there. There were big decisions and plot points made that were utterly forgotten about within the next episode. It was like the anime decided on something but then realized that it didn't like it and sloppily backed out of that decision. This all happened within the second half of the show. The first half of the show was perfect.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the first half the characters literally didn't move an inch for about 3-4 episodes and yet those were the most intense episodes of the entire anime and they were the ones that sucked me in the most. With the second half of the anime I skipped through scenes and dialogue a lot because it bored me, but never enough that my enjoyment of the show lessened drastically. It just wasn't very cohesive. The second half had a few good scenes though.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I thought was really interesting about he second half was, was that they introduce this new character who most would consider to be generic main character material. If you were to watch the second half through the eyes of this new character, it would seem like the generic \"main character finds out he is the chosen one and has to save the world\" plot. Except this time the side characters of a story like that were actually the main characters. I don't think I'm spoiling anything here, it was just an interesting take on the situation for me.\\n\\n\r\nI also really liked how the main characters quoted Shakespeare, from Hamlet and The Tempest. I've never read The Tempest, but after watching this anime it makes me want to. On the other hand I have read Hamlet and so when they started quoting Hamlet I'd sometimes find myself smiling as I'd recall that part of the story. It was very unique as I've never seen an anime do something like that before.\\n\\n\r\nOne other thing that bothered me about the second half was the comedy. Unlike the first half, the second half added in some comedy here and there that really bugged me. This anime was not meant for that sort of comedy. This anime was meant to be serious, and it mostly was, but that was why the pathetic attempts at comedy were so jarring and out of place. It was like as an anime it felt like it had to try to add some sort of comedy in there to even things out. Luckily it only showed up here and there and never really with the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nThis was a very good anime. It wasn't really mind-blowing but it was very unique and something I enjoyed sitting through for once. The classical music along with the quoting of Shakespeare was a really nice touch and I really loved the two main characters and their personalities. The story was interesting and unpredictable and there was even some mystery in the plot. I'd recommend anyone to watch this over a bunch of other anime that are considered better than this.",

First of all, I think it had a very nice mixture of everything in it. In the first half of the series, it is like a fast-paced action anime while it slows down to give emphasis to the character development, romance and subtlecomedy in the second half, despite all that it keeps the key mystery element alive in both the halves in its own way....Quotes from Shakespeare's plays are rather used vigorously in the series..well anything goes...each character and their development has also been compared with characters from Shakespeare's plays like Hamlet and The Tempest...but in the end I would say it provides a satisfactory conclusion to the otherwise messy plotline...",

Not much to complain about except that it's setting is a kind of turn-off to most people who aren't generally into magic-related anime.\r\nthe plot was amazing though, and the characters were superbly outstanding with the way they reference both of Shakespeare's works (Hamlet and The Tempest) and even act on the story by using these works as the outline of the plot haha.\r\nThe only thing wrong with the characters is that they tend to get a little mixed up in between who'sthe main focus and who's a background character, otherwise it was perfect.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also very interesting to a degree of philosophy for those that are all over psychological anime with it's mysteries and surprises. \\n\\n\r\nIn general, Zetsuen No Tempest is a very well done work with very few unrecognizable mistakes that make it stand well as a series with good art, sound, characters (and even a very original story) and overally enjoyment.",

            "content": "Blast of Tempest / Zetsuen no Tempest\r\nReview By: John Fragglepuss Evans\r\nBlast of Tempest has good ideas and decent writing, but lost my interest with the incredibly slow story progression and drawn out dialogue. Explanations of explanations and single scenes that lasted longer than an episode were a common occurrence.\r\nYou might enjoy this if: You have patience and like to have everything explained in great detail.\r\nYou might not like it if: You want a story to progress at a decent pace.\r\nNote to the Viewer: Blast of Tempest feels like you are watching a book. It explains everything as if you are just listening to it, notwatching.\\n\\n\r\nEXPANDED REVIEW FROM SLC ANIME:\\n\\n\r\nThere were mixed reviews about the battles, some people saying there was too much conversation followed by too short of a battle. Others thought the importance of the battle was in the conversation, a \u201cLogic Battle\u201d, so to speak. Speaking of conversation, a common comment was regarding how slow the story progressed, a prime example being the scene of the princess trying to get transported off the island\u2026A scene that lasted about five episodes! The series could have been tighter with less explanation. There was super explanation for every possible circumstance, which resulted in poor pacing. On top of that, there were slow pans throughout these extended scenes to make it seem like something was happening, where there was nothing but drawn out explanations. There were mixed reviews regarding the characters. Some people enjoyed the characters while others did not connect with the characters, believing many were pointless or became pointless halfway through the series.\\n\\n\r\nThere was a fresh take on magic in the series, with people having to use talismans to create magic, and the talismans could be used by pretty much anyone with the proper knowledge. The animation was another positive aspect of the series. The last positive comment that was mentioned by several group members was regarding how the series drew on Shakespeare in many ways. For example, throughout the series there are several mentions comparing Hamlet and The Tempest. In other words, if you are familiar with Shakespeare, there are several parts that may interest you.",

            "content": "Maybe this review amongst all the other ones, does not really matter. And i never thought, when i registered to MAL, that i would get through the trouble to write an anime review, but this one was really special... However, let's cut to the chase.\r\nAllow me to express my satisfaction for the ending of this anime. *Hints ahead!*\r\nLately, i was wondering what happened to happy endings. Can't a good... no, amazing series end in a way that won't leave you in despair, like, tragedy? Lately, every idea for a spectular scenario leaves the audience with a sad feeling. Why's that? Can't it have a happyending and still have the desired impact in your soul? Bones fulfilled my wish and it granted me an anime with incredible characters, the right amount of action and a very interesting plot with mindblowing twists. That was, Zetsuen no Tempest. And of course, it ended happily BUT LISTEN... it was *not* a perfect, childish fairytale story. It was mature and complex. No child can appreciate it.\\n\r\nIt revolves around its characters: their bonds, their relationships, their secrets. No one was acting recklessly and there wasn't any obvious feeling of brotherhood, or unity (however you wanna call it). Every opinion about one other person was based on ones actions, not his behaviour like \"Oh friend, come join me at my journey towards greatness. We shall prevail as we're best friends!\". Nobody needed to say this in order for me to understand that. There were conflict and as well as lack of emotions, but despite all that i never doubted Mahiro's and Yoshino's friendship. And i consider that an achievement.\\n\r\nI have no complaint from the animation quality as it elegantly managed to pass every single sign of emotion during every intense scene. I was captured by the mysterious atmosphere throughout each episode, with the only exception being the episode halfway, where the situation completely changed and nothing special happened. I mean, it *was* big but it was also sudden for it to happen so fast.\\n\r\nAs for sound, those violin soundtracks were spot on. They were perfectly fit and suitable for the current pace. Something that happened to me was that the second ending never sounded much interesting at first, but as i was watching through the final episodes it became more and more emotional. A really good feeling that was. And for the rest openings and endings they were not boring either.\\n\r\nIn conclusion, it was a great and satisfying experience. But i wouldn't recommend it to everybody. Some may not find it as interesting as i did, mostly because of different taste. Its kind of fun comes from a different source after all.",

            "content": "Well, this is my first review on MAL so il try to keep it simple and I apologize if my review is not that great and goes off track a bit so i'd appreciate the feedback. This review will try to stay away from as many spoilers as possible so my descriptions may be a little vague. So lets get started, for those of you who are familiar with Shakespeare, this anime alludes to his works Hamlet, a bit of Romeo and Juliet and The Tempest heavily but you dont have to worry about knowing these works to well to follow the story.\r\nStory:\r\nI found thestory to be strong throughout the show, as told in the synopsis this story revolves the protagonists trying to save the world from certain destruction while on their revenge quest. Revenge is the driving factor of this anime, using magic and logic to support these themes. As the show contains many references from  Shakespeare's plays it does not heavily rely on them, the story hints that it could end in a tragedy(based on Hamlet and R&J) or have a happier ending(The Tempest) and so that leaves the viewer wondering how this tale of revenge will end. Most of the show maintains its serious tone, however towards the later half the series it draws attention to the relationships/romance of the characters but this doesn't affect the story negatively. Overall the story kept me wanting more and had me on the edge of my seat.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:\\n\r\nI dont have much to say in this section of my review, overall the art and soundtrack nicely complements the anime, the artwork is nicely detailed, the quality is very nice as well and the mood is appropriately set by the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAll of the main characters are nicely developed and each of them are strong in their own ways and intelligence compliments their attributes as well.\\n\r\nBoth of the female protagonists are strong female leads, Hakaze and Aika are both very confident in their abilities and are accepting of their own fate/destinies, however Hakazes personal emotions can get in her way at times and although Aika has been murdered she still maintains a very important part throughout the series. \\n\r\nIn terms of relation to Shakespeare's plays Hakaze is based on Prospero, the main character from Shakespeare's play The Tempest, who just like her, is a magician betrayed by his servants and left for dead on a desert island, and Aika  based on Sycorax, also from The Tempest, which is a deceased character who appears in flashbacks and defines several of the relationships in the play, and Ophelia from Hamlet whose brother gets crazed by his drive for revenge after her death.\\n\\n\r\nBoth male leads have an interesting chemistry together, Mahiro is based on prince Hamlet and Laertes as well who doesn't care about anything else in order to get his revenge for his murdered sister, when it comes down to fights Mahiro is more experienced and takes the role of protecting Yoshino, he can also be quite reckless and tends not to listen to Hakaze. Yoshino nicely contrasts Mahiro and keeps him in check, he is based on Romeo as he had to keep a secret relationship with Aika and also Horatio as he is the more thoughtful of the two and is Mahiro's closest friend,  he seems like a very nice character but he can very deceitful and manipulative when the need arises.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nZetsuen no Tempest is clearly an enjoyable anime and I do recommend that you do watch this show, it will not be a waste of your time. Although the show is set in a serious tone, there are the occasional comedic breaks throughout the anime that alleviate the seriousness of the show to prevent the audience from being overwhelmed.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully this review helped you in your decision to watch Zetsuen no Tempest, but please read some other reviews as well as this is my first review and the quality of the review is not top notch. I hope to improve my skills and quality as a reviewer and so constructive comments would be most appreciated,\\n\r\nThanks,\\n\r\nKen.\\n",

There is an strong story present in this series. No doubt about that. As you watch, it will put you on the tip of your toes. The characters have an amazing personality that grow on you. Fighting is very much alive in this show but it doesn't shinethrough that. Surprisely, the dialogue, is where this show, that you will appreciate it for. Also, there is an mystery. But I don't want to give away any details. There are two forces at work and both are against each other...that's all I am going to say.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime, made me feel amazed! There were so many awe-sparking moments. Many emotions are delivered throughout this anime. The characters are delivered beautifully. The sound was done splendidly. Art work felt rich with color.\\n\\n\r\nI will give this anime an 10! It's truly an gem that should be remembered!",

            "content": "Before I even start, I'd like to say that this is strictly my opinion. Feel free to disagree. I will try to avoid spoiling the story, but if you are afraid of spoilers you might want to be careful when looking through the reviews.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story in Zetsuen no Tempest had a really great start, lots of twists and turns along the way. From the start you can tell that they are just ordinary teenagers, who find themselves in unfortunate circumstances. After watching the first two episodes, I was hooked. There was good character progression as the show went on, but somewhere along the wayit feels like the characters seemed to lose themselves, and their action became predictable and standard. It changed from something unique into a typical \"gotta save the world\" shounen.\\n\\n\r\nWithout trying to spoil the show for anyone, the ending was a let down. There was so much hype and buildup leading up to the ending, but after watching it I asked myself, \"Wait, that's it? But... What?\". I would compare Zetsuen no Tempest to Soul Eater. I really enjoyed Soul Eater, but it's pretty much universally agreed-upon that the ending was lackluster.\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the art style. It was bright, it was beautiful, and it had a lot of colour. Nothing much more to add, it's nothing revolutionary but it is definitely an aesthetically pleasing show.\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in Zetsuen no Tempest was excellent. Very crisp, good voice acting, and the ambient sounds set up the scene in many cases.\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10 (Slight spoilers. If you don't want to have any kind of spoiler, don't read past the first paragraph of this section.)\\n\\n\r\nI touched on it a bit in the story section, but I loved the characters. They all felt \"real\" in their own way, and you saw a great progression in several of the characters as they are forced to adapt to their circumstances. Yoshino and Mahiro in particular show great changes in their character throughout the show, and I loved seeing it.\\n\\n\r\nI do have a few complaints though. The most prominent being about Hakaze. She is introduced portrayed as the strongest mage of the Kusaribe clan, and she seems like a very strong and independent person who is forced to rely on Mahiro and Yoshino, but later on in the season as Hakaze begins to develop feelings for Yoshino, she stops being that strong-willed person that she is portrayed as in the start of the anime. She becomes completely devoted to Yoshino, and again becomes that shounen stereotype love interest.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this to anyone who is either new to anime, or is looking for something to fill up time. This is by no means a masterpiece, it definitely has it's faults. If I could rate it on everything up until the last few episodes, Zetsuen no Tempest would definitely get a 9/10 for me. However, I cannot bring myself to award anything higher than a 7/10 to an anime with such a disappointing ending. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I definitely had issues with the ending, that did not stop me from enjoying the show and the fantastic buildup to the ending. Again, the ending wasn't the best. It felt too rushed, crammed into a single episode.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are into your shounen, or you want to recommend a show to someone new to anime, Zetsuen no Tempest is a good bet.",

            "content": "\"I loved Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers could not, with all their quantity of love, make up my sum.\" A qoute from Shakespear's Hamlet. A lot of qoutes on Shakespear's Hamlet and The Tempest were mentioned in Zetseun no Tempest .\r\nStory : 10\r\nThe story is really complex. I rarely find a tragic story. So this one really impressed me in a lot of ways. Zetsuen no Tempest contains were composed of two arcs. The first arc is good, but not as good as the second arc, which blew me away in every way possible. If I would describe what the plot is. It'll take me acouple of hours typing it, and its really hard to tell what Zetsuen no Tempest is about without spoiling a thing or two, which, I obviously don't want to do. I'll just tell what to expect on it though. The first arc is focused on revenge, but not entirely, since its about stopping a God doing what it wants. That's all I can say about the first arc, its really hard for me to explain it in detail without spoiling some things. And off we go to the second arc. The second art is A LOT better than the first arc. Unlike the first arc which was focused on revenge, the second plot has tragic things, drama, and a little bit of comedy on it. I won't blame you if you think my review on the story is sh**. Since I myself think that too. Sorry about giving you an half-assed story review. This is the best review I can give you on the story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt : 10\\n\r\nThe art on this series is perfectly drawn in every way. Not much to say on it. It was perfect for me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 10\\n\r\nCharacters on Zetsuen no Tempest was composed by a lot bishounen. It pissed me off at first, I thought that it'll be your average shoujo shows which shows a lot of perfectly drawn cute guys. Aaaaaaand I'm wrong, its true that every guy on Zetsuen no Tempest were lookers. But the girls are hot as hell too. They were perfectly drawn. And they have unique personalities which made them stand out even more. The second arc adds a couple of characters in the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic : 9\\n\r\nFirst OP was made by Nothing's carved in stone. It was cool, I liked them when I first heard them on Psycho-Pass. First ending theme was made by Kana Hanazawa, who made Renai Circulation. As always, she never ceases to impress me with her voice. That calm and collected voice of her. Oh gawd. And the second opening theme is not that bad either! The second ending was cute too.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10\\n\r\nI enjoyed every bit of it. There was never a dull moment for me, even though the series tends to have looooooong debates. Some episodes were focused on conversations, so I doubt you'll enjoy this if you're the \"talk with fists\" type of kind guy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10\\n\r\nWell, what can I say? This thing is a masterpiece(FOR ME!). At first, I thought it'll be another mediocre action-comedy series. I was wrong in a lot of ways. It contains a lot of tragic moments in it. Its not that heavily focused on action, but it certainly had wonderful action scenes. A lot of things were unpredictable. I got hooked immediately after the first episode. Maybe because its been a while since I've watched a serious series like Zetsuen no Tempest. I think half of it was the reason I gave Zetsuen no Tempest a 10. It filled most of the things I find on most of the series I've watched. I must say, this series is worth watching. I'd gladly re-watch the whole thing. I do hope you'll enjoy it like I did.",

It is not something I have to own or re-watch, but it was good. \r\nPros:\r\nGood story\r\nGood main character cast\r\nStrong first season\r\nGood music\r\nGood animation\r\nCons:\r\nWeak second season\r\nToo comedic in some parts\r\nMusic often did not suit the scene\r\nThere is some fan service\r\nWeak side characters. They were not very interesting and simply seemed to drive the plot\r\nOverall: If your able to overlook the cons, its a fairly entertaining series. It is far from perfect, but don't let it stop you from at least one viewing. \r\nTo those reviewers complaining about the use of Shakespeare quotes,throughout the story (and especially at the end), it was very clear why there was so many Shakespeare quotes.  I don't believe the author intended this to be a deep philosophical anime mirroring Shakespeare's works, nor did he attempt to confuse people with Hamlet quotes. \\n\\n\r\nI hope this review helps.\\n\\n\r\nCheers.\\n",

            "content": "Overall - 8.82/10\r\nBeing a two-cour anime series, my expectations were high when I decided to watch this anime based off a recommendation from another friend. I would say that this anime filled my expectations... for the most part.\r\nStory (9/10):\r\nWithout giving too much away from the plot of this series, the first cour of the anime utilized drama and action almost perfectly to the point where every episode left me desiring for more. The second cour, while trying its best to maintain this pattern of well-written drama, took an abrupt turn that I didn't take too kindly to. While I enjoyed it nonetheless with its quirkyhumor and intense action scenes, I couldn't shrug off the feeling that this anime became blander with its transition from the first cour to the second.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\r\nThe character designs were appealing to my tastes, and the overall art of the anime assisted it in cleverly conveying the emotional power of every episode, with different color palettes and lighting conditions portraying the mood of the scenes. The action scenes were also well animated with much attention to detail, made more impressive by the fact that this anime deals with fantasy-like elements (typical of anime studio Bones).\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\r\nI didn't particularly like the openings and endings of the anime, and the sound effects were lacking in some parts, especially during highly intense action scenes. However, I did take a liking to the sound of the voice actors of the anime, especially the performances of Kuwashima (Yoshino), Sawashiro (Hakase), and Kaji (Hanemura). Also, the OST of this anime is amazingly good, comprised mostly of classical pieces that are utilized to the fullest extent in various scenes throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10):\\n\r\nThe character development throughout the series (or perhaps lack thereof) is a key element as to why I have thoroughly enjoyed this anime. Main characters of this story realistically react to their surroundings and the situation based on their established characteristics, and develop as a result. The depth that this show shows into the main characters is one of its highest points, although many side characters are left static and undeveloped, thrown to the side in favor of the main hero/heroines.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10):\\n\r\nOverall, I mostly enjoyed this show from beginning to end, and was hooked by the development of the characters and elaboration of growing, alternating relationships. The drama throughout the story was also great, with flamboyant action scenes and overarching conflicts. However, I find that some are turned off by the sudden twist accompanying the introduction of the second cour, along with recurring tropes and cliches that dampen the enjoyment of the viewer.",

With it's somewhat bittersweet ending and the twists and turns through the story.\r\nMy ratings from worst to best.\r\nSound: 6/10\r\nThe opening/ending is skippable. Nothing special. Maybe it's my taste but for me it didn't gave any plus to the show. Altough it wasn't annoying as well. The voice actors did a satisfying job. I didn't found any mistake in it, yet there wasn't any special in it as well. I think the story doesn't required that so it was not up to the voice actors.\r\nArt:8/10\\n\r\nI liked the art style. The look of the characters were good, this is my preferred way, how anime should look. The one thing I missed was some more detailed movements. After the first episodes, I expected more action so I could've dealt with some more detailed fighting scenes. At the end I forgot about it, because...\\n\\n\r\nStory/Character/Enjoyment: 10/10, a big 10/10\\n\r\nIf there was any mistake in this series it was erased from my memories when we reached the end. This is the story style that most of the modern series are missing. The bittersweet feeling through the whole series. The way they made me feel for both main character. The way how things changed. Finally a story where no one is thrown away because they can't adapt the character to the new situation. Finally a story where you can forget that it's about teenagers, because the deep details of the personalities make you forget about their age. The most satisfying thing for me was that this story felt like it will never end, but always grow, always change. This story felt like life with it's never ending continuity. Until the very last second and even after that this story left you with the feeling of change itself. The bittersweet sentiment of change. Ain't most of the changes in life are like that? Every character was perfectly different in the way how they experience and live through the change of their life.\\n\\n\r\nZetsuen no tempest is the perfect lesson about change in a so enjoyable way that I couldn't resist watching one episode after another.",

The characters really developed throughout the series and the ending is absolutely perfect!",

            "content": "A mage in the barrel, a story of revenge and a happy end. This is the presume of Shakespeare's last work, the Tempest. This is actually what Zetsuen no Tempest is.\r\nStory\r\nOur story starts with Yoshino, a high schooler with a weird character getting dragged in a quest for the revenge of his best friend Mahiro on the killer of his littler sister, Aika. The logic of the world in ZnT is twisted and in the proccess of the revenge quest our heroes they try to save the world from this. All that started because of Hakaze, our female protagonist, the strongest mage who was exiledfrom her clan for her beliefs. The three of them communicate via magic. Througout the story we find oour heroes in difficulties and them trying to overcome them. \\n\r\nThe story is set in two parts. The first part is more action oriented while the second part is more romantic related. It all though adds up to the restoration of the world logic. \\n\r\nThroughout the story we get to hear/see many quotes from Shakespeare's works and mostly from Hamlet is story of revenge with a tragic ending and Tempest, again a story of revenge but with a happy ending. After watching the whole series you'll be able to see these quotes and they true meaning during the story. (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art is superb. The main protagonists are so well drawn that you can't help but love their animation. Don't be fooled, because the boys are beautiful this has no yaoi vibes, it's 100% hetero so worry not about sth like that. The females are drawn amazingly too. Both Aika and Hakaze are made to be beautiful so worry not if you fall for any of the characters. The supporting character are quite well made too. And I'd rather not mention the enviroment or the action scenes they were made very good and woorthy. It's as if there is not even a minor problem when it comes to art. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe OST is very good and has some british aristocracy vibe at times which is to be expected. The first op is a more pump up beat that once you hear it, it can get stuck in your head for a long time, trust me. The first ending is a more relaxing tone in the anime. I believe it's there to ease the stress that you experience during the episode. The second ending is a more calm one. Nothing extremely good but it's not bad either. At best I would say it's average. The second ending follows the same patern w/ the first one. It's a calm one to relieve the stress once again.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nWell the charcter development is quite good to tell the truth. We get to see two clueless guys, each fighting for his own reasons. We see them grow and take responsibillities. Both Mahiro and Yoshino are two character you have to see once. And now the ladies. Hakaze is the one who looks as the arrogant one at first but later on you see how she's changed after certain events and even going to full length as to take full resposibillity for things that have happened. And here we go to one of my fav character ever. Aika. Aika is the deceased little sister of Mahiro. Even after her death she is playing a major role in the story, to the point of totally tunrning the tables when her name is refered. She has a typical school girl character, well not so typical, she has an awful personality, as people state in the anime. I won't spoil the fun though. Watch the anime and you'll sure love her. (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI enjoyed ZnT very much, it's actually one of my fav anime out there. It had plotwists, strong plot and character development. At some point you can even relate to the heroes of the story. So I totally recomend it to anyone interested in a drama with a good story and not stupid high schoolers (even if ZnT has high schoolers it's nothing like school drama). (10/10)\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "THERE IS SPOILERS.\r\nComing into this anime with somewhat heavy expectations I was a little disappointed by what the show had to offer. The show starts outs with an interesting premise, you see these huge stones with chains around them and an eyeball in the middle floating around turning people into iron sculptures. Followed up by easy to follow explanations of what's going on, things progress smoothly until you get more into the battle scenes where you start getting an idea of the type of protagonists you're watching are. Now you're halfway into the show, plot twist after plot twist the show begins to contradict itself,then reset, you're back to point A. With some slow progression you get more plot twists and contradictions. By the end of the show if you aren't lost on what's going on, you've still lost interest in the show. But I can't not give props were props are due, the ending was at least satisfying enough to let me peacefully move onto another anime without scratching my head too much. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem is it's tryhard characters. Junichirou is the powerful but neutral veteran, his confident and carefree attitude makes him come on as trying too hard, he gets even more cringe when he brings his love for big breasts into the equation. Mahiro is portrayed as the badass \"i don't give a f**k\" character who everyone should fear for no obvious reason despite being the most useless of them all in terms of capability to do something. Natsumura and Evangeline are the old couple who try to stay relevant by following the main characters around sometimes throwing the most obvious statements in order to move things along. Tetsuma becomes the uber driver of the series. Aika is the center of everything and also the most pretentious thing in the show, spouting nonstop Shakespeare quotes and in the end when Hakase meets her, she has no will of her own and it seems like she WANTS to die. And Hakase, yeah she's the maiden in love, you gotta have that in there right, at least in contrast to Aika whom everyone seems to put in a pedestal she\u2019s more realistic, acknowledging  the possibility she may be the the one who kills Aika out of jealousy. Samon is the only character I actually thought contributed something, he was comedic and also most of the times the most logical character, from the very begging he seemed to know what he was doing, you were able to see his sincerity and thought process behind every move.\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue was poorly wrtten, I cringed at nearly everything that was said. That includes the pretentious Shakespeare quotes, yeah I hate to agree with the general consensus about it but it's true, there's a lot unnecessary quotes thrown around. I'm not going to quote every single bad script cause that would just be me trying to nitpick, but an example of the worst one was when Hanemura is sparring with Mahiro, gets angry and calls Mahiro a siscon. The three spectators overreact by saying \"The one thing everyone wanted to say.\" or \"The forbidden words.\" Like if Mahiro is even somewhat threatening, he doesn't even use magic or nor does he have any combat experience compared to any of the people spectating. So what reasons do they have to be afraid of him. \\n\\n\r\nI don't have many complaints for the story, I was too adrift in it's questionable characters to care for any plot holes or plot devices. I will say the mystery doesn't disappoint. The story throws plot twist after plot twist repeatedly engrossing you into the mystery, this causes some plot holes along the way, but I was already showing enough disinterest in the show to really bothering paying any mind to it. In the end the show basically ends in the same place it started. Everyone who was alive, lived and the dead stayed dead. There is no more magic, but that doesn't stop the clan from having any influence. Mahiro and Yoshino stay the great buddies they've always been. Everyone lives happily ever after. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is forgettable and that\u2019s just being kind. The only noteworthy feature in it's aesthetics was that it at least tried to add something into it's fashion choices, especially with Mahiro and Yoshino\u2019s clothing details.\\n\\n\r\nOVERVIEW:\\n\r\n I disliked the show. It\u2019s characters were walking cliches, the story loses you in it\u2019s disoriented pacing. There is very little to distinguish it\u2019s artstyle or soundtrack from other anime shows. \\n\\n\r\nIf you wanna try changing my mind or adding on/giving some pointers, I plead that you do.\\n\\n",

To me, frankly, this is not that exciting like people said. Sure the MC are boys. Sure, the girls are strong. Sure, the drawing is great. \r\nBut I just can't get into it. I can't feel the on-edge vibe at all. It just made me wondered, What am I doing? It doesn't have an exciting vibe. It is as if I can predict everything. \r\nOne of the Male Main Character is arrogant, and the other is cautious. They can't bein a pair. Okay, that was just my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, they said that there will be action, and there really is. But they were all the classics 'I will get you! Come get me.' Sort of stuff. Really, I mean, I am tired of those after watching Fairytail. \\n\\n\r\nZetsuen isn't really my type. But I think you should still give it a try since a lot of people said that it was really good. I am not sure how. I guess we do have different opinions. \\n\\n\r\nWell, one good thing about this anime is that it doesn't have Harem/Reverse Harem/ Ecchi and stuff like that.

Needless to say, the first episodes are great teasers because you can expect no less than a masterpiece, the art looks great, the story is innovative, and the overall tone is dark which makes it really entertaining.\r\nBut, if I gave it a 7 is because it doesn't live to our expectations, indeed, the quality and overall enjoyment drastically falls off as the episodes unravel. The shows falls into a magician war, no more, no less, with the only exception of the peculiar situation between the MC and hisfirst love. This is the only reason I gave it a 7 and not a lower grade.\\n\\n\r\nTo be clear, the art is still nice, but the story is such a deception considering what we though were promised. \\n\\n\r\nIf you don't mind all this, you can watch it without any regret because overall the whole thing is entertaining.

The first 12 episodes follow him and his best friend Yoshino as they approach the location of the tree which will end the world.\r\nSome plot twists do exist and I enjoyed those. The flashbacks are also well done with a beautiful sense of nostalgia. But I found the main plot forgettable, eventless, dragged out, and cliche at a few times (-1 point). \r\nOverall, the plot is great and moves not too fast and nottoo slow in pacing.\\n\\n\r\nArt:10\\n\r\nEveryone is either bishonen or bishoujo...\\n\r\nActually that's not the real reason I gave art a 10; yes, the above statement is true but also the landscapes are fantastic. The trees and destruction is extremely well animated and as are the fight scenes. I was practically drooling over the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe opening and ending sequences aren't my favorite (-1). The voices are good and the destruction sounds are good but not fantastic (-1.5).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nOther than the art/animation, the characters are the main dealbreakers in this anime. I loved every character, especially the different sides of yoshino. The relationships between the characters especially yoshino and aika, yoshino and mahiro, and mahiro and aika are amazingly developed and quite cute and moving at times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/overall: 10\\n\r\nThe reason why I'm rating this a 10 even though everything adds to a 9..

I usually left the episodes for last, and only watched them when I really had nothing better to do, maybe a week or two after they aired. I didn't expect anything other than some guys fighting some other guys because they wanted to destroy the world, or something.\r\nOne friend asked me if he should watch this when it was at around episode 4, and I distinctly remember telling him \"It's building up a really weird world, however compared to the rest of the shows I'mwatching now it's pretty mediocre, so I'd probably recommend you watch something else.\"\\n\\n\r\nTHEN stuff started happening. Suddenly, a show I thought would be pretty mediocre all the way started to build up a pretty great world, filled with mystery, suspense and even some comedy, and by the end of the second arc I was at the edge of my seat, and it was one of the few shows these past seasons I couldn't really wait for more.\\n\\n\r\nSince then, there hasn't been a bad episode. They all have been pretty amazing. All the plot twists, all the Shakespeare and so on, this show's universe is quite unique and I loved the show because of it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, I'm really sad it's ended. I rarely have \"Post Anime Depression\", but when I do those are usually the shows I really love. This one qualifies. Were it a theatrical play, I'd still be clapping. It's just that... I grew attached to the characters and the world.\\n\\n\r\nWell, with all that said, there's no way I could give this show anything other than a 10/10 and a heartfelt recommendation to anyone who cares to ask. It sadly doesn't get a spot on my top 5, but it's close. I'd probably have to give it sixth or seventh place in my \"all-time top anime list\" if MAL allowed us to pick more than 5.",

On top of all i read romeo and juliet which can also be felt in this anime as there is the not so forbidden but hidden love of Yoshino and Aika (rome and juliet) which in theend has been found out about. I highly recommend this anime to any one qho likes magic based fights but also to those who by chance have happened to read at least HAmlet or The Tempest and can see the resemblance.",

            "content": "Zetsuen no Tempest has an amazing musical score which accompanies the story and the characters extremely well. The art is really good quality, supporting an interesting, although too action-filled story. \r\nThe first part brings you in a world full of questions, and while action-filled, the mysteries and development between the characters and the protagonists and antagonists make it thriller-like. The Aika flashbacks add an hint of psychological effect which really help not only the narrative and the character development, but also the anime as a whole, making it much more interesting. \r\nThe second part is however disappointing as far as the story goes. Hakaze isadded to the love triangle between Aika, Yoshino and Mahiro and it doesn't seem fitting at all. In fact, it seems forced. While it was well played considering the context, Hakaze nevertheless appears to start \"loving\" Yoshino out of nowhere. For much of Part 1 she was more interested in Mahiro and rightfully so, only thinking of Yoshino as a sidekick, but since Yoshino provoked a change of the end result (indirectly saved Hakaze's life) at the end of Part 1, it was for some reason the catalyst for her love to bloom. The initial love triangle was much more well thought and laid out and would've been good enough by itself. \\n\\n\r\nThe next 10 episodes, 40% of the anime, then focus on destroying the Tree of Genesis and Hakaze going into the past to find out what happened to Aika, in a slower paced environment compared to Part 1. The plot twist of her suicide was Shakespeare-esque, the relationship between the characters too. However, here lies the problem with the story: the first episodes lead the viewers to believe that Mahiro and Yoshino are the important duo, but it really turns out to be Yoshino (most important in Part 1) and Hakaze (most important in Part 2); the story completely shifts to their relationship up to the very last scene. We're also on two general quests, the first and seemingly more important to the \"important duo\" is to find who killed Aika, while the second is to fight the divine trees. These two quests, although eventually ending up being the same, keep pushing the viewers around, wondering which is more important, or maybe that is the point. As such, while in Part 1, the focus was on stopping Samon in order to save Hakaze (and the world, as second motivation) so she could then help out in figuring out who killed Aika. But then, once Part 2 came in, the focus was on destroying the Tree of Genesis, and suddenly everyone was on the same side. It seemed like a rushed turning point and development. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, interesting characters, development, decent story, good art and music. I give it an 8.6, rounded to 9.",

            "content": "Sigh...This show had such potential to wow me.  The first half had me going to whole way, with its play on Shakespeare's Tempest (of which I thoroughly enjoy) and its sense of mystery.  In many ways, I thought it couldn't get any better.  However, after the mid-season break, all of that great stuff that had been leading to something awesome and interesting, and most of all unique, just fell flat when it became a generic save the world plot that never raised the stakes.\r\nCharacters who started off as strong and intriguing became cliches and characters that had little to no charisma cameto the forefront.  The two main guys went from being incredible foils, representing a myriad of Shakespearean characters to becoming basic anime guys.  Overall, the return after the season break just took everything awesome about the first half and just smacked it in the face.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, if you enjoy Shakespeare's work and like the idea of seeing an anime inspired by it, then I would highly recommend watching the first half and stopping.  Obviously the story is not entirely complete if you stop, but most of the themes brought up in the first half are wrapped up by that time.  And everything that comes after has almost nothing to do with the first half.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps it was too ambitious a concept for Japanese teens, I'm not sure, but I believe the show would have been better serviced if it had been written with adult characters instead.",

It has magic and Shakespeare references and great animation and wonderful characters and I just can\u2019t stop gushing about it. I don\u2019t know how closely it follows the manga, but I will definitely be checking it out, but even if it\u2019s completely different, it didn\u2019t seem like two completely different story lines being mashed together (as many anime that deviate from their manga counterparts tend to feel after a certain point). I guess the best way to describe the genre is sci-fi/fantasy with some romance andmystery.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, the ending wasn\u2019t so vague that it leaves you hoping for more while at the same time being somewhat open-ended in the sense that they say \u201cthe end is only the beginning.\u201d I felt it was executed really well.\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening theme, \u201cSpirit Inspiration\u201d by Nothing\u2019s Carved In Stone was really good, and I also loved the second opening, \u201c\u5927\u597d\u304d\u306a\u306e\u306b\u201d (Daisuki na no ni) by Kylee.

            "content": "It's really hard to decide where to start this story. Let's try it like this. You have a brother whose adopted sister has been killed. The boyfriend of the sister is his best friend, but he doesn't know that. Then there is a princess who is the strongest mage in the world but  has been left on a lonely island by her own clan because she would stop them in some evil plan. One day, their paths cross and the story of Zetsuen no Tempest begins. \r\nHakaze Kusaribe, the princess of all sorcerers was stuffed into a barrel and stranded on a lonely islandwhere she can't use magic. Still she somehow manages to get in touch with a guy over a wooden doll that he wears as a necklace. That guy was Fuwa Mahiro. He agreed to help her stop the evil leader of her clan, Samon, but only under one condition. She will use her magic and find the murderer of his sister Fuwa Aika. After being away for about two months Yoshino Takigava, finaly get's to see his best friend again while visiting the grave of his dead girlfriend Aika. He was very surprised to see his friend being able to cast magic but after explaining everything to him Yoshino decides to help Mahiro in achieving his one goal. To revenge his younger sister Aika. \\n\r\nThis is how the whole story starts. An awesome battle between good and evil begins. A story full of magic, action fights, drama, mystery etc. It was epic...In the first eight episodes at least, and maybe in the last four. The part from 9-20 was just crap. It was so disappointing. I mean I expected an awesome story trough out the whole show but in the end I was just happy it was over. Now why? \\n\r\nFirst of all, the thing that made me nearly quit the show was the middle of the show. Now I don't want to spoil anything, but in the part I expected the most action becomes just a dialog that lasted for four episodes if I remember. Yeah, just talk your opponent to death. That was so boring, the magic was gone, the action was gone and so did the entertainment. It was gone. \\n\r\nSecondly, the huge amount of plot holes. I think I mentioned plot holes in a lot of reviews  but it's because I really hate them. Zetsuen no Tempest is after Darker than Black and An Irregular at Magic High School the one with the most plot holes. \\n\r\nNow, the third thing. I really have nothing against plot twists. I like them actually because of that surprise and the sudden change, but. Yeah there is a but. If the twists are bad and they just shatter all the good things of a show, well that makes me rather sad. The whole show looses its sense, the characters become boring, the plot goes nowhere and you just loose your will of continuing watching it. \\n\r\nIt's a pity because the show starts indeed very good. The idea behind the anime is intriguing  and the whole plot and story was nicely imagined. \\n\r\nNow to the things that made me watch Zetsuen no Tempest till the end. THE FLASHBACKS. Although being dead the whole time, Aika gets a huge importance in the show trough all the flashbacks. And believe me, the flashbacks are the ones that kept the show going on. Also one awesome thing, as I mentioned in the intro, the connection with Hamlet and The Tempest. The seek for revenge from Hamlet and the injustice of \"fate controlling\" from The Tempest gave the show that pinch of uniqueness. I really enjoyed trying to find connections to these works and listening to Aika's quotations. \\n\r\nAn awesome plot that looses it self a bit in the middle but finds it self in the end again. \\n\\n\r\nANIMATION AND STYLE \\n\\n\r\nNow, if there is one thing that is worth talking about in this anime than animation. It is awesome. As always Bones production did a great job as most of the anime from 2012. Just watching the action scenes makes you realize how awesomely everything is done. The colors, the effects, the \"spell castin\", everything. I have a bad animation complex. I easily quit watching anime with a bad animation. Hellsing for instance, but let's talk about it some other time. But what makes the animation stand out is still the style. The characters, especially Mahiro and Yoshino, really look kinda different, but definitely in a good way. Great job and a good reason to try to forgive the midpoint catastrophe. \\n\\n\r\n CONCLUSION \\n\\n\r\nIt is really hard to conclude an anime such as Zetsuen no Tempest. The beginning, or let's say the first ten episodes were indeed awesome, and they promised a lot. But after that the only thing left is great disappointment. It does comes back in the last few episodes but that's not it. Just think how many people quit watching. However, you can't say that it is not worth giving it a try. If you like more drama than action than, Zetsuen no Tempest would be anime for you. But of you are more an action fan than watch the first ten episodes, read what will happen in the next ten, and than finish watching the last four episodes. My rating 6,99.",

It might be a very enjoyable story for a college student majoring in English literature. However, it is too complicated for the audience its rated for. PG13 my @$$.. The whole series is a bunch of riddles with a mixture of quotes from Shakespeare's hamlet and the tempest. Be ready towatch the series at least two times for it to just start making sense.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: I do this from my subjective point of view. I am not one of those people who want this double rating system or whatever it's called, I am not trying to be objective in most cases, since I'd rather find here one person with similar tastes than thrashing here something I loved or praising something I hated.\r\nThe settings: It is based in our world with two gods - two giant Trees. What I like about it, is that the makers did do they homework on some of the mythological trees and brought it up at points. Also it then compares the trees to mythologicalsnakes and dragons, there I was kinda sad they didn't mention J\u00f6rmungandr, but maybe not everyone shares my obsession with mythologies. The Magics and rules for using it plus the balance between Genesis and Exodus are well thought through. I personally love when the world where an Anime is set has its own coherent and comprehensive history, which this world has.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: There are two main characters, two less main characters and about a half of dozen not so main characters. The two characters around whom the whole story is revolving are determined to reach their goals no matter the cost. And they don't lose sight of their goals even if it means doing something they don't enjoy. They are just consistent enough to do what is needed to be done. And they are both thinking rationally, there is almost nothing done ilogically. Ever. They are both kinda enigmatic and we learn more about them from flashbacks, which some people don't like but I don't mind it. The two female leads are like opposites of each other. Aika is always composed, coldly calculating and her logic is just too awesome to be true. She likes to quote Shakespeare, which is a bonus point for her. She is the most enigmatic character in the cast by far, but there is still enough of her to connect some dots and make conclusions about her awesomness. On the other hand Hakaze is impulsive, very talented with huge power. She is the only one who kinda loses her goals without achieving them and the only one to act irrationally even though she is the Princess of Genesis and the logic of the world should favour her. Overall all those characters all well written and are given a lot of room to develop. On the other hand the rest of the people are neglected. I can't even write anything besides that, that's how neglected they really are.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: The art is ok, it is pretty standart for new anime like this one which I am really glad because I have sometimes problems dealing with \"ordinary\" anime. I am not an expert in animation, but I know a little something about music. And I loved it here, I think I'm gonna get the score for this one, cause it was really great. If you like something a bit more classical that is, but it usually goes well with the story so it's great.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Enjoyment: What I love about the whole story and pacing is that it actually gives you hints throughout the anime as for what happned or will happen. When you connect the dots you can predict some of the things that will happen but it's just hard enough for it to be fun and not too obvious while still enjoyable. The story tries to address the \"logic of this world\" and what it means for this world to be logical, which is something I personally like. The pacing is good enough, it has a good and becomes better and better till the finale of the first 12 episodes, which was great. The first finale was as great as I hoped for it to be with great dialogues explaing a lot of the world and story and characters' motivations. 13th episode was recap which can't hurt and then the story kinda changed. It became less about fighting and more about emotions. I usually don't like these changes but I guess Zetsuen no Tempest had me hooked by then enogh for me not complain about it too much. Then few episoedes were just OK but then it went back to what I loved and it was even better than before. I would just rename the 24th episode to Epilogue because it was just tying loose ends while the true climax was 22nd & 23rd episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I loved it. I probably always will. I would recommend it to almost anyone.",

            "content": "Kay, I'll admit it. At first I found this anime very original but lack excitation. At some point I found it hard to keep up with or have time after 5 or 6 episode because I prioritized other anime such as Boku wa Tomodachi or Sakurasou that also started during the winter season anime. Therefore I started watching those I put first on the list and got too lazy to watch the rest. \r\nHowever, recently after most of the Fall/Winter anime ended, I kinda ran out of anime to watch. And I happened to catch a glimps of this wonderful anime again so I thoughtto myself \"what the heck.\" \\n\\n\r\nIf anyone of you are familiar to Stein Gate, this anime is also familiar to it. It started slow and painful in the beginning but picked up really fast and furious after 7 or 8 episode. My my, how was I wrong about this anime. Not only this anime played with your mind quite a bit, it also packed with a load of action. The main protagonist which are the 2 boys who resemble the character from The Tempest by William Shakespere was such character I've rarely see in anime these days.\\n\\n\r\nI wont go into details but this anime was such a pleasure to watch after you get through all the introduction. The art was beautiful, music was a pleasure and the character drastically changed during the course of the anime like you've ever seen before. There are some cute/comedic moments with the so called \"Princess\" and the player Yoshino but that was very very cute to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I must say the final fight was somewhat Anticlimactic and in my heart somewhere, I wish it could have been Yoshino and Mahiro who had the power to save the world, I must say that Megumu did a decent job in ending it since he also had a character development despite the small role he had. This ending was probably one of my most favorite during the course of this season anime. You can vividly see the change in character in both which Mahiro and Yoshino after swallowing the fact that Aika had died. \\n\\n\r\nLong story short, the ending was pretty perfect and happy. And this anime is very educational as well teaching all those who isnt familar with the infamous Hamlet and Tempest.",

            "content": "A stylish anime with great art and sound, held back by its mediocre and pretentious execution (review based off current progress, 13/24 episodes)\r\nFirst of all, let's go over the pros:\r\n+ Stylish, well-made OP1 with great visuals that pump up the viewers\r\n+ Decent musical score, especially the OP1\r\n+ Some interesting plot twists\r\n+ Some interesting information that totally changes the direction of the plot\r\n+ Koyama Rikiya's sexy voice (I'm totally gay for his voice acting skills)\r\nHere's a huge list of cons, however:\r\n- NPCs treated beyond expendable (implications of certain events not further explored; sorry if vague, trying not to spoil anything)\r\n- Empty-feeling settings (even factoring in acertain \"syndrome\", settings feel noticeably empty)\\n\r\n- Shakespeare inspiration ends up being random Hamlet quotes that seem pretentious\\n\r\n- ED1, OP2, and ED2 are all crap that seem ill-fitted to the show\\n\r\n- Totally ruin a character by turning her from leader into tsundere (part of the reason why I put the show \"on hold\"; more like pseudo-dropping it)\\n\r\n- Poor transition from first arc to second arc\\n\r\n- Some admittedly horrible character designs (like the blonde dude in OP1)\\n\r\n- Possibly because I haven't watched far enough, but flashbacks involving a certain dead person don't seem relevant and feel like filler\\n\r\n- Plot moves at an intensely erratic pace (super slow plot movement when exploring the past, but insanely quick plot movements in present time)\\n\r\n- Anime has a decent atmosphere in first arc but feels cringy second arc",
