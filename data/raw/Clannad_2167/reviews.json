            "content": "Here's the central problem with Clannad: it wants to tug your heartstrings, so it doesn't think about anything else. Unfortunately for this show, this means that it ends up being utterly contrived, unrealistic, and outright stupid.\r\nThis show expects us to believe that teenage girls act like five-year-olds. It expects us to care about these infantile, one-dimensional characters. It expects us to have genuine emotional reactions to the 'blossoming relationships' between our bland protagonist and these excuses for characters.\r\nIs this too harsh? Let's look at the individual components that MAL expects us to rate anime by.\r\nSTORY: To be fair, the anime didn't have much to workwith, given that it was based on the original VN plot. Still, the outlandish (one word: Fuuko) and emotionally manipulative plot elements (most of the backstories that were explored) weakened what might otherwise have been a sweet, unpretentious slice-of-life drama/romance.\\n\\n\r\nI mean: a story about a girl who is shy and has trouble making friends? Yeah, cool, you can watch Kimi no Todoke or something. A story about a girl with Mysterious Anime Disease who has the intellectual capacity of a child? Sorry, it's not working for me. [4/10]\\n\\n\r\nART: High budget, great production values and art direction. Squishy moe character designs may not be everyone's cup of tea (Sanae looks barely older than Nagisa), but again, that comes with the territory. If anything, this aspect of Clannad makes me despair, because I can think of a lot of better anime series that deserve to have this sort of budget. [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Evocative without being overdramatic, for the most part. Unfortunately, all the female characters sound like babies. [6/10]\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: This is probably the greatest problem I have with Clannad, and again, it's thanks to the source material. Few of the characters get much development. All of them (the female ones, anyway) exhibit some degree of fanboy-pandering. Kyou's tsundere-ness, Fuuko's quirkiness, Nagisa's unending sweetness, etc. - not to mention the fact that Fuuko, Kotomi and Nagisa, at least, sound at least half their age. Their childish and insecure natures (especially early in the series) make for unrealistic characters - and therefore compromise this show's unrelenting attempts at making us care about them.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also hard to understand Tomoya's motivations at the start of the series, i.e. why he even bothered with/cared about Nagisa et al. We get no insight into his motivations at all. Why would a so-called delinquent suddenly take up this project of helping a random girl he's never met before? Why does he find her interesting? What is the point? [3/10]\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Obviously higher if you're a moe fan, but those who derive little enjoyment from watching cute girls doing cute things might find this series rather trying.\\n\\n\r\nThose who watch anime with their brain switched on will find this series trying.\\n\\n\r\nThose who think that female characters should actually resemble, you know, real people... yeah, don't watch this show, it'll make you rage. [5/10]\\n\\n\r\nIf Clannad weren't so obviously manipulative, it might be a better series. Which is not to say that the series is obviously cynical - on the contrary, I think it exhibits a genuine warmth that lesser harem-type series lack. Yet the series ultimately feels contrived and heavy-handed, and its unrealistic characters undermine its would-be heart-warming nature.",

            "content": "\"Poignant. Compelling. Heartbreaking. Clannad is one of the most cherished anime of all times.\"\r\nThe first time I watched Clannad was back in 2008, and I just finished re-watching it for the 3rd time this past few days. Now I realize that will take years before I watch something that does the same impact on me like this anime did. I was moved by it the first time I watched, and the third as well, but surprisingly in a different way. Throughout all anime history this is one of the most notorious series in the romance/drama genre, not only for the emotional load it carries butalso for the effects and different reactions it causes on the people who watched it.\\n\r\nThe quote at the beginning of the review is from the description of the blu-ray edition. Of course they wouldn't bad-mouth their own release on the disc cover, but it's so honest and true that I couldn\u2019t find a better way to introduce this review (I just removed the \"and now it's available in HD!\" part, obviously.) \\n\\n\r\nI'd like to start this review, if I may, going straight to the point; the main reason why some people avoid Clannad.\\n\r\n\"It's too cute.\"\\n\r\nYes man, it is. I agree with you. There were times I thought to myself \"this would never happen in the real world\" but what is the problem? Appreciating these beautiful moments won't bruise you. \"You'll cry\" is also a sentence often read in reviews. I admit, I wrote it on my After Story review, but it's not mandatory! Nobody is obligated to cry or feel sad, it's just that the anime is so strong that it makes a lot of people cry. Even if you're not really into drama or romances, give it a try. If you dislike then drop the 2nd season, but complete this one! It's one in a lifetime experience, I dare to say you'll enjoy at least half of the show.\\n\r\nThe Clannad collection is undoubtedly a well known anime. Even though, the After Story receive much more attention than the first season. Mostly because it's more \"touching\" than its predecessor, but it wouldn't be the same and wouldn't even exist without this prequel. It's the entire set that makes Clannad the masterpiece it is.\\n\r\nSome people end up watching After Story before the first series. The storyline is set in a way it's not necessary watch the first season to understand what is going on, the characters are introduced again and it's a different theme. However, I cannot guarantee that you will enjoy the show as much as someone who watched the 1st season before.\\n\\n\r\nClannad is something I would recommend even to a friend who have never watched any kind of anime. There is no need to have a \"anime background\" in order to enjoy it, it's something everyone, without exceptions, can watch. Despite the genre, age, tastes... There is no gore, violence, profanity, battles... it's just the classical slice-of-life humor mixed with a lovely romance, that proves how strong some stories can be by themselves without any kind of \"attractive\" or fan-service.  \\n\r\nDo you know anyone who's a little depressed and is now reading some kind of self-help book trying to see the \"beauty of life\"? Recommend to him/her this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to define this series with one word, I'd say it's \"charming\". It's an anime to be enjoyed, appreciated. All the aspects of it, including art, soundtrack, characters but specially story.\\n\r\nWhen we were little, we used to find everything amazing, even the most stupid and simple thing was something amusing. We had a hell of a time with friends, laughing for no reason... But, suddenly it's all gone. \\n\r\nAll those great mementos are now just vague memories and you're stuck in a boring and endless routine. This are the thoughts of our male protagonist, Tomoya Okazaki. And this little fragment from the first scene gives you already an idea of how the story will progress. However these are also thoughts we all have inside of us, and that's why Clannad's story becomes so realistic at some point, because it's close to reality, a reality some people have experienced themselves. \\n\r\nDon't worry, this sadness isn't the main focus of the story. Clannad is a heartwarming tale. Our protagonist will make many friends along the way, and with them new situations will appear, turning his lonely days into something much more enjoyable, happy, and also mysterious. \\n\r\nJun Maeda and the screenwriters from Key did a marvelous job with the development of some points from the story, keeping some surprises hidden until the very end.\\n\\n\r\nClannad is a character-driven anime. Since it's based in a Visual Novel by Key, KyoAni decided to maintain the same setting, that's why it is divided into \"arcs\", each one focusing in a specific character.\\n\r\nWhen you say on a review that one series has these arcs, a lot of people usually interprets it with a prejudgment that it's bad because they think it will completely focus in one character during some episodes and leave the rest like if they were in \"standby\". This is not how it works with this series. Clannad was divided into arcs because that's how the Visual Novel was done, it was already like this, KyoAni just decided to follow the order. Even though, these arcs are all tight together and some 'themes' are continuously being developed, sometimes on the background but also taking the main stage at some episodes.\\n\r\nWhile talking about characters, I must praise those who imagined and designed them. From my standpoint, they're original, unique.\\n\r\nNagisa, for example, has a strong personality but is easily turned down, she's caring but also very naive. It must seems incoherent but this is where things gets interesting. These characters' personalities aren't \"fixed\", and just like us, they change as the time passes by. Watching a character that's plain and you can predict its next action is boring. Stereotypes like the \"tsundere friend\" will always be present because in a way or another they're trademarks of slice-of-life. Even though, the way they're interpreted and the actions these characters take is what makes the difference between the average and the outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation has always impressed me with the visuals and the details you can get from their animes. As expected from a high budget company they have in their hands the most recent software. That said, the artwork was also a joy. It's common to see wallpapers of Clannad around the internet, just another proof of it.\\n\r\nThe placement and setting for the story was really well done, all the buildings and alleys seemed like a small countryside city. Same goes for the characters, they all have a clean and careful outline with that \"moe\" style KyoAni has. Like said before, KyoAni did an adaptation of the original story, so it means they had almost everything of the storyline done, this way they could focus on improving and include minor \"spoilers\" and visual jokes from the later chapters into the very first episodes which is great because when you finally get to those episodes, you have that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu kind of feeling and remember they did hint you about that.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack chosen and created for this series is something to give praise. I was astonished with the OST. They included some really emotional piano pieces for the strong scenes but also relaxing songs for the happy moments. \\n\r\nAlthough, they did a huge mistake with the ED. Not that it was the wrong song, Dango Daikazoku is addictive and a cute melody, however, there were lots of emotional endings throughout the anime, but after that heartbreaking scene, they throw the usual ending theme. Ok, Dango is a great melody but it isn't perfect for every moment. You can't have a happy and a sad ending with the same song! In some scenes, it ruined the entire emotional atmosphere  that was built up. This would be one of the few reasons for me to remove some points from Clannad score. \\n\\n\r\nI once read this marvelous anonymous quote:\\n\r\n-\"Oh, now I understand why there are few doujinshi of this anime\" \\n\r\nand a caption followed: \"otaku after watching the complete Clannad series.\"\\n\r\nIt's true! The story is perfect the way it is, nobody wants to mess with it.\\n\r\nIt's a complicated thing to say \"that series is the best anime of all times\", this is something too relative. Even rankings like the one here on MAL aren't trustful. I'm not saying that it's wrong! It's just that these things are extremely relative since each website of anime has it own community and, as well, some differences in the rankings. Even though, there's one thing you can take as \"absolute\". If an anime is acclaimed by the majority of the critic during years it must mean it's good. I hope I was able to make a point, and at least convince some of you to watch it.\\n\\n\r\n[...] adfghkjgfdssSorry, just sweeping my tears of the keyboard.",

            "content": "I have to thank \"Clannad\", for increasing my Japanese vocabulary and introducing me to a new word. While watching \"Clannad\" at my local anime soc, I could feel a certain something radiating from it. I'd encountered similar feelings before from other anime, but never quite so strongly. By the end of it, I picked up a new word to go with that feeling.\r\nThat word is \"moe\". I'd never come across the word before \"Clannad\", and but I sure as hell knew it's meaning afterwards. It describes a feeling that originates from the sweetness of the female characters. But it's not a charming kind of sweetnessthat you get from, say, \"Aria\". It's an extreme kind of sweetness, the kind you get from gorging yourself on the icing from a cake, the kind of sweetness that makes your tooth ache and your stomach churn. I can't stand this kind of sweetness because it's artificial, arising from a cynical, calculated attempt on the makers part to portray the girls as cutely as possible. Taken to this kind of extremes, it has no real substance and serves only as an obstacle to good characterisation.\\n\\n\r\nYou can tell pretty quickly that \"Clannad\" is blatently based on a harem VN or a dating sim. The main protagonist doesn't waste much time hooking up with about 12 different girls. What's more, the character designs, with their various hair colour extracted from almost all major parts of the visible spectrum, are exactly what you'd expect from the source material. There's the Brown Haired Girl, the Blue Haired Girl (they don't even need names, and to be honest they don't deserve names), the Grey Haired Girl etc, and even a pair of Purple Haired Twins. In fact I'm surprised to see the roster is missing a Pink Haired Girl. Of course, a generically distinct personality is assigned to each girl. Now, \"generically distinct\" may sound like an oxymoron, but I assure you it is not. The girls' personalities are all distinct from one another, however they all conform to their own generic archetype that can be readily identified within about 20 seconds of their introduction. There's the Adorably-Childish Girl (aka Green Haired Girl), the Shy Girl (aka one half of the Purple Haired Twins), the Feisty Girl (aka the other half of the Purple Haired Twins) etc etc. Again, I'm surprised to see the roster missing a Ditzy Girl - maybe they deliberately missed one out in order to prevent the whole thing from becoming even more painfully transparent than it already is. It also soon becomes obvious that, though all the girls shows interest in the main character, for the purpose of the \"Clannad\" playthrough, er, I mean, storyline, the main character's \"target\" is Generically Sweet Girl (aka Brown Haired Girl).\\n\\n\r\nThough I guess \"Clannad\" is technically not quite a harem, since there's another guy in the cast besides the main character, it may as well be one, because the other guy in question qualifies as a man only by technicalities. Practically, he's more like some sub-human creature, perhaps on about the same level as a worm, and is suitably treated as one too. Most of the girls treat him with distain and none of them are interested in him in the slightest. To be fair, the main character himself isn't quite your average harem lead, and for this reason, I've given him some more respect than the others characters by actually looking up his name for the purpose of this review (I'm bad with Japanese names and can never remember them): he's called Okazaki Tomoya. For some reason I keep thinking he's called Kyon... I think it's because like Kyon from \"Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu\", he sticks out as the lone, sarcastic voice of relative reason amongst a sea of irrational madness. Anyway, I digress... as I was saying, what make Tomoya different from a typical harem lead is that although he is a bit of a good for nothing person, he's at least more charismatic and confident than that typical loser-but-nice stereotype that's recycled through most harems, and so you can at least kind of see why he's able to get on quite well with his, er, harem.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the insane amount of moe, another thing that stood out about \"Clannad\" (in a bad way) is the insane amount of heavy handed emotional manipulation injected into the show. This show has more of it than \"Saikano\", and THAT is saying something. I bristle at the sight of the slice-of-life tag attached to this title, because this show completely sacrifices any sort of realism associated with that genre in favour of trying to artificially invoke more emotions from the viewer with unbelivable and outrageously melodramatic storylines. The \"tragic\" backstories for the various characters pasts are so contrived that at times it feels like a competition between them  to see which one can be more ridiculous and unrealistic. It's a competition that is eventually won by Blue Haired Girl's (aka Nerd Girl) backstory involving a teddy bear. It's a story that is so \"moving\" that it had everyone in the room bursting into tears. Tears of laughter that is. Moreover, most of the girls - Blue Haired girl being a prime example - simply disappears into the background once their part of the story is over, and the shift in focus from one girl to the next is so swift and ruthless I found it kind of off putting. What's the point of spending an arc fleshing out these characters if they simply get swept under the carpet again once their part of the story is over? Brown Haired Girl is probably the only person who's presence can be felt throughout the series, and that's only because she's obviously the girl who's gonna hook up with Tomoya's eventually (but don't worry, if you don't like this ending, Kyoto Animation has rather helpfully made several \"Clannad\" OVA's that are basically alternative playthroughs where Tomoya picks someone else).\\n\\n\r\nOnly one of the supposedly tragic situations did not come off as overly melodramatic, and that's the one involving Tomoya's family situation with his dad. However, it's side story that's really jarringly integrated into the show. It comes into the show's focus randomly with little apparent purpose. It also feels out of place when placed against the cheesily cheerful parts, and what's more did not really come to any conclusion. It's almost as though when given this piece of material with genuine potential, the makers of \"Clannad\" didn't quite know what to do with it. As a result it feels like a bit of a tag on without much purpose.\\n\\n\r\nI'm really glad that I watched this with my local anime society, because with my stubborness of finishing what I start, watching this whole thing through by myself probably would have killed me. I remember trying to catch up with the episodes on the weeks where I couldn't make it to the society showings, and I literally had to split each episode into two or three chunks to be able to complete it - I just couldn't stomach watching more than a few minutes of it at a time. And no wonder - with its sickeningly strong stench of moe, ludicrously contrived stories and array of cardboard template cut-outs masquerading as female characters, just what is there to like for someone who's not into moe or extremely sappy melodrama?",

            "content": "Clannad was an anime that didn't know what it wanted to be. It tried being a drama, romance, slice-of-life, and comedy all at the same time and just ended up becoming dumbed down.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nAs a romance, it was piss-poor with a mostly one dimensional cast of female characters with the exception of two that actually had personalities. For me, it failed as a drama. The first big arc is focused around a character that was extremely annoying. It made me not care at all about what happened and I had zero emotional connection to anything since that part. Clannad is primarily supposed to be aromance/drama but it best aspect is its average comedy/slice-of-life aspects. That is not a good thing. It had it's moments, but all those moments were comedic.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nThe fucking eyes were so bad. Okazaki's eyes looked fine, but why only him?\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nIt was okay.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nThe main love interest, Nagisa was one of the worst characters I've ever seen in anime. She's more one dimensional that a line. Throughout the whole anime Nagisa acts like a five year old child, never has any character development or changes. She is the biggest cause of Clannad's ruin. The only characters that make this anime watchable are the male characters Okazaki (main character) and Sunohara.The two female characters that have personality end up completely unimportant. Overall, over half the cast is useless.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nI had to force myself through this. I'm not sure why Clannad is so praised. Yes, I've watched After Story. However this is isn't a review of After Story, it's a review of the first season (Not that After Story is much better). This season of Clannad fell flat is so many ways. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10",

            "content": "Clannad. Made as a visual novel by Key, made into an anime by Kyoto Animation. This combination has been seen twice before, in the series Air and Kanon. Both are well-known among anime fans, and mostly positively received. And anyone who has watched either or both of the two previously mentioned will definitely have their expetations of what Clannad will offer. These expectiations will probably, in a way, be fulfilled; yet Clannad is certain to sweep you along and astound it with its gripping tale. \r\nThe story itself is set to a small Japanese town, and a select few inhabitants of that town. The firstperson to note is Okazaki Tomoya, a high school senior notorious at school for being a tardy delinquent; always late for classes, if he shows up at all, and he surely doesn't care for anything. And while that is true, he isn't the kind of person who goes looking for fights and has a foul mouth. The reason for his current life situation is a complex one, but can be summarized as such: He's simply bored. Of going to school. Classes. The town he lives in. His home and drunkard father.\\n\\n\r\nThat however, changes drastically one day, when walking to school. he hears a girl mutter the word 'anpan' to herself. This draws on his curiosity, and before long, the two of them are talking to each other. The girl, Nagisa Furukawa, evidently mutters names of foods she likes, to give her the confidence to get through the day. She is currently repeating her senior year due to illness, and she has one thing she absolutely must do: Re-establish the school's drama club.\\n\\n\r\nTo do this she needs members. And before long herself and Tomoya are looking around the school for new members. And here the somewhat-standard harem cast is built up. The soon-to-be drama club members are for the most part girls, each with their distinct personality and quirks which probably aren't unknown to someone slightly experienced with this kind of anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe route it takes from here is, at its bones and skeleton, a standard visual novel approach. There are several story arcs covering various amounts of episodes; each arc focusing on a specific girl. Of course, this means that the girls have their problems and issues which they have to deal with. And our main characters do just that, by valiant effort to help their newfound friends. And a little bit of Dr. Phil mixed in. One of my pet peeves with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut from what we now know, it sounds like any other anime of this type. So what is it that sets Clannad apart from the rest, and elevates it above them? \\n\\n\r\nThe first answer would be the characters. Yes, they start out a bit clich\u00e9, in some ways, but that's not really a bad thing. Making totally original characters personality-wise nowadays isn't that easy after all. What Clannad does with the characters after their introduction, however, is amazing. Not only are their struggles portrayed excellently and grippingly, they develop into strong induvidials who are there for their friends, who can face the world and its hardships more openly.\\n\\n\r\nThe second answer lies in its themes. Here it completely blows everything else out of the water, because what the producers want to tell us through Clannad is realistic and believable what concerns both actual plot execution and message. What the characters do, I can belive. What they learn from their struggles, I can learn and take with me to real life. That's how strong Clannad's message is.\\n\\n\r\nMostly it's about family. What is a family? Who can be family? How important are bonds? What if you don't have proper family at home; only jerks with no right to call themselves your family? Clannad tells us that a family can be found anywhere; not only in our own home. The main characters of the show may just find their own little family together, as they work with the drama club. \\n\\n\r\nA character which I think deserves extra mention is Sunohara. He is in many ways the comedic relief person; when you see him around you expect something funny to happen. Or well, at least that's what you're supposed to do. But Sunohara isn't just a blond, shallow klutz. At times he really shines through with his deep character, proving that he, too, can be a capable supporter among his friends.\\n\\n\r\nAs most would expect of Kyoto Animation, the animation budget is all but slim. One of the things which makes Clannad so lifelike is the animation itself, through sheer quality. Lucid, vivid and soft colours makes sure the eye is pleased through gentle contrasts and lifelike static and non-static objects on-screen, be that walls, characters, cityscapes or other such things. The detail level is exceptionally high, which again contributes to that feeling of the series being alive. Clothing, furniture, decorations, it's all there and looking truly neat. But what contributes most to this feeling of being alive lies in the character motions. Not only are they fluid and pleasant to watch, they're abundant. You've most likely watched a series only to find that the characters walk stiffly, and when they talk they remain static during the whole conversation, save for maybe one or two motions. In Clannad, they swing their arms to be dramatic and to prove their points. They aren't static when jsut standing upright speaking. They do things during conversations which ensures that they seem more like real humans standing there than 2d anime characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what would a show be without its music? Just as the animation contributes to the series coming alive, the music does an outstanding job at amplifying the emotions portrayed. Many of the themes are dramatic, sad; this to reflect the overall sadness of Clannad. Yet there are other themes too which fit right in. The standard new day at school theme, some comedy-like themes, they are all there. And they are composed beautifully, making sure every mood swing and feeling sweeps your heart away, gripping at your innermost feelings of empathy and compasion for the characters. The opening theme, remixed from the game's counterpart, is a lovely upbeat theme mixing strings, a neat bass and percussion all mixed into an allegro which has interesting lyrics as the topping. The end theme is basically a metaphor for what goes on; the dango family representing Nagisa and the caring people around her. It is a very bittersweet tune, offering cuteness and melancholy all the same.\\n\\n\r\nAnd parallelling all that happens is the story of a girl in a world that has ended. A strange, mysterious world, where she is alone. All alone, savefor a doll she built from scrap metal. What this symbolizes and means, you can watch for yourself. Though, this side-story's relevance to the main plot is not revealed properly before the second season.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Clannad offered a very pleasant surprise to me; offering both enticing themes, a fresh plot and interesting, deep characters. Once during the season I also had to experience a tear making its way down my cheek. That's the kind of anime this is. If you haven't watched it, you should definitely give it a try.",

            "content": "\"Key's 1st non-adult visual novel proved to be a success.\"\r\nUnlike its two predecessors (Air and Kanon) that started out as H-Visual Novels, Clannad was released for all-ages and does not contain any fan service (although the selling point is still harem). Being Key's second longest work, Clannad is not a simple story that can be summarized in a mere 23 episodes TV series. As a result, Kyoto Animation released an additional 24 episodes in the sequel Clannad ~After Story~. As the third anime adaptations of Key visual novels, Clannad certainly is a must watch for all Air and Kanon fans.\r\nThe Clannad visual novel was splitinto two segments, \"School Life\" and \"After Story\". Clannad features the \"School Life\" segment, while the \"After Story\" segment is in Clannad ~After Story~. Each segment is further subdivided into arcs about each heroine. Similar to Kanon, each heroines' arc describe something unique relating the heroine to the main male protagonist. The transition from arc to arc are often very smooth and does not leave the viewers with any confusion.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality is slightly better than previous Key adapations by Kyoto Animation. For those who are not familiar with the producer, Kyoto Animation (products include  \t\\n\r\nKanon (2006), Air, Full Metal Panic series, Lucky Star, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Kiddy Grade, etc.) has a pretty good reputation for its high level animation. Simply put, one will be find nothing but beautifully drawn girls, dynamic backgrounds, and completely fluid movements in this touching anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP, Megumeru ~cuckool mix 2007~, is sang by Riya of the Eufonius band. To those who have played the visual novel, it should be familiar as the song is actually a remix of the original game OP. While the ED, Dango Daikazoku, is sung by Chata. \\n\\n\r\nAs with many major titles, Clannad also come with a great deal of seiyu talents. Some of these big names include: Mai Nakahara as CV of Nagisa Furukawa, the main female heroine. Mai is famous for her role as Mai, the female lead in Mai HiME, and Norah in Spice and Wolf. Mamiko Noto as CV for Kotomi Ichinose. Mamiko is famous for voicing as Hecate in Shakugan no Shana, Kouta in Kanokon, and Yuka in Elfen Lied. Houko Kuwashima as CV for Tomoyo Sakagami. Some of the more well known roles by Houko includes Clare in Claymore, Flay, Natarle, and Stella in Mobile Suit Gundam Seed / Destiny (yes THREE major roles, yet one can hardly tell they are voiced by the same person), and Quon in RahXephon. Yuichi Nakamura as CV for Tomoya Okazaki, the main male lead of the anime. His past roles include Alto in Macross Frontier, and Graham in Gundam 00.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are highly likable with a large variety of \"flavours\" to choose from. There is the tsundere type, strong-willed type, gentle type, bookworm type ... basically you name it, they have it! Since only 2 of the girls' arc are really covered in detail in Clannad, one might get the feeling that certain girls seem more \"developed\" than others. It should also be noted that there are quite a few unresolved character relations at the end which might make certain viewers feel unsatisfied with the ending. But please keep in mind that this is only half the story, thus one should expect plenty more character developments in the latter half along with more complete, resolved relations.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, Clannad was more enjoyable than Kanon (2006) largely due to the more obvious humours (ones where you will laugh when you see/hear it, rather than those that require thinking and laugh in the aftermath). Tomoya's encounter with the girls are also MUCH more natural (and believable) than Yuuichi's ... in Yuuichi's case, it is almost always \"oo.. must be a girl he left behind in his childhood\" and yet most girls remember him and he only forgets them all.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, that is not to say there is nothing to complain about regarding Clannad. What really nags me is the occasional intrusion by Fuko into the scenes in later episodes. It really disturbs me and I find it absolutely unnecessary. Was it like that in the game too?\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I want to point out that there is an episode 24 (DVD only) named Clannad: Another World, Tomoyo Chapter where the focus is on Tomoya and Tomoyo (what a nice pair of names). Evidently as the name implies, it takes place in \"another world\" thus it does not directly relate to the TV series of Clannad nor Clannad ~After Story~. But Tomoya x Tomoyo supporters would not want to miss this rare opportunity to see them embracing each other!",

            "content": "CLANNAD is the most fabulous harem anime I have ever seen, mostly because it doesn't play out entirely like a harem anime. \r\nThe story is totally unique. An outcast, troubled boy tries to help a sickly, shy girl in forming a drama club. Why does he help her? Why does she want to do it? All sorts of great questions are asked, and the beauty of it is that some are not answered. Things just happen in life, don't they? Sometimes there's never an explanation. The story follows day-t-day school activity and home life. If you're into slice of life with romantic appeal, then you'dlike the story for CLANNAD. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was colourful and pretty, though it may be too moe for some people. There was some good use of bright colours, and it doesn't ever look dull or tired. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was AMAZING. It created a wonderful mood and the ED makes me want to get teary. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters were all unique and awesome. They were bittersweet and touching, each and every one of them. And I must say, Nagisa and Tomoya make some excellent leads, and Sunohara wins hands-down as best supporting character ever.\\n\\n\r\nI loved CLANNAD. It was beautiful. There were one or two unfabulous things, like when it got traditionally harem-like (boobs pressing against guy's back, a ton of girls who want him, misconstrued sexual situations) but the brilliance of it otherwise overshadowed that. \\n\\n\r\nIt is moving, emotional, and lovely.",

            "content": "Clannad, Kyoto Animation's latest anime release, exhibits the meticulous and revered production quality of all the studio's previous releases.  Based on a visual novel by Key, Clannad takes the viewer into a seemingly simple story of life at school, but the series soon develops mysteries and tales of wonder.\r\nEach girl in Clannad (main and supporting cast) has her own personality quirk, one of which is bound to attract a fan.  That kind of variety works to attract many viewers.  But Clannad is not necessarily a \"harem\" by its general definition.  While Tomoya's daily life is indeed surrounded by beautiful girls, heis not interested in dating any of them.  Instead, he becomes involved (accidentally or not) in their hopes and concerns, and the storytelling of the series becomes apparent through the dramatic character development.\\n\\n\r\nIn most episodes, the flow of the story involves each girl a little bit at a time, which I prefer since the drama feels more realistic.  Character development occurs in parallel, and more drama can be drawn from the intertwining relationships among the characters.  Some episodes do define their focus on a particular girl, but the overall immersive feel of the series is not lost.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that Kyoto Animation produces this series has been a recent guarantee that the artwork is superb.  Characters and backgrounds are brilliantly drawn.  Motion of all kinds are captured smoothly -- not only characters walking but also the wind blowing on their clothes.  Body language is also visible, which speaks louder than words most times.\\n\\n\r\nAll the music is taken from the original game, which many fans praise, although it does not allow for too much creativity.  Regardless, the original music is full of variety and is easy on the ears.  Plus it was composed to fit the story for a reason; why not reuse it?  The ED thing (at least the lyrics) is new, though, I believe.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the storytelling is excellent, most of the enjoyment lies in the humor, which is mostly cute and/or slapstick stuff.  Only in rare occasions does the humor detract from the story and drama, but it is mostly timed well and presented as a fun change of pace after a very emotional sequence (or before the next one).  Speaking of emotional sequences, I found myself crying on more than one occasion.  Clannad pulls at the heartstrings very effectively when the time is right.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the defining points of Clannad are the supernatural elements (gotta break the laws of physics a tiny bit to tell a unique story), the moe factor (cute girls are cute, but not totally unrealistic), and the emotionally gripping story (everyone is connected to the overall theme of the series -- family).\\n\\n\r\nI regret that the series is about to end, but I have loved it every step of the way.  Kyoto Animation has such amazing respect right now that I'll give all of its future Key adaptations a 10/10, before having seen any of the episodes or knowing anything about the series.  They know how not to disappoint.\\n\\n\r\n(Originally written 11/22/07 after episode 7.  Last updated 02/09/08 after episode 17.)",

            "content": "Clannad is the 3rd in the line of Harem, Romance anime based of Key&rsquo;s Visual Novel (dating sim) and with the bar set pretty high, this anime is able to reach the expectations of its fans.\r\nVideo Alternative\r\nThe series begins as a usual high school anime, with no defined plot or storyline but just introduces the male protagonist and the girls that the series revolves around. From the first couple of episodes it is easy to pin point the obvious similarities it has with its predecessor (Kanon) but the major difference is the level of comedy. The comedy of Clannad is on a completely different level,as it manages to turn anything to do with games (RPGs) or romance anime into a hilarious joke. However during the girl's various stories the comedy is somewhat replaced with some heartfelt drama, which adds depth to the series but it lacks a bit of substance. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter much though, as this once again proves to be a winning combination.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are an important aspect of this &ldquo;winning combination&rdquo;, as you will grow to care about some of the characters so much that you may even shed a tear. The girls are the major part of the story and even though their personalities are a little clich&eacute;d, they each get their own moment to shine. However the length of the series did negatively affect the girls during the 2nd half of the series. The male protagonist (Tomoya) is surprisingly well developed, as he intermingles between the girls various stories and of course, brings most of the comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the animation is nothing short of wonderful, with beautifully drawn girls, dynamic backgrounds completely fluid movements that would put many shows to shame. I&rsquo;ve probably said this same thing to a lot of other anime series but if you know anything about &ldquo;Kyoto Animation&rdquo; then you&rsquo;ll know the sort of standard you are going to get, from watching this masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the music in a lot of other KyoAni shows, the music plays an important role in Clannad and I&rsquo;m not only talking about the catchy OP and ED theme (dango). Each of the main characters gets their own theme tunes that go well with their personalities, adding a sort of personal touch to the main girls. Nonetheless it does get a bit repetitive, listening to the same tunes over and over.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Clannad has proven to be one of the best Harem, Romance anime of our time. It is really hard to find a flaw in this amazing series, because it has superb visuals, a great story and some of the best characters. Even with a lot of parallels with its predecessors, Clannad still manages to break free and become a show of its own. Of course it is riddled with clich&eacute;s and cheesy moments but you wouldn&rsquo;t mind, due to the many hilarious and touching moments.\\n\\n\r\nYou don&rsquo;t need to be a harem anime fan to enjoy Clannad, you just need a heart.\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "I was randomly looking around for a new anime too watch, but at the time I were watching alot of action animes and never considered to watch any romance/drama animes. I joined a chat on an anime site and asked for a recommendation. Someone mentioned Clannad and alot of people supported the suggestion. In any case: I started too watch Clannad.\r\nArt\r\nThe first thing I noticed about Clannad was the art, it is probably one of the best elements in Clannad. I would often pause the anime for a minute just to watch the surroundings. I concluded that the sunsets were the most beautiful. Why? Becausethe orange glow it emitted was just stunning. Never before had I seen anything similar in an anime. Well, we do got other animes from Kyoto Animation, like Air or Haruhi Suzumyia. But I still found Clannad's art more charming than any other anime. The character art is also brilliant, and can resemble Haruhi Suzumiya, Kanon and even Lucky Star. A huge element which Kyoto Animation used was tears, you could for example often see Sunohara cry out of pleasure, pain or by being fooled by Okazaki. I can't find anything bad about the art in Clannad and therefore:\\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                 Rating: 10\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nAnother good thing about Clannad is the sound. From excellent voice actors like Yuichi Nakamura, Mai Nakahara, Ry\u014d Hirohashi and Daisuke Sakaguchi too amazing situational music. Clannad soundtrack covers everything in a perfect manner: from spirited and happy moments too melancholy and sad moments. Jun Maeda, Magome Togoshi, and Shinji Orito who are the geniuses behind the music also made soundtracks for Air.\\n\r\nThere are also soundtracks which fits each character. For example you have Sunohara which have uplifting and spirited music which fits too his personality. Nor in the sound can i find any flaws, and therefore:\\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                 Rating: 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nOne thing i simply loved about Clannad were the characters. How they were presented, their development and everything else about them. Each character had their past and views about things throughly explained throughout the anime, which was a first for me. And while watching Clannad, i felt like i were bonding with each character. Which made After Story a heart breaker, but lets save that for later. \\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                 Rating: 10\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nClannad's story is separated into several arcs. You have the very beginning of the anime were the main characters and some secondary characters are presented and also some relationships start to spin off. Then you have the  Fuko Ibuki arc, the Kotomi Ichinose arc and after that Clannad keeps building the relationship between the characters. You often get a harem feel in Clannad, although it is not presented on a \"ecchi\" basis which we often witness in comedy/romance animes. Well, you have Sunohara of course, but the protagonist, Okazaki, isn't really the ecchi type. Of course, there are a few moments, but it is not the main basis of Clannad's humor. Which I think affected the story in an excellent way.\\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                 Rating: 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nClannad's humor is just flawless. It's not too ecchi and you never seem to get tired of Sunoharas stupidity or Okazakis pranks. You also have Kyou's anger and Tomoyo's grown up personality and her desire to be a student council president. These are of course just examples. But there are also sad parts in Clannad which I think were done really well. And it were all supported by excellent music.\\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                  Rating: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say? I loved everything about Clannad, and it is by far my favorite anime. I can recommend this anime to everyone, it is really worth taking a look at. Even if you don't like romance/drama/humor as much!\\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                  Rating: 10",

            "content": "Please, why is it noone sees that this anime is a disgrace to anime? Look at it, look at it! Of course, I realize that saying that is wrong since, in truth, there are worse animes than Clannad, infact there are quite a few that are worse, but they are accordingly and consequently rated much lower than Clannad. \r\nOk, let's disregard everything and just take a look at the characters? I mean what are they? They have no personality whatsoever, they borderline characters that are in really, really bad harem animes and there are some really bad ones out there. Basically the only good haremI've ever watched that outright called itself a harem is Kimi ga Nozomu Eien.\\n\\n\r\nBut this is not about Kimi ga Nozomu Eien, it's about Clannad. An anime which has produced a sequel. Both the first one and its sequel have recieved much praise from many people. I don't see it at all and I must go back to my main points of criticism which are characters, character development and character interaction. Basically everything that had to do with characters in this anime downright sucked. The story isn't good either but atleast it had a few redeeming points, the characters did not. And what's more; there was no comic relief character, there was no funny guy, the funny guy was a complete drag and a pushover.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to stop, you thought I was going to stop didn't you? I'm not going to stop. It is just too fake. Anime is perhaps not always supposed to depict real life events, occurances and scenarios, but come on, the interaction between the characters was just too fake. It felt like they weren't even in the same scene as eachother. Now I'm going to talk a little about the main character; he has no personality. I said that earlier didn't I? Well I can afford saying it again. Why is he even bothering showing up on screen? What is he saying? Does anyone care what he's saying? You know who's worse? Nagisa, the female main lead. She's like a dog, or a cat, or any other fluffy cute animal. The only difference is that Nagisa can speak, but just like cats and dogs she doesn't really have to speak because whenever she does say something it's completely meaningless and without any worth.\\n\\n\r\nOn the bright side, it had some decent art and animations, which is something that can only be expected from KyoAni. Yea that's about the only good thing I have to say about this anime, well apart from the fact that it's ranked much higher than many animes that are much better than this, an abomination in itself. But it's still a redeeming point that the anime possess I suppose.",

            "content": "Clannad revolves around a high schooler, Tomoya, who after befriending a young girl named Nagisa, makes new friends. Tomoya quickly discovers that there's more to these young girls than meets the eye and tries to help them with their problems while dealing with his own.\r\nStory: What more is there to say about the story other than it's great? The word clannad means family. There are five girls, each with their own story to tell that somehow involves family. Although there are many comparsions to Kanon, they remain different because Kanon's overall story was about miracles, while Clannad is about the bond of family.\r\nArt: As expectedof Kyoto Animation, the animation quality is superb. I don't think there's a single negative comment I can make about it. The character designs are great. The way the characters look and act line up perfectly with each other. The background isn't lacking of detail either.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening and ending songs fit well with the story. The opening shows the dramatic side and the ending shows the light-hearted side. Nagisa's voice is portayed very well. Her insecurities an naviety are very evident. Tomoya's funny antics shine brightly through his voice. The music played during comedic scenes and the music played for emotional scenes fit perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Each character is very unique and different from each other. There's the strong-willed loud mouths and the insecure shy types and not to mention the two delinquents that provide the much needed comedic relief. They all have separate yet equally srong stories to tell.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I definitely enjoyed this series. It has every aspect an interesting story needs: drama, comedy, and romance. The comedy scenes sit well with the series because they keep the story from being too emotional. The romance is also nice. Nagisa and Tomoya have such a cute relationship. It's interesting to watch their two different characters interact.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think this is a series that should not be missed. Regardless of what intrigues you, you're sure to find something you enjoy about this series.",

            "content": "I rarely go for so-called \"slice of life\" stories, but I heard a lot about this anime. I heard it was amazing. Maybe I'm just a weirdo, but by the end of it, my thoughts were quite the opposite. \r\nI'll describe the given categories in order of importance, from least to greatest.\r\nLets start with the -sound- \r\nI enjoyed the opening theme, \"Megumeru\", and ended up adding it to my playlist. The music overall is good. That's all I have to say about that.\r\n-8/10-\r\nNow for the -art-...\r\nUnfortunately, I found it very annoying. When Tomoyo first met Nagisa on the street and she opened up those horrificallyhuge eyes, I literally facedesked. What the hell is this? This pseudo-chibi, or moe style or whatever it is... it's not cute. It's not \"kawaiidesu.\" It's extremely... I don't know how exactly to describe it. Let's just say that at first, the sight of them made me want to break things. By the end, I was desensitized, of course... but the point is: They look like extraterrestrials.\\n\r\n-5/10- \\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for the -characters-... \\n\r\nThis is the main reason I was turned off by this anime. I hated most of them, and I was quite disgruntled by their behavior. I will describe the mains in order from the ones I dislike the least to the most:\\n\\n\r\n-Tomoyo- \\n\r\nThis is the one girl from this silly harem that I actually like. She is ambitious, and she knows exactly what she wants, unlike many women. Not only does she know how to fight, in every sense of the word, but she knows how to cook for and take care of her man - the complete package in a woman. -8/10-\\n\r\nI also like her little brother. \"Hey mom, dad, I want to see the sakuras together every year!\" \"Oh honey I dont' know...\" *takes out razor blade* \"Oh there's some peach fuzz on my wrists. I'll shave it off a little\" \"OH WAIT DON'T DO THAT HONEY! OKAY WE'LL DO IT!\" I was certainly intrigued by his persuasion techniques.\\n\\n\r\n-Youhei-\\n\r\nYouhei seems to be a comic relief character. I don't like those. But then again, he always seems to get thrashed verbally and physically by everyone. So I suppose I feel some sympathy for him. There was nothing special about him, but I couldn't find anything serious to dislike about him either - a fairly decent character overall. -6/10-\\n\\n\r\n-Kyou-\\n\r\nI don't like her simply because she's a jerk. She really doesn't do that much in the story other than being a loud obnoxious little jerk. And it's annoying. I don't have much else to say about her. -5/10-\\n\\n\r\n-Kotomi-\\n\r\nApparently she's a genius. But when we first met her, I got the impression that she was a retard. She does pitiful things like crying in a corner while her friends break their backs for her. I cannot appreciate that. -5/10-\\n\\n\r\n-Fuuko-\\n\r\nAnother ridiculous sob story. Probably the most ridiculous of all of them. Her obsession with wooden shuriken did not amuse me, nor did her cameo appearances. - 4/10-\\n\\n\r\n-Tomoya-\\n\r\nAh... the main character... His right arm can't shoot basketballs anymore, so instead of learning to use his left arm like any rational person, he becomes a \"delinquent.\" And so he discovers poor little Nagisa-chan and randomly decides to dedicate his life to helping her realize her dream, because his own life no longer has any meaning. He also wants to help every stray girl he comes across, instead of focusing on his studies. I'm sorry but I can't admire or respect a person like that, because if you don't have any ambition and can only worry about others, what's going to happen to you? It's not like you're gonna get a huge prize at the end. You will still have to hope for the charity of others yourself... for the rest of your life. I cannot support such a lifestyle. And the part that irritates me the most is the situation with his father. The guy is apparently a bum and needs help. If Tomoya should be helping anyone, he should be helping him. The name of of this story, \"Clannad,\" implies that this is supposed to be about \"family\" right?  Well, there is no real reason Tomoya can't forgive his father for the greater good, for the sake of family. Yet somehow Tomoya would struggle to help random girls off the street over his own father. Regardless of what happened between them, I cannot respect that. All of this is only half the reason I hate this guy, but I can't say the rest without writing spoilers. So there you have it. -3/10-\\n\\n\r\n-Nagisa-\\n\r\nAnd now the character I hate the most - the type of female I hate the most. She is the kind who is completely helpless on her own. She can't do anything for herself, and if Tomoya hadn't taken her in like a stray animal she would have sat alone in a corner eating bread for the rest of her life. She is the type of girl who has no self-esteem and at one point is even sorry for being born. She has great trouble calling Tomoya by his first name even after all they've been through, due to her obscene lack of self-confidence. By the way, when I go to Japan one day, I'm just gonna call all of them by their first name with no honorifics, just for teh lulz. Anyway, she relies solely on the help and sacrifice of others, and she wants to waste it by sulking and crying in a corner. Quite frankly, it's pathetic.  I don't accept that she's \"physically weak\" as an excuse. I've seen autistic paraplegics with more independence and fiber of character.  -2/10-\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for the -story-\\n\r\nAll in all, it's all about Tomoya's life's mission to help stray girls, and how they all want him. I'll admit I was amused in some parts, and maybe a little sympathetic in others, but not enough to make up for everything else that bothered me. That's all I have to say about that. \\n\r\n-4/10- \\n\\n\r\nAnd my -enjoyment-\\n\r\nI will simply repeat the word \"decent.\" To be quite honest, the only reason I kept watching this show after the atrocious Fuuko arc was the same reason some people would vote for say... Sarah Palin: \"morbid curiosity.\"\\n\r\n-4/10-\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I don't know if my curiosity is enough for me to continue with the \"After Story\" ...maybe if I'm extremely bored one day. Well, whatever. Thanks for reading.",

            "content": "From what I've heard from many of my friends and reviews, generally Clannad is a heartwarming tearjerker with the very adorable characters. But based on viewing it, I say that people who do not prefer \"moe\" like me will have a different opinion.\r\nWhat is \"moe?\"It is a terminology that takes on many forms in anime;  I have no right to define it but for me the closest meaning to it is \"cuteness\"\r\nStory (7/10)\r\nClannad's story is a slice of school life where the main characters encounter different people and situations alike. Each has their own conflict as a student, as a family member or asan individual. In my opinion, the story is simple.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I find its arcs or stories not surprisingly new. Problems about self confidence, crushes and parental relationships are already common though the way the protagonists address those problems are certainly interesting to see. Some things will make you smile,some has surprising twists and some may break your heart.  But in another prospective, Clannad may be truly intended to those that relate to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is slow; it does not jump right into the situation but rather introduces its featured characters and shows their personalities and comical sides; though some may find those tidbits insignificant. And also, I find each arc unique on its own. Though slow, development is gradual and very in-character.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem is that many things are predictable or expected, or that some viewers might get irked with all the unnecessary crying. \\n\\n\r\nBut Clannad has some little elements as well that I can say...out of this world. It's interpretation differs from one to another and is a good connection to the individuality and emotions of a person.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt is also very familiar to the eyes for many animes featured Clannad's style but it is certainly refreshing. The environment and its colors are pleasing to the eyes with their mild tones. Probably the greatest asset of its animation is the characters. Different\"unique\" hair colors and styles has successfully distinguished one character from the other...and the eyes are gorgeous!\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nDango Dango Dango Dango Dango Dango Daikazoku...\\n\\n\r\nThe memorable thing about Clannad's music are its melodies and the ending song certainly makes it so. So my praise comes to \"Dango Daikazoku\" because it fits the series in a very cute and adorable; but the song somehow touches a different area and tells another meaning.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is appropriate though not entirely exceptional. And though I say Clannad's melodies are good, the background music every episode are almost the same, making it repetitive and predictable. They could have used different character themes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nLoving the series lies within loving its characters; and generally, all the protagonists are classic school characters:\\n\\n\r\na delinquent, yet helpful boy\\n\r\na boy who's the punching bag of female characters\\n\r\na girl with little self-confidence\\n\r\na cute yet mysterious girl\\n\r\na pair of contrasting sisters\\n\r\na shy and intelligent girl\\n\r\na tough and responsible girl\\n\\n\r\nThough many don't find them new (they're classic!), they somehow shine with some unique characteristics and actions that leaves a smile at one's face. Their interaction greatly plays a role in the drama of the genre. Many of them has hidden pasts and secrets that are revealed differently along the way. However, they are arguably generic and lacks development. Cuteness for the sake of it being cute may irk some viewers.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the central plot mover, Nagisa Furukawa is weak. The story is made predictable through her and what is accomplished in the whole series can be compressed in a few episodes or such. Everybody acts in an idealized fashion around her while her struggle simply lacks impact and nothing new.\\n\\n\r\nNotably, every one of them is kind-hearted. And they settle everything through teamwork and will-power. Don't expect intense humanism nor psychology. Expec\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is rather personal and its not the best basis in rating the series. However, I was not entertained by the countless \"I'm sorry!\" then  \"It's okay!\" dialogues and the lack of faults in the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an anime with dark themes, societal issues, intense drama, cool action and superb coolness Clannad is not for you. But if you want a relaxing anime with adorable characters that will make you reflect about your school life and the feelings of people then check this series out.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6\\n",

It was so silly, uninteresting, and so stereotyped that once I even have  fallen asleep. Honestly, I was just so bored with the storyline and so annoyed with some of the main characters that I just wanted to drop it sometimes.\r\nOk, then lets start with the story:\r\nThe cute looking boy meets just awfully ugly girl with the strange things in her head. Then she starts saying some senseless things. In the school he seesthat she's very lonely and he feels pity for her so they become friends. In this moments she can say that he's her first and most precious friend. Ok. Then she starts fall for him and he for her, but they are too shy and there's many other girls around him so she can't say that she likes him. Then it's showing that none of them can't suit him more than the main girl and in the end they confess to each other and end up dating. Such a silly, stereotyped drama and harem. I give the story 4/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOmg, I HATED the main girl Furukawa, Nagisa. You just can't imagine how annoying she was. Like an eyesore. \\n\r\nOther girls was ok. Especially Kyou. She was very cute and cool. \\n\r\nTomoya is the best. I very liked his personality and you know he was the one of the reasons why I watched the anime untill the end. [fangirl] He looks so cute",

            "content": "Tomoya Okazaki is a Highschool student who lives with his farther. Their relationship has progressed to the point where they're both strangers to one another. One morning on his way to school he meets a girl Nagisa Furukawa. The two befriend one another and over time the two help each other along the way in various tasks as their relationship continues to grow. \r\nIt\u2019s finally time to review this show after months of debating. \r\nStory:\r\nThe story follows our main protagonist Tomoya Okazaki, a delinquent who is frequently late to school, has bad grades and consistently gets into fights with others. It just so happened tobe a spot of luck that he meets the main heroine who would help change his life, Nagisa Furukawa. This shy and reserved girl happened to be speaking to herself whilst on her way in to school was surprised to see Tomoya standing by offering words of comfort. \\n\\n\r\nThat was the pinnacle moment that set the relationship between the two in motion as well as the rest of the series. From there on Tomoya and Nagisa help each other and help other friends along the way which helps to further strengthen the bond between Nagisa and Tomoya. \\n\\n\r\nStory arcs for characters like the Ibuki sisters, Nagisa and the drama club, Kotomi and her past and helping Tomoyo to become school president all contribute towards helping Tomoya become a better and happier person. I would get into more detail about each of the story arcs but that could create spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nTomoya at first is portrayed as a distant guy who seems out of touch with people. It\u2019s only after being with Nagisa that we see the stark contrast as to what he is like before. His interactions with all of the characters are very interesting as you can see how he treats each individual and how he regards the people closest to him. For example his relationship with Youhei Sunohara is very relaxed and Tomoya often tends to tease him, however the two have a strong relationship which is later addressed in the second season. When you compare the relationship with Youhei to his relationship with Ryou Fujibayashi, it just appears to be very uncomfortable and often forced at times. It is very heart warming to see how Tomoya grows as a character and the selflessness of his acts always turns out to be worth the effort. \\n\\n\r\nNagisa Furukawa is a shy and introverted girl. Now since I\u2019m a big fan of the show i always here people saying what a dull and boring character she is, but i disagree with that. Nagisa is a very kind and caring girl. She doesn't often get angry and when she does its just adorable. Her determination is very admirable. She is always empathetic of others and is a very selfless person. Nagisa is the sense of normality that Tomoya has been searching for and you can see his life approaching normal from the time they spend together.\\n\\n\r\nThe last mentionable character for me is Youhei Sunohara. Essentially the comic relief character Youhei is a constant presence of laughs for the show. He is similar to Tomoya because of their situations and that\u2019s how the two became friends. He is a punching bag for a couple of the female characters in the show and he just can't seem to catch a break with woman. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI'd have to say that the art was the weak point of the show. The background wasn't done that well and you can notice this when looking at buildings various street items. The animation was exceptional, i couldn't find much to fault with it, but it wasn't by any means extravagant. The designs of the characters... well its Key animation so expect Moe looking characters with big eyes and who all have the same face essentially. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI enjoyed the soundtrack for this show and the softer tones frequently used in the opening scenes were very calming and nice. The opening for the show was very well done, but from time to time i skipped it. The ending sequence was a lullaby song called 'Dango Daikazuku, which was very peaceful and a highlight for the series for me. It was something i couldn't skip once. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nTo say I enjoyed this series would be very undermining. This show demonstrated to me the power of friendship, the bonds between people and how a lucky meeting with someone can change your life. This show brought out so many emotions in me which I didn\u2019t think it was possible to have. I felt what the characters felt and while I\u2019m always hoping for the show to give Youhei I break, I just fell in love with this. This isn\u2019t by any means a perfect show, everything has its flaws, but perfection is only what you make of it and to me this show is perfect. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI give this show a well deserved 9/10 and a place in my heart forever. This show isn\u2019t for everyone. Those who have seen shows like Air or Kanon 2006 may not regard this as a big deal. If you are not a fan of romance anime this also won\u2019t be for you. I recommend this show to those looking for a sweet and heart warming romance anime with excellent character relationships. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading guys; I had a few tears well up in my eyes whilst writing this.I plan to review the second season soon. See you later and have a nice day! \\n\\n",

            "content": "Ok, so this is my first anime review. After hearing many people rave about this so-called \"great\" anime, I thought that I would give my input on what I personally thought of this show.\nThis anime is supposed to be really emotional and tear-jerking, but the only tears that I experienced were tears of boredom! I had to sit and suffer through the whole series at an anime club meeting because I really had no where else to go. I was trying hard to get into the series, but I just couldn't, and here's why:\nStory: Story? What story?! There's no real story here! Just some dudehelping a bunch of girls with their emotional problems! You call that a story?! Although I suppose the question posed is which girl he will end up with in the end (By the way, I already know who he ends up with in the Afterstory just from reading the synopsis, but I won't spoil anything and I don't intend to watch Afterstory). It sounds like the synopsis to, oh, I dunno...pretty much every other harem out there! By the way, I hate harem with a burning passion and I'm sorry,  but this anime is really no acception. The only difference is that this is harem makes a desperate attempt to try to be \"meaningful\" but fails horribly (I will explain why later).\\n\\n\nArt: The colors are pleasing on the eyes and the scenery is well-lighted. Unfortunately, neither of those things can make up for the utterly generic designs of the characters. Every character basically looks the bloody same! The only real differences would be the hair and eye color! What's especially disturbing is how sickingly cutesy and moe everyone looks. There's no variety! I mean, C'MON, you need ugly characters to balance out the cute and pretty ones (at least that's how I see it).\\n\\n\nSound: Nothing too memorable here either. I only found the \"Dango\" ending mildly amuzing, but's that's about it. \\n\\n\nCharacter: They say you can have best and most original storyline in the world, but without good characters to move the story along, you've got NOTHING. And this especially rings true with me. See, this is the major problem I have with the series: the CAST! Most of them failed to impress me and draw my interest. For one, the main character Tomoya has no personality whatsoever! He's nothing more than a vessel for his female classmates to dump all of their emotional baggage onto. And the other characters are pretty much card-board cutouts of character archetypes from other harem shows like Air and Kanon. There's really nothing special about them. Most of them are dull and flat. The only somewhat interesting one was Tomoyo, after I've seen her beat up that gang of boys. I thought that was pretty badass and was pretty much the highlight of the show for me. \\n\\n\nEnjoyment: As I was saying earlier, this show was obviously created to be an emotional tear-jerker and, therefore, \"meaningful\". I, however, wasn't moved one bit. The characters emotions just seemed so fake and artificial that it was really hard for me to care about them, especially since most of the characters don't appeal to me in the first place. The creators' attempt at trying to create pathos just failed for me. I found this show to be pretentious, contrived, and boring. Sure, there were a few comedic moments, but they were too few in number and couldn't compensate for all the sappy, corny melodrama of sob backstories in this show. If the show had a better cast, more comedy, and real raw emotions instead of the characters just simply sitting perfectly still telling their stories, I probably would have enjoyed the series a lot more. \\n\\n\nOverall: If you're a drama fanatic and you like moe and emo characters, then this is the show for you! As for me, I wish I'd have gotten all those hours of my time back because I thought it was pointless, sacarine, moe fluff and I really don't get all the hype behind it! As I see it, it's really no different than anything else out there.",

            "content": "I can already tell people are expecting a very trollish review but to me, this is my most unenjoyed and possibly most hated anime of all time. Lets just get into the review though shall we? Also this is for clannad not after story. after story was okay but I am treating it as its own thing.\r\nStory 2\\10\r\nI mean it was your normal slice of life anime but even for that the story was pretty bad. It never had a main girl besides attending school and for a slice of life, it made absolutely no sense since some paranormal stuff were happening like ghost girlin the first arc. Not the worst story but it was basically go to school and lets try to tug on your hear strings while being funny which ultimately felt more like watamote to me than comic relief. Worst part of all is that everything was predictable for me right down to the smallest detail not because I am good at that it just felt like where else would they go with that. There are other problems but that would contain spoilers so I will cap it right here.\\n\\n\r\nArt 2\\10\\n\r\nNow its fine if you thought the art was good, but I have seen clannad fans acting like the art was perfect and from what I have heard \"should be put in a museum\". Now comparing this to other animes made from kyoko animation, it is definitely the worst product I have seen from them animation wise. I have no idea why eyes were too big but that is just one thing. My biggest problem was that it all felt choppy. For the year 2007, if felt like so many other animes either brought something new to the table when it came to animation or were simply better so for the year 2007 it just fell short. \\n\\n\r\nSound 2\\10\\n\r\nNow I do my research most of the time, but for this one thing I am about to say I did not. What I really disliked was the fact that they had one track play for about 25% of the time and it got really annoying to me. It was just unmemorable to me in general but at the end of the day its just music preferences. If you thought the music was better I understand why.\\n\r\nCharacters 1\\10\\n\r\nFinally I get to be salty. The majority of characters were flat out trash\\generic and I will go over all of them individually. Going to go in no particular order though\\n\\n\r\nFuko Ibuki 1\\10\\n\r\nevery time she came up I just wanted to cringe. Throughout all episodes even after her arc she would appear for short periods of time with the same wooden starfish joke and it was just unfunny to eventually being cringey or I would flat want to skip it.Nothing really to that character besides a cheap trick to pull on your heart strings \\n\r\nNagisa 5\\10\\n\r\nNothing really wrong with her besides being the generic shy girl\\sickly one. She had her good moments nothing really to say besides I wish every other character was more like her so I can give a better score\\n\r\nFujibayasha twins\\n\r\nThe two purple hair girls in short, one was generic shy one and the other one was basically your hey look I can beat up our mc a few times I am a generic tsundere Just generic dating sim girls but worse which makes sense since this was a VN before an anime.\\n\r\nSunoharah\\n\r\nBasically your generic best friend comic relief who is a huge pervert and all girls hate him just the same old jokes for every upisode got very annoying.\\n\r\nKotomi 4\\10\\n\r\nHer arc was the least painful thing to sit on and after that they toss her away. she was the quiet library girl typical generic shit you would think with a sad backstory. Not a bad character but nothing really special besides one thing I really liked. She was the only girl not thirsty for our MC 100 percent of the time. I liked how she needed to be worked for and even than she likes him like every other girl but she is not slobbering all over him.\\n\r\nTomoya\\n\r\n1\\10\\n\r\nI can say I enjoyed this character the second least. Generic hey I can beat up everyone in the school and 1v50 rival gangs but inside I feel insecure. Just horrible character throughout everything.\\n\r\nTomoya 1\\10\\n\r\nOur main MC oh yea in a nutshell generic MC of any harem like anime with the hey look I am depressed. Nothing stands out with him and his backstory is nothing really but does explain how he became a delinquent. \\n\r\nOverall I just could not like most of the cast they all did not ever feel important to me.\\n\\n\r\nFinal judgment 1\\10\\n\r\nFirst off even if you put this review as not helpful or hate em general since clannad fans a bit unrational at times. I like animes like this I usaully give most slice of lifes a 4-7 rating or if it has lots of emotion like anohana, or your lie in april, I give them very high scores 8-10. Point of all that was showing that its not because I dislike animes like this its just this particular anime I will never get why its popular. I believe just a theory here but it was good for its time and characters like that fit the bill for that time. I see most people who watch clannad now of days really hate it or simply could not get through it which I had the same problem but eventually did. Mostt fans are people who grew up with clannad so maybe its a generation thing and for some reason even though I watched it maybe 09 or something I just simply hated it. \\n",

            "content": "Visual novel adaptations are something that I'm not particularly fond of, especially slice-of-life romance visual novel adaptations. Why? Well... more often than not, a harem ends up inadvertently forming due to the fact that the adaptation in question is trying to cover so many stories at once to the point where it sends off some rather bizarre messages and implications. You want a good example of what I'm talking about? Let's take a look at Clannad: one of the most popular visual novel adaptations of recent years and one that has left me with some SERIOUSLY mixed feelings.\r\nBefore I go any further, I just wantto take the time to explain the nuances of visual novels to those of you who aren't familiar. If you're a VN addict, you can just skip this paragraph. Basically, visual novels make you play through the story and based on the choices you make, you go down a specific \"route.\" If you go down one \"route,\" you cannot go down the others unless you start from square one again. This is especially the case with slice-of-life romance visual novels like Clannad, where you're introduced to multiple girls but you can only pick one girl at the end of it all. \\n\\n\r\nSlice-of-life romance visual novel adaptations end up trying to cover all of the girls' stories throughout the course of the show. Key word: trying. The biggest problem that visual novel adaptations have is the fact that anime as a medium does NOT have an answer to certain visual novel nuances. Because visual novels work in such a way where you're supposed to play through the story and you end up going down routes, it's only natural for characters and such to be thrown to the wayside since it's expected for you to play through the other routes if you want the full story. This nuance does NOT translate over to an anime context at all, and it's the biggest reason as to why I can't get on with Clannad.\\n\\n\r\nClannad focuses on Tomoya Okazaki who is a delinquent high school student who hates the town he lives in. Over the course of the story, he happens across the various girls that he attends school with and ends up helping them through various issues and problems that they face. All things considered, the set-up we have here is average but it's still a workable premise. However, Clannad's visual novel roots REALLY affect the story in quite a few negative ways. For starters: Tomoya meets a girl named Nagisa in the beginning of the story and their interactions in the beginning of the first episode make it obvious that these two will have a thing going on.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem with that is the fact that Nagisa gets shafted to the side so that KyoAni can adapt the other girls' stories from the visual novel. Why is this an issue? Well... it shouldn't come off as a surprise that all of the girls in the visual novel will inevitably have some romantic involvement with the player character, so whenever KyoAni is adapting one girl's story, all the other girls get thrown to the wayside JUST to adapt that specific girl's story. More often than not, Nagisa ends up getting relegated to a side character role for half the series. Keep in mind: she's supposed to be Tomoya's main love interest... at least, that's what's implied.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not even like the events that transpired previously are even kept in memory throughout the show. I wouldn't mind it so much if that was the case. Tomoya literally moves from girl to girl without so much as a second thought and seemingly without remembering what just transpired previously. So right off the bat, I'm not particularly fond of him. What's more is that it's never explicitly mentioned whether or not what just went down was purely platonic or not. I wouldn't mind it so much if I at least knew that Tomoya had no romantic interest with the girl he was currently helping or whatever. But no, there's always gotta be some damn romantic subtext going on in each girl's arc... despite the fact that it's so painfully obvious that Nagisa is the one who Tomoya really likes.\\n\\n\r\nTaking a break from inadvertent harems caused by visual novel roots, there are quite a few other problems that Clannad has on the whole. The comedic relief in Clannad is akin to what you'd find in Kanon mixed with a small dash of what you'd find in Love Hina. Essentially, we have one character who can't catch a break and is always on the receiving end of physical abuse from various girls (Sunohara), the wise yet obnoxious guy (Akio), the airhead girl with an irritating running gag/quirk (Sanae/Fuko), and so on and so forth. It was charming for the first 5-6 episodes, but it just got REALLY annoying and repetitive after that point. It doesn't help that the comedy keeps popping up to such a large degree to the point where it would interfere with any sort of drama that this show would have.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that drives me up a wall with Clannad is the moe. I know that moe is Kyoto Animation's signature, but I swear... EVERY SINGLE FEMALE CHARACTER IS MOE. Big eyes that take up 50% of their heads and also stare into your soul, tiny noses/mouths, high-pitched voices, certain character quirks and the like are commonplace across the Kyoto/KEY trilogy and it never ceases to leave me with some horrendously mixed feelings. On the one hand: KyoAni was simply translating the character designs from the Clannad visual novels, and seem to have done more than a fair job at it judging by the screenshots I've seen. On the other hand, I can't take any of these girls seriously BECAUSE of the moe. They're cute and endearing, yes but they're cute and endearing like beagle puppies and not actual humans to me. Is that horribly sexist of me to say? Possibly. But then again, I tend to overthink these things so maybe I'm just making a mountain out of a moehill (get the joke?).\\n\\n\r\nI could tolerate this however, were it not for the fact that Clannad semi-regularly brings drama into the picture without any sense of foreshadowing whatsoever. This is most prominent with Kotomi and Nagisa's arcs. Now, Kotomi and Nagisa are relatively silly characters with quirky yet endearing personalities. However, their arcs dive into their back-story and as it turns out, the circumstances of their childhoods aren't all sunshine and rainbows. The only problem is the fact that last episode, we saw them being all moe, jovial and shit. You get where I'm going with this? These moments were specifically designed to be emotionally manipulative in the worst possible ways. I'd be lying through my teeth if I said I didn't feel something, but it wasn't because I found myself truly invested with the characters. It was because these moments were specifically designed to tug at my heart strings in the most shallow and manipulative ways possible.\\n\\n\r\nLet's compare this to a moment from one of my all-time favourite animated films that actually DID leave me tearing up because I was invested with the characters, Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. This movie follows Bruce Wayne's life shortly before he became Batman and how he almost completely abandons his plan of becoming a crime fighter when he meets a woman named Andrea Beaumont and falls in love. At one point in the film, he's torn between his plans of becoming a crime fighter and actually living a happy life to the point where he actually visits his parents' graves and apologises for not going through with the plan because he \"didn't count on being happy.\"\\n\\n\r\nI was actually invested with what Bruce was going through for four reasons: First off, feeling guilty for being happy is incredibly commonplace to people who've gone through a lot of strife in their lives. Second, this is the first time we ever see Bruce expressing any emotion that isn't anger or frustration which he rarely did in Batman TAS. Third, the inflections in Kevin Conroy's voice as he was delivering his lines actually did capture the guilt that Bruce feels. Fourth (and the reason why Kotomi partially escapes my ire): I actually have lost a parent so I know full well how Bruce feels. Say what you will about Batman being some childish superhero, but Bruce Timm, Paul Dini et al did their best to portray Bruce in a realistic manner, which they successfully did.\\n\\n\r\nWas there ANY moment in this season of Clannad where I remotely felt anything similar? The answer is a resounding \"NO.\" Even Kotomi's arc which I can vaguely relate to was done in such a way where she wasn't painted as a real human being. She was portrayed as a moeblob in need of someone to hold her and console her during those moments of drama/tragedy. As someone who actually has lost a parent, I can safely say that Kotomi's portrayal was nothing short of insulting. I don't take umbrage with Kotomi herself since her various quirks and such (i.e. introverted behaviour, lacklustre social skills) are within the realm of probability for someone with her predicament. \\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER, when you take such a character, say she went through a massive tragedy like that, try to resolve all of that shit within the span of 4-5 episodes AND have the audacity to throw such a character to the wayside and not make her a bigger player in the events that happen on screen after that point, THAT'S where I draw the line. Nagisa's arc was SLIGHTLY more tolerable because of how Akio handled everything, but it's still not something I'm quick to endorse because of how Nagisa was characterised (which I'll get to in the next section).\\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters are concerned, there isn't a lot in the way of originality. Like I said before, we're dealing with an SOL romance visual novel adaptation, and the characters end up falling into a great many clich\u00e9s because of said visual novel roots. First up, we have Tomoya Okazaki. If you've watched Haruhi Suzumiya, Kanon 2006, Chu-2, or pretty much anything else produced by Kyoto Animation that has a lead male protagonist, you'll know his general disposition: he's sarcastic, snarky, and has to put up with a bunch of crap from moeblobs. Similarly, we have Sunohara: his best friend who takes it upon himself to act like a complete and total moron in the most ridiculous ways possible.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as Tomoya goes, I don't really care much for him in this season of Clannad. Now, Tomoya on his own is fairly likeable albeit generic but where his characterisation really falters is when he's helping another girl. At first, I didn't really have much of a problem with this because I was ignorant of the fact that Clannad was a visual novel adaptation and I really didn't find out about that until I was half-way through After Story. HOWEVER... the more that I dwell upon Tomoya's behaviour in this season of Clannad, the less I find myself liking him. \\n\\n\r\nKnowing the fact that the girl that Tomoya is interacting with would've inevitably had some romantic involvement in the source material something that really just drives me up a wall. Thankfully Clannad wasn't adapted from an eroge visual novel like Air or Kanon so the implications aren't TOO severe but at the same time... I just can't ignore that fact. It's like, I know that Nagisa is the one he'll ultimately choose but seeing him move from girl to girl is something that I take umbrage with on so many levels.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other girls, well... I already covered how the moe affects my opinion of them, so I won't go into too much detail about that. However, there are quite a few problems that the girls have with their characterisations that don't pertain to the moe. For instance, Clannad's visual novel roots end up shafting various characters to the side so that a particular girl's story can be covered which I've stated earlier. However, the amount of time each girl receives varies quite a bit. For example, the twins Kyo and Ryo were relegated to the roles of side characters for the vast majority of the season and it wasn't until the Kyo/Ryo OVA at the end of After Story where they finally received some time in the spotlight (similar situation with Tomoyo, but she actually received more screen time). Say what you will about Kanon, but at least each girl barring Nayuki received roughly the same amount of screentime (4-5 episodes each).\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is the fact that certain characters feel rather... familiar, to say the least if you've watched one of the other Kyoto/KEY series beforehand. For example, Nagisa and Fuko are quite literally expies of Shiori and Ayu from Kanon. Much like Shiori, Nagisa is a sickly character who misses quite a lot of school due to her illness with a segment of out-of-place drama, came close to dying, and were saved by a bullshit happy ending. As for Fuko's resemblance to Ayu, let's see: there's a verbal tic (Fuko refers to herself in the third person while Ayu tends to say uguu while sad/frustrated) and astral projections involved. I'll just let you experience both if you want to validate my claims.\\n\\n\r\nNow we come to Akio and Sanae, Nagisa's parents. As far as they go, Akio is passable but Sanae just gets under my skin. She has this running gag where she can't bake for shit and whenever someone insults her baked goods, she runs out crying only for Akio to shove a bunch of bread in his mouth and chase after her. Sanae doesn't really have a lot in the way of a purpose other than to be a MILF/running gag machine and it isn't until after Episode 16 of After Story where she actually has a worthwhile purpose, but I'll get into THAT can of worms when I review After Story.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as Akio goes, he's likeable yet annoying. That's as best as I can phrase it. He's loud, hammy, and obnoxious like someone such as Tamaki-senpai from Ouran HSHC, but that's kind of the reason why I like him. Some of the dialogue and interactions between him, Tomoya, and everyone else was more than enough to make me smile and just seeing him on-screen was more than enough to make me briefly forget what just transpired a few minutes ago, if only for an instant. What I also like about Akio is the fact that he knows when to cut the bullshit and take things seriously like in Nagisa's arc and for that, I applaud him.\\n\\n\r\nMoving away from all of the ranting/babbling about the story and characters, let's take a look at Clannad's production. This was made by Kyoto Animation, and the production values of Clannad really do reflect that quite a bit. Can you really go wrong with a company that has brought us visual treats like the entire Haruhi franchise and Chu-2? All of the backgrounds have an amazing amount of detail put into them and everything is animated with no stutters/jitters and very few drops in qualilty.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the art direction and animation really shine is where we see segments of a little girl who's the only human left in the world that also builds a robot made out of scrap metal. Yes, it is just as bizarre as it sounds and these segments are pretty much pointless until the end of After Story. But that's beside the point, we're talking about the art/animation in these segments. Basically, everything is rendered entirely in CG and for what it does, these segments are amazing to look at and are animated beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER... there are three things that keep Clannad from being a masterpiece in the visual department: First, the moe (which I already covered). Second, the usage of CG (which I'll cover in a minute or two) causes the animation quality to drop in certain places to preserve the budget. Third, some character designs were actually recycled from Kanon. For example, Tomoya and Sunohara are quite literally palette swaps of Yuichi and Kitagawa from Kanon. Don't even get me started on how Akio is basically an older-looking version of Yuichi/Tomoya but with a deeper voice.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the CG, well it works amazingly well for the segments with the girl and the scrap robot. However, Kyoto Animation decided to shoehorn in some CG in the actual show every now and then, and sometimes it just gets rather... off-putting, to say the least. Like there are moments where I'm wondering \"how much money did you guys save by rendering a table fan in CG rather than just using plain old digital animation?\" CG is pretty expensive stuff, so guess what? The animation quality ends up dropping for a minute or two just to preserve the budget for the CG. Thankfully, Kyoto Animation isn't like Gonzo and they do actually prioritise what's important and what isn't, but I can't help but feel that they were being a bit too frivolous.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the art/animation, I don't really have as much praise for the OST. While there were quite a few BGM tracks I liked, it really just served as a complement to what was going on and didn't stand out on its own in any way possible which is quite a shame since a memorable OST is necessary for a romance story to truly shine. The OP theme was something that grated on my ears somewhat, but the ED theme, \"Dango Daikozaku\" was something that I was quite fond of, if only because of the fact that I was grinning like a lunatic whenever Nagisa was singing it in the show because it was so adorable.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice-acting, I can't comment on the Japanese voice-acting so much because I was watching the show subbed so the voices faded into the background but I will say this: Tomoya's VA sounds suspiciously similar to Yuichi's VA in Kanon. The English dub for Clannad is fair enough I guess. Sentai isn't exactly known for making mind-blowingly amazing dubs like Funimation is but at least we've got a few voice actors/actresses outside the realm of Funimation which is always a nice treat. On another note, we also have have the almighty queen of emoting, Luci Christian voicing Nagisa. If you're debating sub or dub, I'd suggest trying the first episode dubbed and see if it works for you. If Luci Christian's performance isn't enough for you, watch it subbed. If it is, dub all the way.\\n\\n\r\nSo... would I say that I enjoyed Clannad? Yes and no. Yes in the sense that it was idle entertainment for whenever I was bored and I wanted to kill an hour or two and there were quite a few moments that I genuinely did enjoy. No in the sense that the more I think about Clannad, the less I like the series as a whole. I genuinely do enjoy After Story but in order for me to truly \"appreciate\" it, I need to take THIS series into account, which leaves me with all kinds of mixed feelings. Maybe if I don't overthink these things, I'd like Clannad as much as everyone else does, but unfortunately... I am an overthinker.\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, Clannad is a par-for-the-course SOL romance visual novel adaptation which doesn't exactly have a lot to stand on. If you're expecting something to make you cry or whatever, that shit happens in After Story. So why shouldn't you skip this season and start with the arguably superior After Story? Eh... I can't think of any reason other than having more context for the events that go on in After Story and also the fact that if you get attached to the characters in the first season, the shit that goes down in After Story will be even more intense (spoiler: I couldn't get attached to the characters here, so After Story was a swing and a miss for me). High scores in art/animation in sound and average scores in story, characters, and enjoyment bring this series out to an even 6.2, which is pretty fair given all of the shit I said so far. With that, I'm out. Peace.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\\n\r\nAt the time of this review, Clannad is licensed by Sentai Filmworks. There are two releases available if I'm not mistaken, sub-only (which Sentai has stopped printing) and sub+dub (what is currently available). The only problem is the fact that the subtitles on the official Clannad DVDs (and the Hulu version if I'm not mistaken) fucking suck. They're rife with spelling/grammar errors and I do believe there was a mistranslation or two as well (don't get me started on how the subtitles are also big, yellow, and ugly). For something that you have to pay money for... it's pretty fucking shit.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also the matter of the way Sentai used to package the discs. They used to come in one of those spindle cases where all the discs are stacked together on one side of the box and a rectangular wad of styrofoam on the other (presumably to prevent the case from sagging or something). If you're not marathoning it, you have to actually take each individual disc out to reach the one you want which seriously risks damaging the discs.\\n\\n\r\nI am aware that Sentai has since re-released it on Blu-ray and the case is MUCH better where each disc comes on its own slot in the case, so I highly recommend getting the new release if you're planning on buying Clannad. I also ended up re-watching Clannad on Amazon Prime, and the subtitles are noticeably better than what I had to put up with on the DVDs but again... not too sure if Amazon Prime was using the Blu-ray release or if that's just something Prime came up with on their own. Whatever, I digress. On with the review!",

            "content": "Here's the central problem with Clannad: it wants to tug your heartstrings, so it doesn't think about anything else. Unfortunately for this show, this means that it ends up being utterly contrived, unrealistic, and outright stupid.\r\nThis show expects us to believe that teenage girls act like five-year-olds. It expects us to care about these infantile, one-dimensional characters. It expects us to have genuine emotional reactions to the 'blossoming relationships' between our bland protagonist and these excuses for characters.\r\nIs this too harsh? Let's look at the individual components that MAL expects us to rate anime by.\r\nSTORY: To be fair, the anime didn't have much to workwith, given that it was based on the original VN plot. Still, the outlandish (one word: Fuuko) and emotionally manipulative plot elements (most of the backstories that were explored) weakened what might otherwise have been a sweet, unpretentious slice-of-life drama/romance.\\n\\n\r\nI mean: a story about a girl who is shy and has trouble making friends? Yeah, cool, you can watch Kimi no Todoke or something. A story about a girl with Mysterious Anime Disease who has the intellectual capacity of a child? Sorry, it's not working for me. [4/10]\\n\\n\r\nART: High budget, great production values and art direction. Squishy moe character designs may not be everyone's cup of tea (Sanae looks barely older than Nagisa), but again, that comes with the territory. If anything, this aspect of Clannad makes me despair, because I can think of a lot of better anime series that deserve to have this sort of budget. [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Evocative without being overdramatic, for the most part. Unfortunately, all the female characters sound like babies. [6/10]\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: This is probably the greatest problem I have with Clannad, and again, it's thanks to the source material. Few of the characters get much development. All of them (the female ones, anyway) exhibit some degree of fanboy-pandering. Kyou's tsundere-ness, Fuuko's quirkiness, Nagisa's unending sweetness, etc. - not to mention the fact that Fuuko, Kotomi and Nagisa, at least, sound at least half their age. Their childish and insecure natures (especially early in the series) make for unrealistic characters - and therefore compromise this show's unrelenting attempts at making us care about them.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also hard to understand Tomoya's motivations at the start of the series, i.e. why he even bothered with/cared about Nagisa et al. We get no insight into his motivations at all. Why would a so-called delinquent suddenly take up this project of helping a random girl he's never met before? Why does he find her interesting? What is the point? [3/10]\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Obviously higher if you're a moe fan, but those who derive little enjoyment from watching cute girls doing cute things might find this series rather trying.\\n\\n\r\nThose who watch anime with their brain switched on will find this series trying.\\n\\n\r\nThose who think that female characters should actually resemble, you know, real people... yeah, don't watch this show, it'll make you rage. [5/10]\\n\\n\r\nIf Clannad weren't so obviously manipulative, it might be a better series. Which is not to say that the series is obviously cynical - on the contrary, I think it exhibits a genuine warmth that lesser harem-type series lack. Yet the series ultimately feels contrived and heavy-handed, and its unrealistic characters undermine its would-be heart-warming nature.",

            "content": "\"Poignant. Compelling. Heartbreaking. Clannad is one of the most cherished anime of all times.\"\r\nThe first time I watched Clannad was back in 2008, and I just finished re-watching it for the 3rd time this past few days. Now I realize that will take years before I watch something that does the same impact on me like this anime did. I was moved by it the first time I watched, and the third as well, but surprisingly in a different way. Throughout all anime history this is one of the most notorious series in the romance/drama genre, not only for the emotional load it carries butalso for the effects and different reactions it causes on the people who watched it.\\n\r\nThe quote at the beginning of the review is from the description of the blu-ray edition. Of course they wouldn't bad-mouth their own release on the disc cover, but it's so honest and true that I couldn\u2019t find a better way to introduce this review (I just removed the \"and now it's available in HD!\" part, obviously.) \\n\\n\r\nI'd like to start this review, if I may, going straight to the point; the main reason why some people avoid Clannad.\\n\r\n\"It's too cute.\"\\n\r\nYes man, it is. I agree with you. There were times I thought to myself \"this would never happen in the real world\" but what is the problem? Appreciating these beautiful moments won't bruise you. \"You'll cry\" is also a sentence often read in reviews. I admit, I wrote it on my After Story review, but it's not mandatory! Nobody is obligated to cry or feel sad, it's just that the anime is so strong that it makes a lot of people cry. Even if you're not really into drama or romances, give it a try. If you dislike then drop the 2nd season, but complete this one! It's one in a lifetime experience, I dare to say you'll enjoy at least half of the show.\\n\r\nThe Clannad collection is undoubtedly a well known anime. Even though, the After Story receive much more attention than the first season. Mostly because it's more \"touching\" than its predecessor, but it wouldn't be the same and wouldn't even exist without this prequel. It's the entire set that makes Clannad the masterpiece it is.\\n\r\nSome people end up watching After Story before the first series. The storyline is set in a way it's not necessary watch the first season to understand what is going on, the characters are introduced again and it's a different theme. However, I cannot guarantee that you will enjoy the show as much as someone who watched the 1st season before.\\n\\n\r\nClannad is something I would recommend even to a friend who have never watched any kind of anime. There is no need to have a \"anime background\" in order to enjoy it, it's something everyone, without exceptions, can watch. Despite the genre, age, tastes... There is no gore, violence, profanity, battles... it's just the classical slice-of-life humor mixed with a lovely romance, that proves how strong some stories can be by themselves without any kind of \"attractive\" or fan-service.  \\n\r\nDo you know anyone who's a little depressed and is now reading some kind of self-help book trying to see the \"beauty of life\"? Recommend to him/her this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to define this series with one word, I'd say it's \"charming\". It's an anime to be enjoyed, appreciated. All the aspects of it, including art, soundtrack, characters but specially story.\\n\r\nWhen we were little, we used to find everything amazing, even the most stupid and simple thing was something amusing. We had a hell of a time with friends, laughing for no reason... But, suddenly it's all gone. \\n\r\nAll those great mementos are now just vague memories and you're stuck in a boring and endless routine. This are the thoughts of our male protagonist, Tomoya Okazaki. And this little fragment from the first scene gives you already an idea of how the story will progress. However these are also thoughts we all have inside of us, and that's why Clannad's story becomes so realistic at some point, because it's close to reality, a reality some people have experienced themselves. \\n\r\nDon't worry, this sadness isn't the main focus of the story. Clannad is a heartwarming tale. Our protagonist will make many friends along the way, and with them new situations will appear, turning his lonely days into something much more enjoyable, happy, and also mysterious. \\n\r\nJun Maeda and the screenwriters from Key did a marvelous job with the development of some points from the story, keeping some surprises hidden until the very end.\\n\\n\r\nClannad is a character-driven anime. Since it's based in a Visual Novel by Key, KyoAni decided to maintain the same setting, that's why it is divided into \"arcs\", each one focusing in a specific character.\\n\r\nWhen you say on a review that one series has these arcs, a lot of people usually interprets it with a prejudgment that it's bad because they think it will completely focus in one character during some episodes and leave the rest like if they were in \"standby\". This is not how it works with this series. Clannad was divided into arcs because that's how the Visual Novel was done, it was already like this, KyoAni just decided to follow the order. Even though, these arcs are all tight together and some 'themes' are continuously being developed, sometimes on the background but also taking the main stage at some episodes.\\n\r\nWhile talking about characters, I must praise those who imagined and designed them. From my standpoint, they're original, unique.\\n\r\nNagisa, for example, has a strong personality but is easily turned down, she's caring but also very naive. It must seems incoherent but this is where things gets interesting. These characters' personalities aren't \"fixed\", and just like us, they change as the time passes by. Watching a character that's plain and you can predict its next action is boring. Stereotypes like the \"tsundere friend\" will always be present because in a way or another they're trademarks of slice-of-life. Even though, the way they're interpreted and the actions these characters take is what makes the difference between the average and the outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation has always impressed me with the visuals and the details you can get from their animes. As expected from a high budget company they have in their hands the most recent software. That said, the artwork was also a joy. It's common to see wallpapers of Clannad around the internet, just another proof of it.\\n\r\nThe placement and setting for the story was really well done, all the buildings and alleys seemed like a small countryside city. Same goes for the characters, they all have a clean and careful outline with that \"moe\" style KyoAni has. Like said before, KyoAni did an adaptation of the original story, so it means they had almost everything of the storyline done, this way they could focus on improving and include minor \"spoilers\" and visual jokes from the later chapters into the very first episodes which is great because when you finally get to those episodes, you have that d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu kind of feeling and remember they did hint you about that.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack chosen and created for this series is something to give praise. I was astonished with the OST. They included some really emotional piano pieces for the strong scenes but also relaxing songs for the happy moments. \\n\r\nAlthough, they did a huge mistake with the ED. Not that it was the wrong song, Dango Daikazoku is addictive and a cute melody, however, there were lots of emotional endings throughout the anime, but after that heartbreaking scene, they throw the usual ending theme. Ok, Dango is a great melody but it isn't perfect for every moment. You can't have a happy and a sad ending with the same song! In some scenes, it ruined the entire emotional atmosphere  that was built up. This would be one of the few reasons for me to remove some points from Clannad score. \\n\\n\r\nI once read this marvelous anonymous quote:\\n\r\n-\"Oh, now I understand why there are few doujinshi of this anime\" \\n\r\nand a caption followed: \"otaku after watching the complete Clannad series.\"\\n\r\nIt's true! The story is perfect the way it is, nobody wants to mess with it.\\n\r\nIt's a complicated thing to say \"that series is the best anime of all times\", this is something too relative. Even rankings like the one here on MAL aren't trustful. I'm not saying that it's wrong! It's just that these things are extremely relative since each website of anime has it own community and, as well, some differences in the rankings. Even though, there's one thing you can take as \"absolute\". If an anime is acclaimed by the majority of the critic during years it must mean it's good. I hope I was able to make a point, and at least convince some of you to watch it.\\n\\n\r\n[...] adfghkjgfdssSorry, just sweeping my tears of the keyboard.",

            "content": "I have to thank \"Clannad\", for increasing my Japanese vocabulary and introducing me to a new word. While watching \"Clannad\" at my local anime soc, I could feel a certain something radiating from it. I'd encountered similar feelings before from other anime, but never quite so strongly. By the end of it, I picked up a new word to go with that feeling.\r\nThat word is \"moe\". I'd never come across the word before \"Clannad\", and but I sure as hell knew it's meaning afterwards. It describes a feeling that originates from the sweetness of the female characters. But it's not a charming kind of sweetnessthat you get from, say, \"Aria\". It's an extreme kind of sweetness, the kind you get from gorging yourself on the icing from a cake, the kind of sweetness that makes your tooth ache and your stomach churn. I can't stand this kind of sweetness because it's artificial, arising from a cynical, calculated attempt on the makers part to portray the girls as cutely as possible. Taken to this kind of extremes, it has no real substance and serves only as an obstacle to good characterisation.\\n\\n\r\nYou can tell pretty quickly that \"Clannad\" is blatently based on a harem VN or a dating sim. The main protagonist doesn't waste much time hooking up with about 12 different girls. What's more, the character designs, with their various hair colour extracted from almost all major parts of the visible spectrum, are exactly what you'd expect from the source material. There's the Brown Haired Girl, the Blue Haired Girl (they don't even need names, and to be honest they don't deserve names), the Grey Haired Girl etc, and even a pair of Purple Haired Twins. In fact I'm surprised to see the roster is missing a Pink Haired Girl. Of course, a generically distinct personality is assigned to each girl. Now, \"generically distinct\" may sound like an oxymoron, but I assure you it is not. The girls' personalities are all distinct from one another, however they all conform to their own generic archetype that can be readily identified within about 20 seconds of their introduction. There's the Adorably-Childish Girl (aka Green Haired Girl), the Shy Girl (aka one half of the Purple Haired Twins), the Feisty Girl (aka the other half of the Purple Haired Twins) etc etc. Again, I'm surprised to see the roster missing a Ditzy Girl - maybe they deliberately missed one out in order to prevent the whole thing from becoming even more painfully transparent than it already is. It also soon becomes obvious that, though all the girls shows interest in the main character, for the purpose of the \"Clannad\" playthrough, er, I mean, storyline, the main character's \"target\" is Generically Sweet Girl (aka Brown Haired Girl).\\n\\n\r\nThough I guess \"Clannad\" is technically not quite a harem, since there's another guy in the cast besides the main character, it may as well be one, because the other guy in question qualifies as a man only by technicalities. Practically, he's more like some sub-human creature, perhaps on about the same level as a worm, and is suitably treated as one too. Most of the girls treat him with distain and none of them are interested in him in the slightest. To be fair, the main character himself isn't quite your average harem lead, and for this reason, I've given him some more respect than the others characters by actually looking up his name for the purpose of this review (I'm bad with Japanese names and can never remember them): he's called Okazaki Tomoya. For some reason I keep thinking he's called Kyon... I think it's because like Kyon from \"Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu\", he sticks out as the lone, sarcastic voice of relative reason amongst a sea of irrational madness. Anyway, I digress... as I was saying, what make Tomoya different from a typical harem lead is that although he is a bit of a good for nothing person, he's at least more charismatic and confident than that typical loser-but-nice stereotype that's recycled through most harems, and so you can at least kind of see why he's able to get on quite well with his, er, harem.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the insane amount of moe, another thing that stood out about \"Clannad\" (in a bad way) is the insane amount of heavy handed emotional manipulation injected into the show. This show has more of it than \"Saikano\", and THAT is saying something. I bristle at the sight of the slice-of-life tag attached to this title, because this show completely sacrifices any sort of realism associated with that genre in favour of trying to artificially invoke more emotions from the viewer with unbelivable and outrageously melodramatic storylines. The \"tragic\" backstories for the various characters pasts are so contrived that at times it feels like a competition between them  to see which one can be more ridiculous and unrealistic. It's a competition that is eventually won by Blue Haired Girl's (aka Nerd Girl) backstory involving a teddy bear. It's a story that is so \"moving\" that it had everyone in the room bursting into tears. Tears of laughter that is. Moreover, most of the girls - Blue Haired girl being a prime example - simply disappears into the background once their part of the story is over, and the shift in focus from one girl to the next is so swift and ruthless I found it kind of off putting. What's the point of spending an arc fleshing out these characters if they simply get swept under the carpet again once their part of the story is over? Brown Haired Girl is probably the only person who's presence can be felt throughout the series, and that's only because she's obviously the girl who's gonna hook up with Tomoya's eventually (but don't worry, if you don't like this ending, Kyoto Animation has rather helpfully made several \"Clannad\" OVA's that are basically alternative playthroughs where Tomoya picks someone else).\\n\\n\r\nOnly one of the supposedly tragic situations did not come off as overly melodramatic, and that's the one involving Tomoya's family situation with his dad. However, it's side story that's really jarringly integrated into the show. It comes into the show's focus randomly with little apparent purpose. It also feels out of place when placed against the cheesily cheerful parts, and what's more did not really come to any conclusion. It's almost as though when given this piece of material with genuine potential, the makers of \"Clannad\" didn't quite know what to do with it. As a result it feels like a bit of a tag on without much purpose.\\n\\n\r\nI'm really glad that I watched this with my local anime society, because with my stubborness of finishing what I start, watching this whole thing through by myself probably would have killed me. I remember trying to catch up with the episodes on the weeks where I couldn't make it to the society showings, and I literally had to split each episode into two or three chunks to be able to complete it - I just couldn't stomach watching more than a few minutes of it at a time. And no wonder - with its sickeningly strong stench of moe, ludicrously contrived stories and array of cardboard template cut-outs masquerading as female characters, just what is there to like for someone who's not into moe or extremely sappy melodrama?",

            "content": "Clannad was an anime that didn't know what it wanted to be. It tried being a drama, romance, slice-of-life, and comedy all at the same time and just ended up becoming dumbed down.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nAs a romance, it was piss-poor with a mostly one dimensional cast of female characters with the exception of two that actually had personalities. For me, it failed as a drama. The first big arc is focused around a character that was extremely annoying. It made me not care at all about what happened and I had zero emotional connection to anything since that part. Clannad is primarily supposed to be aromance/drama but it best aspect is its average comedy/slice-of-life aspects. That is not a good thing. It had it's moments, but all those moments were comedic.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nThe fucking eyes were so bad. Okazaki's eyes looked fine, but why only him?\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nIt was okay.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nThe main love interest, Nagisa was one of the worst characters I've ever seen in anime. She's more one dimensional that a line. Throughout the whole anime Nagisa acts like a five year old child, never has any character development or changes. She is the biggest cause of Clannad's ruin. The only characters that make this anime watchable are the male characters Okazaki (main character) and Sunohara.The two female characters that have personality end up completely unimportant. Overall, over half the cast is useless.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\r\nI had to force myself through this. I'm not sure why Clannad is so praised. Yes, I've watched After Story. However this is isn't a review of After Story, it's a review of the first season (Not that After Story is much better). This season of Clannad fell flat is so many ways. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10",

            "content": "Clannad. Made as a visual novel by Key, made into an anime by Kyoto Animation. This combination has been seen twice before, in the series Air and Kanon. Both are well-known among anime fans, and mostly positively received. And anyone who has watched either or both of the two previously mentioned will definitely have their expetations of what Clannad will offer. These expectiations will probably, in a way, be fulfilled; yet Clannad is certain to sweep you along and astound it with its gripping tale. \r\nThe story itself is set to a small Japanese town, and a select few inhabitants of that town. The firstperson to note is Okazaki Tomoya, a high school senior notorious at school for being a tardy delinquent; always late for classes, if he shows up at all, and he surely doesn't care for anything. And while that is true, he isn't the kind of person who goes looking for fights and has a foul mouth. The reason for his current life situation is a complex one, but can be summarized as such: He's simply bored. Of going to school. Classes. The town he lives in. His home and drunkard father.\\n\\n\r\nThat however, changes drastically one day, when walking to school. he hears a girl mutter the word 'anpan' to herself. This draws on his curiosity, and before long, the two of them are talking to each other. The girl, Nagisa Furukawa, evidently mutters names of foods she likes, to give her the confidence to get through the day. She is currently repeating her senior year due to illness, and she has one thing she absolutely must do: Re-establish the school's drama club.\\n\\n\r\nTo do this she needs members. And before long herself and Tomoya are looking around the school for new members. And here the somewhat-standard harem cast is built up. The soon-to-be drama club members are for the most part girls, each with their distinct personality and quirks which probably aren't unknown to someone slightly experienced with this kind of anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe route it takes from here is, at its bones and skeleton, a standard visual novel approach. There are several story arcs covering various amounts of episodes; each arc focusing on a specific girl. Of course, this means that the girls have their problems and issues which they have to deal with. And our main characters do just that, by valiant effort to help their newfound friends. And a little bit of Dr. Phil mixed in. One of my pet peeves with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut from what we now know, it sounds like any other anime of this type. So what is it that sets Clannad apart from the rest, and elevates it above them? \\n\\n\r\nThe first answer would be the characters. Yes, they start out a bit clich\u00e9, in some ways, but that's not really a bad thing. Making totally original characters personality-wise nowadays isn't that easy after all. What Clannad does with the characters after their introduction, however, is amazing. Not only are their struggles portrayed excellently and grippingly, they develop into strong induvidials who are there for their friends, who can face the world and its hardships more openly.\\n\\n\r\nThe second answer lies in its themes. Here it completely blows everything else out of the water, because what the producers want to tell us through Clannad is realistic and believable what concerns both actual plot execution and message. What the characters do, I can belive. What they learn from their struggles, I can learn and take with me to real life. That's how strong Clannad's message is.\\n\\n\r\nMostly it's about family. What is a family? Who can be family? How important are bonds? What if you don't have proper family at home; only jerks with no right to call themselves your family? Clannad tells us that a family can be found anywhere; not only in our own home. The main characters of the show may just find their own little family together, as they work with the drama club. \\n\\n\r\nA character which I think deserves extra mention is Sunohara. He is in many ways the comedic relief person; when you see him around you expect something funny to happen. Or well, at least that's what you're supposed to do. But Sunohara isn't just a blond, shallow klutz. At times he really shines through with his deep character, proving that he, too, can be a capable supporter among his friends.\\n\\n\r\nAs most would expect of Kyoto Animation, the animation budget is all but slim. One of the things which makes Clannad so lifelike is the animation itself, through sheer quality. Lucid, vivid and soft colours makes sure the eye is pleased through gentle contrasts and lifelike static and non-static objects on-screen, be that walls, characters, cityscapes or other such things. The detail level is exceptionally high, which again contributes to that feeling of the series being alive. Clothing, furniture, decorations, it's all there and looking truly neat. But what contributes most to this feeling of being alive lies in the character motions. Not only are they fluid and pleasant to watch, they're abundant. You've most likely watched a series only to find that the characters walk stiffly, and when they talk they remain static during the whole conversation, save for maybe one or two motions. In Clannad, they swing their arms to be dramatic and to prove their points. They aren't static when jsut standing upright speaking. They do things during conversations which ensures that they seem more like real humans standing there than 2d anime characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what would a show be without its music? Just as the animation contributes to the series coming alive, the music does an outstanding job at amplifying the emotions portrayed. Many of the themes are dramatic, sad; this to reflect the overall sadness of Clannad. Yet there are other themes too which fit right in. The standard new day at school theme, some comedy-like themes, they are all there. And they are composed beautifully, making sure every mood swing and feeling sweeps your heart away, gripping at your innermost feelings of empathy and compasion for the characters. The opening theme, remixed from the game's counterpart, is a lovely upbeat theme mixing strings, a neat bass and percussion all mixed into an allegro which has interesting lyrics as the topping. The end theme is basically a metaphor for what goes on; the dango family representing Nagisa and the caring people around her. It is a very bittersweet tune, offering cuteness and melancholy all the same.\\n\\n\r\nAnd parallelling all that happens is the story of a girl in a world that has ended. A strange, mysterious world, where she is alone. All alone, savefor a doll she built from scrap metal. What this symbolizes and means, you can watch for yourself. Though, this side-story's relevance to the main plot is not revealed properly before the second season.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Clannad offered a very pleasant surprise to me; offering both enticing themes, a fresh plot and interesting, deep characters. Once during the season I also had to experience a tear making its way down my cheek. That's the kind of anime this is. If you haven't watched it, you should definitely give it a try.",

            "content": "\"Key's 1st non-adult visual novel proved to be a success.\"\r\nUnlike its two predecessors (Air and Kanon) that started out as H-Visual Novels, Clannad was released for all-ages and does not contain any fan service (although the selling point is still harem). Being Key's second longest work, Clannad is not a simple story that can be summarized in a mere 23 episodes TV series. As a result, Kyoto Animation released an additional 24 episodes in the sequel Clannad ~After Story~. As the third anime adaptations of Key visual novels, Clannad certainly is a must watch for all Air and Kanon fans.\r\nThe Clannad visual novel was splitinto two segments, \"School Life\" and \"After Story\". Clannad features the \"School Life\" segment, while the \"After Story\" segment is in Clannad ~After Story~. Each segment is further subdivided into arcs about each heroine. Similar to Kanon, each heroines' arc describe something unique relating the heroine to the main male protagonist. The transition from arc to arc are often very smooth and does not leave the viewers with any confusion.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality is slightly better than previous Key adapations by Kyoto Animation. For those who are not familiar with the producer, Kyoto Animation (products include  \t\\n\r\nKanon (2006), Air, Full Metal Panic series, Lucky Star, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Kiddy Grade, etc.) has a pretty good reputation for its high level animation. Simply put, one will be find nothing but beautifully drawn girls, dynamic backgrounds, and completely fluid movements in this touching anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP, Megumeru ~cuckool mix 2007~, is sang by Riya of the Eufonius band. To those who have played the visual novel, it should be familiar as the song is actually a remix of the original game OP. While the ED, Dango Daikazoku, is sung by Chata. \\n\\n\r\nAs with many major titles, Clannad also come with a great deal of seiyu talents. Some of these big names include: Mai Nakahara as CV of Nagisa Furukawa, the main female heroine. Mai is famous for her role as Mai, the female lead in Mai HiME, and Norah in Spice and Wolf. Mamiko Noto as CV for Kotomi Ichinose. Mamiko is famous for voicing as Hecate in Shakugan no Shana, Kouta in Kanokon, and Yuka in Elfen Lied. Houko Kuwashima as CV for Tomoyo Sakagami. Some of the more well known roles by Houko includes Clare in Claymore, Flay, Natarle, and Stella in Mobile Suit Gundam Seed / Destiny (yes THREE major roles, yet one can hardly tell they are voiced by the same person), and Quon in RahXephon. Yuichi Nakamura as CV for Tomoya Okazaki, the main male lead of the anime. His past roles include Alto in Macross Frontier, and Graham in Gundam 00.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are highly likable with a large variety of \"flavours\" to choose from. There is the tsundere type, strong-willed type, gentle type, bookworm type ... basically you name it, they have it! Since only 2 of the girls' arc are really covered in detail in Clannad, one might get the feeling that certain girls seem more \"developed\" than others. It should also be noted that there are quite a few unresolved character relations at the end which might make certain viewers feel unsatisfied with the ending. But please keep in mind that this is only half the story, thus one should expect plenty more character developments in the latter half along with more complete, resolved relations.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, Clannad was more enjoyable than Kanon (2006) largely due to the more obvious humours (ones where you will laugh when you see/hear it, rather than those that require thinking and laugh in the aftermath). Tomoya's encounter with the girls are also MUCH more natural (and believable) than Yuuichi's ... in Yuuichi's case, it is almost always \"oo.. must be a girl he left behind in his childhood\" and yet most girls remember him and he only forgets them all.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, that is not to say there is nothing to complain about regarding Clannad. What really nags me is the occasional intrusion by Fuko into the scenes in later episodes. It really disturbs me and I find it absolutely unnecessary. Was it like that in the game too?\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I want to point out that there is an episode 24 (DVD only) named Clannad: Another World, Tomoyo Chapter where the focus is on Tomoya and Tomoyo (what a nice pair of names). Evidently as the name implies, it takes place in \"another world\" thus it does not directly relate to the TV series of Clannad nor Clannad ~After Story~. But Tomoya x Tomoyo supporters would not want to miss this rare opportunity to see them embracing each other!",

An outcast, troubled boy tries to help a sickly, shy girl in forming a drama club. Why does he help her? Why does she want to do it? All sorts of great questions are asked, and the beauty of it is that some are not answered. Things just happen in life, don't they? Sometimes there's never an explanation. The story follows day-t-day school activity and home life. If you're into slice of life with romantic appeal, then you'dlike the story for CLANNAD. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was colourful and pretty, though it may be too moe for some people. There was some good use of bright colours, and it doesn't ever look dull or tired. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was AMAZING. It created a wonderful mood and the ED makes me want to get teary. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters were all unique and awesome. They were bittersweet and touching, each and every one of them. And I must say, Nagisa and Tomoya make some excellent leads, and Sunohara wins hands-down as best supporting character ever.\\n\\n\r\nI loved CLANNAD. It was beautiful. There were one or two unfabulous things, like when it got traditionally harem-like (boobs pressing against guy's back, a ton of girls who want him, misconstrued sexual situations) but the brilliance of it otherwise overshadowed that. \\n\\n\r\nIt is moving, emotional, and lovely.",

            "content": "Clannad, Kyoto Animation's latest anime release, exhibits the meticulous and revered production quality of all the studio's previous releases.  Based on a visual novel by Key, Clannad takes the viewer into a seemingly simple story of life at school, but the series soon develops mysteries and tales of wonder.\r\nEach girl in Clannad (main and supporting cast) has her own personality quirk, one of which is bound to attract a fan.  That kind of variety works to attract many viewers.  But Clannad is not necessarily a \"harem\" by its general definition.  While Tomoya's daily life is indeed surrounded by beautiful girls, heis not interested in dating any of them.  Instead, he becomes involved (accidentally or not) in their hopes and concerns, and the storytelling of the series becomes apparent through the dramatic character development.\\n\\n\r\nIn most episodes, the flow of the story involves each girl a little bit at a time, which I prefer since the drama feels more realistic.  Character development occurs in parallel, and more drama can be drawn from the intertwining relationships among the characters.  Some episodes do define their focus on a particular girl, but the overall immersive feel of the series is not lost.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that Kyoto Animation produces this series has been a recent guarantee that the artwork is superb.  Characters and backgrounds are brilliantly drawn.  Motion of all kinds are captured smoothly -- not only characters walking but also the wind blowing on their clothes.  Body language is also visible, which speaks louder than words most times.\\n\\n\r\nAll the music is taken from the original game, which many fans praise, although it does not allow for too much creativity.  Regardless, the original music is full of variety and is easy on the ears.  Plus it was composed to fit the story for a reason; why not reuse it?  The ED thing (at least the lyrics) is new, though, I believe.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the storytelling is excellent, most of the enjoyment lies in the humor, which is mostly cute and/or slapstick stuff.  Only in rare occasions does the humor detract from the story and drama, but it is mostly timed well and presented as a fun change of pace after a very emotional sequence (or before the next one).  Speaking of emotional sequences, I found myself crying on more than one occasion.  Clannad pulls at the heartstrings very effectively when the time is right.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the defining points of Clannad are the supernatural elements (gotta break the laws of physics a tiny bit to tell a unique story), the moe factor (cute girls are cute, but not totally unrealistic), and the emotionally gripping story (everyone is connected to the overall theme of the series -- family).\\n\\n\r\nI regret that the series is about to end, but I have loved it every step of the way.  Kyoto Animation has such amazing respect right now that I'll give all of its future Key adaptations a 10/10, before having seen any of the episodes or knowing anything about the series.  They know how not to disappoint.\\n\\n\r\n(Originally written 11/22/07 after episode 7.  Last updated 02/09/08 after episode 17.)",

            "content": "Clannad is the 3rd in the line of Harem, Romance anime based of Key&rsquo;s Visual Novel (dating sim) and with the bar set pretty high, this anime is able to reach the expectations of its fans.\r\nVideo Alternative\r\nThe series begins as a usual high school anime, with no defined plot or storyline but just introduces the male protagonist and the girls that the series revolves around. From the first couple of episodes it is easy to pin point the obvious similarities it has with its predecessor (Kanon) but the major difference is the level of comedy. The comedy of Clannad is on a completely different level,as it manages to turn anything to do with games (RPGs) or romance anime into a hilarious joke. However during the girl's various stories the comedy is somewhat replaced with some heartfelt drama, which adds depth to the series but it lacks a bit of substance. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter much though, as this once again proves to be a winning combination.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are an important aspect of this &ldquo;winning combination&rdquo;, as you will grow to care about some of the characters so much that you may even shed a tear. The girls are the major part of the story and even though their personalities are a little clich&eacute;d, they each get their own moment to shine. However the length of the series did negatively affect the girls during the 2nd half of the series. The male protagonist (Tomoya) is surprisingly well developed, as he intermingles between the girls various stories and of course, brings most of the comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the animation is nothing short of wonderful, with beautifully drawn girls, dynamic backgrounds completely fluid movements that would put many shows to shame. I&rsquo;ve probably said this same thing to a lot of other anime series but if you know anything about &ldquo;Kyoto Animation&rdquo; then you&rsquo;ll know the sort of standard you are going to get, from watching this masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the music in a lot of other KyoAni shows, the music plays an important role in Clannad and I&rsquo;m not only talking about the catchy OP and ED theme (dango). Each of the main characters gets their own theme tunes that go well with their personalities, adding a sort of personal touch to the main girls. Nonetheless it does get a bit repetitive, listening to the same tunes over and over.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Clannad has proven to be one of the best Harem, Romance anime of our time. It is really hard to find a flaw in this amazing series, because it has superb visuals, a great story and some of the best characters. Even with a lot of parallels with its predecessors, Clannad still manages to break free and become a show of its own. Of course it is riddled with clich&eacute;s and cheesy moments but you wouldn&rsquo;t mind, due to the many hilarious and touching moments.\\n\\n\r\nYou don&rsquo;t need to be a harem anime fan to enjoy Clannad, you just need a heart.\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "I was randomly looking around for a new anime too watch, but at the time I were watching alot of action animes and never considered to watch any romance/drama animes. I joined a chat on an anime site and asked for a recommendation. Someone mentioned Clannad and alot of people supported the suggestion. In any case: I started too watch Clannad.\r\nArt\r\nThe first thing I noticed about Clannad was the art, it is probably one of the best elements in Clannad. I would often pause the anime for a minute just to watch the surroundings. I concluded that the sunsets were the most beautiful. Why? Becausethe orange glow it emitted was just stunning. Never before had I seen anything similar in an anime. Well, we do got other animes from Kyoto Animation, like Air or Haruhi Suzumyia. But I still found Clannad's art more charming than any other anime. The character art is also brilliant, and can resemble Haruhi Suzumiya, Kanon and even Lucky Star. A huge element which Kyoto Animation used was tears, you could for example often see Sunohara cry out of pleasure, pain or by being fooled by Okazaki. I can't find anything bad about the art in Clannad and therefore:\\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                 Rating: 10\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nAnother good thing about Clannad is the sound. From excellent voice actors like Yuichi Nakamura, Mai Nakahara, Ry\u014d Hirohashi and Daisuke Sakaguchi too amazing situational music. Clannad soundtrack covers everything in a perfect manner: from spirited and happy moments too melancholy and sad moments. Jun Maeda, Magome Togoshi, and Shinji Orito who are the geniuses behind the music also made soundtracks for Air.\\n\r\nThere are also soundtracks which fits each character. For example you have Sunohara which have uplifting and spirited music which fits too his personality. Nor in the sound can i find any flaws, and therefore:\\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                 Rating: 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nOne thing i simply loved about Clannad were the characters. How they were presented, their development and everything else about them. Each character had their past and views about things throughly explained throughout the anime, which was a first for me. And while watching Clannad, i felt like i were bonding with each character. Which made After Story a heart breaker, but lets save that for later. \\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                 Rating: 10\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nClannad's story is separated into several arcs. You have the very beginning of the anime were the main characters and some secondary characters are presented and also some relationships start to spin off. Then you have the  Fuko Ibuki arc, the Kotomi Ichinose arc and after that Clannad keeps building the relationship between the characters. You often get a harem feel in Clannad, although it is not presented on a \"ecchi\" basis which we often witness in comedy/romance animes. Well, you have Sunohara of course, but the protagonist, Okazaki, isn't really the ecchi type. Of course, there are a few moments, but it is not the main basis of Clannad's humor. Which I think affected the story in an excellent way.\\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                 Rating: 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nClannad's humor is just flawless. It's not too ecchi and you never seem to get tired of Sunoharas stupidity or Okazakis pranks. You also have Kyou's anger and Tomoyo's grown up personality and her desire to be a student council president. These are of course just examples. But there are also sad parts in Clannad which I think were done really well. And it were all supported by excellent music.\\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                  Rating: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say? I loved everything about Clannad, and it is by far my favorite anime. I can recommend this anime to everyone, it is really worth taking a look at. Even if you don't like romance/drama/humor as much!\\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                  Rating: 10",

            "content": "Please, why is it noone sees that this anime is a disgrace to anime? Look at it, look at it! Of course, I realize that saying that is wrong since, in truth, there are worse animes than Clannad, infact there are quite a few that are worse, but they are accordingly and consequently rated much lower than Clannad. \r\nOk, let's disregard everything and just take a look at the characters? I mean what are they? They have no personality whatsoever, they borderline characters that are in really, really bad harem animes and there are some really bad ones out there. Basically the only good haremI've ever watched that outright called itself a harem is Kimi ga Nozomu Eien.\\n\\n\r\nBut this is not about Kimi ga Nozomu Eien, it's about Clannad. An anime which has produced a sequel. Both the first one and its sequel have recieved much praise from many people. I don't see it at all and I must go back to my main points of criticism which are characters, character development and character interaction. Basically everything that had to do with characters in this anime downright sucked. The story isn't good either but atleast it had a few redeeming points, the characters did not. And what's more; there was no comic relief character, there was no funny guy, the funny guy was a complete drag and a pushover.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to stop, you thought I was going to stop didn't you? I'm not going to stop. It is just too fake. Anime is perhaps not always supposed to depict real life events, occurances and scenarios, but come on, the interaction between the characters was just too fake. It felt like they weren't even in the same scene as eachother. Now I'm going to talk a little about the main character; he has no personality. I said that earlier didn't I? Well I can afford saying it again. Why is he even bothering showing up on screen? What is he saying? Does anyone care what he's saying? You know who's worse? Nagisa, the female main lead. She's like a dog, or a cat, or any other fluffy cute animal. The only difference is that Nagisa can speak, but just like cats and dogs she doesn't really have to speak because whenever she does say something it's completely meaningless and without any worth.\\n\\n\r\nOn the bright side, it had some decent art and animations, which is something that can only be expected from KyoAni. Yea that's about the only good thing I have to say about this anime, well apart from the fact that it's ranked much higher than many animes that are much better than this, an abomination in itself. But it's still a redeeming point that the anime possess I suppose.",

            "content": "Clannad revolves around a high schooler, Tomoya, who after befriending a young girl named Nagisa, makes new friends. Tomoya quickly discovers that there's more to these young girls than meets the eye and tries to help them with their problems while dealing with his own.\r\nStory: What more is there to say about the story other than it's great? The word clannad means family. There are five girls, each with their own story to tell that somehow involves family. Although there are many comparsions to Kanon, they remain different because Kanon's overall story was about miracles, while Clannad is about the bond of family.\r\nArt: As expectedof Kyoto Animation, the animation quality is superb. I don't think there's a single negative comment I can make about it. The character designs are great. The way the characters look and act line up perfectly with each other. The background isn't lacking of detail either.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening and ending songs fit well with the story. The opening shows the dramatic side and the ending shows the light-hearted side. Nagisa's voice is portayed very well. Her insecurities an naviety are very evident. Tomoya's funny antics shine brightly through his voice. The music played during comedic scenes and the music played for emotional scenes fit perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Each character is very unique and different from each other. There's the strong-willed loud mouths and the insecure shy types and not to mention the two delinquents that provide the much needed comedic relief. They all have separate yet equally srong stories to tell.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I definitely enjoyed this series. It has every aspect an interesting story needs: drama, comedy, and romance. The comedy scenes sit well with the series because they keep the story from being too emotional. The romance is also nice. Nagisa and Tomoya have such a cute relationship. It's interesting to watch their two different characters interact.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think this is a series that should not be missed. Regardless of what intrigues you, you're sure to find something you enjoy about this series.",

            "content": "I rarely go for so-called \"slice of life\" stories, but I heard a lot about this anime. I heard it was amazing. Maybe I'm just a weirdo, but by the end of it, my thoughts were quite the opposite. \r\nI'll describe the given categories in order of importance, from least to greatest.\r\nLets start with the -sound- \r\nI enjoyed the opening theme, \"Megumeru\", and ended up adding it to my playlist. The music overall is good. That's all I have to say about that.\r\n-8/10-\r\nNow for the -art-...\r\nUnfortunately, I found it very annoying. When Tomoyo first met Nagisa on the street and she opened up those horrificallyhuge eyes, I literally facedesked. What the hell is this? This pseudo-chibi, or moe style or whatever it is... it's not cute. It's not \"kawaiidesu.\" It's extremely... I don't know how exactly to describe it. Let's just say that at first, the sight of them made me want to break things. By the end, I was desensitized, of course... but the point is: They look like extraterrestrials.\\n\r\n-5/10- \\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for the -characters-... \\n\r\nThis is the main reason I was turned off by this anime. I hated most of them, and I was quite disgruntled by their behavior. I will describe the mains in order from the ones I dislike the least to the most:\\n\\n\r\n-Tomoyo- \\n\r\nThis is the one girl from this silly harem that I actually like. She is ambitious, and she knows exactly what she wants, unlike many women. Not only does she know how to fight, in every sense of the word, but she knows how to cook for and take care of her man - the complete package in a woman. -8/10-\\n\r\nI also like her little brother. \"Hey mom, dad, I want to see the sakuras together every year!\" \"Oh honey I dont' know...\" *takes out razor blade* \"Oh there's some peach fuzz on my wrists. I'll shave it off a little\" \"OH WAIT DON'T DO THAT HONEY! OKAY WE'LL DO IT!\" I was certainly intrigued by his persuasion techniques.\\n\\n\r\n-Youhei-\\n\r\nYouhei seems to be a comic relief character. I don't like those. But then again, he always seems to get thrashed verbally and physically by everyone. So I suppose I feel some sympathy for him. There was nothing special about him, but I couldn't find anything serious to dislike about him either - a fairly decent character overall. -6/10-\\n\\n\r\n-Kyou-\\n\r\nI don't like her simply because she's a jerk. She really doesn't do that much in the story other than being a loud obnoxious little jerk. And it's annoying. I don't have much else to say about her. -5/10-\\n\\n\r\n-Kotomi-\\n\r\nApparently she's a genius. But when we first met her, I got the impression that she was a retard. She does pitiful things like crying in a corner while her friends break their backs for her. I cannot appreciate that. -5/10-\\n\\n\r\n-Fuuko-\\n\r\nAnother ridiculous sob story. Probably the most ridiculous of all of them. Her obsession with wooden shuriken did not amuse me, nor did her cameo appearances. - 4/10-\\n\\n\r\n-Tomoya-\\n\r\nAh... the main character... His right arm can't shoot basketballs anymore, so instead of learning to use his left arm like any rational person, he becomes a \"delinquent.\" And so he discovers poor little Nagisa-chan and randomly decides to dedicate his life to helping her realize her dream, because his own life no longer has any meaning. He also wants to help every stray girl he comes across, instead of focusing on his studies. I'm sorry but I can't admire or respect a person like that, because if you don't have any ambition and can only worry about others, what's going to happen to you? It's not like you're gonna get a huge prize at the end. You will still have to hope for the charity of others yourself... for the rest of your life. I cannot support such a lifestyle. And the part that irritates me the most is the situation with his father. The guy is apparently a bum and needs help. If Tomoya should be helping anyone, he should be helping him. The name of of this story, \"Clannad,\" implies that this is supposed to be about \"family\" right?  Well, there is no real reason Tomoya can't forgive his father for the greater good, for the sake of family. Yet somehow Tomoya would struggle to help random girls off the street over his own father. Regardless of what happened between them, I cannot respect that. All of this is only half the reason I hate this guy, but I can't say the rest without writing spoilers. So there you have it. -3/10-\\n\\n\r\n-Nagisa-\\n\r\nAnd now the character I hate the most - the type of female I hate the most. She is the kind who is completely helpless on her own. She can't do anything for herself, and if Tomoya hadn't taken her in like a stray animal she would have sat alone in a corner eating bread for the rest of her life. She is the type of girl who has no self-esteem and at one point is even sorry for being born. She has great trouble calling Tomoya by his first name even after all they've been through, due to her obscene lack of self-confidence. By the way, when I go to Japan one day, I'm just gonna call all of them by their first name with no honorifics, just for teh lulz. Anyway, she relies solely on the help and sacrifice of others, and she wants to waste it by sulking and crying in a corner. Quite frankly, it's pathetic.  I don't accept that she's \"physically weak\" as an excuse. I've seen autistic paraplegics with more independence and fiber of character.  -2/10-\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for the -story-\\n\r\nAll in all, it's all about Tomoya's life's mission to help stray girls, and how they all want him. I'll admit I was amused in some parts, and maybe a little sympathetic in others, but not enough to make up for everything else that bothered me. That's all I have to say about that. \\n\r\n-4/10- \\n\\n\r\nAnd my -enjoyment-\\n\r\nI will simply repeat the word \"decent.\" To be quite honest, the only reason I kept watching this show after the atrocious Fuuko arc was the same reason some people would vote for say... Sarah Palin: \"morbid curiosity.\"\\n\r\n-4/10-\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I don't know if my curiosity is enough for me to continue with the \"After Story\" ...maybe if I'm extremely bored one day. Well, whatever. Thanks for reading.",

            "content": "From what I've heard from many of my friends and reviews, generally Clannad is a heartwarming tearjerker with the very adorable characters. But based on viewing it, I say that people who do not prefer \"moe\" like me will have a different opinion.\r\nWhat is \"moe?\"It is a terminology that takes on many forms in anime;  I have no right to define it but for me the closest meaning to it is \"cuteness\"\r\nStory (7/10)\r\nClannad's story is a slice of school life where the main characters encounter different people and situations alike. Each has their own conflict as a student, as a family member or asan individual. In my opinion, the story is simple.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I find its arcs or stories not surprisingly new. Problems about self confidence, crushes and parental relationships are already common though the way the protagonists address those problems are certainly interesting to see. Some things will make you smile,some has surprising twists and some may break your heart.  But in another prospective, Clannad may be truly intended to those that relate to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is slow; it does not jump right into the situation but rather introduces its featured characters and shows their personalities and comical sides; though some may find those tidbits insignificant. And also, I find each arc unique on its own. Though slow, development is gradual and very in-character.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem is that many things are predictable or expected, or that some viewers might get irked with all the unnecessary crying. \\n\\n\r\nBut Clannad has some little elements as well that I can say...out of this world. It's interpretation differs from one to another and is a good connection to the individuality and emotions of a person.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt is also very familiar to the eyes for many animes featured Clannad's style but it is certainly refreshing. The environment and its colors are pleasing to the eyes with their mild tones. Probably the greatest asset of its animation is the characters. Different\"unique\" hair colors and styles has successfully distinguished one character from the other...and the eyes are gorgeous!\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nDango Dango Dango Dango Dango Dango Daikazoku...\\n\\n\r\nThe memorable thing about Clannad's music are its melodies and the ending song certainly makes it so. So my praise comes to \"Dango Daikazoku\" because it fits the series in a very cute and adorable; but the song somehow touches a different area and tells another meaning.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is appropriate though not entirely exceptional. And though I say Clannad's melodies are good, the background music every episode are almost the same, making it repetitive and predictable. They could have used different character themes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nLoving the series lies within loving its characters; and generally, all the protagonists are classic school characters:\\n\\n\r\na delinquent, yet helpful boy\\n\r\na boy who's the punching bag of female characters\\n\r\na girl with little self-confidence\\n\r\na cute yet mysterious girl\\n\r\na pair of contrasting sisters\\n\r\na shy and intelligent girl\\n\r\na tough and responsible girl\\n\\n\r\nThough many don't find them new (they're classic!), they somehow shine with some unique characteristics and actions that leaves a smile at one's face. Their interaction greatly plays a role in the drama of the genre. Many of them has hidden pasts and secrets that are revealed differently along the way. However, they are arguably generic and lacks development. Cuteness for the sake of it being cute may irk some viewers.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the central plot mover, Nagisa Furukawa is weak. The story is made predictable through her and what is accomplished in the whole series can be compressed in a few episodes or such. Everybody acts in an idealized fashion around her while her struggle simply lacks impact and nothing new.\\n\\n\r\nNotably, every one of them is kind-hearted. And they settle everything through teamwork and will-power. Don't expect intense humanism nor psychology. Expec\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is rather personal and its not the best basis in rating the series. However, I was not entertained by the countless \"I'm sorry!\" then  \"It's okay!\" dialogues and the lack of faults in the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an anime with dark themes, societal issues, intense drama, cool action and superb coolness Clannad is not for you. But if you want a relaxing anime with adorable characters that will make you reflect about your school life and the feelings of people then check this series out.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6\\n",

It was so silly, uninteresting, and so stereotyped that once I even have  fallen asleep. Honestly, I was just so bored with the storyline and so annoyed with some of the main characters that I just wanted to drop it sometimes.\r\nOk, then lets start with the story:\r\nThe cute looking boy meets just awfully ugly girl with the strange things in her head. Then she starts saying some senseless things. In the school he seesthat she's very lonely and he feels pity for her so they become friends. In this moments she can say that he's her first and most precious friend. Ok. Then she starts fall for him and he for her, but they are too shy and there's many other girls around him so she can't say that she likes him. Then it's showing that none of them can't suit him more than the main girl and in the end they confess to each other and end up dating. Such a silly, stereotyped drama and harem. I give the story 4/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOmg, I HATED the main girl Furukawa, Nagisa. You just can't imagine how annoying she was. Like an eyesore. \\n\r\nOther girls was ok. Especially Kyou. She was very cute and cool. \\n\r\nTomoya is the best. I very liked his personality and you know he was the one of the reasons why I watched the anime untill the end. [fangirl] He looks so cute",

            "content": "Tomoya Okazaki is a Highschool student who lives with his farther. Their relationship has progressed to the point where they're both strangers to one another. One morning on his way to school he meets a girl Nagisa Furukawa. The two befriend one another and over time the two help each other along the way in various tasks as their relationship continues to grow. \r\nIt\u2019s finally time to review this show after months of debating. \r\nStory:\r\nThe story follows our main protagonist Tomoya Okazaki, a delinquent who is frequently late to school, has bad grades and consistently gets into fights with others. It just so happened tobe a spot of luck that he meets the main heroine who would help change his life, Nagisa Furukawa. This shy and reserved girl happened to be speaking to herself whilst on her way in to school was surprised to see Tomoya standing by offering words of comfort. \\n\\n\r\nThat was the pinnacle moment that set the relationship between the two in motion as well as the rest of the series. From there on Tomoya and Nagisa help each other and help other friends along the way which helps to further strengthen the bond between Nagisa and Tomoya. \\n\\n\r\nStory arcs for characters like the Ibuki sisters, Nagisa and the drama club, Kotomi and her past and helping Tomoyo to become school president all contribute towards helping Tomoya become a better and happier person. I would get into more detail about each of the story arcs but that could create spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nTomoya at first is portrayed as a distant guy who seems out of touch with people. It\u2019s only after being with Nagisa that we see the stark contrast as to what he is like before. His interactions with all of the characters are very interesting as you can see how he treats each individual and how he regards the people closest to him. For example his relationship with Youhei Sunohara is very relaxed and Tomoya often tends to tease him, however the two have a strong relationship which is later addressed in the second season. When you compare the relationship with Youhei to his relationship with Ryou Fujibayashi, it just appears to be very uncomfortable and often forced at times. It is very heart warming to see how Tomoya grows as a character and the selflessness of his acts always turns out to be worth the effort. \\n\\n\r\nNagisa Furukawa is a shy and introverted girl. Now since I\u2019m a big fan of the show i always here people saying what a dull and boring character she is, but i disagree with that. Nagisa is a very kind and caring girl. She doesn't often get angry and when she does its just adorable. Her determination is very admirable. She is always empathetic of others and is a very selfless person. Nagisa is the sense of normality that Tomoya has been searching for and you can see his life approaching normal from the time they spend together.\\n\\n\r\nThe last mentionable character for me is Youhei Sunohara. Essentially the comic relief character Youhei is a constant presence of laughs for the show. He is similar to Tomoya because of their situations and that\u2019s how the two became friends. He is a punching bag for a couple of the female characters in the show and he just can't seem to catch a break with woman. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI'd have to say that the art was the weak point of the show. The background wasn't done that well and you can notice this when looking at buildings various street items. The animation was exceptional, i couldn't find much to fault with it, but it wasn't by any means extravagant. The designs of the characters... well its Key animation so expect Moe looking characters with big eyes and who all have the same face essentially. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI enjoyed the soundtrack for this show and the softer tones frequently used in the opening scenes were very calming and nice. The opening for the show was very well done, but from time to time i skipped it. The ending sequence was a lullaby song called 'Dango Daikazuku, which was very peaceful and a highlight for the series for me. It was something i couldn't skip once. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nTo say I enjoyed this series would be very undermining. This show demonstrated to me the power of friendship, the bonds between people and how a lucky meeting with someone can change your life. This show brought out so many emotions in me which I didn\u2019t think it was possible to have. I felt what the characters felt and while I\u2019m always hoping for the show to give Youhei I break, I just fell in love with this. This isn\u2019t by any means a perfect show, everything has its flaws, but perfection is only what you make of it and to me this show is perfect. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI give this show a well deserved 9/10 and a place in my heart forever. This show isn\u2019t for everyone. Those who have seen shows like Air or Kanon 2006 may not regard this as a big deal. If you are not a fan of romance anime this also won\u2019t be for you. I recommend this show to those looking for a sweet and heart warming romance anime with excellent character relationships. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading guys; I had a few tears well up in my eyes whilst writing this.I plan to review the second season soon. See you later and have a nice day! \\n\\n",

            "content": "Ok, so this is my first anime review. After hearing many people rave about this so-called \"great\" anime, I thought that I would give my input on what I personally thought of this show.\nThis anime is supposed to be really emotional and tear-jerking, but the only tears that I experienced were tears of boredom! I had to sit and suffer through the whole series at an anime club meeting because I really had no where else to go. I was trying hard to get into the series, but I just couldn't, and here's why:\nStory: Story? What story?! There's no real story here! Just some dudehelping a bunch of girls with their emotional problems! You call that a story?! Although I suppose the question posed is which girl he will end up with in the end (By the way, I already know who he ends up with in the Afterstory just from reading the synopsis, but I won't spoil anything and I don't intend to watch Afterstory). It sounds like the synopsis to, oh, I dunno...pretty much every other harem out there! By the way, I hate harem with a burning passion and I'm sorry,  but this anime is really no acception. The only difference is that this is harem makes a desperate attempt to try to be \"meaningful\" but fails horribly (I will explain why later).\\n\\n\nArt: The colors are pleasing on the eyes and the scenery is well-lighted. Unfortunately, neither of those things can make up for the utterly generic designs of the characters. Every character basically looks the bloody same! The only real differences would be the hair and eye color! What's especially disturbing is how sickingly cutesy and moe everyone looks. There's no variety! I mean, C'MON, you need ugly characters to balance out the cute and pretty ones (at least that's how I see it).\\n\\n\nSound: Nothing too memorable here either. I only found the \"Dango\" ending mildly amuzing, but's that's about it. \\n\\n\nCharacter: They say you can have best and most original storyline in the world, but without good characters to move the story along, you've got NOTHING. And this especially rings true with me. See, this is the major problem I have with the series: the CAST! Most of them failed to impress me and draw my interest. For one, the main character Tomoya has no personality whatsoever! He's nothing more than a vessel for his female classmates to dump all of their emotional baggage onto. And the other characters are pretty much card-board cutouts of character archetypes from other harem shows like Air and Kanon. There's really nothing special about them. Most of them are dull and flat. The only somewhat interesting one was Tomoyo, after I've seen her beat up that gang of boys. I thought that was pretty badass and was pretty much the highlight of the show for me. \\n\\n\nEnjoyment: As I was saying earlier, this show was obviously created to be an emotional tear-jerker and, therefore, \"meaningful\". I, however, wasn't moved one bit. The characters emotions just seemed so fake and artificial that it was really hard for me to care about them, especially since most of the characters don't appeal to me in the first place. The creators' attempt at trying to create pathos just failed for me. I found this show to be pretentious, contrived, and boring. Sure, there were a few comedic moments, but they were too few in number and couldn't compensate for all the sappy, corny melodrama of sob backstories in this show. If the show had a better cast, more comedy, and real raw emotions instead of the characters just simply sitting perfectly still telling their stories, I probably would have enjoyed the series a lot more. \\n\\n\nOverall: If you're a drama fanatic and you like moe and emo characters, then this is the show for you! As for me, I wish I'd have gotten all those hours of my time back because I thought it was pointless, sacarine, moe fluff and I really don't get all the hype behind it! As I see it, it's really no different than anything else out there.",

            "content": "I can already tell people are expecting a very trollish review but to me, this is my most unenjoyed and possibly most hated anime of all time. Lets just get into the review though shall we? Also this is for clannad not after story. after story was okay but I am treating it as its own thing.\r\nStory 2\\10\r\nI mean it was your normal slice of life anime but even for that the story was pretty bad. It never had a main girl besides attending school and for a slice of life, it made absolutely no sense since some paranormal stuff were happening like ghost girlin the first arc. Not the worst story but it was basically go to school and lets try to tug on your hear strings while being funny which ultimately felt more like watamote to me than comic relief. Worst part of all is that everything was predictable for me right down to the smallest detail not because I am good at that it just felt like where else would they go with that. There are other problems but that would contain spoilers so I will cap it right here.\\n\\n\r\nArt 2\\10\\n\r\nNow its fine if you thought the art was good, but I have seen clannad fans acting like the art was perfect and from what I have heard \"should be put in a museum\". Now comparing this to other animes made from kyoko animation, it is definitely the worst product I have seen from them animation wise. I have no idea why eyes were too big but that is just one thing. My biggest problem was that it all felt choppy. For the year 2007, if felt like so many other animes either brought something new to the table when it came to animation or were simply better so for the year 2007 it just fell short. \\n\\n\r\nSound 2\\10\\n\r\nNow I do my research most of the time, but for this one thing I am about to say I did not. What I really disliked was the fact that they had one track play for about 25% of the time and it got really annoying to me. It was just unmemorable to me in general but at the end of the day its just music preferences. If you thought the music was better I understand why.\\n\r\nCharacters 1\\10\\n\r\nFinally I get to be salty. The majority of characters were flat out trash\\generic and I will go over all of them individually. Going to go in no particular order though\\n\\n\r\nFuko Ibuki 1\\10\\n\r\nevery time she came up I just wanted to cringe. Throughout all episodes even after her arc she would appear for short periods of time with the same wooden starfish joke and it was just unfunny to eventually being cringey or I would flat want to skip it.Nothing really to that character besides a cheap trick to pull on your heart strings \\n\r\nNagisa 5\\10\\n\r\nNothing really wrong with her besides being the generic shy girl\\sickly one. She had her good moments nothing really to say besides I wish every other character was more like her so I can give a better score\\n\r\nFujibayasha twins\\n\r\nThe two purple hair girls in short, one was generic shy one and the other one was basically your hey look I can beat up our mc a few times I am a generic tsundere Just generic dating sim girls but worse which makes sense since this was a VN before an anime.\\n\r\nSunoharah\\n\r\nBasically your generic best friend comic relief who is a huge pervert and all girls hate him just the same old jokes for every upisode got very annoying.\\n\r\nKotomi 4\\10\\n\r\nHer arc was the least painful thing to sit on and after that they toss her away. she was the quiet library girl typical generic shit you would think with a sad backstory. Not a bad character but nothing really special besides one thing I really liked. She was the only girl not thirsty for our MC 100 percent of the time. I liked how she needed to be worked for and even than she likes him like every other girl but she is not slobbering all over him.\\n\r\nTomoya\\n\r\n1\\10\\n\r\nI can say I enjoyed this character the second least. Generic hey I can beat up everyone in the school and 1v50 rival gangs but inside I feel insecure. Just horrible character throughout everything.\\n\r\nTomoya 1\\10\\n\r\nOur main MC oh yea in a nutshell generic MC of any harem like anime with the hey look I am depressed. Nothing stands out with him and his backstory is nothing really but does explain how he became a delinquent. \\n\r\nOverall I just could not like most of the cast they all did not ever feel important to me.\\n\\n\r\nFinal judgment 1\\10\\n\r\nFirst off even if you put this review as not helpful or hate em general since clannad fans a bit unrational at times. I like animes like this I usaully give most slice of lifes a 4-7 rating or if it has lots of emotion like anohana, or your lie in april, I give them very high scores 8-10. Point of all that was showing that its not because I dislike animes like this its just this particular anime I will never get why its popular. I believe just a theory here but it was good for its time and characters like that fit the bill for that time. I see most people who watch clannad now of days really hate it or simply could not get through it which I had the same problem but eventually did. Mostt fans are people who grew up with clannad so maybe its a generation thing and for some reason even though I watched it maybe 09 or something I just simply hated it. \\n",

            "content": "Visual novel adaptations are something that I'm not particularly fond of, especially slice-of-life romance visual novel adaptations. Why? Well... more often than not, a harem ends up inadvertently forming due to the fact that the adaptation in question is trying to cover so many stories at once to the point where it sends off some rather bizarre messages and implications. You want a good example of what I'm talking about? Let's take a look at Clannad: one of the most popular visual novel adaptations of recent years and one that has left me with some SERIOUSLY mixed feelings.\r\nBefore I go any further, I just wantto take the time to explain the nuances of visual novels to those of you who aren't familiar. If you're a VN addict, you can just skip this paragraph. Basically, visual novels make you play through the story and based on the choices you make, you go down a specific \"route.\" If you go down one \"route,\" you cannot go down the others unless you start from square one again. This is especially the case with slice-of-life romance visual novels like Clannad, where you're introduced to multiple girls but you can only pick one girl at the end of it all. \\n\\n\r\nSlice-of-life romance visual novel adaptations end up trying to cover all of the girls' stories throughout the course of the show. Key word: trying. The biggest problem that visual novel adaptations have is the fact that anime as a medium does NOT have an answer to certain visual novel nuances. Because visual novels work in such a way where you're supposed to play through the story and you end up going down routes, it's only natural for characters and such to be thrown to the wayside since it's expected for you to play through the other routes if you want the full story. This nuance does NOT translate over to an anime context at all, and it's the biggest reason as to why I can't get on with Clannad.\\n\\n\r\nClannad focuses on Tomoya Okazaki who is a delinquent high school student who hates the town he lives in. Over the course of the story, he happens across the various girls that he attends school with and ends up helping them through various issues and problems that they face. All things considered, the set-up we have here is average but it's still a workable premise. However, Clannad's visual novel roots REALLY affect the story in quite a few negative ways. For starters: Tomoya meets a girl named Nagisa in the beginning of the story and their interactions in the beginning of the first episode make it obvious that these two will have a thing going on.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem with that is the fact that Nagisa gets shafted to the side so that KyoAni can adapt the other girls' stories from the visual novel. Why is this an issue? Well... it shouldn't come off as a surprise that all of the girls in the visual novel will inevitably have some romantic involvement with the player character, so whenever KyoAni is adapting one girl's story, all the other girls get thrown to the wayside JUST to adapt that specific girl's story. More often than not, Nagisa ends up getting relegated to a side character role for half the series. Keep in mind: she's supposed to be Tomoya's main love interest... at least, that's what's implied.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not even like the events that transpired previously are even kept in memory throughout the show. I wouldn't mind it so much if that was the case. Tomoya literally moves from girl to girl without so much as a second thought and seemingly without remembering what just transpired previously. So right off the bat, I'm not particularly fond of him. What's more is that it's never explicitly mentioned whether or not what just went down was purely platonic or not. I wouldn't mind it so much if I at least knew that Tomoya had no romantic interest with the girl he was currently helping or whatever. But no, there's always gotta be some damn romantic subtext going on in each girl's arc... despite the fact that it's so painfully obvious that Nagisa is the one who Tomoya really likes.\\n\\n\r\nTaking a break from inadvertent harems caused by visual novel roots, there are quite a few other problems that Clannad has on the whole. The comedic relief in Clannad is akin to what you'd find in Kanon mixed with a small dash of what you'd find in Love Hina. Essentially, we have one character who can't catch a break and is always on the receiving end of physical abuse from various girls (Sunohara), the wise yet obnoxious guy (Akio), the airhead girl with an irritating running gag/quirk (Sanae/Fuko), and so on and so forth. It was charming for the first 5-6 episodes, but it just got REALLY annoying and repetitive after that point. It doesn't help that the comedy keeps popping up to such a large degree to the point where it would interfere with any sort of drama that this show would have.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that drives me up a wall with Clannad is the moe. I know that moe is Kyoto Animation's signature, but I swear... EVERY SINGLE FEMALE CHARACTER IS MOE. Big eyes that take up 50% of their heads and also stare into your soul, tiny noses/mouths, high-pitched voices, certain character quirks and the like are commonplace across the Kyoto/KEY trilogy and it never ceases to leave me with some horrendously mixed feelings. On the one hand: KyoAni was simply translating the character designs from the Clannad visual novels, and seem to have done more than a fair job at it judging by the screenshots I've seen. On the other hand, I can't take any of these girls seriously BECAUSE of the moe. They're cute and endearing, yes but they're cute and endearing like beagle puppies and not actual humans to me. Is that horribly sexist of me to say? Possibly. But then again, I tend to overthink these things so maybe I'm just making a mountain out of a moehill (get the joke?).\\n\\n\r\nI could tolerate this however, were it not for the fact that Clannad semi-regularly brings drama into the picture without any sense of foreshadowing whatsoever. This is most prominent with Kotomi and Nagisa's arcs. Now, Kotomi and Nagisa are relatively silly characters with quirky yet endearing personalities. However, their arcs dive into their back-story and as it turns out, the circumstances of their childhoods aren't all sunshine and rainbows. The only problem is the fact that last episode, we saw them being all moe, jovial and shit. You get where I'm going with this? These moments were specifically designed to be emotionally manipulative in the worst possible ways. I'd be lying through my teeth if I said I didn't feel something, but it wasn't because I found myself truly invested with the characters. It was because these moments were specifically designed to tug at my heart strings in the most shallow and manipulative ways possible.\\n\\n\r\nLet's compare this to a moment from one of my all-time favourite animated films that actually DID leave me tearing up because I was invested with the characters, Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. This movie follows Bruce Wayne's life shortly before he became Batman and how he almost completely abandons his plan of becoming a crime fighter when he meets a woman named Andrea Beaumont and falls in love. At one point in the film, he's torn between his plans of becoming a crime fighter and actually living a happy life to the point where he actually visits his parents' graves and apologises for not going through with the plan because he \"didn't count on being happy.\"\\n\\n\r\nI was actually invested with what Bruce was going through for four reasons: First off, feeling guilty for being happy is incredibly commonplace to people who've gone through a lot of strife in their lives. Second, this is the first time we ever see Bruce expressing any emotion that isn't anger or frustration which he rarely did in Batman TAS. Third, the inflections in Kevin Conroy's voice as he was delivering his lines actually did capture the guilt that Bruce feels. Fourth (and the reason why Kotomi partially escapes my ire): I actually have lost a parent so I know full well how Bruce feels. Say what you will about Batman being some childish superhero, but Bruce Timm, Paul Dini et al did their best to portray Bruce in a realistic manner, which they successfully did.\\n\\n\r\nWas there ANY moment in this season of Clannad where I remotely felt anything similar? The answer is a resounding \"NO.\" Even Kotomi's arc which I can vaguely relate to was done in such a way where she wasn't painted as a real human being. She was portrayed as a moeblob in need of someone to hold her and console her during those moments of drama/tragedy. As someone who actually has lost a parent, I can safely say that Kotomi's portrayal was nothing short of insulting. I don't take umbrage with Kotomi herself since her various quirks and such (i.e. introverted behaviour, lacklustre social skills) are within the realm of probability for someone with her predicament. \\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER, when you take such a character, say she went through a massive tragedy like that, try to resolve all of that shit within the span of 4-5 episodes AND have the audacity to throw such a character to the wayside and not make her a bigger player in the events that happen on screen after that point, THAT'S where I draw the line. Nagisa's arc was SLIGHTLY more tolerable because of how Akio handled everything, but it's still not something I'm quick to endorse because of how Nagisa was characterised (which I'll get to in the next section).\\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters are concerned, there isn't a lot in the way of originality. Like I said before, we're dealing with an SOL romance visual novel adaptation, and the characters end up falling into a great many clich\u00e9s because of said visual novel roots. First up, we have Tomoya Okazaki. If you've watched Haruhi Suzumiya, Kanon 2006, Chu-2, or pretty much anything else produced by Kyoto Animation that has a lead male protagonist, you'll know his general disposition: he's sarcastic, snarky, and has to put up with a bunch of crap from moeblobs. Similarly, we have Sunohara: his best friend who takes it upon himself to act like a complete and total moron in the most ridiculous ways possible.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as Tomoya goes, I don't really care much for him in this season of Clannad. Now, Tomoya on his own is fairly likeable albeit generic but where his characterisation really falters is when he's helping another girl. At first, I didn't really have much of a problem with this because I was ignorant of the fact that Clannad was a visual novel adaptation and I really didn't find out about that until I was half-way through After Story. HOWEVER... the more that I dwell upon Tomoya's behaviour in this season of Clannad, the less I find myself liking him. \\n\\n\r\nKnowing the fact that the girl that Tomoya is interacting with would've inevitably had some romantic involvement in the source material something that really just drives me up a wall. Thankfully Clannad wasn't adapted from an eroge visual novel like Air or Kanon so the implications aren't TOO severe but at the same time... I just can't ignore that fact. It's like, I know that Nagisa is the one he'll ultimately choose but seeing him move from girl to girl is something that I take umbrage with on so many levels.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other girls, well... I already covered how the moe affects my opinion of them, so I won't go into too much detail about that. However, there are quite a few problems that the girls have with their characterisations that don't pertain to the moe. For instance, Clannad's visual novel roots end up shafting various characters to the side so that a particular girl's story can be covered which I've stated earlier. However, the amount of time each girl receives varies quite a bit. For example, the twins Kyo and Ryo were relegated to the roles of side characters for the vast majority of the season and it wasn't until the Kyo/Ryo OVA at the end of After Story where they finally received some time in the spotlight (similar situation with Tomoyo, but she actually received more screen time). Say what you will about Kanon, but at least each girl barring Nayuki received roughly the same amount of screentime (4-5 episodes each).\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is the fact that certain characters feel rather... familiar, to say the least if you've watched one of the other Kyoto/KEY series beforehand. For example, Nagisa and Fuko are quite literally expies of Shiori and Ayu from Kanon. Much like Shiori, Nagisa is a sickly character who misses quite a lot of school due to her illness with a segment of out-of-place drama, came close to dying, and were saved by a bullshit happy ending. As for Fuko's resemblance to Ayu, let's see: there's a verbal tic (Fuko refers to herself in the third person while Ayu tends to say uguu while sad/frustrated) and astral projections involved. I'll just let you experience both if you want to validate my claims.\\n\\n\r\nNow we come to Akio and Sanae, Nagisa's parents. As far as they go, Akio is passable but Sanae just gets under my skin. She has this running gag where she can't bake for shit and whenever someone insults her baked goods, she runs out crying only for Akio to shove a bunch of bread in his mouth and chase after her. Sanae doesn't really have a lot in the way of a purpose other than to be a MILF/running gag machine and it isn't until after Episode 16 of After Story where she actually has a worthwhile purpose, but I'll get into THAT can of worms when I review After Story.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as Akio goes, he's likeable yet annoying. That's as best as I can phrase it. He's loud, hammy, and obnoxious like someone such as Tamaki-senpai from Ouran HSHC, but that's kind of the reason why I like him. Some of the dialogue and interactions between him, Tomoya, and everyone else was more than enough to make me smile and just seeing him on-screen was more than enough to make me briefly forget what just transpired a few minutes ago, if only for an instant. What I also like about Akio is the fact that he knows when to cut the bullshit and take things seriously like in Nagisa's arc and for that, I applaud him.\\n\\n\r\nMoving away from all of the ranting/babbling about the story and characters, let's take a look at Clannad's production. This was made by Kyoto Animation, and the production values of Clannad really do reflect that quite a bit. Can you really go wrong with a company that has brought us visual treats like the entire Haruhi franchise and Chu-2? All of the backgrounds have an amazing amount of detail put into them and everything is animated with no stutters/jitters and very few drops in qualilty.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the art direction and animation really shine is where we see segments of a little girl who's the only human left in the world that also builds a robot made out of scrap metal. Yes, it is just as bizarre as it sounds and these segments are pretty much pointless until the end of After Story. But that's beside the point, we're talking about the art/animation in these segments. Basically, everything is rendered entirely in CG and for what it does, these segments are amazing to look at and are animated beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER... there are three things that keep Clannad from being a masterpiece in the visual department: First, the moe (which I already covered). Second, the usage of CG (which I'll cover in a minute or two) causes the animation quality to drop in certain places to preserve the budget. Third, some character designs were actually recycled from Kanon. For example, Tomoya and Sunohara are quite literally palette swaps of Yuichi and Kitagawa from Kanon. Don't even get me started on how Akio is basically an older-looking version of Yuichi/Tomoya but with a deeper voice.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the CG, well it works amazingly well for the segments with the girl and the scrap robot. However, Kyoto Animation decided to shoehorn in some CG in the actual show every now and then, and sometimes it just gets rather... off-putting, to say the least. Like there are moments where I'm wondering \"how much money did you guys save by rendering a table fan in CG rather than just using plain old digital animation?\" CG is pretty expensive stuff, so guess what? The animation quality ends up dropping for a minute or two just to preserve the budget for the CG. Thankfully, Kyoto Animation isn't like Gonzo and they do actually prioritise what's important and what isn't, but I can't help but feel that they were being a bit too frivolous.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the art/animation, I don't really have as much praise for the OST. While there were quite a few BGM tracks I liked, it really just served as a complement to what was going on and didn't stand out on its own in any way possible which is quite a shame since a memorable OST is necessary for a romance story to truly shine. The OP theme was something that grated on my ears somewhat, but the ED theme, \"Dango Daikozaku\" was something that I was quite fond of, if only because of the fact that I was grinning like a lunatic whenever Nagisa was singing it in the show because it was so adorable.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice-acting, I can't comment on the Japanese voice-acting so much because I was watching the show subbed so the voices faded into the background but I will say this: Tomoya's VA sounds suspiciously similar to Yuichi's VA in Kanon. The English dub for Clannad is fair enough I guess. Sentai isn't exactly known for making mind-blowingly amazing dubs like Funimation is but at least we've got a few voice actors/actresses outside the realm of Funimation which is always a nice treat. On another note, we also have have the almighty queen of emoting, Luci Christian voicing Nagisa. If you're debating sub or dub, I'd suggest trying the first episode dubbed and see if it works for you. If Luci Christian's performance isn't enough for you, watch it subbed. If it is, dub all the way.\\n\\n\r\nSo... would I say that I enjoyed Clannad? Yes and no. Yes in the sense that it was idle entertainment for whenever I was bored and I wanted to kill an hour or two and there were quite a few moments that I genuinely did enjoy. No in the sense that the more I think about Clannad, the less I like the series as a whole. I genuinely do enjoy After Story but in order for me to truly \"appreciate\" it, I need to take THIS series into account, which leaves me with all kinds of mixed feelings. Maybe if I don't overthink these things, I'd like Clannad as much as everyone else does, but unfortunately... I am an overthinker.\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, Clannad is a par-for-the-course SOL romance visual novel adaptation which doesn't exactly have a lot to stand on. If you're expecting something to make you cry or whatever, that shit happens in After Story. So why shouldn't you skip this season and start with the arguably superior After Story? Eh... I can't think of any reason other than having more context for the events that go on in After Story and also the fact that if you get attached to the characters in the first season, the shit that goes down in After Story will be even more intense (spoiler: I couldn't get attached to the characters here, so After Story was a swing and a miss for me). High scores in art/animation in sound and average scores in story, characters, and enjoyment bring this series out to an even 6.2, which is pretty fair given all of the shit I said so far. With that, I'm out. Peace.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\\n\r\nAt the time of this review, Clannad is licensed by Sentai Filmworks. There are two releases available if I'm not mistaken, sub-only (which Sentai has stopped printing) and sub+dub (what is currently available). The only problem is the fact that the subtitles on the official Clannad DVDs (and the Hulu version if I'm not mistaken) fucking suck. They're rife with spelling/grammar errors and I do believe there was a mistranslation or two as well (don't get me started on how the subtitles are also big, yellow, and ugly). For something that you have to pay money for... it's pretty fucking shit.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also the matter of the way Sentai used to package the discs. They used to come in one of those spindle cases where all the discs are stacked together on one side of the box and a rectangular wad of styrofoam on the other (presumably to prevent the case from sagging or something). If you're not marathoning it, you have to actually take each individual disc out to reach the one you want which seriously risks damaging the discs.\\n\\n\r\nI am aware that Sentai has since re-released it on Blu-ray and the case is MUCH better where each disc comes on its own slot in the case, so I highly recommend getting the new release if you're planning on buying Clannad. I also ended up re-watching Clannad on Amazon Prime, and the subtitles are noticeably better than what I had to put up with on the DVDs but again... not too sure if Amazon Prime was using the Blu-ray release or if that's just something Prime came up with on their own. Whatever, I digress. On with the review!",

            "content": "Clannad, the latest animated series produced by Kyoto Animation is a romantic comedy that revolves around the life of delinquent high school boy and how his presence affects the main heroines around him.\r\nThis being the first of many of KEY's Visual Art works had no level of expectation of how great or enjoyable Clannad was. After getting some advice from a friend, I can firmly conclude, I was not disappointed.\r\n&bull;  Story: \r\nClannad, from the surface, is similar to many harems and high school life animes I've watched, revolving around a high school guy surrounded by bunch of typical harem girls and how his presenceaffects each individually. However, only after truly watching this anime are you able to understand how Clannad is able to surpass the typical harem genre. \\n\\n\r\nClannad is divided into arcs, each arch allocated to each of Clannad's heroines about their past and reasons for their personalities and actions. Clannad does so in a way that is natural, and the movement from arc to arc is smooth and doesn't leave you with the feeling of confusion. - 9/10\\n\\n\r\n&bull; Art:\\n\r\nGiven that Kyoto Animation is known for its superb animation in previous productions, such as The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Kanon 2006, it is no surprise that Clannad has excellent detail and design. From the surroundings, its lighting and its characters, each scene is not too cartoony or realistic, and makes a good balance for you to truly enjoy watching. - 10/10\\n\\n\r\n&bull; Sound:\\n\r\nClannad's ED and OP Theme Songs were of an average standard, and providing a fresh and upbeat tone from the very minute you watch it. However, these songs never really seemed to attach to me, but in the end, don't detract from the overall anime.\\n\r\nWhat really stands out in sound, is Clannad's excellent BGM, from the comedic music during Clannad's numerous funny scenes, that can leave you with stitches for hours, to the sad music during its many tragic moments, that only with them, could the scene truly bring me to tears.  - 8/10\\n\\n\r\n&bull; Character:\\n\r\nClannad's numerous Characters each have different personalities, and in turn, come with different pasts and different difficulties that they have faced in life. Clannad's unique characters and their different stories, breaks your typical &quot;moe&quot; and &quot;loli&quot; type of characters, and truly captivates my attention amongst the hundreds of harems available today. - 9/10\\n\\n\r\n&bull; Enjoyment:\\n\r\nEnjoyment - wise, Clannad provides a joyful feeling after completing this series, a feeling I get only after watching an anime that has truly been a great journey to experience. Rewatching this anime again after finishing it, is equally as enjoyable. - 10/10\\n\\n\r\n&bull; Overall:\\n\r\nOverall, Clannad is a fantastic anime that has really caught my eye, for its uniqueness and its sense of happiness. I highly recommend this anime to anyone who watches anime, because in turn, Clannad is worth every minute that you spend watching it. - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI am so glad, that Kyoto Animation is deciding to anime the second arc to this series!  And I hope you enjoyed this series as much as I did. :)",

            "content": "Note: When I say Clannad, I\u2019m referring to the whole series, including season 1 and season 2 \u2018After Story\u2019 and the extras and OVAs as well. (This is why I've attached this review to each Clannad anime, as this is a review on the whole series. So don't be confused if you see this same review multiple times).\r\nClannad Review \u2013 By Riley D (RIED14):\r\nA dramatically life changing and perception shifting 'slice of life' philosophical masterpiece of love, family, connection, gratitude and simplicity (WITHOUT the ingenuine and uncalled for 'cheesiness'). \r\nClannad was not just a 'good show'. It was an unforgettable experience that drastically rekindled thelight in my eyes and opened up my mind a lot more. Haven't cried like that since I was 5 years old. This has changed me forever.\\n\\n\r\n(Note: If you don't understand it after finishing it, read up on or play the original Visual Novel game which the anime was the adaptation of. That should clear things up for you).\\n\\n\r\nIf you think 'what's the point of living if we die?', Clannad shows you that the anime\u2019s point is \u2018what\u2019 you put in-between life and death.\\n\r\nIt shows you the anime's ideal thing to put in that \u2018in-between slot\u2019, and the character's (and your) journey of realization towards it. Quite an epiphanic anime indeed.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and music were astonishing as both were incredibly capturing and moving at the perfect places in the most natural way possible.\\n\r\nThere is nothing in Clannad that is unnaturally rubbed in the viewer's face. Everything just happens by itself, nothing is desperately forced upon the viewer. Some may beg to differ, but that all comes down to how you view people in real life, weather it depends on the people you\u2019re raised around, the area/country you live in or simply your own way of looking at it etc etc. (Speaking of desperate, there is absolutely NO fan service whatsoever, not even in the extras and OVAs, which is brilliant). Even the humour (to keep the viewer sane) is genuine and reflects off situations that would ACTUALLY HAPPEN in every-day life (my opinion). This is by far the most realistic, touching and insightful anime I've ever experienced.\\n\\n\r\nWARNING: Could be left with a bit of bittersweet \u2018post Clannad depression\u2019 for a few days after finishing the anime, but that shouldn't last long because then you\u2019ll feel the happiest you\u2019ve felt in a long while (well I did anyway).\\n\\n\r\nRecommended to: Anyone.\\n\r\nMy Score: 10 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\n(Believe me this is for anyone. I'm a big fan of 'Higurashi no Naku Koro ni' (which has a lot of gore and horror which Clannad most definitely does not) and I LOVED Clannad, which in the way it's set out, is actually quite similar to Higurashi...[the review ends here, but if you want - read the last few bracketed, unimportant, vague words of the sentence; it's a big Clannad spoiler, so don't if you haven't finished the

The whole anime was so emo-ish and cliched that my eyes hurt.\r\nStory\r\nThe story is about a high school cliche and all I could remember from watching 2 episodes was - Harem. Unrealistic plot (though they tag it as a 'slice of life' anime) and have this angst and despairing thing about this anime. The friendship and romance is clumsy and somewhat awkward. They just either cry or sigh all the time. \r\nArt, Sound & Character\r\nWell, maybe most people willsay the art is pretty good and all but I personally don't like this plastic-type art/animation. The characters has a tone of \"meh-my-life-sucks\". Angst, angst and more angst!\\n\r\nAll of them are annoyingly ordinary. I especially hate that cute-cute brown haired girl and that protagonist. All they do is just mope around and complain!\\n\r\nIf the plot's weak, it's still watchable in case the characters are interesting but if the characters suck more.....I don't know, it's a nightmare!\\n\\n\r\nThe ONLY thing I liked, the title- Clannad. I was willing to take a look at it just because of the title.",

            "content": "This is the third Key anime that Kyoani has produced, and I believe that it has some really big shoes to fill. If this was made by any other company then I would immediately recognize this as an absolute masterpiece and not dare to say anything bad about it, but I'm going to be extremely picky here. I'm going to talk about a lot of the bad aspects of this anime, but be sure that if I were as specific about the good things then this review would be 5 pages long. The reason I chose not to talk about a lot of this isbecause it is very similar to other Key animes and I would just be repeating reviews for Air and Kanon.\\n\r\nLike most people, I believe the series is most similar to Kanon, also made by Kyoani and Key. I'm not going to go into detail about how godly these two companies are but I can tell you that Kanon was just incredible. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nAs a Key game, I believe I can put great faith in the story. Almost every one of their production starts off looking like a standard harem anime but takes a turn into a deep, mysterious and emotional plotline that is almost sure to make you cry. I haven't played the game, and I don't think I will because I don't want to spoil what happens. I was a bit skeptical at first, but I feel like the story has lots of potential. I wasn't really fond of the first arc because it seemed so unoriginal, but the episodes that followed allowed me to enjoy the story again. Like every other anime Kyoani makes, there are a lot of random things that happen in the plot, but they have always been tied up in the end and I will trust for it to happen with this series as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is amazing as always with Kyoani, and I am glad that they have not let me down here. One thing that they do great is expressing the seasons through spectacular backgrounds, I really hope they have wider shots for scenes. The camera is a lot more lively in Clannad, which helps attract the viewer's attention. In terms of art, everything is perfect.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe OP in this anime is just great, and one of my favorites. I wish I could say the same about the ending. The first time I heard it it was funny, the second and third time it was cute, and then it just got annoying after that. \\n\r\nSometimes the voice overs are done in a weird way, but you soon get used to it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are always the best part of Key animes. Every character is incredibly cute and likable but has a weird part which seems mysterious until you learn more about. As you watch the series, you gain great insight and understanding of the characters. I guarantee that you will fall in love with one if not all of the characters in this anime. The protagonist is very well portrayed and getting into his mind is very entertaining.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nKanon and Air take you on an emotional roller coaster, with parts that make you cry and parts that make you laugh and simply feel great. Clannad shows some signs of this too but it concentrates on the humor a lot more. The jokes are HILARIOUS, there hasn't been one episode where I haven't laughed out loud which is really impressive. I enjoy this anime a lot, even more then Kanon at some parts, but the enjoyment is not consistent. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I feel that this anime is great, and some parts are unparalleled. People that have watched kanon already might feel that it is not as great, and although some aspects of it surpass kanon, I can't say it is better overall. Still, I recommend that all anime lovers watches this series.",

            "content": "A person I used to work with recommended this anime to me many years ago. We got on the topic of anime and wondered what an anime made about us would look like. We concluded that it would be boring and the fan service would be awful since our manager was an obese lady in her 50s. He then said however that while our lives were boring, Clannad is an anime that taught him that there's always hope and the drama and romance here gave him a new meaning in life.\r\nI have now come to suspect that he must have been under the influence ofsome strong narcotics either while watching Clannad or while describing it to me. Or maybe both, because I seriously can't see anything in this anime that would elicit such emotions from a healthy human being. The only emotions that inhabited me while watching Clannad were those of boredom and disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nWith that introduction out of the way, I will review this anime section by section to make my opinion on Clannad as clear as possible. Also, this will be my longest and most elaborate review ever. If you're not prepared to read what is essentially an essay about Clannad, turn away now.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe story and setting aren't that bad, that is to say the story certainly had potential if it wasn't plagued by outlandish characters who then proceeded to destroy any glimmer of hope I had that this anime might actually be good. While it started out okay as the story established the male lead (Tomoya) well and the world that surrounds him we're then slapped with some peculiar alien life forms (the female cast of Clannad) that kill any realism the story might have otherwise had. Apart from the fact that the girls in this show seem to have the mental capacity of an ostrich, they are also linked by an awful harem sub plot and thus you simply don't feel the apparent maturity of the characters. Quite the contrary, it seems as if one was watching the lives of 4 year olds at a nursery school.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is Clannad's use of the supernatural. I was ready to buy Tomoya's story, his family problems etc. I could even relate to it. Then in comes Fuuko's arc and with it a horde of absolutely superficial and forced plot points. Once you're done eating the superfluous drama Clannad then gives you a side order of quasi-philosophy that just makes you cringe and comes off as utterly ridiculous. Unless you helped a poltergeist with marriage arrangements at some point in your life then you won't have anything to relate to in here.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the apparent romance aspect between the male lead and the rest of the female characters is non-existent to the very end. Clannad's makers have a very tame idea of romance. While the girls long after Tomoya, they do very little that would push them in the direction of a romantic relationship. It's not until the last few episodes that the girls wake up \"shit, I should have done something\" but again no initiative. Likewise, with Tomoya not even caring about any of it we get very little material here that would make us believe that there is in fact some form of attraction between these characters. You're simply meant to believe they're all in love with each other without any reference material. It's the maker's way of saying \"we're too busy with the superficial drama, make up your own list of reasons as to why the characters are romantically interested in each other\".\\n\\n\r\nThe potential was there, but ultimately it was ruined by a combination of awful characters, unrealistic and ridiculous plot points and of course fake drama. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (2/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Clannad shoots itself in the face - with a howitzer artillery piece. The characters that we're meant to believe are teenagers look and act like children. I don't know what monstrosity Nagisa is meant to be but she sure as hell scared the hell out of me. It's like watching one of those slow and silent patients at a mental asylum, half-expecting them to jump on you at any moment in a mania-driven fit. It goes for the entire female cast of Clannad. They're unnatural and unrealistic representations of modern teenagers. \\n\\n\r\nBut it doesn't stop there - the adults in Clannad behave like... teenagers. Who would have thought? An example of that would be Akio constantly chasing Sanae and showing off in front of her on any occasion. Now that's what teenagers do. Getting teary because you dropped a deck of cards or shouting random words to motivate yourself in any given social situation? That's infantile behavior and that's how the teenagers here are portrayed. Clannad has it all messed up. If they were any seniors in this anime they would probably behave like adults.\\n\\n\r\nThe only two glimmers of hope were Tomoya and Sunohara but again Clannad succeeds in making sure those two characters are ruined from the outset. Sunohara becomes the victim of something we could consider to be comic relief, though it's mostly about him getting mutilated by a girl who can dish out a 1,000 kicks per second (read: Clannad's slice of life realism). It gets boring quickly, then annoying and then you need to force yourself to watch each consecutive episode. \\n\\n\r\nTomoya on the other hand starts copying the behaviors of the female cast. While initially a delinquent with a vast repository of confidence he becomes more shy and retarded as the show progresses. The last episode of Clannad is a testament to that where all his confidence and honesty seems to have withered away and he struggles to even hold the hand of a person he supposedly loves where he didn't seem to have any problems touching girls (in a non sexual way, mind you) early in the show. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the characters are a complete failure of this anime and I couldn't take any of them seriously, relate to them in any way or feel emotionally moved by their stories. \\n\\n\r\nART (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe designs of the characters are ridiculous. The girls look like powdered doughnut holes with appendages. Clannad superbly overdosed on the \"moe\" aspect here and the massive eyes, coupled with those huge round heads and hair that seem to stick out to low-earth orbit make you feel uneasy. Fuuko's portrayal was the epitome of this \"moeness\". Supposedly a teenager too, she literally looks like a 5 year old. Again, you can't take the characters seriously because each time an emotional scene rolls on by you can't help but notice the stark contrast between the exaggerated sweetness of the characters and the supposedly dramatic and grim situation at hand. Clannad contradicts itself in this respect. It's trying to be happy and sad at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nThe males are actually no different. Both Sunohara and Tomoya look like heads of 7 year olds screwed on to the bodies of 18 year olds. What the hell is up with that. Sunohara in particular. A lot of the time he was drawn with a bunny-like smile on his face. Half a minute later there's an emotional scene and Clannad expects you to forget about that nonsense you just saw. It just doesn't work.\\n\\n\r\nAnd guess what. Yes, adults look like teenagers. Akio, Sanae, the couple from Fuuka's arc, most of the teachers at school etc. The only exceptions to this rule would be Tomoya's father and one of the male teachers at school (forgot his name). You grow accustomed to this style as you progress through Clannad but the first few episodes will have you cringing with disbelief. \\n\\n\r\nApart from that, the art that pertains to buildings, nature etc is actually decent. The fields, trees and other stationary objects have been drawn precisely and it looks really nice in HD so I suppose the art department does deserve some commendation for their work but that's not enough to make up for the alien character farce.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department is the only component of Clannad that I feel deserves a good rating. I found myself being emotionally influenced by the beautiful OST more than the extra-terrestrial cast or their silly stories. It has to be said, that if there's one thing that Clannad did well, it would be the music. I feel disappointed however that it had to be wasted on an anime like this. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is another thing entirely. To complement the childish looks of Clannad's characters, the voice actors have probably been told to sound like children too because that's the only explanation I can find for Sunohara's screechy voice. Likewise, most of the cast will sound a lot younger than what they're apparently meant to be. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (3/10)\\n\\n\r\nI almost didn't get any. Almost because the music was actually enjoyable and soothing. The beginning of Clannad where we get to meet Tomoya was kind of interesting and enjoyable too but that didn't last long. Watching this anime past that point just felt like a chore. I was constantly thinking about dropping it and had to force myself to watch it. It took me a grand total of a month to finish this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAll things considered Clannad was a dreadful experience and that's mostly the fault of the characters. If the story of Clannad was presented by a different studio that focused on more believable characters as well as eliminating the absolutely stupid sub-plots (Fuuko) then I am certain that I would enjoy it more.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nA grade of 4 is appropriate. Initially the story had some strength. Guy meets girl and suddenly the world looks better. I can buy that if it's executed in the proper way. Clannad however does everything but that. The characters are a complete disaster. The art is a mixed bag, as in awful character design and good CGI & backdrop imagery. The music is actually very good and emotionally engaging while voice acting completes the ridiculousness of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Clannad fails at every tag attached to it. It fails at drama, romance, slice of life, supernatural.. and as I mentioned many times before - mostly because of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've ready this far - congratulations. Feel free to leave a comment on my profile if you wish to discuss Clannad with me.",

            "content": "While I usually find writing something about anything hard I think I can make an exception for this show.\r\nBefore Clannad, I had only watched action anime (most with a little romance involved) but this was my first venture outside of the genre and I'm glad I did it although it was never intended. After exhausting pretty much every reputable action series I decided to give another genre a shot. Every site I went to mentioned this series so I decided to give it a try.\r\nFrom the first two episodes I could tell it was different from anything, as many have described it as \"poetry\" andI completely agree. Even as I write this i look back on how much the series moved me and genuinely inspired me to be a better person.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Tomoya, shares many of the same characteristics as most males in the center of harems. He seems oblivious, undesirable, not wanting a relationship of any sort and yet he has several to choose from. However, the 'hero', if you will is not as oblivious as he appears at first recognizing each of the girls' feelings while not allowing his preferred relationship to try and interfere with their's. While I only gave it a 9 (the art seems outdated for 2015 but its not really an issue) this is truly the greatest series I've ever watched as it pulled me along an emotional journey of many real-life situations and I can't wait to watch After Story.",

            "content": "There are many types of anime, though you can generalise them in being either fulfilling your expectations, or not. However, every so often, there is an exception of a unique anime which is by far superior though you never expected it to be. The latter defineately describes clannad.\r\n I started with no expectations from clannad, but it turned out to be one of the best anime I have ever seen, if not the best.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nOn the outside it seems to be the ordinary slice of life drama - ordinary boy meets many girls, helps them, and in the end benefits too (not to forgetthe touch of harem). But clannad is different in that it pulls on your heartstrings, making you go through every emotion: you cry, you laugh. You smile with pride, frown with dismay. The best aspect of it was the comedy, which was perfectly executed and the humour was intelligent and witty.\\n\r\nEvery story arc you can easily understand and relate to, and each one is unique and spectacular. The main storyline is also just as good, with some mysterious aspects (there is a parallel little story about a little girl all alone in the world with a robot).\\n\r\nI liked the fact that the story wasn't all centred around the main character, but it portrays many different storylines in which our main protagonists just happens to be there to help.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9.5/10\\n\r\n I found the art very soothing and beautiful to watch, it used soft colours and textures which portray the scenes and emotions well. The designs of the characters were also unique to each individual, and you enjoy watching them.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe opening of the series I never grew to like, though the ending song 'dango' was extremely cute. The other music used throughout the series however, was exceptional. It flowed with the mood of the scenes perfectly and even to listen to it by itself is enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9.5/10\\n\r\nThe characters in clannad were very well developed, you are able to gradually build a detailed picture for each one and understand their personalities; almost at a personal level. Every character has a warm feel, and you have a wonderful time in their company.\\n\r\n I especially liked the main protagonist, Tomoya, he has a very direct and witty personality which anyone would instantly love, and is the centre of conducting all the comedy scenes. As the story progresses, you learn more about him and start to understand and relate to him more.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\n I enjoyed every second of this anime - it was done perfectly in every aspect, but I especially enjoyed the comedy aspects to it which were hilarious. It had the correct balance of everything you would want in a slice of life drama.\\n\r\n I can guarentee whoever you are, and whatever anime you may like, you will at least enjoy parts of this anime.\\n\\n\r\n I'm sorry if this review is rubbish, it's hard to describe something which is so good that its indescribable. To understand it, you can really only experience it for yourself. I strongely recommend clannad, you will not regret it.",

            "content": "I swear, it's criminal how CLANNAD has been shortchanged so horribly by the polarity of the opinions of the people who watched it. For good or bad.\r\nSTORY:\r\nThe premise is less than ordinary, though understandable, considering this started out as a visual novel (read: harem). KyoAni has done a decent job on adapting the game paths into one coherent story, but there are a couple of significant errors.\r\n1. Fuuko path. Dragged wayyyy long. The BAW atmosphere was beautiful, but when you try and stretch it over 7 episodes (and sacrificing the time for the other characters' arcs) it becomes a chore. It becomes worse when you'recrying and yawning at the same time.\\n\r\n2. The other arcs. Thanks to Fuukodrag, all the other characters had to suffer from big reductions to their paths. Kyou and Ryou, and Kotomi to a lesser extent, all suffered from this, such that Kyou and Ryou's arcs seemed almost like an afterthought.\\n\r\n3. Inconsistency in tone. As a result of the two factors above, we went from long-drawn, depressing BAAAAAW to rushed, wow-that-was-fast. Which was really jarring.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nKyoAni, for all its reputation on its production value, showed a lack of consistency for this anime on one thing. The one flaw that jumps out at me - the mouths are almost always differently positioned between episodes. And at certain moments, it looked almost as if their chins took up the entire lower portion of their faces. A big part of it is undoubtedly due to the unfortunate placing of the mouth right in the middle of the face in the visual novel (lol Key), but then I'd have expected KyoAni to get their animators to stick to the same position. The art and quality is otherwise fine, and the animation is top-notch.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nSimple, and generally well-matched, if underwhelming. A lot of it is lifted straight from the visual novel, and I find most to be unimpressive, except for the ones in the Fuuko arc.\\n\r\nThe ED was beautiful though.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nI mentioned earlier that they dragged out Fuuko's arc too long. This has another consequence - some of the characters are not well-developed. Kyou and Ryou had potential, but their arcs were too short. Also, the girl-by-girl order the KyoAni decided to go with caused another problem - girls that were all the focus the previous arc would simply almost disappear from the story from then on. Again it's understandable, but its still something that (with the exception of Fuuko which needed no workaround) wasn't resolved.\\n\r\nWhat KyoAni did do right, however, they did very well. Fuuko was so endearing and the developments so heart-tugging that it left a deep impression on me for a long time. And Kotomi, despite the shorter arc length, was similarly well developed, and so was Nagisa, the main girl. Even Sunohara, the side guy, got in a bit of development.\\n\r\nWhich is commendable, considering that their characters are all rather cliched, and typical. Which again, is all due to the source material.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nI wouldn't lie, I enjoyed it mostly. The BAAAAAW moments, and the trademark KyoAni humour injections, done to perfection, were great. However, many times I found myself wondering when the episode would end. Major markdown.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nDecent, but one can't help but feel that KyoAni could have planned the pacing much better. Plus, it doesn't help being too faithful to a source material which is not adaptation-friendly. Though I guess this couldn't be helped, considering this is what KyoAni is known for, and it's an image they want to keep.",

            "content": "Clannad, a series that is top of the slice of life genre but does it deserve to be there? Short answer no. Clannad is a series with an incredible loyal fanbase from both Kyoani and Key, this fanbase is the key to the ridiculously high rating this anime obtains. Before I get started I want to break down this review into a short sentence, the first series \"Clannad\" (not after story) is overrated due to everyone's reaction to the second season, people mindlessly give this anime a 10 because they rated after they had watched both series rather than prior to watching After Story.\r\nStory 5/10\r\nThisis one thing I want to clarify to all anime watches, it is nearly impossible to have a 10/10 story in a slice of life anime. This is the story of the life of Tomoya Okazaki as he goes through a semster of highschool. Like in any slice of life he comes across hurdles in order to get to point where we see the joys of his life. It's meh, the same formula rehashed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10\\n\r\nThis is where slice of life is strong and clannad, for the most part, lacks a strong cast of characters. Disregarding Tomoya and Nagisa, we are left with a plane group of teenagers with our rehashes of key's prior works. The only shining characters outside of the main cast are the parents of Nagisa who make for a nice change.\\n\\n\r\nMusic 8/10\\n\r\nIt's Kyoani, the one thing they are known for is music and animation, in this anime they did not disappoint, especially in the music department.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 7/10\\n\r\nVery Simple, honestly wasn't the greatest thing of it's time but there were many beautiful scenes in the anime which is why I gave it that scores.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\r\nI believe Clannad is a work that, once again, has been ruined by Kyoto Animation, it had the possibilities but it was poorly executed. This anime is meant for people who are impulsive, who like to emote, not for someone who rationally thinks about things eg strength of plot/characters and I believe the scores that Clannad gets are reflective of the childish fanbase that this anime has accumulated. At the end of the day music and animation don't make an anime amazing, it's the plot and characters which make us think that truly make the anime great.",

            "content": "Warning to ALL:This review contains high doses of sarcasm, nihilism and traces of mature language. So if you're not old enough to buy playboy i suggest that you stay away or else you'll find yourself smoking meth...Or so says the internet\r\nWith that outta the way, Clannad....\r\nI really don't know where to start with this one. Oh wait i got it, I HOPE YOU BURN IN HELL KYOTO ANIMATION, i hope each and every one of you will be screaming in agony. This sickening ass product from the dark pits of hell comes from the same pillocks that brought upon us 2 other plagues, Kanon andAir....The same moe filled croissant as most other VN's,with empty, shallow, soulless, pathetic, idiotic,daft....Girls whose only purpose is to be easy enough for the protagonist to trick so he can stick his sausage in them. THAT'S IT.. You sick pedo's watching this stuff should be locked in prison for the rest of your lives.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, like in every other \"masterpiece\" i've reviewed i expect fanbitches to get their internet weapons ready and with tears in their eyes write harsh words..Oh please fruitcakes i don't give a shit about the opinions of otaku wannabes who slam their keyboards in anger..Trust me sunshines i haven't even started, this is where the fun starts.\\n\\n\r\nAnd when i say fun i actually mean terrible misery. That is what you get for watching this moe crap. I've read many reviews before i watched this and all i got was:\"It will move every fiber of your heart, you're gonna cry your eyes out in emotional pain\"....I watched it lads and all i got was some food coming out the wrong way and i was completely and utterly untouched..Clannad starts with one of the most pretentious openings in anime history. It starts with our male lead Tomoya on his way to school where he sees this girl Nagisa talking to herself. The timing is no coincindence, it was just the right time for him to hear what he needed to start his pussy conquest. Then she turns and..Welcome eyes the size of football pitch, with enough space to park a space station between them.. They, then, become friends and practice for surviving in hell starts. From there on the protagonist \"conviniently\" meets women with enough problems to write at least 70 psychology books about. It's like watching a cheaply made softcore porn from the 80's. A sprinkling of a \"plot\" here, some development that makes sense to...Nobody at all...And you hitting your head against the wall.\\n\\n\r\nRight from the get go, this anime shows shamelessly its' contrived, unrealistic and outright stupid colours. It expects us to diss reality and start believing that teenage girls have the mentality of 5 yr olds and they speak with noises. To be honest some do, BUT NOT TO THIS EXTENT. How the hell am i supposed to react and connect with such one sided, infantile pathetic excuses for characters? At least the AGU UGU and all that sounds girls make when you punch them, from the other 2 cancerous animes are mostly gone..But the girls still sound and appear to be retards. It's like they missed a step in evolution. I'll say it again and again. This can only appeal to pedophiles or people with a weird necrophilia fetish. I can't for the life of me explain how people find such noises cute.\\n\\n\r\nMy other big prob was the animation. I cannot possibly stomach the art. Those eyes with that gap between them? Seriously the gap is as big as the gap between 2 tower blocks. Don't believe me? Do you remember Sid from Ice Age? If not Google is your friend..Look at his eyes and then look at Nagisa's..Sid's eyes aren't as fucking huge, otherwise the placement is spot on. Oh yeah i forgot it's moe, it's cute,it makes funny cute nois....SHUT IT, just like that. It's rubbish attempt at artificial cuteness that makes my stomach churn and it's taken to such extremes it becomes disgusting really quick. No surpsise then that this is the darling of child molesters and those who have built a shrine to pray to the MOE Gods in their basement... Where they also live.. I suspect those gods have eyes the size of a small moon too!\"\\n\\n\r\nEnough with that, let's look at them as characters. Like the design they're completely childish with fluttering eyelashes who only communicate with squeeking words, giggling throughout the entire show. We are supposed as viewers to believe that not only this reflects reality but also that these girls are so intelligent they can solve DaVinci's code in 2 secs. And trust me they're not even close to anything resembling smart. In fact i liked the characters the most when i wasn't looking at the screen. You can almost hear the suggestions made to the voice actors. Here you must feed drama to the viewer. This line should sound like something emotional is happening....It's so forced it's ridiculous, I would go as far as to tell you who are all the characters but there is no point. There are only girls with hair colours from the whole spectrum. That's the only distiction between them.\\n\\n\r\nI don't have any strength left to write. It's pointless. Once again like Air and Kanon you're force fed the drama burger. And the drama is sooooooooooooooooooooooo badly executed with unbelievable and outrageously melodramatic storylines. It's like a competition to see which girls dramatic past is more ridiculous. I admit though that i cried a lot while watching this anime..From laughing so hard that is. I may have damaged my internal organs badly laughing. I honestly haven't seen such forced, laughable drama in ages. And i'm 31 now, so i've lived through the wretched 80's and 90's, where spantex was fashion.\\n\\n\r\nI had to force myself through this, i didn't like it one bit and once again i have to wonder about the mentality of those who recommended this to me and also of those who ranked it so high. It's almost like every other harem rubbish. The only difference is that those other rubbish aren't praised by the community for reasons unknown to man.\\n\r\nIt's rubbish at drama, it's just only good at comedy, it has no story, the characters are as bad as herpes...God help us indeed if people saw this and thought:\"Oh fuck yeah that was the best thing i ever saw\".",

A character does not have to have a hyperactive personality to be a good character (and in this case the hyperactive girls abusive girls are horrible cliches), but a character has to have something different than characters we have seen other places, and absolutely none of that is presented here. Fuuko is the closest to an original personality, and the episodes centered around her are still annoying because of the extremely slow pace, the fact that nobody cares about a girl being \"cutely\" obsessed with starfish except people obsessed with the completely false idea of \"moe\", and that Fuuko's plan is to...get complete strangers to attend her sister's wedding.\\n\\n\r\n(Nagisa's dad is a cliche in his own right, but still easily the best character in the anime)\\n\\n\r\nThe character art is disgusting, the voice acting for several of the girls is disgusting. The music is horrible and incessant.\\n\\n\r\nWhen we are not enduring pathetically slowly explained tragedies, we are getting awesome jokes like remember that time Nagisa's mom was teased, you know the exact same way 7-1 billion times. It was never funny, it could never be funny, and that is what this series is - not tragic, not funny, not serene, and obviously not exciting. Just another incredibly tame harem where every character is paper thin and nobody gets laid (duh, sex ain't moe!!).",

For all of it's amazing reviews, season 1 of Clannad is a piece of work so overwhelmingly cookie-cutter that it may in fact be the most overrated romance story of all time.\r\nFirst, let me discuss what I liked about Clannad. Comedy is undeniably the best feature in thisotherwise lackluster show. The comedic moments were scattered throughout the series, and were generally centered around either the MC liking to mess with people, the MCs sidekick friend doing something stupid, and Nagisa's dad being Nagisa's dad. Any scene with Nagisa's dad (Akio) is automatically gold, and that's a fact. Overall, the comedic antics in this show helped bring life to the otherwise stale and overplayed plot.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's get to the plot. The plot of the show feels like a poorly paced adaptation of a bland, generic harem visual novel. Look! The MC is a delinquent and nobody likes him. Except for the girls who keep showing up in his life and inexplicably falling for him. I wonder which one he will choose! Aside from there being nothing original nor interesting about any of the characters (except Akio), the entire story itself is weak and poorly paced, attempting to develop the girls in his harem but ultimately rushing through development and not even attempting to explain why most of these girls like him. \\n\\n\r\nI cannot begin to count how many times I rolled my eyes at this series, especially during the second half. The anime had spent so much time attempting to give backstories to side characters that it completely neglected the arguably most important girl until about episode 20. Until then she can literally be characterized as \"she's there in the background somewhere\". \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's where my other main issue with Clannad is - the character motivations don't make sense. People tell me that things are explained better in the visual novel, but this isn't the visual novel. I should be able to understand why a character feels a certain way about another character after watching 23 episodes of a show, especially when those feelings are the entire premise to Afterstory. And yet, due to poor (or nonexistent) character development and pacing, I find myself having a hard time believing any of the feelings that these characters have towards one another, causing their actions to make little sense. Viewers have to so boldly suspend their disbelief just to accept things that should be second nature to any well-written show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, Clannad is absolutely nothing special. The only reason this show is ranked so high is because season 1 rides on the coattails of the success and acclaim of Afterstory. However, the show isn't outright terrible. It may be cliche and underwhelming, but it certainly could have been worse in many aspects. The primary reason I write this review is because of how grossly overrated Clannad is. The best way to see this show is as a necessary evil to those who want to watch Afterstory. Attempting to get more out of this show than that will leave you dissatisfied.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSide note - for those who want to watch Afterstory, I recommend watching the recap episode of season 1 and then starting Afterstory at episode 8. I guarantee that you will not miss anything.",

            "content": "Our society nowadays has the habit of trivializing High School romance. I lay blame at the feet of the Disney movies, putting unrealistic expectations into the heads of young children. Years later when they have a legitimate crush, they equate it to love in just three weeks. The rest of us are just nodding along with small smiles, silently counting down the days until reality hits them on the head with a baseball bat.\r\nIs that a slight hyperbole? Yeah, probably. But it still holds true that we view teenage relationships with a bit of apprehension. It is odd then that the most popular (and mostpraised) romance anime takes place in high school. I'm going to be honest, I have no clue why this anime is viewed with such reverence. Clannad and it's sequel series Clannad After Story are by far and away viewed as the pinnacle of their genre. While most of the praise is reserved for the sequel series, Clannad itself has many rabid fans waiting to pounce and explain why it is worthy of such praise and devotion. I'm here to provide an alternate perspective, I don't think this is one of the most emotionally compelling anime there is. In fact, I found the romance of this anime to be the show's greatest hindrance (I will elaborate on that shortly, don't discount me just yet, save that for later).\\n\\n\r\nOh, and one more thing to mention, this show is a harem. BOOM, take it fans! Fuck your painfully biased opinions, allow my foot to make contact with your ass and send you flying into a large target with CLANNAD'S A HAREM painted in the center. Yes, Clannad's a harem. That being said, it is vastly different from the general thoughts applied to that genre. This show has more emotion attached, the main character doesn't get a \"harem ending\", and there aren't as many accidental sexual situations for the main character to get slapped. But it is still a harem. To quote the synopsis, *AHEM* \"Claiming he has nothing better to do, he decides to help her achieve this goal along with the help of four other girls.\" One guy (most of the time) and four girls. Accept the truth people, accept the truth.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, onto the meat of the review:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nLet me make one thing clear, Clannad's story and premise deserve better than a 5. The reason the score loses so many points is due to the execution. Clannad was my first foray into an adaptation of a romance visual novel. Prior to starting the series I expected genuine wonderment as to which girl the main character would end up with. Unfortunately that expectation was brutally murdered in the first few minutes as we met the main heroine (only heroine, if we're being entirely honest) of the story. If you have a brain you can immediately predict the ending of Clannad, it is so obvious you almost second guess yourself thinking it couldn't possibly be that obvious. That itself is not an issue. The issue arises when this show introduces other heroines and their feelings expecting us to latch onto the belief that these girls stand a chance.\\n\r\nAll of the other characters had their stories and problems that were explored, and they really weren't bad, but I had to question their existence in this story. What was the point? Why introduce these characters and their stories? We all know that the main heroine is going to emerge the victor per se; so why not focus on her and the main character and their lives/friends rather then introducing pointless love rivals? Having more than one love interest can certainly be an interesting plot point, but this anime fails in execution completely as we meet a girl, say hi, help her out, before saying goodbye and returning to the main heroine. Said girl then becomes a very obvious side-character and is scarcely mentioned again.\\n\r\nThis show is ultimately a character driven show, and the story should have focused on them more as a collective rather than honing in on the romance between only two...\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty solid. It was easy on the eyes with a nice, and bright color palette. Overall it is nothing to write home about, but I have nothing negative to say.\\n\r\nThe character designs are exceedingly moe. I still don't even know how to define that word, but these characters are all cute and adorable blobs of moe. Whether you like the character designs or not is entirely based on one's own tastes. Some people cannot stand seeing these older characters with cute childlike faces, an understandable perspective. Others love those designs, and others (like myself) just don't care.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe OST does its job. When watching this show whatever track is playing will undoubtedly compliment the scene. But I'll be honest, I don't recall a single track from this entire anime.\\n\r\nThe voice acting for this anime is hit or miss. To compliment the moe aspect of the animation, the voices of certain characters will sound exceedingly childlike. This touches back to that idea of personal preference, some will like this, others will not. Now granted, that is just the sub, but the dub is most definitely something I would not recommend. The dub has the opposite issue of the sub, so that many of the voices sound like they belong to people 5-10 years older than high school. The acting in the dub certainly isn't bad, but it just feels wrong.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nOn first appearance most of these characters can be filed into some sort of cliche. The nice one, the delinquent, the tsundere, the class president, the naive one, the eccentric, and finally the perverted best friend. So with a bunch of cliches why am I giving a score of 8? The answer is that nearly every character in this show receives excellent development. Even minor characters aren't left stagnant.\\n\\n\r\nTomoya Okazaki- The main character of this show. He is introduced as a school delinquent with a dour disposition. He is a pretty solid character. Avoiding spoiler territory, he has a fairly sad history and his demeanor towards life is understandable knowing that. He is fairly sarcastic at times and was by and large a good character.\\n\\n\r\nNagisa Furukawa- Ugh, here we have the main heroine of the story. Ya know, I don't dislike Nagisa. It is nigh impossible to dislike this girl. She is the cliche nice girl I spoke of earlier. She is also a character I feel doesn't get a ton of development. Sure she also has a history, but she is forever the sweet nice girl. For a character that is really the second main character, I found this to be extremely disappointing. There is a line in the sequel series in which the main character thinks to himself that Nagisa is one in a million. My thoughts on the matter were akin to \"Umm, not really. I can think of a dozen other nice girls that could fill her role almost to a tee.\"\\n\r\nMany would vehemently disagree with me, saying Nagisa is an awesome character with incredible development. Really though, Nagisa's \"development\" comes from her parents. She is the only character who's family is really shown, and she benefits from it greatly. Her parents are both very solid characters, Akio and Sanae Furukawa are both good characters, and they provide a backdrop for people to like Nagisa. If you had given any of the other heroines half as much screen time as Nagisa they would've been far better characters.\\n\\n\r\nKyou Fujibayashi- The tsundere. The end.\\n\r\nNo, not really. Kyou initially appears as no more than your average tsundere, but develops far beyond that. Kyou is my personal favorite character in this show. Her relationship with Tomoya is extremely funny to watch as they have a constant back-and-forth friendship. She is also very devoted to assisting her sister in her relationship endeavors with Tomoya, a very good sister, actually.\\n\\n\r\nKotomi Ichinose- The genius girl that is naivety personified. She also has a good history and it becomes apparent thanks to spoilers I will not be mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nTomoyo Sakagami- The class president. Ok, not yet, class president is one of her goals though. She is also an impossibly good fighter capable of reaching 1000 hit combos that the show will even track for you. Tomoyo is a really honest character that gives off an almost intimidating persona.\\n\\n\r\nThe issue with reviewing these characters is that I cannot accurately describe them without going into extensive spoilers. That's the degree of development we see from all of them. So my descriptions are only what can be viewed on the surface, but that is due to the fact that discovering these character's true value was my greatest treat in watching this show.\\n\r\nThe above characters are the main male along with the \"heroines\" (Fuuko isn't a heroine!) There are a good number of lesser characters, but many of them are good characters in their own right. You have the very cute, very eccentric Fuuko Ibuki. She likes knives and starfish, and that's about all you need to know. She isn't particularly deep as a character, but is very amusing. You then have Ryou Fujibayashi, Kyou's twin sister who is a lot kinder. MAL has Ryou listed as a main, but she really isn't. She was side-lined a bit in favor of her sister.\\n\r\nYouhei Sunohara is the perverted best friend. He is also a delinquent slacker and really doesn't develop past that. The final notable side characters are the aforementioned parents of Nagisa, Akio and Sanae Furukawa. They really are two of the coolest parents in anime, and they receive some solid development as side-characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nI really did enjoy these characters. I thought their interactions with one another were entertaining and well done. The reason I cannot label my enjoyment above a 5 however, is due to the romance. A bit odd, right? This show is most accurately a slice of life romance, and I think it would have benefited from just being a slice of life. I say that ignoring the sequel series, I know the two are always spoken in tandem, but you have to look at them as individual stories. Having this show as a romance took away from some of the of amazing aspects of the characters.\\n\r\nThough my least favorite aspect (prepare thy selves for a highly polarized opinion) is the relationship between Tomoya and Nagisa. I really just didn't see how the two would work as a couple. Nothing about them ever seemed to mesh. I would have preferred to see Tomoya with literally every other heroine besides Nagisa as I thought each one of them would have been a better fit. These thoughts constantly nagging at my brain led to a not-so-enjoyable viewing experience as every emotional moment between Tomoya and Nagisa had me lamenting on how this could have unfolded with the other heroines. So take that factor with a large grain of salt, my opinion in that facet is by no means the norm. You may love their relationship, but it really did not work for me...\\n\\n\r\nI also feel the need to mention the fact that as an emotional experience, this show did very, very little for me. I have been told many a times that I have a black heart, but that is not quite true. Though I have never cried in an anime (I have come close), I do feel emotional in certain scenes. But in Clannad, there were only two occasions I felt even a modicum of sadness. And from what I have read on forums, they aren't even the scenes many feel are heartbreaking.\\n\r\nIf popular opinion is any sort of judge, I am an outlier in the emotion department. So for many who read this, you may still feel the incredible emotion that is commonly associated with this franchise. But for others that find themselves more emotionally disconnected, you likely won't find Clannad to be anything special.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nThis show's high points from my not-so-humble perspective is most definitely the characters. Even the cliches are fun to watch. But sadly, the meat of this anime is the romance, and I believe it failed.\\n\r\nFrom an objective perspective, I cannot lay a ton of fault at the feet of this anime. But my goal all along was to provide a perspective that wasn't mindless hate, but wasn't blind worship either. This show lost almost all of its points because of my opinion on the how the story unfolded. Because of that this review may sink down into the tresses of MAL's databases as its unhelpful ratio grows ever larger. \\n\r\nIf you are the type that can hone in on said romance and like it, by all means, go watch this anime right now. If you love what many believe to be emotional roller coasters, by all means, go watch this anime right now. I even encourage you to watch it now as it's sequel series takes those aspects and increases their effectiveness exponentially. But for everyone else, don't bother unless you have nothing else to watch. This show isn't bad, and certainly isn't a waste of time, but it's not a show I would label as high priority at all.",

            "content": "*Re-upload as the first review was pretty bad to be honest*\r\n*This is just a review of Clannad and does not take into account any of the events which occur in After Story*\r\nClannad is a series that I never believed that I would watch due to my particular tendency to watch more action orientated anime. So when a friend of mine forced me to watch it I wasn't expecting to continue it. So lo and behold I am here having watched the whole series within the space of three days, something I thought I would never do, writing this review. So without further ado let uscommence.\\n\\n\r\nStory- 7.0\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Clannad revolves around a slacker by the name of Tomoya Okazaki and his interactions with multiple girls within his high school. There are several arcs, each of which focuses on one of the girls but the overall story focuses on the rebuilding of the discontinued drama club. The overall plot of the show is somewhat forgettable but the arcs themselves are good. In particular the first arc was brilliant, mixing comedy with emotion to the point where I was laughing in one scene and tearing up in the next. Subsequent arcs stuck to the same formula but did not reach the heights of the first arc but were good none the less. Also the pacing can be quite slow at some points and is definitely off-putting.  Overall the story was enjoyable to watch and is very good at points but is nothing tremendously special.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 9\\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation really knows their strengths when it comes to animation. Get a bunch of cute girls, give them eyes the size of half of their face to make them cuter and Walla we have ourselves a money making machine. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway back to the animation. The quality, as per usual, is very high and remains in accordance with the high production values of Kyoto Ani. The characters movements are fluid and the colours and backgrounds are vivid and bright. The character details are great but it is the character designs themselves which is the thing I have a problem with. This is due to there being three characters with a different shade of purple differing them and another 2 characters having slightly different facial features that differ between them. This is more a problem due to source material rather than the animators themselves but come on you can do better Kyoto Ani.\\n\\n\r\nSo they did. All throughout Clannad there are scenes from a different dimension. These scenes are some of the best that I have ever seen. They were beautifully executed; the character movements were almost life like, the detail put into each scene is extraordinary and the ambient lighting always fits the mood exquisitely. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 7.35 (Soundtrack-8.7 and Voice Acting-6.2)\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in this anime will have you reminiscing about the scenes that certain tracks accompany. The tracks are very well composed and match the scenes, moods and atmosphere exquisitely. Also the ending is very cute and catchy and plays a major role in After Story. The gripes I have with this soundtrack is that, for all the very good pieces there are, there is no piece that I have found to be special. \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the few anime that I have watched in both English Dub and the original Japanese. Overall I cannot comment on the Japanese as I do not understand the language (unfortunately) but I can feel the emotion which is put into the voices of each character. \\n\\n\r\nThe English Dub, on the other hand, is an entirely different matter on its own.  When I watched the first episode of the English Dub I felt that it was quite a jarring experience. However, by the end of episode 3 I had become accustomed to English voices and by episode 7 I had become reasonably attached to them. The quality of acting throughout was good and I felt the emotion pouring through the characters.In particular praise should be given to David Matranga and Andrew Love who voiced Tomoya and Akio respectively. It was mainly due to the way in which these two characters were portrayed that I liked them so much. However even with the quality of the voices the script produced for this anime was far inferior to the original Japanese Dub.  On the whole it was only a couple of voices that irked me but nothing major and it was quite enjoyable to listen to, albeit with some shoddy writing at times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 7.5\\n\\n\r\nThis is the main driving force behind Clannad and if this had failed the whole anime would be worthless. Thankfully they did not fail and became the pillars that the series relies upon. All the characters fit into a stereotype and many fit into one, *cough* moe *cough*, but all of them undergo character development to some extent. It is the attention to detail that I like watching in this anime as no one character is ignored. Each character, apart from Ryou, has a depth and a personality about them which makes the viewing experience more enjoyable.This is especially present in Tomoya. His is a character which is similar to many other characters in anime but I feel that he stands out among the crowd for being eerily relate-able. My qualms come in the form of the main female lead Nagisa who I felt was kind of un-interesting in comparison with some of the other female characters such as Kyou, Kotomi and Tomoyo. But on the whole there is not a whole lot to complain about and the characters are nicely fleshed out and developed, albeit a little bland at times\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-6.6\\n\\n\r\nI did like the series as a whole and was an enjoyable experience but it was mainly the melodrama throughout the series which kept nagging at me and reduce the overall immersion that I had. At times it enthralled me but other times I found it to be quite boring and it was this inconsistency which drops my enjoyment down quite a lot. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 7.49\\n\\n\r\nThis is a very good anime on the whole, excelling in the animation and soundtrack elements and has some very good characters, albeit a bit bland at times. If you like a romantic anime with some slight harem influences then this will fit you fine however be warned that the anime is rather slow at points and does rely on some melodrama from time to time to try and stimulate your tear ducts.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said at the top none of this review takes into consideration any of the events of After Story.\\n\\n\r\nI hope that you found the review helpful and any feedback would be greatly appreciated =D\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review ever! :)\r\nClannad was something that made me change my views on normal slice of life animes in general. Although I do admit that watching the first few episodes did not change my mind (although rewatching them again after it was absolutely fantastic!). I do agree that it pales in comparison with After Story, but it is nonetheless great and tremendously better than your average slice of life anime or any normal anime even.\r\nStory - 9/10:\r\nThe story was great overall since it does not only brought about the depth of the characters but on how effective the way the stories weretold. You can have any normal story of how this girl becomes an orphan, or how this guy could not be the person that he wanted to be because he could not play the sport he wanted to because of a terrifying event - and all of this would still be obscure in its meaning if it wasn't told properly. Clannad does not have any problem with that. It brings about events and tells them so effectively that the viewer would easily get immersed with the plot easily.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10:\\n\r\nHere is where Clannad shines best. All characters are intriguing not because they are mysterious, because they're not (well not that much). They are however so complex in such a way that they are thoroughly human. Don't get me wrong we have Sonohara as this normal comic relief but even he has some depth in him and he shows it subtly. Though tsunderes supposedly are complex but have now become stereotypical, Kyou is different to me because precisely of Ryou, her sister. The dynamics between the two shows how these characters are quite different from standard anime stereotypes (though I am a bit disappointed that they do not have their arcs). Nagisa however, at first seems stereotypical but she would have her character development late in the season, where it is absolutely terrific (in my opinion of course). Then there is Tomoya, the delinquent, in which I think though is the most developed character in the course of season one. Other characters such as Fuko, Tomoyo, Sanae, Akio - all of them are also well written.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10:\\n\r\nI particularly do not like the sound much, since it is not very distinct with other animes but it is good nonetheless. It does not affect the anime, at least and provides a good way to fill the silence. The one thing I like however is the Big Dango Family song, which is really memorable and quite catchy.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10:\\n\r\nOf course, with Kyoto Animation's works you could only expect the best. Clannad here is no exception. The places, characters and facial expressions are all so well drawn and so beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nI did enjoy Clannad greatly. When I finished it, I know I will have to watch it again. I know that After Story is way better, which a lot of people do say. I even agree. But Clannad is great nonetheless. It made me smile, made me feel sad - within a single episode or within a single scene. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10:\\n\r\nClannad truly is a great anime. The reason why I gave it a 9, is how I think it did not utilize its full potential yet (which is of course, apparent in After Story). It already knows how to explore its characters but it lacks the great ending (good but not great, and of course in my humble opinion). Still, a great anime.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Recommendation: Clannad is not your typical slice of life anime. It boasts in a quality plot with an emphasis on the relationships between the characters. This never felt like a harem and has little to no fan service. There are many hilarious moments but equally as many tragic moments. A tissue box is also recommended. If you want a straight up slice of life that seems real, relatable and mature, this is for you. If you want a go happy on rails anime, this isn\u2019t your best choice but I\u2019m not stopping you.\r\nClannad\u2019s premise tells the tale of Tomoya Okazaki, a 3rd year student atHikarizaka Private High School. Despite being at the school for three years, he hasn\u2019t befriended much people and has earner the title of a delinquent, being late many times and skipping classes. His only friend is Youhei Sunohara, a fellow delinquent and class clown. One day on the way to school Tomoya met a girl (Nagisa Furukawa) at the bottom of the hill; speaking about how happy moments don\u2019t last. Whether this is a destined meeting or not, Tomoya\u2019s life is about to change.  A new transfer student aiming to become student president, a silent girl hidden amongst knowledge, a weird cherry girl with a starfish, and more embracing friendships with his current friends. Clannad primarily focuses of Tomoya\u2019s interactions with his friend, their relationship with him and his personal growth.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest strengths of the anime is its ability to tell a story, and boy what a story. The over-arching plot follows Tomoya and Nagisa\u2019s attempt to act out a play. The plot focuses on Tomoya\u2019s evolving relationship with Nagisa, and also on the other relationships between him and the other characters. The plot itself is very consistent with barley any plot holes and only minor problems with pacing. The story plays with emotions constantly and becomes a rollercoaster of emotions. This is the typical method Key adopts to keep players interested in the game and characters. The moment you meet a character it becomes light hearted and humorous then the next moment it gets serious and sometimes tragic. For the most part the anime keeps its humorous aspect and sometimes you question how after some heavy plot twist and you are still able to laugh off to some stupid action by Youhei. It somehow manages to still give you a laugh throughout the entire series it is the experiences that are shared between the characters that build on upon the plot and the overall theme. One of the biggest differences from previous Key adaptations is that Clannad is a much more mature story with more mature and complex characters. The tragedies that unfold are indeed mature, and for that I think it is a much better plot. The mature themes further develop a much deeper story and this too creates a more relatable experience and a highlighted personal response.  It does at times get inspirational since many of these problems are relatable. I guess since it tackles more mature themes, such as death and self-blame, it becomes a much better anime for it. It\u2019s just that there is so much that makes the characters human and the interactions between them much more interesting and real.\t\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is split up into multiple arcs, which primarily focuses on one specific character. The arc builds up the characters, indulging in the backstory of the character and their evolving relationship with Tomoya. There have been a few consistencies with the arc lengths, some only lasting a measly few episodes and one lasting about seven. Of course pacing should be an issue when adapting a visual novel, since there is so much to cover within a limited frame, but Kyoto Animation- Kyoani for short- has done a good job trying to pace well. Though there are those small issues with the arc lengths, since the shorter arcs mean less development for that character and their importance to the overall plot may seem misplaced.  The anime may have a somewhat slower start in its first arc but it is just as effective as the other arcs. Each arc places much empathises on each of the main characters whom play a big role in the overall plot of helping Nagisa in performing her play. \\n\\n\r\nWith the relationships being so important, having distinct and interesting character is a must need. Character development is one of the story\u2019s most important aspects. Thankfully, all the characters are unique and have characteristics of all shapes and sizes. Tomoya himself is not the usual delinquent, usually speaks in a somewhat sarcastic tone to make a mockery of others for his own benefit. His daily monologues are enjoyable and bring out a witty and hilarious tone to the serious. Despite all this, Tomoya still acts in a very mature way and still has well intentions to try and help people, but usually in his own way. This all contrasts with Nagisa\u2019s personality, which is as pure as it can be. She in fact loves the dango daikazoku (big dumpling family) which aired in the past as a happy and cute family. She likes to hold old fashion values such as the strong relationship between the family members, which leads ultimately to happiness. She is usually seen as a weak minded person, usually being gullible to Tomoya\u2019s antics and ploys. But, there are many times throughout the series that shows her personality growing as she eventually gets closer to Tomoya. But as with Tomoya, she likes to help others, but usually right until the end in a more moral and understanding nature. This contrast between the two characters creates some interesting chemistry and plentiful interesting situations. Not only is their relationship important, but it affects both of them in major ways. Well get to see Tomoya grow from an ignorant child who cares for himself towards a more grown and mature person, all thanks to Nagisa. Their relationship affects each other quite a lot over time, showing their growth is something we all like to see and believe. \\n\\n\r\nAll the other characters are just memorable, and to say so myself, quite attractive. Not in the sense of physical beauty, but their personalities are attractive. Well, I guess their looks are also attractive. The cast is filled with many personalities; from a cute small girl with a starfish that is arrogant to a cool and calm girl, with womanly qualities and is strong both physically and mentally. It really helps when we learn much about their backstory during their specific arc. Since it was adapted from a visual novel, where possibly every girl you meet can become a potential partner, each character in the anime would go so well with Tomoya. Since the story is told from his view, we get to know what he thinks, what he feels and essentially live as he does. I will not go into further detail with the characters but they are so relatable, which makes us get somewhat emotional. It would be wrong if you didn\u2019t finish the anime without a new favourite character. Whether it\u2019s the lovable Fuko, cool and calm Tomoyo, smart and shy Kotomi, the ever so tsundere Kyou or the imouto Mei. Nagisa\u2019s parents too, get a mention since they are so kind and rather cool. Sanae Furukawa, the mother, is an innocent mother who bakes bread for their business and usually runs away crying due to her bread skills being rather bad. Though, she is super supportive for Nagisa and Tomoya\u2019s relationship. Akio Furukawa is father everyone wants. He is funny, cool and overall awesome. But his most highlighting trait is being a father. He does get serious when protecting his daughter and takes extreme measures to make sure she is happy. From hiding skeletons in the closet (figuratively) to openly supporting her in the time of need, Akio is one great and loving father.\\n\\n\r\nA major emphasis of the plot is placed on relationships, and this focus of building relationships allows us to connect and relate to the characters, to feel what they feel and mimic what they do. The main relationship is between Nagisa and Tomoya, and through that we can see and understand their past experiences through their interactions. Many past experiences are rather tragic but in time have a content outcome with the help of Tomoya and Nagisa. Another relationship that is profound and relative is between Tomoya and his father. This is quite a common relationship in the real world, a distant relationship where they won\u2019t even acknowledge each other despite living in the same house. Of course, this affected the both of them in many ways but as I said before this is common in the real world. Tomoya and Youhei have a friendly relationship between each other but Tomoya usually takes the mickey out of Youhei just for fun. With the other main girls, the relationship is at its peak tension during their arcs, since it is primarily focused between Tomoya and that character. But due to the nature that the anime must follow one route, the romance between those characters and Tomoya is never explored. Nor does it need to, since there is a sense of relief and completion to know that their troubles have been solved.  Previous Key adaptations by Kyoani have been done in a somewhat immature way, when compared to this, and the relationship factor isn\u2019t as strong. It also doesn\u2019t help how many magical elements play a major role in their story. Not to say that there isn\u2019t any magic at work in Clannad, since the Illusionary World is a prominent reoccurring idea. This Illusionary World appears every now and again and features a small robot and a little girl (the only human) living in a sad world. This is the play that Nagisa acts out in the end. How she knows the story of the Illusionary World is a mystery, and so is the Illusionary World itself. Not much is revealed about this world and how it ties into the story, but it\u2019s there\u2026 I guess. It is a somewhat desolate place that adds another tragic theme to the story. Of course if you do want answers, watching the next series Clannad After Story is what you want. \\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation have been known for some top notch animation. Nothing that can be defined as the best, but they have done some really solid visual representations. Though, all the character designs are based on the visual novel they are done very well and with good taste too. The characters have distinct features that differentiate themselves from each other, and this is before the big moe character explosion. Fan service is pretty much non-existence since it serves no purpose (like it ever did) especially in this relationship based anime.  The usage of colours is apparent throughout the series; even in the beginning of the first episode a large colour contrast between Tomoya\u2019s inner monologue about his hatred towards the town, and his first interaction with Nagisa. The screen goes from a monochrome purple to flashes of bright colours where they\u2019re surrounded by Sakura trees. The entire anime likes to show sakura trees in general. So, colour plays an important part in the story and also in the Illusionary World where things seem desolate and dull. The backgrounds are all done well and the animation seems rather smooth and fluid.\\n\\n\r\nThe original visual novel doesn\u2019t have any voice acting so finding the right voice actors/seiyuus is vital to express the correct emotions and gestures. Kyoani has done a magnificent job in finding the correct people and the voices are all done with full effect. The entire cast does a great effort and may even give shivers in the right situation. The cast contains some pretty well known seiyuus such as Mai Nakahara (Working!) and Yuuichi Nakamura (Ore no Imouto). They all convey their characters effectively and have no annoying voices that pierce your back.\\n\\n\r\nOne of Key\u2019s biggest strength in their visual novels is their music. Composed by Jun Maeda, all composed tracks and songs are so brilliantly well done. The anime takes all the tracks from the visual novel\u2019s soundtrack and apply them wonderfully in scenes. From the simple yet elegant tune of Nagisa\u2019s theme to the sorrow and complex theme of the Illusionary World; Illusions, it is without a doubt that the music further enhances the emotive scenes throughout the series, playing at the right time complementing the scene\u2019s portrayal. The songs are well memorable and so are the scenes that play with them. Even when searching through YouTube for a particular track, all the memories, the actions and emotions come rushing back. That is the effect the music has on you, it is just that amazing. Most of the soundtrack is composed of melodies only, and is usually played on the piano but some of the more complex pieces are more orchestral in a sense. To me, the opening credits of the anime aren\u2019t anything too spectacular. I guess I get turned off by the song but the video itself is well done and has some foreshadowing. The opening isn\u2019t too memorable, but what is, is the ending credits. Dango Daikazoku. This song follows the Nagisa theme and has a vocal track over it. It is deemed as the official song of the anime, since in the background are the cute Dango dumplings hopping around. The ending may seem so innocent and cute, with a very catchy rhythm and rather cute lyrics, but since many tragic scenes are played towards the end of episodes (as cliffhangers); the song recalls all those sad moments and essentially the entire experience of watching Clannad for the first time.  The ending song now will recall all the memories once you finish, that simple tune will give you shivers and all these feels.\\n\\n\r\nClannad isn\u2019t your typical slice of life anime. It focuses on what is important in any good media, plot. The character development and the relationships are done very well that not only do they grow on you and you grow on them\u2026 somehow. The plot may have some arc length issues and maybe a couple pacing problems but the overall plot package is so well done that negligible damage is dealt. The anime visually looks pleasing, as most Kyoani anime production do. The anime has some of the best tracks around, all thanks to Jun Maeda\u2019s wonderful composing abilities. The songs are unforgettable and show a ton of emotions that is experienced throughout the series. You get very attached to the characters and it is sad to see them go once you finish the anime. But then again, there is Clannad After Story.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: Clannad is an amazing piece of anime, with some amazing characters, character development, mature themes and an outstanding soundtrack. There are a couple minor issues with the arc pacing but is just very minor. This anime is for anyone who wants to have a wild emotive ride, that resonates with real life and see how inspirational and emotional you can get. Slice of life fans will indeed enjoy this, and I do recommend any otaku to watch this. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you want this review summed up horribly into a scoring system (which I don\u2019t like)\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n",

            "content": "Clannad was surprising on my first watch, before I had seen it I expected a typical Harem, Visual Novel adaptation. What I got in the end was something very different.\r\n==STORY==\r\nThe story plays out how you would expect a VN adaptation to. We basically follow Tomoya Okazaki as he interacts with the female cast through different story arcs, helping them with their problems. Some arcs are far better than others, and vary in length but do well to keep the focus on to 1 girl at a time. Throughout these Clannad offers a host of different things for different types of viewers. A fair amount ofhumour, quite a lot of fanservice, some is just blatant, but mostly subtle (some attire choices and close up shots I noticed were indeed intentionally there to appeal to the audience watching Clannad for its Harem elements), and contains a lot of fantasy related themes. Clannad is also very heavy on drama which carries it at most points, and even the occasional action scenes.\\n\\n\r\n==CHARACTERS==\\n\r\nClannad offers a healthy variety of likeable characters, they consist of many different personalities, but some characters being far more interesting than others. One of the problems I had was with the main character Tomoya, the self-proclaimed 'deliquent.' There is the problem already, Tomoya is no deliquent, actually he is probably one of the friendliest protagonists you'll see, often helping out people for no particular reason, despite having a troubled past, and a horrible relationship with his father, overall I found his character often monotonous. But it is his interactions with the girls which remain key throughout the series. I feel Tomoya's friend Youhei at times offers more intriguing moments and at some points kept me watching.\\n\\n\r\n==ART & ANIMATION==\\n\r\nIt's hard to put into words how spectacular the art is in Clannad but then again I'd expect no less from KyoAni. The female characters never fail to be mo\u00e9, Nagisa in particular as her character has a naivity that accompanies her design. If you do notice the backgrounds (which you most likely wont considering the characters often stand out) they provide mostly the colours of greys, beiges and browns which are often known for being particularly dull, however in this case, they manage to give those colours a shine that brightens up the background as a whole. The addition of fallen Cherry Blossoms near Cherry Blossom Trees and on roads in outside settings is a nice touch. Animation is less to be talked about, since most episodes are the characters, sitting, standing or walking not much about animations needs mention, when animations occasionally become more complex (referring to Tomoyo's 200 hit combo, among others) it delivers flawlessly.\\n\\n\r\n==SOUND==\\n\r\nThe OP in Clannad is nice and very fantasy-like. The ED IS catchy, at first it'll seem like a Japanese nursery rhyme, but hear it enough times and you'll be singing along to it. Background music is often a solo piano score to fit romantic or sad moments which is pulled off well, but other than that, background songs aren't anything noteworthy. And seiyu's do well to sound as cute, youthful and as energetic as their character may be, but I can't judge the voice acting properly since I don't speak Japanese.\\n\\n\r\n==CONCLUSION==\\n\r\nI've given Clannad a fair amount of praise so you are probably wondering why didn't it get a higher score? And here it is, not enough happens in Clannad, it will often be a series of tiring conversation and boring/mindless activity, one after the other. And it is this activity such as, handing out stars, playing random sports, designing posters that left me often dissatisfied. More so when the story as a whole tends to drag on through some parts. At times I wanted to get the episode over and done with. I did intend to give Clannad a lower score but when noticing the overall quality of Clannad I could never give this a true low score. I just feel Clannad is not enjoyable enough, everything is done OK, from story to character development but satisfaction is not usually present. Despite this Clannad can appeal to a wide audience and is one of the most universal animes you'll probably see.",

            "content": "If anime as a whole were to hold an Olympic-type gathering of all the genres that make up \"anime\", I would want \"Clannad\" to be the representative for the romance genre. \r\n\"Clannad\" is probably the most highly-touted love series in anime today. Its sequel, \"After Story\", holds the number one slot on this site in terms of overall rating (Avg. overall score of nine). The prequel, in my opinion, isn't, and should not be far behind whatsoever. \"Clannad\" is a solid, fantastic piece of romance, that has lived up to my high expectations, and surpassed them. It's a series that has something for everybody: love,fantasy, slice-of-life, school, cuteness, harem, etc.\\n\\n\r\nAlbeit, with that glowing introduction, I had a really tough time enjoying \"Clannad\" when it first began. This stint of boredom lasted for about the first five episodes, then quickly disappeared and was made non-existent. Encompassing those first five episodes or so was the \"Fuko-arc\". This being a love anime that has many important (girl) characters that pertain to the pacing and depth of the plot, you're going to get a side-story on each important one. I guess it's just my bad luck that they started out with, in my opinion, a boring, shallow, and redundant plot to portray a character that rarely, and I mean RARELY, shows up in the future episodes (mainly as comedic relief).\\n\\n\r\nBut, like I said, from then on, the show got great. Really great. \\n\r\nNow, I thought this show, from looking at the introduction to this story, that it was going to be a weeper. How mistkan, and thankfully so, I was. This series had me laughing more than the over-glorified-as-a-comedy \"Seto no Hanayome\". However, for all the serious types out there, don't worry, you've got your themes that act as allegories for the characters that are being showcased; some very sad moments; and morally-questioning and pull-at-your-heat-strings-moments aplenty. Unlike most romance animes, this one really seems to have a consistent arc of the theater that underscores each encounter and drives the story forward at a pace that's just right. \\n\r\n9/10 - If only they had taken those first five episodes out....\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really the highlight here. The \"dreamscapes\" are nothing short of breathtaking and the \"everyday animation\" is definitely above average. What denotes such a high score is 110% attributed to the alternate reality that's fully-saturated with themes, symbols, and motifs. Even though the animation outside of the dreamscapes are alright, you cannot overlook the amount of attention to detail, workmanship, and care went into producing those scenes. \\n\\n\r\nMy only gripe about the art is that the characters initially (especially Sanae and Nagisa) resembled aliens. Their hair and eyes kind of threw me for a loop, but it eventually becomes irrelevant and, like Fuko, you forget you even had the thought in the first place.\\n\r\n10/10 - The dreamscape animation was better than some feature-length anime films.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed the sound here. The script was well put together, the funny bits were surprisingly funny, the story was well-written, and each voice actor or actress was voiced very well. I really have no complaints.\\n\r\n10/10 - You'll find a surprising amount of clever, comedic lines hidden throughout \"Clannad\".\\n\\n\r\nI could write a 10-page paper on the characters in \"Clannad\" without mentioning everything. With that being said, I'll keep this brief. \\n\\n\r\nEach character is represented as a viable \"candidate\" for Tomoya's partner, and you're left satisfied and intrigued at each character's side-story as to how they became the way they are. It can come across as a harem-like, which I would say to you: \"Yes. Yes it is.\" This is a harem anime in disguise. Poorly hidden, maybe, but fun for everyone, and never acts as a deterrent to the enjoyment of the anime. I, personally, gravitated more to another girl than the one he ultimately ended up choosing, but I really don't care. Too many times have I come across romance animes where it's left wide-open for you to interpret. Here, they give each girl valuable time and opportunity, and end up with a clear victor. The girls that are left unchosen even audibly concede defeat, discretely so, to the girl who has one Tomoya's heart. It's surprising at the blatancy and audacity of the creators, but its uniqueness comes across in a pleasantly blunt manner that doesn't dissuade the viewer who hadn't picked the girl that Tomoya had chosen to lose complete interest.\\n\r\n10/10 - I'm usually not a fan of giving each character a mini-arc or side-story, but \"Clannad\" definitely threw me a curveball that I thoroughly enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is really the lovechild of (almost) every sub-genre of romance anime out there. And who knew it wouldn't make such a mundane color like brown, but instead, (my favorite color) green.\\n\r\n\"Clannad\" is definitely a series that's a strong contender for my favorite romance anime that I've seen so far. Knowing that there's a movie and true sequel, I can't wait for it to compete.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 - I wish I had stumbled across it sooner!\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 - Deep when need be; funny when it was appropriate; but always spectacular.",

            "content": "Well, I've been surprised again.\r\nA pity it was in a negative way this time. Due to the enormous repercussion Clannad has I thought I would give it a chance, since so many people said it was beautiful, tear-jerking, sad, etc. \r\nDrama my arse.\r\nClannad is drama as much as Naruto is.\r\nYeah, you read it right. I'd dare say that Naruto might even be more successful on its attempts to drama than Clannad was. I was utterly disappointed by how lame the attempts to pull tears out of your eyes in this series are.\r\nThe producers relied so much on (poor) humor, that every time where you hada \"dramatic\" moment it ended up coming across as exaggerated or unnatural.\\n\\n\r\nEven more unnatural are the attempts to a supernatural approach. They just don't fit, sound forced and nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nClannad might have been a lot more enjoyable if it was reduced to 12 episodes only. There were at least 7 complete unnecessary episodes, and several other ones that could have been reduced to half of what they are. Not only does this dramatically decreases the pace of the series but it also gives the show an overall feeling of lack of creativity since the episodes just drag on lame jokes and useless dialogues.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are really shallow, extremely stereotyped and hard to connect with. They overreact or act unnaturally on almost every conflict that they face. Nagisa's constant promptness to tears drove me crazy. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Kyoto Animation did a good job on Air and Kanon (2006) it's hard to understand what they were trying to do in Clannad. There was an attempt on focusing on family relationships, but even this is extremely poorly done.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very repetitive, the art has nothing original to it and quite often I felt annoyed by the voice of some characters (Nagisa being the most annoying of'em all).\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, it's really difficult to me to understand the hype behind some animes. I'll give a chance to Clannad ~after story~. Since my expectations are so low I might as well be surprised positively this time.",

            "content": "The third Key adaptation by Kyoto Animation, Clannad. Once again we are reminded of how great these 2 names go together, after giving us Air, and Kanon 2006, Clannad is a really good romance/drama anime that should not be missed by fans of either of the 2 previous shows.\r\nStory: This time around our main male protagonist is Okazaki Tomoya, a high school student with a not so enjoyable past. Throughout the story he will meet the 5 main girl protagonists. Just like Kanon was done, after using the first 4-5 episodes to introduce us to the vast amount of characters in this show a setamount of episodes were designated to completing the arcs of each of the main girls. Now as far as the actual story goes, Clannad is definitely the more comedic one of the 3, there are lots of laughs to be had in this show and as the arcs reach a conclusion Kyoto turns on their famous &quot;tears&quot; mode done so many times before with Air and Kanon and give us scenes that will prob make you cry. I did find that as the show was reaching the final episode the content was going to get rushed, Clannad is way bigger than Kanon and Air were in amount of story so trying to fit it all in 24 episodes was going to be a challenge (yes im including the OVA ep 24). A good example of trying to rush things is shown with 2 of the arcs, they are merged together and then in 1 swift move they are brought to a cold hard stop and conclusion...unfortunately this was done using my 2 fav characters so it really really hurt me :(\\n\\n\r\nArt: By now it is almost fact that Kyoto = amazing animation. This show is no different. The characters look gorgeous, there is barely any scene in the entire show that looks sloppy, the colours are bright and overall this show is great eye candy. 10/10 is almost a default score here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: As massive as the soundtrack for Clannad is, it is not my favourite. None of the songs really catch my attention but that does not mean that the show sounds bad, in fact its great! The background songs really reflect the atmosphere and they are effectively used to create tear jerking moments or comedic gold moments when needed. The voice actors did a great job too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is IMO the best aspect of Clannad. The characters of Clannad are so varied that you can barely see 2 characters with a similar attitude.  Our hero Tomoya is a kind hearted person on the inside but he loves playing pranks on people specially his best &quot;friend&quot; Sunohara. Speaking of Sunohara, he is prob one of the most unfortunate persons I've ever seen, almost every scene with him is guaranteed to become comedy gold, but also he can get into some very serious situations. The main girls of Clannad are Nagisa, she is the shy, helpless, no self-steem girl and also the main female protagonist (meh i dont really like her :p). Kotomi is a genius girl that is very naive about real life situations and is bad at socializing with others and making friends. Fuko is the small, weird, girl that does and say things that not anyone would do. Tomoyo is one of the best ones IMO she is a gentle and caring girl but at the same time is able to beat up anyone in school if provoked, teamed with sunohara she gives some great moments. And last we have Kyou Fujibayashi (my fav :P), she is the hot blooded, quick to act tsundere girl or Clannad, and she will protect her younger twin sister Ryou at all costs. If you have seen Lucky Star you would see the extreme resemblance between them and Tsukasa &amp; Kagami lol). More interesting characters to mention are Akio and Sanae, which are Nagisa's parents, Akio is possibly the greatest anime dad in existence lol he likes to say things before thinking of who is around, which mostly end in Sanae crying and running away while he gives chase. Wow i've written so much about the characters, and there are even more i havent mentioned, this is why Clannad has IMO the best characters from all 3 shows.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I would be lying if I told you I didnt enjoy Clannad, its one of the best shows out there right now. But I was somewhat disappointed at how Tomoyo and Kyou's arcs were treated in the anime. It hurt the score I was planning on giving this show. No more 9.5/10, but you get a nice 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nOverall Clannad once again demonstrates that when you put Kyoto and Key together you are bound to get some great anime, with great story and great animation. Its also good to hear that the After Story will be animated because without it Clannad is just not complete...in KyoAni/Key we trust.",

            "content": "(This will be a spoiler-free review but I will refer to certain characters)\r\nPlease refer to the main Clannad page for a plot description. I'll just write my positives and negatives for the series here.\r\nPositives:\r\n- The comedy in Clannad was one of the best things about it for me, especially any Sunohara scene and also anything involving Akio Furukawa (particularly the scenes with his wife). I was only disappointed there wasn't more of it, I think Sunohara could've had his own show :P\r\n- The episodes that focus mainly on the theatre club were interesting and felt as if they were going somewhere; although again for methere wasn't enough focus on this in the series\\n\\n\r\n- The music was good, especially the ending song. However, one piece of music gets repeatedly played whenever something remotely sad or depressing happens, so for me it lost its impact and instead became a signal that something melodramatic was about to be shoehorned into the episode. That got tiresome...\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\n- Personal choice, but I really didn't like the character designs of the female characters. The way their eyes were drawn just made them look a bit soulless so it was difficult to take any sort of 'emotional scene' seriously\\n\\n\r\n- Speaking of 'emotional scenes,' the melodrama in this was about as subtle as a wrecking ball. I enjoy drama but Clannad just became more and more ridiculous as it turned into a competition of 'Which girl can have the most disastrous back story that has nothing to do with what's going on, doesn't progress the story and will be forgotten about in the course of the next few episodes??' \\n\r\nIt just became silly and made it quite difficult for me to keep wanting to watch. The Kotomi and Fuko arcs are especially guilty of this. \\n\\n\r\n- Fuko-chan. Bloody Fuko-chan. So very very annoying. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nAs you can probably tell from my score I didn't really enjoy this :P It had potential with the comedy and theatre club angle but just got lost in a sea of impossible-situation-overdramatic-ness. I think it could've been done far better.\\n\r\nThough from what I've heard, if you have enjoyed other series from Key such as Kanon and Air then you'll probably like this.\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n",

            "content": "How to write a negative review without sounding like you hate the show?\r\nFirstly, let me confess I've been trying my absolute best to like this show, mostly because I had heard a lot of good things about it. I have yet to finish watching it as I am pretty stubborn and I like to believe I watched all there was before making final statements.\r\nBut I just can't forgive Clannad for being this poor for more than half of first season. I will explain why.\r\nCOnsidering the tags and people's reviews, I was expecting a peaceful slice of life show, with a tiny bit of everything init, enough to make it interesting. When I started watching it I was instantly bothered by a couple of things that didn't improve in any way later on.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design: \\n\\n\r\nThis show is all about cuteness when it comes to visuals, voice acting and music.The characters look very very little with those too big wet eyes supposedly to make a big emotional/expressive impact I suppose. Truth is that most of the time I am looking at their sharp bangs and praying they won't cut open their eyeballs. Apart from being cute, it becomes a real issue if absolutely all female characters have this problem, meaning that all of them look exactly the same. It's like the character designer didn't really put in any effort to add some personal touch to the characters.\\n\\n\r\n It goes a lot further than this. Being introduced to Nagisa's house for the first time and knowing this show must have had some \"fantasy\" elements in it too, I was 100% sure that her house was some weird place where more Nagisas live in somwhat different dimensions or something. I know, I am a creep. But her entire family appeared one by one and they ALL looked like her so I was thinking \"omg she just turned male!\" (about her dad) then \"omg this is her in 5 years from now\" (her mom) and it took me a while to figure out that they were all actually real people, different people. The age is also not reflected at all. Her father looks like he's 17-19. There's a wedding somwhere and the groom looks 15 I had a very weird sense that someone was just being too much of a perv drawing that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and  development:\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, this show is about cute and moe characters. But I would expect everything to have a limit. Besides the intoxicating appearance, the actual characters, at least when it comes to female cast, are completely pathetic. Fo even mere students who go to school and are overall bad with study, it is beyond impossible to be that clumsy and unaware of yourself and the things around you. Sadly enough, I just had an acute feeling of shame while watching some of the scenes where the girls were proving how they don't know their own basic abilities, they don't hear while they are called by their name even though tehre's nobody else in the room, they don't know a wound actually hurts (even after the third try that proved an open cut does indeed hurt), they don't know how to communicate with anybody at all and somehow nobody finds that unusual and generally... they just don't know anything at all.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is even worse is generally the way in which women are presented in this show. Even the ones who don't suffer from chronic autism and shyness, are simply the kind of \"i want a simple life to please my husband and that's the greatest pleasure there is\". I'm not a feminist or anything, but things that are too obvious like this are really hard not to notice. Of course I can explain this issue by pointing at the name of the show, which clearly makes a reference to the family. And being a Japanese show about family, of course you expect their traditional values to be projected into anime stereotypes. But even if this is an explanation, it is merely an excuse for not having strong female characters.\\n\\n\r\nNagisa, which is supposed to be the main female cast is merely a shadow, at least in the first half. I can't point out at any of her character details because there is none other that that she cries a lot and is physically fragile, so overall the personification of fragility.\\n\\n\r\nPlot/story/arcs\\n\\n\r\nI am still not sure what this show is about and my expectations out of anime are really quite low. As long as the show feeds me with stuff to think and interpret at my own will, I am happy. But this is not the case. There is just one thing probably highlighted again and again in a repetitive way: we are not alone and we can make friends everywhere. \\n\\n\r\nI was expecting to see some conflicts because this was a drama show. I am in for tear jerking shows even if they are cheap in the end if you have a good time it's okay. Instead I just have the feeling that this show tries too much to make me cry therefore the word \"pathetic\" is a good choice. I can think of a dramatic emotional moment regarding Tomoya's hand. because it was a nice scenery and the dramatic detail came in time, taking the viewer by surprise, synchronizing with the weather, with the tension between the 2 characters... etc. It was good in that \"good\" way that Clannad is probably intended to be. But it was just that one, insignificant, after which I had to enjoy a neverending arc about a very absurd thing. Since I'm trying not to throw in with any spoils, I'll just say it was, again, pathetic. The idea behind it was great, but again the highlighted details that were going on for 5 episodes or so where just mere fillers I can't help but think anyone could have came up with something more valuable. The basic story was sad okay, but the way they just stretched it for those long huours I couldn't focus on the boring meaningless dialogues, I was sleepy, annoyed and bored. And I was really feeling like I was wasting precious time of my life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  Show tries too much to make you cry lol. And it's all too forced and too unnatural: cute crying helpless characters and wooden stars are not enough.\\n\\n\r\nWill continue watching this and updating my review as I finish. The reason is also that I really want to get to the second season, heard that one is worth suffering :))\\n\\n",

            "content": "Considering that I am a fan of both romance and slice of life anime I went into Clannad with high hopes as it is one of the most highly praised series in its genre. \r\nHowever I left utterly disappointed by this show. \r\nPart of what makes a good romance story is it's characters. I am usually willing to overlook plot holes (or really a lack of plot altogether) as long as the characters are interesting. So when it comes to a slice of life based on average people and their average lives the characters are usually the main driving force of the show. \r\nAnd sadlyit just so happens that the characters are my biggest gripe with Clannad. I don't have anything against Moe or cuteness, in fact I actually quite enjoy it. The problem arises when you realize that each of Clannad's characters exists for a specific purpose (relative to each other) and only ever act to fulfill that purpose. This means that throughout the show the characters stay one dimensional (read no character development). Not only that but they also become extremely predicable within the first few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist exists solely to fix the girls' problems and reluctantly put up with their antics. He continues to voice his discontent with them but they somehow always remain oblivious to his insults. The male support lead exists solely to get his ass kicked. He continues to endure verbal and physical harassment from the female cast day in and out as if he enjoys it. It gets to the point where the same bit is used in almost every episode. First he says something slightly insulting and then is kicked across the room, only to be subsequently laughed at. And its not as if Clannad's blatant sexism ends there either. The main female cast is ultra feminine to a point beyond anything realistic. They act like children a 1/4 of their age despite being highschool students. They posses no other character traits other than ultra-cuteness, or ultra-kindness (but never both). Other than having different hobbies they are all practically the same, even their character designs being similar!\\n\\n\r\nThe truth is the characters are hard to believe and even harder to like. If that wasn't bad enough Clannad has no real story to be found. The plot line is dependent on the uninteresting aspirations of the main cast (such as becoming student council president, convincing the student body to attend a wedding, etc).\\n\\n\r\nSaying it blatantly, Clannad is boring. Although I found myself wanting to sympathize with the characters I couldn't outside a few albeit fleeing moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is the only thing Clannad has going for it. The show is devoid of meaning or realism, giving it little value outside the enjoyment factor. And because the characters act so predictably I found it hard to enjoy this anime at all. A joke is funny once, or maybe even the first few times it's used, however after that it becomes a burden. And sadly, that is what I felt while watching Clannad, burdened.",

            "content": "I had high expectations for this series, someone told me to watch it and I eventually got to it. \r\nStory: I'll break it down into the different arcs in order.\r\nFuuko - I hated this. I wanted to drop the series because it dragged on way too long. 9 episodes? C'mon, that's almost half the series if you don't count the supplementary episode(s). Fuuko was cute and all but the same thing happened every episode, it got so bad... Had I known this from the beginning I'd have skipped the middle of this arc and skipped to the conclusion. A problem I and many others hadwith this arc was that  other characters were rushed or weren't developed enough due to the length of this awful section of the series.\\n\\n\r\nKotomi - This is where the series got a lot better, exactly what I was expecting. This part of the series had many memorable moments and was written pretty well. Each episode had a cliffhanger making me want more. I was relieved to see this follow the Fuuko arc and thought the conclusion was fine.\\n\\n\r\nTomoyo - She didn't really get anything. In terms of her character, you kind of wanted more of her and she was pretty interesting but nope. For what she got, it wasn't bad. There was a nice cliffhanger within her two or so episodes. The conclusion was a bit lacking but things seemed to have worked out for her.\\n\\n\r\nNagisa - This was done well too. I had no complaints, I could watch through each episode with no problems and each episode was enjoyable. The drama really picks up here and it was a very satisfying arc.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It didn't get a 10 because it didn't seem like Kyoto Animation worked as hard on this series as they did with the others. It still looked pretty nice compared to other shows so it gets a 9.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Sigh... the opening was really really bad. The ending here wasn't a bad song it's just not something I'd add to a song list. I just did not care for them. Considering this series is more of a comedy (And I use the term very lightly) than a drama, I felt one upbeat song would've been more proper. None of the bgm was very good, none of it stood out. As for voice acting, no problems with the actors. Didn't really hate any of them and the voices fit well. Although Fuuko got annoying quick.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: A few characters made a good impression on me. Most of the rest were probably not explored enough so I didn't really have much to say about them. \\n\\n\r\nI liked the way Tomoya pulled pranks on Fuuko, it made her arc less stupid. More than that though he seemed to develop well as the story progressed. He started to mature a bit and interacting with the others made him change for the better. Still lacking a bit as the lead character but there is a second season...\\n\\n\r\nKotomi wasn't a bad character. It's just that when Kotomi's arc was over, she was just there. It's true that I wouldn't know what to do with her character either but she played no part in the rest of the series. She was given an offer to study abroad and I thought she should've left right there since she took the offer later anyway.\\n\\n\r\nTomoyo just did not get that much. What I mean is that her episodes were good but I just felt something was lacking. It struck me as odd when her character makes a shift of personality just out of nowhere. When she was introduced in the Fuuko arc she was reused for the same thing over and over giving birth to a commonly used gif. Her general character at the beginning was not too talkative to others. Then again, it's Sunohara who approaches her most of the time. Then later, she acts more social and friendly towards Tomoya out of the blue. I liked her change but it was so out of place that I have mixed feelings. She is a character I have respect for and I'm glad she got that Ova.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't care for Kyou and Ryou because of how they were handled in the series. There wasn't really anything for me to pick up from these characters. They should've gotten their own arc but they were just splashed into certain episodes so they didn't get much development, I blame Fuuko. \\n\\n\r\nI definitely liked Nagisa's parents. They were a joy to watch and were very funny. Wanted to see more of Yukine but I guess she was just there for the characters to talk to. Perhaps she and other side characters will be addressed in the second season. The rest of the characters I didn't mention I don't hate but they weren't great or they just did not stand out to me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I almost gave it a 6, but rethought it. Like I said the Fuuko arc was dragged out garbage but the rest of the series saved it. Another problem was how hard they tried to make the series funny. Like I said Tomoya's pranks are pretty funny and so are Nagisa's parents but many times you can tell when they want you to think something's funny when it clearly isn't. That bothered me a bit. Not to mention, they repeat certain jokes which get less funny and just lame to watch. I liked the morals of this series which is having a family in your friends. Seems to me this series is a little overhyped probably because of the success of Kanon which I thought was amazing (After the dragged out arc of that series) As for re-watch value, I would not watch the entire series again, just certain scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It was good. Can't say it would become a personal favorite but I'd kind of recommend it to others. There are other series I'd recommend first but I'd get around to telling people about this.

            "content": "One way to put my confusion about Clannad is that it's either the most cynical, or pure-hearted anime I can ever remember seeing, and I have equally reacted to both of these ways of viewing it, like going back and forth between the duck and the rabbit in the famous optical illusion. \"Clannad\" apparently means family in Irish, which according to the show seems to be what ultimately makes life great, but the main character's \"clannad\" consists of a bunch of girls who are all in love with him and a friend that's mostly there so the girls actually have a choice. And they donot choose him, rather he is the target of most of the show's jokes. Ironically, considering the main theme, the only social depiction even close to being realistic is the one of the relationship between the main character and his drunkard father who once hurt him so gravely that he can't lift his arm over his shoulder anymore, which fits so badly in with the rest, and is so little explored, one must assume it solely exists to make the character in his otherwise all-too-fortunate situation possible to relate to for viewers familiar with reality.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is just one of many parts of Clannad that suggests some very meticulous engineering on behalf of the creators to appeal to young, lonely men. Perhaps it's no coincidence the writer of the visual novel the anime is based on is originally educated as a psychologist. One seeming example of his skills put to use is that every single girl in the show acts like a vulnerable, socially stunted child in some way, and the main character even has to teach several of them the basics of social interaction throughout. Just the kind of girls someone who finds three-dimensional girls threatening would be delighted to meet, in other words. Which is no criticism of anyone's social abilities, but rather of the cheap tricks Clannad uses in its attempts to get under your skin. Another example are the supernatural elements. Magical realism is one of my favorite tropes in fiction, but in Clannad it seems to serve no other purpose than to allow the easy creation of unreasonably pathetic and tragic backgrounds for the girls.\\n\\n\r\nDespite Clannad's eagerness to manipulate, its bland-looking school hallways and classrooms, as well as characters that look so similar to each other I had problems differentiating many of them for the first half of the show, all accompanied by a repetitive, tacky soundtrack that seems taken straight out of a hotel elevator ... Well, sometimes Clannad manages to be genuinely touching. Mind you, not even as close to as often as it wants to be, but in particular in the later episodes. It's also very funny at times. I don't really laugh when I watch stuff, but a running gag where the usually serious main character fools the other characters by saying outrageous things with a straight face, often pushed me. And in interviews the writer of the visual novels seems very sincere about his work. So what is really Clannad? Manipulative and hypocritical? Or very sappy, but occasionally moving and often fun? Probably all these things, but in total not very good.",

            "content": "For me, Clannad was a truly unique and enjoyable experience. It has the power to draw out the emotions of the viewer like no other anime I have ever seen, and the slice-of-life / fantasy / romance mix was so well executed that I would get shivers after many episodes down the left side of my body (yes, the left side, I suppose that's because the right brain is the fanciful open-minded, creative side). Anyway, lets get on with this review.\r\nSTORY: 9/10\r\nOkazaki Tomoya is an average \"delinquent\" - too lazy to study or do anything worthwhile. He spends all day hanging out with his friendSunohara, and they basically waste their time doing nothing. However, all of this changes when Tomoya meets Nagisa, a girl a year older than him that had to return to high school due to her missing a year. From here, it takes off fairly quickly, and its the unexplained wonders of the story that make it such an amazing anime to watch. These moments wouldnt be complete without the great music, however.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really like the eye styles in Clannad and how the characters are drawn. Other than that the art is just your average school-anime art with your average school-anime backdrops, except when it, at times, goes into 3-D (which looks fantastic but doesnt happen too often). That said, I don't have any beefs with the art, it's all about how they draw the characters, which was done very well.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and the ED were never very good, in fact I pretty much didnt like the opening at all and I forgot what the ED was. I just have to give this section a 10 because the background music is just SO amazing. It captures perfectly the emotions of the characters and the mystical scenes that take place every once and a while. Without this music, the anime would have half the emotion that it does now, so kudos to the music writers, I can never get some of those songs out of my head now...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI docked one point cause some of the characters are pretty stereotypical. Passive agressive friend character. Tsundere (hint hint my avatar) girl with a sister who is basically the shyest person ever created ever. Aaaand of course all the filler characters who don't matter. But there are plenty of unique characters in this anime, and even the cliche characters never got on my nerves (well... pretty much never, fuko...). In any case, as Clannad went on I found myself getting more and more attached to these characters, who end up being very well fleshed out. There's always one character that you will connect with in any good anime, and this anime is no exception.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat more is there to say about this anime. Truly fantastic and a joy to watch. It may start out a bit slow, but please bear with it for the first few episodes. I found the slow pace to be relaxing, since I live in the U.S. where every day is about rushing to do something important. Clannad has been my source of relaxation on those hurried days, its just an anime about love, life, and life's mysteries. With all the fast paced shows of today, Clannad is a sigh of relief and a must watch.",

            "content": "The world, as many of us know, has been polluted with anime called harems. Five plus girls. One oblivious tool of a man. There can be only one. Yeah, that can get old. You can count on at least two every season, with nothing to be worthwhile. That is until I caught sight of Clannad, an anime adaption of my favorite visual novel created by Key. At first I was skeptical, ESPECIALLY after the horrible movie adaption, so I went into it with low expectations. Fortunately, Clannad didn't let me down.\r\nUnlike other harems, the main male, Tomoya, is less fortunate the other leads. His motherdied at a young age leaving him with his father, who became an alcoholic and a gambler out of depression. Hating the town he lives in, he continues on living with no motivation until one day he meets Nagisa, a fragile girl who stands nervously at the bottom of the hill on the way to school, scared. After encouraging her to be strong and make new memories in her new year, he finds himself motivated to helping her with her dilemas including joining the schools drama club. Among other characters are Sunahora, the comedic dope who is Tomoya's closest friend, Ryou and Kyou, who are twins who hang out with the two, Kotomi, a quite genious who's socially awkward, and Tomoyo, a strong woman who is running for student council president. The series basically goes through their school life as many harems do, but the comedy is some of the best in anime, as well as the drama being very heavy. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is very sharp. Within the first 5 minutes, I knew I'd be in for a treat for sure. Not only is the art good, it combines crisp CGI animation as well, which completely impressed me.\\n\\n\r\nI was on the fence about the soundtrack honestly,, mainly because I played the game. The soundtrack is the same, with the exception of the ED, which is one of the tracks with words put to it (Dango Daikazokou), which isn't the problem, because the games soundtrack is nothing short of a master work. The problems lies in where those tracks are placed. The songs didn't really go with what was happening some of the time, and was a little confusing. This was the only thing that made me think it might end up like other harems, but thankfully, this wasn't that big of a deal. In fact, there were some moments where it does work, and very nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters would be Clannad's strongest suit. Each character has such personality, it can be overwhelming. Not only the main characters are this way, but supporting as well, notably Nagisa's parents, Akio and Sanae. \\n\\n\r\nEach episode was ball to watch, and it was easy to keep watching. I never had a moment where I wanted to drop. However, I didn't have a moment where I needed to see the next episode either. Clannad is easily the best harem out there, but it needed to be more than that. NOTE: I am specifically reviewing the FIRST SEASON. If you believe I am being harsh, wait until I write my Clannad AS review. In short, I would highly recommend it to viewers because they would then be able to watch the second season. As far as the first season is concerned, it will still be a great watch full of laughs and watery eyes, and in itself, I would recommend it as well.",

I don't know about all the other reviews but the 3 reviews I've read were extremely long on this anime and I don't know about you but I'm not gonna read an essay for a review.\r\nStory (10/10):\r\nThe story developed rather fast but I guess that's what you had to do if you only had one season to make certain events happen. But I believe the director made it work out. But the main thing is whom Tomoya will end upwith. There are also tons of flashbacks that hint the fate of our main character, Tomoya. Amazingly, in the sequel, all of the hints are connected together for us and we find what becomes of Tomoya; everything, who he goes out with and what happens after season 1 ends.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10):\\n\r\nI don't even know what to write about in art. I mean the art... was it important. For some of us yeah... But I believe that there could be some changes when they animate someone crying. Kind of looks like they were happy instead of sad. I could never tell... But everything else for art, I would say it was proficient.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\r\nSame thing as art... Just replace art with sounds? Simple... But it was not the art or sound that made this anime great. Don't let that hinder your judgement. In fact, don't judge until you watch both seasons.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10):\\n\r\nSome people may say that the characters always make different decisions for the same situation and that they were not being static. Meaning that the writer failed to decide what the character would do accordingly to the personality/behavior created for the specific character. But I don't think so. Cause they are static characters... Meaning they change. Why did they change. Well be nice if you watched it... These character were also uniquely made/created, they specifically were made to trigger certain events in the story/plot. Without these characters the story may as well fall apart.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nIt was a captivating anime. It kept me asking what would happen in the next and following episode and trust me I was not disappointed to know. But if you don't trust me, ask yourself this: Who else knows me better than me? If you like a Romantic-Comedy, this is an anime for you. But let's not forget that there are still drama in it but I'm not a genius and I don't know genre or how to put them together but my best guess is Dramatic-Romantic-Comedy. Don't ask why I'm so smart. I'm not took me years to figure that one out...",

            "content": "I've often wondered if the alterior motive of harem anime isn't the teach girls to fall for the guys who need it most because otherwise they will fall wayward in society and become a burden to their country. So, one of the aspects that I truly appreciated  about this anime was the gradual build-up of Okazaki's relationships throughout the series. Although it was obviously Clannad's destiny to become a harem anime (we still have cute girls doing cute things and being constantly adorable), we don't see those exact reactions from the start. We all know that's what's going to happen, the set-up is there, but this anime is more about building relationships than about the cool guy on campus who gets a lot of girls even though he's a loser. And, for me, the best part was that the set-up was much better than most anime in its genre. \\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist, Okazaki Tomoya, for example, plays the character who becomes the \"cool guy on campus\" - the one all the girls go for. However, he gets there by being a good person and helping the people he grows to care for out with their dreams, troubles and decisions. He isn't smart or suave, doesn't participate in after school activities and furthermore he's a deliquent, as a number of the male protagnonists in anime of the harem genre tend to be, but even that has a background story and it isn't just because he's lazy. We know he's a smart guy, so if he applied himself he would likely do well. People who get to know him grow to admire him because honest, resourceful, and kind. Another trait he exhibits regularly (along with his almost painfully blunt honesty) is tenderness, which of course the girls in this anime respond and look up to. Each grows to care for him for more reasons than just being a cute, perverted, dumb guy for them to look after and I found that to be very refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nI would say this anime's greatest assets are it's Director and its Editors. One of the more exciting moments for me was seeing how much thought was put into the opening scene where Okazaki and Furukawa Nagisa (the first of many love interests introduced in this series) first meet. I won't spoil it for you, but some wonderful decisions were made as to exactly how it should be shot and as a film geek, I found them to be extremely well thought out and impressive. I haven't read the visual novel, so I am not certain whether credit is due to the directors of the anime or the visual novel, but whomever thought of that sequence - I thank and admire your efforts! \\n\\n\r\nThis is only one fine example of the quality of editing and direction found in the series. And while I love anime, clever direction and editing tricks is not necessarily something I either expect or look forward to. Not to say they are never there, but it isn't the primary focus, because it doesn't really need to be. And yet once in awhile I see something that just astounds me and I wish to applaud the effort and talent -- Clannad is one such example. \\n\\n\r\nI would highly recommend Clannad. It's a great anime that teaches the importance of friendship, kindness and helping those you care for. It's skillfully made with a great story and well developed sense of growth. So, whether you're looking for more than just a simple harem anime or you're someone who just wants an anime of cute girls doing cute things and being adorable, I think Clannad is the best place to start. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, have you ever heard a cuter, more happy song than Dango Daikazoku? It never fails to cheer me up in some mystical way.",

This is quite possibly one of the worst romances I have ever seen. \r\nI'll start off with the characters:\r\nThey are all annoying as heck with one dimensional personalities and most of them act so innocent and dumb it's hard to watch.\r\nThe art style is so bland and the eyes of the characters are humongous. It's art style looks like its aimed towards 3rd graders.\r\nThe ending song is the only redeeming factor of the sound/music in this series and after hearing it 20 times, It just gets dreadful and annoying and reminds me of the really bad characters.\r\nEach \"arc\" wherethe main character helps some side characters that disappear forever afterwards take wayyyyy too long and are plain uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\nThe two MC's have no chemistry at all and this is a disgrace to romance.\\n\\n",

The ED has nothing to do with the main plot in the anime. Absolutely nothing. And yet it is loved by many as it's just soo... kawaiii >_< Youhave to watch it yourself to find out.\\n\r\nSo far there some developement for the main characters. It's going in a nice pace.\\n\r\nThe humour in this anime really hits the spot. Sometimes there are scenes that just makes it looks like a game (I didn't play the game so I don't know whether they're similar or not) There are also times where the characters reactions to certain things are just so unexpected.\\n\r\nI really love this anime &amp; I hope you'll will too =D",

            "content": "Story:\r\nThe story is basically that the main character Tomoya Okazaki meets a girl named Nagisa Furukawa and helps her with reviving their schools drama club. Along the way he also meets other girls who have problems of their own, and as a main character it's his duty to help them out with those problems.\r\nThe story is then divided into different arcs, dealing with one of the girls at a time and with their tragic backstories.\r\nIt isn't a bad idea for a story. The girls backstories deal a lot with family problems which i haven't seen in a lot of animes and is also what givesit it's name (in old irish Clannad means family).\\n\r\nBut I think it is pretty poorly executed sadly.\\n\\n\r\nNot everything was bad though, I found the comedic moments to be hilarious at times and were the parts of the anime I enjoyed the most.\\n\r\nThe last two arcs of the anime was pretty good too but the first three arcs before that could have been a lot better.\\n\r\nEspecially the one dealing with the character of Fuuko which had a lot of plot holes and didn't change the story or the characters in any way so it wasn't really needed. \\n\\n\r\nYou could actually say that about the other first two arcs as well as they don't pushes the story forward and is only there to make you care for the characters that is focused on. It's not really bad to do that but their backstories are never brought up again so it feels like it's there just because.\\n\r\nI think it's because it's made from a VN and the arcs are different routes with that specific character.\\n\r\nThis also means that after a characters arc is finished, they will be pushed aside and won't be focused on after that. \\n\r\n[4/10]\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are really good and fits well with the mood but that is something to be expected from Kyoto Animation.\\n\r\nThe character designs were a bit weird because the girl characters eyes\\n\r\nwere bigger than the guys which looked a bit weird to me but wasn't that much of a problem. I'm guessing that they wanted to make the girls look cuter to make up for their personality\\n\\n\r\nThe show had really good and fluid animation at some parts especially in the first few episodes and sometimes when they played sport.\\n\r\n[7/10]\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI will only write about a few of the characters because otherwise this will take forever.\\n\\n\r\nTomoya was fun to watch in the comedic moments because he is a bit of an asshole which made him stand out more than other harem main characters. I liked the drama between him and his father too and would have liked to see more of it.\\n\r\nSadly in many of the more serious moments he becomes a pretty generic character that helps everyone even doe he hardly knows them.\\n\\n\r\nNagisa is the main female character but sadly a very uninteresting one.\\n\r\nThere is nothing really special about her and she can't really do anything on her own, so there was not much reason to care for her.\\n\r\nWhich is sad because some of the other characters that got less screen-time than her were more interesting and likeable.\\n\\n\r\nYouhei Sunohara is a friend of Tomoya and everyones favourite punching bag. He is a delinquent who doesn't care much for school and for the most part just hang around Tomoya. He serves as the comic relief and there certainly are funny moments with him. Mostly with Tomoya who tricks him into doing stupid thing and ends with him getting his ass kicked.\\n\r\nWhile he isn't that interesting of a character, I would probably say that he one of the characters i enjoyed the most. \\n\r\n[4/10]\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe anime has a great soundtrack that fits well with what is happening on screen. This show really tries to pull your heartstrings and i think that it definitely did it's job even doe i think the anime goes a bit overboard with the drama at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was also good overall. The voice actors seemed that they had fun with their roles and they all did a good performance.\\n\r\nBut some of the female characters (Nagisa for example) speak in a very childish way which seems weird since they are in high school. But like with the artstyle of the characters i think they speak like that to sound cuter. [8/10]\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nLike i said the comedic moments in Clannad are pretty hilarious for the most part and certainly made me enjoy the show overall. The more serious moments however were not that intriguing to me. That's mostly because the characters didn't get enough screen time to make me like them. \\n\r\nBut i have to admit that the stories were pretty interesting at first even if some of them had some irritating plot-holes or unneeded for the story (the first three arcs). [5/10]\\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\r\nI think Clannad was decent overall.\\n\r\nIt was funny, great sountrack and had really good animation and art.\\n\r\nBut it suffers from some uninteresting and dull characters that could have been a lot better. The first three arcs could also have been handled much better in my opinion, but I enjoyed the last two more.\\n\\n\r\nI would say that if you haven't seen it you should at least give it a try.\\n\r\nMaybe you will enjoy it more than i did and i think that is especially true to moe fans. \\n\r\nJust don't expect it to be a masterpiece because you might end up dissapointed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is going to be a fairly short anime review but itll be worth once you have read it all.  I am going to tell you guys all why i rated this show as I did. So lets get started. (no spoilers)\r\nFirst off the story 8/10: The storyis about Okazaki Tomoya is a delinquent who finds life dull and believes he'll never amount to anything. Along with his friend Sunohara, he skips school and plans to waste his high school days away.\r\nOne day while walking to school, Tomoya passes a young girl muttering quietly to herself. Without warning she exclaims \"Anpan!\" (a popular Japanesefood) which catches Tomoya's attention. He soon discovers the girl's name is Furukawa Nagisa and that she exclaims things she likes in order to motivate herself. Nagisa claims they are now friends, but Tomoya walks away passing the encounter off as nothing.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Tomoya finds he is noticing Nagisa more and more around school. Eventually he concedes and befriends her. Tomoya learns Nagisa has been held back a year due to a severe illness and that her dream is to revive the school's drama club. Claiming he has nothing better to do, he decides to help her achieve this goal along with the help of four other girls.\\n\\n\r\nAs Tomoya spends more time with the girls, he learns more about them and their problems. As he attempts to help each girl overcome her respective obstacle, he begins to realise life isn't as dull as he once thought. (synopsis) I rated the story 8/10 because at times the story would have dull moments where you would be thinking what the heck just went down? For instance when I first started the show and it kept showing the robot and the girl I was thinking to myself what the hell does that have to do with anything, but I soon realized what it was all for later. Anyways the story sets itself on the right track right out of the gate. The biggest problem would be the pace at the beginning of the show and how he solves the problems, I personally thought that its was very obvious what was going to happen. \\n\\n\r\nThe art 9/10: Very very great detail the outside setting was amazing. I'll give a big hand to the artist's of this show they are very skilled. Not much else to say about the art haha.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound 9/10: the english dub was great though I did see a few flaws but it wasnt anything worth mentioning in this review. I have not seen the subbed version so this is purely dubbed.\\n\\n\r\nThe Character 9/10: Each character was developed nicely. You got a piece of every character throughtout the show. Which is a great thing because they all bring personalities that are all different. My favorite character in the show would be Sunohara because his personality was the best. I liked the way he would be perverted and was always funny in the show. Which made the pacing of the show seem a bit quicker. He was also great because he would get beaten up by a chick which is something you dont see very often.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 : personally I am a big fan of the romantic genre so I really really enjoyed this anime. From beginning to end I sought my self being brought to tears. If you watch this from beginning to end you will get hit so hard in the feels its not even funny. I got alot of enjoyment out of this anime because I liked to see all of the different situations that they would get themselves into and how they would solver their problems. What an outstanding anime to watch. There are alot of words that can be used to describe this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: all of my reasons above. WHAT A GREAT ANIME TO WATCH IF YOURE A BIG FAN OF THE ROMANTIC GENRE. IM LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING ANOTHER GREAT ANIME THAT WILL COME OUT IN THE NEAR FUTURE THAT WILL COME TO PAR WITH THIS SHOW. \\n\\n\r\nI KNOW I WASNT SUPPOSED TO PUT A SYNOPSIS BUT I USED IT AS A GUIDELINE SORRY MYANIMELIST XD",

Very sad in a happy form. (i cried numourous times...very heart warming) this anime has a lot of metaphors and expressions used to convey human emotion through different conditions. Very artistic, quick paced, and very reasonable length of different stories within the series.I enjoyed this anime so much i watch the an entire 19 episodes in 1 day. that is pretty much iver 85% of the entire series. I recommend this anime to people who loves to venture into a more indept personal feeling within the characters and who can handle a lot of drama. The mood killer really was necessary for me. the anime became way to heavy quick. i hope you guys enjoy this anime.",

            "content": "Romances/Dramas aren't really my bag, and to be honest, I came into watching this Anime with low expectations. But with low expectations, come outstanding surprises.\r\nThe show focuses around the life and times of a senior in High School, Tomoya Okazaki. He's a self described delinquent and frequently skips school, however, underneath his tough guy facade and satirical jokes, he's just a regular student who lacks direction in his life. That is, until he meets the love of his life and several other buxom beauties.\r\nThe story is great as it mixes real life problems, such as relationships, troubling pasts and the inability to articulate oneself inpublic with other problems of a more supernatural nature.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I wouldn't describe this story as entirely realistic the message it communicates is very strong and the voice acting and music is lovely. However, I will complain about the opening and ending songs, as, I felt they ruined the atmosphere of the show or just didn't mesh that well no matter how well they were actually related to it.\\n\\n\r\nTomoya's friend, Youhei Sunoharo, remains particularly static throughout the series, and while that does leave some disappointment as I was hoping he would come into his self during his senior year of High School as the other characters did, he was still amusing for comic relief.\\n\\n\r\nOn Tomoya's quest to do as little as possible during his senior year he meets a variety of interesting characters, ranging from ex gang members to super genius's and in doing so recruits a makeshift harem of weirdos and oddballs. While not every member of this harem is interested in him at first, he soon captures the hearts of all of them with his satire, cruel jokes, and compassionate side he modestly brushes off.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there are no actual cat fights over Tomoya, there is still a sportsman like competition for his affection. In so doing, Tomoya learns of the many problems of his friends and possible lovers. These side back stories of the main characters were poorly done in most cases. Whereas the characters could have been much, much deeper they instead portray the entirety of the character and simplify them. By this I mean, the entire personality of the character can be summed up in a few episodes regarding an event in their past - making the characters slightly shallow and lacking the many intricacies of the human psyche.\\n\\n\r\nBut, this story is a tear jerker, if you will, and does have some really nice moments where it's completely depressing, and thanks to the wonderful voice acting and beautiful music, they really hit home - especially if you have some semblance to one of the character's past.\\n\\n\r\nWhile times are good while the story's progressing, in it's finality it felt lacking. For some reason, after watching the final episode the story felt unfinished. It completely left the story open for anything to happen, and the main character, just like in the beginning of the story, has no balls.\\n\\n\r\nThere weren't very many inconsistencies, however, it never actually describes how the main character gets money. They say that he has a part time job, but they never explore that and with his situation at home, his unlimited funding seems out of place. While it's a small complaint, things like that just bug me.\\n\\n\r\nSo, despite a few static or shallow aspects, a bad ending, and a few inconsistencies along the way, it's really a great anime that I would suggest to anyone who likes the stereotypical romance story. Not bad for guys, either. I'm telling you, I was really pleasantly surprised with this one.",

At the beginning of watching it, I was rather thinking it is going to be a typical and dull story, but to my astonishment it went totally differently. Once it catches your attention, you will treasure it wholeheartedly. The whole concept of the story may be seen asboring - since, what is so special about high school students who fell in love with each other? As it turns out, there is something more beyond it. There is solitude, love, family problems, school problems, dreams, desires, death, friendships. It's a story where one event, one single meeting turns upside down someone else's life. Till the very last episode the ending is not obvious. Every little detail matches each other, which is great. Some characters appear unexpectedly making it even more mysterious. In spite of various personalities, different points of views, the characters actually get along very well together. Every step the main characters attempt, is meant for something.

            "content": "Clannad. Made as a visual novel by Key, made into an anime by Kyoto Animation. This combination has been seen twice before, in the series Air and Kanon. Both are well-known among anime fans, and mostly positively received. And anyone who has watched either or both of the two previously mentioned will definitely have their expetations of what Clannad will offer. These expectiations will probably, in a way, be fulfilled; yet Clannad is certain to sweep you along and astound it with its gripping tale. \r\nThe story itself is set to a small Japanese town, and a select few inhabitants of that town. The firstperson to note is Okazaki Tomoya, a high school senior notorious at school for being a tardy delinquent; always late for classes, if he shows up at all, and he surely doesn't care for anything. And while that is true, he isn't the kind of person who goes looking for fights and has a foul mouth. The reason for his current life situation is a complex one, but can be summarized as such: He's simply bored. Of going to school. Classes. The town he lives in. His home and drunkard father.\\n\\n\r\nThat however, changes drastically one day, when walking to school. he hears a girl mutter the word 'anpan' to herself. This draws on his curiosity, and before long, the two of them are talking to each other. The girl, Nagisa Furukawa, evidently mutters names of foods she likes, to give her the confidence to get through the day. She is currently repeating her senior year due to illness, and she has one thing she absolutely must do: Re-establish the school's drama club.\\n\\n\r\nTo do this she needs members. And before long herself and Tomoya are looking around the school for new members. And here the somewhat-standard harem cast is built up. The soon-to-be drama club members are for the most part girls, each with their distinct personality and quirks which probably aren't unknown to someone slightly experienced with this kind of anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe route it takes from here is, at its bones and skeleton, a standard visual novel approach. There are several story arcs covering various amounts of episodes; each arc focusing on a specific girl. Of course, this means that the girls have their problems and issues which they have to deal with. And our main characters do just that, by valiant effort to help their newfound friends. And a little bit of Dr. Phil mixed in. One of my pet peeves with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut from what we now know, it sounds like any other anime of this type. So what is it that sets Clannad apart from the rest, and elevates it above them? \\n\\n\r\nThe first answer would be the characters. Yes, they start out a bit clich\u00e9, in some ways, but that's not really a bad thing. Making totally original characters personality-wise nowadays isn't that easy after all. What Clannad does with the characters after their introduction, however, is amazing. Not only are their struggles portrayed excellently and grippingly, they develop into strong induvidials who are there for their friends, who can face the world and its hardships more openly.\\n\\n\r\nThe second answer lies in its themes. Here it completely blows everything else out of the water, because what the producers want to tell us through Clannad is realistic and believable what concerns both actual plot execution and message. What the characters do, I can belive. What they learn from their struggles, I can learn and take with me to real life. That's how strong Clannad's message is.\\n\\n\r\nMostly it's about family. What is a family? Who can be family? How important are bonds? What if you don't have proper family at home; only jerks with no right to call themselves your family? Clannad tells us that a family can be found anywhere; not only in our own home. The main characters of the show may just find their own little family together, as they work with the drama club. \\n\\n\r\nA character which I think deserves extra mention is Sunohara. He is in many ways the comedic relief person; when you see him around you expect something funny to happen. Or well, at least that's what you're supposed to do. But Sunohara isn't just a blond, shallow klutz. At times he really shines through with his deep character, proving that he, too, can be a capable supporter among his friends.\\n\\n\r\nAs most would expect of Kyoto Animation, the animation budget is all but slim. One of the things which makes Clannad so lifelike is the animation itself, through sheer quality. Lucid, vivid and soft colours makes sure the eye is pleased through gentle contrasts and lifelike static and non-static objects on-screen, be that walls, characters, cityscapes or other such things. The detail level is exceptionally high, which again contributes to that feeling of the series being alive. Clothing, furniture, decorations, it's all there and looking truly neat. But what contributes most to this feeling of being alive lies in the character motions. Not only are they fluid and pleasant to watch, they're abundant. You've most likely watched a series only to find that the characters walk stiffly, and when they talk they remain static during the whole conversation, save for maybe one or two motions. In Clannad, they swing their arms to be dramatic and to prove their points. They aren't static when jsut standing upright speaking. They do things during conversations which ensures that they seem more like real humans standing there than 2d anime characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what would a show be without its music? Just as the animation contributes to the series coming alive, the music does an outstanding job at amplifying the emotions portrayed. Many of the themes are dramatic, sad; this to reflect the overall sadness of Clannad. Yet there are other themes too which fit right in. The standard new day at school theme, some comedy-like themes, they are all there. And they are composed beautifully, making sure every mood swing and feeling sweeps your heart away, gripping at your innermost feelings of empathy and compasion for the characters. The opening theme, remixed from the game's counterpart, is a lovely upbeat theme mixing strings, a neat bass and percussion all mixed into an allegro which has interesting lyrics as the topping. The end theme is basically a metaphor for what goes on; the dango family representing Nagisa and the caring people around her. It is a very bittersweet tune, offering cuteness and melancholy all the same.\\n\\n\r\nAnd parallelling all that happens is the story of a girl in a world that has ended. A strange, mysterious world, where she is alone. All alone, savefor a doll she built from scrap metal. What this symbolizes and means, you can watch for yourself. Though, this side-story's relevance to the main plot is not revealed properly before the second season.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Clannad offered a very pleasant surprise to me; offering both enticing themes, a fresh plot and interesting, deep characters. Once during the season I also had to experience a tear making its way down my cheek. That's the kind of anime this is. If you haven't watched it, you should definitely give it a try.\\n\r\nI found this review Helpful\\n\r\nshow less",

I heard quite a few good things about the show since it was released and so I finally decided to watch it.\r\nAfter the first episode I was hooked. This isn't your traditional anime. It is more like poetry. From the first episode I pretty much knew that I wouldn't regret spending my time with this show. Little did I know, it was much more then that.\r\nAs the show progressed I realized that it wasn't the usual teenage drama, it delved into some really emotional themes. Clannad pulls at yourheart at every chance it gets, and when you're down and you think you can't take any more it kicks you again.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation style was beautiful as well, it gave a euphoric feel to the entire show. The character design was rather bland but being based off a graphic novel the character design was spot on. \\n\\n\r\nClannad has had a weird emotional impact, one that I can't really explain. All that I can say is that it was beautiful, emotional experience. It was poetry. It wasn't simply another good anime, it was in a league of its own.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend that you watch Clannad and Clannd After Story but be prepared to feel emotions you have never felt with any other anime or TV series before.",

            "content": "All it took was a small trip to my local anime store that was having a 2-for-1 special for secondhand DVDs for me to come across a series which I'll always hold a special place for in my heart, a programme which was no doubt an emotional roller-coaster that was a harrowing tale of love and loss. Unfortunately, that very programme suffers from a *very* lacklustre beginning. What is this programme you ask? Why it's none other than Clannad: After Story and its lacklustre beginning is this very season.\r\nIt's no secret that us Desi folks get pretty damn melodramatic and sentimental at times. We LOVEthe shit out of our romances and melodramas. Can you name ONE Desi person who hasn't cried once whilst watching Kal Ho Naa Ho or Baghban? Okay, maybe the younger folks don't have a taste for that stuff but I certainly do (and so do my parents... who like to kick me out of the house every time we watch Baghban together because of the infamous guilt trip that movie begets). \\n\\n\r\nWhat does all this shit have to do with anything? I don't know, but one thing's for certain: this season of Clannad is a romantic melodrama to the core and yet it completely failed at eliciting an emotional response out of me a good majority of the time (which is a feat in and of itself given my tastes). Regardless, this season ain't all bad. In fact, I really did like it but I didn't find it \"poignant,\" \"compelling,\" or \"heartbreaking\" like the back of the DVD box says it is.\\n\\n\r\n***THE CONCEPT AND SETTING***\\n\\n\r\nClannad follows the story of Tomoya Okazaki, a delinquent high school student who hates where he lives because it's full of too many painful memories and his adventures with several other girls, each with their own sets of problems that he needs to help them solve. However, there's another event happening in different world as Tomoya et al are going about their lives: a girl who is the last of her kind all alone on an unknown world builds a companion out of junk who wants to help her leave this place before the winter comes and eventually takes her life. How do these stories connect? Tune in to find that out and MORE on the next episode of... DRAGON BALL Z!!!!\\n\\n\r\nIn case you haven't noticed by now, this is the third instalment of a series of visual novel adaptations produced by Kyoto Animation and KEY Visual Arts and a hallmark of these visual novel adaptations is a seemingly mundane setting mixed together with a supernatural element of sorts which gradually becomes more important as the series progresses. Now I haven't seen (nor do I have any interest in) Air or Kanon (2006) but I can safely say this: if you are NOT a fan of moe, inadvertent harems, supernatural stuff in your slice-of-life programmes, or moe drama... you probably won't like Clannad which is a real shame because After Story is definitely several leagues above this season but I digress.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the concept and how it's explored... well, it isn't explored very much here (or all that much in After Story... oddly enough). The first episode literally starts with an opening monologue from Tomoya who says \"I hate this town, it's too filled with memories I'd rather forget.\" What are these memories that he'd rather forget? Why is his relationship with his father strained? None of these questions are answered at all and whilst After Story does a good job of cleaning up those loose plot threads, there are still some questions left unanswered as the show puts more focus on the story of Tomoya et al in the here and now rather than explaining what happened in the past.\\n\\n\r\nThis is more or less the case throughout the entirety of Clannad for various plot threads, especially given how it puts more emphasis on the stories of certain girls but then throws everyone else to the wayside as the anime adapts that particular girl's arc from the visual novel. Remember Nagisa? You know... the girl that Tomoya meets that one fateful day at the beginning of the first episode? She's no better than a supporting character for the bulk of this season. The same goes for Kyou, you know... that tsundere twin who Tomoya should call Jacoby and Meyers on? Granted, After Story DOES put in some work to fix this, but it's too little too late by that point.\\n\\n\r\n***THE STORY***\\n\\n\r\nConsidering the fact that Clannad is a visual novel adaptation (a romance visual novel adaptation at that), it's no surprise that there is an inadvertent harem that forms over the course of the series and that Tomoya is the only useful guy around for the bulk of this programme's run. Unfortunately, that's my biggest problem with the story of Clannad. As far as visual novel adaptations go, it isn't exactly a cut above the rest of its competition when it comes down to execution for a variety of different reasons.\\n\\n\r\nFor one thing, there are certain nuances which make perfect sense in a visual novel context but when translated over to an anime context, they work to its detriment. If you need a good example of what I'm talking about, look no further than the way that the characters are handled. Visual novels are fundamentally designed in such a way where certain characters and arcs are often thrown to the wayside based on the route you choose to play through. In an anime context, that nuance doesn't work well and is often considered to be poor/lazy writing. This especially works to its detriment when we're talking about how each of the girls' arcs are adapted.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, KEY's visual novels were never meant to be adapted in a linear fashion. This is a ROMANCE visual novel adaptation. You know that Tomoya would've hooked up with the girl whose arc was being adapted by the end of it all, and yet somehow this show still gives off the vibe that Tomoya and Nagisa are going to end up together (spoilers: they do). Now this didn't really bother me that much since I understand the context of the adaptation but that still doesn't change the fact that these problems could've easily been avoided had there been more foresight. I mean, why didn't Tomoyo and Sunohara have a romantic subplot which actually adapted her arc of the visual novel? In hindsight, that would've worked a lot better rather than having Tomoya move over to Tomoyo once he was through with Kotomi's arc. There are WAY more instances like that than I let on, by the way.\\n\\n\r\nThe supernatural aspect of Clannad is also something that a great many people end up taking umbrage with and I definitely understand that sentiment as it DOES get rather ridiculous at times. There is a way to do supernatural stuff in drama right (look no further than the 1990 film, Ghost), but this doesn't apply to Clannad or the rest of the KEY visual novel adaptations whatsoever. At the same time, the supernatural elements of Clannad become far less prevalent as the series progresses (even moreso in After Story) so it's not as bad as it would initially seem. What is present however is intrusive enough to deter prospective viewers from giving this series a proper chance.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing that I want to talk about when it comes down to the story of this season is the fact that it plays out more like an archetypal moe drama. We're presented with a bunch of cute girls who are then swiftly beaten with the angsty crowbar until they end up like Jason Todd and then they turn into cardboard cut-outs for the viewer to project their fantasies of consoling and/or fucking vulnerable girls. As ugly as that sounds, it's the truth and no amount of pathos, gorgeous animation, endearing character quirks, and funny/heartwarming moments can ever change that. \\n\\n\r\nIt's all about eliciting an emotional response out of the viewer and because of this, nothing about this season feels genuine. Can the same be said about After Story: NO. Unfortunately, first impressions tend to last forever and as far as first impressions go... Clannad fails to leave a strong one and in many cases, the fact that this season is so underwhelming has actually caused MANY to not even bother giving After Story a chance which is a genuine shame. Oh well, such is life as I like to say.\\n\\n\r\n***THE CHARACTERS***\\n\\n\r\nI really want to know it's possible to have such a large cast of characters but then make it so blatantly obvious that by the end of it all, only two people will ultimately matter (it also doesn't help that one of those people was quite heavily criticised for being grossly unrealistic). There were so many characters that I genuinely did find interesting like Kotomi, Tomoyo, and Sunohara but the geniuses at Kyoto Animation and KEY were basically all like \"Hey, you know those interesting characters we have that might very well be compelling individuals? Let's NOT use them to their full potential!\" Well, what we got is what we got so there's no sense in complaining about that now is there? Anyway, I'm just going to cover Tomoya, Akio, and Nagisa because that's what I wanna do. Don't like it? Well fuck off, I don't need your negativity here.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes down to saving graces, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone else like Tomoya who fits the bill and then some. I'll say this right now: Tomoya's character is flawed to high heaven in season and it really isn't until After Story where he truly does shine. Regardless, Tomoya is still a rather likeable individual in this season and it's quite evident that he grows and changes as an individual from the first episode all the way to the end. His constant snark never ceases to make me chuckle and out of the entire cast of Clannad, Tomoya feels the most human. Like I can actually believe that Tomoya is actually a real high school student who's been through a lot of crap in his life and simply lacks motivation. That's about as best as I can describe him anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAnother saving grace that Clannad has is Akio, Nagisa's father. To put it short, any moment where Akio was on-screen was more than enough to make me smile and laugh raucously when the time was appropriate. I don't really have much of a fondness for the loud, hammy type but Akio is DEFINITELY an exception. Furthermore, there are actually times when he stops being the large ham and is actually capable of carrying on moments of drama rather well which is surprising since most comedic relief characters I've come across are brainless morons when it comes down to drama. With that said... not everything about Akio is all sunshine and rainbows. If you wanna know what I'm talking about, look no further than his offspring: Nagisa.\\n\\n\r\nI'll just say this right now: if you're not fond of idealised girlfriend characters, you're probably going to hate Nagisa. I'll admit that of all the girls introduced throughout Clannad, Nagisa has to be the most boring of them all and yet she ended up being Tomoya's choice by the end of it all. I don't hate Nagisa whatsoever, in fact... I do quite like her. At the same time, it's the fact that we don't know as much about Nagisa in comparison to Tomoyo and Kotomi. People like to rag on Nagisa saying that barring her insecurity, she's an otherwise flawless character and I don't think that's entirely true.\\n\\n\r\nInsecurity in and of itself is a powerful flaw which can bring an otherwise perfect character down to reality and make them easier to connect with (ref: Belldandy from Ah! My Goddess) and in Nagisa's case, it does seem to work the same way. However, even though we know that Nagisa is a flawed individual, we still don't know much else about her. All we really know about her is that she's sickly crybaby with low self-esteem who happens to like the Big Dango Family and anpan/tonkatsu. Like really? Come on... With that said, it's not like she's without her redeeming qualities (outside of being so moe and adorable).\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest redeeming quality that Nagisa has is the fact that she's the catalyst for Tomoya's growth as a character across the entirety of Clannad (including After Story!). It really does sound clich\u00e9 and cheesy, but there are delinquents who actually change for the better because of a girlfriend or whatever. In Tomoya's case, it was Nagisa who was that very reason for him to change. It's quite obvious that Tomoya had a rather strained relationship with his father and had no ambitions in life and that chance encounter he had with Nagisa in the first episode was all it took for him to start bettering himself. Sure, the other girls definitely had a part to play but their roles weren't anywhere near as big as Nagisa's in Tomoya's life. \\n\\n\r\n***THE ART/ANIMATION***\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that you'll probably notice is the fact that pretty much ALL of the girls in Clannad are moe. Big eyes that are as large as the human forehead, tiny noses and small mouths, high-pitched voices, and the like are all prominent in KEY/Visual Arts (and by extension, most of Kyoto Animation's catalogue)'s work. If you can't look past that one particular detail, you'd do well to stay away from Clannad and opt for a different series like Kimi ni Todoke, ef: A Tale of Memories, Toradora, or Fruits Basket. However, if you happen to know that Clannad is one gigantic moe festival and you still want to keep going, that detail won't bother you all that much.\\n\\n\r\nFrom an artistic standpoint, Clannad has some of the best background artwork I've ever seen (no surprise there, this IS a KyoAni project after all). Everything is beautifully detailed and if I'm not mistaken, several parts of Clannad's overall setting were adapted from actual locations in Japan which is always a nice treat. The actual animation quality can be of variable quality however. There was just something about the character models that seemed a bit off from time to time, like one arm would be shorter than the other. Get what I mean?\\n\\n\r\nThere may very well be a good reason for that, as there are segments of Clannad that take place in an illusory world of sorts with a girl who's the last of her kind and her junk robot companion. Those segments were animated ENTIRELY in CG and it's absolutely GORGEOUS. Seriously, no lie. Most of the time, CG in anime would be horrendously clunky and have stilted animation (ref: Gantz, Knights of Sidonia) but I can safely say that it's not the case with Clannad whatsoever. The animation is fluid and has just as much detail if not MORE detail than the rest of the series does. Talk shit all you want about how these segments are unnecessary but the fact remains that they're quite the visual delectation.\\n\\n\r\n***THE SOUNDTRACK***\\n\\n\r\nOST-wise, Clannad delivers quite well. Every track that Clannad has to offer on the OST (barring the OP/ED for obvious reasons) fits whatever moment it's being played in extremely well. If I really had to pick an individual track that stood out to me the most througout the entirety of Clannad (this includes After Story, by the way), it would definitely have to be \"Yuki Nohara\" (Eng: Snowfield). It's a track that never ceases to bring me to tears for reasons that I'd love to tell you about but that would be a MASSIVE spoiler on my part and I dare not do such a thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme \"Megumeru\" by eufonius isn't a bad OP theme by any means, but it's certainly one that I don't really like listening to all that much because the theme itself sounds rather off-key from time to time. Like really... whose bright idea was it to even bother using this OP track in the first place if it sounds like that? The ED theme \"Dango Daikazoku\" by Chata is a different story. Whilst it's not an appropriate ED theme for some of the more dramatic episodes, it's still a nice song nonetheless (which later ends up being part of one of the most adorabe/heartwarming moments of After Story for... reasons).\\n\\n\r\n***THE DUB***\\n\\n\r\nBoth seasons of Clannad get shit for the dub because this season was directed by none other than the infamous Steven Foster. I'm not completely familiar with why this man gets a lot of hate for his dubs (probably because I haven't watched a lot of ADV/Sentai dubs that had him as the ADR director), so I can't really say whether or not this is one of his better dubs. What I can say though is that this dub receives WAY too much crap than it deserves. The entire cast does an absolutely spectacular job with the roles they've been given. It's also rather faithful to the original without sounding like weeaboo fan fiction in the slightest. Most importantly though, it still manages to capture the feel of Clannad even though it's dubbed which definitely nets a few points in my book.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there's no shortage of otherwise insignificant problems combining together which sours the overall experience. A few awkward line translations, a line delivery which sounds a bit off, mispronounced names, inconsistent usage of honourifics titles, etc, these are all problems that on their own wouldn't do much harm but when you lump them all together and have it directed by a much-maligned member of your staff... it's no surprise to see why people hate on this dub. Even so, I feel as though the good outweighs the bad when it comes down to the dubbing.\\n\\n\r\nFor one thing, I love how the voice actresses don't do that archetypal high-pitched moe voice that I don't really care much for to begin with when voicing the female characters. Don't get me wrong: Luci Christian, Hilary Haag, and Emily Neves sound cute voicing their respective characters, but they don't go out of their way to sound moe which is all fine and dandy in my book. The highlights of the cast are easily David Matranga as Tomoya, Luci Christian as Nagisa, Andrew Love as Akio, and Greg Ayres as Sunohara. I'm biased toward David Matranga's performane though, but that's mostly because his performance reminded me of his work as Tohno in the 5 Centimetres per Second dub (which coincidentally is another Steven Foster dub, a GOOD one, mind you).\\n\\n\r\nDoes the dub beat the sub? I wouldn't necessarily say that but it's certainly a LOT better than people make it out to be. If you're debating which one you should watch, I'd say it boils down to whether or not you want to hear moe when you're watching the show. If you want moe, go with the sub but if you don't want moe, stick with the dub.\\n\\n\r\n***FINAL THOUGHTS***\\n\\n\r\nClannad as it stands is fairly underwhelming but at the same time, it was definitely an enjoyable experience and it left a good-enough impression on me to the point where I actually wanted to see what would happen next in After Story. Even if you don't wanna check out After Story because you think it's overrated or whatever (which it kind of is, but that's beside the point), this season if Clannad is fairly entertaining in its own right. The comedy was spot-on most of the time and even though nothing really felt genuine about Clannad in the slightest, the final few episodes were more than enough to actually make me forgo watching the show with my brain and got me to watch it with my heart instead... cheesy though that might sound.\\n\\n\r\nIf you come out of this season underwhelmed and feeling like you want your money/time back, I highly urge you to watch After Story. As lacklustre as this season is, After Story is way more than enough to make up for it and then some. If you don't wanna give After Story a chance regardless... well, go onto the next section for another stuff that might suit your taste a little better.\\n\\n\r\n***ALTERNATE *MANGA* RECOMMENDATION***\\n\\n\r\nI'm only able to provide one recommendation for Clannad because I have WAY more stuff to recommend for After Story than I do this season. Go ahead and watch Air, Kanon, Angel Beats, or Little Busters if you want more of the same from KEY and KyoAni/PA Works though.\\n\\n\r\n1) Fruits Basket\\n\r\n- I'm recommending the manga over the anime for the simple reason that the anime was cut off before the manga ever reached its prime. Fruits Basket by and large is a paragon of its craft when it comes down to shoujo romance (and romantic drama in anime/manga in general). Much like Clannad, it has a rather lacklustre beginning but that quickly changes as the series turns into a harrowing tale of love and emotional hardship. Shameless plug for Fruits Basket review here: http://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=167669\\n\\n\r\n***AFTERWORD***\\n\\n\r\nIf you're planning on buying Clannad at all, be that this season or After Story, I urge you to buy the Blu-ray release instead of the DVD releases of the complete collection for the simple reason that the DVD releases come on those shitty spindle cases which force unnecessary wear on the discs and cost WAY too much given the price of the set altogether. It would be wise to buy Clannad whenever it's on sale at Right Stuf or Amazon, because Sentai's Blu-ray releases tend to be rather pricey. I mean, I got my copies of the DVD releases on sale and I can safely say I got what I paid for but still... why can't Sentai just package their shit normally like Funimation does? Oh well...",

            "content": "Based on a popular dating sim of the same name, Clannad  attempts to differ itself from the harem anime genre; a genre that is typically fantasies of having women want to throw themselves at the main character. Clannad, firstly, tries to deserve all that female attention, and secondly, it tries to have a heart. However, as it progresses, you realise that it's heart is either confused or concerningly ordinary and for most of the show's runtime, it lacks a brain.\r\nThe show centres around our protagonist, Tomoya, a delinquent that's been held back a year with his best friend Sunohara, who helps Nagisa attempt tomake her last year of high school her best by starting a drama club. It's a decent premise, but the show really boils down to a samey sequencing of events that quickly becomes stale, with the main plotline becoming sidelined awkwardly for subplots. The sequence of events that make up arcs:\\n\\n\r\n1) Tomoya meets a character\\n\r\n2) The character has a troubling background\\n\r\n3) Tomoya helps them overcome their background\\n\r\n4) The character Tomoya helps becomes attracted to him \\n\\n\r\nI guess this kind of thing originates from the visual novel it's based on. Still, the show's terrible ability to handle subplots really holds it down - and moreover, these subplots are just frankly tosh and the characters are worse.\\n\\n\r\nThe first character we meet is Nagisa. She's introduced with her sweet and kind perfection, but it is so sweet that it's sickening, and her voice is several degrees above listenable (and in the dub, she sounds just as vacant). What's worse is that her annoying selflessness is never confronted and her character is never developed further than that other than being a little oblivious and worrying that she is a burden to her parents. Still, she wants to make a drama club, and for some reason Tomoya hangs out with her and tries his best to get past the strange obstacles, imposed by the school, why she can't start this harmless club. Firstly, they need to get some more members (a fairly typical roadblock in club animes), giving a perfect excuse to go and meet some new characters and inject some depth and, hopefully, understand what these random scenes of a girl with a robot mean.\\n\\n\r\nWe meet all the characters pretty early but they're all sidelined as we begin Fuko's arc. Fuko is an incredibly immature girl that Tomoya snatches a carving knife from as she tries to make a star. Or a starfish. Obviously this is important, and there's some clunky foreshadowing as to how out of place she is in this show. I won't spoil it for you, but there is a twist to her character that will make you go \"huuuh?\" In fact, you'll be checking just what genre this show is. It's absurd considering how character driven the show is, and the moments of sadness escalated with characters weakly crying and sorrow (but repetitive) music attempt to draw tears. Heck, if you happen to relate to the ideas, you might cry too, but it's poor writing, especially considering how meaningless it all becomes.\\n\\n\r\nStill, there's a subtly building romance between Nagisa and Tomoya who essentially become Fuko's adopted parents. The background handling of Tomoya's father and Tomoya's character in general make you think this show might be onto... something. Hell, there are some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments in Tomoya's pranks, where he almost breaks the fourth-wall and laughs with the audience at how absurd the side characters are.\\n\\n\r\nMoving onto the next arc (usually as if nothing ever happens aside from some out of place comic relief moments?), the next storyline stays well within the boundaries of this universe but goes to ridiculously crazy portions. We focus on Kotome, the typical bookish girl. There's some more lazy writing as we delve into her backstory, utilising the awkward memory-loss trope, frankly stupid overreaction and continuing to rely on Tomoya to make everything better again, not without some help of several thousand random acts of kindness from random people this time. When she cries at the hard work that he has done, we feel like crying that this sorry excuse for a plotline is emotional on a purely standalone basis. Kudos to the crying animation, I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nIt's at this point that the show's inability to paint any signs of intellect in its female characters borders on sexism. Thankfully, Tomoyo, the scary-fighting girl comes (back) in, and is refreshingly human as she deflects her problems, but her backstory continues to be extremely contrived (I've come to expect this from this show). She also bucks the trend of having the actress talking in falsetto and a false-kawaii attitude. Unfortunately, this being a harem show, she obviously falls for Tomoya - and this is the part that breaks her. Without any overt signs, she suddenly becomes obsessed with him, and moreover, without any signs at all, she moves on. \\n\\n\r\nBack to Nagisa for the final arc. Remember her? They managed to sideline the romance from earlier and for so long such that it becomes clumsy when it randomly reappears at the climax of it. They've managed to make the drama club a reality and are working on a bizarre story. Wait, hang on, that sounds famiilar... Right! It's the random scenes that would open or close certain episodes that were inappropriate and, at best, vaguely foreshadowed the story they would be putting on. It doesn't sound anything like a children's story, not relevant for a school play, but what the hell? I've been asked to expect crazier stuff from this show.\\n\\n\r\nIt's important to discuss the strong subplot that's been building up over the show about Tomoya's father, who he has come to despise to the point of moving out and into Nagisa's place (obviously). This subplot was handled well, and comes into play to give a bittersweet ending with Tomoya's father as he turns up to the show he has helped produce.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Nagisa suffers from a case of bad-nerves, and after freezing on stage for longer than dramatically necessary, an eyerolly, cheesy and cringeworthy speech from her father is delivered that manages to make her finish the show (and my patience). Clannad having no grounding in reality nor humanity leads to the play being a hit with the audience. Later, the series somehow manages to still underwhelm as Tomoya chooses his brainless doll from the selection of his harem, followed by this anime finally finishing.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure what's worse; that I had to Google the forgetful character's names or that I remembered the others for nonsensical plotlines. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Browsing through Kyoto Animation's page on Wikipedia, I wanted to look for more laughs produced by the wonderful studio.  Finished with the very popular Haruhi, Lucky Star, and K-On!, one of them had caught my eye.  That was Clannad.  And I have to say, Clannad may quite possibly be one of the best anime I've ever watched in my life.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story of Clannad is set in a Japanese city, with the majority of it taking place in the city's high school.  Clannad is pretty much similar to Kanon (2006), which is also produced by Kyoto Animation.  They both start offwith character introductions in the early episodes, and later the story is separated into different arcs that focus on one character or a group of characters.\\n\\n\r\nTomoya Okazaki, the main protagonist of Clannad, is known for being a delinquent throughout his school.  A frequent slacker and a straightforward person, which at some times others call him rude for that, Tomoya is truly a delinquent.  But after one fateful encounter with a girl, Nagisa Furukawa, who randomly says \"anpan\" on his way to school, Tomoya's life is soon to be changed.  And so begins Clannad, a story that shows how valuable having a family can be.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nClannad's main cast is what truly makes this anime a spectacle.  They're all likable as you advance through each episode and each one of them are very unique.  Traits such as Tomoya's hilarious straightforwardness, Nagisa's lighthearted, yet literal, attitude, Kyou's tsundere personality, Kotomi's airheaded cuteness, Tomoyo's assertive attitude, and Fuko's cold, yet funny, approach towards others are enjoyable throughout the series.  Needless to say, the supporting cast is also great.  From Sunohara's stupidly-funny cockiness to Nagisa's dysfunctional, yet very caring, parents, the supporting cast of Clannad is one of those that ACTUALLY support the main cast and they do a great job with it.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\r\nOnce again, Kyoto Animation does what it does best.  The art and animation is truly superb in every aspect.  From moe girls to the many different facial expressions throughout the series, KyoAni truly did a great job with Clannad.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI'm not too fond of scoring sound, but Clannad did a pretty darn good job with it.  The characters' VAs really suit the character they're voicing.  The music is pretty top notch as well.  They did an excellent job choosing the music for the comedic, light-hearted, and dramatic scenes.  However, I wasn't quite attached to the opening and ending songs.  Sure they show how Clannad is, but I just could not get myself to enjoy them.  They are, however, memorable and unforgettable though.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAt first, I never thought I would get into the story since the reason why I wanted to watch this was for the comedy, but ironically, the story eventually drove me to watch this anime.  Even the characters kept me enjoyed and urged me to watch more since they're such a unique bunch.  It's nice blend of comedy, drama, romance, slice-of-life, and a little bit of harem thrown in there, truly made this anime an enjoyable experience that's never to be forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nScore Breakdown:\\n\r\nStory- 10\\n\r\nCharacters- 10\\n\r\nArt- 10\\n\r\nSound- 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Clannad is a series that you should not pass down.  It does everything in the right places, from the comedy to the drama.  Looking at it for the first time may deter you, but guaranteed, there's something in that anime that will make you enjoy it.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: This review is solely based on the first season and not taking into account AS.\r\nClannad. Oh Clannad. Being a highly acclaimed and well-known show for its capability to bring out its emotional aspect on board alongside the genres of comedy and romance, the prime question remains\u2026does it work? My answer is simply, no. \r\nOne of the main issues regarding the harem genre is that the harem genre has never been a proficient or innovative genre when coincided with plot and characterization, and has never been delivered synergistically. Mixing these together just does not work well. The vast majority of the harem genre shows sufferfrom having poor characters, most notably, bland protagonists slaying all, if not, 90% of the girls in the show. With poor characterization, it also comes with ineffectually written over-emotional and melodramatic scenes to accompany the lackluster story.   \\n\\n\r\nGiven the fact that this anime was based on the original visual novel plot, there was not much plot to progress with. The anime attempts to blend together characters with a somewhat different back-story, despite this, they are predetermined and preordained to follow the harem-lets-stick-to-the-main-guy-character-route. All in all, this deems them nearly impossible to determine their own futures regarding romance and their love relationships. \\n\\n\r\nDespite having Kyoto Animation working on the visuals with a high budget and great production values, a studio that has always lived up to my expectations and impressed me vehemently kept me impressed especially with the beautiful and neat design of the ambiance and environment the anime revolves around. Contrastingly, the moe-designed looking characters, fundamentally the female cast, ended up being a defect to the stunning art of the ambiance and environment. \\n\\n\r\nAt first, it was extremely difficult for me to get used to this different design. The character designs are also repetitive and uncreative to the point where 3 of the female casts (the 2 Fujibayashi sisters and Ichinose) have the same coloured hair, purple. Not only this, but the 0_0 design of eyes for every character disregards any possibility for any character to have their own unique distinguishable features. Let\u2019s have everyone go bald, can\u2019t tell who is who now huh?\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s at this point where I think, there are a lot of better shows out there that would be superior and more sublime with this amount of budget.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also as bland as milk and you could even call this an understatement. First and foremost, we have your typical archetype generic harem lead Tomoya. He is also known as a juvenile delinquent who is best friends with Youhei Sunohara, the guy who gets his ass kicked everyday with a known fixed 0% chance to end up with any girl ever, forever a virgin. The amount of domination and pain experienced towards Sunohara is more than superfluous, is it really necessary for him to get beaten up all the time to the point where a ridiculous number of montages of him getting beaten up can be created? Surely, all the austerity and sternness, most notably from Sakagami, is not necessary? \\n\\n\r\nAlso, why would a delinquent, Tomoya, be motivated at the start of the series to help all the other girls? For example, why would he help a girl he just met with a project?  After all of this, it is completely evident that the story is just a overused concoction of plot conveniences and harem clich\u00e9s. Few of the characters receive much development to be frank. It\u2019s especially difficult to find this show emotional at all given that most of the cast, notably Ichinose, Fuuko and Nagisa sound roughly half their age. Being the lolis as they are, they try to exhibit radiant qualities and traits, but only end up failing miserably. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was to say the least, decent. Emotional musical pieces, mainly dominated instrumentally by piano were used during tragic scenes while relaxing music was used during joyful scenes. The ending song \u201cDango Daikazoku\u201d resembles to the theme of family and friends, something that has changed Tomoya into a better person. Some of the osts were used too repetitively, making them less memorable than they should have been. Osts such as roaring tides were also used well evocatively to strengthen emotional scenes but only being hindered by the monotonous character designs. As a prerequisite to every episode, the opening is beautiful solely for its visuals, portraying all the participants of the Tomoya harem one by one consecutively along the well-sang evocative and euphonic music. \\n\\n\r\nClannad could have been a much better show without the use of unrealistic, unoriginal, and monotonously designed characters to fit into the exemplar generic harem lead. All their insecure and childish natures deem taking these characters seriously or by heart entirely impossible. If you are a fan of harems and moe, I can ensure you will have a higher chance of enjoying Clannad. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you come into here with the thought of being evoked or touched with realistic drama here rather than over the top melodrama occurring, you probably will have little enjoyment. If you think Clannad is realistic in anyway, you will probably end up unable to stay sane. Despite all this, ultimately, Clannad does show more of a intrinsic and natural warmth that many near-harem type shows do not have. \\n",

            "content": "Clannad is an anime that I had low expectations of going into because of the character design/art style, but it has proven to me that, out of all the similar looking anime I have seen, this is the best. If you like anime, you'll like Clannad. The characters all bring the show together nicely and it is definetly enjoyable; I am exited to start Afterstory.\r\nPlot-7/10- One thing i commend Clannad for is having supernatural aspects that are nessasary to the plot, but not nessasary for the enjoyment of the show. The show would still be good if it stayed in reality, but the supernatural stuffmakes a solid base for the plot. It branches off to show the story of a certian character without excluding the others for its episodes, and there are good endings to these branches that show the saddness and happiness the show can bring together. There were a bunch of little climaxes instead of one big one, so the ending didn't feel like an ending for me. I'm counting on Afterstory for that.  Its stays a comedic and happy anime that made me laugh out loud a lot while hinting at things that are very sad, and also more serious stuff like the existance of pocket dimensions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-8/10- The characters are what drive this show. I appreciate that one can see how the family situation of each character affects their personality, most of the characters have roots of their mind that we can trace back to their parents, which is the case in real life. The word Clannad means family in Gaelic so family is a prominant part of the show. Clannad has possibly the most creative rendition of a ghost i have ever seen, who is really just a normal person that is halfway between existing and not existing, whith nothing creepy or over the top about it. Some of the lines in the show are brilliant, as Fujibyashi and Okazaki are very witty. I just didn't totally love the show's characters like I can do sometimes, so although the characters were pretty much flawless for that type of show, so i give them an 8.\\n\\n\r\nArt-5/10- at first glance, the art is not that great. They do some nice things with it though like the lighting in a room and the cgi of the lonely world. The Dongo theme was animated very well in a different style than the main show. The fact that each of the characters have different coloured hair so we can more easily tell them apart is a flaw, but i can get over that. The art isn't really that good or bad.\\n\\n\r\nSounds and Cinematography-5/10- The pacing of the show was good, those shutter lapses i am so used to seeing on Microsoft Powerpoint surprisingly didn't bother me because they made for good pacing. The cuts to the lonely world were shown and timed perfectly to show that this is more than just a funny show. Other than that the cinematography didn't stand out. The music and sounds were decent, they had a handfull of songs that they would replay and would fit the mood well. I didn't like the opening theme but it wasn't too bad. The ending theme was very good reflected the mood of the show, with the line at the end \"all that is happy and sad rolled into one\" (rough quote) sending home the show's mood.\\n\\n\r\nRealism Within Unrealism-7/10- the main squabble I have with this is when Sonohara is beat up he will always land in a tree or go flying ect. The show exaggerates some scenes for comedic effect, which can be funnier but it takes away from the show. Otherwise it is completely fine for realism. At first I was going crazy about how the characters were being secretive about Fuko, because she would be an extremely important find for researchers. As it turned out though, there was a branch of the story that involved researchers involved in the supernatural aspect of the show, so I was satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-7/10- Its not my favourite show, but i could see why it would be someone else's. No matter what type of anime you like, give this one a watch!\\n\\n",

From the outstanding story, the beautiful art styles, the way that the music was implemented, the character development and back stories that were thoroughly satisfying I found almost nothing to complain about in Clannad. This is the type of anime that will make you go from tears to undeniable happiness in a matter or 5 minutes. Clannad is without a doubt one of the best visual novels in the last decade or so, and I believe that watching it is an experience that everyone needs to have intheir life.",

            "content": "I'm gonna be honest. The only reason I watched Clannad was so that I could eventually get to Clannad After Story which everyone seemed to have deemed the best thing since slice bread. While the second season did not live up to this reputation or my expectations, the first season was certainly just as bad as the MAL reviews claimed it to be, if not worse.\r\nIn the beginning, this show had potential. Sure, the school setting may have seemed repetitive, but the characters looked pretty and quirky enough to be interesting and have actual backstories and personalities. Turns out I was wrong. And very muchso. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the first couple of episodes reminded me of Angel Beats due to their combination of slice-of-life, supernatural, action, and school settings (as well as the occasional joke), this all quickly faded away into oblivion. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters that were initially introduced were never developed. They hardly did anything interesting, ever. The only character who actually seemed to \"do things\" was Tomoya, and these \"things\" usually consisted of meeting new girls and interacting with them. \\n\\n\r\nSince Clannad is based on a dating sim game, I understand where this format is coming from and how it  could work there. The player chooses a girl and then her story unravels in one way or another. However, since this is an anime and you can't really choose anyone (though even if you could I probably wouldn't bother), these girls just all randomly come into the picture and never seem to get out of it. They offer no funny jokes, unique personalities or clever dialogue. They're just... There. Weird smiling / blushing / frowning blobs that all \"care\" for the protagonist in some way or another even though most of them hardly know him. However, we don't really know him either, since, as I said before, he hardly ever does anything other than trying to talk to these purple-haired blobs who are always surprised and amazed by everything that comes out of his mouth. \\n\\n\r\nSince the characters in this anime are practically non-existent (I mean they're there, but I wouldn't go as far as calling them characters) it's no surprise that so is the story. Sure, one of the girls wants to start a theater club, but by the time that becomes apparent, so many pointless interactions (and episodes!) have passed that you can hardly remember what it was we had all come here for. \\n\\n\r\nThe supernatural aspects of this show also hardly make any sense (ok, so they're revealed in the second season, but I honestly shouldn't have to wait 40 episodes to understand something so trivial), as do the totally lame pet boars and starfish obsessions. \\n\\n\r\nAs if the weird hair colors, pets, and \"sneak peeks from the other world\" weren't strange enough, the art itself is also pretty odd. While the girls are all apparently designed to fit the \"moe\" (aka bland, pointless cuteness) criteria, the guys just look weird most of the time. With huge eyes and unnatural haircuts as well as odd hair colors, it's really hard to take them seriously. (But then again why would you? It's not like they actually have a personality or anything worth discovering or learning about, so...) \\n\\n\r\nIt is perhaps for this total lack of motivation or personality that even the voices of the female characters sounded annoying.  Seriously, all they do is go \"Huh?\" \"What?\" And \"Tomoya-kun!\" Consequently, I thought that Yuuichi Nakamura might be the saving grace of this mess since he's one of my favorite seiyuu, but even this kind of failed. Clearly, there's only so much you can do as a good voice actor if there's hardly anything for you to voice... I mean, with no personality and no story, what can you really talk about and act out?\\n\\n\r\nSince another redeeming quality when it comes to anime is usually music, I was hoping that perhaps this might make things better, but even this ranged from completely mediocre (at best) to outright bad. Both the opening and ending themes were boring, bland and entirely unremarkable (just like everything else about Clannad) while the background music was just disastrous. The main theme sounded like something out of a sci-fi movie made in the 90s and was just as awkward to listen to as the fake moe voices or the strange  pet boar noises. \\n\\n\r\nMy guess is that the music was taken from the game too, but honestly, an anime is NOT a game and I wish the creators had understood that. Trying to transfer a game directly to an anime format without making too many changes made this show pretty awful (at least for me) and extremely tedious to watch. For a show with no plot, no other interesting aspects and basically no redeeming qualities, it also lasted WAY too long and therefore gave me way too many excuses to just look at my phone or do something else. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I would never recommend Clannad to anyone, I think that there might be two settings where watching this show might be remotely bearable:\\n\r\n1. If you've played the game before and enjoyed it, hence know and love the characters. \\n\r\n2. If you're playing a drinking game and have either already lost or will soon lose the ability to be rational as well as make good judgments.\\n\\n\r\nIf neither of these categories apply to you, then you're probably better off doing something else. Unless of course you're a masochist or simply don't care about the advise caring people have given you. In that case... Whatever floats your boat. \\n",

            "content": "Casual, yet dramatic. Emotional, yet light hearted. Clannad is renowned in the anime community as an emotional, heartwarming, masterfully executed slice of life production....\r\nDoes it live up to its reputation?\r\nWell, as perhaps THE most classic example of a show tailored to getting through to the viewer's emotions; i have a lot of respect for this anime: and it did indeed deliver for the SoL appreciating part of me. The mainframe of this show is the character development, as opposed to the chronological plot line.  This is essential for anime productions such as Clannad, as it thrives off the viewer's attachment to the characters.\r\nThe showbegins a touch too slowly, and so this reinforces the fact that the SoL genre will deter many - in fact, it is one of the most dividing genres out there. Though, Clannad is presented phenomenally. It doesn't take long to gather the delicate, casual, heartfelt and charming essence that the story brings about.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the story, our lead character meets each of the main female characters; and in a flurry of emotional and casual connections; their back story is directly implemented into the story-like substance of the show. This is the general formula for anime dependent on back stories: it bares AMPLE similarities to Little Busters! (my favourite anime series). \\n\\n\r\nEach character seamlessly merges into the limelight, one after the other - it's a show of discovery, understanding and emotion. While some may dismiss this as cliche, i can assure you that Clannad brings about a refreshingly easy-watching atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nAs you watch through the show, you'll essentially be manipulated into relating to the real world issues that each individual character faces. While warming to them, this is where Clannad strikes: by utilizing its talent for conveying emotional struggles and repressed feelings. It is an emotional and friendship driven show after all, and while it will see sensitive viewers through rough patches, it consistently manages to change its own pace, essentially taking any and all viewers through part of the emotion-o-coaster at some point.\\n\\n\r\nEmotions? That's it?!\\n\r\nWell, not exactly. Although the show isn't made to suite the taste of selective action-fans, it spans into a variety of genres... Using some supernatural and more upbeat SoL devices, Clannad can further be considered a romance and a comedy (at minimum). While this lives to divide viewers, i personally find the coverage to compliment the refreshing, vivid presentation of the show, as it brings about a fresher and less manufactured outlook on life.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize other elements...\\n\r\nThe story, while simple, is effective, as character development takes precedence in this case. The art is vibrant, and the sound is very meaningful (once you understand), which bodes well with the vividness of the show as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude...\\n\r\nClannad (though it's not made to suite all) is a charming, delicately and vividly presented journey into the heart of a group of vibrantly contrasting girls, that will see you through a multitude of emotions, as it makes use of sentimental details and story telling techniques to live up to the heartwarming tale it turned out to be for me.\\n",

            "content": "I have always been drawn to tragic, sad stories. A story that can evoke a lot of emotions and touch one's heart tends to leave a stronger, lasting mark for me. I watched Clannad because I knew of its reputation in the anime community, and that's why I was so eager to finally experience the story for myself. To say that I was disappointed to find out it wasn't my cup of tea is a bit of an understatement.\r\nI love drama if done well, and I'm no stranger to slice-of-life stories with or without romance. Unfortunately, the drama in Clannad was handled in an overbearingway. It lacked subtlety. You, as the audience, are made aware of the oncoming collision so when it finally hit you, it feels more like a nip on the leg rather than a severe body trauma. \\n\\n\r\nBut if I were to pinpoint exactly where Clannad lost me, I'd say the biggest culprit is its characters. I didn't feel any connection to any of the characters at all. I loathed the moeness and whenever a character does something so stupidly cute, it's all I could do not to stop watching. To be clear, I have nothing against moe characters. It's just that in Clannad's case this \"moe problem\" detracted a lot from my enjoyment and it seriously contributed to my overall detachment from the story. This is a minor snag but I also didn't find the character design appealing and I don't know about you, but this anime deserves a harem tag. Ok, I'll stop nitpicking now. \\n\\n\r\nInterestingly, I liked the father figures better. They represented qualities that I craved: A complex character in Tomoya's dad and a mature one in Nagisa's. I admit Nagisa's dad can be childish, but it makes his mature moments all the more powerful. I actually wanted to know more about Tomoya and his dad because it is when they are interacting  that I get quite emotional. Sadly, Tomoya never gets his backstory but maybe we'd see more of this in the After Story? Please, say yes.\\n\\n\r\nI know this review is negative, but it's not my intention to diss those who loved Clannad. I tried so hard to love it and even though it has its moments and it generally improved in the latter half, I'm still perplexed by how different my viewing experience is from the majority.  I guess people do have different tastes and I'm one of the party poopers this time.",

It even surpasses Suzuka and Ai Yori Aoshi.\r\nThe series follows Tomoya Okazaki a third year high school student who hates his life.  Things begin to change when he meets Nagisa Furukawa, she's recovering from a illness and spends most of her time alone.  They become friends and slowly change each other lives for the better \r\nThe story was great with the early plot revolving around Ibuki Fuko who wants to give out starfish to everyone.  It's a sad yet heartwarming story.  The overall plot revolving around Tomoya and Nagisa wasgreat.  The series blended together light humor, romance and drama perfectly.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were simply perfect.  Each brought something to the series, and helped me enjoy it even more.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation done by Kyoto Animation.  I haven't to many of their series, but this one was amazing.  The animation really brought the characters to life for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was great, though it wasn't outstanding. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, like I said the best romance anime series I've seen.  This series is a must see.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Where do I begin with this. When I first saw Clannad it popped up in a search for different genres of anime that I was interested in. I got into the first episode without knowing a single thing about Clannad, I didn't look at any overviews or synopses on Clannad, I didn't even know there was a visual novel. Anywho, so I get into the first episode and while watching I'm thinking okay what's so special about this? At the time it was nothing but I decided to continue on, and at the end of the first episode I think is this going to besome magical show? Well it does become one in a unusual sense (but I'm getting ahead of myself). So I start to get more interested in the show because I started showing some relation to a few of the characters and their personalities. Clannad is definitely a one of a kind anime/visual novel, I say this because the way the creator's made their characters and gave them their traits was astounding. They didn't give the characters any unrealistic goals, they didn't give the females unrealistic body figures, the male characters weren't always talking about breasts (I know that's not with every anime but in a good portion of animes dealing with high schoolers there is a lot), they created the characters to be like just about anybody else out there, which is one of the big reasons I got hooked. There were some fantasy like things that occurred in the anime, which gave a good feeling to the story. I like how they included a legend/myth about the town and how it comes into play a few times actually. The artwork they did on the anime was really good as well, it didn't feel choppy, it was clean drawing (it didn't feel like anything wasn't as good as it should have been.). The music that was mixed in with the anime as well made it feel like it really went with the story, the music didn't feel out of place in other words.",

            "content": "Clannad is undoubtedly very popular amongst the anime community. Based off of a visual novel by Key (NOT A HENTAI), Clannad is a 2007 anime series from Kyoto Animation who are known for their adaptations of previous Key works such as Air and Kanon among other popular shows. Out of the three, Clannad is arguably the most popular.\r\nThe story is one of the weak points of the show. It's based off the tried and tested visual novel formula that people probably should have been sick of but aren't. The lead character befriends a group of girls that all just happen to have pasts filled withmisfortune and decides to help out these girls because a) He has also has a checkered past b) He wants to get in their pants or c) all of the above. Tomoya falls into category A due to the fact that it's based off of an all ages visual novel. Just like most of Key's work, it provides an interesting spin on the formula but not enough to make it feel natural. Everything still feels very processed, The tear jerking moments are sad at first but when when I re watched the show I found myself cringing rather than crying.\\n\\n\r\nThe dramatic effect is heavily reliant on the visuals. Although it makes it feel even more processed, they were definitely right on focussing on this to enhance the effect. The animation is fluid and natural while the artstyle is detailed and cutesy. This is probably the best looking show I've ever seen. But I'd expect no less from Kyoani. After all, they are the studio behind Haruhi Suzumiya. The eyes are big, the noses are non existent and everything is shiny. Say what you will about the show's quality, but there's no denying that they put a lot of work into the art.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the show fits every scene perfectly. Knowing just the right heartstrings to tug at. Once again, it's just another method of manipulating you but still nice to listen to regardless. The thing about the music I like the most, however, is the use of songs from the series as background music. There's even foreshadowing of songs that don't get introduced until Afterstory. The English dub is for the most part not very good. Luci Christian is wonderful as Nagisa but pretty much everyone else is miscast. Sunohara sounds like a nerd rather than a delinquent, Kyou sounds like a middle age woman and Tomoya sounds too bland. They do a very good job with the comedy scenes of the show (Some of them are even funnier) but the drama really suffers. The inconsistency of the script is also to blame which means some scenes are lost in translation . It's not an awful dub but I would only recommend the dub to newbies and those who really oppose subs (If sub haters exist). The original language track is the only way to go otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a slightly stronger point with varied personalities and fun quirks and traits. There is, however, a familiar feeling with a majority of these characters. They're all based off of characters from other works of Key. FOr one, the protaginist Tomoya bares a striking resemblence to Yuichi and Yukito from Kanon and air respectively. In both appearance and personality, they're basically the same. The girls are no better based off of character types commonly seen in Visual Novels and anime of similar genres. Ryou is clumsy and awkward, Kyou is a tsundere, Mei Sunohara is the token loli, the list goes on. But despite the fact that they're based off of character types, they're quite an enteratining bunch. And even though their back stories are woven together in a less than fluid fashion, they still have some interesting stories to tell.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I liked Clannad a lot more than I thought I would. At the start I still hated it but as the show progressed it got better and better. Even when I rewatched it  and the drama showed its manipulative side, I still thought it was a fun and funny highschool comedy drama. A good show (As indicated by the 7) that's definitely worth a look. I also recommend watching it just to see the sequel, After Story. But that's something for later.",

            "content": "First impression:\r\nAs my first romance anime I had next to zero expectation to Clannad, since I picked it up as a change from mecha/action. \r\nThe intro really made a big impact on me, the music, animation and colors are well timed. The opening song is sweet yet with a feeling of energy.\r\nAfter the opening song you get introduced to several main/support characters. With a splendid use of humor, animation and BGM I&rsquo;m left behind with a small yet solid knowledge of what awaits me in the future episodes. \r\nThe ending song is cute and simple animated, not quite my taste but I&rsquo;m sure I belongto the minority here.\\n\r\nGreat episode, I&rsquo;m hungry for more.\\n\\n\r\nFew episodes later&hellip;\\n\r\nThe main focus is on Fuko (one of the main girls), a rather mysterious girl who hangs out with Tomoya (protagonist) and Nagisa. It becomes clear to me that Clannad is divided up into several arcs but I&rsquo;m not sure what the main plot is about. It doesn&rsquo;t matter though, since the characters really deliver the entertainment, so I&rsquo;m tagging along.\\n\r\nAround episode 10ish Clannad shows its true potential. The arc of Fuko culminates in such a manner that swept me away; I couldn&rsquo;t believe that I didn&rsquo;t foresee the outcome.\\n\r\nEven though I&rsquo;m a newcomer when it comes to romance, school-life animes, I&rsquo;m now sure I&rsquo;m watching a big giant in this genre.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nIt revolves around Tomoya Okazaki, a male student who believes himself as a delinquent. He is very helpful and shows good understandings of other people. Throughout the show he meets several female fellow students, who in one way or another need his presence.\\n\r\nThat means the show is build up around the girls in the opening and divided up into the following arcs, and Tomoya interacts with them one by one and hopefully ending with one of the girls.\\n\r\nThe main story is plain and simple, but it is the background stories of some of the characters that show us the depths.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nI&rsquo;m surprised how well made the &lsquo;insert-scenes&rsquo; are. The correct word for it is yet unknown to me, but scenes like Tomoyo kicking Sunohara or Kyou ranting around the guys are hilarious (like when she gets embarrassed or mad). There is many more and every one of them delivers.\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are well used to add up the effect of particular scenes, the animations and the colors are made with lots of efforts and are a great joy for the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe sound in Clannad is outstanding. It creates a great atmosphere and becomes in one with the animation. It could have been great with another opening and ending song throughout the show, but nevertheless both of them are very catchy. After a while the ending song grows on you, so you can&rsquo;t stop yourself humming to the tune.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nEach of the main and supporting characters is very colorful and full of life. It is hard not to be fond of them, but on the other side they are very static. Meaning after a few episodes you don&rsquo;t get surprised by their actions anymore, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter in this case, since you just want more and more screen time with your favorite character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nFrom hilarious jabs to tearful events, Clannad has it all. Great animations full of colors and details, amazing voice acting and amusing dialogues blended together with gloomy background stories are great tools to make the theory of relativity to come true. You lose the sense of reality and get surprised how fast each episodes pass&rsquo; by.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nThis show is the new benchmark when it comes to romance, school life. I got this feeling that Clannad is rather a melancholy than a happy series, but when the show masters all the aspects of &lsquo;what an anime should be&rsquo;, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter in the end. \\n\r\nStunning voice acting and perfect interactions between the characters are the corner stones of this show.\\n\\n\r\nWatch it if you&hellip; \\n\r\n&hellip; are nothing more than a normal anime fan. You don&rsquo;t want to miss this one. \\n",

Many people seem to LOVE Clannad, I guess I'm the oddball who thinks its just a generic romcom harem show with a bit of drama.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nNot bad,but very very generic. The drama club arc was good, but Fuko's and Kotomi's arcs were just pointless fillers in my opinion. Other than that I also enjoyed the comedy episodes , but on the other hand some of the drama was kind of stupid.\r\nArt 7/10\r\nEven though it's done by KyoAni, the animation is just average quality. Sure the characters look cute, and the show overall is very colorful... butits nothing outstanding, to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNot very much to say about this, but the music is good and fits the show well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the worst part for me. I didn't really like the characters that much.\\n\r\nTomoya was fine,though he suffered from the \" chick magnet without a reason syndrome\" It wasn't that bad but,he was just Mr.Nice guy helping all the girls.\\n\r\nNagisa....well wasn't horrible,but she had annoying crybaby moments.\\n\r\nFuko and Kotomi were just......uhh how do I say this..... retarded.\\n\r\n (Seriously, a girl who thinks about nothing but starfishes and a \"genius\" who can't introduce herself properly...)\\n\r\nKyou and Ryou were pretty cool. They reminded me a lot of the Hiiragi twins from Lucky star. I actually liked them.\\n\r\nTomoyo was also a pretty good character,she wasn't annoying at all. Sadly she didn't get too much attention.\\n\r\nNow, Sunohara and Mei were probably my favorite characters. They were so funny, and it they didn't get boring at all. The episodes involving them were the most fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters aren't too horrible, but the show focuses more on the characters I don't like,so I guess it's just bad for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEven though the Fuko episodes nearly killed me,there were some fun episodes that were a joy to watch. (for example the episode where they played basketball) I  liked the comedy,romance and slice of life parts of the show. The drama didn't interest me that much,but it was pretty emotional.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7(maybe 7.5)/10 \\n\\n\r\nClannad was a good show. But not a super amazing masterpiece.\\n\r\nTo me it was a pretty generic,but enjoyable romcom. It was a very nice story,but I just didn't see whats so special about it.",

            "content": "Clannad: An Anime Romantic Comedy At It's Finest\r\nIt's really a shame that you don't see more romantic comedies done as well as Clannad in the anime industry. From beginning to end, I found myself laughing, smiling, and crying at everything that was going on in this series. \r\nI found the strongest aspect behind this series was the characters. There really wasn't one single character I can say I despised. I absolutely loved the lead character, Tomoya. He had a great personality for someone who is considered a delinquent, but also kind-hearted at the same time. Yuuichi Nakamura was a perfect casting for his character andI'd say this role might have propelled his career to play other notable male protagonists, such as Alto Saotome from Macross Frontier and Oreki Houtarou from Hyouka to name a few. Overall, I found all of the female leads to be extremely likable. Nagisa, Kyou, Fuko, Kotomi, and Tomoyo were all interesting, unique characters. What's funny is the best part about this series is while on the outside it seems like a harem series, it really isn't. There really isn't that much of a love conflict between the girls for Tomoya like you see in many series nowadays. There are quite a few moments where Tomoya does bond with each character, but it doesn't feel like a forced romance. There is some tension present, but it's very minuscule and it becomes obvious later on in the series who the main love interest is. Even the characters I like to consider \"main supporting\" like Akio, Sanae, and Youhei were strong driving points, from mostly a comedy standpoint but also the dramatic standpoint as well. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, I found it to be solid but not without its faults. The basic start behind this story is Tomoya despises the city he lives in due to a tragic series of events. These events occur off-screen and are just forced exposition to the next event. It doesn't help that I don't think the series got off to the best of starts when Tomoya meets Nagisa for the first time and finds out she's repeating her senior year after missing an entire school year due to an illness. I found it kind of flawed, mostly because the writers didn't make it very clear as to what illness she had. Overall, I found the entire first episode to be a little too vague with its character backstory, for both Tomoya and Nagisa. However, despite this rather forced start, I found the series rebounded quite a bit as it progressed and covered some of its tracks it missed early on. This series was extremely character driven and the overall story revolved around how Tomoya's character changed due to the relationships he formed his senior year of high school. While this series struggled to portray backstories, the present characters more than made up for it.\\n\\n\r\nAnother factor I found to be a strong suit for this series was the sound production. I really enjoy a series when the music and tone can set the mood perfectly. I give major props to Shinji Orito for the music composed for this series. It certainly didn't hurt to get the perfect performer for the series OP. Lia became pretty well known for her performance for the Air OP and also went on to do the OPs for Clannad: After Story and Angel Beats! as well.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there are a lot of great things to say about this series, I did feel it had a few flaws. As I mentioned before, I found some of the character backstories to be rather vague. While I wouldn't say it completely ruined the series, I did also find the \"tragedy\" theme to be rather forced among all the lead characters. It seemed as though each and every lead character had some sort of forced, tragic backstory. While I found the Fuko arc to be endearing, I also found it to be rather \"out-of-place,\" especially considering there wasn't exactly a proper explanation as to who or what she is (trying my best not to spoil it). While I consider this more of a personal preference than a flaw, I'm not a huge fan of Kyoto Ani's animation style during the mid-to-late 2000s, with Clannad being no exception. Most specifically, the character designs. I'm not a huge fan of how the facial designs are on their characters...however, I cannot necessarily call that bad animation because it is more a personal preference than an animation flaw. There was one minor plot point that wasn't completely covered within the Clannad storyline and that had to do with the off-story dream sequences/Nagisa's play, mostly revolving around Tomoya's involvement. I won't spoil it, but it didn't feel like it was completely elaborated upon. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Clannad is a touching romantic comedy that seems to balance everything out extremely well. There are great comedic moments, touching dramatic moments, and even a sweet romantic buildup to boot. The scriptwriting and characters were downright magnificent in this regard. This series has just about anything you could ask for in a romantic comedy. While I wouldn't say this was the best romantic comedy I've ever seen, it is definitely one of the best and I highly recommend this series to anyone looking for a good laugh and cry.",

            "content": "This anime is an adaptation of a visual novel of the same name produced by Key Visual Arts studio. Clannad takes you through the school life of Tomoya Okazaki, a troubled teen who's idea of attending class is showing up at lunch, then sleeping the rest of the day away. The show incorporates all main arcs of the visual novel into one comprehensive storyline that builds and develops wonderfully on itself. In fact, the writing behind this anime is what makes it a masterpiece.\r\nThe writing is such that as the story progresses, you will progress along with it. You will feel emotion along with thecharacters, which can be quite immersive. Expect to laugh and develop fond memories during this anime as if the characters were your own circle of friends. Also expect to cry, possibly harder than you have cried in years. If there is one thing that Clannad is exceptional at, it's making people cry. \\n\\n\r\nIn summation, the artwork is fantastic, there is a character for everyone, and it really is a work worthy of highest regard. The the powerful empathy invoked by the brilliantly tailored story will forge a psychological pairing with the music that will last you a lifetime. \"Dango Daikazoku\" and \"Onaji Takami E\" are two of many pieces from the anime that still bring tears to my eyes. Watching this anime feels like more than watching a show, it feels like a window into your own inner feelings, and in many ways feels like going home.",

The way the story was told was so interesting, so captivating, so real... This is an anime that is a definite must-see for fans of the genre!\r\n[Story (score: 10)]\r\nClannad's story is magnificent. First of all, it starts in a rather cliche, yet unique way. The main protagonist, tomoya, meets the female heroine, nagisa, right off the bat, just like most cliche romance anime. However, it takes a dramatic turn from there. As the story begins to develop, clannad makes sure to include the traditionalcomedy, slight romance, and drama that other, common romance anime include. However, that's just the surface. Clannad provides more than just a slight tweak of that simple, commonly followed template. It mixes in tragedy, sorrow, bliss, and creates an emotional potpourri that all watchers will enjoy. Thus, I have given it its rightful score of 10.\\n\\n\r\n[Art (score: 9)]\\n\r\nClannad's art is quite a visual treat, among other things. It's one of the better illustrated anime, and that's clearly visible as the anime progresses. The characters faces and personalities seem to compliment each other and add to the realistic feel of things. The settings are wonderful as well.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound (score: 7)]\\n\r\nI personally did not like clannad's OP, although some may disagree with me. However, I loved the \"big dango family\" song, simply because it was so... interesting.\\n\\n\r\n[Character (score: 10)]\\n\r\nThis is where the true beauty of clannad lies - its characters. They are depicted extremely well, from sunohara youhei to akio, all the characters have fitting personalities and back stories that will draw you into their own world. Saying anymore would be a spoiler, but I'll say just this: clannad's character cast will leave some kind of imprint on you, good or bad is up to you.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment (score: 10)]\\n\r\nA very enjoyable anime, one that will move your emotions in ways other anime can't even compare to.\\n",

I had began to watch this once but couldn't grasp the supernatural messages behind the MS, but I was young and to watch it again and understand it - Thank god I did, that's all I can say.\r\nStory:\r\nTo sum it up, it's a soft harem - and by soft I mean it isn't overpowering and typical like most. MC is surrounded by girls and that one blonde, funny, male friend. MC helps girls with problems but these girls have pressing matters. Their storiesare quite deep and meaningful - actually - and strut on the edge of cry-worthy each time. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing worth mentioning, is that instead of side stories with a female follower ending abruptly and returning to the MS, the sub-events give more depth and development to the main story and to the character progression which makes it flow.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe MC is an undercover nice guy. The girls range from Shy - Tsundere and everything in between. The back story of each character isn't too mainstream but I found I was predicting a lot of the time (not necessarily a bad thing). \\n\\n\r\nThe girls all carry development, but in particular I think Tomoyo stood out the most for me. Her aggression and passion to be seen simply as a girl was endearing. \\n\\n\r\nFuko - the little first year that hangs around Tomoya - her story was absolutely touching!\\n\r\nNagisa's parents have a skit each time in the bakery shop which never failed to amuse me. Her parents are comedy worthy but when they get serious it hits major feels. \\n\\n\r\nTomoya is laugh worthy, cry-worthy, swoon-worthy, mad-worthy and that doesn't change for After Story either. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, this is an anime that just needs to be watched. I may have found things that picked at me along the way, but I took it as a journey, because at the end of it, I wasn't complaining about a thing.... probably because I was so excited to start After Story.",

            "content": "The definition of moe has been argued over for many years. Is it a pure form of feelings toward a female character without it being sexual? Is it borderline loli with a dash of kawaii? Well look no further than Clannad, the definition of moe in anime form.\r\nClannad follows the story of Tomoya Okazaki life at school, in which he meets and gets to know Furukawa Nagisa. He eventually meets many other girls similar to Nagisa, in which he finds out their backstorys and their dreams for the future, as well as trying to confront the girls problems, and his own.\r\nFor the story, Clannad contains5 arcs portraying the lives of each of the characters. It can be said the plot is character driven, as most of the story is told by the actions of the characters. The atmosphere is at many times lighthearted, with many jokes and puns prevalent in most episodes. 1 fact that needs to be addressed is that this is a serious harem anime, filled with romance and kawaii (cute) moments, which are filled within each arc. Although the atmosphere can be lighthearted, some of the themes can be quiet dark, some themes include guilt, depression and death. However, it's main positive is taking those themes and making it into a more slice of life. The anime does well in demonstrating how the characters cope with their problems in their designated arcs, and even though their past can be very hurting, they still get on with their lives when it comes to school. The ending was a typical harem ending, which was coped with well.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, although the premise of the show is positive, it does have many flaws which ruin the series. Some of the more emotional moments can be over sensationalized, which leads to characters almost forcing tear jerking moments. Furthermore, the arcs themselves, although at some parts detailed very well, some lack any real substance and can be see as filler episodes. Lastly, although the comedy comes at the right times and are enjoyable, sometimes it can be too overused, and leads it to be boring. Unfortunately, these flaws are too consistent to not notice.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, it truly is breathtaking. Some of the scenery is so well done I feel like it fits well into the idea of scenery porn. The brilliant contrast of sunsets are stunning, with fluid like movements and fine detail. However, the nail in the coffin comes from the character models itself. Their eyes scare me. Unfortunately, the models look really cheap and lack any really importance. The use of moe designs in the anime are not a favorite of mine, however, they do make some moments cute and nice.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, it can really be a hit and miss. Main character Okazaki is a nice blend between not having an easy going life and still being kind and considerate. The problem is that, other characters have problems which can become annoying, for example, Furukawa has a extreme guilt complex, understandable at times yet forced too. But Sunohara acts as one of the best comedy relief characters that has a back bone, which is truly refreshing. Furthermore, the cute interactions slow the pace of the plot down too much. Nevertheless, the story revolves around character development. The past is narrated by the characters themselves, with the emotions dealing their problems very much real.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, both the opening and ending cater to kawaii end of the music scale, both I thought were decent but not fully to my tastes. However, the original soundtrack was incredibly moving, I really enjoyed the moving music, and it made the experience watching it slightly more appealing.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Clannad is famous moe/harem anime at its best. But I found some parts stale with side order of boring. However, I do recommend Clannad to those new to drama anime's, as it is a good starting point and a good reference as to expect.",

            "content": "Okazaki Tomoya is a delinquent but he sure is friendly. One day, he finds a girl who surprisingly mutters \"anpan\" (sweet bean bread) to cheer herself up. Little did Okazaki know that Nagisa would be his partner in years to come. Clannad is a really touching anime which has comedy, drama, romance as well as a slice of school life.\r\nStory:\r\nClannad is basically the story of what Okazaki experiences in his school life and the tragic stories of his friends. It starts off with fun and happy times that has lots of comedy in it to make you laugh. Then, it gets sad and climaxes tothe extent that many will cry. There are also lots of twists and unexpected events that happen along the way. There is also another world which has a parallel timeline to the real world. I will not elaborate too much or I might spoil the anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThough some say that the eyes of Nagisa is outrageously large, viewers will soon get used to it. The art is fine and the background is really breathtaking especially scenes with the sun setting behind the characters. Most of the characters are cute too(especially...well all of the girls are cute so...). There are also some special effects like the blue light seen from Tomoyo kicking Sunohara. Everything in Clannad looks quite realistic as compared to other animes.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis is my favourite part of Clannad! Each and every tune from Clannad's soundtrack suits the scene perfectly. The tunes greatly change the mood of the viewer. The tunes will be etched in your mind after hearing it. I find myself humming and whistling the tunes so often after watching Clannad. The opening of Clannad is ok but Dango daikazoku is really nice! I strongly recommend viewers to watch the ending even after an episode has finished. This is because when you have just watched a touching episode and Dango is played, tears will just well up in your eyes. Even after I have watched Clannad a year ago, listening to any tune from it just brings back happy and sad memories of Clannad. A definite 10 for sound!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nEach character is really well crafted and you will bond with the main characters really fast. It makes me feel as if they were actually real people! There is a diverse range of characters. There are the childish ones(Fuko), the vicious ones(Kyou), the shy and quiet ones(Nagisa, Kotomi and Ryou) and the playful ones(Sunohara). The characters all have unique personalities which just make Clannad even more realistic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nClannad really makes you laugh and then makes you cry so easily. I really enjoyed watching this anime as the mix of comedy and tragedy is just perfect for it. Rewatching Clannad makes you laugh even more when you first watch it because you will already know the personality of the characters. It gave me a sense of nostalgia too. It is also not overly funny as too funny animes may not be enjoyable as there may not be a good plot in it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nClannad is an epic anime with touching elements. It has comedy, romance and a slice of high school life. Clannad is one of the best animes I have ever watched and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it. It doesn't matter if you are a boy or girl, young or old. This anime really pulls people's heart strings and I really urge YOU to watch it!",

            "content": "Ah, Clannad, another copy paste by sir Maeda, poorly. \r\nSometimes, I've hope for animes who take a wrong start, because It could be better later, I guess. But here, the atmosphere is the same during all the godamn 23 episodes, an atmosphere a way too slow for that kind of stuff. School life is already an difficult kind of show to make, because it quickly fall into clich\u00e9s. So, with Clannad, we got a combo of all the errors you need to dodge to make a good anime. Let's get started so, enough of free insults without arguments.\r\nAt the beginning, few month ago, I wasthinking of Clannad and his sequel like the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of japanimation, a chef d'oeuvre without any equal, a masterpiece of animu. But after some re-watching ( and viewing of other great animes ) I come to the conclusion that is just overrated, nothing else.\\n\r\nAfter all, it's like all key/maeda animes, the same story, the same overrating. Look at AB, for example. Who the hell it is rated 8.50 ? This thing doesn't worth 5, because it's too short, too anarchic, too fast-paced and there's a way too much bullshit in the end. And here, same problem, without the supernaturel side ( or not ). Maeda has a big problem with scriptwritting : this is always the same context. This is the same melo-drama high school atmosphere, the same male protagonist who seems inexpressive, the same female protagonist who's shy and got some serious illness, the same retard sidekick who's constantly the casting's punching ball. And this is always the f*cking same tearjerker, and shit, that's quite boring. I'm not against forced drama ( 'cause I'm a pussy ), that's why I like AnoHana or Shigatsu. But it mostly introduced at the END of the series, unlike maeda's shows where you're constantly about to tear bust. And made of tearjerker a main argument of watching is not a very very good thing, you see ? Because when you start criticizing it, people are like \"it's so sad, how can you say it's bad ?\" and so, the debate become sterile. \\n\\n\r\nBut well, let's talk a bit about the story in itself.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 4\\n\r\nI love theater. I'm actually practicing it and I enjoy it as hell. But here's, theater is just a fake selling argument because except some few passages and the ending, this thematic is totally absent. Yeah, there are scenes where they're trying to do it but it's just to show some moe discussion. The reality it's that Clannad is not a theater show with some drama, it's a drama-moe show with some theater and that's very sad. Sad because it's exactly like Shigatsu, the show is not focusing on music but on drama. And that's why I found the story of Clannad totally devoid of all interest. There's absolutely no originality  in the school-life part, all of the scenes are just scenaristic fragments of others series, nothing else. Another big BIG default is the lenght of some parts, like the Fuuko arc. Who, in this universe, give a single god damnit shit about some frickin' wood starfish, WHO ? This part is during almost 5 episodes, 5 EPISODES IN A 23 EPISODES FOR SOME STARFISH. Plus, it's was totally useless, except for the protagonist who gain some sympathy at the viewvers regards because \"ohhh, he's helping everyone\" and well, that's creepy...\\n\r\nAdd the get-out-of-nowhere fantasy context and bingo, you got some shitty story, yey. Uuuuh, like I don't want to spoil you guys, it's better if we stop shooting at the ambulance now, don't you think ? \\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\r\nWell, moe animation. Some people are scared out byt those BIG eyes but well, that's not my case. I actually kind of like the character design, and the way to draw of the studio in general. I'm not a big fan of moe, ecchi and all of those weebs shit but well, it's agreable I must recognize. But If you don't like it, just look at those sceneries ! Just look at the encounter of Nagisa and Tomoya at the first episode. Cherry blossoms blooming, petals twirling, beautiful ! The animation is fluid and nice but the tears seems fake, a really bad point to an anime who's trying to make ya cry like a little girl.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 5\\n\r\nOk, legit here. Legit because I hate that opening but love at an unimaginable point the ending ( this is one of the cutest thing I've ever heard ). And what about the ost then ? Well, Maeda is an excellent composer, not good as Yuki Kajiura or Nujabes, but still very good. But in a sens, I love some of the musics and I hate some others, that's very unbalanced. But in general, there's a good utilisation of musical themes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3\\n\r\nTo settle things, I love the Tomoya's character. He's one ( not in my top but still ) favorite male personn of all japanimation because of his coldness and attitude in general, the extrem opposite of Sunohara ( that I like too ). But for the harem ( lol ), god, I'm suffering. Nagisa is an absolute clich\u00e9 of weak girl who's doing her best. I kinda like her look and voice but damn, she is so naive. Kotomi is stupid, drop that f*cking violin before my ears get rape one more time. The twins are ... well, twincest anyone ? Not some shoujo-ai there but well, Kyou is a bit like the coleric seme and Ryou the shy uke, pretty disturbing. Fuuko is a bitch, end. Tomoyo is an interesting character but well, she's not developped at all, badly. And the best character is obviously Nagisa's father. He's hilarious but mature, a bit like a higher level Sunohara ( less stupid too ). But well, his presence can't just delete the accumulated garbage by the harem-shit girls. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4\\n\r\nI like it sometimes but I found it too slow and unbearable more often. \\n\r\nSome parts are really sweet and worth watching, some others are just cancer for eyes and mind.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4\\n\r\nClannad is a bad anime. Not bad for his defaults, but bad because it's dishonest. The anime is trying to hide the evident lack of ideas by placing some theater element and that's very sad. Because If you it throw out, Clannad is just a melo-drama romantic school life story, like a tons of others before. I guess people are liking it mainly because of the after story, but well, if it was less bad, it wasn't perfect at all. \\n\\n\\n",

With a touching story, beautiful animation, lovable and memorable characters, and the unique talent of making the watcher laugh and cry at different intervals, this anime is definately worth watching one time or more. This anime gives to its watchers what other animes rarely can; it places the characters into real-life situations that could happen to anyone at any time.\r\nBy far, this is one of the best animes ever made and, personally, I don't think I will ever love another anime as much as Clannad.",

            "content": "Clannad was said to be Key&rsquo;s longest game with over 8 times the text of Kanon and 4 times longer than Air.  However, one should not compare Clannad to Air or Kanon, as they are very different in tone and story.  In addition, the overall tone of the story and characters are close to the anime version.   Air is distinctly a tragedy and Kanon is the definitive nakige (crying game) so there is an overall sense of sadness and pain in both of those titles.  Clannad on the other hand is more upbeat and much happier and very funny.\r\nThe comedyaspect of Clannad is easily one of biggest drawing points.  In fact, most of the scenes I remember the best are the comedic ones.  In comparison to Kanon&rsquo;s  (KyoAni version) comedic parts Clannad has far more and in general funnier.  This shouldn&rsquo;t be too much of a surprise as Clannad&rsquo;s mood was far happier.  I would love to see KyoAni do a &lsquo;Fumoffu&rsquo; version.  However, Clannad is still a romance/drama and it does get serious at times.  Overall though, the series retains a very happy atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what impresses me most is the way KyoAni handled the adaptation.  Clannad is a visual novel with several distinct routes and this has often caused problems when adapting it to an anime.  In addition, Clannad doesn&rsquo;t have multiple male protagonist (ie ef ~a tale of memories~, Myself; Yourself) nor is the director crazy enough to split the main character in 2 in such a popular title (Kimikiss got bashed quite a bit on 2ch).  Clannad solves this problem by making Nagisa (the main girl) a major character in most of the routes.  So instead of the male lead jump from one arc (girl) to another we have Tomoya and Nagisa go together from arc to arc.  This way we can see the natural development between Tomoya and Nagisa.  Compared to Kanon (KyoAni version) this was a definite improvement, where the romance between Ayu and Yuuichi felt extremely forced.  Although Nagisa does conveniently disappear for an episode so they can focus on the Kyou/Tomoyo routes.  At first I thought this was a weakness on the part of KyoAni, in the end I became lenient in this regards as the nature of their stories are very difficult to do with Nagisa.  In addition, Tomoyo also seemly disappeared for much of the beginning and suddenly reappears midway.  This on the other hand is something I simply cannot forgive! *waves Tomoyo fanboy flag wait I can&rsquo;t forget my Kyou flag and my Nagisa flag and&hellip; \\n\\n\r\nWhile Clannad does have an arc story structure the flow between the arcs are done very well.  Instead of jumping from arc to arc, it felt like each arc was part of the natural flow of the story.  The fanboy inside me wishes they spend more time on Kyou and Tomoyo however, I&rsquo;ll have to admit they did effectively tell their stories, just like the rest of the cast.  My main complaint would have to be the fast pacing of the earlier episodes.  Perhaps I just got used to the fast pacing after a few episodes, but I though Clannad would have benefited by slowing down the beginning.  I think KyoAni originally planned on cramming more the Clannad story and have the after story within 26 episodes.  This should explain why they ended on ep 23, well 22 if you don&rsquo;t count the extra episodes, and announced that they are going to animate the after story separately.          \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, they distinctly follow your typical archetypes but it isn&rsquo;t as blatant as Kanon or Da Capo.  In general, I found them quite charming and lovable, from Sunohara&rsquo;s crazy antics to Kyou&rsquo;s awesome bouts of tsuntsun and deredere.  In addition, most of them are well developed, in particular Tomoya and Nagisa.  Those two have grown the most and their relationship grew in a very realistic manner.  As for the way the characters interact, once again, extremely fun to watch.  However, most of the interactions were between Tomoya and the girls.  I would have like seen more interactions between the other characters as this does give it a more harem feel.  \\n\\n\r\nKyoAni doesn&rsquo;t forget about the technical aspects of Clannad.  As expected the animation is very sharp, vivid, smooth, and very consistent.  Art is also on a similar level, with beautiful background and detailed characters.  I&rsquo;m quite happy they didn&rsquo;t completely follow the character designs of the game, unlike in Air or Kanon.  As I&rsquo;m not very fond of Itaru Hinoue&rsquo;s art, the main character designer for the game.  In my opinion, the art of Clannad the anime is far superior to the CGs of Clannad the game.\\n\\n\r\nClannad has a very happy tone and feel to it.  This is characterized by the laugh out loud comedy to the heart warming drama.  You won&rsquo;t cry from sadness, as in Air, instead you&rsquo;ll cry tears of joy.  This is because something so funny happened you&rsquo;ll tear up or something so incredibly heart warming happened.",

            "content": "Recommended to us by AnimeKoala on Twitter, Clannad is an anime I\u2019ve been aware of for a long time, and for it\u2019s Visual Novel even longer. Even when I wasn\u2019t consuming anime, had heard about this anime, maybe not specifics like if it was good or bad, but just passing words here and there. And now some 7 years later, I was recommended the show and am now finally able to sit down and really view it and take it all in. To be honest, I had only heard amazing things from this show, it has an 8.2 on MAL, and it\u2019s received critical acclaimfrom everywhere you look. So yeah, my expectations were based upon this show being in ways, and out of body religious experience. The fan base for this show is rabid, and they love it, but now that I have completed season 1 of Clannad, I want to view this anime in a completely different, I want to view this anime as, that\u2019s right, an anime. I really want to understand this show and where it\u2019s coming from and hopefully we can all learn one important life lesson from this review, which will be at the end of the review portion of this anime. So thank you to AnimeKoala for recommending me Clannad, and if you have a recommendation then please put it in the comments below, I\u2019d be more than happy to take a look.\\n\\n\r\nBackground\\n\\n\r\nClannad is based off the visual novel by KEY released in 2004 on PC and then on Sony\u2019s Playstation and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox 360 in 2008. The in 2015 also received an english port to Steam over 10 years after its initial release. The game was then adapted into a full 23 episode anime series in 2007 by Kyoto Animation, and has since then seen much success even receiving an English Dub, which at the time was a bigger deal than now. The anime series follows roughly the same set of circumstances as the Visual Novel by key, although things are changed to make the anime flow better and not be an over 40 hour mess of plot and characters. The anime was directed by Tatsuya Ishihara, who is known for anime like; Air, Amagi Brilliant Park, Chuunibyou and various other anime. He is mainly known for working on Kyoto Animation projects, but worked on others like Pokemon.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nOh where do I start here, first things first. This series is beloved, it is so beloved there are people who I am sure, will argue it\u2019s the greatest anime ever made. In fact, I am sure some of you watching are some of those rabid, imbedded into the fandom, Clannad fans. Which 100% totally fine, but sadly this anime is just\u2026 well it\u2019s bad, very few qualities in this show are redeemable, and the story is not one of them. Let\u2019s get into one of them right away. Tomoya is described as this \u201cdelinquent\u201d a couple times throughout the series, yet he shows literally now qualities of this. Not only that, but the only showing of his character in this whole series is that he cares for people and will help him. But what makes it even worse is that the show will like to tell you he is this delinquent every so often. This writing doesn\u2019t make sense for not only his character, but for the story as well. I am told Tomoya is this guy who does bad things, that he is this guy who isn\u2019t responsible. But from the get-go he is responsible, he doesn\u2019t do bad things, sure he may not treat his father well, but by the end of the series that takes a complete 180, even though they only interact a few times throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nBut that is just one small problem this show has, the other is its incredibly convoluted and hard to follow dialogue. You see, I watched both English and Japanese and I could not tell the difference here. The show just had really bad writing, I felt that either characters were immediately jumping to conclusions making the dialogue seem either forced, or just outright lazy. This doesn't do any favors for the show as it\u2019s primarily based upon characters and developing these characters for these crescendo moments, which come with no fanfare at all. I never felt like any of this show outside of only three episodes were important to me. I felt like I was somehow on the outside looking in or even worse like I they were only giving me just less than enough to properly follow this dialogue. I felt like I was honestly missing something and it drove me insane trying to figure out the circles these characters were talking in some times. I honestly don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a show with worse writing in my whole life, and to see this from Kyoto Animation of all studios is confusing. If I were a betting man, I\u2019d say something went wrong with production behind the scenes here. There is no way this show shouldn\u2019t have been as good as it has been touted.\\n\\n\r\nBut another element of this show that really made me mad, was the harem tropes and sudden shift in genres at times to fit these tropes. Why in the hell in the second half did all of these girls suddenly fall in love with Tomoya, Even a pair of sisters fall for him. It felt so forced and by the next episode it was completely dropped outside of a few mentions here and there. The show is so inconsistent, and if we\u2019re talking about tropes let's talk about how people abuse Tsunehara. He is the token \u201cannoying\u201d character in this anime, and he gets abused by Tomoyo, not to be confused by Tomoya but then again even he abuses him too. But this show seems to try and teach this lesson that if you have an annoying friend you should just beat the ever loving crap out of him for no reason. Is Tsunehara annoying? Yes, but not enough to physically pummel the guy into oblivion. Sure, he does sexually harass verbally Tomoyo in one episode, but at the same time that\u2019s treated at the end as \u201coh haha, look ain\u2019t this a silly scene\u201d. Honestly it\u2019s kind of disgusting the way they treat his characters and not only that it\u2019s lazy and bad writing.\\n\\n\r\nBut speaking of physical abuse, let\u2019s talk about the comedy. It doesn\u2019t play a huge part in this show by any means, but is featured pretty regularly throughout the show. And I must say, it\u2019s not the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen. But some of the most annoying elements of this show are trying to either be played off a \u201ccute\u201d or \u201cfunny\u201d and neither of them hit the mark. Sure I like some moments like Tsunehara being told there is a cute girl only to run to the door to just see his sister and fall flat on his face out of sheer disappointment, but other elements like Fuko popping up out of nowhere to add not only nothing to the scene at ALL, but to then to help no one even though she says she\u2019s come to the rescue. They do this maybe 4 or so times and every time it\u2019s annoying as you\u2019d expect. Fuko also had the slowest and most boring arc in the show that went on WAY too long and even then she is still shoved down our throats because\u2026 \u201cMoe\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also has a little bit of a problem with telegraphing some pretty important stuff or just simply having small moments being overreacted to. Let\u2019s take for example in episode 20 when Nagisa\u2019s dad tells Tomoya that if he finds any info on Nagisa that he should not tell Nagisa. This completely telegraphs exactly what it is, which I won\u2019t tell you here. They could have easily gotten around to it as it pertained to her parents that they could have just had Tomoya naturally go to their parents. For example, it\u2019s like finding out that your girlfriend\u2019s dad was the inventor of the door, naturally you\u2019d go to your girlfriend\u2019s dad, not your girlfriend. Then this show has a problem with overreacting to many things. For example in episode 18, Nagisa gets hit by a fastball and sure those hurt, but EVERY SINGLE PERSON has too look aghast and in shock and all call out for Nagisa at the same time. It came off as lazy and like the show really wanted to get across like this was a huge dangerou thing that could have went wrong, but they kill that idea off when everyone just stands around and does nothing besides Tomoya. \\n\\n\r\nBut I\u2019ll give the show some credit now, and it isn\u2019t much so cherish this fleeting moment. Episodes 13, 14, & for the most part 16 are all really fantastic well written episodes from to back. In this case Episodes 13 & 14 are probably some of the better writing not only in the series, but what I\u2019ve seen personally in a little while. Something about those two episodes flow really well and are touching and relatable. Nothing crazy in them happens in terms of tropes or Tsunehara getting assaulted, not even Fuko tropes and outdated jokes. Episode 16 is good because of the second half really which is just a basketball game, but they do such a good job of not only building up to the game, but how the game plays out and the climax of the episode. It\u2019s not perfect per se, but it\u2019s some of the best the show has to offer at this point, it\u2019s also fleeting as these are the only good episodes. Yes, that\u2019s right, out of the 23 episodes of this series, there are only three episodes that I can find not good but memorable in any way. Everything else feels like a copout or just bad and the ending of the show doesn\u2019t feel earned at all. It feels like they stumbled into the ending because at that point it was 23 episodes so just end it. It honestly just felt like a terrible representation of all the great things I\u2019ve heard about the visual novel. \\n\\n\r\nCharacterizations\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to say this show had good characters, I\u2019d be straight up lying to you. Because honestly the characters here are rarely built up in a way that are distinctly memorable besides Kotomi and Fuko, and that\u2019s mainly because their arcs are so long. Tomoya too for him being the MC which is an obvious one. But the show rarely gets to a point where I feel these characters are presented more than \u201cjust another moe girl\u201d. This is manly because the cast is primarily just cute moe girls and nothing else, and to make matters worst three of them have similar colored hair. I actually was confused for a couple episodes because I thought I missed something when Kotomi showed up and on of the twins, the tsundere one, started acting sexual around her. And yes, that\u2019s another thing Kyou acts so sexual around Kotomi and it\u2019s not warranted. She\u2019s either wanting to rub up against or is rubbing up against her in the show. Funny? Not really. Uncomfortable? Kinda.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll give some of it credit though, Kotomi\u2019s arc was really great and really let her character flourish. Learning about her backstory and how she came to be was very heartbreaking and made me sympathize with her character a lot. More so than any other character to be honest, and that\u2019s another point I want to make. I can\u2019t relate with anyone besides Kotomi. Fuko is a ghost of a living person trapped in a school, Tomoya is a delinquent, but he\u2019s not. Tsunehara is to strange to be a real person. These characters don\u2019t feel relatable, it feels like they could solve all of their problems with ease. Kinda like they have the tools to really wrap this show up in 6 episodes instead of 23. When you\u2019re making a show, you want to make characters relatable, this is so we can recognize their struggles better and sympathize with them. It makes their stories easier to get across to the viewers and helps you notice certain things so that later on it doesn\u2019t have to be explained. This show doesn\u2019t really do that. It\u2019s just a bunch of cute girls and a guy who says he\u2019s a delinquent, but in reality is a wholesome guy. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I\u2019d like to say is that these characters are annoying, incredibly annoying at that. Fuko popping in with her \u201cI\u2019ve come to rescue the day\u201d shtick, TomoyO\u2019s whole abusing Tsunehara, Nagisa\u2019s dad pissing off her mother and chasing after her to apologize with a mouth full of food were fun the first time or at least the first time they were used well within context, but any other time it was used was annoying and made the show even slower. Sure some of these things on paper could possibly work out well, and they had some good things going with these ideas. But to cram them in over and over was really just unnecessary and quite boring really. \\n\\n\r\nOverall it\u2019s a mixed bag the shows characterizations. There are some noteworthy moments here and there but they\u2019re constantly fleeting as the show is nowhere near as consistent as it needs to be in my eyes. Yes, Kotomi\u2019s Arc was great, at least the last two episodes of it, and sure it has it\u2019s moments from time to time. But for the most part this show\u2019s characters would be forgetful if it wasn\u2019t for their character designs and drilling these certain things they do into your head. I won\u2019t be forgetting Fuko anytime soon, but it\u2019s not because I like here, it\u2019s because she\u2019s annoying and has not only the longest arc in the show, but the most annoying recurring joke throughout.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nAlright finally I can praise this show for something. The art here is incredible and while it is a little outdated and looks rough at many points throughout the show I can still get a lot of enjoyment from this art. The character designs are are phenomenal and unique. Obviously with it being Kyoto Animation they tend do a lot of \u201cmoe\u201d centric shows like Kannon and K-ON. So the characters here fit that bill and remain consistent with past Kyoto Animation works. Characters adorable, but it\u2019s anime so that\u2019s a standard trope throughout the genre itself. I also find how their eyes places and drawn are unique too. I\u2019m not sure how to explain it but they\u2019re bigger than regular anime eyes and they don\u2019t use the same thin face type you\u2019d regularly see in anime. Instead Kyoto goes for wider faces and a more rounded head if that makes sense. To me this makes the characters stand out as \u201cClannad\u201d rather than just another generic anime girl/boy.\\n\r\nAnother thing I enjoy about the art for Clannad is how ridiculously detailed it can be. For example, Fuko\u2019s wooden starfish sculptures has small imperfection marks and little round indents on the front of them. This kind of detail is all throughout the show in every episode. The icing on the sweets in the bakery, the small town they live in\u2019s backgrounds, small things like these really let this world come to life through visual world building. I felt like this place with a real town somewhere in Japan. This is why Kyoto Animation is in the position they are, their art is extremely detailed and unique. So if you\u2019re wondering if Kyoto does wonders with the art here, you will love this show if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting\\n\\n\r\nAlright back to trashing on this show, both Japanese and English versions are TERRIBLE. The dialogue is all over the freakin\u2019 place it\u2019s so hard to follow. One moment they\u2019re talking about something and then the next moment they change immediately creating a clunky and overall abrasive kind of dialogue and voice acting. There is a lot of talent in both versions so, I think the script was just jumbled up from the start and they probably just took scripts directly from the game and threw them together in a desperate hope that it would work, but sadly it does not. This right here though is the one thing that killed the show for me completely. I could forgive the lackluster nonsensical story, I could, but when you take something as easy as an English Dub and ruin and then you take your original version it\u2019s based off of, and ruin that there is literally no other way to watch this. It doesn't matter with dub you pick, what language you speak, it\u2019s all bad, and sadly this just killed the show. And to add onto that I like some of these voices a lot, but Tsunehara, Mei, Kyou, I could go on were miscast completely. Mei being honestly one of the most egregious of these.\\n\\n\r\nScore\\n\\n\r\nAnother great thing this series has, arguably to some the best part of this series is the score. The music is done by Shinji Orito who has worked on; Air, Kanon and Little Busters. His style here thought really shines through. To start off it has this gentle feel throughout, with the Dango Daikazoku song serving as the shows main theme which is featured throughout most of the series. This score is so beautifully crafted, and the reason for this is because these songs aren\u2019t over produced or even featured a lot. It\u2019s very minimalist scoring in the sense that you won\u2019t really notice it unless you want to or unless they want you to. And when they do want you to really notice it, it can really make you wonder what this show would be like if it didn\u2019t ruin it with the story and voice acting. But we also must talk about the opening and ending and I must say they\u2019re some of the best opening and ending songs I\u2019ve heard. They\u2019re well performed and they fit the theme of the show. I know some people hate it but I also like the ending song a lot, the song Dango Daikazoku isn\u2019t really memorable outside of it being a catchy nursery rhyme kind of song, but the version in this show is really catchy and is a really good song.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Rating\\n\\n\r\nAlright, I get the love for Clannad, I really do. It\u2019s a show from a beloved studio based on a video game that arguably put Visual Novels on the map for today\u2019s Visual Novels like Steins;Gate and Doki Doki Literature Club. But it\u2019s sad to say this because I really wanted to go into this show and be blown away, I wanted to love, I wanted this to be the greatest thing ever. A Life changing experience that I would tell my children\u2019s children about when I\u2019m old and dying from a broken heart. But I can\u2019t say that happened to me, the show was just bad. I only enjoyed three episodes out of the 23 that are in the standard version of this series. The voice acting was atrocious, some of the worst voice acting I\u2019ve ever heard. Then we have terrible jokes like Fuko\u2019s recurring appearance where she does nothing but hold up the show, and on top of that everyone physically abusing Tsunehara for literally no reason other than because somehow it\u2019s funny. And ya\u2019 know it\u2019s not enough that the art and score are so damn good. It\u2019s not enough when I say that Kyoto really outdid themselves in terms of the detail they put into such little things. But ya\u2019 know what, this series didn\u2019t do enough to begin and end with. It\u2019s a bad anime that on paper should have been amazing, should have been a life changing experience like the Visual Novel supposedly is. But like I said, it\u2019s sad to say this. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s sad to say that Clannad Season 1 gets a 4/10.",

            "content": "Family is a pretty big deal. It is undeniable that the very concept of a family is essential towards the development of an individual. Whether biological or not, whether caring or not, the influence of family will always be in a person. This is especially evident in the youth of a person, a time in which the experience of family is most present. \r\nClannad loves its family. It knows of the strong emotions that such familial experiences hold, whether it be nostalgia or sorrow. It knows of how sensitive the topic of family can be to certain individuals. And it knows that, by having itscore theme revolve around family, it\u2019ll be able to form a complete emotional connection with the viewer and it. As such, Clannad wants to be something meaningful, something beautifully profound. An aching desire to leave an emotional impact on unsuspecting viewers strives in Clannad\u2019s inner narrative. To do so, Clannad will have to carry out its central theme through any means possible. The ranges from many additions in exterior connection with the viewer, such as the inclusion of high school friendships and the naivety of adolescence. The flame has been set by this point, Clannad\u2019s continuously growing desire for depth is what drives its narrative forward. But, in the midst of doing so, Clannad will be blinded by such a desire and forget to do all the in betweens necessary to properly convey a message towards its viewers. Due to this, Clannad will crash halfway through its wild ride and completely shatter it\u2019s ambitions into shards. Yet, Clannad will still be expecting of the viewer to step on those shards to invoke sentimentalities onto the viewer. This essentially leads to a narrative interwoven with inconvincible situations, tiring redundancy, inconsistent characters, disappointment, and dangos...\\n\\n\r\nThe first few minutes of Clannad stand out in terms of quality from the rest of its duration. Simply put, it does what an opening sequence strives on being. In just a short amount of time, Clannad\u2019s opening intro delivers adequate characterization and setting in enough time to let the viewers know what they\u2019ll be diving into. A nihilistic monolog is presented from the main character, Tomoya Okazaki, as he nihilistically rambles on about how he has a melancholic loathing towards his city\u2014 and himself. He does so while walking, nihilistically, in a monotonous world delivered by the stunning visual directing. Upon walking towards a steady hill, Tomoya encounters the main heroine, Nagisa Furukawa. In doing so the visuals themselves abruptly change as color fills the screen with the accompanying blossom of surrounding sakura trees. Tomoya utters a hopeful line contradictive of his monolog to the coy Nagisa and proceeds to walk to school alongside her. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the opening scene onwards, it is clear that Clannad sets itself up to be centered around Tomoya. Essentially being the perspective character, the development of the narrative of Clannad is likewise dependent on Tomoya\u2019s development. With the usage of such a means of storytelling lies an abundance of potential for greatness. This is a cynical Tomoya\u2019s story, the story of his weak, yet hopeful state of adolescence influenced by family matters. An ample reason is given for the viewers to care about Tomoya\u2019s life crisis. Seemingly, he\u2019s what would be considered a delinquent, skipping classes and not giving the slightest care for things. But beneath that characterization of Tomoya lies a desire to change, a desire to live once again the life he\u2019s wanted to live. This, in return, makes Clannad\u2019s chances of failing as a narrative completely slim. I mean, there\u2019s no way you can make a mess of the ongoing building of potential that lies inside the surface of the storytelling. Except you can, and Clannad ultimately does so by biting off more than it can chew. This  results in a complete opening of the narrow chance of failure that later invites disillusionment as to what Clannad is trying to achieve.\\n\\n\r\nIn order to fully delve into as to why Clannad is utterly lacking in its storytelling, some contextual background must be acknowledged. The Clannad anime is a mere adaptation of an already existing work, a visual novel developed by the studio Key. A majority of visual novels tell much of their stories in a nonlinear manner, usually due to interactive factors such as the selection of choices. As such, many visual novels branch themselves into different heroine routes, all told from the perspective character\u2019s view. In them, all the required further characterization and growth for that specific heroine is filled in as the perspective character equally develops more throughout. \\n\\n\r\nAnime, however, mostly has a linear means of storytelling due to it\u2019s more visual format. Completely adapting a visual novel would be a laborious task to do in an adequate manner. In accommodation to this, Kyoani has decided to merge a multitude of the heroine routes present in the Clannad visual novel into one elaborate common route. Clannad branches routes that would have been their own thoroughly developed stories into variable arcs. Yet, it does all does while still having its central female character focus being on Nagisa. Obviously, Nagisa is still meant to be the main love interest for Tomoya underneath all these other arcs, what with all the emphasized focus on her. It is at this point that the accommodations for an adaptation become an apparent hindrance towards its intended effect. For what Clannad\u2019s narrative is trying to achieve in simplicity, these factors make Clannad be unnecessarily convoluted in structure. It\u2019s trying to develop a heroine in a way suitable towards Nagisa\u2019s presence. It\u2019s trying to simultaneously focus on Nagisa during the process as well. It\u2019s also trying to develop its ongoing theme of family, hoping to get some feelings out of the viewer. And it\u2019s also trying it\u2019s best to make Tomoya\u2019s actions more explicable due to the lack of first person narration. An abundance of focus on various narrative aspects is placed for Clannad\u2019s desired achievement as an adaptation, whether they be minor or impactful. In its attempt at trying to be a faithful, yet unique work on its own, Clannad ultimately fails. It misses one of the most simple necessities needed to easily avoid incoherence in storytelling: having a thread that\u2019ll connect all the narrative aspects in one way or another.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, Nagisa\u2019s initial introduction in the series is not the most convincing way in terms of showcasing character. She shouts \u201cAnpan!\u201d in a quirky manner to cheer herself up. She\u2019s incredibly coy and modest, usually being the victim of uncalled for embarrassment. She has an obsession for fictional dangos stylized in a childish manner. Essentially, Nagisa isn\u2019t exactly a textbook example of a well-written female character. Clannad defines Nagisa on a single archetype, and that\u2019s prosperous levels of modesty and shyness. Such a trait is clearly meant to hook in moe fans and those looking for the mythical \u201cfeels\u201d. But, beneath all these deliberate attempts at Clannad trying to form an emotional connection with the viewer via Nagisa\u2019s portrayed endearment, not much awaits in terms of further depth. This isn\u2019t to say no other attempt at making you care for Nagisa\u2019s troubles is made, there are, albeit minimal. She has a charismatic family and a desire to restore her drama club, circumstances are set in place. But, none of these attributes are conveyed in a serious enough way for me to actually care about her possible futile actions. It\u2019s all just sugarcoated with Jun Maeda\u2019s idea of emotional setup.\\n\\n\r\nFor the romance tag that Clannad supposedly has, the handling of Tomoya and Nagisa\u2019s relationship isn\u2019t compelling either. During Clannad\u2019s beginning, the way in which Tomoya interacts with Nagisa is, at the very least, promising. A reclusive Tomoya notices an equally distant Nagisa sitting in solitude under the shade of a surrounding tree, a well-rounded set up for a potentially endearing relationship. Tomoya proceeds to make some small-talk with the vessel of modesty that is Nagisa throughout his days, forming a well and good dynamic. It becomes distinguishably lacking, however, when the mildly interesting conversations they have turn Tomoya\u2019s character into an inexplicable blob of motivations that randomly tags along with whatever Nagisa commends his subconscious to do immediately after the first episode. For instance, the aforementioned desire for restoring the drama club intrigues Tomoya. He wants to be beside the aid of Nagisa in the reconstruction of this lost hope. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the exact reason as to why he wants to isn\u2019t ever flat out portrayed. Sure, one could assume Tomoya is doing this for his own good too, but Clannad never provides me with enough hints towards that definitive assumption. After the first episode, Tomoya just becomes a character who spouts random lines of encouragement towards other people before being a retorting gadfly. Sometimes he shows what could be considered emotions, but I\u2019m sure such instances were the result of a fever dream. Most of the time, Tomoya would be just slightly better than your typical VN protagonist. A complementation towards Tomoya\u2019s character cast via Nagisa\u2019s influence isn\u2019t even portrayed in a way that would be supportive of Tomoya\u2019s actions, making both Nagisa all the more dumbed down due to the result of Clannad being unable to transition moods within Tomoya.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being the main heroine, Nagisa\u2019s cast off as something akin to a background character, even when she\u2019s around with Tomoya. Their interactions aren\u2019t by any means unique in comparison to the other girls who want to get in Tomoya\u2019s pants. With the interactions provided, many of the other heroines would have made for much more distinguishable love interest than Nagisa. Clannad simply doesn\u2019t make Nagisa stand out as the main girl that she supposedly is, and that\u2019s a flaw you can\u2019t just cover up with the mundane conversations of awkwardness that the two have. A simple exchange between Tomoya and Nagisa will, half of the time, involve Nagisa meekly saying something in subtle hopes of Tomoya approving her. Although, despite all this, the surrounding circumstances of Nagisa are in favor of justification for Tomoya\u2019s infatuation. She\u2019s the only heroine whose family Tomoya interacts with the most, which is incidentally built up from his own familial circumstances he\u2019s been in.  But, once again, that is not Nagisa\u2019s character that Tomoya becomes attached to. This just makes Nagisa feel like a separate attachment towards Tomoya\u2019s character instead of giving her a stance. And that does not make their relationship compelling in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nYet, for what it\u2019s worth, an attempt at developing the two is made. The recurrence of the drama club is a significant point in the first season of Clannad. It is representative of Nagisa\u2019s hopes and dreams that she could not have achieved beforehand. It is representative of Tomoya\u2019s desire of wanting to build a new state of adolescence. It is the thematic climax of the first season of Clannad, the scene that all the previous scenes have built upon to deliver that final emotional impact before moving onto an after story. Of course, such a scene would be important.\\n\\n\r\nBut, an obstacle stands in the way of making the restoration of the drama club an effective plot point. The merging of heroine arcs in between Clannad tarnish whatever connectivity and impact Nagisa and Tomoya\u2019s relationship had left. No, not because the inclusion of a new female character catches Tomoya\u2019s fancy or anything ludicrous like that. It\u2019s more because putting greater emphasis on a specific arc puts all of the other, more important goals on the sidelines. An equal exchange to make up for this, however, is not made. Instead, what Clannad strives to achieve with the heroine arcs is based more around further sentimentalities to milk out those tears in you. Powered by Jun Maeda\u2019s Wild Ride\u2122, the arcs are very well indeed what one would consider a crushing experience. A wild, formulaic experience that later amounts to nothing in proportion to their incidental impact and length. \\n\\n\r\nThe division of arcs throughout Clannad can be easily narrowed down into several, sequential steps. Tomoya encounters an eccentric girl coincidentally while being with Nagisa. Tomoya musters up some resolve in him to help said girl, in the process of making sly retorts to them. Tomoya starts observing the girl in a more serious manner, taking note of some random attributes in them. Then, the anticipated drama occurs, where Tomoya will be standing right next to these suffering heroines while having a straight expression in his face. Essentially, the fundamentals that nakige visual novels are built upon.\\n\\n\r\nNow, formulaic aspects in storytelling shouldn\u2019t by any means be discarded as terrible. If used effectively, it can make for an exceptionally developed narrative. Clannad, unfortunately, does not make use of this potential. Jun Maeda\u2019s conceived formula of breaking down little girls becomes a peccable one when the expectations of the viewer reacting in the exact same manner as the first time is put into place. It would at the very least be fine if such a method only existed in one or two arcs. However, it becomes evident that the very formula\u2019s presence can be noticed throughout, not just the arcs, but the layout of Clannad as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the \u201cfeels\u201d formula Clannad so follows involves the usage of scenes equivalent to that of slice of life. Such scenes have a goal in mind; relieve the audience from the possibility of incoming desperation as well as introducing the character. It\u2019s a pretty simple goal which can, in minimal, be reached at surface level. Just show the characters having dynamic interactions that\u2019ll slowly build up on characterization preceding events. Clannad, however, takes a different approach to what could have saved it in in the long run. Instead of actually introducing heroines in an intriguing manner, Clannad decides it wants to introduce its characters with exaggerations of archetypes and attributes. Fuko and Kotomi are the biggest offenders of this. For instance, the singular characteristic of Fuko is her childish demeanor. She\u2019s excessively short, renditioned with a high pitched voice, spouts some endearing lines, goes into trances of cuteness,  and has a liking to starfishes that is akin to that of fetishism. Basically, a child all over. Except she\u2019s in high school. \\n\\n\r\nThe interactions between the characters in the midst of this do not help either. A majority of the time will the progression of the arc be overshadowed by the amount of repetitive comedic dialogue Tomoya and his friends carry out. Half of the time, Clannad\u2019s take on comedy will be having the butt monkey character, Sunohara, fly off into oblivion as we\u2019re expected to laugh at his misery. The other half involves Tomoya getting in situations in which he\u2019s shown as a lovable jerk, such as teasing his fellow classmates before getting hit by his violent tsundere friend. At times, these situations are admittedly mildly interesting, mostly thanks to the amplitude in animation and voice work put in. Although when Clannad isn\u2019t portraying comedy, it\u2019s portraying a hint of what seems to be arc progression. Yet, despite some meek progression occurring, not much dynamism is felt from any of these scenes. Sure, Tomoya aids in the frolicking of classmates while being tagged with a nonexistent Nagisa. But then again, there\u2019s barely enough subtlety to indicate further motivations and characterization. Changes in character aren\u2019t to be expected, resulting in Tomoya keeping that smug personality of his throughout arcs and arcs. The heroines in question that he partakes action with are, incidentally, never redefined throughout the sections of mediocrity their arcs contain as well. This is a flaw that is taken much into effect when a conceivable setting and portrayal of character is essential in some of the proceeding scenes of impact. \\n\\n\r\nAfter having spent an ample amount of time at attempts toward character attachment, Clannad decides it\u2019s time to start breaking things senselessly. The action of breaking Clannad so does is done in an abrupt manner. Clannad treats the viewer as a child as if it were giving them a balloon, only to then pop it right in their face as it expects you to cry and receive something out of the deed just bestowed upon you. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be using Fuko as a predominant embodiment of Clannad\u2019s drama via characters, so bear with me. During Clannad\u2019s SOL, Fuko\u2019s levels of moe are filled up to the brim. You see her carrying starfishes all over the place to random pedestrians. You see her cute expressions being highlighted by her childish performance. At this point, Clannad expects you to want to hug Fuko. It wants you to want to protect her and care about her\u2014 but only because she\u2019s cute and nothing more. As more dramatic revelations come into play for her character, we\u2019re expected to fawn in anguish over the trouble this character goes through. Even though the very troubles she\u2019s facing aren\u2019t highlighted in any part of the character portrayed. It\u2019ll be evident when an instance of this occurs in Clannad, as sentimental music will start playing with an accompanying shift in art direction. There might even be some characters crying or uttering of some lines of supposed depth to really capitalize on those external feelings Clannad expects you to feel. All tied together with the ongoing theme of family. Yet, Clannad was so focused on emotional buildup, that it forgot the necessary narrative build up to even make its ambitions work.\\n\\n\r\nThe aftermath of such scenes furthers their faults when taking into account how much effort was placed into making them impactful. Nagisa, and especially Tomoya, don\u2019t really develop both in terms of relationship and individual character from their aiding of Fuko to Fuko\u2019s breaking point. Not that they were especially active in their involvement beforehand. Dramatic scenes and the ones Clannad does are not ones in which characters should essentially be static afterwards. Sure, they get a new acquaintanceship and maybe a new experience, but beyond that, not much occurs.  Even Fuko, the central character that the drama revolves around, doesn\u2019t change. Yeah, her problems are solved, but she\u2019s still that moeblob that Clannad originally set her as. Maybe she\u2019s more or less moe, but such a trait cannot be observed as she\u2019s put on the narrative bus all supporting characters go to. \\n\\n\r\nThis leaves for the dropping of the ball to be a reoccurring phenomenon in Clannad\u2019s narrative. For instance, many of the SOL of scenes could have used implementation of genuine dialogue between characters. This would\u2019ve made for much clearer motivations towards Tomoya, as well as the addition of more distinguishable characters beyond the trait that pertains to them. Simultaneously, this would have furthered the buildup towards the awaiting dramatic scenes. A more sensitive Tomoya would be more reactive towards the little girls surrounding him. Which in return would have made for more phenomenal development towards Tomoya. The Tomoya in the Clannad anime develops in terms of slowly breaking that cynical core inside him, but nothing more. A more reactive Tomoya would\u2019ve been much more complementing to his character as it would have invoked a desire for Tomoya to want to change himself from the circumstances of those around him. Each individual scene improving Tomoya\u2019s traits more than the last, in the specifics of what each scene thematically revolved around. Additionally, this could\u2019ve also been used on Nagisa with similar influences, making the formulaic structure of Clannad work more towards what it\u2019s aiming for.\\n\\n\r\nAs a cinematic form of media, Clannad is noteworthy in its exceptionality in terms of visuals that detail much more meaning than what\u2019s presented. Simply saying Clannad\u2019s visual directing is top notch would be an understatement. The composition of scenes is arguably one of the best parts in Clannad as a whole, detailing an array of sentimentalities that Clannad fails at bringing with its actual narrative. Transitions of scenes and character dialogue at times are done in a brilliant naturally flowing manner as well, even during the mundane sections of Clannad. On an animated note, the movement of characters is done captivatingly realistically in contrast to the actual characterization beneath. Changes of facial expressions in accordance with changes in characters\u2019 environments as well as body language conveying relationships between characters are a visual treat to watch. The aforementioned Sunohara is a great example of this; just look at any scene he\u2019s in and sakuga will accompany him. Clannad\u2019s visuals are truly one of the few saving graces it has going towards it not being terrible, and honestly, it\u2019s the only reason I\u2019ve kept going for 20 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all my nitpicking, Clannad still managed to gain a thriving reputation. Frankly, it\u2019s clear as to why it's so. All the aspects in the show are made with the deliberate intention of changing the moods of an individual. Not to mention it\u2019s constant fuel of shoehorned-in meaning, it\u2019s easy to see how Clannad would impact the average viewer. What with it\u2019s ramping of effort in every possible way with its drama, easing of the aftermath with slice of life, sensitive themes of family and hope, treatful visuals, and its exaggerated personas of characters. All of Clannad\u2019s attempts towards impact are cohesive in that structural format of superficiality. It\u2019s designed to make you cry, and in that sense its design is noteworthy. Something has to be taken out all of this in the process, though, and that\u2019s an equally cohesive narrative. As of now, Clannad provides a framework of emotions that is devoid of any narrative substance in it. Disappointment is a more proper term for the sentimentality that Clannad left me behind with. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "After watching \"Your lie in April\" and \"Angel Beats\" and enjoying them a lot, I decided to watch Clannad because everywhere I searched, Clannad was number one on their list of sad anime, and it had high ratings on anime websites. However, in one word, to describe what I felt after watching the whole anime is disappointment.\r\nCharacter/Artwork-3/10 Almost every girl in the anime look the same , with just a slight hair color difference , they sound the same, similar to a little elementary school girl ,which greatly lowered my character score. The two main guys in the anime disappointed me too. Okazaki seemed stuckup and annoyed me ,  the other character , Sunohara was okay but I don't think i laughed once after his comedic acts. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10 the music was pretty good, fit the scenes pretty well but that's about it for that.\\n\\n\r\nSadness:2/10- I haven't cried or felt like crying once in this whole anime series. A big disapointment as I went in this anime because I heard it was very sad.\\n\\n\r\nStory-3/10 There wasn't one episode in the series where I wasn't bored. Almost every \"event\" in the anime was so predictable that it lost impact for me. In addition, it's hard to have emotions evoked when you don't even like or have a bond with any of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment-4/10 - Honestly Clannad was a big let down for me, so much that i began to watch episodes sped up 2x, around halfway into the 23 episode series , something I have never done in my life watching anime.  Obviously this anime was not the worst for me because there are other anime that I watched that were way worse but I do not recommend to people that want to watch sad anime.",

            "content": "Clannad is one of the best and well done anime that can be comparable to many of Miyazaki's films.  Clannad is a beautifully made romantic drama anime that it is one of the few anime I may think of rewatching.  Clannad is based out of a visual novel made by Key of the same name.  Like Air and Kanon, it is a romantic comedy drama.  But unlike Key's other two visual novels, Clannad lacks any sexual themes or fanservices and puts more emphasis into the plot and character.  Thus Clannad is appropriate for all audiences of different age.\r\nThe story focuseson the main character, Tomoya Okazaki, who is very bitter and jaded about his own due his strained relationship with his father due an fight he had.  Because of this, he becomes a high school delinquent and felt that his life is completely meaningless.  That is, until he meets up with Nagisa Furukawa, a girl who happens to attend the same high school Tomoya attends.  Eventually, Tomoya befriends Nagisa, but also learns that Nagisa had to repeat her senior year in high school because she of a severe illness she had and her dream was to re-establish the school's drama club.  Nothing else for Tomoya to do, he decided to help Nagisa accomplish her dream.\\n\\n\r\nLike most anime done by Kyoto Animation, Clannad throws in some elements  of moe.  But unlike other \"moe\" shows, moe is not the entire point  of the series.  Heck, I wouldn't even describe Clannad to be a \"moe\" show by my standards.  It's cute, but not overly moe.  In fact, I'd say some of the funniest scenes and the running gags are quite cute.  Clannad has a sophisticated and great storyline and  characters.  I'm pretty sure that some of moe fans may find Clannad to be more enjoyable than many of the moe/otaku based shows like Hayate the Combat Butler!, Lucky Star, and K-ON!\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline is very enjoyable.  The plotline is very complex and straightforward.  It has an appropriate mix of comedic and dramatic scenes.  The story puts into heavy use of different themes such as the importance of friends and family along the pursuit of one's dreams and happiness.  Sometimes, people need to change their dreams to make other people's dreams come true.  And sometimes, people give up their own pursuit of happiness to let others be happy.  Throughout the story, Tomoya have encountered many hardships of Nagisa and four other girls have has befriended and learned some of their sad pasts of each of them.  Tomoya helped them accept their terms of the sad past and helped them pursue their own happiness of the future.  Clannad also shows that the core of family brings people together in times of hardship, even if they aren't blood related (Tomoya fells more like he's part of a family when he is around with the Furukawas instead of his own father).\\n\\n\r\nThe only part of the plot that is confusing is the stuff relating to the Illusionary World, but the parallels to the real world that Tomoya lives in does make more sense in the last three episodes before the extra episode relating to Nagisa's play and the sequel Clannad ~after Story~.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very complex and many of them have their own personalities and backgrounds.  There is a lot of character development due the characters influencing one another as well as a development of a romantic relationship between Tomoya and Nagisa.  For example,  Tomoya started out a jaded, cruel, and pessimistic delinquent who hates his own life and the town he lives in.  During the course of the story,  Tomoya gradually becomes more caring to other people's feelings, dreams, and happiness due to Nagisa's influence on Tomoya and becomes more of a kinder person.  Likewise, Nagisa starts out as a girl with little confidence and friends, but she becomes more confident about herself at the end thanks to Tomoya's encouragement of Nagisa establishing the drama club.  Tomoya and Nagisa not only touched the hearts of each other, but those around them as well.  The emotions around the characters strengthen through out the course of the series, such as Tomoya feeling the sorrow of his friends.\\n\\n\r\nMany of the supporting and secondary characters are great as well.  Sunohara can provide the comical relief after the sad and dramatic scenes.  Nagisa's parents are quite kind, supportive, and cheerful and can be dramatic at some times (particularly when discussing about the pastries made by Sanae).  There are even archs dedicated to some of them as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is beautifully drawn and colorful with detailed and colorful scenery and backgrounds.  The colors used fits the mood and emotion of the scene (darker colors for sad ones, and light tone colors for happier and comedic ones).  The colors used in the animation fits into the calm and peaceful mood to the series\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Clannad is also amazing.  The songs are completely original and they fit appropriately to the comedy and drama.  Upbeat music and fast-paced is used for happier scenes (an upbeat xylophone song is used for some comedic scenes relating to Sunohara and Tomoya) while slower, calm, and gentler songs are used for more dramatic and sadder scenes.  Some of the songs are \"earworms\" that are virtually impossible to get out of your heads.  In particular with the ED theme song, Dango Daikazoku, is quite cute that you can repeat that in your head for a long time.  The song sounds really silly, but unlike other OP and ED songs where the lyrics are full of nonsense, the lyrics of both the ED and OP theme song does parallel to the major themes of Clannad of family, friendship, and pursuit of one's dreams and happiness.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, both the Japanese and English dubs are equally great.  The English voice acting isn't the best, but obviously not the worst.  There are a few things that I personally felt that the characters may sound a bit unnatural at first in the English dub (like Mei, Tomoya, and Kyou), but I did eventually got used to it.  Perhaps the voicing of Tomoya and Nagisa is probably the best performance done by David Matranga and Luci Christian respectively mainly because they put a lot of emotion into the character.\\n\\n\r\nClannad is a nice romantic/drama anime I would recommend to someone who is looking for something that is cute, but not overly moe and otaku-centered.  It is show that is appropriate for everyone of all ages with virtually no sexual themes or fanservice.  The story and characters are well done and have strong and significant themes to the series.  Some people may get shut off by this due to the fact that it is one of Key's works that is too quirky and predictable.  However, if you have the chance to watch this series, you may to very enjoyable with a mix of comedic scenes that can make you laugh and sad ones that can make your cry.  The show is a well-done masterpiece that I could have rated this over the score of ten if possible.\\n\\n\r\n- Review is from my personal blog: http://darkpaladinx.wordpress.com/2010/08/24/anime-review-clannad/",

            "content": "Opinions on Clannad seem to be bipolar; you either love it or you hate it. Whilst I feel the rave reviews for this anime are not justly deserved, I also feel it shouldn't garner as much criticism as it does either. For me, this anime is a living example of average.\r\nI want to start positively before I become more critical and the positives that stand out most to me are the sound and the art, so kudos to the studio for that. The characters are well drawn and some of the landscaping, particularly the sunset are very easy on the eye and aesthetically pleasing. Thethemes were pretty catchy as well - in the quirky way that they were made. While the female characters did not sound anything like the seniors that they were supposed to be, I felt the actors didn't do anything wrong (barring Fuuko) and my qualm is more with the production and directing. I thought Sunohara's and Okazaki's VAs were both very good as they captured both character's personalities superbly.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main problems I have with this anime is how one-dimensional everything is. It spends so much time on trying to create sympathy for its cutesy female characters that it forgets the one thing that all media should be doing: entertaining us. The story (well, if you could call it that) focuses on a young 'delinquent' - although that's probably the one adjective I wouldn't use to describe him - whose boring life drastically changes after he meets a clich\u00e9 cutesy, quiet, innocent girl looking to make friends. This baffled me as if he was supposed to be a 'delinquent' wouldn't he try bullying or annoying Nagisa instead of becoming her best friend and devoting all his time to her? The anime was also very slowly paced and at times I was in two minds about dropping this anime. However there were some interesting twists and turns (E.G Fuuko) however outlandish and strange they were.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were also a major weak-point of this anime. The best characters always have multiple dimensions to their characters whilst also have a relation to the audience, I felt like that was completely non-existant to this anime. Fuuko, while generating a few \"Awws\" from me, actually really annoyed me as she was constantly referring to herself in the 3rd person in an incredibly unrealistic high-pitched screech as well as having an unhealthy obsession with starfish, Kyou was your typical tsundere type and Nagisa was the 18 year old who acted like she was 5. Even so, all this variance in character was pretty much lost once this anime started to take shape as a harem and the \"Mr. Perfect but Average Joe\" Okazaki made all manner of females tumble head-over-heels for him, including both sisters Ryou and Kyou; which disturbed me a great deal. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this, the anime did give me some satisfaction as for a change it was a harem which actually had a resolution with the male taking a female for his own unlike so many others where we never get an answer; much to the dismay of my hair which often gets pulled out in stress. I also particularly enjoyed Sunohara's character and his comedy relief did genuinely make me laugh as he played the failing bully.\\n\\n\r\nIn reality though this anime is nothing special and for me it falls into the doldrums of mediocrity. I wouldn't advise you to watch or not to watch this anime as it has such a wide spectrum of opinions that I don't think it would be fair, so watch it at your own peril as you may become frustrated and/or bored. I'm not sure whether i'm going to watch the Afterstory, i've heard it is alot better, but after this I don't really have any motivation to watch it. It's a solid, average 5/10, nothing more, nothing less.\\n",

            "content": "Story: The story in my opinion was really good. I liked how it started off with the main character in the beginning and watching him live through high school. I enjoyed watching the main character, Tomoya get involved in all these different situations in which he needed to help someone. It starts off with him being a \"delinquent\" according to his classmates, but then he likes helping people and does all he can to make his friends happy. I enjoyed seeing that in a show because it shows that the exterior of a person doesn't define them.\r\nArt: The art style was cute, but wasn't reallythat significant.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music was great. The opening was my all time favorite opening. The outro was beautiful too. I also enjoyed the background music. My only complaint is that the voice acting wasn't as good as it could've been.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are probably the strongest aspect of this anime. My personal favorite was Kyou. She was funny and was the tsundere of this show, but she also had a caring side and always did her best to help her sister. Tomoyo was a close second. She was misunderstood by her classmates and had a side of her that was shy and sweet. The same goes for Tomoya, he had a bad image but was a really likable character. While I liked all the characters, the other two standouts were Kotomi and Sunohara. Sunohara was the comic relief of the show and was fun to watch. Kotomi was the sweet one I always rooted for.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment: For the most part, it keeps you entertained. The most entertaining parts were with Sunohara or Kyou. The only reason I give it a 9 is because there were times when it was dull.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I enjoyed it for the most part. I consider it one of my favorite animes. I would definitely recommend it to those who like romantic comedies.",

            "content": "First and foremost I have to say that I do not understand why the majority of people on this website have given this a 10. You will see what I mean if you decide to read on.\r\nStory- 6\r\nTo be fair, this anime, like many others, doesn't really *have* a story. It is mostly character driven. So, I can't really say much about the story you can't read in the synopsis.\r\nArt- 8\r\nFinally, we have some Key artwork that doesn't make me shout \"OMGWTF IS WRONG WITH HER FACE?!\" In fact, I thought it was rather nice looking, even! Wow! Definitely a pleasant surprise (finally). I thoughtthe most attractive character design was Kyou's. I'm not a fan of the aho-gei but it was kind of amusing to see that both of Nagisa's parents had them, too, so it was genetic, I guess?! XD The backgrounds were nice, I suppose, but to be honest I wasn't really paying attention to them. \\n\\n\r\nSound- 6\\n\r\nI don't remember *any* of the background music so that automatically made me think of it as average. Additionally, I did not like the opening theme as it just sounded \"wrong\" to me. I noticed later on in the credits that it was a remix, which I rarely like anyway, so that may be why. I have not heard the original song, though, which may not be good anyway. The only thing that pushed this one point in the positive direction of average was the ending theme. Was it good? Um, I don't know. But it gets stuck in your head! After a few episodes you will not be able to stop singing it. I would find myself just doing random stuff in my life and singing that damn song. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 7\\n\r\nAs you have probably guessed by  my art comment, I hated both Air and Kanon. So, imagine my surprise when I actually had a bunch of characters I actually liked in this anime! \\n\\n\r\nAkio and (Youhei) Sunohara are both hilarious, though for different reasons. Akio is the doting father who says things like \"Welcome home, fruit of our love!\" to Nagisa, and Sunohara is the dumbass side kick who has some amazing facial expressions.  The male lead, Tomoya, is actually likeable, which also surprised me. He helped with the comedy a bit by facilitating some amusing misunderstandings throughout the entirety of the show. The fact that I can even talk about several different male characters makes me happy, as both Air and Kanon only had ONE male character (worth mentioning), which seriously rubbed me the wrong way, as the whole world seemed to revolve around them.\\n\\n\r\nThe female characters aren't as consistently good as the male ones, but to be fair, that might because there are more of them (of course). I found Fuko to be annoyingly childish with an annoying voice and annoyingly loli character design to match. Plus, her story arch is ENTIRELY POINTLESS. No, really. That isn't my opinion, it's a fact. You'll see if you decide to watch it. Plus, if you take two of the story arches from Kanon and breed them...this is what you get. It is stupidly unoriginal. Then, there's Kotomi, who's storyline I also thought was somewhat pointless and also reeked of Kanon storytelling. She's sort of cute I guess, but she doesn't really add much to the show in my opinion.  (I already ranted about this in my blog, if you'd like to read it. But, be warned, there are spoilers.)\\n\\n\r\nHowever, when Clannad is not shamelessly copying Kanon, it manages to create some good characters. I felt the strongest female character was Kyou, who was both pretty and interesting. The combination of her straightforwardness, protectiveness towards her little sister, and inner turmoil was nice. Next, I felt Tomoyo was sort of interesting at the beginning when her shtick was that she could beat the crap out of you, but she ended up being pretty bland. Finally, there is Nagisa, who isn't particularly interesting, but she is a \"nice\" character. If nothing else, the rest of her family made her more interesting, which is good because they are an integral part of what makes this show good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 7\\n\r\nMost of my enjoyment from any anime comes from how much I enjoy the characters, so, naturally my character and enjoyment scores are often the same. That being said, what I enjoyed most was the comedy (mostly thanks to the male characters), the not-ugly artwork (despite it being from Key), and Kyou. But at the same time, I did not enjoy Fuko or Kotomi's story arches at all, so that brought my enjoyment down quite a bit. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Overall Clannad is good and enjoyable, but does have some major flaws. I cannot fathom why so many people give this a perfect score. \\n",

            "content": "I know that some people might think that a 49/50 point rating is way too high, but hear me out.\r\nClannad is definitely the best drama/alternate reality anime that debuted last fall (2007) season. Once again, Key Studios presents us with a mysterious, sad, but warm and touching storyline. The characters are highly original and imaginative, and nothing is ever too far fetched to believe in. The highly coordinated voice-acting and animation display an extremely solid and nice audiovisual flow. (The work obviously uses a much higher rate of frames per second than most other anime, and this makes the anime incredibly beautiful.\r\nAll the characters eachtook a hold in a place in my heart, and they all seemed to come alive. Watching them go to school, maybe working, playing, or just chatting, was very interesting. Even something as simple as that touched me; simply, simply, simply because they were very nice, kind, warm, and humorous characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe introduction scene dragged me into the story better than any other I've ever watched, with Furukawa Nagisa-san talking to herself, and Okazaki Tomoya-kun entering. And they walk steadily but surely, up along the long, steep hill. Most action anime just portray a guy dying, about to be killed, or already dead; then they run the opening song.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this was one of the best that I could ask for. For a time I thought that I wouldn't like drama anime. Now, I think otherwise. I give Clannad a serious 49/50, one point off just because one or two characters seemed to not hold much personality. However, all the other characters had more character development than almost any other anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is simply amazing, precisely coordinated with the animation and voice-acting.",

            "content": "Love makes the world go round.  Or so it's been said over so many years.  This anime is proof that such a statement is true.  When there is no love in our lives, we stand still and stagnate, our minds wander aimlessly and we end up going either nowhere or backwards.  When there is love in our lives though, the small missing pieces of the puzzle begin to fit together like a grand masterpiece.  Clannad does just that.  It puts the storyline together like a grand masterpiece puzzle, allowing us to watch as it does so.\r\nThis is one ofthe most powerful and exciting anime I have ever seen.  So rarely is there an anime that manages to reach into our hearts, touch our souls, and bring out the inner child within an adult without making us act like children.  It's strange that some of the simplest things in life, or some of the most insignificant occurances such as calling out to a girl talking about anpan can end up bringing about the greatest impacts to our lives.\\n\\n\r\nClannad excels beyond the typical slice-of-life anime in that it bears the characteristics of the typical slice-of-life characters without being overbearing.  It is also one of the best stories that I have ever encountered encompassing many things from anime, to manga and even books.  There were many times during multiple episodes, sometimes multiple times per episode that I would end up laughing so hard I'd give myself a headache.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime also manages to bear some powerful messages for life.  Sometimes they're hard to see, such as how important support systems can be for human survival and how lacking them can be a detriment.  Other times, it comes right out and shouts it in your face such as how families sometimes work.  By the end of this anime, though I knew there was more to come, I ended up virtually begging for it to never end.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is a true life changer and a must see.  I'm sure most anyone would thoroughly enjoy it if not at least get a good laugh out of it.  10/10",

            "content": "Well, this is practically my first venture into the Key/Kyoto trilogy of moe anime known as Air, Kanon and Clannad and since they have no connection with each other aside from them animated by the same production company, based by the same visual novel publisher, and have some of the same traits, I can watch each show in whatever format I want, but why would I want to review Clannad first? I don\u2019t know either. I\u2019m just going to review this first.\r\nTomoya Okazaki is a third year high school student resentful of his life. His mother passed away from a car accident when he wasyounger, causing his father to resort to alcohol and gambling. This results in fights between the two until Tomoya's shoulder is injured in a fight. Since then, Tomoya has had distant relationships with his father, causing him to become a delinquent over time. While on a walk to school, he meets a strange girl named Nagisa Furukawa who is a year older, but is repeating due to illness. Due to this, she is often alone as most of her friends have moved on. The two begin hanging out and slowly, as time goes by, Tomoya finds his life shifting in a new direction.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I know the first thing to say about this and it is\u2026..highly emotional and often very cute and adorable (which is what they also trying to achieve, too), but when I watched the anime, I often get confused in which storyline of which character to follow as all of them do have something to contribute, although for me, I have lost track of whose story to follow most of the time. Plus, when I say it\u2019s highly emotional, it can be too forced as in they should expect you to care about them instantly, either by playing sad music to compliment that. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I do care about what happens to some of the characters but whatever situation is easily being overdramatized as it goes and that often make me not give a damn anymore. However, as overly dramatic as it is, the story arcs are fine and while being nothing new about self-confidence, family, abandonment issues (let\u2019s face it, nothing is new nowadays) but the situation is mostly relatable for those (mostly anyone) who have been through those situations like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the basic anime archetypes but they are livelier than they sound. Tomoya Okazaki is the main character with a basic awful past (his mother died, father is a drunk and gambler and they don\u2019t get along, mostly Tomoya) but he is less stiff and can actually be a funny character once you get into the show and his friend Sunohara is more of a comic relief than him, but is actually the punching bag of the show, although he did deserve it many times and what can I say? It\u2019s funny to laugh at his pain. The main female characters are those that either have a crush or want to be in love with Tomoya and unlike any harem anime, it isn\u2019t overly annoying. Nagisa Furukawa is the main heroine of the anime, who\u2019s in her 3rd year of high school because of her illness of the \u201cUm?\u201d disease. (I called it the \u2018um?\u2019 disease because I honestly don\u2019t know what she got. That and somebody already used \u2018butt cancer\u2019 in their review.) That and her parents are outrageous, especially the father, who looks younger than he is. Kyou and Ryou Fujibayashi are sisters with Kyou being the aggressive one and Ryou being the timid one. Tomoyo Sakagami is the one that gets into a lot of fights in the school, mostly with delinquents and occasionally beats up Sunohara because of his stupidity and for kicks\u2026..and yet I love that about her. Kotomi Ichinose is another schoolmate, who is a very quiet girl but when she plays the violin, get some earplugs or far, far, far away from that and lastly there\u2019s Fuko Ibuki, the first year student who really likes to make starfishes and carves them out of wood and sell them a lot in the school and yes, I know of that twist of hers and no, I\u2019m not going to spoil it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation by Kyoto Animation does deserves some high marks as since their bread and butter are slice of life shows and their budget is high enough to make their animation lively, fluid, and beautiful to look at. Although, their character designs are the basic moe design, even on Sunohara, and I think they made some of the adults too identical to the teenagers as I couldn\u2019t tell who\u2019s older or younger, aside from a few characters. The music also gets a decent mark as I thought the score was remarkably well, even if it gets repetitive. The OP song is okay but nothing to remember unlike the ED song, which every reviewer I know likes this song, and I also do but I felt after most episodes, it felt inappropriate to play, especially if an episode ends on a bad or sour note. I know it\u2019s meant to be uplifting but it doesn\u2019t end you should play it on every single time.\\n\\n\r\nThe English dub by Sentai Filmworks has some great performances from Luci Christian (Nagisa), Hilary Haag (Fuko), David Matranga (Tomoya) and Shirley Calene-Black (Kyou) but aside from that, it was either a so-so dub that was rated to OK (The performances I listed above)-to-awkward (the adaptive script to other performances like Greg Ayres)-to-bad (most Japanese mispronunciations).\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: Clannad is a very emotional anime series that can tug to your heart but often feels too forced to care about the characters but it doesn\u2019t stop you from watching it. It\u2019s both funny and dramatic and I may not be the biggest fan of this, but you should probably give this show a chance before rejecting it.\\n",

If it werent for my brother convincing me it will get better, I would have quit watching it by the 3 episode. \r\nStory:       in my opinion Clannad was very predictable. After I watched the 2 episode, I already knew what the big thing everyone cries about was. Also, why wasnt nagisa there for half the show?!? Shes the main character! You cant just introduce her, take her away, and make her the main character again!Last, everything seemed over dramatic.     3/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: the art was a small upside to the show. The girls eyes were a little to big at first but I quickly got used to it. Now the things like the robot bothered me since they tried to make it look 3-d, but it made it annoying.          6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: the opening song was terrible to me and the songs they would play during the show was too. I really liked the dango song though! I'm obsessed with it!          3/4        \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: this got me the most. Out of all the characters, I hated them all but Fuko, tomoyo, and sunohara. Everyone else depended on tomoya way too much and couldnt do anything without him, specifically nagisa. Tomoya is known as a delinquent then sees this one girl he doesnt know, feels sorry for her and help her.  Thats what a delinquent does? I loved sunohara and fuko because they were funny and I liked tomoyo since she didnt depend on tomoya for everything.         1/1\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really hated it. It might've been better if they made they girls not seem like they cant do anything without tomoya(looks at nagisa).         1/1\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/2",

            "content": "i'm writing this review so i can point back at it when deciding what to recommend to people who have similar tastes to my own.  generally i do not read anime reviews before watching one, so i often don't know what i am getting myself into.  and i am on a quest to watch the 500 highest-rated anime of all time, which means i should not end up with total dreck.  or so you'd think.\r\nclannad wasn't total dreck, but i regret the time invested.  my overarching impression:  manipulative fakery.  i felt slightly dirty after watching it.  i don'tenjoy my heart strings so blatantly pulled with such dishonest intentions; i resent it.  \\n\\n\r\nwhat i liked:  okazaki tomoya is not quite as spine- and featureless as main male characters in harem anime often are.  he has a sarcastic streak, and he likes to play pranks on his friends.  his little, internal quips kept me from overdosing from moe. one of the female characters, sakagami tomoyo also happens to be competent all on her own, and is not in desperate need to be saved by okazaki.  the mysterious insert bits with the girl and the mechanical doll were intriguing, and beautiful.  honestly -- THAT was the anime i would have loved to see.  i also enjoyed the deceptively simple, childish ending song, and overall the sound wasn't bad.  nakamura yuuichi did a decent job as okazaki.\\n\\n\r\nwhat i didn't like:  the character designs of the girls.  in their efforts to maximize the moe, kyoani actually managed to create an uncanny valley effect for me here; the eyes are just too large and deformed, the face is too flat, and the tiny mouth sit so high on the face that the chin seem huge.  i found this anything but cute, and it was difficult to watch for a while, until i got desensitized to it.  the male characters (except for sunohara) are easier to look at, but they're generic anime guys, nothing special, nothing memorable.  speaking of sunohara, the comic relief guy, he wasn't funny.  he was mostly disgusting, and i wondered why the heck okazaki hung around with him.  the voice talent was also nothing to write home about; okiayu ryoutaro voiced furukawa akio, but i was less enthralled with him here than usual; akio felt overacted even in his few serious moments.  the different arcs were in themselves well developed, but when one finished and the next one started, the emotional events had no echoes beyond that arc; the previously featured girl went out of sight and out of mind.  that's not how real life works, that's not how good fiction works, and if you create an anime from a dating sim or similar medium, you need to adjust for that.  oh, and \"slice of life\"?  not even close.  in no life i know do complete newbs win ball games against trained amateurs.\\n\\n\r\nwhat frustrated me: okazaki's backstory looked promising, and felt realistic, but it was neglected to the point where it no longer mattered to me when it got dragged out for an episode to insert some drama.  fuuko's arc started interestingly, but then dragged on for much too long, and didn't really make enough sense.  and in the end fuuko is used just for comic relief, which is profoundly dishonest to the supposedly serious situation in which fuuko finds herself.  this could be a much stronger anime if it used its serious aspects more wisely, instead of sweeping them under the carpet as if oops, we didn't mean that.  \\n\\n\r\ni am not looking forward to watching the afterbirth, uh, after story for this, which is even more highly rated.  really, guys, is an excess of moe all you need?  i don't even hate moe per se, though i don't find it particularly attractive either; cute and helpless just isn't my thing.  but here it gets pushed at the expense of everything else, with supreme calculation.",

This high school is largely modeled after the University of Tsukuba-affiliated junior-high and high school Komaba in Setagaya, Tokyo, Japan. Throughout the story, glimpses into an Illusionary World are shown. This world is devoid of all life except for a young girl, though she later makes a body out of junk pieces through which the player can interact with her. The remaining half of the story takes place in the same city, after the conclusion of the first half.\r\nThere are recurring themes thatappear throughout the story. The main theme is the value of having a family, as the title of the series implies since according to Jun Maeda, Clannad means &quot;family&quot; or &quot;clan&quot; in Irish. Of the six main characters, Tomoya, Nagisa, and Kotomi have no siblings, though their parents factor in majorly in their stories. Fuko's and Kyou's stories have their sisters playing an integral part, and Tomoyo's story is influenced by her entire family. In Nagisa's story, there is a recurring appearance of the &quot;large family of dango&quot; (a fictional group mascot for children) that Nagisa is fond of. The minor theme of Irish words continues with the opening theme of the game, &quot;Mag Mell&quot;, which means roughly &quot;plain of joy&quot; and is connected with Irish mythology. The arrange album, a short music CD that contained remixed versions of songs in the game, that was released with the original game release was entitled Mabinogi which was a collection of prose stories from medieval Welsh manuscripts; Welsh is a branch of Celtic, as is Irish.\\n",

Clannad is an anime where you can laugh and you can expect a drama that can make you cry without you knowing it . Sure hope After Story has the same effect as this one\r\nStory:9\r\nThe story is about Okazaki Tomoya who is known as a delinquent . Tomoya and his close friend , Sunohara always skip school when they find its boring . But later on , Tomoya meets up with a girl named Furukawa Nagisa . This is where his life starting to change bits bybits . I just love how the story goes . I won't tell much about the story plot because i could turn this review into a complete spoiler .\\n\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\r\nThe arts and animation here are quite nice . There are some beautiful scenes that capture my interest . There are also a bit 3D animation here but not much .\\n\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nThe voice actor and actress was nice . Nothing that make me stop watching or anything . I just love the voice actress for Fuko . Soo kawaii voice she's got . The OP and ED was lovely . I enjoy the ED the most . \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:10\\n\r\nThe characters here does have background which some of them have a bit sad one . From Furukawa Nagisa , who has a lovely family , to Ibuki Fuko , who first know as a ghost because of the accident (I just love Fuko because she's always make me laugh like when she tried to make a Starfish Family song but fail without a doubt xD) , Okazaki Tomoya who has a problem with his father , who quits his job because of her wife death (It just so sad to see Tomoya's father like that) . There are others like Sunohara Youhei , who always got his ass kick by Tomoyo lol , the Fujibayashi sisters , Kyou and Ryou , Ichinose Kotomi , who also have a sad past , Sakagami Tomoyo , who has a mission to save the sakura tree and many more . All i can say is that they did a good job on the characters plot .\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nThe first few episodes , it was funny as hell . But later on , the drama starting to have an impact on me . I cry . I laugh . Thats all i can remember really . I enjoy the first till the last episode just fine .\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10\\n\r\nI can say that Clannad did not dissapoint me . I'm really glad that i watch this anime . If you want to watch an anime where they did a good job at comedy and at drama (especially drama because some anime tends to force you to cry for no reason) , then this one is for you . Just make sure that you didn't watch this anime at midnight like me . Because when you do , you gonna have trouble mainly because you were laughing so hard xD",

This anime kicked my favorite anime right of the top of the list. If you're considering to watch this anime, I reccomend you do because I thought it was really great!

How very interesting...snooze.\r\nWith these points in mind I started watching clannad and sadly my first impression did not change even an inch.\r\nThe art of the anime is superb and after the first episode I actually thought this might end up to be one of my favourites. Quite clearly, it did not. This was due to the story, which tried to be very gripping and dramatic to the point that it drowned in it's own attempt.At the same time it was trying tobe overly cute and adorable and I'm not a big fan of moe or kawaii. In addition, the main girl Nagisa was annoying as hell. Some people might say cute, I say pathetic. \\n\\n\r\nI really, really wanted to like this anime but it just didn't work out. I admit, I kinda skimmed through the last 8 or so episodes so the grade could probably be better, or not. The only reason I finished this was because I wanna watch the After Story and keeping my fingers crossed that it will be better.",

            "content": "(Note: I have not yet seen Clannad: After Story and my review is based solely on Clannad)\r\nIt's a shame I found this show so disappointing as I felt it had real potential and could have really been a very good series.\r\nClannad ended up being a decent slice of life series that was ultimately held back by the way it handled its characters and how these characters molded into the story.\r\nSTORY(6/10):\r\nInstead of seeing this show as a cohesive, impactful story, it came across as three major backstories of the characters loosely linked by the characters themselves and the ending. Although much of the story did feelvery forced, the show did successfully get me to feel for the characters several times throughout its story, these moments were somewhat ruined by how fake they felt, almost as if the thoughts put into these scenes was like, \"Oh! It's been a while since something terrible happened and as this is supposed to be a depressing show let's just invent some unfortunate circumstances to add to the story\" I felt like a similar line of thinking was applied to the comedy as this show, yet some of the jokes did occasionally connect with me.\\n\\n\r\nART(7/10):\\n\\n\r\nI don't have much to say about the art of Clannad, it never felt physically jarring to the eyes but still never really stood out. I have to say that some of the character facial expressions were very well done and felt real in parts: a departure from the typical cutesy look of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND(7/10):\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly to how I felt about the art of Clannad, the show's OST never really stood out to me aside from the OP which I felt was alright. Nagisa's and several of the other lead girls' voices felt a bit high-pitched though.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER(MINOR SPOILERS- 3/10):\\n\\n\r\nI feel like I need to explain my very low score for this aspect of Clannad. It boils down to much of the cast feeling fake and to willing to change their ideals and desires for someone else or the plot of the show. I hated how the show's outcome felt fixed from the beginning even though a major theme of the series being overcoming lingering emotions about the past plaguing their present. (Basically, Clannad felt like it wanted to develop its characters through reaching a peaceful state of mind despite suffering from tragic circumstances yet development can only go so far when the lack of thought put into the details of these problems is strikingly obvious.)\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue I had with the show is how it attempted to illustrate the depth of the characters' feelings yet utterly compromised on most of them for the sake of the plot. The most apparent example of this is how the show handled the romantic feelings of the girls in the series. All of the main girls in the series fell in love with the main character yet immediately ignored their feelings once the MC publicly showed his care for another girl despite being very set on getting him to go out with them beforehand. This felt extremely wrong with Kyou, especially because of how her character was designed.\\n\\n\r\nTwo characters I felt suffered the most as a result of Clannad's nature to appeal to both comedy and sadness were Sunohara and Fuuko for completely different reasons.\\n\\n\r\nSunohara was the \"running joke\" of Clannad and was relied too heavily on for gags and thus I felt should have been treated more seriously. Like really, everyone falling  in love with Tomoya whereas Sunohara is left to eat the dust seems unrealistic. The show attempting to justify this by construing many scenes where Sunohara is depicted as a pervert and animal is just cruel.\\n\\n\r\n(SPOILERish) On the other hand, Fuuko seemed a completely fine girl if not just a little basic. The show initially treating her as a genuine character that was able to attain contentment was nice for a change. This was ultimately ruined though by her showing up again much later in the series in tense moments for comedic(?) relief which makes no sense to me.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, the other characters are respectable for the most part otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT(5/10):\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to enjoy Clannad. Although I may have been touched by it in parts and intrigued by the mystery it promotes throughout the story, Clannad feels too stuctured and treats its characters with too much inconsistency even for being inconsistent teenagers to feel real.\\n",

            "content": "Several problems with this anime, the biggest of which is the arc-per-girl system.\r\nThat said, there were several powerful moments. Fuko's storyline had me tearing up, and as weak as the Tomoya/Nagisa was, the final episode with the Tomoya/Tomoyo spinoff was amazing. \r\nThe protagonist is able, has a good sense of humor, is quite relateable and easy to root for. I enjoyed watching this.\r\nHaving said all that, here is a more detailed review:\r\nCLANNAD Review\r\nPros:\r\n-First of all, the animation is great. Right up there in terms of quality. Some might take good animation for granted, but it's really not a sure thing in drama anime, so forthat I'm grateful.\\n\\n\r\n-Some very good characters*. People like Akio, Sanae, Sunohara, Yoshino and Tomoyo were very well developed, and were some of the best examples of their roles in anime that I have seen to date. They are my favorite characters (after my No1 character) and imo they carried the show.\\n\\n\r\n-*Tomoya himself. I very rarely like a main character as much as I did Tomoya. He feels like someone I can relate to easily because he feels like a real person, like an actual character. Yes, he has some qualities that one usually only sees in anime, but for the most part he feels very real, and has significant, important development as time goes on while retaining his realism. He plays pranks to his friends, he doesn't care about his future initially, his heart is in the right place, and he grows as he experiences things.\\n\r\nBecause of how well made the main character was, I could forgive the show's (many) sins and keep watching, because Clannad(and even more so Afterstory) are primarily Tomoya's journey.\\n\\n\r\n-Very good humor. When the show wanted to be funny, it succeeded. Sunohara, Tomoya and Nagisa's parents are a big factor in this.\\n\\n\r\n-Good balance between humor and drama. It didn't lack in either, and could time them correctly.\\n\\n\r\n-The tension between Tomoya and his dad. It is nothing quite as obvious as violence, or any outright signs of abuse, yet it is made clear that Tomoya and his dad don't get along, and that Tomoya thinks very strongly of him. The relationship between them isn't fully explored in the first season and that's great, because it leaves the reader to piece together their own explanation with what little, subtle hints we were given.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n-The arc pattern is probably the worst thing about CLANNAD. The 'girl per arc' pattern that held true for most of the season was pretty crippling to the story as a whole. Yes, many of these characters were interesting (looking at you, Kotomi) but with the way the arcs were made these characters were given their five minutes in the spotlight and then never bothered with again.\\n\r\nMost of the supporting cast never says anything worthwhile after their time in the spotlight is over. And all the development and/or backstory that was given to these characters feels wasted, because they're never relevant ever again. There is no balance between character screentime.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact...\\n\\n\r\n-Character screentime. All of the supporting cast with the exception of Akio, Sanae and Sunohara(who will nevertheless get his in Afterstory) either only have a pair of episodes of development before returning to the sidelines or never leave the sidelines at all.\\n\r\nTake for example Kyou and Ryou. I'll go on a limb here and assume that the shy one was Ryou. We never learn anything about her besides 'she's class leader' and 'she likes Tomoya'. She never does or says anything, and she never displays any show of personality whatsoever to her name. Kyou, at least, has some personality to her name, but again we never get to know her or anything about her, so even that feels shallow.\\n\r\nAnother example of terrible character screentime balance is Nagisa. During a pair of consecutive arcs about some girl or other Nagisa is all but gone from the show, when before and (especially) after she returns to being the secondary protagonist. That sudden switch in focus is jarring as f-.\\n\\n\r\n-Nagisa herself. I didn't hate Nagisa. Yes, she is all the cliches of that type of person put together, but I didn't hate her. I just wish she wasn't the protagonist along with Tomoya.\\n\r\nAfterstory kind of makes up for it, but in CLANNAD Nagisa has all the personality of a wooden board, and what personality she does display is not something I particularly admire or enjoy watching.\\n\\n\r\nLiterally the only girl that I would've preferred Nagisa over is Ryou. And even that is arguable. That extra episode of Tomoya having a relationship with Tomoyo was absofuckinglutely amazing. Easily the highlight of the entire show, and that is because Tomoyo is an interesting, well-developed character that differs from Tomoya without being any less of a person than he is. Tomoya/Tomoyo OTP!! Kyou would have been a better love interest than Nagisa was. Hell, even Kotomi would have been a better love interest than Nagisa was.\\n\r\nI didn't hate Nagisa. I just really, really hoped that her solo scenes(the ones without Tomoya) would end quickly.\\n\\n\r\n-The other world scenes. I think putting this in the Cons is a little excessive. Still, there was no obvious connection between the main storyline, what little hints we were given were NOT very promising, and they took episode time and developer time/money that could have been put in things like 'characterization' and 'pacing'.\\n\\n\r\n-The supernatural elements. I teared up like a little girl when Fuko was being forgotten. I admit it. I did and would probably tear up again if I rewatched it.\\n\r\nThat said, what the f-? Fuko's arc made no fucking sense, in hindsight. Adding supernatural elements on a modern setting is not impossible or even rare, but here they didn't even make an attempt to have it make sense. Not just Fuko, either. Whenever anything supernatural was hinted at I cringed, because they were so obvious and terrible that they completely detracted from the whole experience. Afterstory is much more guilty of this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: Despite it's many and numerous faults, CLANNAD has too strong a foundation to call a 'bad' show. Tomoya is a great, relatable and realistic protagonist who develops as time passes, and a lot of the supporting cast are very strong, too. The animation and good soundtrack add to the whole experience and the balance between humor and drama is pretty spot-on, though I did roll my eyes at several obvious tear-jerkers.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end, I did not regret watching CLANNAD. Yes, it had many faults, yes it could have been much, much better, but it was good.\\n\\n\r\nI would say a 7/10 would suffice.",

            "content": "To begin with Clannad is a very peculiar anime from the usual stuff i watch. The closest being Spice & Wolf as the two belong to the \u2018slice of life\u2019 genre. This is exactly what Clannad is as we follow the life of a High School Senior in Japan who just doesn\u2019t know what he is doing with his life. On the most superficial level Clannad seems little more than a frilly series about finding love and all the stereotypes that are associated with that. To anyone who has watched the series though they will rapidly come to know that this is so far fromthe truth. What Clannad does so well is bring these characters, their lives, their struggles and their pains to life to the point where I felt like i was going through it with them. One by one we get a peak into the interworkings of peoples lives from the strange to the heartbreaking as everyone tries to be in it together. After all this and the typical High School anime setting the show takes a surprising turn with Clannad: After Story, which is very much dealing with what happens after \u2018Happily Ever After\u2019. This is where the struggle of finding yourself in the world and becoming one with society comes to the fore along with the struggle of holding on to what you love and the inevitable compromises that come with growing up. Clannad is a love story, and so is Clannad: After Story, but After Story is very much life as we all know it, with the good times, the bad times and everything that comes in between as we try to go through each and every day. This isn\u2019t a show about heroes or leaders of men, but people. With Clannad i laughed, i teared up and outright sobbed with these characters to the point where i was screaming at my computer that \"It isn\u2019t fair\u201d. Then again life is rarely fair and makes those happy moments all the more precious. Clannad in so many ways just made me feel human like little else ever has. 10/10.",

            "content": "Clannad... oh Clannad\r\nClannad was an awesome journey. It was heartbreaking, moving, I grew more and more attached to it as time went on. By the way, I'm listening to Clannad soundtracks as I type this, so don't mind the sobbi *sobs*\r\nStory\r\nClannad's story was sad and fun at the same time. It took us through the stories of the different characters, and as it went on, it grows sadder until the final resolution. It was really heartbreaking, and the resolution always felt so warm. Many might find the stories cliched, and it might be, but I feel this makes it sadder because they remind you oftrue life events. And though it might be cliched, Clannad brings us to look at it from another perspective. The only problem I have, is that some of the arcs were not developed to its full potential, say Tomoyo's. Then again, this was based on a visual novel, so its really hard to squeeze them all into 24 eps. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nOh the art... While many might not like the \"moe\" style of Clannad characters, I personally found them fitting for this anime. Clannad is an anime about family and these themes, so the softness of the animation really matches. The beauty of the art also helps remind me of the beauty in life. This might sound cliche, but seriously. I love the art. and sakuras are pretty. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks are REALLY beautiful and peaceful, yet at times fun, take Incessant or Dumb. The soundtracks help to amplify the sadness, nostalgia and fun-ness in the scenes. When Nagisa's theme played during the first episode, I almost cried, thats just how potent it is. (btw, i knew nothing abt clannad before i watched it) The repeated use of character themes also increase the nostalgia when you listen to them. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all have many sides to them. Take Fuko, shes cute, and has an obsession with starfish and all, but she also has a goal she works hard for. The characters are all really likeable, and as their arcs progress you learn more about them, which makes them more relatable and likeable too. Even the juke character Sunohara has problems and a serious side to him. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, to me, Clannad was not just any other anime. It opened my eyes up and made me appreciate the beauty in life. \\n\\n\r\nClannad is a beautiful, heart warming, funny, awesome anime and you should definitely watch it. It might not be as depressing as After Story, but the characte build-up is an important part of the series and the first season definitely should not be overlooked.",

A guy with a complete lack of a backbone and no ability to make any decisions meets a girl that shows an interest in him and they waltz around each other for the majority of the episodes until at the end of it they finally decide to declare their love for each other.\r\nA generichighschool romance story that is about as overused as can be.\\n\r\nIt does have some original points, especially at the beginning but soon drops into the standard clich\u00e9 that has been used since the start of the genre. Although even if the story is as generic and standard as can be expected, the comedy is refreshing and it does have it's original points, but the fact remains that it's a huge clich\u00e9.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe artwork is nice and well used. It's pleasant to the eye, gives a good mood and is fitting with the type of story that it sets. Nothing really noteworthy or outstanding, but it's fitting and decent.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe sound is well used and creates a good mood. I especially liked the use of sound effects and music in the episodes around the theatre episodes.\\n\r\nBut again, not outstanding but decent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nThe characters are one of the things that were grating against my nerves. The spinelessness of the main characters and their indecisiveness, although standard in this genre, is completely overused and done to death.\\n\r\nThere is however a decent amount of character development and well presented background stories.\\n\r\nHowever the massive amounts of overuse of old clich\u00e9s works against the whole of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nIt's a decent anime and I generally enjoyed it, eventhough the characters and the story was more or less generic. It could have been worse but it lacked in originality.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nA decent anime, but easily forgotten and lost in the background of the hundreds of other titles in the heavily overused genre of Highschool (Comedy) Romance.\\n\\n\r\nLacking in originality and overused basic character traits, not outstanding but entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nIf you didn't think my review was helpful, please leave a message on my profile and explain why you thought my review wasn't helpful.

            "content": "All the pictures you find of this anime makes it look like a standard Harem / slice of life style anime, its so much more than that, intact its not Harem at all really. First of all lets talk story, fantastic, although it does have its flaws. Split up into several clear arcs which are all in themselves entertaining and engaging, each arc focuses on a subsidiary character outside the main two leads, its a format that works really well. As well as this we have larger story arcs going across the whole series, this is the only weakness, a little more of this anda little less individual focus would have been right, but the balance is almost perfect. It is serious, it is dramatic, it is cute, it is also funny, it balances slapstick, emotion, drama and flashbacks really really well, i went through this series so quickly because of it. \\n\\n\r\nYou cannot really fault the artwork in this serious. From a technical point of view it looks just incredible, so much detail but also such great use of colour. That brings me to the second point, they really use the colour schemes of scenes to reflect and set mood in such a brilliant way. It works so well, somehow managing to use a pretty mundane background setting and make it look dark, beautiful, full of light or sadness; fantastic. Just like this the soundtrack is brilliant and at times especially towards the end of the story arcs evokes a lot of emotion, brilliant. \\n\\n\r\nThis story is driven by character however, and it excels at that. We see long arcs of development throughout the series, in fact the idea of growing as a person is probably what the entire show is about. They do not make it unrealistic, its done i a way that i plausible, gaining confidence, finding friends, its relatable to a lot of people. We have a wide range of characters, and no pointless fan service. Even those outside the core cast are well though out and develop across the course of the show. I enjoyed it a lot, and i guess i am only half way through the entire story. \\n\\n\r\nI am not somebody who gets emotional very easily but this show had me very much invested into the characters on screen. I loved it and would recommend it to anybody. Character driven drama at its best. Its not a romance, its not a coming of age story, its not a slice of life. It somehow rides the balance between the 3 in a way that balances out perfectly. Throw in beautiful art, music, character and structure and you have a beautiful anime. A definite watch.",

And has encounters and experiences with all of them. \r\nThe art was fantastic, I think its the best art Ive seen, nothing has ever beat it.\r\nThe sound was great, I cant say to much about it.\r\nThe character was the best, each one had there little own personality. You could recognize who it was by there voice and there art design. They were all really developed. They all also had their really weird likings and interests.\r\nI really enjoyed this anime a lot, i would suggestit to the people who know what anime is not those Shonen-Action-tards.",

The main story, in my eyes, was about the Drama Club.\r\nStory: I loved the story, and how it progressed. A very touching story, to me. Some of the scenes were so touching it almost made me cry. The atmosphere that the story makes is incredible. It made me feel like I was actually there, watching all of these events play out.\r\nArt: I loved the art. The animation was AMAZING. I loved all the facial expressions, all of the kicks, the fights, andjust the scenery. It's all perfect. I loved how the animators took their time and made everything look so real.\\n\r\nSound: It was good, I loved the songs and everything, just a few of the songs were a little repetitive, which almost got annoying. But the songs were atleast playing at the correct moment, to help move everything on, and have the atmosphere transform.\\n\r\nCharacters: I LOVED all the characters [except Fuuko]. They were all awesome. With their own attitude. They all had awesome facial expressions, and most of them were moe. &gt;,&lt; \\n\r\nEnjoyment: I don't have any words for how much I really loved this series. It was just.. phenomenal!  The stories, the art, the characters... Everything is wonderful.\\n\r\nOverall, I give the show a 10/10.\\n",

The story itself teaches us that all of us have problems and that through friendships and love for each other we can all accomplish our dreams. It starts off with Tomoya Okazaki a senior student that is definitely bored with life. No aspiration at all till he meets a girl name Nagisa Furukawa. She wants to start a drama club, a dream that she has, and he helps her seeing that he doesn'thave anything to do. And things goes off from there. Also each episode is quite sweet and there are many humorous moments. Overall it is a great show, with many heart warming moments and you should try to watch it. The artwork is really great and all of the characters are well designed and their personality are quite great.",

            "content": "Plot (6.5/10):\r\n\u201cshall I take you? to a place in the city where wishes come true\u201d \r\n-Episode 1, Clannad, Nagisa \r\nThe message of what Clannad initially intends is promising \u2013 however, it is something that is not correctly delivered in my opinion. The series is divided into a series of arcs that at the very end of the day, it has an overarching theme that it tries to deliver. It works \u2013 sort of. My biggest problem was in the division of the arcs \u2013 it was extremely unevenly divided especially with the beginning 10 episodes being entirely focused on Fuko and then approximately 3 episodesdedicated to the main heroine in the story, Nagisa. Honestly. What the heck? While the arcs themselves are beautiful and emotionally provoking, the transition between each arc is messy and rough. Overall, it did work, but it left some holes (such as the robot and the girl) that ALWAYS came out in the beginning of the episodes but never was there an explanation to satisfy the viewers at the end of the series. Also, the stories are quite cliche.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (8/10):  simply amazing. Animation is extremely clean \u2013 it\u2019s easy on the eyes and there isn\u2019t anything that distracts me from the story. I\u2019m not really an artist so I can\u2019t really critique as well as I would like, but nothing really bothered me too much about the art, aside from the fact that all the girls seem to look EXACTLY THE SAME. IN the beginning I couldn\u2019t remember their names and just started calling them \u201cthe silver haired girl\u201d \u201cthe brown haired\u201d \u201cthe purple twins\u201d etc.  \\n\\n\r\nMusic (10/10): the music is fantastic, but they are rather simple melodies. However, it worked for Clannad. Clannad for the most part, tells a simple, slice-of-life story. So the music fit beautifully and wove into the story (especially in the emotional moments, but also in the comedic moments as well) I think the voices were appropriate for each characters \u2013 especially tomoya\u2019s.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.5/10): My biggest problem with the characters were their development into the story. I felt that certain characters were overemphasized than others, but the development of side characters in some sense had outshadowed the two main characters\u2019 growth which had bothered me. But I did love Nagisa\u2019s parents as well as Tomoya\u2019s bff as comic relief throughout the story. Each character has a quirk that makes them easy to distinguish one from another in terms of personality, which I loved and wished was further developed.  \\n\\n\r\nenjoyment (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10) for me this was an anime with potential that was never fully developed. I always felt that Clannad with 24 episodes was just too short to tell its full story about all the characters, to tell an overarching message AND to develop a loveline between tomoya and nagisa. Although it is important to keep in mind that Clannad was originally a visual novel containing multiple branching storylines -- and so there were hardships to integrate the storyline into one and still keep a focus, it is still not an excuse for convoluted and confusing arcs that were not well put together. Overall, with it\u2019s poignant stories, it\u2019s an anime that could be watched for enjoyment, but with plot holes here and there and rough transitions, it ends up being  nothing more than an \u201caverage\u201d anime in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\n***************\\n\\n\r\nwith that being said, I HIGHLY encourage anyone who had either 1) the same opinions as I did after finishing clannad/clannad AS 2) who loved the series to death to play the visual novel. While I think Clannad/Clannad AS averages out to be a 8/10 total, the Visual Novel is a solid 10/10. It covers all the \"holes\" and problems I had with the anime seamlessly and spins a simply beautiful story. (the story is the same, but it's more indepth and the characters are much more fleshed out). I've played around 20 Visual Novels (Ever-17, Tsukihime, Sharin no kuni etc) so far -- and I can say with confidence that Clannad is definitely a gem. If you are going to play the game though, I highly recommend the 300 hour walkthrough (more like a must-have) it's extremely hard to play without one in my opinion. \\n\\n",

            "content": "The starting point of an incredibly difficult journey, this is not for the weak of heart and emotionless stoics. This will rip your soul apart, tape it back together again, then rip it up again, and repeat this vicious cycle until there's no more tape left. Before you watch, have a box of tissues ready and a bottle of water, because by the end, your eyes will have produced enough water to turn you into a dehydrated zombie. \r\nClannad can't be summed up in its entirety. You can't break it down to just event after event, because everything ties together to form a magnificent story;a story that the author was obviously content with, and could work with until the very end. Messages that are so subtle and refined that the viewers often look past it while following the happenings of the riveting story. The beginning is just as important to the end, as the ending is to the beginning, if that makes sense. Every episode leaves an unfair cliff-hanger, beckoning the viewers and drawing them deeper and deeper into this unforgivable sea of sadness and twists.\\n\\n\r\nThe transitions and relations of one episode to another, whether it be the previous or next, is simply magnificent. While the viewer may not completely understand everything right away, the beauty lies at the very end, when the final piece of the frustratingly heart-wrenching puzzle is placed, and we can see the whole picture without doubt and misinterpretation. Meanwhile, the story does an excellent job in maintaining control over the pace of the plot, making sure that nothing is rushed or skipped(because every little detail is crucial to the overall plot). \\n\\n\r\nSome may find the plot to be slow. Some may find the characters uninteresting. Some may find the whatever to be whatever. Regardless, Clannad serves everyone equally, but those with specific taste palates may find it more enjoyable than others. I believe, however, that Clannad represents fundamental and unavoidable themes that pertain to all of our lives, no matter how different we may be. Themes of difficulty in love, friendships, and learning to be with each other. Of facing reality, losing yourself in regret, and being responsible. Of knowing that, although there are incredibly tall and difficult obstacles at times, life must move on, as must you. \\n\\n\r\nI can't explain Clannad to you, as I myself have difficulty explaining it to myself. Simply give it a chance, and you'll automatically step into my shoes, and the shoes of so many others who have been touched by this rare gem of an anime. \\n\\n\r\n10/10.",

            "content": "One of the most difficult aspects of reviewing the pinnacle of the legendary KyoAni & Key Trinity of shows, for me personally; are the combination of two issues: \r\n1. My faithful belief that anything KyoAni touches just...oozes with quality and care, that absolutely NOTHING that comes out of their studio ISN'T great and worth watching (Translation: I'm a KyoAni fan, with good reason, too, as I will explain later).\r\n2. The emotionally manipulative nature of the source material and the resulting adaptation that only intensified such aspects of appealing to emotions of viewers. In simpler terms: This franchise very much tried to (and obviously succeeded) snipetheir audience with a narrow but fatally effective tactic of appealing to raw emotion ONLY.\\n\\n\r\nNow, when I rate shows for my own records or try to find new shows to watch, I usually take my personal connection and enjoyment as almost always my sole scale of comparison: did I ENJOY this director/writer/author's other works? If so than HELL YEAH, give me more. But, when I sit down to pen a \"professional\" review for the benefit of other people (translation: forcing my views upon others 'gently'), I try to bring forth the other aspects into play for a more objective view. And frankly, Clannad 1st season is; for the most part; pretty average or even mediocre in some ways. The plot takes way too many liberties for one that's set in a realistic world that looks and acts just like ours, some of the main characters lack the development to shed their cookie-cutter boringness, the melodrama and plot advancing felt all-too-forced and artificially constructed if one had the (un)fortunate ability to shut down their eye-taps and their hearts\u2019 nerves and look at the show with emotionless, robot-like objectivity (I surprised myself with such abilities after FINALLY sitting down to rewatch the series for this review\u2026I feel ashamed.)\\n\\n\r\nThe sole reason for this first season\u2019s lasting popularity and being crowned as a gateway title into the romance genre of anime are its creators\u2019 acute understanding of simple human psychology; understandably useful and welcome talents for any creators of entertainment; but it also makes the show feel lazy if that\u2019s the only tool it knows how to utilise. \\n\\n\r\nThe relatively large cast which includes the male lead, a self-hating, sarcastic but inhumanely sympathetic and helpful Tomoya, sidekick punching bag Youhei, Fuko, a girl with a starfish fetish, a slew of love interests in a classic harem-like fashion in the form of quietly determined but shy Nagisa, bipolar twins of gangster Kyou and submissive Ryou, bookworm Kotomi and badass ice queen Tomoyo plus (some admittedly well-realised and effective) your usual group of side characters all make a very much entertaining ride. Thankfully, easily the most respectable aspect of this show being a harem; is that this show never tries to be cheap and allow the usually annoying parts of a stereotypical harem comedy show sipping in for the sake of cheap laughs and fan service. \\n\\n\r\nRealistically, this show can almost not be called a harem, since the lead Tomoya never had any issues of choosing his \u2018one\u2019, with the other unlucky girls, who were almost immediately placed in the story as friends, without giving the audience a moment to doubt who Tomoya would end up together with by the end.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with the story NOT being \u2018who will he choose?\u2019, the multiple arcs are each a series of slowly-building canon music pieces-like stories that sees Tomoya attempting to aid one girl out of the group in her quest to achieve a task or to resolve a childhood tragedy, which after its eventual resolving; plus the inevitable cry-fest; the arc ends and we are back at it again with another girl. And this is the aspect of the show which I found incredibly difficult to critique: it\u2019s the best AND possibly the worst part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhen seen for the first time, each individual arcs did very well in their ability to steadily build up melodrama, effective character development for the girl in the limelight and for the male lead. It is for this reason, that Tomoya was effectively the most well-developed and well-rounded character in the series; a trait which was further solidified with the second season, After Story.\\n\\n\r\nEach arc works well for different reasons, due to their large variety in subject matter. For example, the more fantastical nature of Fuko\u2019s quest to fulfil her life-long dream of seeing her older sister happy with a husband; a simple folk-tale-like ghost story that ends with fitting bitter sweetness was nicely contrasted with Kotomi\u2019s attempt to grow past a tragic childhood with her parents; and an ending which I felt was a nice example of perfect storytelling through non-literal imagery and well-placed plot devices that serve as representations of larger-than-life concepts: that the bonds between family transcends time and space. Watch the show and see how the show successfully portrayed this message with the use of a made-up Physics thesis and a teddy bear.\\n\\n\r\nBut these two arcs are also effective examples of what I find hard to truly believe as a marvel in storytelling in anime and a reason why I feel that Clannad is not a show for the intellectual, but for those who follow their guts and hearts only. In complete contrast to my above praises for Kotomi\u2019s arc and its successful storytelling using tools beyond monologues, my main gripe against Clannad IS its reliance on direct manipulation of the viewers emotions; the placing of scenes, the wording of dialogue and the use of the astoundingly simple musical score are all intentionally and artificially sewn together with the sole intention of maximum effectiveness when the bombshell is finally revealed at the end of each arc; natural progression of plot is secondary to the writers and animators of the series, who are all instead focused on placing the audience in the right moment for their carefully staged reveal. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding Fuko\u2019s arc, without spoiling major plot points, the last 2 or 3 episodes of the arc is a classic example of emotional staging for the audience: the issue is revealed in a fashion that shocks the audience, enough to startle, but not enough for an emotional outburst. Then the show takes its sweet time in sprinkling salt on the wound, with scenes that are emotionally difficult to watch, all emphasising the nature of Fuko\u2019s situation. A few tears are no doubt shed and feelings of sympathy are no doubt imbedded in the audience by this time. The show then proceeds to feint a few moments of light-hearted fun and moe-infused cuteness with Fuko celebrating her birthday with her friends. Then in the morning, the show pulls out all stops and decides to show the one thing that the audience were tricked into believing; would not happen. Of course, for 10 minutes, the audience are forced to watch as 2 of Fuko\u2019s friends trying to deal with the unforgivable circumstances, before the bombshell is delivered, perfectly timed when the audience were properly traumatised; half-revived and traumatised again. All these scenes are not naturally progressive in a plot standpoint; they are delivered in a fashion that seems to be all-too-convenient for the show\u2019s own intentions. Of course, you can argue that not all things in life are so predictable and can be logically explained; but then there\u2019s the issue of explaining why these scenes are shown in such ways that were obviously storyboarded with the pure intention of a massive emotional pay-off. \\n\\n\r\nIt is therefore undeniable, that rating a show ONLY on its ability to make audiences cry is not the best way to fairly judge a show; the human emotion is all too easily influenced by those who know the art; think of why Yu-Gi-Oh\u2019s most cheesy friendship monologues made you cry, despite of your brain\u2019s scoffing and moaning, and why WWII propaganda worked so well to convince the masses to commit near-genocides.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the various subjects that Clannad absolutely excelled at. In a standalone perspective, the girl and the robot scenes is another example of the constraints of adapting from another medium: scenes that may not take away from the experience in the visual novel made absolutely no sense in the 1st season, and it never gets resolved until the end of the 2nd season. However, ironically, these useless scenes are tiny moments where Kyoto Animation decides to blow up their coffers to provide us the best animation ever achieved for a 24 episode TV series during the time this show was airing\u2026and it still holds up and beats 95% of shows in quality that are airing in 2015. A typical characteristic of a KyoAni show is their ability to somehow always produce shows that either just simply becomes the best looking show of whichever seasonit was airing, or with a production value and style so high or so popular that it begins to influence the anime industry itself; all with a reportedly modest budget, instead relying on a welcomingly well-knited small group of animators, writers and directors who are unconstrained by time and the pressure of working in subpar conditions and having to work on multiple shows in one season. \\n\\n\r\nClannad has the perfect combination of purposefully detailed background art that knows how to sell the personality of the setting and the town, varied animation that can portray action effectively, smooth in-between animation to keep movements steady and of course the prolific KyoAni touch of subtle character body movements to sell realism and a cinematic quality of the show. For 2007-08, this show handily beats all of its counterparts in the reign of production value and the visual department, all the while competing with the heavy-hitters of 2007-8, a period considered by many as the most recent Golden Age of Anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn the department of sound, the Dub vs. Sub debate remains; having watched both to completion, I would say that the Sub has the best voices for the male and female leads (Tomoya\u2019s later-revealed girlfriend) I\u2019ve heard in a while; with the male lead\u2019s voice having a flavour that sells a damaged teenage delinquent, who is otherworldly passionate in helping others, without losing his sarcastic flare, while the female lead\u2019s sincere and moe-infused voice fits the role perfectly. The dub, whilst inferior, does its job well for the most part for a more realistic take on the voices of actual teenagers.\\n\\n\r\nThe musical score is another issue of splitting hairs for me. Jun Maeda himself wrote the music to his creation; with his usual flare of dreaming up simple melodies that manages to carry massive baggage in the form of emotional onslaught. So what\u2019s perfect about it? It knows when to use its character themes, when to let it all loose to add to the inevitable climax at an arc\u2019s end, and it is one of the major aspects of the entire show that remains memorable for anyone who has seen the show.\\n\\n\r\nI shall admit my distaste towards synth and anything not created by an acoustic instrument or vocal performance. Anything by a massive orchestra or a simple ensemble of piano, solo violin and a few woodwinds is instantly better in my books. So I should hate this soundtrack with a passion: cheap synth trying to replicate a solo clarinet or a strings section makes it impossible to listen separately most of the time.  So why don\u2019t I? The most celebrated theme in the whole show: Nagisa\u2019s theme/Dango song, is what I believe to be one of the best single themes in anime history: it is utterly impossible to forget it once you finished the show, and it\u2019s childishly simple melody carries with itself, a sense of child-like wonderment and nostalgia. I won\u2019t be able to tell you the significance of the Nagisa/Dango theme without a) leaving it for the After Story review and b) crowning it as the one single aspect of the entire show that absolutely embodies the one SINGLE overarching theme of this 50 episode show: the title \u2018Clannad\u2019 and its obvious homage to the word \u2018Clan\u2019 and in turn, the theme of \u2018Family\u2019: the childish bliss that is the Dango song; sang as the ED for every episode of Clannad 1st season; is a constant reminder of the importance of family, a song made all the more effective the more episodes you watched. In short, this is barely scratching the surface in explaining the importance of this one deceptively simple musical theme. Read on to my eventual After Story review for a more complete answer.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in the end, IS Clannad a good show? So what should a good anime do? Take us on a journey that\u2019s unforgettable, make us love the characters and lose ourselves in their world, teach us something profound and new and, most importantly, be enjoyable. Clannad achieves that in SPADES. Despite its issues with some character developments and my objective issues with HOW it goes about doing so, what it DOES achieve is practically unprecedented. It was no accident that Clannad/After Story is one of the most celebrated shows in the romantic genre; it is sincere and heartfelt, emotionally charged in amounts few has attempted successfully before and embarks on a noble quest on teaching the value of family. As a standalone season, Clannad is a flawed season with a few aspects of perfection that makes it only more important to finish the journey with Clannad After Story: In other words, it\u2019s a must watch under the reality that; while not being an masterpiece, it\u2019s a stepping stone FOR something greater.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who made it this far, thanks for reading one of my first reviews where I went this deep on an anime show; being an new anime fan and everything. Looking forward to writing more in the future.\\n",

            "content": "Clannad is a romance at its core, but is peppered with weird psychological plots and character backgrounds that are enough to make you cry. It\u2019s based on a visual novel series and what could have been a cash-in to the apparently popular Japanese V.N turns out to be a heart felt romance/comedy/drama that starts slow but introduces us to some amazingly likeable characters. This is where the show wins many brownie points.\r\nStory\r\nThe story of Clannad is not what I thought it would be. What I thought would be a Toradora like romance/comedy turned out to be a very heartfelt and character driven series. It startswith Tomoya, a delinquent, meeting a nice, quiet girl, Nagisa. Tomoya has daddy issues and these get in the way of his basketball skills. This is what constitutes the first few episodes. So I figured that this would be the basis of the romance, lots of background issues needing to be resolved. The main issue is reestablishing the theater club because Nagisa has always wanted to be an actress.Okay, I thought. Decent plot for romance. But then the series takes LSD and decides to add in a girl in a coma who is somehow appearing to people at the school to invite them to her sister\u2019s wedding. Later on we meet a shy, nerdy girl whose parents died in a plane crash and used to know Tomoya because he saved her from a fire.Then the romance kicks back in as we see a kind of three way romance. Tomoyo, Nagisa, and the class president all like Tomoya, but he of course chooses Nagisa over everyone. And I declined to add spoiler to that because it\u2019s obvious from the first five minutes who the romance will be between. Seriously.\\n\\n\r\nSo the story is weird and has some Elfen Lied-like turns that are truly heart wrenching.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nThe animation for the show is good, but not great. At some points it has great colors but I noticed a dull pallor to the whole show that never really went away. The bright colors were even kind of dull. This may be a result of the older animation, but it isn\u2019t totally bad. The characters, though, have strange eyes. I mean, I\u2019ve seen crazy anime eyes but these people have bigger eyes than I am used to and they just don\u2019t look right. They looked downright horrifying at first and took some getting used to. Otherwise, the animation looks good. Nothing revolutionary though.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe Japanese version contains some great voice actors. Emotion is displayed well through voice work and adds to the mood. The opening song is good, and the closing song is cute. Dango, dango, dango, dango, dango.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nIt\u2019s time for everyone\u2019s favorite game: Who is Ratchet\u2019s favorite character? I\u2019ve inadvertently been talking about my favorite characters in seemingly every anime I\u2019ve watched so I\u2019ve decided I may as well just blatantly point out my favorite in every review. In Clannad I found myself being drawn to Tomoyo.\\n\\n\r\nTomoyo is awesome. She\u2019s cute as hell, she\u2019s smart as hell, and she\u2019s a badass. She takes out two guys on motorcycles, scares criminals in town and beats them down if they make a move on her. She\u2019s the character that I enjoyed seeing and looked forward to seeing again.\\n\\n\r\nNot that any of the other characters made me want to look away. Tomoya is an asshole delinquent who likes to speak his mind and has not-so-great social skills in that regard. Which I can relate with. His love interest, Nagisa, is a kindhearted girl who just wants to reestablish the theater club. She is not a particularly annoying character, which is strange because girls like her I tend to hate. But she\u2019s genuinely likeable, as are her parents. Her father is probably my second favorite character in the show, a guy who is funny as hell, and serious as well.\\n\\n\r\nFuko is my third favorite character, a girl in a coma who somehow shows herself to the people of the school to invite them to her sister\u2019s wedding. She is funny, cute, and a character with a sad background but a likeable disposition.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters include Tomoya\u2019s best friend, an unlikeable asshole who tries to get girls but ultimately fails. A nerdy, antisocial girl with a terrible past appears later on. And quite a few more people who are all likeable in some respect or other make appearances throughout. It is rare for me to tell you there are no bad characters in a show, but in the case of Clannad, none of the characters are bad. They all play roles, and they are all good company for twenty-two (twenty-four if you count the OVA\u2019s) episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI hate it when I have nothing to really complain about in my reviews. It makes me feel unprofessional when I just tell you something\u2019s good and I don\u2019t nitpick it to death. But in the case of Clannad, it is good. It\u2019s great as a matter of fact.  Character makes a romance what it is, and this series does a hell of a job with the characters. The dialogue is both funny and dramatic, the mood is great. It\u2019s just a fun series to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to complain about one thing, it\u2019s the final OVA, an alternate timeline where Tomoya and Tomoyo are dating. I liked this so much more than the ending where he tells Nagisa he loves her. I felt that the twenty-three minutes we get of Tomoyo and Tomoya\u2019s relationship are much better fleshed out then the whole series of Nagisa and Tomoya. I know I may get flack for this, but I feel that Nagisa and Tomoya did have a great relationship brewing, but there was very little hardship in the way and whatever hardship did come were outside influences that didn\u2019t affect the relationship. The way Nagisa acts during the first OVA, I have no idea if she is just completely oblivious to how relationships and dating works, or she just is not that tight with Tomoya. The final OVA with Tomoyo is so cute beyond belief that I nearly cried at the end. Tomoyo comes across as even more likeable and Tomoya comes across as a really caring guy.\\n\\n\r\nSo as far as I\u2019m concerned, I prefer TomoyaxTomoyo over TomoyaxNagisa. Sorry Nagisa fans.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the series is good. Romance fans should watch it, as well as those up for a good drama.",

            "content": "Review in brief: Clannad, especially in this first season, is a free-spirited, slow-burning, and ultimately romantic slice-of-life. It is a mish-mash of whimsical, childish humors and melodramatic, yet sometimes ethereal reflections & revelations. While it is overly immature at times and is overall lacking in substance & consistency, it has one aspect that allows the whole season to resonate when viewed under the right lens; that it is wholly emblematic of the end of adolescence.\r\nReview part I ~ the underlying story:\r\nThis is a difficult season of anime to separate from its series to discuss standalone. The standard visual novel adaptation setup and abundance of commonrom-com tropes don\u2019t make it clear what Clannad is or where it\u2019s going. Clannad is so named due to a misunderstanding about the Gaelic word for family, but much of this season focuses on high-school events. The series as a whole is known and often judged by its reputation as the poster-child of \u201canime that will make you cry\u201d, but many will find this season\u2019s heaviest moments to be melancholic at most.\\n\\n\r\nBefore getting into the meat of this anime, one must leave their pre-conceived notions at the door. Strangely fitting as it is, this is a teenage Clannad on display. It struggles with self-reliance and often fails to heed the criticisms surrounding its ilk. Yet the patient and caring observer will be able to see that it is isn\u2019t done preparing itself for that fateful first step out the door and that its strengths, though not fully realized, see it capable of admirable deeds in the right circumstances. All of this is readily apparent right out the gate in the first episode\u2019s first scene.\\n\\n\r\nClannad opens with its protagonist, the troubled delinquent Tomoya Okazaki, at the bottom of the hill his high-school sits atop. He despises his lot in life, and is convinced he has good reasons to feel that way. At the foot of the hill stands another student, Nagisa Furukawa, and her optimistic yet uncertain demeanor plays an odd contrast to Tomoya\u2019s assured negativity. Nagisa suddenly exclaims her favorite food of all things, sparking a brief conversation that Tomoya passes off as inconsequential as he begins climbing the hill.\\n\\n\r\nNow a critical thinker who is versed in this medium and its genres will see ample reasons to say \u201cI\u2019ve seen this countless times before\u201d, \u201cI bet he meets the tsundere next\u201d, or perhaps \u201cthey should have just called this Kanon II\u201d. They truly can\u2019t be blamed either; these are indeed all valid responses to an opening as standard as this. It\u2019s an unfortunate truth, as in this scene also resides the very spirit that comes to define Clannad. It can be seen in Nagisa\u2019s silly introductory line inciting enough curiosity to get Tomoya to listen further. It can be seen in Tomoya\u2019s assuredness being given to Nagisa in response despite his negativity. It can be seen in the very hill the scene takes place on, as it\u2019s not just a part of the school or even just the town, but a part of life, one that Tomoya has unwittingly began climbing. All of that is thematically referenced throughout the series. Though it\u2019s hard to tell from the get-go, there is an underlying yet overarching story layered within the otherwise typical high-school + supernatural shenanigans Jun Maeda is known for.\\n\\n\r\nThis persistent usage of typical & expected events as a vehicle to deliver deeper connected meanings is both Clannad\u2019s greatest strength and biggest weakness. Not many of these events are as layered and few still are as important as the scene at the foot of the hill, but a lot of Clannad\u2019s scenes, despite how uninspired they may appear on the surface, often carry a piece of the underlying story that ties the romance, drama, and childish comedy together. The supernatural elements of the story often act as the visible strands, especially the \u201cillusionary world\u201d that seems to represent occasional dreams yet seeps its way into surface-level events. It all makes Clannad accessible to younger viewers without -necessarily- being too shallow and pointless for a more mature audience. However, the overarching story encompasses the whole of Clannad, not just this season, so the viewer\u2019s focus will tend to be set more on the standard high-school rom-com on the surface than the layered and slightly supernatural drama that only begins here.\\n\\n\r\nReview part II ~ the surface story:\\n\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve implied thus far, the surface-level story is childish, clunky, and doesn\u2019t tell much that hasn\u2019t been told better elsewhere. It follows Tomoya\u2019s interactions with a standard harem\u2019s variety of girls as he helps sort out their problems and gets to know more about them in turn. It\u2019s a setup that heavily relies on characters to make a worthwhile experience, and Clannad\u2019s cast is not properly balanced for this. Tomoya himself is a fairly competent individual whose strengths and flaws often come into play as he goes through each arc (though his development is rather light in this season). The side cast has a number of effective foils for Tomoya and the main girls (like Nagisa\u2019s father Akio who is always putting on acts and Tomoya\u2019s friend Sunohara whose loud and careless demeanor gets him in frequent trouble) who occasionally give the anime a quirky charm.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Clannad fumbles the handling of its main girls, which is where a lot of its problems truly lie. The common complaint is that the majority of them act more like children than budding adults. It\u2019s something that the characters in question have reasons for inside the story, but nonetheless severely hampers their development and ultimately the quality of their surface-story arcs. There\u2019s Nagisa (whose mystery illness plays a role in her arrested social development), Kotomi (the quiet autistic savant; not that she displays a whole lot of intelligence in the story, but she certainly displays a complete lack of social skills), and Fuuko (basically a loud Kotomi with an obsession towards starfish and no claimed savantism. Her actual reason for being childish is a spoiler).\\n\\n\r\nNagisa does get enough development to be tolerable thanks to having her arc come later and from her more central story role as the heart of the drama club used to connect the story segments. However, the early arcs of Fuuko & Kotomi do nothing to make them hold any purpose beyond being shallow copies of previous Key characters. Those of you who have seen Kanon probably already know which characters they're copies of, and their arcs are copied almost as much (the differences being that all that made those two characters in Kanon meaningful is torn out and forgotten). For those of you who have seen Air, I\u2019ll have to get back with you after I\u2019ve seen it. With arcs that are mostly inferior recycled versions of previous Key arcs that only have Clannad\u2019s underlying story to keep things interesting (unless melodrama, meme pranks, and repeat jokes can hold you over) there is no consequential rebuttal for the criticisms leveled against these characters.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the comedy, the majority of it comes off as shallow filler, especially when it comes to padding out Fuuko & Kotomi\u2019s arcs. While some of it can be quirky depending on what characters are involved, much of it amounts to childish teasing and memery. Simple humor for simple minds essentially. The real issue is that there\u2019s more of it early on than later, so while Fuuko & Kotomi\u2019s arcs get enough time to have made substantial surface-level developments, too much time ends up getting spent on cheap humor for that to happen.\\n\\n\r\nAfter those two drawn-out arcs, the next arc does the opposite and crams two main girls\u2019 (three if you count Ryou as a main girl, though the attention she gets is lacking enough to make this debatable) development into a shorter arc than the last two. There\u2019s plenty of indications that Kyou & Tomoyo have more character than is initially presented, but little of it is delved into. Even the OVAs these characters received later don\u2019t fully patch the holes this season makes in their development. This leaves the last arc (Nagisa\u2019s) as the only arc where the pacing works. For what her rather standard dandere character is worth, she gets enough serious moments (including more that tie into the underlying story) to at least make her arc better than the others. So long as Nagisa herself doesn\u2019t bug you it\u2019s likely to be the best part of the season.\\n\\n\r\nReview part III ~ all in all:\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end, what this season has to offer plot-wise is the beginning of a supernatural drama which is tied into a poorly-paced and overall shallow high-school rom-com (until the last arc anyhow). However, before reaching a conclusion there is a need to discuss the production values, which as has come to be expected from Kyoto Animation is top-notch for the late 2000\u2019s and holds up strong today.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Key\u2019s huge-eyed character art style isn\u2019t quite seamlessly integrated in this season, the overall picture quality is high and there\u2019s a lot of smooth animation in place, especially for a story sourced from a visual novel. There\u2019s also an impressive amount of detail put into the background art, which combined with the skilled use of filters allows the visuals alone to instantly set the mood, something the poorly paced story ends up relying on. The \u201cillusionary world\u201d scenes are particularly well made. The completely hand-drawn girl in the mostly CG world works astonishingly well, and the CG designs are so fitting that they hardly feel dated more than 10 years later.\\n\\n\r\nEver better than the visuals is the sound quality. In the Japanese dub, the skilled voicework gives the characters a more down-to-earth vibe than the silly comedy and abundance of melodrama would typically allow, which goes a long way in keeping things grounded enough for the underlying story to matter when it comes in between the surface shenanigans. As for the music, well, let\u2019s just say I respect Jun Maeda much more as a composer than as a writer. It\u2019s surprising how easily his music can instantly create a mood, even when it\u2019s as simplistic as Clannad\u2019s soundtrack. It\u2019s been said that perfection is when there is nothing left to take away, and while I\u2019m not the sort to throw that word around lightly there is so little that could be removed from Clannad\u2019s pieces that the aforementioned saying instantly comes to mind when I listen to one of them.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with all of that said and done, is Clannad worth your time? It\u2019s always a tough call when I\u2019m asked this, but the biggest decider is typically how patient the asker is. As cheesy of a rom-com as Clannad\u2019s first season is, it\u2019s not just a rom-com when you step back. Much like how the end of a budding adult\u2019s education makes for a beginning more than it does an end, Clannad is only getting started here. This is not the end of yet another melodramatic romance, but the beginning of something far grander, the likes of which rarely show up in this medium or any other. While the stale exterior is not excusable, the story\u2019s core does add a considerable value to the experience even before it\u2019s been fully developed. It still is able to make some otherwise melodramatic moments work even if you don\u2019t connect with the characters and even makes some of the jokes ring clearer.\\n\\n\r\nClannad is not a fair-weather friend; it needs to be tolerated through thick and thin to be truly appreciated. Perhaps that description doesn\u2019t sound very inviting for an anime, something often seen as entertainment first and foremost, and it\u2019s not supposed to be. Even so, if you\u2019ve read this far and haven\u2019t experienced Clannad for yourself it wouldn\u2019t hurt much to try out an episode or two. It won\u2019t take long to figure out if you can tolerate Clannad\u2019s faults or not. If you can\u2019t there\u2019s no harm in leaving it be and moving on, as skipping to After Story doesn\u2019t even get you all the way past the story\u2019s shakier portion and you\u2019ll have missed too much to understand what makes the actual After Story what it is. If you can, however, you could easily find something so special that it changes your outlook on life.",

            "content": "I've always thought that Kyoto Animation productions were unfairly overestimated, that's probably because they overshadow the superficial. And Clannad represents one of these mysterious phenomena of popularity, it can be frankly said that it attracts the curiosity of seeing so many people and mainly fans of Key studio to clone it to this point, as if it were a revelation of modern science.\r\nFirst of all, the content should be judged before we can judge the form and I would be far from asserting that the harem subgenus is very eloquent, it is a typical pattern that has been profound for a number of years inthe field of japanimation, certainly to fill a great deal of frustration in some otaculs.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the most abnormal aspect of this casting anime, I have the impression that the protagonist is getting along with compelling copies, not girls in the right sense, but grotesque cartoons who pay for a constipated trunk. The nasty and disruptive chara-design is certainly the greatest purge to have to endure during these 23 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe good guy to be an offender with no significant traits aside from the fact that he exists and does not provide any integration effort, still succeeds in forming a harem, which is more logical to tell me. It is worth believing that it produces a lot of pheromones per second. It is grinning to see that the personality of the girls is under-exploiting and is only anodized by the stereotype. Then some of them are so neglected that I do not even see the interest of introducing them.\\n\\n\r\nThe frame is therefore always there to radiate the same narrative processes, and its characters are so incapacitated to move that, in the end, a wall may be afflicted by so many absurdities. Thus, during 23 episodes such as death, we will be able to color humorous sketches without the slightest subtility in mind, with the famous sidekick of the hero, only arousing a deep dingy, translated into a great cosmic nothingness.\\n\\n\r\nSo it is better to suicide than to sue such torture.",

            "content": "I see I big divide as to whether people enjoy this show or not. A lot of people see it as overrated or bad, while other people see it as a masterpiece. Before I had watched Clannad, I had never seen an anime so focused on romance. Not Angel Beats, not Kanon, not Your Lie in April, or anything else. This review is about an anime that is very close to my heart.\r\nNote that this review is specifically over Clannad and not After Story. While I personally consider them both to be two halves of the same story, this review only focuses on the firsthalf.\\n\\n\r\nThis review has a couple minor spoilers, such as the motives for some of the minor characters. However, these spoilers are minor, and I would not expect them to inhibit your enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nClannad builds on a formula used in many romantic anime. You have your male protagonist that is broken, sad, depressed, or maybe he simply lacks interest. So what is the cure for this condition? A woman of course! Yes, our main protagonist Tomoya Okazaki plans to waste his life away, and he has done a pretty good job of accomplishing that so far. Certain memories haunt him while he lives in a city that he would rather never see again. Then he meets Nagisa Furukawa, a shy girl whose illness prevented her from graduating from school. He pledges to help her pursue her dream of reviving the drama club.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the relationship between Tomoya and Nagisa is the main plotline of Clannad, we are given several other girls that are thrown into the mix, each with their own unique characteristics and problems. Several arcs consist of Tomoya interacting with these girls, and helping them find resolution with their respective issues. Of these girls we have:\\n\r\n1. Fuko, a young girl that wishes to bring people to her sister's wedding by giving out wooden starfish as invitations. \\n\r\n2. Tomoyo, a tough and strong-willed girl who wishes to be student council president as a means to save cherry blossom trees outside the school, of which she has sentimental value. \\n\r\n3. Kotomi, a brilliant girl with a lack of social skills, who has a past she would rather forget about. \\n\r\n4. The twins, Kyou and Ryou! Ryou is a shy girl with an obvious crush on Tomoya, and Kyou is a bad mouthed, short tempered girl, who may or may not also have feelings for Tomoya. As likeable as they are, neither of them have their own arc. This sends them to the back seat as supporting characters for most of the series, but they still get time to develop as the show progresses. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason why Tomoya must interact with all of these ladies lies in that this anime is an adaptation of a visual novel. In the novel, choices are made that will lead to Tomoya developing a romance with any of the female supporting characters. But in an anime, the protagonist can't date all of the ladies, right? (*cough* School Days *cough*)\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Clannad has a very hard time breaking apart from its visual novel roots. The story begins and finishes arcs featuring Tomoya and one of the girls almost systematically. This cookie cutter formula may lead to boredom for some, simply because it's not as thrilling as an anime that is always changing directions. The story of Clannad moves in a straight line, while making pit stops along the way...so to speak.     \\n\\n\r\nClannad tends to take a step back from the spot light to make room for the arcs between Tomoya and his harem of supporting characters, which is my biggest problem with the show. I find this bothersome because, well, Nagisa is the heroine. Shouldn't we be caring the most about her regardless of what is going on? Well, not exactly, but you get my point. While her relationship with Tomoya, as well as herself as a character, develops appropriately, it just never really is the focal point. Nagisa still, overall, has the most screen time of any of the other girls. This helps cushion this issue a bit, since she always is at least near the spotlight.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as sound goes, everything is at least on par. There are two songs in particular that tend to bring me tears when I listen to them. Still, it is unlikely that you will become attached to the songs if you are not attached to the anime itself. Most of the soundtrack is simply an adaptation to the songs in the visual novel however, and I find that to cut the soundtrack some slack.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation gets its job done. Nothing overly spectacular...EXCEPT FOR ONE THING. Throughout the course of the show, we are given a side story. Fantastic 3D graphics are one of the highlights of these scenes, adding to the mysterious setting...\\n\\n\r\nAbout the actual side story, it revolves around a young girl and a robot doll that are trapped all alone in a strange world. They seek both to be with each other and to escape from the decaying world they are in. Scenes featuring the story are scattered among the series. I can't say what they mean or what they are about. That is for the viewer to discover. However, It is important to pay attention to this side story, as well as its correlation to the main plot. It may prove beneficial later.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one thing that needs to be made absolutely clear: This is slice of life anime, but it does have a little bit of magic, or supernatural, or whatever you want to call it. It's just a tiny little bit, but if this is not made clear, you may be disappointed if that sort of thing is not your cup of tea.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I can't really write this review without mentioning After Story. You should not watch Clannad just so you can reach its magical second season. Clannad shouldn't be treated as a stumbling stone that prevents the viewer from experiencing a good story. Clannad is good. It's great! Immerse yourself in the world of Clannad as well as you can. The characters you will meet and grow attached to are the same as the ones you will meet in After Story. And if you watch Clannad only to dislike it, you very well may dislike After Story as well. However, if your only reason for disliking Clannad was its lack of focus on the relationship between Tomoya and Nagisa, as well as its large focus on the supporting characters, you should be pleased with After Story.\\n\\n\r\nClannad was something completely different than anything I had ever seen, and it will always be something very close to my heart. I will recommend it to anyone looking for a gateway into the genre, as it was my gateway. \\n",

By the time I watched the second series 'Clannad: After Story' my defenses were so low that holding back tears was impossible. If you're not rooting for Nagisa and Tomoya to confess at the end I don't know what to say. They are one the most enjoyable characters that you want to end up together I have ever shipped. It's story is very heavy at times and to say it's a tear jerker is an understatement. The animation is very pleasing and it's just overall a very enjoyable and well played out piece. Nearly everycharacter has a backstory and has enough personality to be enjoyed that you don't mind when time is spent on them. It's definitely a watch if you ever just want to get your emotions out and you haven't cried in awhile.",

Because its profoundly beautiful and I am always short of words or rather there exists no words to Define the Beauty which the writer presents and the series brings out in the anime to us readers. Its complete bliss, a treat to the eyes if you ask me.\r\nClannad is the one of the most beautiful Romantic anime out there even after more than 10 years have passed by. It is the anime whichhas the potential to grab the interested of even the densest among all people.It even grabs interest and replenishes ones love for romantic anime's even after they exhausted from watching those things again and again. How do I know? Because it helped me in the same kind of case(LOL).\\n\r\nThe character design is remarkable, the graphics are top notch for the year they were produced and continues to rival the new one's till date.It has an outstanding Music record and looks as if perfect music is chosen for each of the scenes.\\n\r\nBut my only complain is that the Story in general needed some personal touch because the characters felt like 2D characters and quite distant unless there was not a Emotional Scene such as \"Reunion of Kotomi and Tomoya\" in Kotomi's backyard.Theses are the kinds of scenes we cry for and live for.\\n\r\nExcept for that I don't see a reason why the anime shouldn't be popular!!!\\n\r\nIf I have to define the anime in one sentence they I would say \"Love is in the Air\",such is the exotic beauty of the Breath taking Clannad which is \"one in a million\" kind of anime.\\n\r\nTo inspire each other through the beauty of Art is to live.\\n",

            "content": "As much as I consider myself to be casual anime viewer. I don't have any particular interest in light novel. Clannad is based upon light novel of the same name by KEY which is famous for many other visual novels and there anime adaptations such as(Kannon, Air, little Buster etc). Clannad is considered as one the best anime out there. So let's get to the review:\r\nStory:\r\nClannad follows the story of Okazaki Tomoya who is a high school student and he is also a delinquent with no interest. He mostly skips school and spends time at his friend Sunohara dorm. One day he meets a girlat the school gate who is muttering to herself her name if Nagisa Furukawa he befriends her and finds the she is very sensitive and often becomes so she has to skip school often. Then frome there the story goes on as were are introduced to rest of his friends and the story goes on. For me the story of clannad is very good but after some time it gets boring in the middle as there are a lot of girls but the main girl of the story is nagisa and her dream to revive the drama club. When the characters are introduced and we find out about there past and the tragic story behind this is where it truly shines. Clannad tells us an emotional tale about life and its pros and cons. Well clannad is not the best anime out there and many may disagree with me on this but it tells a good story well what can i say pretty much half of it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nClannad has some pretty interesting characters as every character has its own personality and traits. Now clannad left much of the information out there as many of the characters did not get properly introduced and leaves much to the imagination of the viewer. Well i can say that most of the girls have their own personality except most of them love tomoya. As a visual Novel adaptation it is pretty normal.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Art:\\n\r\nSound is also one the department in which clannad in truly amazing as some the tracks are emotional and heart breaking to relaxing. Clannad did not had a long list of soundtracks but the ones it has are pretty amazing. As far as the art and animation goes clannad was adapted by kyoto animation and if you have any one of there anime you know that the pretty amazing in this field.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\r\nClannad is an amazing anime if you love romantic, slice of life shows with a supernatural twist to it. yes it can get boring at some times but the real meat of the show comes at the and with the continuation in the second season it is definitely worth watching.",

The little songs which aren't romantic are pretty interesting as well and every song is well placed and appropriate for thesituation. The opening is very nice, and though the ending isn't rly appropriate for this kind of atmosphere, it suits this show.\\n\r\nThe characters are just amazing, it's not rly the usual harem setting and every character has it's own unique catching points:D. There are many different girls, so it's sure that there are at least 2 characters you'll surely like;).\\n\r\nIn terms of enjoyment, this show can hardly be beaten, you can watch it in a row without a break and your don't get bored. At the end of every ep. you can't await the next ep., and no ep. will disappoint you.\\n\r\nOverall this show is one of the best ones you will be able to find and it's sure that you'll enjoy Clannad:D.",

            "content": "The TV version of Clannad, an adaptation of the game by Key (Visual Arts), combines all the plot lines one goes through in the game, and weaves them together into a storyline that has a complete balance of drama and comedy weaved like a quilt of realism. Each of the characters comes into the story with their own issues to dealt with. Even the main protagonist, Tomoya Okazaki, has his own excess baggage as he starts a new club including the bulk of the other characters in this show.\r\nThe main characters, who have a stock character quality, drive the presentation just like when you playthe game itself. You've got your slapstick captain in Youhei Sunohara, who is a frequent victim to Tomoyo fixes of his perversion and advances. You have a little insertion of Fuko intervening every now and then, after her arc is complete, to spice the rest of the episodes up. You have your tsundere girl in Kyou Fujibayashi, and your shy, unassuming, yet emotional girl in Kotomi. There is also the athletically talented, but ruthlessly brutal, Tomoyo Sakagami. And the development of Tomoya's character and the way he handles the situations of each of the female protagonists is key to the direction.\\n\r\nAt the same time, the storyline is akin to gastronomical treasures of Europe: you savor it as you consume it. From Nagisa's illness; to Fuko's intentions to invite strangers to her sister's wedding; to Kotomi mourning the loss of her parents...the background history of each character is studied in every episode, and viewers should pay close attention to the plot devices used to weave the threads around, as well as the overall relationship between Tomoya and Nagisa.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\n&quot;So, who did the art and in-betweens, and what have you?&quot;\\n\r\n&quot;Kyoto Animation, sir.&quot;\\n\r\n&quot;Who did you say did it? I couldn't hear you.&quot;\\n\r\n&quot;Kyoto Animation.&quot;\\n\r\n&quot;KyoAni? You mean the same crew that did your Haruhi Suzumiyas and Lucky Stars of the world?&quot;\\n\r\n&quot;Bingo.&quot;\\n\r\n&quot;Well! There you go.&quot; \\n\\n\r\nAll side talk aside, Clannad's biggest strengths lie in its art. The background scenes-from the streets, to the school rooms, to the shots of the sky during the day, afternoon, and night-are good use of pastels and colors to give a realistic feel to the mood of the story. Mention the words Kyoto Animation, and already it should be a rule to give the art review at least a 7.\\n\r\nKyoAni does not stray much from the original character designs and appearances in the game and the OVA. The hair designs have a sheer feel, and when the wind blows through (example is Kotomi Ichinose's locks), it adds a mystique to each character's charm. They sugar-coated things with the use of bright colors, but it's a small scratch.\\n\r\nIf you know how the facial expressions and tears are in The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, and even in Lucky Star, then the expressions in Clannad should look familiar. What I find interesting is the generous use of tears when the characters have pained looks on their faces. It's an example of their vulnerability, and viewers can relate, one way or another, to what they have gone through.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe Japanese cast for Clannad is a delectable blend of who's who. For the main cast, you have Mai Nakahara (Mai Tokiha, My-Otome) doing the voice work for Nagisa Furukawa; Ai Nonaka (Kafuka Fura from Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, Konoka Konoe from Negima!) as Fuko Ibuki; Akemi Kanda (Asuna Kagurazaka from Negima!) as Ryou Fujibayashi; Ryo Hirohashi (Alice Carroll from Aria, Konata Izumi from the Lucky Star Radio Drama, Sora Naegino from Kaleido Star, etc.) as Kyou Fujibayashi; Houko Kuwashima (Maroon from Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne, Filia from Slayers Try, Sango from Inu-Yasha, etc.) as Tomoyo Sakagami; Mamiko Noto (Ana Coppola from Strawberry Marshmallow, Yukinari Sasaki from Girls Bravo, Aya Toujou from Ichigo 100%, Nodoka Miyazaki from Negima!, etc.) as Kotomi Ichinose; and Daisuke Sakaguchi (Shimira Shinpachi from Gintama) as Youhei Sunohara. For Yuuichi Nakamura, this would go down as one of his biggest roles yet, as Tomoya Okazaki. Among the secondary characters, the ubiquitous Yukari Tamura strikes again...as Youhei's little sister Mei. \\n\\n\r\nAnother plus for Clannad is the choice of situational music. The trio of Jun Maeda, Magome Togoshi, and Shinji Orito create a soundtrack for Clannad that conveys a globe of moods: from the uplifting and spirited, to the melancholy and poignant. Of course, they are not new to creating soundtrack to similar works: all three have done the soundtrack for Air, and Orito also did work on Kanon.\\n\r\nOn this soundtrack, there are pieces that match the characters' personas. For Kotomi, you have a small chamber orchestra piece. For Tomoyo, you have one that emphasized her athletic prowess. For Fuko, you have a playful, cheerful, fun piece. The centerpiece of this soundtrack are the recurring background tracks in each episode. \\n\r\nThe opening for Clannad is Megumeru ~cuckool mix 2007~, a remix of the song by eufonius. It's a soft, easy listen. Dango Daikazoku (The Big Dango Family) by Chata is an ED that starts off light and playful, but then expands into a holistic, powerful, yet assertively mothely anthem. The use of gongs in this song and the backing chorus adds a finishing touch to an already memorable ED.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\r\nAn anime that has excellent presentation is a memorable combination of solid art and visual detail, a complex storyline that requires careful direction, and a steadfast pair of voice acting and musical composition. Even if you have not played the game itself, the TV adaptation of Clannad would be a nice substitute, because in my book, it has all the qualities of excellent presentation.\\n\r\nKyoto Animation did, as always, a superb job directing each path of the game into the show, and all the members, including Kazumi Ikeda and Fumihiko Shimo, who directed the story plot and the animation, respectively, have made it their intention to raise the bar once again after the success of their prior works. With an all-star cast, a winning soundtrack, and another potent art/story blend that pays deep respect to all the paths of the game, they are well on their way.\\n\r\nClannad is a show that will make you think a lot about the value of life, and after watching the first episode, you will want to see the next one, and the one after that. Those who have played the game will want to see how the TV adaptation compares to the game. And those who haven't are in for a complete treat of the entire concept of the game without any corners cut. It's something that a lot of people will enjoy. I recommend it.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Being with friends is normal, but in this, true friendship is like a sun what shows everyday on the sky, it brights your day, making it more happier and more exiting. This is the feeling that Clannad gave to me, it tells about friendship, how friends can really make your day better, being alone is sad, being without a true friend, filled with sadness, it shuts you out from the world. You live in your own world, full with your own thoughts and thinks you think the things are.\r\nSo basically why I enjoyed this anime so much, is that it tells about making friends, hangingout with them, sharing the happy and sad moments, surviving in cruel world with friends. Story is beautifully written, not overdone anything or done too less something. I just like it's way to tell people, why the friends are for, and why you need them. It just makes this anime enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork is pretty good actually it's well focused on details and characters faces, it's detailedly told what mood the characters are: sad, happy etc. Also scenery is well done, accurately and carefully, just as I like it.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting, just wonderful, I really enjoyed how people's moods where by telling it with voice: when character's angry, voice is strong, loud and clear, when sad, it's broken and filled with sadness. Voice acting was great, made my cry few times, just so good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and their way of living is nicely told, there is enough introduce from almost every character. Told their problems, fears and dreams. So watching it made me happy, and I enjoyed how well it's been introduced.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, just wonderful! It made me feel like I'm in other world, that felt really great. I was sad some parts too, that's why it's good enjoyment, if you're watching it with full emotionally, it could make you feel little sad too, but when happy parts come, you feel happy too. It's like you follow the moods in the anime, and that makes it great.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall I say that everyone who likes drama balanced romance anime should watch this, it's full of beautiful parts that takes you to the other world.",

            "content": "Clannad was a show I was first very hesitant about watching as it had been recommended to me by a friend who if I'm honest does not have the best taste in anime. But in this case he was right to r coco end this show and it's equal.\r\nFirst will start off with the animation which looks amazing as you would expect from Kyoto Animation and is probably there best looking show along side Haruhi. The soundtrack for the show is also fantastic with favourite song being The Big Dango family which is played at the end of each episode. Now the characters and thisshow is a first for me as I liked every single character in the show. I have no issues with any of them what so ever with my favourite character being Nagisa as let's be honest she has got to be the cutest anime character ever and the nicest as well.\\n\\n\r\nI would go into the story but that would spoil things so all I will say about the story is that it will take you on a roller coaster ride of emotions of laughter and sadness so make sure you have a box of tissue at the ready as you will need them.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum up Clannad is one of the greatest anime I have ever seen but one thing maybe slightly better and that is its sequel After Story which I'm also doing a review for. But Clannad should be seen by every anime fan and if you haven't you may want to get on with that as you are missing out on a special anime.",

He gets more friends during the story till the end. There is not one big story but there's about 3 mini stories which is okay to me but one big story could have been better.\r\nSome characters are bland but some characters are interesting and unique. I think they didn't balance using different characters enough which makes it seem too bland and generic. I still like the characters and they are often very relatable. \r\nPlot is very nice and touching attimes but many times I felt it was getting repetitive. However, the humour is one of the greatest thing in this show, maybe even the best one out there.\\n\\n\r\nArt is one of the best I've seen. It's so colourful and animation is very fluid and variable unlike some bad animes that reuse animations. Music is also very memorable and cool.\\n\\n\r\nGreat slice of life anime, I recommend it.",

            "content": "Art, music and storytelling are all mediums that simply on their own, assuming they are done effectively, have the ability to illicit strong emotional responses and feelings from the people observing them. That\u2019s just on their own, when combined, as is the case with anime, it can be stunning; highly inspirational, heart-warming (or breaking). It can be an experience that changes your life even.\r\nTo give this rather general statement some context, Clannad uses all of these things together, of course it does, it\u2019s an anime. What I didn\u2019t state in the above paragraph, is that when the execution of these components is not in harmonyi.e. the art is amazing, the music is brilliant, but the storytelling is barely there, it ends up hurting the entire product. While I understand that art is very much a huge component in anime, it is not more important than the story it exists to represent. That\u2019s what lets Clannad down in the end, it\u2019s a high budget project with a pretty above average music score, but the story just isn\u2019t there. It\u2019s not, it\u2019s really not. \\n\\n\r\nClannad sets you up from the beginning with a pretty generous amount of central characters, most of whom contribute to the long list of things about Clannad that just aren\u2019t good enough. It pretty much fits the bill of your traditional harem set up, you have a central male lead and a bunch of girls who he gets to spend time with and get to know. But here\u2019s the thing: what you end up with is a bunch of guns that are never fired, they\u2019re just shown. The lead male Tomoya is very bland and very typical of the lead male character in this type of show. He\u2019s a delinquent, he thinks his life\u2019s not too great, he makes friends along the way (i.e. every single one of the girls) because friendship is this powerful thing that\u2019s almost unstoppable (which is the extent of the depth the show pushes by the way) etc. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are just as bad, if not worse. None of the characters behave, or sound, like the age range they\u2019re supposed to be and very little of the character interaction is realistic. Two of the characters, Fuuko and Kotomi, exhibit behaviour reminiscent of high functioning autistics, when it\u2019s pretty clear that\u2019s not the intention the writer\u2019s had going, making their characters very jarring and hard to tolerate. It\u2019s also worthy of note that once Fuuko\u2019s arc ends, she occasionally pops in every now and then as what seems like the world\u2019s worst deus ex machina, but just ends up being a \u201ccutesy\u201d little incident that ends up killing mood and momentum. Nagisa, the main focus of the romance, is your typically plain, overly nice girl who doesn\u2019t have a lot of self-confidence who grows as the show progresses thanks to all her new friends. Then there\u2019s two twins, Kyou and Ryou, Kyou is just a cookie cutter Tsundere and Ryou, ironically considering her twin character, shows the most dynamic in her character out of all of them, but is mostly written out as a side character (except when she, like pretty much all the other girls, is shown to have romantic feelings for Tomoya). Tomoyo pretty much fits in the Kuudere shell for the most part and Sunohara is the comic relief side-kick. \\n\\n\r\nWatching Clannad is like playing poker at a table where everyone has their cards turned face up except for you, but everyone else wants you to flip your cards over as well. You know that\u2019s not how poker is meant to be played, but it\u2019s a really easy way to play it. There\u2019s no surprises, no twists coming out of left-field and there\u2019s no fun. It\u2019s not immediately obvious at the start when all the characters are still being introduced, but once the story kicks in, it becomes pretty obvious what Clannad is trying to do. Every aspect of the story is so blatantly obvious and simple, so are it\u2019s very shameless attempts to tug at your heart strings. The score comes in handy here, since it\u2019s so well composed, never particularly cheesy, never over the top, nice and subtle and perfect at setting the mood the images and words before you are trying to accomplish. It\u2019s pretty easy to get into it that way and that\u2019s exactly why Clannad fails at a story. It\u2019s entirely mechanical, story writing 101. Episode 14 is the best example of what I\u2019m talking about, everything that you think is going to happen happens and in the exact way and order you think it\u2019s going to happen in. \\n\\n\r\nOften the story resorts to sudden changes in mood, shoehorning in an overly dramatic backstory to certain characters or incidents in the characters\u2019 lives like \u201cthen X was involved in a traffic accident\u201d or \u201cthen my X tried to kill themselves\u201d and it all boils back down to \u201cfriendship is strong enough to get through anything\u201d. Tomoya\u2019s rocky relationship with his father is like this as well. The moment it\u2019s introduced, it makes you go \u201coh, that\u2019s going to be his thing isn\u2019t it?\u201d not \u201cdamn, that\u2019s unfortunate, it\u2019ll be interesting to see where this goes\u201d. Everything is so obvious and so simple and yet instead of coming across as fun and whimsical and a little light-hearted, it comes across as contrived and boring. The show then has the audacity to have a go at trying its hand at a proper romance angle. Unfortunately, it leaves it far too late and plays itself out excruciatingly slowly while shoehorning in even more unnecessary, uninspiring and predictably boring sob stories. It doesn\u2019t improve in any way for the entirety of its running time, it doesn\u2019t get sadder, it get\u2019s unreasonable.\\n\\n\r\nFor nearly the entirety of its running time, Clannad tries to cover up its asinine story writing with decent, high budget animation, though not as remarkably as past Key/Kyoto collaborations, namely Air; clever scoring and jarring mood transitions that give it a \u201cdon\u2019t take me seriously, but actually do take me seriously\u201d mentality. If you are looking for a refreshing change in the slice of life genre, you won\u2019t find it here. If you\u2019re looking for a nice, heart-warming, well written romance story, try elsewhere. Clannad is a high budget anime, promising big but delivering clunky scenes, embarrassingly bad characters, ridiculous dialogue and a whole lot of disappointment.",

            "content": "I just want to remind you that this is NOT a damn harem. Tomoya may be surrounded by cute girls but it's not a harem. If you watch the show then you'll find out why. I have friends who didn't want to watch this show because of the animation and the fact that they thought this was a harem. \r\n[Story]: (8/10)\r\nTomoya Okazaki is a delinquent third-year high school student who doesn't like school and skips school along with Sunohara, his friend, and plans to waste his high school days away. One day, while walking to school, he passes a girl who was muttering under herbreath. Tomoya soon befriends that girl named Nagisa.\\n\r\nNagisa has a dream and it's to revive the school drama club. Tomoya helps her form the club along with the help of four other girls. \\n\\n\r\nI'm going to have to say that the story was overhyped and overrated by the fanboys and fangirls of this show. I didn't really see the story as a masterpiece. It's a good story but it's not something that needs to be praised. The series is divided into 3 arcs. The 1st arc is Fukko's arc, the 2nd arc is Kotomi's arc, and the 3rd arc is Nagisa/Drama Club Members arc. I honestly don't know the name of the 3rd arc so I guessed. Let's focus on the 1st arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe 1st arc is Fukko's arc. I'm going to be very honest here. This is the most disappointing arc out of the 3 arcs in Clannad. It dragged on for way too long(this arc had 6 episodes) and the show didn't give me a reason to care for Fukko. This arc really bored me to death so it took me at least 5 days just to finish Fukko's arc. That's pathetic because watching 10 episodes usually takes me a day or 2. Hell, I was even ready to drop the show but I wanted to see if the rest of the episodes are going to be as boring as this arc. The ending of this arc also disappointed me. You made me watch 6 boring episodes, later to find out that she has disappeared and they eventually forget her overall existence? What's the point? It's like the writer hated her that much that she was just thrown aside. She does make some cameo appearances later on during the 2nd and 3rd arc but only to disappear again after 3 minutes. \\n\\n\r\nThe 2nd arc is Kotomi's arc. Now, this arc....is one of the best I've seen in Clannad. It didn't bore me and it only lasted for 4 episodes which is a reasonable amount of episodes and it didn't felt rushed nor did it felt slow. This is actually the only arc that made me cry. After hearing what happened to Kotomi's parents and how she dealt with it, I just couldn't handle it. I just broke into tears. I was impressed by this arc so my plans on dropping the show was cancelled. It also developed Kotomi's character and this arc wasn't pointless like Fukko's arc which felt pointless and unnecessary. \\n\\n\r\nThe 3rd and final arc is Nagisa/Drama Club Members arc. This is, honestly, the best arc out of the 3. It's filled with humorous moments, introduces some new characters, it further developed the friendship of Tomoya and Nagisa which is the main focus, some love triangle moments between Tomoya and the girls, the struggles to revive the drama club, Tomoya and his father, Nagisa's past, and more. It's filled with perfect dramatic moments that it deserves to be called best arc for this show. I would have wished they gave Kyou, Ryou, and Tomoyo some more screentime.  \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is ok for Ep. 10 - Ep. 23 but the first 10 episodes was boring. I understand why the first 4 episodes was boring (introducing the characters) but Fukko's arc was just too boring to watch.\\n\r\n I don't really want to spoil the ending of Clannad but all I have to say is....It's satisfying and it left me with a happy note on my heart. I just love Tomoya and Nagisa's \"friendship\".\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe animation for it's time is great. The only part of animation that I was bothered by is their shining, angled, big eyes. It eventually grew into me after a couple of episodes. There are 3 characters that looked almost identical which is Kyou, Kotomi, and Tomoyo. I can tell Kyou and Ryou apart even though their twins but sometimes Kyou and Kotomi confuses me. I also get confused with Kyou and Tomoyo sometimes. When I first watched the show, I thought Tomoyo was Kyou and the other way around but the opening constantly reminded me that the girl with the gray hair is Tomoyo and the girl with the purple hair is Kyou. For its time, the environment looked great and the character design looks great too. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (8/10)\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"Megumeru\" by eufonius and the ED theme song is \"Dango Daikazoku\" by Chata. At first, the OP theme song sounded great to me but after 3-4 episodes, it became very annoying real fast so I decided to skip the opening for the rest of the series. I didn't really like the ED theme song. Sure, it sounded cute but it just wasn't my taste. In short, the series had a lackluster OP and ED theme song but it does make up for it with a great background theme that fits perfectly with the corresponding scene that is being played. \\n\\n\r\nI watched the show in English Dub so I'm going to review the English VA. In my opinion, they did a decent job. There are times where they sound monotonic and there are also times where the voices sound off. Kyou's VA sounds like an old woman but i eventually got used to it. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Characters]: (8/10)\\n\r\nThe characters in the show are a 50/50. You either like them or you hate them. Some of them are great and some of them aren't. For example, some people like Fukko and some people like me don't. The show didn't give me enough reasons as to why I should care for her. Tomoya befriends her and suddenly, we get slapped with a dramatic backstory. It's not even that developed. What's worse is she was just thrown aside after her arc was finished. She instead makes cameo appearances to remind the viewers that she still exists. She sometimes ruins the serious argument that is happening. I wonder why Kotomi's backstory worked and Fukko's backstory didn't? Oh, I know. You can't just introduce a goddamn character and all of a sudden, have some tragic backstory inserted into that character. Kotomi's tragic backstory makes sense and there's also a reason why she has that \"loner\" personality. There has to be little unnoticeable/noticeable hints from the start so it doesn't feel like they just threw in that backstory to make the viewers cry.  \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (8/10)\\n\r\nAll in all, I did enjoy the show but I'm going to have to avoid the first 10 episodes if I ever want to watch this show again. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (8.2/10)\\n\r\nI really wanted to give this show a 10 or a 9 but that means I'd be lying to myself. In reality, it's not a masterpiece show. Hell, I might love After Story more than this show. Overall, it's a good show to watch but not a masterpiece. Kitomi's arc was very sad and the last arc is depressing/sad and happy at the same time. Fukko's arc doesn't deserve a mention. If you're looking for a dramatic/comedy show then this is the show for you. Just drink some coffee during the first 10 episodes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Well-done story\\n\r\n+Great Animation\\n\r\n+Good Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Great Characters\\n\r\n+Filled with humorous moments\\n\r\n+Dramatic moments\\n\r\n+Satisfying Ending\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Fukko's arc dragged on for way too long\\n\r\n-Some overused jokes\\n\r\n-Kyou, Ryou, and Tomoyo didn't get enough screentime\\n\\n\\n",

If you are one of those people who literally hates anything that is not similar to DBZ or Bleach, then do not watch it, because its nothing like either of those. However to people who do enjoy a good laughor a heart gripping story, I would say this most definitely is the anime for you!",

Yet you were brought joy from having the single friend near you, and the simple act of trying to make your dreams comme true with that friend by your side was enough to give you a point...\r\n  Clannad, on the surface, may seem like any other school-days romance, with a slight bit of comedy thrown in. But in truth its much more than that. A beautiful story, reaching to the very depth of every type of love and caring imaginable--whether that between friends, between families and between thosespecial people--is one that will make you cry out of both sadness and joy.\\n\r\n  It focuses on a boy, a delinquent, who had let his life fall to ruin after his mother died and he injured his arm in a fight with his father, spoiling his dreams of becoming a proffessional basketball player. Yet he finds a new dream, in helping out those around him, most importantly, Nagisa Furukawa, a young lonely girl who wishes to rebuild the drama club and has a certain obsession with something by the name of 'The Big Dango Family\" (which the ending theme song is actually after).\\n\r\n  Through the moments of discovering dreams and working to make them true many friendships are made, and many hearts are healed. It is a beautiful heartwarming tale that approaches many issues that people has and, through them all, speaks of the hope that can be acheived and the beauty of life created by those who travel through life with us.\\n\r\n  I would reccomend it to everyone! It really is a must see!",

            "content": "I'm note particularly into the whole moe thing and this was actually my first moe.\r\nImpression:\r\nStarting out, this anime seemed a little awkward how our main protagonist Tomoya Okazaki meets our leading female protagonist Nagisa Furukawa, I don't know how but it felt pretty awkward at first but I guess they had to meet somehow and the anime revolves around their relationship will Tomoya meets other female characters and helps them with their problems.\r\nThis wasn't particularly a bad show, it had decant character development from Tomoya as we get to further get to know him and understand him. This show also had it's fair share ofgood moments with some that did feel a little dry but the Characters did manage to brighten things up and keep things rolling, however this anime isn't quite complete without after story, mainly because there are these sequences that take place in a fantasy word between a girl and a robot made out of junk which is beautifully animated, though the show does do it's best to somewhat  make sense out of it and you could just leave it at there but this does continue into after story.\\n\r\nA major complaint I had was that there was some filler or the show didn't use some of it's time very well so there are some episodes that may seem completely pointless but that was my only real complaint. \\n\r\nsadly I didn't really cry like people said I would which was kind of a disappointment but I might have been expecting some real tear jerking moments when I heard this anime will make me cry.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nTomoya was like your typical harem protagonist and was a little dull but I under stood why they made him that way so the audience could sort of insert themselves into the story but also Tomoya was just a normal guy and sometimes served as a rational voice of reason but was bit of a plot device at times, however he did have his own issues which made him interesting.\\n\r\nNagisa is a shy girl but with awesome parents and to me wasn't all that interesting, however when the time came she was able to hold things down when needed.\\n\r\nThe first character I want to note is probably the one everyone else remembers from this anime...\\n\r\nFuko, who is a cute little green haired girl with a lot of energy and an obsession with starfish. This character like many of the other character in this show served a more comical purpose and Fuko defiantly delivers, though after her story arc I was a little confused but you might see what I mean.\\n\r\nThen there is Akio Furakawa AKA Nagisa's father, I could also mention her mother as well as these two go great together but Akio was something else. Akio is your typical protective father with a decent sense of humor and he kinda grew on me after a wile.\\n\r\nLastly there is Tomoyo Sakagami, the badass chick with the long hair.\\n\r\nEnough said.\\n\\n\r\nSub vs. Dub\\n\r\nA lot of people told me to watch this subbed first and so I did, and then I watched it dubbed.\\n\r\nMy ideas were that in terms of script they were roughly the same, the subtitles don't usually get it right any way so I pretty much got the same vibe from both though I don't feel particularly strong about either one, but there were some characters I like better in english and some I liked better in Japanese.\\n\r\nLike Fuko was more of a spontaneous character and she was a bit more energetic in english as she was voiced by Hilary Hag who later voiced yui in angel beats.\\n\r\nThe other character I like in english was Nagisa's father who was voiced by Andrew Love who usually pulls off the badass protective father character very well and I seemed to notice him more in the english version.\\n\r\nIn japanese I liked Tomoyo (the badass chick) because she sounded more like a badass in japanese however the same would go for english so I kinda liked her in both I guess.\\n\r\none character I didn't like in both was Tomoya's friend Youhei which sounded annoying in both versions. As for the rest, I could really care less which language it's in.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict:\\n\r\nI would have to give this anime a 6\\n\r\nmainly because it wasn't particularly the worst anime but it felt like a typical store that might have been done before but this anime does have some good moments but I would suggest taking your time with this one and there was some filler.",

You're observing the lives of the characters and how things occur. It's very nice but I must admit there are some tear jerking moments. They really like to push drama. If you've got an iron heart then just watch it. If ya got a glass heart,this one might break ya. It's a lovely story none the less. Just watch it. If it's not for you then just be on your merry way, but if it is, then be prepared for a great journey of life and love. See you in the After Story. =]",

            "content": "Story: 1\r\nI have been trying to get through this anime because I was told that Clannad was really captivating. My friends told me it is really sad and that I would be bawling within a few episodes. After 12 episodes I can say that this is one of the worst things I've ever seen. Nothing has happened so far besides uninteresting characters doing uninteresting things. More things would have happened in Naruto than Clannad.\r\nArt: 1\r\nAll the characters have a ridiculous amount of space between their eyes and makes it unpleasing to look at.\r\nSound: 7\r\nIn this sea of garbage, my only solace is that the musicfits the surrounding and the voice acting works with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1\\n\r\nI don't think I have ever come across such awful characters in watching anime or live action shows. Every character is so boring and unbelievable it astounds me.\\n\\n\r\nWe have our main character Okazaki Tomoya, who could not be more boring than a sack of potatoes. Holding true to the title of delinquent, he skips school... wait is that it? He goes around and gets a lame harem full of other boring chicks that no one wants to hang out with and helps them by... whatever he does.\\n\\n\r\nWe have Nagisa, who... is the main love interest for some reason, but other than that does nothing besides get the ball rolling for Okazaki to help people. She also likes a big dango family, whatever that means.\\n\\n\r\nWe have Kotomi who is a genius but lacks any and all social skills and when Okazaki is able to get her to introduce herself to people she has this awkward line she keeps repeating, believe it! No but seriously it's pretty bad. And staying true to the whole harem genre, she does not Okazaki from the past but conveniently he does not remember.\\n\\n\r\nWe have Ryou and Kyou, their names are so similar I never remember which one is which but one of them keeps hitting Okazaki with her moped and he seems to be perfectly okay with it and the other one is shy, just like the 2 other shy chicks in Okazaki's harem.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\r\nYou can probably tell that I have not enjoyed this so far.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1\\n\r\nSo yeah, this anime is pretty bad, how it's so highly rated, I'll never know.\\n",

            "content": "Story- 8/10\r\nOkazaki: \"We start to climb up... the long... long uphill climb\"\r\nThe story of Clannad had a real charm to it. With Clannad being an adaptation of a visual novel, (where the sole objective was to romance the different female characters), it is natural that Okazaki Tomoya (the main character) was going to be assaulted by a bunch of easily romanced young women. As forced as this sounds on paper, every story arc flowed with a natural and genuine quality. In each story arc, we were able to see each and every angle of the character in question. They would normally be introduced with ahilarious ice breaker episode. Their actual character would then start to flesh out in the next few episodes, where finally, Okazaki would pick up on their life struggles. An emotionally driven and incredibly powerful final episode would thus bring an end to their worries, which would be concluded with a heartfelt closing scene. If anything, it was certainly lovely to watch these stories flow so naturally. The genuine nature of which I spoke about can be clearly summarised by the huge grin you will undoubtedly have on your face after each story arc. \\n\\n\r\nThe only real problem I had with the story of clannad was that it felt very dismissive. Okazaki would get to know each new character individually, help and become emotionally entwined with them; then leave. It was as if Okazaki said to himself, \u2018Dang, dat bitch don\u2019t want the D, better scram\u2019. There were so many potential story arcs that could\u2019ve made the dismissed characters so much more fulfilled. Wasted potential. \\n\\n\r\nSound/ art- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs embody the charm of clannad. You can\u2019t help but smile when you see all the characters together. The animation itself was really successful. It was the artwork that made those extremely standard life issues so beautiful. At the same time, it was the animation that will crack you up in those comedic scenes. What ended up giving Clannad its powerful impact however was its stunning soundtrack. Piano and violin is always a great combination, mix that with a pinch of composed electronic sounds and a lot of emotion, and there you have the soundtrack of Clannad.  Here are some example; (have some tissues at the ready, you have been warned) \u2018Town, Flow of Time, People\u2019, \u2018Nagisa (theme)\u2019, and of course a song by Lia \u2018Ana\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSanae- \u2018So my\u2026 my bread is\u2026 meant to be bought at the listed price?!\\n\\n\r\nAkio- \u2018I LOVE YOUR BREAD!!\u2019\\n\\n\r\nIt goes without saying, Clannad is only as likeable as it is because of the great cast of characters. In the story, you have a set of constant characters that are always there. You also have the steadily increasing group of friends that Okazaki meets, where each new member will get individual attention in their story arc. What makes the characters really successful, is that there isn\u2019t a single person that can be defined by one trait. Sure they may be predominately cute, or mainly crazy, but there is always another angle to that character. You can understand each character on an emotional level, have fun with them with their everyday actions and define them as an individual. If anything, it was such a shame to see such amazing characters in such everyday circumstances. \\n\\n\r\nThe only complaint I have is what I mentioned earlier under the \u2018Story\u2019 section of my review; that there is definitely more that I wanted to see from each character, especially the cast of \u2018constant\u2019 characters who never got that individual attention. Fortunately, this issue was solved in Clannad After Story, so be sure to watch that immediately after Clannad.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (lovability)- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nClannad isn\u2019t something you enjoy; it is something you grow to love. Sure there are a bunch of hilarious moments, but they only serve to add to the individual appeal of the characters. Each of the story arcs are done in a way that is guaranteed to leave a smile on your face. Every character ends up being funny, sweet and just generally lovable. In the end, Clannad felt like an old friend with whom you shared many memories with but had to say goodbye to.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 8/10\\n\\n\r\n\u201cEmotions are what make us human. Make us real. The word 'emotion' stands for energy in motion. Be truthful about your emotions, and use your mind and emotions in your favour, not against yourself.\u201d\\n\r\nClannad is just a really lovely series to watch. No matter what genre you are in to, if you are human, I recommend you to watch Clannad, if anything, just so you can watch the masterpiece that is Clannad After Story. \\n",

            "content": "\"No matter how cold and distant people may become, on the inside something warm and precious always remains, something that never changes. To me, that\u2019s what family is like.\"\r\nThe quote above was, by far, one of the most powerful and moving quotes I've ever heard in an anime. It's an interesting fact to note that the word \"Clannad\" is actually the Irish Gaelic word for family. So, it is no understatement to say that intra-family relationships play a major role in this series.\r\n===Story (9/10) ===\r\nTo me, the story was unique and I felt it was a source of inspiration for the anime that came outin the very recent years. The story revolves around a certain \"delinquent\" who gets himself entangled in the lives of several girls of his age, where he helps them realize their dreams. To me, it was a story of self-discovery and building up self-confidence by creating and fostering relationships with those around him, something which seems unlikely for a person who was an introvert. \\n\r\nThe story in this season has a fair share of comical scenes and awkward situations but it is mainly emotion and recollection of past \u201cnightmares\u201d that grasp the viewer\u2019s attention.\\n\r\nI haven\u2019t read the visual novel and I feel certain events were left unexplained, most probably due to the number of episodes in the season, but still, those were minor aspects and did not have a noticeable effect on the story, as a whole.\\n\r\nThe story is anything but a smooth, straight road rather its a rough journey with many unexpected twists and turns.\\n\r\nSo, considering all factors, the story is quite entertaining and heartwarming and most of all, emotional. \\n\\n\r\n===Art (9/10) ===\\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation did a great job so that deserves a big thumbs up!\\n\r\nThe animation itself was quite fluid and the character designs were done well. (Personally, I like those characteristics anime features like those big eyes and \u2018moe\u2019 stuff).\\n\r\nThe symbolism within the art was exceptional so, overall, there\u2019s pretty much nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\n===Sound (8/10) ===\\n\r\nThe opening was really good, with lyrics that pretty much evoke emotion in anyone who listens to it.\\n\r\nThe ending, on the other hand, is something which most people would have mixed feelings about. \\n\r\nIt\u2019s a happy song, about a family of \u201cdango\u201d and it also highlights the fact that (once again) family is a key theme in this anime. But, at the same time, the ending might have affected the viewer\u2019s \u201cemotional balance\u201d after certain episodes ended since it is\u2026..well\u2026.too cute in a way.\\n\\n\r\nThe OSTs were phenomenal, they certainly did enhance and provide more colour (and emotion) to certain scenes so that\u2019s a massive plus point with the sound.\\n\\n\\n\r\n===Character (9/10) ===\\n\r\nI believe that this anime covered the entire spectra when it came to character personalities.\\n\r\nYou have the protagonist, Okazaki Tomoya with an introvert, carefree and at the same time lazy attitude and his partner-in-crime , Youhei Sunohara, a happy-go-lucky, comical individual.\\n\r\nThe most notable female characters include Nagisa Furukawa, who plays the lead role as the female protagonist, Kyou Fujibayashi, Sakagami Tomoyo and Ibuki Fuko.\\n\r\nNagisa\u2019s childish behavior, kind-heartedness and sweet temperament; Kyou\u2019s tomboyish, rowdy behavior and her \u201ctsundere-ness\u201d ; Tomoyo\u2019s stern, responsible attitude along with her caring nature ; Fuko\u2019s clumsiness and strong-will\u2026\u2026\u2026..All this combined with \u201cthe dirty duo\u201d is what makes this anime truly memorable and enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nWith regards to character development, it is true that some characters remained static throughout the series but then they never needed any improvements, now did they?\\n\r\nA drastic change in character is seen in both the male and female protagonists; both of them breaking out of the shackles which kept them restrained for so long.\\n\\n\r\nSince, it was a 23-episode season, you really get to know the characters fairly well and your emotions are evoked by them. \\n\\n\r\n===Overall (9/10) ===\\n\r\nThis anime is definitely worth the watch and lives upto its reputation as one of the most acclaimed romance animes and definitely leaves a lasting impact on its viewers.\\n\r\nThe iconoclastic story and characters make the story truly memorable and enjoyable and most probably leaves the majority in tears, at the end of it.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s indeed a true masterpiece.\\n",

(DON'T THINK THIS MEANS I THINK IT'S BAD - READ ON)\r\nThe reason why this is so? I liked the first season, i thought it was nice. The After Story, my god what a flawless piece of storyline craftsmanship. I can't watch it again cause i was swimming in my own tears in the after story even like 5 episodes past i was still crying...\r\nClannad will always have a spot in mytop anime because the characters and the storyline are just fantastic. If i may say one this, you don't really see much love between the two protagonists, i thought there was room for emphasis there, but thats just me being relatively picky. \\n\r\nSorry but, for all those out there, this is me saying, if you haven't watched this anime, DO SO. If you watched it and somehow didn't like it, go back and rewatch it 'til you do",

            "content": "Overall\t\r\nAt the time of writing this, I haven't watched \"After story\" yet, so this review is purely based on this season.\r\nFirst of all, let me say that this is one of the funnier animes I have seen. I love the main guy's ironic jokes and jargong.\r\n\"Clannad\" really hooked me from the beginning with its nice graphics and stunning intro. The first few episodes were great and I thought I had found a gem. Sadly, it kind of fell apart after a while. The story lost it focus.\r\nThing is, Clannad focuses more on the characters' backgrounds than their present and future. It's similar to AIR inthis regard, but this was not as well executerd.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\t\\n\r\nReally nice looking with digitally enhanced lighting effects, one of the better animated animes I have seen. And the intro is stunning.\\n\\n\r\nToo bad the character designs are not of the same high class. There is nothing wrong with them per se, but with such good graphic potential, I'd hoped for more.\\n\\n\r\nSound\t\\n\r\nIntro and outro are nice, but far from any top ten material. The voice acting is good, but nothing that really sticks out as excellent.\\n\\n\r\nStory\t\\n\r\nAs usual with these kinds of animes, there is a risk of a very episodic feel, with one girl falling for the main protagonist every episode. This is not the case here, luckily. There are many subplots running in parallell, and for the first half of the series, it is well directed and with a good flow. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, after a while the story loses momentum. It might have to do with that it starts off with probably the strongest substory, which ends in a really epic way, and all the plots after that feels bland and anticlimactic.\\n\\n\r\nI might complain more than I should here. I liked Clannad a lot, but it's just too freaking bad it couldn't keep the greatness up all the way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\t\\n\r\nThere are lots of likable characters (although there might be a bit too much focus on wierd personalities), and tons of background to dig up. Sadly, the backgrounds get a bit too much focus and get in the way of any forward development. I really hope \"After story\" fixes this.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: After watching After Story... yes. All is forgiven!",

            "content": "This is an anime that our local anime club introduced me to and I am very glad they did.  At first, I only watched to keep up with club when I was not on campus; although it didn't take very long to get hooked on watching Clannad.\r\nArt:\r\nThe art in Clannad is very well done.  Probably in the top 5 of anime I've watched.\r\nRating: 10\r\nSound:\r\nThe voice acting of the series was superb.  The music was well timed and complimented the mood of certain key scenes.\r\nRating: 10\r\nCharacter:\r\nOne word: Fuko.  Fuko's character alone was enough to keep me watching through the entire series.Clannad did a very good job of making the characters in the series likeable.  Sonohara's character development is worth noting as well.  He starts out as a complete comic relief character that always gets into trouble that later shows that he actually does care about others a lot more than you would think from first meeting him in the earlier episodes.  All in all, the character development was very well thought out and executed in a near perfect fashion.\\n\r\nRating: 10\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThere are three major story arcs that are ~completed in the first Clannad series: Fuko's initial arc which dealt with Fuko's condition and everything that revolved around Fuko's relationship with the school; Kotomi's arc which is for the most part comedic especially when it comes to violins also gets fairly emotional near the end of it and Nagami/Tomoya's arc develops all the way throughout the series along side the others and as a result of Fuko's first arc ending.  Clannad After Story starts where Clannad's last arc (Fuko's second arc) leaves off.  The three major arcs are well done and a few are tied closer together during Clannad After Story.\\n\r\nRating: 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nVery rarely has a series managed to pull off a combination of humor and very well done sad emotional moments like Clannad has managed to do.  I believe that on more than one occasion I've managed to nearly choke myself to death laughing at one thing or another from the series and honestly, this series was also the first I've seen that had a scene or two that made it hard not to cry.  The music did a wonderful job of amplifying the emotion of the scenes.\\n\r\nRating: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThis series is probably one of the best animes I have ever seen.  I would recommend the anime to pretty much anyone; especially those that still need to be brainwashed into the anime watching otaku community.  It is one of two anime series that I have not had to do any convincing to get my mother to watch.  That is a feat in of its self.\\n\r\nRating: 10",

Clannad will always be my first love! Thank you for reading :)",

The story is strong and is a roller coaster of mixed emotions. This anime will make you laugh trust me, there where times when I had to stop watching to catch my breath and at other times I felt like crying.\r\nI don't want to give any key points away or any spoilers so I wont. For the most part this is a extremely good anime and Irecommended you to watch this anime if you were wondering about it or eye balling it even if your not that into this kinda stuff. The music in this anime was amazing, the ending song \"Dongo\" is really good, and at times it well fits for emotional help during some scenes as well as the rest of the song list. All the Characters are lovable in their own way, Some being the typical love interest to the insanely talented characters to the amazingly over the top stupid best friend. Each character gets their own set of episodes with the main character. With each female character being a perfect match with the main character. I wont tell you who he chooses but I think its pretty obvious.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this Anime a little bit to much I think but in a good way. It well done and it was executed perfectly and makes you wonder whats going to happen next at every corner. Once you start your forced to watch the rest. When I started watching I had to watch all of them I couldn't stop and if I did, I was just wondering what was going to happen next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was great and MUST WATCH to all who love anime.\\n",

            "content": "First of all i'd like to say i loved this anime.\r\nIt was so heart warming. It had me crying and jumping for joy. This is one of those anime that you can easily and quickly get emotionally attached to. Which is sometimes a bad thing but in this case it was good. I enjoyed this anime very much. Of course watching this will get you to watch Clannad After story as well.\r\nStory: 10, the whole basis took me a while to understand but in the end it all came together with a nice ending explaining it all. I thought it was nice to wonder throughthe whole thing. Some may or may not like the ending its diffrent for everyone but i really like it and was overjoyed to the point of tears. The whole plot was layed out beautifully and went along smoothly.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9, the charecter design was not to much and not to little. I found it very nice. I think that it was nice to see and that they all looked very well designed. Easily some of the best art i've seen though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10, I enjoyed every song in this show especially the ED. Dango Daikazoku. It was used for happy and sad moments but it always seemed to make you cry. I strongly reccommend listing to the ED if you plan on watching this anime atleast one or twice. It will make the experince a whole lot better when it comes to sound in my opinion. Just so you know what the song is capable of. The OP was okay as well. One of my favorite songs played during some occasional moments as well like during the end of Fuu-chan's story. It acts as the OP for Clannad After Story in the Future. A beautiful song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10, each character was beautiful inside and out. They were all very individual and all had there flaws. The main characters are both very rich in traits and both make this show Clannad. They had there goods and unfortunatly there bads. Which is good, because sometimes anime characters are just all good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10, i very much enjoyed this. It was so rich in emotion and it was just a really good show. I can't say more. Thats really all there is to it. I was left speechless by the end.\\n\\n\r\nI STRONGLY reccommend this anime.",

In the second season for the first time in my life I cryed tears of joy and just before that I was probably crying the saddest tears ever. Now whenever i listen to the dango song I will cry btw it is justthat good. 10/10 must watch until the end both seasons for max effect.",

            "content": "*EVERYTHING IN THIS REVIEW IS MY OPINION*\r\nWhen I first heard about Clannad I wasn't sure what I thought about it it. Since I heard about it, I have read and heard multiple opinions on Clannad (and Clannad After Story which I unfortunately got spoiled for me before I even started the series), so I was not sure on how I was going to like it. Some people adored it and others not so much. \r\nSo I have sat here for a few months debating on whether or not I wanted to watch it. But may I just say I'm glad I did!\r\nClannad is given theguise of a completely typical and boring high school romance with undeveloped characters and cheesy scenes. However, it is not so. Clannad has some amazing characters with awesome development and story lines. Each character has around a 4-5 episode story arc that really gives you a chance to know that character which is something a lot of Shoujo anime I believe lacks. I especially enjoyed the story line for Katomi and cried when her arc ended! They do tend to kind of forget about the character after their story line has been shown, but I can get over that.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I loved about Clannad was the soundtrack. One of the main reasons I watch anime is because they have some of the best soundtracks ever! The opening made me very happy whenever I heard it and the ending was adorable. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to go on too much more otherwise this review will be 5 pages long! Basically what I'm trying to say is that Clannad was not at all what I was expecting and I really appreciated the supernatural twists and the dry sense of humor (mainly coming form Tomoya). I highly recommend this anime to anyone looking for a trip of feels.  \\n\\n",

The earlier episodes were a bore but did set a base for a part of the anime with random pop ins from someone in the earlier episodes to keep things a little different.\r\nI feel however that this anime could have been alot more meaningful and much better. The story is good, but that's just it. The pairing of the main story just didn't fit right. The alternate episodes were much more fitting and would have made a better storyline than the main story. Watching the alternate endings hit home and mademe feel the lows and the punch of romance while the main story line was mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just another anime, but thanks to the alternate episode/s, I won't forget this anime.\\n\r\nI hope the After Story is good.",

            "content": "Clannad is an anime that I really wanted to sit down and watch. Many people I know online and in real life said that this anime was the greatest thing they've ever seen. My short opinion is Clannad is definitely not a bad anime, it's enjoyable at times, but it has plenty of problems, and i'll address those later in the review. I apologize to the die hard fans, i'll try to be gentle\r\nStory 7/10-\r\nThe story to Clannad is pretty strait foreward. It basically consists of the main character, Tomoya Okazaki, who is surrounded by a harem of women of different character archetypes, these womenhave some sort of issue or tragic past to share and it's up to Tomoya to fix the issue. For the most part, this works, but unfortunately, it does have it's issues. I won't go into the issues caused by the characters themselves just yet, but I feel I need to address the pacing issue in the anime, and I understand that you can't have a plot twist every 2 episodes, but it feels like somewhere between the Fuko Ibuki and Kotomi Ichinose arcs, literally nothing happens. I will cut Clannad some slack, it does have Visual Novel origins and doesn't have a ton to work with. The show did have it's moments, but getting to them took forever. I enjoyed seeing Tomoya, a usual rebel without a cause, try to help these girls with their issues, and Nagisa, the main female lead, does a great job of opening up Tomoya to the world. Let me just warn anyone looking to watch this ahead of time, moe, moe, moe, moe, moe, moe, and did I say moe? If you don't enjoy moe or you have an extreme hatred of it, you will not have a good time with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nThe art needs to be praised, Clannad's animation is absolutely gorgeous, but that's to be expected from Kyoto. The only true error with the animation is actually not at the fault of Kyoto itself, but rather the original source material. Unfortunately, the thing you will be staring at the most, the characters, are my only complaint. All I can say is, THE EYES!!!!!!!! No joke, the characters eyes, mainly the female ones, are literally bigger than their hands! Although it makes them look cute, it's incredibly awkward to stare at, but you will get over it after awhile. Other than that, the animation is butter smooth and full of color.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nLuckily, none of Clannad's issues come from it's sound. The backtracks in Clannad are very fitting and never feel out of place, I particularly enjoy the track that plays during the girl and robot segments. The opening and ending themes are fantastic, the Dango family theme will be stuck in your head by the end. Overall, the music is great. The voice acting, dub in particular , could have been better, but overall, I made it through the entire series in dub so it couldn't have been that bad. I'd like to mention Greg Ayres as Sunohara and Christina Luci as Nagisa for their excellent work on this dub. That said, unless you're a die hard dub fan, you may want to stick with the sub.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10\\n\r\nEasily the biggest issue this anime has is it's characters. I know that the characters are from a visual novel, but it feels like some characters get the spotlight, while others are just thrown to the side for the time being. The 3 main characters that get the spotlight, are Fuko, Kotomi, and Tomoyo. The characters all seem to conveniently have tragic backstories that I will admit, do pull a few tears even from a guy like myself, but once you get the same formula of tragic backstory, then Tomoya comes to save the day, it ends up being rather generic. The characters are rather likable, however, and you do feel bad for them. For the sake of avoiding spoilers, I won't go into to much more detail, I want to address the forgotten characters though. For example, it feels like the Fujibayashi twins get no spotlight at all. They do get their special OVA episode, but as for actual canon, nothing. The characters are diverse enough to set them apart from each other, with the  exception of Ryou and Nagisa being rather similar, although it's the usual archetypes you have seen anywhere else. One last complaint, I feel that besides the fact that she is clearly the favored member of the harem, and her family seems to be the most involved, Nagisa never got her special time in the spotlight, kind of like the things she did were secondary to the actual story, i'll be it, she got some time at the end to tie up loose ends. The character Sunohara, is definitely my favorite character, he is up beat and always makes me laugh, even if it's right after a sad moment. Akio and Sanae Furukawa are also great characters, who in a way, become more like parents to Tomoya then his own father, but dear god, Sanae is a terrible bread baker. Overall, this is definitely Clannad's biggest short coming.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed watching Clannad, I definitely see why people hold it to such a high regard. Although it does have it's problems, it never became unwatchable, and I found myself growing attached to these characters by the end. The main thing keeping this category from getting any higher, is the painfully slow pace this show moves at. Otherwise this show kept me interested until the end, and I felt I got a satisfying ending, or rather, lead into the After Story. Not to mention, I was very happy to see Tomoya and Nagisa become an actual couple\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nJust to recap:\\n\\n\r\nLikes:\\n\r\n-The main characters and the relationship that grows between them\\n\r\n-Animation except characters\\n\r\n-All of the music\\n\r\n-Certain actors from the English Dub\\n\r\n-Sunohara\\n\\n\r\nDislikes:\\n\r\n-Painfully slow pace\\n\r\n-Fujibayashi twins had no time in the spotlight\\n\r\n-Nagisa didn't do a ton as a main character\\n\r\n-Plot convenient tragic backstories\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend it? \\n\r\nIf you're into moe drama love stories, or are just looking for something cute to watch that can make you cry one minute, than have you laughing the next, than I would recommend Clannad. If you're not, than you will probably dislike this anime a lot, as it's problems become more apparent when you don't have the cute, love story aspects to fall back on.",

            "content": "While Clannad: After Story is pretty universally acclaimed by anyone who was paying attention enough to understand the ending, the first season of Clannad has much more mixed reviews.  It will definitely be a hit or miss series for you depending largely on your sense of humor, patience, and overall enjoyment of slice-of-live comedies.  For me, it was a hit, and yes, that's right.  Clannad Season 1 is a COMEDY.  Don't go into it thinking you are going to get the most emotional show ever that you have been hearing about.  All of that happens in Season 2.  Withoutfurther ado, let me begin.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 7\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't really much of a main plot in the first season of Clannad.  Instead, we see multiple arcs that develop different characters and set up for After Story.  This is why you might get bored if you don't enjoy the slap-stick humor and sarcasm in this show.  Personally, I did, but if you don't, it might be a little bit tough for you to get through this season, but please try.  After Story is well worth it.\\n\r\nThis season does a good job at what it is supposed to do though.  The pacing is a bit slow, but it sets up perfectly for After Story and develops all of the characters very well.  I really enjoyed some of the characters' backstories, especially the main character, Tomoya's.  That one gets expanded much more on in After Story, though.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8\\n\\n\r\nClannad features the love-it-or-hate-it big-eyed girls.  It didn't phase me at all, but I know that some people have some very strong opinions on this type of art style.  Other than that, though, Clannad is very colorful which is definitely a plus for the humorous tone of the show.  The animation is good for what it needs to be, also.  It can adjust perfectly to suit the exaggerated slap-stick humor or the more sentimental scenes.  I liked it.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10\\n\\n\r\nYeah, Jun Maeda is a genius.  The music in Clannad might just be my favorite anime OST of all time.  There is a HUGE variety of tracks and almost every one of them is memorable.  I'm not going to list my favorites because there are just too many.  They sound great by themselves and fit the scenes they are played in very well.\\n\r\nThe opening theme song is pretty catchy and happy, but it's the ending song that's just plain awesome, not just because of the song itself but because of what it is in relation to the show.\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, the dub is not unwatchable if you don't get too attached to the original voices.  I thought it worked pretty well, but it wasn't superb like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Death Note, or anything like that.  The voices all fit their characters' personalities, but the execution could have been a little bit better.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8\\n\\n\r\nClannad Season 1 is much more character orientated than plot driven, and it does this pretty well.  Some of the characters seem a little stereotypical at first, but not too may stay that way.  Some characters are a bit useless, but the ones that are not are developed very well.\\n\r\nI would also like to add that I LOVE the relationship between the two main male characters, probably because I can relate to it so much.  The main character is a sarcastic, cynical prankster, and his \"best friend\", Sunohara, is a little bit oblivious to it at times.  He gets fooled or lured into a situation where he will tick someone off (usually due to his own stupidity more that Tomoya's intervention) and get his butt kicked in my favorite kind of animated slap-stick humor.  There are not too many scenes like this, so they don't get old, but there are enough to keep things interesting... IF you like that kind of humor; a mix of sarcasm and slap-stick.  Every single joke played on Sunohara by Tomoya was hilarious to me, but it may or may not be for you.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Clannad immensely simply because of how funny I thought it was.  I never got bored and didn't care that I would have to wait so long to get to the tear-jerking second season.  This is just me, though, so maybe Clannad will not be your thing.  You'll just have to give it a try to see if you like it.  I sincerely hope you do, because After Story is something everyone should see, and I don't want you missing out on it just because you couldn't make it through this first season.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8\\n\\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that Clannad can't be for everybody, because After Story is truly amazing, but you can't justifiably watch that season without watching this one first.  All the impact would be lost.  Even though I thought Clannad was hilarious, if you don't, some of the more stereotypical characters and lack of a central plot might stick out more to you.  Overall, if you like a comedy spice-of-life, this show might be your new favorite.  If you like more romance and drama, After Story is for you, but you should watch this season first.  If you don't like anything even CLOSE to those genres, I would just avoid Clannad as a whole.",

            "content": "Clannad is a special case.  It manages to combine two seemingly incompatible genres, shoujo and harem. As for its tone, it mostly tries to get you sad, occasionally having some fun moments in-between. How much you are going to enjoy this anime depends hugely on how much the sad parts can actually touch you and how much the funny parts can actually entertain you. And because the enjoyment you can derive from this anime depends so much on your self instead of factors that can appeal widely, you should be a bit close-minded about what you read in this review. After all, they maynot matter to you.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to actual content, Clannad is lacking. It tries so hard to make you sad that it feels completely arbitrary. Every character has some sort of very sad backstory which comes back to bite them and make everything gloomy. Thankfully, the power of friendship is there to save the day. The humor is handled a bit better, though not by much. The main problem here is that the majority of Clannad's humor relies on a single character acting like a moron and being the butt monkey of every joke. This stopped being funny after about one episode, yet its intensity doesn't drop throughout the series. At least the rest of the humor was generally funny.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, Clannad has one major problem. The eyes of the female characters (reminder: female to male ratio is like 5 to 1 in this anime) are way too big. So big that it will likely still annoy you after you get used to it. But other than that, Clannad looks well. The male characters look good, the locations look good, the animation is good. Visual effects go a bit overboard at times, though.\\n\\n\r\nClannad is generally nice on the ears. The voice actors did a good job and the music generally fits. There are however, two major problems. First, those \"cutesy\" extremely high-pitched voices belonging to small girls are annoying. Second, the \"sad\" music bits tend to be failures. Other than those issues, the sound can pull its own weight.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, overall, I'd say Clannad was rather boring. Under normal circumstances, I would have probably dropped it somewhere before the halfway mark. However, I kept going because of the sequel, which is supposed to be one of the best anime in existence. Let's just hope that it can live up to my expections at least partially, because it if turns out to be just more of the same, I'm going to be pretty fucking pissed.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, if you are a sucker for sad stuff, you are probably going to like Clannad. If not, it's a risk. If you are feeling unsure, you should watch a few episodes and see if it gets you interested.\\n",

            "content": "A long time ago, I found a bottle floating in the ocean off the coast of Santa Monica. It contained a lengthy research paper, allegedly belonging to a renowned pair of married scientists who had disappeared at sea years prior. I never told anyone about this paper... I mean, after I read it, how could I? It spoke of concepts that frightened me, and the idea of handing it over to anyone in authority chilled me to the bone. I could never hand this thesis over to my own government, because I just knew someone would try to use the information contained within to developweapons that could destroy the very fabric of existence as we knew it. See, this thesis spoke of alternate timelines... I know, big shock right? The multiverse has been existing in the minds of scientists for years now, but here\u2019s the thing Never has the method for accessing those timelines been so perfectly realized.\\n\\n\r\nThe paper spoke of a unique world where everything... And I mean everything, from the movement of the stars to the fate and decisions of every individual human... Revolved around the whims of one perfect teenage boy, who thankfully was too apathetic to harness his true powers, with which he could easily mobilize an army of obsessive, sexually-frustrated moe girls. Out of all the millions of alternate versions of this universe, there were some where people believed his plight to be pinnacle of emotional depth and perfection in story-telling... And in other realities, people claimed that his story was sick, pathetic wish fulfillment and tragedy porn. And that, in heavily simplified terms, is how you access these multiple realities... You create a universe so divisive that every single person who experiences it has a radically different experience with it, and accept that every single one of those opinions is somehow correct.\\n\\n\r\nThat world is called Clannad, and it is beautiful. I mean aesthetically, and in terms of animation? This show is gorgeous. Unsurprisingly, it was produced by Kyoto Animation, the patron saints of good looking anime, and as you may have expected from my only other Kyoto Animation review (Free), Clannad obviously had a lot of love and money poured into it A wide range of motion and visual effects is used throughout the series, effortlessly switching between the mundane shots of people walking and talking together, to the fast paced actions shots of over-the-top fights breaking out on campus, to beautiful CGI that gets used sparingly and never looks out of place, and at no point is it ever apparent that the producers had to bother saving a single penny.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that turns out to have been a very good choice, because this series is based on a KEY visual novel, which means it carries with it a very distinct sort of design. I\u2019ve seen the term \u201cMoe-blob\u201d used to describe this design, where male characters have reasonably realistic facial proportions but their female counterparts have giant, tumorous doe-eyed countenances, and it certainly applies here, as this is the kind of show that would look like walking garbage if it weren\u2019t produced with the budget of a small country. PA Works might have been a better fit, but comparison aside, Kyoto Animation knew exactly what they were doing with this title. Big eyes can easily look like dead eyes, but Kyo-Ani took full advantage of those giant peepers in order to channel an entire spectrum of emotions that breathe full, vibrant life into what would otherwise be unrealistic and unrelatable visual novel tropes.\\n\\n\r\nLike the animation, the music is diverse, had a lot of love and attention put into it, and can cover a wide variety of moods, and it works... Most of the time? Okay, positives first, emotional highlights are very well tended to, and the music that plays during those \u2018other world\u2019 segments is hauntingly appropriate. The Insert song \u201cDango Daikazoku\u201d appears very prominently as an in-universe song that the cast is aware of, as well as the ending theme for the series. Where the soundtrack unfortunately falters is in it\u2019s quieter, more mundane moments, where characters are just standing around talking. The music playing in support of these moments could best be described as generic, as it sounds like plenty of these tracks were ripped directly from the backgrounds in the game and played on loop. Honestly, there are times throughout the series where those tracks just wind up coming off as annoying, overpowering the dialogue rather than supplementing it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as for the dub... Oh boy. We\u2019re about to enter sticky territory with this one. Granted I\u2019ve been in this territory before, but not under these circumstances, so bear with me. In fall of 2014, veteran ADR director Steven Foster quit his job with Sentai filmworks. In a very revealing interview, he later trashed many of the shows he had worked on, relating the intense fan hatred of his work to the fact that the work itself was unsalvageable. One of these shows was Clannad, which he didn\u2019t understand and found entirely unrelatable, so he basically just covered his ass by casting people he knew he could trust to handle the roles. Ever since release, Clannad has been considered one of the worst english dubs of all time, the quintessential example of Mr. Foster\u2019s dubious talents, and... I don\u2019t really get why.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, let me start off by saying I don\u2019t think this dub is very good. There are tons of little hiccups in the dialogue, such as awkwardly worded lines like \u201cHe\u2019s that retired charismatic musician\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t know where the taking seriously even begins with you,\u201d that would honestly sound right at home coming out of the mouths of Johnny and his best friend Mark, but in my opinion, Foster\u2019s instincts were more or less spot-on when it came to casting this show. David Matranga is one of my favorite voice actors of all time, and while he\u2019s limited to deep voiced characters, he can utilize a lot of humor and drama within that limit, which made him the perfect choice for the main character, a 17 year old delinquent with a troubled home life and a penchant for pulling pranks. Luci Christian turned up the kawaii-ness to play his gentle and sensitive love interest, and Greg Ayres was on fire in his typecast role as Sunohara, even if I\u2019ll admit his character was changed from interesting to insufferable in the rewrites.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned in my Angel Beats review that Emily Neves was a bit on the mediocre side, and that her co-stars were way out of her league. Was that too mean of me? Well, I hope this redeems me... Following Angel Beats, she got really good, really fast. She\u2019s turned into a very subtle and natural sounding actor, which helped to save the otherwise questionable character of Kotomi, and of course, Hilary Haag was a natural choice to play the dippy Fuko. My only serious complaint is with the two twins Ryou and Kyou, and I\u2019m sorry, but as good as Shelley Callene-Black can be when handled properly, she sounds like a forty year old, and has no business playing a teenager... Even a gruff one. Brittany Karbowski plays her more diminutive sister to a somewhat better degree, but it kills me to hear such a multitalented actor get stuffed into such a one note role. I kind of wish they\u2019d cast her as both sisters, using different tones and speech patterns for each. But aside from that, I have no idea why the dub is so reviled, because it\u2019s nowhere near as bad as Angel Beats was, and I see no problem in recommending both languages.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Steven Foster\u2019s other complaints? Well, I\u2019m personally of the opinion that an ADR director shouldn\u2019t call a project unsalvageable, even if it\u2019s a terrible show in general. Master of Martial Hearts has to be one of the worst anythings I\u2019ve ever seen, but damn it if Funimation didn\u2019t put all of their effort into dubbing that turkey. No anime is bad enough that dubbing it is a waste of time, and if you think it is, you should probably hand the responsibilities to somebody else, rather than slogging through a project you don\u2019t want to do. Having said that, I will very begrudgingly admit that his comments about this particular series aren\u2019t entirely unfounded.\\n\\n\r\nWe\u2019ll start with the obvious one; He claims Clannad is difficult to understand. This is sadly true for a lot of people, and I\u2019ll freely confess that I was taking the supernatural elements of the series with a grain of salt until somebody sat down and explained them to me. In addition to the main story, which is somewhat confusing in it\u2019s own right, there are two plot lines that can leave viewers scratching their heads. The first is the multiple universes, an idea that gets brought up in seemingly random fashion until you smack your head for overthinking it and write it off as an excuse to have different paths from the game adapted into OVA episodes. At least it makes more sense here than when Umineko tried to explain it. The other is a strange, haunting subplot about a lonely little girl building herself a sentient robot friend and bouncing existential questions off of him. There\u2019s also magic tying emotions to the town, and once I had it explained to me it DID make some of the more questionable occurrences seem clearer, but you\u2019d have to be paying extra close attention during the sequel series to pick up on any of that for yourself, and none of it really adds any depth to the story, they just explain things a bit. I\u2019d go as far as to say there\u2019s no shame in just taking the supernatural material with a grain of salt.\\n\\n\r\nSo what about his other complaint, that he couldn\u2019t relate to the characters? Well, that\u2019s like saying Peter Griffin would make a bad party guest. There is nothing realistic or believable about literally any of the characters in this show, the things they do, the things they say, or the way they relate to each other, and this can all be connected back to the fact that it was based on a visual novel. A visual novel, for people who don\u2019t know, is a text-heavy dating game where you pick the romantic option you like the most out of a handful of options, and perform tasks to raise their affection levels so you can pork them. Turning this format into a series is not an easy thing to do, I admit, but that doesn't excuse any show from sucking at it.\\n\\n\r\nRemember how in Toradora, the main character started off without a single girl interested in him, and he eventually wormed his way into the hearts of three girls as they got to know him and understand his value? Well, out of Tomoya Okazaki\u2019s options, there are two girls who already love him right from the get go, one who loves him but is in denial, and two who don\u2019t immediately love him but instantly trust and get along with him. To be fair, the writers took the extra effort to give him a personality, but that doesn\u2019t make up for him and Nagisa\u2019s parents being the only characters with any emotional depth. Sunohara\u2019s entire purpose is to act like an obnoxious pervert just to make Tomoya seem more cool as a result(and he gets worse in season 2), and the female characters run the gamut from infantile pansies to obsessed harpies whose every goal in life revolves somehow around either winning Tomoya or giving him tasks to complete to win them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s basically how the plot of this anime unfolds... On the path to completing the main quest, for the main girl, Tomoya has to complete various tasks to satisfy the other minor arcs, for the other girls. Each accomplishment unlocks a new girl\u2019s challenge, which frustrates me to no end. According to Clannad, you can\u2019t form or strengthen a relationship with somebody without doing elaborate chores for them. In order to get somebody to come out of their room, you have to weed their yard and plant a new flower garden for them. If you want to get someone elected student council president, you have to take them around and have them participate in a bunch of athletic club activities, which they couldn\u2019t possibly do themselves. You can\u2019t confess your feelings to a girl who\u2019s obviously showed signs of liking you since episode 3 until you take her by the hand and practically drag her through all the processes of starting and maintaining the club she kinda sorta wanted to join, and no, i\u2019m not making any of that up.\\n\\n\r\nEssentially, Clannad... This oh so romantic classic... Paints dating in such a way that perpetuates the classic toxic attitude of entitlement. You don\u2019t have to worry about physical attraction, mutual respect, chemistry, or any of that complicated stuff... If you paid fifty dollars for dinner and she didn\u2019t put out, something must be broken in the game. From date rape to people simply getting pissed that you didn\u2019t thank them for saying God Bless You, entitlement is an ugly thing, especially when you force yourself upon peoples\u2019 lives in ways they don\u2019t want or need. As Parker J. Palmer put in a recent column called The Gift of Presence, The Perils of Advice, \u201cThe human soul doesn\u2019t want to be advised or fixed or saved. It simply wants to be witnessed \u2014 to be seen, heard and companioned exactly as it is. When we make that kind of deep bow to the soul of a suffering person, our respect reinforces the soul\u2019s healing resources, the only resources that can help the sufferer make it through.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSo, why does Tomoya feel the need to meddle in every single thing? Why can\u2019t he just connect with people on an interpersonal level? Because you\u2019re supposed to be able to insert yourself into this character, and if you\u2019re the target audience for visual novels... Lonely Japanese men who can\u2019t get laid because women refuse to marry early out of fear that the legal bondage of marriage will destroy their hopes of having a career... Are presented with simple binary choices from women who are already openly accepting of the idea of polishing his knob, and will happily reward him for making all of their clearly and explicitly established dreams come true. I\u2019d just like to point out that I was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome at age 4. I\u2019m legitimately socially retarded, and this shit even sounds pathetic to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I started this review off with a sarcastic plot synopsis is because I just didn\u2019t know how to describe the plot accurately without jumping right into some of my negative comments. There\u2019s a lot of stuff that happens throughout the series, but since I\u2019m only reviewing the first season in this post, the usable plot boils down to who Tomoya is going to pick, which is a very hard climax to relate to any of the melodrama that set it up, especially since the reward it was driving towards was something that could have been taken care of within a six episode ova. God forbid the series starred normal people, or the important love connection could have been made THAT early, cutting off the most obvious will-they-wont-they scenario since Love Hina right off at the pass.\\n\\n\r\nSo now that I\u2019ve gotten all of that off my chest, was there anything redeeming about this series? Yes, and quite a bit. Out of all the story arcs, with Tomoya leading hapless child-like girls around by the wrist while they thirst for his dick, there\u2019s one arc featuring a much more believable child who DOESN\u2019T have a wide-on for him. That girl is Fuko, and if you\u2019re able to ignore the egregiously unfunny Suzohara/Tomoyo skits that happen throughout, it\u2019s by far the most compelling arc of this season. What she wants, where she\u2019s coming from and what she has to go through is damn near tear-jerking, and it feeds into the main plot way more than the others. And aside from that, there are a lot of jokes that are objectively funny, and none of them involve the comic relief character, Sunohara. Hell, Tomoya\u2019s practical jokes are the funniest content available, and his joke on Sunohara just happens to be the one that drags on for too long. Unfortunately, a handful of good jokes don\u2019t make up for a truckload of bad ones, so take what you can get, I guess?\\n\\n\r\nClannad is available from Sentai Filmworks. It can be purchased in affordable quarters if you\u2019re not interested in the dub, but if you are, good luck, because after over five years, the sixty dollar price tag has only dropped to about 40 dollars as an occasional sale price. The set comes packaged with a special OVA episode replacing the main girl with one of the side girls, and it exists. A second season called After Story is also available, and while pricing is virtually the same, I\u2019ll be reviewing that very soon. A film is also available stateside, but true to Key\u2019s roots, it\u2019s only a cash-grab retelling of the series. There are tons of manga and game entries that are available in Japan, but as far as I\u2019m aware(correct me if I\u2019m wrong) none of them have been released stateside, as visual novels are not as familiar a thing to westerners as they are to Japan.\\n\\n\r\nHave you ever wondered why this anime is called Clannad, and what connection(if any) it has to the Irish band of the same name? Well, there\u2019s a funny story behind that. Jun Maeda picked it because he mistakenly believed it was the gaelic word for family. It\u2019s not, of course, it\u2019s actually a portmanteau of two different words essentially referring to an old Gaelic clan. Not only does this story never fail to impress other nerds at parties, but it also illustrates what sets Clannad apart from the other visual novel shows of it\u2019s ilk... The fact that it is so ungodly pretentious. It\u2019s so easy to laugh at the \u2018deeper\u2019 subplots as soon as you hear the phrase \u201cThe magic orbs are just dragon balls.\u201d I don\u2019t agree with the people who claim that it\u2019s the worst anime of all time, and I\u2019d rather not have any physical contact with people who call it one of the best anime of all time, but I guess I can understand where both parties are coming from. Me, I think there\u2019s merit to this series, and that it\u2019s worth seeing based on it\u2019s technical prowess and the obvious amount of ambition that went into it, but over-all, it\u2019s this kind of emotionally manipulative, cliche-ridden, socially out-of-touch series that the word \u2018overrated\u2019 was invented for. I give Clannad a 3/10.",

At the time I began viewing the series, I had not heard of the visual novel, I only had a recommendation from a friend to watch the series. After watching the first thirty seconds, I immediately became hooked on the series. Unlike most high-school romance series, CLANNAD focuses more on drama as opposed to comedy, and although many light-hearted moments appear throughout the anime, the main focus is on the drama.\r\nKyoto animation have pulled off yet another spectacular anime, with high quality animation. The amount of effort put into the production does justice the thebeautiful story of CLANNAD. The superb animation, combined with a brilliant soundtrack and a excellent story, make for an overwhelmingly great anime experience. For those who haven't watched CLANNAD before, and enjoy the romance genre or 'high-school life', I definitely recommend this series.",

            "content": "Okay I've seen this anime being rated very highly, and I just want to set the record straight. This is not taking After Story into consideration, this is purely the original Clannad.\r\nStory: The story follows Tomoya Okazaki, a high school student who meets a girl named Nagisa Furakawa at the bottom of a hill. It turns out she is repeating the school year, due to her illness, and so she no longer has any friends. Her goal is to restart the school's drama club and act out a play for the school. Tomoya with nothing better to do decides to help.\r\nWhich is all well andgood but half the time they're spent helping people with their trivial, boring problems. Two arcs in particular stand out as being nothing but major league stalling, that do nothing to advance the overall story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Very good throughout, however one slight issue, is when characters are crying they look retarded.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Decent but there are about four renditions of the same track. The opening theme is garbage, but the ending theme is good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is the high point, all of the characters are very good, and there are a wide variety of them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Decent but definitely do not believe the hype. This is however, necessary viewing if you wish to watch Clannad: After Story, which is far superior.",

            "content": "Clannad is brought to us by Kyoto Animation, the same people who gave us Lucky Star and Air, so you already know you're in a safe place with those facts. It tells the story of Nagisa and Tomoya throughout their high school life. Occasionally, other characters have sub plot stories, but they aren't the center of Clannad.\r\nPROS\r\nClannad is all about characters. It is the essential building blocks of this anime and the reason for all of the love it has received over the years. All characters in this anime, and I mean all of them, are layered out and interesting. No one is left asa side-character in the way same that other shows do. This anime focuses on every character and gives good background to who they are and why they do such things. \\n\\n\r\nThe story to Clannad is nothing special on the surface, but the underlying themes are spread throughout. Family, friendship, happiness, and everything that makes up the world we live in is discussed in great detail. Other anime with similar plots usually miss these themes when telling the story to their characters, which is why Clannad is so special. It deals with everything and more. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack to Clannad is brilliant on every single level. The opening gets you pumped for a slice-of-life anime that goes beyond what many others stories can do. Actually, I think the soundtrack is perfect. There isn't one song in this anime that is not great, which is pretty amazing. \\n\\n\r\nCONS\\n\\n\r\nCertain episodes, especially in the beginning, can be very slow at times. It isn't an anime that goes by quickly (which can be considered good or bad). I, for one, was quite annoyed with this in the first couple of episodes. It annoyed me so much that I took time off from watching the other episodes because of how bored I was with the first few. Luckily, this changed my second time around. I still thought the same episodes were boring, but they weren't nearly as bad as when I first saw Clannad. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nI know many might be turned away by the cliche storyline of Clannad, but I really have to say that it is a life-changer. One simply has to watch this, even if they don't like anime, in order to get a better understanding of life itself. Please do not let the slow-paced episodes keep you from seeing this anime. It has to be seen. It is a must-see.",

            "content": "Among the many already written reviews for this show, I shall add another opinion, slightly less interesting in comparison to the others, but hopefully useful. \r\nSome context: I loved anime when I was younger, and didn't watch it for the last ten or so years. Clannad got me back in.\r\nComing back into Anime with Clannad was a great way to start. The show moves really fast visually - meaning, we don't spend much time in any one place with the characters. They are always moving, walking around, helping each other out, etc. This really helped solidify an idea of active environment for the characters, whichfor me, kept me continually watching. The show isn't one where you can stand up and leave for a little bit and come back knowing what's going on. You should pay attention. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I think you'd want to. The characters are so well written, and I particularly enjoyed the main characters realistic/skeptical perspective on life. This made a wonderful clash against the over exaggerated dialogue, mindsets, and actions the surrounding characters had. This equation made for a nice blend of practical realism and typical anime humor. It was very well done.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want some thing down to earth, easy to relate to, this show is it. It isn't shy to be goofy, and isn't cowardly to be serious. There were times when I really had to sit back and just absorb the big life concepts this show presented, and it really pulled the heart strings. \\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't seen it, give it a go as soon as you can. The follow up is Clannad: After Story.\\n\\n\r\nYou can buy them, on Amazon (which is what I did. You spend a little, but I gotta say it was well worth the price.)",

            "content": "The third Key / Visual Art's animated project from Kyoto Animation, Clannad mostly discards the magical aspects of Kanon and Air for a more down to Earth story about a boy, a girl, and the numerous people they encounter in both school and outside of it.\r\nAt the same time, it's also about family, as every character's arc in this series revolves around their family members in some form (and even some of the side characters do as well). Whereas Air and Kanon felt like separate stories with a theme that loosely tied the cast together, Clannad has no such disjointed feeling, and is part ofthe reason that I think this is (arguably) the best written of the three Key animated adaptions by Kyoto Animation to date.\\n\\n\r\nEven the main heroine is more fleshed out than the typical Key heroine. Though Nagisa is more than just a little bit clingy, shy, and introverted, she's generally a likable heroine who actually looks and acts like a girl her age would. (Which means she doesn't end her sentences with cutesy suffixes like \"gao\" or \"ugu\".) Mai Nakahara does a good job of making her sound cute without being cutesy, and it makes the rare scene where Nagisa shows a slightly more mischievous side to her character that much more amusing. Tomoya is also a nice change of pace among the typical dime-a-dozen male leads these days: nice yet not afraid to raise his voice, funny without being mean-spirited about it, an outcast and yet not unapproachable. Almost any scene involving the duo together is a winner, and Nagisa's wonderfully amusing parents only help in that respect.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also Youhei Sunohara, a once delinquent friend of Tomoya's whose big mouth often gets him into various situations, especially with that of another girl in the school: Tomoyo. An old friend of Tomoya's, Tomoyo is one year younger than him and has a reputation as being a violent girl (early in the series she beats up some boys from a local school). There's a running gag in the series of Sunohara claiming that Tomoyo is not a girl, only to have him get beaten up in turn when he \"challenges\" her. This results in a fighting game-esque combo counter appearing at the bottom of the screen as she beats him up, which actually adds up over time during the course of the series. Despite her sometimes secluded nature, Tomoyo is probably the most normal, down to Earth girl in the entire series and Veteran actress Houko Kuwashima (Miyako, Bamboo Blade) does a great job in that regard. She even got her own spin-off game and OAV after the release of the game and anime respectively, the only Key side character to date to obtain that honor.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the two side girls and their arcs: it's such a crying shame that the supporting cast of this series is not as strong as Tomoya and Nagisa. In typical Key / Visual Art's fashion, we have a gaggle of girls running around the plot in and out of this series, and after episode 4 the series drops the concentration on the main cast and spends half the series developing two characters: Fuko, a short girl who loves starfish and whose sister is getting married soon, and Kotomi, a shy bookworm who spends most of her days in the library reading books barefoot. While not bad characters, the way the series goes through their arcs only distracts from the main couple, who are regulated to helpers throughout both arcs. Whereas Kanon spiced things up with supernatural themes and Air came and went through its small cast's arcs pretty swiftly to not overstay its welcome, Clannad does not have those luxuries.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, much like in Kanon, Clannad puts characters in front of you and then reveals to you their pasts and background later. This holds true especially for Fuko, whose one-note personality of her lobe of starfish wears thin after a couple of episodes, much less the 6 episode arc she has. (Her subsequent appearances after the end of her arc, in which she makes cameos during the middle of conversations to proclaim her love of starfish yet again, do little but distract from the scene she's in.) To quote another person from a forum I go on: \"It's like backwards character development\". I'm all for unique storytelling in animation as the next guy, but shifting focus from the main characters to focus on another character's story for several episodes on end is kind of annoying to those who want to learn more about the main characters. It wasn't a big deal in Kanon because the side characters were often just as interesting as the main cast, but such is not the cast here. Poor Nagisa spends nearly half of the series tagging alongside other characters, kind of like Mickey Mouse did in the Mickey, Donald, and Goofy cartoons made in the 1930's. Considering that Nagisa has top billing over the other girls in this series, that's a little annoying.\\n\\n\r\nStill, though, even in the series' weakest moments there are some cute scenes here and there to pick up the pace of the show. And although they drag from time to time, the two girls' arcs are still more fleshed out than they ever were in Air, and are handled in a realistic fashion as well. It's really the little touches here and there that made this series for me, such as Tomoya and Nagisa throwing Fuko a party for her sister's marriage, Kotomi's struggle to play the violin, Nagisa's attempt to bring members to the Drama Club with pictures of cute little dangos based on a show from her youth, that make it all worth it. And much like in the last Key series, there are surprise twists here and there that you won't see coming until they happen.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Kotomi's arc ends, the story focuses back again on Tomoya and Nagisa's relationship, as well as that of twin female classmates from Tomoya's class: Kyou Fujibayashi, a rough-spoken friend of Tomoya's, and her sister Ryou, a shy girl who can (inaccurately) predict people's fortunes. Kyou's the obligatory flustered, violent girl, while Ryou's shyness is milked at times for all it's worth (including a funny scene where she is used to confuse Fuko into thinking Tomoya turned into a girl, swapping places with him to do so).\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are plenty of cute moments in this series, Clannad is not without its dramatic parts. The revelation of Fuko and who she is, Kotomi's not so pleasant childhood, Kyou and Ryou's struggling feelings for a certain someone, Tomoya's fighting with his father, and even Nagisa's struggle to re-start the drama club are handled in a somewhat serious manner (even if the series takes it quite a bit too far in times). These are nicely balanced out among the more humorous moments, such as the numerous RPG parodies, Nagisa's parents' \"fighting\", Kotomi's inability to play the violin, and the Fuko cameos in the second half of the series (one episode has her showing off her \"crane game\" skills, when she has actually none).\\n\\n\r\nAnd now for the visual aspects of the series. It's much like that of Air and the Kanon remake: beautiful scenery amongst not so beautiful characters. A little nicer than in Kanon, Clannad's character designs take some time getting used to (the eyes in particular). The music, taken directly from the game, has a few nice themes here and there, but they're recycled endlessly and heavily synthesized (though the ending theme is cute, though also sad). The voice acting's solid and includes big names like Mai Nakahara as Nagisa, Noto Mamiko as Kotomi, Kikuko Inoue as Nagia's mother, Ryou Hirohashi as Kyou and, one of my series favorites, Daisuke Sakaguchi (Shinpachi, Gintama) as Sunohara.\\n\\n\r\nI'll admit that Clannad is not without its slow parts or eye-rolling moments. Heck, I stopped watching the series for six months out of complete disinterest, and I still have yet to see an episode of the sequel series After Story. At the same time, though, I can't remember the last visual novel anime adaption that left me with remembering so much of its cast and their quirks, as opposed to wondering how cute its flavor-of-the-month heroine is. (I'm looking at you, Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka!) I really do like Tomoya and Nagisa as a couple, and the series' cute, charming aspects more than make up for its shortcomings. It's the most fleshed-out and real Key animated adaption to date, and if you even sort of liked Kyoto Animation's last two Key animated adaptions, you'll definitely enjoy this one as well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI apologize if there are shortcomings or mistakes, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Thank you.",

It's set at a school and the story is mostly just Tomoya's life and how he basically helps everyone he comes in contact with. It's also a romance though at first that isn't evident and I still have yet to see anyone kiss. It is a harem so all the girls in the school love Tomoya (who wouldn't?) Clannad has a story that will leave smiling like a fool one second and crying the next, it's a veryheartwarming and sad anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great all the characters are very well drawn and very cute. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is good the songs are very emotional and add to the anime a lot. Especially the Big Dango Family song which plays at the end of each episode and for some reason makes me want to cry despite it being so cute and silly. The only problem with the sound is that if you watch the English dub version you'll notice that a couple voices are kinda high pitched and Ryou's voice is very soft and kinda bugs me. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the strongest point of this anime. They are all super likeable and have wonderful back stories. Tomoya is a wonderful protagonist and Nagisa is very sweet as well. Sunohara and Nagisa's parents are hilarious but even they have their dramatic parts that will leave you crying. Clannad has a big cast but each character is vital and likeable.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a ton and I am enjoying the sequel just as much. This anime is a must watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the best anime I've ever seen. It's a must watch! It's beautiful and nearly perfect, it's basically just amazing.",

An other good element is that the background explanation of a girl can sometimes be many episodes apart from the introduction of that girl which gives you the time to first \"get to know her\" so you can fully sympathise with her.\r\nThe dialogue can be really good and funny but the comedy parts are too far apart for my taste.\r\nNothing special was done with the animation which is good because it would only ruin it.\r\nEven though it wasn't humorous enough to bemy kind of series, I still enjoyed it.",

            "content": "(Spoilerless Review)\r\nas a reviewer i have chosen not to review Clannad alone, but together with Clannad: AS as i believe that you can't really judge the two without having watched the other one.\r\n- The Review -\r\nso exactly what makes Clannad such a masterpiece? I don't really know myself, but i sure do know that it just is. It has Slice of Life written all over it and is indeed nicely done intro to a far superior romantic S2. For comedy, it has its moments, and those moments surely are hilarious, yet it still sticks to its everyday life of a high-school student theme(later everyday lifeof a normal guy). If you decide to watch Clannad, be prepared for anything, don't spoil it for yourself by reading the spoilers of season 2, it will just ruin it for you, however you must watch season 2 in order to receive the true feeling of Clannad, as that is were the climaxes will be and were the feely feels will be present. Clannad S1 is simply the introduction and the follow-up to S2.\\n\r\n- Ratings -\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nThe story of Clannad is simple, yet a little complicated. I won't spoil anything, so i will just leave it at that. At very few times you will be left a little clueless of what was actually going on (the robot and girl part). Yet you will understand or interpret it your own way with time. Which is another reason why the story is so great. Despite the very few flaws, of which you might not even notice, the story is truly great and original yet unique in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nat the beginning i was a little skeptical of the art of Clannad, yet with time i came to accept that it simply could'nt have been illustrated in any better way than it already was. The eyes of the characters are very unique, which they also are with other Key productions. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe music of Clannad S1 and S2 is simply breathtaking. I still occasionally listen to the OST as it simply is beatiful. The Dango song at the end of S1 is silly at start but a true tearjerker once you have seen both S1 and S2. I also song along with the characters at various times in the anime. However the ending song of S2 was kind of out of context, and should be different.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThe characters is one of the things that really gives this show spirit and soul. It is the characters that will make me rewatch this anime someday, as i simply am too attached to them. They will live on in my heart forever. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nClannad was something i wasn't prepared for. It touched me in ways nothing else has done before. I have never cried so much in my life before over something so small as an anime. I usually don't cry over tv shows or fictional stories, neither do i cry when i see disasters on the news. But Clannad was different, i was a wreck. Clannad took me somewhere inside myself i thought not existed. And i enjoyed it, i experienced something new, which seems to be rarer and rarer in life. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI laughed, i cried, i felt feelings i did not know i could feel. And therefore it gets the most well deserved 10 i have ever given in my entire life and probably never will give again.\\n\\n\r\nReview by MrCallaghan\\n\r\n02-08-2012 (no. 01)",

            "content": "After watching the whole series, it just seems to me that the only reason to watch Clannad is to set up After Story. My review will reference After Story a lot, so if you haven't seen either this or that, there may be spoilers, nothing huge that will ruin the story.\r\nClannad is broken up into 4 or 5 different stories. Each story talks about a characters' past or their relationships with others. Tomoya and friends then solve some problem which brings them all close together, yay. The thing is, these new relationships mean nothing. For example, the girl with the dead parents. When that littlestory is over, does she actually even do anything? No. All it was meant for to develop Tomoya's character and bring him closer to Nagisa.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole anime is about bringing Tomoya and Nagisa together. There seems to be no real conflict the whole time other than possibly the music club. A little conflict is introduced here and there for the aforementioned stories, but they do little to have any storyline whatsoever. It's 4-6 kids doing weird stuff and running around accomplishing seemingly meaningless tasks.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, I feel like After Story is the best part of the series. It seems like these 23 episodes were just meant to give the watcher feelings for the relationship so AS would have more of an effect. It continues into After Story though, the first 10ish episodes are also stupid scenarios. \\n\\n\r\nIt is best to bear through the pointless adventures of the gang to get to the meat and potatoes of the series. \\n\\n",
