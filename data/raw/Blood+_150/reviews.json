            "content": "A show about a girl who fights monsters... sounds kind of unoriginal, no? Well, whatever it sounds like to you, this is one helluva awesome show :D\r\nThe story is dark, sad and action-packed. I like how they present everything with a sad setting; it's not like it's just one big brawl after another; it is emotions and resolve-strengthening, it's battles which have a reason other than just being yet another battle. The story keeps complex but simple enough to follow without too much thinking \"what's happening?\"\r\nThe animation style in Blood+ is really cool. It's got good shading details, and the characters looks good too; they'vegot a nice variation of character designs, some detailed and some maybe not so detailed. The animation is flawless; at least no noticeable errors. The background art in this series is amazing; the sceneries and cityscapes are wonderful to look at.\\n\\n\r\nThe music rocks too. The OP/ED songs are great (aside the fourth OP, which was all but good), and the background music is just as it should be; moody. It sets the right mood to all the scenes, and it fits very good with the series' sad tone.\\n\\n\r\nBlood+ has the best character development of any anime I've watched. I'm completely enthralled by its characters, and how they change during the course of the series. They're deep, three-dimensional characters, and their relationships with each other are fascinating. I also like how a simple death during the beginning of the series had a large effect on the characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like about Blood+ is that despite being about vampires, it focuses on almost anything but the vampire aspects of the characters, with the latter being used mainly as a MacGuffin. Therefore, you'll enjoy this series even if you do not like vampire anime, and you'll love it if you like vampire anime.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Blood+ is among the better series in the vast world that is anime, and a series you'll enjoy watching.\\n\\n\r\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)",

            "content": "This anime is one of the best ones that I have ever seen before in my life. The plot somehow manages to stay incredibly strong throughout all of the 50 episodes, showcasing many different types of characters, from the most comical to the most radically serious. The animation has a very unique style, which somewhat surprised me early on, but then I realized that it simply made the show more unique.\r\nWhat every viewer must realize first off is that this is NOT just an anime about vampires. The fact that the characters often require blood to survive is used as an effective plot device,but it is not the entire focus of the show. What this means is that it appeals to both those who love vampire animes and those who do not, creating, as a whole, an extremely balanced, well crafted anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime will be a joy for anyone who watches it. The storyline ranges from romance, to comedy, to intrigue, to detailed pseudo-history, innocence and experience, violence and peace, and then circles around again to the vague but omnipresent romance that insinuates itself, not as the main focus, but as a continuing theme throughout.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed watching the anime, and I invite all who read this to do the same.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n",

            "content": "Note: If you found this review helpful (or not), leave me a PM or comment, and give me some constructive criticism!\r\nPost-note: All scores are compared to titles I have watched personally and represent the verbal \"score\" of that number, with a 7 meaning \" Good\". It is unrelated to the 1-10 grading that a lot of people seem to solely apply, without thinking of what it means.\r\nSo. Blood+\r\nOriginally an offshoot of an earlier movie, Blood+ combines both existing elements present in anime and new ones, to create a somewhat unique shonen (yes, shonen, because that's what this is, don't be fooled by the R+ rating)title. The original premise, that of cute girl with big sword fighting large monsters has been done many times before, but it is the encompassing plot and character designs that make this title stand out.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that that the writers obviously wanted this series to stand out compared to a lot of other drab that comes out nowadays is evident. Sharp character designs (lack of moe characters) are the norm, and the plot line aims to be as realistic as possible, including many existing locations throughout the modern world. from Japan to Russia to France, it becomes evident that the animators have at least glanced at existing sceneries before sketching the locations where the story takes place.\\n\\n\r\nWe can understand the actions of certain characters (if the motifs have been revealed), and often the distinction between good and evil becomes blurred, something which lacks in a lot of series nowadays, where differences are usually black and white, with not much repose in between.\\n\\n\r\nThen, you may ask \" Why give it a 7?\".\\n\r\nFirst note that a 7 to me means \" Good\", it holds no numerical value. Blood+ is a good show, but it doesn't have any factors that make it stand out to the point where, maybe a year later, you think \"wow, that was quite a memorable show\". \\n\\n\r\nIt is the same factor that makes it unique, that drags it down. The score is pulled down because of the lack of realism in a show that aims to include many elements pulled straight out of the 21st century world for the sake of appearing realistic and well thought through.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a scene where a protagonist is being pursued. He flees into a park, filled with happy picnickers. He rests momentarily on a bench, when suddenly his pursuer appears again. He runs through the  park, but to our surprise, all those picnickers have disappeared. Is the director implying that in the few seconds that the camera pans away, all those men and women decided to pack up and leave? This incident is not standalone, and quite often outsiders (to the plot) seem to act illogically, or simply disappear solely for the sake of furthering a plot line and making the actions of characters seem logical. \\n\\n\r\nAnother small, annoying factor is that all characters seem to be able to speak to anyone on the globe. Now honestly, I don't believe that the entire world has started speaking Japanese overnight. This can be overlooked to a certain extent however, since such reasoning seems to be prevalent in many shonen titles.\\n\\n\r\nAnother factor pulling down an otherwise very good show, is the seemingly low budget of Blood+. It affects many of the most dominant factors determining the success of a show, plot, animation and sound. Firstly, the plot seems to suffer because directors and producers felt it necessary to include a lot of tangents, which lead nowhere. The entire series could have been done in 3/4ths of the 50 episodes that it runs for or less. Secondly, the lack of CG animation and lanky movements at times takes away from a series that includes a lot of fight scenes. Although it does give it some sort of visual appeal, it would have been much better executed with a larger animation budget. \\n\\n\r\nSound is another factor pulling it down. Although there are some good tracks in the OST, which are nice to the ear, the repetition and overuse of them is simply irritating, especially for a longer anime like Blood+. The OP and ED are of the common staple, including well known (at least, for us anime fans) J-Rock bands such as UVERworld and Hyde. Certainly not bad, but not very original either. Voice acting isn't terribly great either, although the actors can convey different emotions, it is not entirely convincing either.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, personally I found the lack of a deeper \" meaningful\" plot line distasteful. Although certainly not needed, it would have brought the enjoyment factor up quite a bit. Simply following the story of the main protagonist, Saya, can be a bore at times, especially when it becomes overly melodramatic.\\n\\n\r\nPushing my criticism aside, Blood+ certainly isn't a bad series. Even with these somewhat irritating flaws, it is still much better than a lot of Shonen titles nowadays, and for anyone simply wanting some enjoyment without a too much engrossing plot, i'd certainly recommend this. However, for anyone looking for something deeper, something with, say, moralistic or idealistic principles, i'd tell you to look further, because this wouldn't be for you.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended for: (more serious) Shonen fans, those looking for something different than average.\\n\\n\r\nNot recommended for: Fans of moe character designs, serious Seinen fans.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I used to watch a fair amount of anime, but over the past few years, my interest in it had been gradually waning, partly because of the decreasing number of good shows being produced, and partly because of lack of time due to my heavy workload.\r\n     However, this trend was reversed when I had the good fortune of coming across Blood+. I had never heard of it before, but the premise seemed interesting enough, though not particularly original or unique. I decided to give it a shot, expecting at least a decent and entertaining show but notmuch more than that.\\n\\n\r\n     But what I got was much, much more I had dared to hoped for. What starts out as a fairly conventional storyline gradually unravels, revealing a vastly more complex and intricate narrative tapestry. Its deliberate pacing may be misconstrued by some as being &quot;slow&quot;, but as the story progresses, all the puzzle pieces that are uncovered early on start to fall into place, and things that once seemed insignificant or nonsensical begin to make sense.\\n\\n\r\n     As for the technical merits of this show, other people have already discussed its superb animation and hauntingly evocative soundtrack, so I won't go into too much detail on them. Suffice it to say that they complement the mood of the series exceptionally well.\\n\\n\r\n     However, what really won me over was the exceptional character development displayed here. Without giving too much away, I can say that these characters actually felt like real, living, breathing people and not just 2-D images on the TV screen. They change and evolve as time goes by, and after a particular event occurs, don't be surprised if you find yourself regarding certain characters in a totally different light.\\n\\n\r\n     To make a long story short, Blood+ is one of only a handful of shows that transcends the boundaries of its genre, and one of the best animes I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. In fact, it practically single-handedly revived my passion for anime and spurred me on to seek many other great shows, which I probably would not have bothered to watch otherwise. And that is probably the greatest compliment one can pay to any medium of entertainment.",

            "content": "Blood+ offers up an alternate take of the events from Blood: The Last Vampire featuring Saya's hunt of the Chiropteran creature threat. Being at 50 episodes of length, this gives the series plenty of time to build up on events with its plot and explore the causes that led to the Chiropteran threat being as serious as it did. It also expands on Saya's character and the mysterious organization (Red Shield) aiding her in thwarting the Chiropteran threat.\r\nIn terms of characterization, the series does enough to flesh out prominent characters that influence Saya's decisions from those who serve to allow her to retain the normalcyshe seeks with her adoptive brothers Kai and Riku to those in Red Shield in need of her to those who remind her of her Chiropteran roots in the form of Hagi. The series does enough to have you believe that she cherishes said relationships and even those that she comes to newly establish as she learns more of her origins and the nature of the Chiropteran threat. It also does a decent job at exploring the inner conflict that Saya's character experiences as she comes to grips with her origins as a Chiroptera and determining what she desires despite being different from her adoptive human family.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the plot, Blood+ does get fairly complex as it introduces several factions with differing motivations concerning the Chiropteran threat that involve its dominance, elimination or using the threat for personal gain. The first half is focused on slowly unveiling these factions and their motivations, as well as elements to Saya's past that she finds herself having to come to terms with. The unveiling of these elements lead to some foreign locales outside of Japan such as Vietnam and New York City. The second half is where events begin to build up where some prominent characters are killed off and characters gradually change as a result of the Chiropteran. This becomes prominent in a time skip which features some of the major characters having changed in personality and personal beliefs as a result of the events that took place from earlier episodes in the series.\\n\\n\r\nBlood+ does some from some major issues for me though. While enough is fleshed out with Saya and some prominent characters on her side, I felt that anything involving Diva and her Chevaliers were quite underdeveloped as we don't get much dimension or depth about their motivations with some of the Chevaliers seemingly being around just to serve as obstacles in Saya's hunt for Diva and to expand the cast. It also got in the habit of going into some sub-plots that did little to develop major elements of the series; particularly Mao and the reporter's quest to catch up with Kai, Saya and the Red Shield agents.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visual presentation, Blood+ does sport clean details with its settings and character designs with a subdued color palette that do well at painting the show's dark mood. The series does well at visually depicting a variety of different settings thanks to the different locations that Saya and others travel to from the beaches of Okinawa to the barren tropical forests of Vietnam to the vast city landscape of New York City. The designs for the Chiropterans are diverse and make for a great treat to see on the screen. However for a series seemingly hyping itself on its monster-slaughtering action, Blood+ is hit-or-miss in animation. The series does have its moments in depicting some good scenes such as some aerial battles and close combat confrontations, but I did spot some prominent shortcuts with animation which include still-shots within moving backgrounds to simulate movement and the use of blur effects to depict fast movements coming from the Chiropteran characters.\\n\\n\r\nFor the show's soundtrack, Blood+ often makes use of piano and classical musical pieces for insert music to depict its dramatic situations which fit perfectly with the drama seen frequently throughout the show. The show's various OP and ED sequences tended to be hit-or-miss for me with how I enjoyed them and quite often being either too gentle or intense in fitting with Blood+'s mood. The only one that caught my interest was the 2nd OP from Hyde's \"Season's Call\" which fit well with the mood in which the series was conveying.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Blood+ was a decent supernatural action/ drama that did enough at slowly fleshing out elements to its series and exploring how the prominent characters come to grips with knowing more about the Chiropteran, especially as Saya comes to grips with her own connections to it. However, the lack of fleshing out on many prominent characters among the antagonists does make it tough to connect with them without such developments and the focus on some irrelevant sub-plots does hamper the quality of the show's plotting. Still, the series does make for a decent watch and it beats the original movie in terms of delivering a quality plot and fleshed-out characters with its supernatural action.",

            "content": "When Blood+ came out back in 2005, it was one of the seasons most anticipated releases. The original work, Blood: The Last Vampire, screamed for a longer storyline that showed some development. And while Blood+ was to take place in a separate universe, if it managed to construct a decent story around the beautiful aesthetics of the film, then we would have had a definite winner. Sadly, Blood+ is, to put it bluntly, a bit of a mess. \r\nBlood+ starts off decent enough. Saya, our protagonist, is revealed to be the only one capable of killing the human killing, blood sucking chiropterans. Early on, abit os a standard \"mysterious past\" is established, although over the course of 50 episodes, it's never explained as well as it probably should have banned. Those hoping for a one woman show, like Blood: The Last Vampire, may also find it interesting that Blood+ sort of becomes a band of travelers movie with Saya's close friends, Riku and Kai, and her guardian of sort, the mysterious cello playing Hagi.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest problems of this show is that so many of its elements are very, very conventional. Saya is an amnesia sufferer who has \"forgotten\" about her past as a bloody killer. The American military is interfering in the role of vampires, which would have made for a decent little conspiracy story, if predictable, if it was fully explored. We are also treated to a bevy of corny \"live your life for today\" speeches from the likes of Saya's friends. It's all very standard fare.\\n\\n\r\nThis wouldn't have been too bad, and would have been saved in part by the decently exciting action, if the series wasn't so arbitrary. New rules and twists are introduced haphazardly to the plot at seemingly unfit times. The Schiff, who are basically manufactured vampires, are tossed into the mix lazily, and their new set of rules and characters pops up and then is sort of left behind as the series progresses. This is how a lot of the second half of the show works. As Saya pursues Diva, the head honcho of the bad guys, all kinds of unexplored sub-plots are layered on; besides the aforementioned Schiff, we have some conflict between Diva's guardians (they're the bad guy equivalent of Hagi, basically), and political dealings with the American military, but they all feel terribly unimportant and underdeveloped, because the show ends up basically becoming one long, protracted chase scene, with Saya desperately trying to locate Diva and defeat her once and for all. This is extended by a relentless number of fight scenes that begin to lose their importance as we realize they are basically just delaying the final showdown.\\n\\n\r\nThe show becomes simultaneously bogged down by the unneeded subplots, as well as too narrow-minded in how it chooses to be \"mysterious\" about all the characters and backgrounds. No, a show needn't spell out everything for the viewer, but we're never really given much to go on, if anything, from Saya, Hagi, and Diva and her cronies. Even as one of the antagonists essentially falls in love with Saya, it all feels very rushed and heavy-handed. While the pacing manages to keep the show watchable, it becomes so repetitive and predictable that it fails to stand out.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending itself is something pretty much any viewer will be able to see from a mile away (and it has to do with another weird arbitrary rule that seems to be heaped on just to attempt to make it sad). Because of this, the emotional punch it is supposed to provide is more like an emotional feather dusting.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some positives, the animation is good, even if it lacks the dark appeal of The Last Vampire. The various world locations we get to see manage to help keep things varied.  Kai becomes an interesting character with a soft-side to go along with his rambunctious one, that we can really empathize with. The action is generally pretty exciting at first. But the show just wears out its welcome with the arbitrary introduction of new ideas and characters that are often abandoned simply to fit the plot. It makes you wonder why they were needed in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, this all leaves Blood+ as a watchable, but simplistic and by-the-numbers vampire flick.\\n\\n\r\n3/10\\n",

            "content": "Blood+ was recommended to me by a friend about five months ago. After being briefed on the basic plotline by her I was less than impressed to say the least, after all, one girl fighting the forces of evil (Or in this case Chiroptera) with her band of merry men, it was an idea done many a time before (Just look at Buffy the Vampire Slayer!) Yet I decided to give it a go regardless. I was delighted to find myself proved wrong however after finishing the anime just a few weeks later. I\u2019ve since re-watched it twice and would definitely recommend it to anyonewith brilliant taste in anime!\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Blood+ is one filled with compelling fight scenes, tension and mystery right until the very final episode. One of the greatest things about this anime is that the storyline constantly has the viewer guessing what will happen next without the plotline becoming predictable. Every small detail links in perfectly with the story, resulting in a perfectly rounded off anime that will delight even those who don\u2019t usually enjoy anime of the vampire genre.\\n\\n\r\nYet another great thing about Blood+ is the amazing cast of characters. Unlike some anime (Not mentioning any names here!) the characters actually have development, and a lot of it at that! As you progress through the show the characters will undergo some kind of hardship or test and blossom before your very eyes as a result of it, making them real easy to get attached to! The interactions between the different characters are ingenious and not always lacking in humour despite the dark tone of the anime! Not only do the characters develop themselves but develop their relationships with the other characters as well! Saya, the main character herself is interesting, adorably naive and fairly easy to relate to, which can rarely be said for the main hero/heroine of a genre such as this so I feel as though this is a real achievement!\\n\\n\r\nOut of the many anime I\u2019ve seen in my time Blood+ has one of the most unique animation styles out there! The characters are interesting to look at and well in proportion throughout the entire series. Not once did I glance at a character and think, hang on a minute! I swear he had a larger nose in that last shot! The backgrounds are beautifully laid out and detailed and the shading is done at the level of a pro! Perfection!\\n\\n\r\nEven the music is perfect! The underlining score fits in well with the sad and dark tone of the anime, sometimes all it took for me to start balling like a baby at a sad scene was for this particular theme to start playing softly in the background. So yeah, the music just adds to the brilliance of this amazing anime! The OP/Ed themes were pretty much flawless as well! Okay, admittedly I preferred some more than other but everyone is entitled to their own opinion, right?\\n\\n\r\nSo Perhaps one of my favourite things about the show Blood+ is that despite it being an anime chock-a-bloc with deep, meaningful life lessons it never becomes too cheesy. I myself don\u2019t seem to recall any big emotional speeches on the power of friendship, or believing in oneself which to be honest is a welcome relief! Despite the story-line having a fair amount of plot-twists and unexpected happenings the anime never becomes too complicated either, as I was soon to learn, everything happens for a reason!\\n\\n\r\nSo that\u2019s that then! Now you know of the wonder that is Blood+ At least, I hope you do, this is my first review you see so I hope I\u2019ve done the show some ruddy justice! It\u2019s the least it deserves for keeping me entertained and on the edge of my seat for three damn weeks! So go watch it already, I promise you won\u2019t be disappointed! \\n",

            "content": "Blood+ was truly an interesting anime - it requires patience but once one starts to get accustomed with the pace and characters, it is an amazing anime.\r\nStory wise Blood+ starts slow. It takes time to develop, to let the elements of the story, for the characters to interact naturally rather than forcing them into a swirling bog to just push the story ahead. And it starts with the basic anime form: The basic elements are put forth - Chiropteran and Saya. One can assume that with the progression of stronger foes and conflicting feelings, there is nothing more to the anime than the main characterwho is initially weak growing stronger to face all foes.\\n\\n\r\nHowever as the story progresses one finds out that it is not so. There will be additional elements which do not appear as a new boss might when the previous one dies. They actually develop a very intricate plot. And it's approach is slow. It takes four  to five episodes to let the character figure his/her own weakness and then stabilize as they would in a real world scenario. Claymore on the other hand (ignoring how its story progresses) manages to do all that in the first episode. Gantz takes up to three episodes for that.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this progression initially feels slow in contrast to animes like Mirai Nikki or Sword Art Online it becomes a positive because unnecessary character development and huge increments in power is avoided and there is time for small plot details to be handled. The story starts taking proper shape around the tenth episode and for a fifty episode anime that isn't too slow. There are various side stories and endeavors that combine together and connect (sometimes too big a coincidence) and keep the viewer up to date with all the characters. It is also a clever way of telling parts of the story from another perspective.\\n\\n\r\nSo all in all it has a very complex and well thought story and yes - if I want I can sit down and find faults like \"did they close the gate or not\" but it is a good thing that in the entire anime such frivolous events are taken for granted. Meaning thinking about the guards changing shift is not our business.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style isn't that bad for its time. The backgrounds are good and at times rather beautiful in terms of vibrant colors in contrast to dull underground moments. There isn't a fixed atmosphere, one will be able to see light slice of life like moments and one will see bloody sequences. And neither feel out of place.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are mixed - Saya and Haji and Solomon (regardless of his stereotypical prince look) are drawn well - they have their physical traits that show detail in their art work. However there are a few characters (Kai for instance) that just seem like a few lines under a scruff of hair at times. It isn't that distracting but at times I feel Kai lose expressions or originality other than his hair. However this is being critical - the characters are more or less consistent with real-life proportions and we have one piece as well in which some character faces are very basic (ignoring the unrealistic proportions they at times have).\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks in Blood+ Mostly left a positive impression on me - they had a nice gist to them and they were timed well. Emotions and scenario's are well expressed through suitable sound tracks. Fighting sequences were well complimented and so were the slice of life moments - much like the art they managed both sides well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was a big positive for me in this anime. Yes, we do have the hero that at times is swayed and needs memories and friends n family to go through tough times but there is quite some work put in the development of different characters - some subtle characteristics that one notices afterwards and also traits that make them less predictable in the anime realm.\\n\\n\r\nSaya - as an instance did portray the typical shounen main hero (Ichigo for example) in which they are people who preach justice all the time and are against fighting (a better example would be Yuuto from Omamori Himari) however as the story progresses she gets stronger and mentally more mature and sees the situation from a different light - something that doesn't happen in a day or so.\\n\\n\r\nKai, as much as I find his art style in the start not too good - is a good character, impulsive and daring however he isn't the guy you would always expect to go haywire due to his personality, who butts into everything for the sake of protecting everyone. Wow... that kind of reminds me of Kato in Gantz... although he was also properly crafted, a little less multi faceted as he was.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment wise it will take the anime about ten episodes to kick in - but then the believable characters, the complex plot, all of these elements combine to give what I'd say is one of the best animes I have seen. It is well balanced - not diving into a world of needless action, nor is it slow enough to bore you.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading and feedback is always appreciated.",

            "content": "Story: Any vampire fans would appreciate the story; the ever-reusable (and reused) vampire legend gets a new spin here. From the very first episode, the main character Saya is unwittingly thrown into a fight for humanity that only she can put an end to. Accompanied by her (sexy) cellist guardian who has some link to her, she sets out to rid the world of the vampire-like chiropterans plaguing the earth. Fortunately for us, the story is quite a bit more complex than that. Very soon into the series, the story becomes deeper, with many twists revealed about Saya and her dark past. \r\nArt: From whatI have seen, this has a very unique art style, especially in that all the characters actually look unique. I'm referring to many other series where the characters all look ridiculously similar since they were designed by the same person. Also, the show has a decidedly dark atmosphere which is wonderfully presented in the animation. If you are a fan of much blood, also take comfort in knowing you'll find a lot here. It is in the title, after all.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Personally I'm not a fan of any of the opening or closing themes, but the soundtrack is one of my favorites from any anime. Mark Mancina composed the score for Blood+ (turning him into an anime fan in the process) and was helped by Hans Zimmer, so it's the first anime I've seen where the music was written by someone not actually Japanese. Mancina's rich score is perfect for the show. The voice actors did wonderfully as well. Noteworthy is Kari Wahlgren as Saya (though I didn't approve of using her for Diva, too, whom she rather botched) and Crispin Freeman as Haji (for some reason, the mysterious and seemingly emotionless characters suit him). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Character development is great here, thanks mostly to Saya, who must grow from the timid amnesiac she begins the show as to a strong female warrior, and it is interesting to watch how this transformation really takes a toll on her personality. The other supporting characters also help contribute to the character development, to a certain extent. After my own heart, the show's creators let the audience in on the villain's side many times, allowing us to see their plans before the other characters do. Hooray for dramatic irony and moving forward of plotlines!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: As I mentioned earlier, vampire fans who are sick of the &quot;same ol&rsquo;, same ol&rsquo;&quot; vampire stories will love this one. Really, the only similarity between &quot;traditional&quot; vampires and the ones in Blood+ are that they drink blood. Speaking of blood, if you are squeamish at the sight of cartoon blood, keep away from this for obvious reasons, as it would inhibit your enjoyment of the series tremendously. Anyone else would like Blood+ since it has a good amount of action, but doesn't deviate from the main plotline, which is surprisingly complex. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Unless you don't like really violent anime, I would recommend this to anyone who likes vampires, action, drama, romance, and a good plot. And sexy cellists.\\n",

The beginning was extremely interesting, but after a while, it just got kinda boring, and in the end, I felt as if I had wasted a lot of my time. It could have ended a lot earlier instead of making it 50 episodes.\r\nThe emphasis is more on the characters than the action, and all the fights are pretty much the same. Nothing that would really amaze me. This would have been alright ifit weren't for the fact that most of the characters were just annoying. I really couldn't stand Kai, especially considering how his relationship with Mao turned out. Saya was still unlikeable even after she seemed to have matured after the one year time skip. I really didn't enjoy Blood+. It had an interesting story, but it was brought down by poor execution and direction.",

            "content": "When I saw about 15 episodes of Blood+, a friend asked me how was it. I said it was boring and dull, with some nice fighting scenes once in a while. After another 10-15 episodes, another friend asked me for my opinion on Blood+. I said it was one of the best anime series I saw this year. How do I feel after finishing the whole 50 chapters? Lets start from the beginning. \r\nBlood+ revolves around a story of a \"young\" girl who is the only person on the planet able to fight vampire-like monsters, called Chiropterans, and wants to find out about her troubledpast. But my biggest &quot;wow&quot; is not going to the plot (which sounds a little familiar to all of us). I have two big &quot;wows,&quot; actually. One is for graphics and one is for sound. Beautifully pictured landscapes across the world, pleasant characters and intense, realistic fight scenes will give your eyes a definite present. And what better way to complete this piece of art than adding an elegant soundtrack (Haji playing J.S. Bach on his cello is now in my top 10 anime moments ever) which polishes the sophistication and intelligence of this series. These are the things that keep you loyal to Blood+ and gives you a feeling that it is not an ordinary story. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, we have to be fair and talk a little about the downside of this series. Firstly, even if the story sounds kind of old, it is actually very complicated at times. You have to follow the conspiracies behind politics, the stories of Saya and other main characters, understand the importance of some individuals who don't really look important and so on. At one point I have to confess, I was tired of listening to story lines about Red Shield and Cinq Fleches organizations and all the problems they had when I just knew it was all about Saya, she is the one who can end this and she should be the main point of discussion. Therefore, prepare yourself for long conversations that could sometimes seem meaningless and if you are an &quot;action guy/girl&quot; you could be a bit disappointed. \\n\\n\r\n So, what is my final judgment? Well, I said to myself earlier in the series that the ending will probably decide the true quality of Blood+. However, although it wasn't as predictable as I thought it would be, I can't say that it left me unsatisfied. Actually, for some reason, I felt that I respect this anime series even more than I did in the beginning (especially after I saw the movie that this series evolved from, yuck). Do I recommend Blood+? Absolutely. There will be at least few moments when you will adore the characters and enjoy the story that we sometimes fantasize of being a part of. \\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S. IF YOU DID NOT WATCHED BLOOD+ YET, DO NOT READ THIS! \\n\r\nA part of me is still screaming for an ending where Saya falls asleep at the last moment of the fight against Diva, leaving the world domination to the Chiropterans. Then waking up 30 years from that fight, reuniting with Haji and trying to clean up the twisted future from these monsters. Now, tell me, it is not your ideal ending! And what a sequel it would be! The studios should definitely let the fans of anime create endings sometimes.",

If you want to enjoy an anime with a dark tune, complex story and really great charakter development, Blood+ would be a good choice! But beware if you get too close to certain charakters, your heart might get broken!\r\nIf you are looking for a fun and happy anime series, don't watch it. As I said before the anime is rather dark and as the name says bloody. There are some scenes that can be considered cruel (not only in a physical way).\r\nAnd one more warning, before the praise: If you're expecting tonsof action filled scenes, there will be some, but not as many as you might expect. Don't watch it if you get easily bored if there is no fight every five minutes. \\n\\n\r\nVery short summary: Saya needs to fight vampirelike creatures called Chiropteran, only she can kill. At her side are her friends, that support her and whom she wishes to protect. Her enemies on the other hand wish to create a world filled with Chiropterans and try to persuade Saya, that she should support them.\\n\\n\r\nOf course there is as usual a good side and a bad side. However Sayas enemies are not all pictured pure evil. There is no absolute black and white sight. Neither is Saya pictured as a flawless heroine. At some point you might even find yourself to be a little repelled.\\n\r\nThere are many episodes that follow a rather slow tune and can look like filler episodes at first glance. I still enjoyed them, because they showed how the characters changed as a response to all the traumatic things happening to them. It makes them all the more believable and helped me to get attached to them.\\n\\n\r\nI watched Blood+ two times now. The first time I was much younger than now. The second time I found myself beeing drawn to different characters than the first time. So this might be a sign that there is someone to like for younger and older people ;)\\n\\n\r\nAnd last but not least, soundtrack and art are amazing! It fits the scenes very well and manages greatly to draw you in! \\n\\n\r\nI hope this was helpful to you! Enjoy watching!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The story only gets better as the anime goes on, and the characters are all entrancing.  It is not your normal vampire anime, but has a very unique view and intriguing plot that is believable.  The only problem may be the English version of the anime.  I find the voice actors completely off par with the Japanese voice actors, though I feel this way about most : )  The music is alsoamazing, with some great j-rock songs and an amazing song sung by the character Diva.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes darker, more serious anime with just enough humor that the drama is not overbearing.",

            "content": "An excellent anime that holds a captivating and suspenseful story plot. Blood+ is definitely a must watch anime and one that should be re-watched over and over. It is one anime that has supernatural features, slight parts of romance, and even some historical event correlation intertwined in this fictional world that has the inhabitants called chiropterans; bat-like creatures that feast on human blood. I, myself am not one who favors all gore and blood soaked scenes, but the story in Blood+ really captivates me. The bloody fight scenes all connect to the main plot and is not one excessive blood fest. Plus, this anime isone of those shows that gets you &quot;hooked&quot; and makes you think strategically and use problem-solving to sort of determine what is what and how things work. \\n\\n\r\nNow getting to the characters, they are wonderfully drawn and thought out, each with their own obvious personality. Even with the side-characters, they all equally stand out and none are really overshadowed. It isn't one of those animes that add filler characters to let the story drag on and what not. Once characters are drawn in Blood+, they are kept and have their own scene time throughout the whole thing (meaning Saya is not the center of all the attention).\\n\\n\r\nOne downfall to the characters are their character development. Most of the time, they hold rare emotional view points and don't develop quite as fast. When watching, one usually feels a part of the anime (if it's a really good one), but the characters perceived by myself are somewhat 2-D and impersonal. Other than that, this anime is of course a great one that should be on everyone's watched/will watch list and even though I am not even finished with it yet, I am most definitely impressed with high standards and cannot believe how I missed watching such an excellent anime.\\n",

Once I got started, I could hardly stop.\r\nIt is interesting to see the change the main character goes through, and it is a very interesting relationship she had to people around her.\r\nAt first, the story may seem confusing, but of course it all comes together as you get more and more into the story. You don't know more than Saya, which makes it easy to get as frustarated as her, making you want to find out which again makes you hang on to it.\r\nI wasn't too impressed with the artwork, but it can be nice not to always look at the shiny,wild colored hair and eyes.\\n\r\nAs it isn't really a comical anime, it does contain comedy, but none of the well-known extreme anime drawings with chibi figures. This makes the story more &quot;serious&quot;, and is certainly a plus!\\n\r\nThe art isn't too detailed though, and it's nothing spectacular, but definitely NOT bad! Depends on preferance.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good, and it's impressing how different the tracks are made, though it's based on the same three or four melodies. Very well composed.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very deep, and you can sort of predict how they will react to different situations as yo get to know them. Tthe chracters are also very different, and all in all well made.\\n\\n\r\nIt has a good length - doesn't get boring or drawn out. Once you finish the anime, it makes you sad because you really want it to continue!\\n\r\nIt also has an open ending, making YOU the boss of what is going to happen in the future, which is very nice.\\n\\n\r\nI can ONLY recommend this anime; both if you're a guy or a girl, into romance or action - it really has it all. An anime I couldn't get my eyes off once I got started!",

The characters are all lovable, even the villains, and the way the story slowly reveals itself just makes you keep wanting more. I kept finding myself watching episode after episode into the wee hours in the morning, telling myself I'd just watch one more, but watching another after that and another after that. And the ending? Many things happened that I didn't expect, I was left pleasantly surprised. I was very happy withthe ending, and the entire anime overall. I highly recommend this anime, as long as you don't mind some (a lot of) animated blood.",

            "content": "Can't be denied, the anime produced by Aniplex is always interesting and inspiring like Gintama or Fate / Zero.\r\nBlood + is also the production of flavors and Aniplex has its own story where the anime is the theme of vampires in a different package, generally described the figure of handsome vampire or a mysterious figure, but Blood + presents a different case in which the vampire portrayed beautiful women and strong\r\nThe story that took place in various countries presents a different atmosphere where spectators are invited adventure with Blood +.\r\nBasically this anime is a story about a protagonist Otonashi memory loss in the past andthe journey he was accompanied by Haji (Chaveliar) to find the fragments of memory in the past and reveal who he really is and why he must fight against Chiropetra. There are so many conflicts and emotions happen in this anime, especially Kai's brother who is a regular guy who tried to protect Otonashi and Riku, but in the end he had to lose Riku Otonashi but managed to bring home with great happiness.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10\\n\r\nThe story is presented is too simple and predictable. Only centered on the pursuit Otonashi Diva to kill him and end the story of his adventures. Due to the anime just centered on one character alone that the author forgot to develop the leaders began to seem monotonous and a half episode proved very slow and centered on the same thing.\\n\r\nBut I appreciate the creativity of the author in which he presents the background of a different vampire. Not only that drama, the bond of brotherhood, friendship seems so strong and proven where Kai which is a sister of Otonashi are not bound by blood relations regard it as his own brother, a friendship between man and Sif Chevaliar too strong.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nPicture of this anime seems so ordinary, nothing interesting is evident from home in Japan and various countries. But what impressed me was the city where the author can draw in countries such detail shown on the outskirts of the Vietnam looks exactly the atmosphere there, Russia and the surrounding city look so cool and modern American impressed. Not only is it a pretty good picture of Chiropetra\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nDo not really remember the Sound of this anime, because he had not seen it. But by giving a score of 7 is enough for recall soundtrack and sound so good at fighting and thrilling moments is quite fitting\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nThis is where the value of this anime, talk about the character means to talk about social relations and psychology. Character of this anime was so strong and there is no proven falsity of the story and from 1 until the end of the character of the anime is growing and convincing.\\n\r\nGeorge: where he managed to portray a father, how he educated his children, giving courage and most importantly how to live in the world when it is clear they are not the biological child.\\n\r\nOtonashi, I: at first he was so cheerful and happy look on every day but when the adventures of the character began to change more mature and intelligent attention of those around proven Solomon fell in love with him but he's still just a pity he felt this was an introvert in which all the mistakes and the like solve their own problems when people around him continue to support it\\n\r\nKai: an older brother had played a character with both arguably even close to perfect as a figure of a boy. Evidently, where he continued to accompany her sister Otonashi which is continuing to support wherever and whenever the end of a long hibernation. An inspiration to friends around him, especially the Sif\\n\r\nHajj: the mysterious figure's loyal and who successfully brought by Haji. He not only serves Otonashi but because of his love he could grant all hope of Otonashi. But the remarkable here is that even though he's loyal servant and Otonashi proven he's not stupid at the end of the episode where Otonashi Haji wants to die but not granted and advised to continue to live and smile every day.\\n\r\nThere are so many valuable lessons in this anime is the time in which to solve puzzles and fishing character gives advice on how to resolve the issue wisely and meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nThis is what makes the time a little disappointed of this anime, the story is slow and continues to focus on one story with a character until the middle of the last episode makes the writer feel uncomfortable and want to decide to stop this anime. But in mid-last episode of this anime started to find his way and completely comfortable watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOveral 35/5: 7\\n\r\nYes, that's enough value for the anime, as the authors assess the terms of the story so that it is sufficient for the anime horror genre Action",

This young girl whose name is Saya is no ordinary girl because she is the only person in the world who can fight against Chiropterans, which are monsters that feed on blood of living humans and can look like humanswhen they want. \\n\r\nThere are alot of twists and turn which make the story really good\\n\\n\r\nArt : 10\\n\r\n The animation was really good for its time and Charcters looked really good.

It has a nice dark tone to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharcters: 10\\n\r\nWhats kool about blood + is that they have great protagnists and atagonists. The bad guys really get good character development and so Does Saya and her freinds.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the series more than I thought I would. I watched 12 episodes on adult swim network long time ago and never came back to  it I kept putting it off thinking it probally won't be that good of a series but I was wrong it easily became one the better anime series I have watched in a long time. There are some boring episodes thrown in everyone once in a while so thats why i gave it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10\\n\r\nIf you see my anime list you can see i give really good scores usally 10s to alot of the series I have watched. Basically if enjoyed the series it is going to get a 9 or 10 from me. Blood + is something that every anime fan can enjoy because it has alot of drama and alot action to keep your attention.",

Well, whatever it sounds like to you, this is one helluva awesome show :D\r\nThe story is dark, sad and action-packed. I like how they present everything with a sad setting; it's not like it's just one big brawl after another; it is emotions and resolve-strengthening, it's battles which have a reason other than just being yet another battle. The story keeps complex but simple enough to follow without too much thinking \"what's happening?\"\r\nThe animation style in Blood+ is really cool. It's got good shading details, and the characters looks good too; they'vegot a nice variation of character designs, some detailed and some maybe not so detailed. The animation is flawless; at least no noticeable errors. The background art in this series is amazing; the sceneries and cityscapes are wonderful to look at.\\n\\n\r\nThe music rocks too. The OP/ED songs are great (aside the fourth OP, which was all but good), and the background music is just as it should be; moody. It sets the right mood to all the scenes, and it fits very good with the series' sad tone.\\n\\n\r\nBlood+ has the best character development of any anime I've watched. I'm completely enthralled by its characters, and how they change during the course of the series. They're deep, three-dimensional characters, and their relationships with each other are fascinating. I also like how a simple death during the beginning of the series had a large effect on the characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like about Blood+ is that despite being about vampires, it focuses on almost anything but the vampire aspects of the characters, with the latter being used mainly as a MacGuffin. Therefore, you'll enjoy this series even if you do not like vampire anime, and you'll love it if you like vampire anime.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Blood+ is among the better series in the vast world that is anime, and a series you'll enjoy watching.\\n\\n\r\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)",

The plot somehow manages to stay incredibly strong throughout all of the 50 episodes, showcasing many different types of characters, from the most comical to the most radically serious. The animation has a very unique style, which somewhat surprised me early on, but then I realized that it simply made the show more unique.\r\nWhat every viewer must realize first off is that this is NOT just an anime about vampires. The fact that the characters often require blood to survive is used as an effective plot device,but it is not the entire focus of the show. What this means is that it appeals to both those who love vampire animes and those who do not, creating, as a whole, an extremely balanced, well crafted anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime will be a joy for anyone who watches it. The storyline ranges from romance, to comedy, to intrigue, to detailed pseudo-history, innocence and experience, violence and peace, and then circles around again to the vague but omnipresent romance that insinuates itself, not as the main focus, but as a continuing theme throughout.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed watching the anime, and I invite all who read this to do the same.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n",

            "content": "Note: If you found this review helpful (or not), leave me a PM or comment, and give me some constructive criticism!\r\nPost-note: All scores are compared to titles I have watched personally and represent the verbal \"score\" of that number, with a 7 meaning \" Good\". It is unrelated to the 1-10 grading that a lot of people seem to solely apply, without thinking of what it means.\r\nSo. Blood+\r\nOriginally an offshoot of an earlier movie, Blood+ combines both existing elements present in anime and new ones, to create a somewhat unique shonen (yes, shonen, because that's what this is, don't be fooled by the R+ rating)title. The original premise, that of cute girl with big sword fighting large monsters has been done many times before, but it is the encompassing plot and character designs that make this title stand out.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that that the writers obviously wanted this series to stand out compared to a lot of other drab that comes out nowadays is evident. Sharp character designs (lack of moe characters) are the norm, and the plot line aims to be as realistic as possible, including many existing locations throughout the modern world. from Japan to Russia to France, it becomes evident that the animators have at least glanced at existing sceneries before sketching the locations where the story takes place.\\n\\n\r\nWe can understand the actions of certain characters (if the motifs have been revealed), and often the distinction between good and evil becomes blurred, something which lacks in a lot of series nowadays, where differences are usually black and white, with not much repose in between.\\n\\n\r\nThen, you may ask \" Why give it a 7?\".\\n\r\nFirst note that a 7 to me means \" Good\", it holds no numerical value. Blood+ is a good show, but it doesn't have any factors that make it stand out to the point where, maybe a year later, you think \"wow, that was quite a memorable show\". \\n\\n\r\nIt is the same factor that makes it unique, that drags it down. The score is pulled down because of the lack of realism in a show that aims to include many elements pulled straight out of the 21st century world for the sake of appearing realistic and well thought through.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a scene where a protagonist is being pursued. He flees into a park, filled with happy picnickers. He rests momentarily on a bench, when suddenly his pursuer appears again. He runs through the  park, but to our surprise, all those picnickers have disappeared. Is the director implying that in the few seconds that the camera pans away, all those men and women decided to pack up and leave? This incident is not standalone, and quite often outsiders (to the plot) seem to act illogically, or simply disappear solely for the sake of furthering a plot line and making the actions of characters seem logical. \\n\\n\r\nAnother small, annoying factor is that all characters seem to be able to speak to anyone on the globe. Now honestly, I don't believe that the entire world has started speaking Japanese overnight. This can be overlooked to a certain extent however, since such reasoning seems to be prevalent in many shonen titles.\\n\\n\r\nAnother factor pulling down an otherwise very good show, is the seemingly low budget of Blood+. It affects many of the most dominant factors determining the success of a show, plot, animation and sound. Firstly, the plot seems to suffer because directors and producers felt it necessary to include a lot of tangents, which lead nowhere. The entire series could have been done in 3/4ths of the 50 episodes that it runs for or less. Secondly, the lack of CG animation and lanky movements at times takes away from a series that includes a lot of fight scenes. Although it does give it some sort of visual appeal, it would have been much better executed with a larger animation budget. \\n\\n\r\nSound is another factor pulling it down. Although there are some good tracks in the OST, which are nice to the ear, the repetition and overuse of them is simply irritating, especially for a longer anime like Blood+. The OP and ED are of the common staple, including well known (at least, for us anime fans) J-Rock bands such as UVERworld and Hyde. Certainly not bad, but not very original either. Voice acting isn't terribly great either, although the actors can convey different emotions, it is not entirely convincing either.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, personally I found the lack of a deeper \" meaningful\" plot line distasteful. Although certainly not needed, it would have brought the enjoyment factor up quite a bit. Simply following the story of the main protagonist, Saya, can be a bore at times, especially when it becomes overly melodramatic.\\n\\n\r\nPushing my criticism aside, Blood+ certainly isn't a bad series. Even with these somewhat irritating flaws, it is still much better than a lot of Shonen titles nowadays, and for anyone simply wanting some enjoyment without a too much engrossing plot, i'd certainly recommend this. However, for anyone looking for something deeper, something with, say, moralistic or idealistic principles, i'd tell you to look further, because this wouldn't be for you.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended for: (more serious) Shonen fans, those looking for something different than average.\\n\\n\r\nNot recommended for: Fans of moe character designs, serious Seinen fans.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I used to watch a fair amount of anime, but over the past few years, my interest in it had been gradually waning, partly because of the decreasing number of good shows being produced, and partly because of lack of time due to my heavy workload.\r\n     However, this trend was reversed when I had the good fortune of coming across Blood+. I had never heard of it before, but the premise seemed interesting enough, though not particularly original or unique. I decided to give it a shot, expecting at least a decent and entertaining show but notmuch more than that.\\n\\n\r\n     But what I got was much, much more I had dared to hoped for. What starts out as a fairly conventional storyline gradually unravels, revealing a vastly more complex and intricate narrative tapestry. Its deliberate pacing may be misconstrued by some as being &quot;slow&quot;, but as the story progresses, all the puzzle pieces that are uncovered early on start to fall into place, and things that once seemed insignificant or nonsensical begin to make sense.\\n\\n\r\n     As for the technical merits of this show, other people have already discussed its superb animation and hauntingly evocative soundtrack, so I won't go into too much detail on them. Suffice it to say that they complement the mood of the series exceptionally well.\\n\\n\r\n     However, what really won me over was the exceptional character development displayed here. Without giving too much away, I can say that these characters actually felt like real, living, breathing people and not just 2-D images on the TV screen. They change and evolve as time goes by, and after a particular event occurs, don't be surprised if you find yourself regarding certain characters in a totally different light.\\n\\n\r\n     To make a long story short, Blood+ is one of only a handful of shows that transcends the boundaries of its genre, and one of the best animes I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. In fact, it practically single-handedly revived my passion for anime and spurred me on to seek many other great shows, which I probably would not have bothered to watch otherwise. And that is probably the greatest compliment one can pay to any medium of entertainment.",

            "content": "Blood+ offers up an alternate take of the events from Blood: The Last Vampire featuring Saya's hunt of the Chiropteran creature threat. Being at 50 episodes of length, this gives the series plenty of time to build up on events with its plot and explore the causes that led to the Chiropteran threat being as serious as it did. It also expands on Saya's character and the mysterious organization (Red Shield) aiding her in thwarting the Chiropteran threat.\r\nIn terms of characterization, the series does enough to flesh out prominent characters that influence Saya's decisions from those who serve to allow her to retain the normalcyshe seeks with her adoptive brothers Kai and Riku to those in Red Shield in need of her to those who remind her of her Chiropteran roots in the form of Hagi. The series does enough to have you believe that she cherishes said relationships and even those that she comes to newly establish as she learns more of her origins and the nature of the Chiropteran threat. It also does a decent job at exploring the inner conflict that Saya's character experiences as she comes to grips with her origins as a Chiroptera and determining what she desires despite being different from her adoptive human family.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the plot, Blood+ does get fairly complex as it introduces several factions with differing motivations concerning the Chiropteran threat that involve its dominance, elimination or using the threat for personal gain. The first half is focused on slowly unveiling these factions and their motivations, as well as elements to Saya's past that she finds herself having to come to terms with. The unveiling of these elements lead to some foreign locales outside of Japan such as Vietnam and New York City. The second half is where events begin to build up where some prominent characters are killed off and characters gradually change as a result of the Chiropteran. This becomes prominent in a time skip which features some of the major characters having changed in personality and personal beliefs as a result of the events that took place from earlier episodes in the series.\\n\\n\r\nBlood+ does some from some major issues for me though. While enough is fleshed out with Saya and some prominent characters on her side, I felt that anything involving Diva and her Chevaliers were quite underdeveloped as we don't get much dimension or depth about their motivations with some of the Chevaliers seemingly being around just to serve as obstacles in Saya's hunt for Diva and to expand the cast. It also got in the habit of going into some sub-plots that did little to develop major elements of the series; particularly Mao and the reporter's quest to catch up with Kai, Saya and the Red Shield agents.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visual presentation, Blood+ does sport clean details with its settings and character designs with a subdued color palette that do well at painting the show's dark mood. The series does well at visually depicting a variety of different settings thanks to the different locations that Saya and others travel to from the beaches of Okinawa to the barren tropical forests of Vietnam to the vast city landscape of New York City. The designs for the Chiropterans are diverse and make for a great treat to see on the screen. However for a series seemingly hyping itself on its monster-slaughtering action, Blood+ is hit-or-miss in animation. The series does have its moments in depicting some good scenes such as some aerial battles and close combat confrontations, but I did spot some prominent shortcuts with animation which include still-shots within moving backgrounds to simulate movement and the use of blur effects to depict fast movements coming from the Chiropteran characters.\\n\\n\r\nFor the show's soundtrack, Blood+ often makes use of piano and classical musical pieces for insert music to depict its dramatic situations which fit perfectly with the drama seen frequently throughout the show. The show's various OP and ED sequences tended to be hit-or-miss for me with how I enjoyed them and quite often being either too gentle or intense in fitting with Blood+'s mood. The only one that caught my interest was the 2nd OP from Hyde's \"Season's Call\" which fit well with the mood in which the series was conveying.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Blood+ was a decent supernatural action/ drama that did enough at slowly fleshing out elements to its series and exploring how the prominent characters come to grips with knowing more about the Chiropteran, especially as Saya comes to grips with her own connections to it. However, the lack of fleshing out on many prominent characters among the antagonists does make it tough to connect with them without such developments and the focus on some irrelevant sub-plots does hamper the quality of the show's plotting. Still, the series does make for a decent watch and it beats the original movie in terms of delivering a quality plot and fleshed-out characters with its supernatural action.",

            "content": "When Blood+ came out back in 2005, it was one of the seasons most anticipated releases. The original work, Blood: The Last Vampire, screamed for a longer storyline that showed some development. And while Blood+ was to take place in a separate universe, if it managed to construct a decent story around the beautiful aesthetics of the film, then we would have had a definite winner. Sadly, Blood+ is, to put it bluntly, a bit of a mess. \r\nBlood+ starts off decent enough. Saya, our protagonist, is revealed to be the only one capable of killing the human killing, blood sucking chiropterans. Early on, abit os a standard \"mysterious past\" is established, although over the course of 50 episodes, it's never explained as well as it probably should have banned. Those hoping for a one woman show, like Blood: The Last Vampire, may also find it interesting that Blood+ sort of becomes a band of travelers movie with Saya's close friends, Riku and Kai, and her guardian of sort, the mysterious cello playing Hagi.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest problems of this show is that so many of its elements are very, very conventional. Saya is an amnesia sufferer who has \"forgotten\" about her past as a bloody killer. The American military is interfering in the role of vampires, which would have made for a decent little conspiracy story, if predictable, if it was fully explored. We are also treated to a bevy of corny \"live your life for today\" speeches from the likes of Saya's friends. It's all very standard fare.\\n\\n\r\nThis wouldn't have been too bad, and would have been saved in part by the decently exciting action, if the series wasn't so arbitrary. New rules and twists are introduced haphazardly to the plot at seemingly unfit times. The Schiff, who are basically manufactured vampires, are tossed into the mix lazily, and their new set of rules and characters pops up and then is sort of left behind as the series progresses. This is how a lot of the second half of the show works. As Saya pursues Diva, the head honcho of the bad guys, all kinds of unexplored sub-plots are layered on; besides the aforementioned Schiff, we have some conflict between Diva's guardians (they're the bad guy equivalent of Hagi, basically), and political dealings with the American military, but they all feel terribly unimportant and underdeveloped, because the show ends up basically becoming one long, protracted chase scene, with Saya desperately trying to locate Diva and defeat her once and for all. This is extended by a relentless number of fight scenes that begin to lose their importance as we realize they are basically just delaying the final showdown.\\n\\n\r\nThe show becomes simultaneously bogged down by the unneeded subplots, as well as too narrow-minded in how it chooses to be \"mysterious\" about all the characters and backgrounds. No, a show needn't spell out everything for the viewer, but we're never really given much to go on, if anything, from Saya, Hagi, and Diva and her cronies. Even as one of the antagonists essentially falls in love with Saya, it all feels very rushed and heavy-handed. While the pacing manages to keep the show watchable, it becomes so repetitive and predictable that it fails to stand out.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending itself is something pretty much any viewer will be able to see from a mile away (and it has to do with another weird arbitrary rule that seems to be heaped on just to attempt to make it sad). Because of this, the emotional punch it is supposed to provide is more like an emotional feather dusting.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some positives, the animation is good, even if it lacks the dark appeal of The Last Vampire. The various world locations we get to see manage to help keep things varied.  Kai becomes an interesting character with a soft-side to go along with his rambunctious one, that we can really empathize with. The action is generally pretty exciting at first. But the show just wears out its welcome with the arbitrary introduction of new ideas and characters that are often abandoned simply to fit the plot. It makes you wonder why they were needed in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, this all leaves Blood+ as a watchable, but simplistic and by-the-numbers vampire flick.\\n\\n\r\n3/10\\n",

            "content": "Blood+ was recommended to me by a friend about five months ago. After being briefed on the basic plotline by her I was less than impressed to say the least, after all, one girl fighting the forces of evil (Or in this case Chiroptera) with her band of merry men, it was an idea done many a time before (Just look at Buffy the Vampire Slayer!) Yet I decided to give it a go regardless. I was delighted to find myself proved wrong however after finishing the anime just a few weeks later. I\u2019ve since re-watched it twice and would definitely recommend it to anyonewith brilliant taste in anime!\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Blood+ is one filled with compelling fight scenes, tension and mystery right until the very final episode. One of the greatest things about this anime is that the storyline constantly has the viewer guessing what will happen next without the plotline becoming predictable. Every small detail links in perfectly with the story, resulting in a perfectly rounded off anime that will delight even those who don\u2019t usually enjoy anime of the vampire genre.\\n\\n\r\nYet another great thing about Blood+ is the amazing cast of characters. Unlike some anime (Not mentioning any names here!) the characters actually have development, and a lot of it at that! As you progress through the show the characters will undergo some kind of hardship or test and blossom before your very eyes as a result of it, making them real easy to get attached to! The interactions between the different characters are ingenious and not always lacking in humour despite the dark tone of the anime! Not only do the characters develop themselves but develop their relationships with the other characters as well! Saya, the main character herself is interesting, adorably naive and fairly easy to relate to, which can rarely be said for the main hero/heroine of a genre such as this so I feel as though this is a real achievement!\\n\\n\r\nOut of the many anime I\u2019ve seen in my time Blood+ has one of the most unique animation styles out there! The characters are interesting to look at and well in proportion throughout the entire series. Not once did I glance at a character and think, hang on a minute! I swear he had a larger nose in that last shot! The backgrounds are beautifully laid out and detailed and the shading is done at the level of a pro! Perfection!\\n\\n\r\nEven the music is perfect! The underlining score fits in well with the sad and dark tone of the anime, sometimes all it took for me to start balling like a baby at a sad scene was for this particular theme to start playing softly in the background. So yeah, the music just adds to the brilliance of this amazing anime! The OP/Ed themes were pretty much flawless as well! Okay, admittedly I preferred some more than other but everyone is entitled to their own opinion, right?\\n\\n\r\nSo Perhaps one of my favourite things about the show Blood+ is that despite it being an anime chock-a-bloc with deep, meaningful life lessons it never becomes too cheesy. I myself don\u2019t seem to recall any big emotional speeches on the power of friendship, or believing in oneself which to be honest is a welcome relief! Despite the story-line having a fair amount of plot-twists and unexpected happenings the anime never becomes too complicated either, as I was soon to learn, everything happens for a reason!\\n\\n\r\nSo that\u2019s that then! Now you know of the wonder that is Blood+ At least, I hope you do, this is my first review you see so I hope I\u2019ve done the show some ruddy justice! It\u2019s the least it deserves for keeping me entertained and on the edge of my seat for three damn weeks! So go watch it already, I promise you won\u2019t be disappointed! \\n",

            "content": "Blood+ was truly an interesting anime - it requires patience but once one starts to get accustomed with the pace and characters, it is an amazing anime.\r\nStory wise Blood+ starts slow. It takes time to develop, to let the elements of the story, for the characters to interact naturally rather than forcing them into a swirling bog to just push the story ahead. And it starts with the basic anime form: The basic elements are put forth - Chiropteran and Saya. One can assume that with the progression of stronger foes and conflicting feelings, there is nothing more to the anime than the main characterwho is initially weak growing stronger to face all foes.\\n\\n\r\nHowever as the story progresses one finds out that it is not so. There will be additional elements which do not appear as a new boss might when the previous one dies. They actually develop a very intricate plot. And it's approach is slow. It takes four  to five episodes to let the character figure his/her own weakness and then stabilize as they would in a real world scenario. Claymore on the other hand (ignoring how its story progresses) manages to do all that in the first episode. Gantz takes up to three episodes for that.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this progression initially feels slow in contrast to animes like Mirai Nikki or Sword Art Online it becomes a positive because unnecessary character development and huge increments in power is avoided and there is time for small plot details to be handled. The story starts taking proper shape around the tenth episode and for a fifty episode anime that isn't too slow. There are various side stories and endeavors that combine together and connect (sometimes too big a coincidence) and keep the viewer up to date with all the characters. It is also a clever way of telling parts of the story from another perspective.\\n\\n\r\nSo all in all it has a very complex and well thought story and yes - if I want I can sit down and find faults like \"did they close the gate or not\" but it is a good thing that in the entire anime such frivolous events are taken for granted. Meaning thinking about the guards changing shift is not our business.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style isn't that bad for its time. The backgrounds are good and at times rather beautiful in terms of vibrant colors in contrast to dull underground moments. There isn't a fixed atmosphere, one will be able to see light slice of life like moments and one will see bloody sequences. And neither feel out of place.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are mixed - Saya and Haji and Solomon (regardless of his stereotypical prince look) are drawn well - they have their physical traits that show detail in their art work. However there are a few characters (Kai for instance) that just seem like a few lines under a scruff of hair at times. It isn't that distracting but at times I feel Kai lose expressions or originality other than his hair. However this is being critical - the characters are more or less consistent with real-life proportions and we have one piece as well in which some character faces are very basic (ignoring the unrealistic proportions they at times have).\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks in Blood+ Mostly left a positive impression on me - they had a nice gist to them and they were timed well. Emotions and scenario's are well expressed through suitable sound tracks. Fighting sequences were well complimented and so were the slice of life moments - much like the art they managed both sides well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was a big positive for me in this anime. Yes, we do have the hero that at times is swayed and needs memories and friends n family to go through tough times but there is quite some work put in the development of different characters - some subtle characteristics that one notices afterwards and also traits that make them less predictable in the anime realm.\\n\\n\r\nSaya - as an instance did portray the typical shounen main hero (Ichigo for example) in which they are people who preach justice all the time and are against fighting (a better example would be Yuuto from Omamori Himari) however as the story progresses she gets stronger and mentally more mature and sees the situation from a different light - something that doesn't happen in a day or so.\\n\\n\r\nKai, as much as I find his art style in the start not too good - is a good character, impulsive and daring however he isn't the guy you would always expect to go haywire due to his personality, who butts into everything for the sake of protecting everyone. Wow... that kind of reminds me of Kato in Gantz... although he was also properly crafted, a little less multi faceted as he was.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment wise it will take the anime about ten episodes to kick in - but then the believable characters, the complex plot, all of these elements combine to give what I'd say is one of the best animes I have seen. It is well balanced - not diving into a world of needless action, nor is it slow enough to bore you.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading and feedback is always appreciated.",

            "content": "Story: Any vampire fans would appreciate the story; the ever-reusable (and reused) vampire legend gets a new spin here. From the very first episode, the main character Saya is unwittingly thrown into a fight for humanity that only she can put an end to. Accompanied by her (sexy) cellist guardian who has some link to her, she sets out to rid the world of the vampire-like chiropterans plaguing the earth. Fortunately for us, the story is quite a bit more complex than that. Very soon into the series, the story becomes deeper, with many twists revealed about Saya and her dark past. \r\nArt: From whatI have seen, this has a very unique art style, especially in that all the characters actually look unique. I'm referring to many other series where the characters all look ridiculously similar since they were designed by the same person. Also, the show has a decidedly dark atmosphere which is wonderfully presented in the animation. If you are a fan of much blood, also take comfort in knowing you'll find a lot here. It is in the title, after all.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Personally I'm not a fan of any of the opening or closing themes, but the soundtrack is one of my favorites from any anime. Mark Mancina composed the score for Blood+ (turning him into an anime fan in the process) and was helped by Hans Zimmer, so it's the first anime I've seen where the music was written by someone not actually Japanese. Mancina's rich score is perfect for the show. The voice actors did wonderfully as well. Noteworthy is Kari Wahlgren as Saya (though I didn't approve of using her for Diva, too, whom she rather botched) and Crispin Freeman as Haji (for some reason, the mysterious and seemingly emotionless characters suit him). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Character development is great here, thanks mostly to Saya, who must grow from the timid amnesiac she begins the show as to a strong female warrior, and it is interesting to watch how this transformation really takes a toll on her personality. The other supporting characters also help contribute to the character development, to a certain extent. After my own heart, the show's creators let the audience in on the villain's side many times, allowing us to see their plans before the other characters do. Hooray for dramatic irony and moving forward of plotlines!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: As I mentioned earlier, vampire fans who are sick of the &quot;same ol&rsquo;, same ol&rsquo;&quot; vampire stories will love this one. Really, the only similarity between &quot;traditional&quot; vampires and the ones in Blood+ are that they drink blood. Speaking of blood, if you are squeamish at the sight of cartoon blood, keep away from this for obvious reasons, as it would inhibit your enjoyment of the series tremendously. Anyone else would like Blood+ since it has a good amount of action, but doesn't deviate from the main plotline, which is surprisingly complex. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Unless you don't like really violent anime, I would recommend this to anyone who likes vampires, action, drama, romance, and a good plot. And sexy cellists.\\n",

The beginning was extremely interesting, but after a while, it just got kinda boring, and in the end, I felt as if I had wasted a lot of my time. It could have ended a lot earlier instead of making it 50 episodes.\r\nThe emphasis is more on the characters than the action, and all the fights are pretty much the same. Nothing that would really amaze me. This would have been alright ifit weren't for the fact that most of the characters were just annoying. I really couldn't stand Kai, especially considering how his relationship with Mao turned out. Saya was still unlikeable even after she seemed to have matured after the one year time skip. I really didn't enjoy Blood+. It had an interesting story, but it was brought down by poor execution and direction.",

            "content": "When I saw about 15 episodes of Blood+, a friend asked me how was it. I said it was boring and dull, with some nice fighting scenes once in a while. After another 10-15 episodes, another friend asked me for my opinion on Blood+. I said it was one of the best anime series I saw this year. How do I feel after finishing the whole 50 chapters? Lets start from the beginning. \r\nBlood+ revolves around a story of a \"young\" girl who is the only person on the planet able to fight vampire-like monsters, called Chiropterans, and wants to find out about her troubledpast. But my biggest &quot;wow&quot; is not going to the plot (which sounds a little familiar to all of us). I have two big &quot;wows,&quot; actually. One is for graphics and one is for sound. Beautifully pictured landscapes across the world, pleasant characters and intense, realistic fight scenes will give your eyes a definite present. And what better way to complete this piece of art than adding an elegant soundtrack (Haji playing J.S. Bach on his cello is now in my top 10 anime moments ever) which polishes the sophistication and intelligence of this series. These are the things that keep you loyal to Blood+ and gives you a feeling that it is not an ordinary story. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, we have to be fair and talk a little about the downside of this series. Firstly, even if the story sounds kind of old, it is actually very complicated at times. You have to follow the conspiracies behind politics, the stories of Saya and other main characters, understand the importance of some individuals who don't really look important and so on. At one point I have to confess, I was tired of listening to story lines about Red Shield and Cinq Fleches organizations and all the problems they had when I just knew it was all about Saya, she is the one who can end this and she should be the main point of discussion. Therefore, prepare yourself for long conversations that could sometimes seem meaningless and if you are an &quot;action guy/girl&quot; you could be a bit disappointed. \\n\\n\r\n So, what is my final judgment? Well, I said to myself earlier in the series that the ending will probably decide the true quality of Blood+. However, although it wasn't as predictable as I thought it would be, I can't say that it left me unsatisfied. Actually, for some reason, I felt that I respect this anime series even more than I did in the beginning (especially after I saw the movie that this series evolved from, yuck). Do I recommend Blood+? Absolutely. There will be at least few moments when you will adore the characters and enjoy the story that we sometimes fantasize of being a part of. \\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S. IF YOU DID NOT WATCHED BLOOD+ YET, DO NOT READ THIS! \\n\r\nA part of me is still screaming for an ending where Saya falls asleep at the last moment of the fight against Diva, leaving the world domination to the Chiropterans. Then waking up 30 years from that fight, reuniting with Haji and trying to clean up the twisted future from these monsters. Now, tell me, it is not your ideal ending! And what a sequel it would be! The studios should definitely let the fans of anime create endings sometimes.",

            "content": "A girl on to fight against monsters, a secret organisation and powerful enemies! If you want to enjoy an anime with a dark tune, complex story and really great charakter development, Blood+ would be a good choice! But beware if you get too close to certain charakters, your heart might get broken!\r\nIf you are looking for a fun and happy anime series, don't watch it. As I said before the anime is rather dark and as the name says bloody. There are some scenes that can be considered cruel (not only in a physical way).\r\nAnd one more warning, before the praise: If you're expecting tonsof action filled scenes, there will be some, but not as many as you might expect. Don't watch it if you get easily bored if there is no fight every five minutes. \\n\\n\r\nVery short summary: Saya needs to fight vampirelike creatures called Chiropteran, only she can kill. At her side are her friends, that support her and whom she wishes to protect. Her enemies on the other hand wish to create a world filled with Chiropterans and try to persuade Saya, that she should support them.\\n\\n\r\nOf course there is as usual a good side and a bad side. However Sayas enemies are not all pictured pure evil. There is no absolute black and white sight. Neither is Saya pictured as a flawless heroine. At some point you might even find yourself to be a little repelled.\\n\r\nThere are many episodes that follow a rather slow tune and can look like filler episodes at first glance. I still enjoyed them, because they showed how the characters changed as a response to all the traumatic things happening to them. It makes them all the more believable and helped me to get attached to them.\\n\\n\r\nI watched Blood+ two times now. The first time I was much younger than now. The second time I found myself beeing drawn to different characters than the first time. So this might be a sign that there is someone to like for younger and older people ;)\\n\\n\r\nAnd last but not least, soundtrack and art are amazing! It fits the scenes very well and manages greatly to draw you in! \\n\\n\r\nI hope this was helpful to you! Enjoy watching!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The story only gets better as the anime goes on, and the characters are all entrancing.  It is not your normal vampire anime, but has a very unique view and intriguing plot that is believable.  The only problem may be the English version of the anime.  I find the voice actors completely off par with the Japanese voice actors, though I feel this way about most : )  The music is alsoamazing, with some great j-rock songs and an amazing song sung by the character Diva.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes darker, more serious anime with just enough humor that the drama is not overbearing.",

It is one anime that has supernatural features, slight parts of romance, and even some historical event correlation intertwined in this fictional world that has the inhabitants called chiropterans; bat-like creatures that feast on human blood. I, myself am not one who favors all gore and blood soaked scenes, but the story in Blood+ really captivates me. The bloody fight scenes all connect to the main plot and is not one excessive blood fest. Plus, this anime isone of those shows that gets you &quot;hooked&quot; and makes you think strategically and use problem-solving to sort of determine what is what and how things work. \\n\\n\r\nNow getting to the characters, they are wonderfully drawn and thought out, each with their own obvious personality. Even with the side-characters, they all equally stand out and none are really overshadowed. It isn't one of those animes that add filler characters to let the story drag on and what not. Once characters are drawn in Blood+, they are kept and have their own scene time throughout the whole thing (meaning Saya is not the center of all the attention).\\n\\n\r\nOne downfall to the characters are their character development. Most of the time, they hold rare emotional view points and don't develop quite as fast. When watching, one usually feels a part of the anime (if it's a really good one), but the characters perceived by myself are somewhat 2-D and impersonal. Other than that, this anime is of course a great one that should be on everyone's watched/will watch list and even though I am not even finished with it yet, I am most definitely impressed with high standards and cannot believe how I missed watching such an excellent anime.\\n",

Once I got started, I could hardly stop.\r\nIt is interesting to see the change the main character goes through, and it is a very interesting relationship she had to people around her.\r\nAt first, the story may seem confusing, but of course it all comes together as you get more and more into the story. You don't know more than Saya, which makes it easy to get as frustarated as her, making you want to find out which again makes you hang on to it.\r\nI wasn't too impressed with the artwork, but it can be nice not to always look at the shiny,wild colored hair and eyes.\\n\r\nAs it isn't really a comical anime, it does contain comedy, but none of the well-known extreme anime drawings with chibi figures. This makes the story more &quot;serious&quot;, and is certainly a plus!\\n\r\nThe art isn't too detailed though, and it's nothing spectacular, but definitely NOT bad! Depends on preferance.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good, and it's impressing how different the tracks are made, though it's based on the same three or four melodies. Very well composed.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very deep, and you can sort of predict how they will react to different situations as yo get to know them. Tthe chracters are also very different, and all in all well made.\\n\\n\r\nIt has a good length - doesn't get boring or drawn out. Once you finish the anime, it makes you sad because you really want it to continue!\\n\r\nIt also has an open ending, making YOU the boss of what is going to happen in the future, which is very nice.\\n\\n\r\nI can ONLY recommend this anime; both if you're a guy or a girl, into romance or action - it really has it all. An anime I couldn't get my eyes off once I got started!",

The characters are all lovable, even the villains, and the way the story slowly reveals itself just makes you keep wanting more. I kept finding myself watching episode after episode into the wee hours in the morning, telling myself I'd just watch one more, but watching another after that and another after that. And the ending? Many things happened that I didn't expect, I was left pleasantly surprised. I was very happy withthe ending, and the entire anime overall. I highly recommend this anime, as long as you don't mind some (a lot of) animated blood.",

            "content": "Can't be denied, the anime produced by Aniplex is always interesting and inspiring like Gintama or Fate / Zero.\r\nBlood + is also the production of flavors and Aniplex has its own story where the anime is the theme of vampires in a different package, generally described the figure of handsome vampire or a mysterious figure, but Blood + presents a different case in which the vampire portrayed beautiful women and strong\r\nThe story that took place in various countries presents a different atmosphere where spectators are invited adventure with Blood +.\r\nBasically this anime is a story about a protagonist Otonashi memory loss in the past andthe journey he was accompanied by Haji (Chaveliar) to find the fragments of memory in the past and reveal who he really is and why he must fight against Chiropetra. There are so many conflicts and emotions happen in this anime, especially Kai's brother who is a regular guy who tried to protect Otonashi and Riku, but in the end he had to lose Riku Otonashi but managed to bring home with great happiness.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10\\n\r\nThe story is presented is too simple and predictable. Only centered on the pursuit Otonashi Diva to kill him and end the story of his adventures. Due to the anime just centered on one character alone that the author forgot to develop the leaders began to seem monotonous and a half episode proved very slow and centered on the same thing.\\n\r\nBut I appreciate the creativity of the author in which he presents the background of a different vampire. Not only that drama, the bond of brotherhood, friendship seems so strong and proven where Kai which is a sister of Otonashi are not bound by blood relations regard it as his own brother, a friendship between man and Sif Chevaliar too strong.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nPicture of this anime seems so ordinary, nothing interesting is evident from home in Japan and various countries. But what impressed me was the city where the author can draw in countries such detail shown on the outskirts of the Vietnam looks exactly the atmosphere there, Russia and the surrounding city look so cool and modern American impressed. Not only is it a pretty good picture of Chiropetra\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nDo not really remember the Sound of this anime, because he had not seen it. But by giving a score of 7 is enough for recall soundtrack and sound so good at fighting and thrilling moments is quite fitting\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nThis is where the value of this anime, talk about the character means to talk about social relations and psychology. Character of this anime was so strong and there is no proven falsity of the story and from 1 until the end of the character of the anime is growing and convincing.\\n\r\nGeorge: where he managed to portray a father, how he educated his children, giving courage and most importantly how to live in the world when it is clear they are not the biological child.\\n\r\nOtonashi, I: at first he was so cheerful and happy look on every day but when the adventures of the character began to change more mature and intelligent attention of those around proven Solomon fell in love with him but he's still just a pity he felt this was an introvert in which all the mistakes and the like solve their own problems when people around him continue to support it\\n\r\nKai: an older brother had played a character with both arguably even close to perfect as a figure of a boy. Evidently, where he continued to accompany her sister Otonashi which is continuing to support wherever and whenever the end of a long hibernation. An inspiration to friends around him, especially the Sif\\n\r\nHajj: the mysterious figure's loyal and who successfully brought by Haji. He not only serves Otonashi but because of his love he could grant all hope of Otonashi. But the remarkable here is that even though he's loyal servant and Otonashi proven he's not stupid at the end of the episode where Otonashi Haji wants to die but not granted and advised to continue to live and smile every day.\\n\r\nThere are so many valuable lessons in this anime is the time in which to solve puzzles and fishing character gives advice on how to resolve the issue wisely and meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nThis is what makes the time a little disappointed of this anime, the story is slow and continues to focus on one story with a character until the middle of the last episode makes the writer feel uncomfortable and want to decide to stop this anime. But in mid-last episode of this anime started to find his way and completely comfortable watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOveral 35/5: 7\\n\r\nYes, that's enough value for the anime, as the authors assess the terms of the story so that it is sufficient for the anime horror genre Action",

This young girl whose name is Saya is no ordinary girl because she is the only person in the world who can fight against Chiropterans, which are monsters that feed on blood of living humans and can look like humanswhen they want. \\n\r\nThere are alot of twists and turn which make the story really good\\n\\n\r\nArt : 10\\n\r\n The animation was really good for its time and Charcters looked really good. The fighting scenes are really animated well especially when Saya fights with her sword or when her servant Haji fights.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe sound goes well with the show. the music most of the time fits the scene well. It has a nice dark tone to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharcters: 10\\n\r\nWhats kool about blood + is that they have great protagnists and atagonists. The bad guys really get good character development and so Does Saya and her freinds.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the series more than I thought I would. I watched 12 episodes on adult swim network long time ago and never came back to  it I kept putting it off thinking it probally won't be that good of a series but I was wrong it easily became one the better anime series I have watched in a long time. There are some boring episodes thrown in everyone once in a while so thats why i gave it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10\\n\r\nIf you see my anime list you can see i give really good scores usally 10s to alot of the series I have watched. Basically if enjoyed the series it is going to get a 9 or 10 from me. Blood + is something that every anime fan can enjoy because it has alot of drama and alot action to keep your attention.",

The anime is set throughout different locations and time periods in history and is based on real world events. The core of the show is about vampires, but with an evolutionary twist to it. It follows a young girl called Saya (a protagonist that is actually likable) that soon discovers she's not who she thinks she is and what she is. It's definitely an anime I'd recommend to anyone and has a GREAT soundtrack too. Oh and I highly recommend that you get some tissues prepared, as it has its Romeo and Juliet moments:)\\n",

I always find myself a little disappointed at those synopsis because they only tell what happens in the first episode and Blood+ is so much more than that. Very amazing story they've created in this anime, it keeps you hooked!\r\nThe animation is also very nice, unique, but still lovable. The character designs areso good as well! You can't watch this series and not find a character to love, and as for me, there are many! \\n\r\nThe music is amazing as well, and I didn't expect anything less than the best from Hans Zimmer and Mark Mancina. The music for this show is beautiful, the slower one's can make you feel very sad and the faster one's make you feel like you're fighting Chiropterans right along Saya! I love when music can have such effects on me. And I didn't forget about the awesome opening and endings songs, I love all of them, they're very fitting to the show. \\n\r\nSo overall, this anime is AMAZING, the best thing I have and ever will watch. I highly reccomend watching it, it has something for everyone! This anime will not let you down, that I promise you.",

            "content": "Got some time? didnt care much for blood the last vampire? well come on in~\r\nlike most of you guys, i first saw this on adult swim while waiting for my weekly dose of shounen; i landed on an unpolished gem. story starts slow ill admit.. real slow. however if you can get past that, you will be rewarded with an adventure. story revolves around a girl named saya and her adventures to kill off the vampire kind;generic enough for you yet? well saya is one of the two \"pure bred\" vampire queens in the story, other being her twin sister diva. In the end, withthe misunderstanding of one, saya makes it her duty to hunt down diva and her chevaliers (knights). i wont give out too much information, but if you are into semi historical, betrayal, and a large scale adventure.. this might be for you, however if you are into 44 mins of mindless gore like blood the last vampire, look elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nThing that i really liked about this show is the art, not much to say except that everything is drawn exceptionally, the outfits, background, and the battle scenes are top tier. the drawings of the \"vampire\"s are also very well done to the point that it can be somtimes disgusting ( they do however tone down the gore compared to blood the last vampire). ***THE OP ART IS TOP OF THE LINE***\\n\\n\r\nOP//ED//VA are all supurb 10/10. the only thing truly stopped me from dropping this show during ep 1-13 was the op but mostly ED Kataritsugu koto which i look foward to every time.  i really liked the fact that they used different voice actors for saya and diva, giving them a distinguishable voice ( you american dubbers learn from this) yet still show some similarity. \\n\\n\r\nok.. lets talk about some of the downsides and upsides of the characters. The good part of the charactes is that the main characters feel.. somewhat balenced if not underpowered which is alot considering most of todays shows have a lvl 9001 protagonist killing billions of enemies. as someone previous from this review said: they feel alive, as if you can meet them if u headed to okinawa. Now the bad part.. i personally feel as if they added too many \"unnecessary\" characters which in the end didnt help with the flow of the story at all. i was so annoyed with the camera guy and his mafia princess because of the amount of screentime they had. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment... this is hard to say. im not going to defend its early episodes, because id be fighting a losing battle.. however, if you can survive through the early parts, the story later on will suck you in and keep u there till the very end. unlike most other shows, i can say that the ending to blood+ was satisfactory and very open to people whom want to decide whom and who is still alive etc.\\n\\n\r\n9-10-10-8-8\\n\r\nshould average to 9! why was the overall score an 8?\\n\r\nsimple, rewatch value is very low (non existant in the early episodes) because of the fact that it isnt rocket science. the story made sense the 1st time and therefore no reason to watch it again. its a good show, and if you have the time to kill 50 episodes, id reccomend it to anyone who likes a good story, but if you were misguided here due to this being a \"sequel\" to blood the last vampire, the X button is to the top right",

If I had to pick a favorite part of Blood+ I think it would be the story. I love when a show has a story that takes a lot of episodes to play out, but doesn't ever loose focus. This is what Blood+ does best. The concept is fairly simple but there are many complexities that you discover as the show progresses.  \r\nArt 8/10\r\nFor an anime made in 2006 this show is on parwith what you would expect. By the standards set by more recent shows it is nothing special, but it still good. The characters are well depicted and I have nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very well done. It is produced by Mark Mancina/Hans Zimmer and if you are familiar with any of their work then you know what to expect. The opening and ending songs are fantastic. I especially love the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th openings. The 3rd opening is one of my all time favorites. The 4th is done by Jinn. Some people can't stand the vocals of Jinn but I came to enjoy them (Jinn is the same artist that performed the second Code Geass OP).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI thought the characters of Blood+ where very good. There is lots of good character development. At times I wished Saya would access more of her badass potential but I can't complain about her overall.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThere were some parts that were a little slow but not many, overall I enjoyed Blood+ very much\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 - Highly recommended",

            "content": "\"It is beyond blood. I have formed a bond with you sweeter and stronger than Blood.\" - Solomon\r\nBlood+ is an interesting anime- not because it's particularly innovative or groundbreaking in its field, but precisely because it does what it does well, and doesn't fall victim to mistakes and tropes that many other shonen fantasy anime have, and continue to do. The premise is a twist on vampire fiction- taking many points from classic bloodsucking media, and yet giving it an anime spin, mixing the two in an enjoyable way that doesn't rip the fabric of the fiction. \r\nArtwork and Animation: 7\r\nProduction IG produced Blood+ startingin fall of 2005, running for a full year. The visual style is rather reminiscent of the then-newly ending series Ghost in the Shell SAC 2nd- the character models, faces, hair and particularly the scenery look very similar. One thing this anime does have going for it in the visual department is a large amount of costume and locale changes. This might sound small- but watching the same nameless streets in downtown Tokyo for 9 hours would have been really grating. \\n\\n\r\nBlood+ keeps it fresh by travelling across the world, including Japan, Vietnam, Siberia, French wine country + Paris, London, New York, and a few other locations- always with famous landmarks to let the viewer in on it. On the whole, the animation is fairly average- certainly a product of the time, but very watchable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is decent at best, and wooden at worst. Christopher Nissley as David sounds wholly uninterested and bored the entire show. Maybe it's that his character is the stoic tough guy, but even in rare moments of vulnerability, he's still the same pinewood 2X4 that he was to begin with. Kari Wahlgren of Fate/ (as the Saber) fame stars as Saya- to my surprise. She sounds entirely different in Blood+ than she does now in Fate. 10 years of aging has changed her voice a lot, but she anchors the cast fairly well regardless. \\n\\n\r\nCrispin Freeman (Kirei Kotomine, Fate) deserves an award for this show- having voiced 3 main characters, and so effectively doing so that it was not noticeable! He's most prominent as Haji, the silent and strong companion of Saya, and he affects a passable French accent for Van Argiano. Rounding out the trio, he also uses rather young sounding but commanding voice for Joel Goldschmidt, as well as voicing other unimportant one off characters and background voices. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in Blood+ is beautiful as well- featuring opera, a few classic symphonic tunes, and a lot of cello- typically featured when the character Haji plays- but also used in tense and dramatic moments. The music was very effective at eliciting the right emotional feel at the right time, and never felt overbearing. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and Story: 8\\n\\n\r\nGiven that this anime spans 50 episodes, there are a lot of characters introduced- 10 just on the protagonist Saya's side of the conflict, and nearly the same on the other. This is not the place to list them all or their inner conflicts, but suffice to say that everyone of importance receives their appropriate due of characterization- though the story is the journey of Saya. The character motivations are fairly logically driven, and the concept of loyalty, loyalty that goes beyond blood is a defining theme throughout the story. \\n\r\nIt's also interesting to see how the conflict of the show grows from a tiny microcosm at the beginning, to a world spanning conflict- though it never feels overwhelming. The conflict itself also changes from a journey of exploration to petty revenge, to redemption, and eventually to acceptance.\\n\\n\r\nBlood+ does have pacing issues, however. New goals or new villains are introduced in the beginning, particularly, with no explanation at all in the prior episode, leaving the viewer feeling like as though they skipped an episode. There were two moments I can remember where I actually did go back to the last episode for a little recap just because it was such a jarring shift. These issues largely clear up after the first cour (13 episodes) ends- so it's a bit of a trial period, but it's very worth it to see how it all comes together.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also does a very good job of making immortal and near immortal enemies very difficult to kill without devolving into Team Rocket blasting off again\u2122, or the classic \"I'll get you next time!\" by the mustachio-twirling villain. The humans really are nearly powerless to stop the chiropterans- and it stays that way throughout. The Chevaliers, or vampires made from the blood of Saya, or her sister Diva, can only be killed with the blood of one of the two- and this point is proven over and over again. Several times throughout the show, the characters will stop fighting solely because they recognize and say to each other that it's pointless to fight as they cannot kill each other. \\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to my next point about attention to detail- the show is full of it. Small details and what seem like offhand comments about abilities or weaknesses are stuck to, to the letter. What seem like plot holes are filled in very carefully with details from previous episodes or findings- very little-to-no deus ex machina here. \\n\\n\\n\r\nDrawing from the earlier comment about vampire fiction- there are several different groups and types of vampires in the show- each with a different facet of the accepted \"vampire powers\". Some can't be exposed to the sun, some have incredible speed or hypnosis powers. The base chiropterans themselves are a reference to the order that bats belong to: Chiroptera. Many of the beasts have long, ratlike snouts and webbed, winged arms. They all require blood, though- and that's what makes the show go round. Blood ties all.\\n\\n\r\nLastly- the way the story is handled is a very mature and dramatic way, for a shonen. There are moments of real tragedy and gravitas in there- and a couple of truly horrifying moments that continue to serve up grimaces long after the event, once it's revealed what actually happened. This is a show that's not afraid to kill off main characters- and even requires it of the plot. There are a few genuinely sad and touching moments- a rarity in what could otherwise just have been a mind numbing action fest.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 7\\n\\n\r\nI was pleasantly surprised with Blood+. I typically shy away from long running series; even one that clocks in at 50 episodes, but I have to hand it to them- I remained engaged, interested, and wanting to see what happens next (in part thanks to the cliffhangers). The only thing that really threw me off was the really poor pacing in the first third of the show, but aside from that, a solid watch. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nBonus: The Blood+ Drinking Game, by LawlMartz\\n\\n\r\nLick a shot when:\\n\\n\r\n1) There's a closeup cut to Haji's face and he says \"Saya\" in a sensuous, hushed whisper\\n\\n\r\n2) A flashback occurs\\n\\n\\n\r\nTake a sip when: \\n\\n\r\n3) A chiropteran transforms onscreen\\n\\n\r\n4) Someone mentions Vietnam\\n\\n\r\n5) Louis is eating something\\n\\n\r\n6) Mao gets bitchy\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinish your drink when: \\n\\n\r\n7) A Chevalier or important character dies\\n\\n\\n\r\nDon't be afraid to drop me a comment and all that, and as always- come rage at me.",

Though since the small meeting of her and a man named Haji, her life has never been the same.\r\nThe story was wonderful. There were plenty of twists, and sudden turns that just turned out so well put. With every new small plot that leads up to the main plot, there were lots of things that happened, and with all those things, it made the story complete.\r\nThe art was okay. At first, it was great, but as the series progressed, it slowly gets worse. The sounds was just about the same. Sometimes you would realizethat the suspense isn't quite what it could be, and the background music didn't help with that at it's full potential. The characters were amazing. They all had a story of their own, they all look far different from the other characters, and all had a personality of their own. I enjoyed this series a lot. I wish that it would go on, but it is already a very long series. Overall its great, and I highly recommend it.",

            "content": "Did you want more of the Vietnam era paranoid vampire film Blood?\r\nWell, here it is. Creatively titled Blood+, the show seems to disavow the \"last vampire\" claim. Because Saya isn't the \"last vampire.\" Notwithstanding the plot holes of the movie in which she wasn't the \"last vampire\" either...\r\nWhatever.\r\nThis is a 50 episode tour de force that tries to really do everything at once.\r\nSo, Saya. She's a vampire, or rather something called Chiroptera (it's a generic name for all bat like critters, but for the english subs it's what Vampires are in the show). She has several unusual characteristics. She's dormant for most of her life,awakening only to mate or kick ass. \\n\\n\r\nBut she is more of a solitary, withdrawn creature and prefers just to kick ass when the US military (who happen to \"own\" her at the time) choose to use her. Apparently they tried to awaken her when she wasn't ready in 'Nam and she went batshit crazy. Somehow her care was then entrusted to a guy called David--whose special forces squad she massacred.\\n\\n\r\nFast forward to the present or near future, and Saya is living in Okinawa with David and two of David's adopted sons, Kai and Riku. She has no knowledge of being a vampire thing until an incident at school \"awakens\" her.\\n\\n\r\nApparently Saya is a queen of a species that has a complex life cycle not unlike bees where queens spawn male drones and have sterile workers/soldiers. This entire concept has been exploited by various organizations. But in short, there are generic drones (the usual ugly primitive vampire brutes that act like the usual fodder for mass slaugther) then there are chevaliers, sort of like male bees--their job being protecting a queen and mating with her twin to propagate the species. Artificially created chevaliers fit somewhere into all of this, too.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is where it begins: a story that encompasses several timelines, involves over a dozen key characters, and another dozen or so supporting ones and keeps unraveling in complexity. The problem is that when it makes transitions, it does so abruptly and makes for poor continuity (especially seen with flashbacks, advancing time, etc.)\\n\\n\r\nThere's Saya's past--a strange zoo where she was raised along with her sister Diva and their chevaliers at the hand of a kind man she saw as a kindly father, but apparently had different interests in her twin. There's the several \"present\" storylines where an unaging Saya and her gypsy chevalier Haji find out more and more about their past and Diva, as the other characters age and grow up and interact with Diva's chevaliers and creatures artificially made as Chrioptera research by mysterious government organizations.\\n\\n\r\nHer present tries to tie all of this together, and implies as Saya has been sleeping events that began at the zoo continue to transpire and as time wears on, she becomes more and more aware of the chiropteran/Diva threat that the seed of which was planted at the zoo.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this is rather complex and results in several plot holes, continuity errors, and duplicated characters which makes the anime very clumsy. There's too much going on, the show is trying to accomplish too many things at once before it chooses a direction and starts to prune everyone off as it approaches the end.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, Diva is an unexpectedly complex character whose superficial cruelty and barbarism hide a rather genuine and troubled soul. Her devlopment, from just a stock antagonist is one of the pleasantly suprising elements of the anime.  The problem is that Saya is not a very well developed character, despite being the lead. She seems weak and unmotivated, eternally tired and hurt, constantly being dragged along by the other characters--a premise that gets old. Even the eventual realization that she is this way because she's murdering her own kind (kinda obvious) it doesn't excuse for her rather simplistic and one-dimensional characterization.\\n\\n\r\nDiva has the luxury of being persecuted, wronged, wanting to be loved, hating humanity, not understanding herself... all of which make her fascinating, and yet, ironically, is one of the less developed characters. Saya just seems flat, and too much of the attention is focused on her brooding.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the issue of Diva's chevaliers... most of them are similar, and the arcs where Saya hunts them down are rather redundant. Red Shield makes their own chevaliers--and they're mostly also redundant. There's so much filler that it takes away from what is otherwise a decent story and makes this tiresome instead of a pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nTrimming many of the story arcs and characters, and developing a few more would have made this show shine. But as it is, it's just a well executed, but otherwise average anime.",

            "content": "Way back in October I talked about the anime, Blood-C. In that review I briefly touched on my feelings towards its predecessor, Blood+. Well, apparently that snippet caused some curiosity and I got a request to review it. Blood+ was inspired by a film, Blood: The last Vampire. Now, I can't really tell you what I thought of that film since I've never seen it. This anime, from Production I.G, the same company that produced the film by the way, was my introduction to the series. Now, it has been a while since I watched this, so, because I care about giving you all themost informed opinion possible, I'm going to re-watch the entire thing for review purposes. Let's take a look at Blood+.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty basic. There's a girl named Saya who gets attacked by a blood drinking monster. She's rescued by a mysterious stranger named Haji who gives her a sword and feeds her his blood. This causes something to awaken within her that she doesn't understand. The first half of the story follows Saya's quest to learn about her power and her past. The second half is about her previously forgotten mission. Sorry for being vague but, as usual, I'm trying to refrain from spoiling anything. One thing I do like about Blood+ is the pacing. It gives you enough time to acclimate to the characters and circumstances while keeping things moving at a good pace. There's very little that feels superfluous or like it drags. That being said, there are some unnecessary flashbacks that really only serve to go over information you already know or that they've already given you huge hints about. To be fair, most of the flashbacks are used to hint at information they haven't revealed yet and may, arguably, work but there are some that do act to the detriment of the series since you already know what happened or have a really good idea from the not so subtle hints they like to drop. One major issue I have with the story is at the very end. I won't go into details but there's a complete deus ex moment. They try to justify it through exposition after it happens but it really doesn't work since it comes out of nowhere. Which is odd coming from a series that likes to repeat important plot points and give lots of hints before they happen. \\n\\n\r\nMy major issues with Blood+ come from the characters. I've mentioned this before, but Saya annoys me. She spends virtually the entire series being mopey and depressed even when her immediate circumstances are pretty happy. She's even kind of mopey before her circumstances start to get tragic. Admittedly, she does go through a lot of pain and heartache but it doesn't make for an interesting protagonist when she's perpetually gloomy. It might work in a twelve or thirteen episode anime, but it gets really grating when you have to deal with it for fifty episodes. The antagonists aren't any better. Most of them have really lazy motivations like just being jerks or being complete nutters. There is one antagonistic character who moves beyond that but he's typical in a different way. I don't want to spoil anything, but let's say he's a chivalrous gentleman. The main antagonist is the worst. She starts out fine with a backstory that gives her the potential to be a sympathetic character, but then she gets one of those turning irredeemably evil scenes. They try to pull away from that towards the end and make her sympathetic, but it doesn't work since the method they use is really stupid and she's already pole vaulted over the point of no return. Frankly, trying to make her sympathetic after that is pretty gross. I'd tell you what she does, but it would be a huge spoiler. Some of the supporting cast are interesting, particularly Kai, but most of them just lack depth. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this is really strong. The characters are well designed with the only major issue being that their eyes frequently go crossed for no reason. The backgrounds are well constructed and the action scenes have a good level of intensity while being well constructed. Although the amount of blood that breaks the laws of physics to gush out of wounds can be pretty ridiculous. Oh and, like Black Lagoon, there's a character in this who inexplicably never removes his sunglasses even when it's dark. I can kind of understand it in this case since they aren't good at drawing eyes, but that just makes you wonder why they only do it with one character. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is pretty good. The biggest issue is that most of the characters don't have a lot of emotional range so the seiyu tend to use the same general tone for most of the anime. They still do well though. Particularly Yoshino Hiroyuki and Saito Chiwa since they do get to demonstrate quite a bit of emotional range. The music varies. Some of it is kind of bland and some of it is really good. To give some examples, the music they use for victorious moments is excellent and the music they use for suspenseful scenes is overdone. It sounds more suitable for action scenes than suspense. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 3/10. Saya and Kaori's relationship seems to go beyond friendship, but their relationship is only really explored in the first few episodes. They do get to interact a few times after that but there's not a lot of it. It would probably earn a higher rating if Kaori had a bigger role, but she doesn't. \\n\\n\r\nNow we move to the final rating. There are some interesting ideas here, the story is good, albeit flawed and the art is really well done. On the downside the characters aren't very well done, most of them are just lackluster, Saya is kind of obnoxious and the story does end rather weakly. My final rating is going to be a 6/10. It's decent enough but it's not anything special.",

            "content": "I chanced upon Blood+ while looking for new anime to watch, this is not an anime to be missed.  Though I have watched countless of anime, this anime has one of the most lasting and strongest impression on me.  \r\n-----\r\nStory\r\n-----\r\nIn the beginning, the story is gritty and hard to watch as it lays down the foundation for the plot, but the pace quickens as it reaches the middle.  While the story may be somewhat predictable, it manages to deliver the predictable plot in a refreshing way.  50 episodes may sound alot, however while watching it, it has managed to hold meon the edge of the seat to watch it right to the end.  The story itself seems plain and nothing special, but it dives into the details making you to want more.   The plot development was well done, leaving no loop holes to anyone to guess at.  A well rounded development in both story and plot.\\n\\n\r\n------\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\n-----\\n\r\nIts art is better than the general anime.  Yet while watching you may notice the intricate details that the artist has drawn in - the weapons, the scenery. The expressions of the characters have been drawn well.\\n\\n\r\n------\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n------\\n\r\n The soundtrack of this anime is one of the most amazing ones I have heard.  The essence of the scene captured perfectly. It was been able to convey the emotions of what one might feel in that situation without much support of the art. Moreover to listen to it on its on, despite not being much of a classical music fan, I have found it extremely enjoyable to listen to.  Having said that, it was composed by Mark Mancina who is a Hollywood composer, having such an excellent soundtrack might not be such a surprise after all.  \\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n-----\\n\r\nMost animes lack proper character development, animes that have good character development are few and I am probably able to count on without them without using my toes.  Blood+ however, specializes in this.  Each character developed proper with an indepth view of his/her background and personality change.  This makes its refreshing to watch. \\n\\n\r\n-----\\n\r\nValue\\n\r\n-----\\n\r\nI seldom re-watch animes and animes rated 8 and above are too few to count.  I have enjoyed Blood+ throughly despite having re-watched far too much (I think 10x times is a little too much too)",

            "content": "It is interesting. At first, it seems that it\u2019s a typical anime about vampires but then you realize that there is not typical. The plot is quite original. This anime keeps many mysteries and doesn\u2019t disclose all the cards until the end. Even in the end we have place for the imagination.. For example, (how can I do no spoiler?!  =.=) what will be with Haji and Saya, Kai and girls. Their future remains a mystery. Some say that 50 episodes it's too long but I would have looked more 50! After all, it would be interesting to see history from Diva\u2019s eyes, tofind out what will happen than, to sea the history of the mummy. \\n\\n\r\nOf course in anime there are some minuses but they aren\u2019t so big. I don\u2019t like some snot\u2019s of plot. Saya is so poor. Her father, Rick, and other...sad. But without this it would be probably boring. Another puzzling that Saya must 100 times to die but the enemy retreated all the time! \\n\\n\r\nAlso there are many interesting characters. Haji is more) He is really nice, he loves Saya. Even though he is obliged to defend her but he did it not because of this, rather because of love. Great pair. Nathan surprised me. He didn\u2019t love Diva, I was simply interested. Many times he saved from death Saya of the  hand of other Diva\u2019s shivalie. Why? And what he said for Anshel, about the fact that the mummy had the same feelings? How does he know? Saya killed him but we hear a familiar voice at the end and see a reporter .. Strange. Just a solid mystery. Also I like the story of Sef. \\n\\n\r\nIn general, anime is good. Interesting. The art is beautiful. Blood deserves your attention and evaluation \"Very Good\".  8/10",

It is a truely moving storyline and to those who love action/heroics/love stories this is the series for you.\r\nThere is nothing i could put down aboutthis anime because everything has been polished up to the best standards. The sounds also have a huge effect on how the emotions get put across with the music and intrumentals playing at just the right times to create that particular nerve wracking atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nhighly recommended \\n\\n",

            "content": "I just finished watching this anime and it really is a tragedy. I was all set to give Blood + a perfect 10, a honor which only Evangelion has received from me before (excuse the tongue-in-cheek ego) but while the series was great for 40 or so episodes it just couldn't land the ending. I will try not to reveal much but I need to get this off my chest. To me its almost as if the original writer died before the series was finished and didn't tell anyone how it was supposed to end. So some guy who has only seen a few clipsof the previous episode comes along and writes an ending based on limited knowledge. Other than Haji's kick ass fight scenes in the final episodes (I wont spoil much but any fight scene in which someone is impaled on the Chrysler Building and then is struck by lightning kicks ass). Also in the last five episodes when it started to have semi-political undertones and started to portray Americans as devious scheming bastards who nuke something whenever the shit hits the fan also turned me off. Read my lips; POLITICS HAS NO PLACE IN ANIME! The last episode was for me a let down and a pain to watch after I had such I hopes for the series. Blood + really is good but in retrospect it never should have gotten a 10 to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nOk on to the review:\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nUp until the final quarter of the series the story is pretty engaging and there are some story arcs where you find yourself almost forced to watch the next episode in order to see what happens. There are several twists and turns, several &quot;I did not see that coming&quot; moments and a fair amount of mystery and revelations for the majority of the series. The only reason I give the Story a 7 is because as I said the ending was just that much of a disappointment for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe graphics were stunning. Ive only seen a few animes with better eye candy than in Blood + which is surprising because usually these kind of action/adventure animes are not known for their graphics. Character Designs are pretty good for the most part as well. 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI could be wrong but I think Hans Zimmer was involved with this Anime. Even if he wasnt the music in Blood + tops that of any anime I have seen except maybe for Kanon and possibly Clannad. The voice actors did a superb job as well. I cant think of anything wrong with the sound in Blood + so perfect 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nFor an anime that takes 50 episodes to reach its conclusion you really would expect more from the characters. With a few exceptions among the top few characters, Blood + offers very little in the way of background story for a large portion of the major characters. We learn very little about most of the villains and we only get a taste of many of the protagonist's stories. Also the characters feel one dimensional near the end of the series so their development and behavior is very inconsistent. Normally I wouldn't complain this much because they did give a sufficient amount of back story for the two main characters but since we are stuck with them for 50 episodes I kinda felt like the characters around Saya seemed a bit too hollow (nothing to do with Bleach). 6 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWhat can I say I watched an anime that was 50 episodes long so I obviously enjoyed it, at least episodes 1-40. Ok I admit I first started watching it because I saw Saya wielding a Katana in a school uniform and so Blood + joins the the long list of Anime that have lured me in with such tactic but it is one of the few that I have seen to its conclusion, granted the conclusion was a bit of a let down but still. I recommend this Anime. Even though it doesn't warrant a 10 or even a 9, it is still an overall enjoyable experience. 8 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nBlood + is much like Saya's acrobatics in the first episode. It makes the most amazing jump and dazzles us as it flies through the air but it simply cannot nail the finish. 8 out of 10.",

Equally awkward was the music throughout-lackluster, dry, and often inserted at the wrong moments. \r\nAnd the characters frustrated me(this is just a personal pet peeve.) They were dimensionless, although I can't say much about the main character, Saya, since I never finished the series.\r\nThe biggest con for me is that the anime is incredibly SLOW. Again, this is just me, but I like my anime to have unrealistic timelines that doesn't bore me into multitasking whilewatching an episode.\\n\\n\r\nDisclaimer: I realize that I have not seen all the episodes so my opinion is partial, but an important criteria when judging a show, to me, is that it captures the viewers into anticipating the next episode. The above was what I got from the first few (5 or 6) episodes. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict: good plot, terrible delivery. 2/10",

            "content": "Blood+ is a very touching and dark story. The story is about a young girl, (Saya) who has a very unfair destiny to complete. Maybe, the first image you get when you read the summary of this anime, is a boring story about some violence, vampires and lots of blood. That's absolutely not the point here! The reason I gave the story a high score (Rate: 9) is because of the thrilling scenes and very tense moments. You can not stop watching. The first episode begins peaceful, but you discover after ten minutes the opposite; another reason why the story is very good. \"You neverknow what happends next.\" I don't want to spoil, so I ain't able to describe more about the story, than saying it drags you in. If you have completed the anime, it will hunts you down for some weeks. Especially the last ten episodes, when the final showdown is near its end. And, I said earlier: it's not only dark, mysterical and exciting, it's touching too. Sometimes, I nearly started crying. At the end I cried for sure. It's so unfair and sad. But although the anime spins around darkness, it has its happy and comics too. That's another good thing about the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not very special. (Rate: 8)  It matches good with the story's darkness, but it's not astonishing. Backgrounds and overvieuws are breathtaking, but the characters could be a little better. Don't think it's bad, but it's not amazing too. The second part (episode 25 -- 50 ) looks way better than the first. Maybe because Saya's hair is longer and she wears another suit?\\n\\n\r\nThe music is perfect. The OST's are very well made and do match the moments, scenes and episodes brilliantly. I gave this one a 10. The openings are nice too. :)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. I discoverd my interesting for almost every character in this anime. They are pieces of the anime, everyone is important and has something to do with the events. If one would be erased, the anime could fall apart. That is a very nice thing. So you are sure you don't look to some unimportant persons who'll never show up again. Every person has its own history and stories. They are not put in \"good\" or \"bad\". Sometimes, good persons turn into bad guys, and the opposite can be too. The main character Saya isn't a very holy character at all. This makes the anime interesting. Relationships, friendships, family and love is in every episode. Some more than another, but you can find them growing or beginning to grow. Maybe, you didn't expect something like that in this anime? Yes, you can be assured of that! No, Blood+ isn't very unorginal and boring anymore, do you think?\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment is a 10 as well. I think I had every emotion with this 50 episodes. I could be angry because of some moments, or was laughing my ass off. At the end and in the middle, I cried. It was just too sad. And I had moments I watched three hours at night. Yeah, very addicted. :)\\n\\n\r\nMy average rate is a 9. I am very happy I tried this anime and watched it completely. I am sure it was one of the best animes in my life. I think everyone can like Blood+, because it's divers and isn't only about blood or something like that. It's very touching, has it's happy, sad and tense moments. And after all: it's a onelife time experience",

No chaff or filler episodes to my recollection; all ~50 episodes stay on track. \r\nI like all of the characters, for the most part: the main character has an annoyingtendency to state the most obvious crap that made me want to face palm; she also screams (the same way) every time she gets into a fight which became pretty funny to me by the end. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: Nothing stood out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nThis anime definitely nails the whole \"rising action\" thing; it is paced very well and I wasn't able to put it down. Before I knew it, it was finished and I was seeing the credits. The Achilles Heel of the show, I feel, is the main character's lack of a strong personality and staying power, relative to others in different anime.

I guess this show is not worth rewatching if you're not as forgetful as me.\r\nThe series' enviroment is good and the soundtrack is also good. I loved almost all the openings and endings (there are 4 each). But the plot... oh boy, that could have been great. The plotline is: the main character has to kill all the chiropteans (vampires) and Diva, the main antagonist (also a chiroptean). Sounds really stupid but at some points this is very well played and really entertaining. Also, there's a little discussionabout blood family VS non-related family, which is interesting but poorly executed. It could be a really good show if it wasn't for Saya, who is really tedious, and all this \"humans VS chiropteans\" thing, that mostly shows a self-centered mankind and a stupid and entirely avoidable fight (oddly, chiropteans noticed it quicker than humans).\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Saya Otonashi, looks like a pretty good heroine at the beginning. But then you start discovering that she's just a really really spoiled kid who can't think about anyone except herself and some people she might befriend. For years and years, she keeps trying to kill Diva because Diva is supposedly bad. But that's not true. Diva is indeed something like a psycho but it's because she's been tortured and used her whole life. It would be reasonable (and tragic) to hunt Diva if Saya didn't know about this but she's given evidence about it ALL THE TIME. There's even a chapter where someone TELLS HER about it and stuff. And Saya does what??? Instead of saying \"Ok, you guys are SO DAMN CRAZY and you TORTURED SOMEONE FOR YEARS and now you're trying to kill her, it's pretty obvious she would hate all of you. I'M OUT, I'm not killing anyone, you're all really crazy people, go get some treatment\", she says something like \"Ooooh, nooo, this all my fault, she's sooooo bad, she killed the bastard who tortured her because she's bad, she's naturally bad, nothing but bad, I will kill Diva because she's bad. Have I already said she's bad??? Oh, I hate Diva, she's bad, bad, bad\". That's so spoiled I can't stand it. Saya is one of the worst protagonists I've ever seen because she's (em)pathetic with basically anyone except Diva, for just no reason (the only possible reason is: she's spoiled).\\n\\n\r\nDiva, on the other hand, is a very interesting character and I dare to say she's the only reason you should watch this show. She one of the best antagonists I've ever seen and she has a great background story. She's MUCH MORE interesting than Saya even though the show doesn't focus much on her (at least, not compared with Saya).\\n\\n\r\nAlso, all that Siff stuff is really, really boring. The only good thing about them is that you can have some laughs since they look like goth teenagers (I found it really funny, sorry). \\n\\n\r\nThe end of the story is also pretty dull and foreseeable.",

            "content": "Let's start with a summary of what happens in the first 1 1/2 episodes:\r\nThe story begins with a scene of a massacre: A girl with red eyes and a sword slices and dices through dozens of humans and werewolf-looking monsters. Even though she is repeatedly shot by a bunch of soldiers, she just keeps murdering innocent people. The scene ends with the girl standing in front of an almost army-looking mass of those werewolf things. After the scene ends and the (very badass) opening finishes playing (you should skip it though, if you really don't want ANY spoilers), the story continues in an apparently normalJapanese high school with two apparently ordinary high school girls: Otonashi Saya and her friend Kaori.\\n\r\nThroughout the first episode, we learn that Saya can't remember anything that happened more than one year ago and she lives with her father, George and her brothers Kai and Riku. We also learn that they are not blood-related, but they were all orphans and George decided to take care of them. Kai takes Saya to the clinic from school, for a blood transfusion. Why? We find that out much, much later. After the treatment, Saya goes home and comes across a guy who plays his cello in the street. As she listens to the music and closes her eyes, something that looks like a dream scene appears: We see through the eyes of a girl in an almost medieval dress run through a corridor in what looks like a castle. After she runs up a staircase, she runs towards a locked door. She takes out the key and unlocks it, at which point Saya calls out \"Don't!\" and reaches out with her hand, as if to stop the door from being opened. Back in reality, she trips after doing so and falls right into a bush in front of several people. Saya then stands up again and quickly leaves with her face bright red, after we briefly see the face of the guy who played the cello. Afterwards, Saya returns home to her apparently happy family life. However, it turns out that Saya left her trainers at school. Blast it! So she returns to school when it is already dark outside.\\n\r\nThe scene switches to their house where Kaori brings Saya's trainers. So they aren't at school anymore. Seeing how Saya doesn't have a cellphone, George calls Kai to get Saya from school. Now, this is where it starts to get interesting. Saya searches for her trainers all over school and under a tree, she meets the cello player again. After he says \"We finally meet\" and both Saya and the audience are left to wonder what he means by that, he pulls out - guess what - a dagger! Saya does what anyone would do: run away in fear. She literally bumps into a teacher - why the heck is a teacher still at school that late at night - and asks him to search the area for that cello player. When they find nobody under the tree, a large hand from above grabs the teacher's head and pulls him right into the maze of leaves and branches. As Saya, frightened, calls for the teacher we hear chewing noises and finally the teacher's dead body is dropped, Saya does what anyone would do: just stand there, shocked. But there's no time for being shocked, as one of the monsters from the beginning suddenly shows up. Apparently, it was that monster who killed the teacher.\\n\r\nAgain, Saya does what anyone would do: run away, screaming for help. She passes through a door and locks it, hoping that it will stall the monster. But it doesn't. The monster easily breaks the glass and the door, leaving Saya injured on the ground. But she stands up anyway and tries to run, but bumps - not literally this time - into the cello player. He throws the knife from before, apparently aimed right at Saya's head, but it passes right by her and hits the monster. A few more knives hit the monster at various points, like the eye. The guy then picks up Saya and jumps right up the whole staircase (quite a jump, I gotta say) and takes her into an empty room, where he explains to Saya what the monster from before was: a Chiropteran, basically a vampire, but it looks like a werewolf. He takes out a cool-looking katana from his cello case and removes the bandage from his right hand... Now that's a sight. His right hand looks pretty much exactly like it was taken from that Chiropteran. He then cuts his palm with the katana and looks like he wants Saya to drink the blood. However, they are interrupted by the Chiropteran breaking in, who removes the knife from his eye and it heals super fast - in about 2 seconds, he has it regenerated. The cello player then drinks the blood himself and seems to kiss Saya. However, it was his true intention to get her to drink the blood. After she does, Kai comes in and discovers her, the cello player and the Chiropteran. After he sees the latter, he does what any person would do: stand there in shock.\\n\r\nNow this is where it gets very cool. After drinking the cello player's blood, Saya seems to remember things - apparently, she was the girl in the very beginning, who murdered all those innocent people! The cut on her face heals in an instant as her eyes turn red. With that, she enters an almost trance-like state, calling out \"Sword!\", extending her hand towards the cello player. He obediently hands it over and Saya draws it in a very cool-looking manner. She then cuts her hand in a very cool-looking manner and slashes right through the Chiropteran in a very cool-looking manner.\\n\r\nNow, let's stop it here and go watch it yourself if you wanna know more \\n\\n\r\nAs for the plot development:\\n\r\nI personally found Blood+'s plot very good, we gradually learn about Saya and her past, as well as about the enemy, the Chiropteran. We get tiny bits fed to us one after another, leaving us hungry for more. Not once was there a point where I was like \"Awww, it's boring, when is it gonna get interesting?\" I also liked the academy in Vietnam very much, where Saya has to hide her identity and abilities from all the other girls there, as well as Kai's girlfriend (okay, she loves him, but he doesn't love her back, but I'm still gonna stick with \"girlfriend\") and a reporter going after Saya and her group. There are lots of secrets that are gradually revelaed, such as the cello player's true identity and his connection to Saya. Also, I found all characters perfectly fitting. The only annoying thing was Riku, after he became - no that would be a spoiler. I'll only tell you that he gets annoying after ~ episode 25. As for the other characters, they all have their unique quirks and I liked all of the good guys all the way through - and despised all of the bad guys (which is a good thing), especially about halfway through the series, where you get to know their motives and background.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the action:\\n\r\nBlood+ doesn't have too much action, however, there are a few fight scenes. Most of them are pretty awesome and easily surpass standards I would expect, even though Saya and her friends often get saved by pure dumb luck - or by Solomon . In my opinion, at least. I especially like the fight at the end of episode 28, where Saya and Haji (the cello player) fend off about 8 enemies in a very badass manner. And the final fight with Diva is of course pure epicness, even though most of that epicness is in the dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nOther stuff:\\n\r\nI really liked Saya's flashback scenes, especially the \"mirror scene\" in episode 2, even though it isn't really a flashback. But it's pretty much guaranteed to freak you out. Whoever made this series really knows how to pique the audience's curiosity over Saya's past.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nOverall, I find that Blood+ is an awesome anime, with 1 being the worst rating and 10 the best, I'd give Blood+ definitely a 9 or 9,5. The reason it doesn't get a 10 is because there are some characters who should've been granted a comeback, such as Saya's friend Min from the academy in Vietnam.\\n\r\nTo conclude this review, let me say that if you are interested in supernatural stuff such as Bleach, you should definitely watch Blood+. The plot is better than Bleach in my opinion, and it's a lot more serious, which is a good thing. At least I think so.",

You grow up with these characters and feel their hardships in the stuff they face.\r\nNot only that but you get to see some great vampire fights.\r\nEven if you havent seen Blood the Last Vampire, you will still enjoy this. It is filled with twists and tragedies that will have you crying yourself.\r\nI would definitely recommends this to anyonewho enjoys a great story and great characters.",

            "content": "It's been a few years now, and I still think of Blood+ almost daily. All I can say is, if you haven't watched this anime, you haven't lived. To be fully honest... I don't even know what to say. I guess I'll just tell my story...\r\nA few years back, before I even heard of the word \"anime\" my family was hosting a Christmas party. At my Christmas party, me and my cousin were in my room, being the socially-awkward people we are, instead of socializing with my other family members. He mentioned how he is obsessed with this \"anime\" called \"Air Gear\" or something alongthose lines. He introduced me to the first episode, but other than the ecchi aspect to it, I wasn't a fan. So naturally I moved on to the next show. This time it was my turn to choose. I decided that I did like the art aspect to \"Air Gear\" and I was looking for another show in the \"anime\" category. That's when I stumbled upon Blood+. After the first episode I was hooked, and so was my cousin. We watched a few episodes together that night, and he made me promise I wouldn't go ahead. I promised, but admittedly I wasn't very faithful to my promise, as I immediately continued watching as soon as he shut my door and left my house. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development in this anime is fantastic, it's truly a work of art. I regret however, watching it dubbed. Since I was new to the whole \"anime\" thing, I decided against watching it subbed, and boy do I regret that. In the future, I do plan on re-watching Blood+ in subbed, but not right now. Blood+ was absolutely outstanding. The most underrated anime to date (in my opinion of course). I recommend it to everyone, even to those who haven't seen anime or those who dislike anime. If you're reading this, and you haven't watched Blood+ yet, I ask you to trust me, and watch this masterpiece as I can guarantee you will not regret it. If you don't, that's okay too, but just know that you are missing out on a mental roller coaster that will, without a doubt leave you breathless.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nAt this point, twists on the traditional legends of vampires have pretty much become the norm in just about any type of media. However, anime is particularly infamous for it. Generally, they put a twist on the legend using their own folklore and making them mutants or demons rather than the undead, with sucking blood being practically the only resemblance to the original legend they've got. \"Blood+\" is one such anime, and while it's not without many flaws, it's still a nice and welcome twist on an outdated tale.\r\nStory (8/10):\r\nIt's very hard to delve into the story without presenting some spoilers but I'm going totry anyway. Basically, it follows Saya Otonashi, a seemingly normal girl who lives peacefully with her adoptive family and has no memory of who she is or where she came from. One night, she crosses paths with a mysterious man named Hagi, who appears to know her very well and obeys her every command. Furthermore, an agent named David who appears to be well acquainted with Saya's adoptive father appears and says that he needs Saya for something. One thing leads to another, and it's not long before Saya and her family are caught up in a battle against creatures called Chiropterans, and Saya slowly begins to remember her mysterious past and reason for her existence, assisted by the anti-Chiropteran military organization Red Shield. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty slow to start, as it's only until episode 6 that something significant happens, and it's only until episode 8 or 9 that we finally get a good idea about exactly what Saya and Red Shield are up against. This certainly isn't helped by the fact that Hagi, David and the others refuse to tell Saya anything about her past, as they believe that it's best for her to remember on her own. Not to mention that when she regains her memories, they regret not telling her as it would have saved a lot of trouble.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, I can thankfully say that the second half is vastly superior to the first, as it is far more fast-paced and is overall just much more interesting and exciting. The fight takes the group to all sorts of locations, from a hotel to a snowy landscape to a theatre, and Saya slowly grows from a scared girl who can barely fight to save her life to a highly competent warrior who can kick blood-sucking monster ass, albeit with a lot of help from Hagi. The story of Saya's past is also very interesting, as it ties brilliantly with the villains and is crucial for her character development. The origin of Chiropterans is great as well, and things aren't as black and white as they seem at first. The story ultimately proves to be very interesting and unique in spite of the slow start and manages to keep you interested throughout its 50 episodes, all the way up to a well-thought out conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation (8.5/10):\\n\r\nThe art is very impressive for the show's time, which is from 2005-2006. The characters and monsters are all very well-drawn and the animations are mostly quite smooth, though they can also be rather stiff at times. My favourite effect is when Saya kills a Chriopteran by stabbing it with her sword, which causes the beast to crack up and crumble into pieces. It's a very well-done effect that's used really well throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Dialogue (7/10):\\n\r\nThis is, unfortunately, the low point of the series. The soundtrack is generally made up of generic tunes that fail to stand out and are quickly forgettable. There are 4 openings and 4 ending themes but none of them are memorable and I skipped them every time. Thankfully, there are two exceptions to this- \"Saya's Victory\" and \"Diva\". The voice acting isn't the best either; Kari Wahlgren and Crispin Freeman both deliver strong performances as the lead pair but apart from them, the voice acting is mostly average and can actually be pretty poor in places, with some voices not sounding right at all. The sound never gets unbearable, especially since the dialogue is mostly good, but I have definitely heard much better. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.5/10):\\n\r\nLet's start with Saya. As I mentioned before, she starts off as a scared girl who can barely fight to save her life but as she regains her memories she gets stronger and stronger. Well, I should say more skilled, since physically she isn't much stronger than a human, and so relies on martial arts and swordplay, which thankfully allows her to easily hold her own against more powerful opponents. Unfortunately, with her extra power comes serious consequences, since her past was definitely not sunshine and daisies. About three-quarters through the series, you really get the impression that the entire world is out to break her, as she suffers one tragedy after another, making you hope that the poor girl will finally catch a break when everything's over. She does have an annoying habit of pointing out the obvious, but overall she is a great protagonist and the best character the series has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nComing a close second is Saya's bodyguard, Hagi. He starts off as a typical, stoic quiet character, rarely talking and when he does he only says a few sentences. He also follows Saya's every command regardless of what it is, almost to the point of being a pushover. His character development revolves around him outgrowing this and considering what he wants, and it begins to show in later episodes as he starts to voice his opinion more and more. He's also just as (or at first more) capable a fighter as Saya, even when he's holding back, though he still ends up getting injured by almost every enemy he fights.\\n\\n\r\nNext up is the other two main protagonists- Red Shield special agent David and Saya's adopted older brother Kai. As I mentioned before, their voice acting isn't anything special but they're at least well-written- David is the hardened war veteran with a heart of gold while Kai is the hot-headed teenager with a heart of gold. David doesn't have any powers like Saya and Hagi, but he makes up for that with his sheer force of will, as he doesn't let anything keep him down for long- he's even described in-series as being indestructible. Kai, on the other hand, starts off as rather annoying and immature, as well as pretty selfish, but thankfully he becomes more responsible and likable as the series progresses. But while the main cast is very good, the supporting cast is less so, and there are definitely quite a few I think the show could have done without and others that were just underused. I can say the villains are interesting, however.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7.5/10):\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, the series takes several episodes to get going, so you definitely need some patience if you want to watch it to the end. This is also a very dark series, and while the show gets more exciting in later episodes, it also gets a lot more depressing. There's also a sense of danger and quite a few characters don't make it to the end. If you can't handle all that, then I would definitely advise staying away.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n\"Blood+\" certainly isn't the best anime I've ever seen, but it's still a unique and interesting twist on the old legend of vampires. In spite of the slow start, forgettable soundtrack and variable voice acting, \"Blood+\" is a very good series to watch, with an intriguing story, great action and good character development.\\n\\n\r\nScore:\\n\r\n8+8.5+7+7.5+7.5=38.5/50=7.7/10",

            "content": "First of all, the episodes are a lot. And when it's a lot, viewers will have expectations. We would wish that the main characters ( respectively Saya and Diva ) are the ones who will mature more, become wiser and stronger, we get to see their full struggle and understandings regarding their motives and stories. \r\nBut there aren't as much as developments that we wished to see. Perhaps we wish for too much, given that Saya, a sixteen years old girl, is expected to mature and become wiser like her fellow brother and comrades. \r\nBut the truth is, Saya isn't just a sixteen years oldgirl. Whether she accept it or not, she is a 100 year old something and not a human. She's a vampire with humanity, but not a human. The disappointment come from the fact that she is supposed to be the protagonist here and battle against \"evil\" aka Diva. \\n\r\nBut Diva has no time to \"accept the fact that she's a vampire/monster\". She was locked away. She has no friends, no family, she was simply an animal and test subject for years. She has no pink dresses and pink roses, no Hagi, no father or brothers, no schools, and even her chevaliers have no interest in her personal life; one seeks power, one admires her talent, one was forced into it, and so on, and so on. She has her sister chasing her with the intent of killing her but she shows no fear. She destroys a lot, but so does Saya. \\n\\n\r\nGiven the many episodes, one would wish that we get to see the character more develops, because there is a lot of room for that. But no, everything is solely focused on Saya. \\n\\n\r\nThe truth is i admire Saya. She is strong, gentle, and will do anything in her power to protect her family, all the strong points we would want in a hero. But the way the story and overall characters develops, we can expect nothing else. \\n\\n\r\nI understand Saya in a way; she is so full of guilt and desperation. If anyone were to stand in her place, one would understand. How much she have done, how much she have sacrificed, and likewise, how much damage she has caused too. She is just want to be done with it. It's like she is chasing her own karma. But what i wish from a character like her, especially given the fact that she is has the same blood as the supposed \"bad guy\", is that she understand better, better than her human comrades. What humans can do except study, guessing, and analyze ? Saya though, can just feel it in herself that the kinds like her are a lot more complex than just \"monsters.\" Things aren't just so black and white. She never once questions the motives of the humans. Why creating these \"schiff\"/monsters ? If anything, Diva was so used by the humans for her power. \\n\\n\r\nTowards the end of the series, perhaps there is an attempt to be sympathetic for both Saya and Diva, but there's no point in it. It would've work if it's on episodes 25 or 30, so that we can learn more about the characters, we can actually see the characters try to be themselves rather than just doing what they are \"supposed to do\". Saya is \"supposed\" to kill Diva and Diva is \"supposed\" to be the bad person. \\n\\n\r\nThis is all a story about guilt. I understand Saya's point of view, though. Her sadness perhaps comes from her feeling guilty, but rather than trying to understand and take control of her own view on her own, she always ended up rely on others (particularly her brother) of what to do. \\n\\n\r\nMy only concern is this : Saya is willing to sacrifice herself. But for what point, she needs to ask herself. Stopping Diva ? From what ? Diva has no clear goals in her evil scheme whatsoever. And supposed Saya feel curious as to who her sister actually is, and understand her, like how much all these humans around her try to understand her and get to know her, that despite her past and urges, she is actually a kind person ? That even though Saya is \"a monster\", a different species, she can have friends, feels sadness and have dreams, attached to a home or memories, and even fall in love, perhaps ? \\n\r\nShe supposed to question things more, especially things about her own kind. Everyone around Saya are trying to understand her, but not one person, not even Saya, try to understand Diva. The whole series is about Saya is a human, Diva is a subject. \\n\r\nIn this story, it's all about \"no, im not like Diva. im not a monster\". \\n\\n\r\nyes, please explain why you are not like Diva and why Diva is the way she is. The more the protagonist understand her opponents, the better. But it all feels like she knows, but she does not understand. \\n\\n\r\nIt all ended up with, \"Its my fault i let her out. \" \u2013 \u201c I let her out so I have to kill her \u201c \u2013 \u201c this is it, im going to end it with everything. \u201c \\n\r\nShe never question anyone or anything. She become mature but still underdeveloped. She cannot decide things for herself. \\n\\n\r\nSupposed Diva is kept locked, what then ? No story ? It never occurs to her about why, you might wonder, a girl is locked away ? and most importantly WHO locked her away ? Saya in this past life time was supposed to be young and naive, but not stupid and ignorant. Why would anyone be crazy enough to locked an innocent girl up there, while she, just a normal girl too, was living her normal life not too far from the tower, in her supposed father estate ? \\n\\n\r\nShe had a great life with her adoptive father and brothers and one day it's all gone. But then again, so does everyone involved in her life. All of them lost something. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, i admire Saya. But i wish how the story develops giving us more chance to see her grow and accepts reality rather than drowning in guilt. The fact is i sympathize with her so much, and she did grow up to be a responsible woman with all her heavy burdens. \\n\\n\r\nBut i wish she questions more, asks more, and look for more truth. She talks more and try to find out the truth and get to know her own kind, her own urges, her \"supposed\" opponent, etc. Because the truth is, if it weren't for her well upbringing and her friends and family, she has the same instinct as Diva. The question is, if their circumstances were the same, what would makes her any different ? \\n\r\nIf anything, all those people around Diva are the ones who are evil, as opposed to those around Saya. Those around Diva are shown to be power-hungry and possessive, while those around Saya are loving and warm, accepting. It matters a lot. \\n\r\nDiva said herself that the people that there are only two kinds of people she have met : people who adore her and people who want to kill her. Not one person ever offer friendship or help to her. One guy want to dominate the world with her power and the other is crazy about art and her ability. \\n\r\nNot one person ever have the point where they direct the core issue here : saya and diva background, their species and history, and how they can be the same as much as they can be different from humans. It\u2019s all about \u201clet\u2019s get this over it so we can go back home\u201d and saya, with her guilt, is all about \u201cending everything here and now\u201d. \\n\r\nIf anything, the red shield is using Saya too. Not one attempt that the red shield ever do to reach out to Diva to help her or take her under their care, it\u2019s all about finding/keeping the other sister so this other sister can kill her own sister. Saya is the only hope. That\u2019s it. \\n\r\nIn a way, both saya and diva\u2019s existence is all about humanities best interest. The humans demanded them, which of them that will have more humanity but all in all, everyone then forget the fact that both are humans too in a way, with hopes and fears. In the end they must sacrifice, with one of them dead. That\u2019s it. \\n\r\nThe future generations, though, have the chance that the both Saya and Diva didn't. And that's bitter-sweet understanding touches me.\\n\r\nThe best character development here is Kai. Without him, a lot of things could go wrong. He is the only human with no military background, no super power, that grow up to be stronger and have the something that no one else in this series have : an understanding. He is not the best fighter, no superhuman power, no strong background to back him up, but he understood and is able to look at the core of things. \\n\r\nAll In all, though, this is one of the best series I\u2019ve ever watched. I will remember this one for a very long time, and even will watch the whole series again and again in the future. \\n\r\nHere\u2019s also to all the friendships that Saya ever made throughout the series, and all the amazing characters that we get to see. \\n",

            "content": "Studio IG, the studio behind the super successful Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex at this point in time was just starting to come into their own as a company. For the anime Blood Plus, most of the people were involved in some way with previously mentioned Stand Alone Complex. Could this group and Studio match the success and magic of their previous work(s)? Did Blood Plus reach the feats and grit that the movie Blood The Last Vampire (2000) had, and create an in-depth and interesting storyline?\r\nOur main character, Saya Otonashi, has amnesia and is under care of an adoptive family living neara US airbase on Okinawa Island. One day, her simple life is interrupted when she is attacked by a strange blood feeding bat-human creature called a Chiropteran. Saya quickly learns she is the only one that can kill these things due to her own blood crystalizing the creature\u2019s blood. Over the course of the 50 episode series, Saya embarks on a world-wide journey (with sidekicks) to defeat an evil organization, uncover the history of the Chiropterans, and her own past.\\n\\n\r\nAt the time, or at least in the first few episodes, the animation was superb. However, it quickly became mediocre even for 2005. Details began to disappear in return for still images. The show itself can be split in half in terms of quality and the plot being interesting. Blood Plus\u2019 first half builds mystery to the characters, a complex conspiracy, and some fairly decent shock drama. However, the series then dives into a collection of terrible sub-arcs, some deaths, explosions, but in the end turns into a hot mess.\\n\\n\r\nBlood Plus goes from outstanding and tense to a mellow over dramatic story. Each fight quickly becomes not only episodic but also either prolonged fights for the sake of extending it to another episode, or the audience being forced to listen to the dying words and life tale of said victim. The goal was probably to ultimately lead to a crazy finale in which the Studio clearly lost sight of long ago. Everything becomes so predictable and repetitive for the show that even the monster-of-the-week fight scenes and the overall chase plot becomes a snooze-fest.\\n\\n\r\nIt is really hard to enjoy a show that has become a bit of a cult classic when pacing is a little on the dull side, animation quality deteriorates hard, a show clogged with uninteresting subplots that are never truly answered, plus a main plot that is delayed just for the sake of more episodes. There was so much potential going into Blood Plus, but the potential was forgotten and never explored. At least the music was really good.",

            "content": "Blood+ takes vampire folklore and twists it into something unique and well suited to the series. Although, it may seem as if it would be a boring plot where a girl travels around hunting down vicious monsters this series is very far from being boring. From the first episode it stays true to the plot and remains consistent until the very end. \r\nThe atmosphere of Blood+ is rather intense. It takes a cheery high school girl and thrusts her into a dark world filled with violence, blood, and death. Being as it is a 50 episode series I had expected for the series to, occasionally,break from it's serious atmosphere or to become episodic. The series is consistent with both the story and atmosphere and never breaks. You witness the growth of both the storyline and characters to the point where the story is much more in depth than a high school girl with a katana killing off creatures. Watching anime I often expect for a random shot of chibi characters being silly and arguing about pointless things as to entertain or relieve the viewer from the seriousness of the series but Blood+ never makes an attempt at comic relief. Although, instead, they offer you a little bit of hope for the characters and their situation, as if things are looking up, only for it to be snatched away from you. It will literally drive you to tears. The plot will not disappoint you. It unfolds at a steady pace, and will offer you enough of a story and the characters that, at the end of it, you won't think, \"I want more than this\", you will just be completely satisfied with how everything panned out. Blood+ is rich with a beginning, middle, and end. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Blood+ are extremely well developed. As you watch the series it's as if you are watching them grow before your eyes. What I love about this series the most is how in depth and real the characters of Blood+ are. Despite having inhuman capabilities even the main character is of human nature in personality. In fact, you may even find yourself feeling sorry for the most sadistic villain of the series. Characters that are young and lack knowledge and understanding from the beginning mature as the series progresses. The situations they extract their experiences from make them grow stronger in character. Even if they know they are weak against the enemy they continue fighting as to support the one character who is able to end the misery brought on by chiropterans. Even adult characters that seem to have an understanding that the youth lacked are thrown into situations that cause them to experience something as a means of development in their character. A lot of the characters are often faced by the confusion of their own emotions and, as such, change drastically from their revelations. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the series was very enjoyable. It remained consistent to the plot and atmosphere with an excellent beginning, middle, and end. All the questions you could have had about the series are answered and you are not left in confusion at the end. The characters are strong, likeable, and well developed. After the very last episode of the series you could possibly be taken aback by how good the series actually was. \\n\\n\r\nI would most definitely suggest you give Blood+ a try.",

I actually just finished watching the last episode this morning at 4:00am, after spending two days straight watching the whole series. I am not going to lie I knew about the series since it came out in 06 but I just never gave it the time of day because I thought it would be just a stupid vampire plot that was either endless or shallow. I was completely wrong, a friend who had watched it convinced me too, I admit the first 3 or 4 episodes seem painfully slow and way too soft for whata dark anime should be. It got interesting very quickly, and soon I could not stop watching, hence the reason I turned off my phone and locked my self up for the last couple days. The story as described is about a girl named saya fighting vampire like beings, but this is only a main theme to the plot. The real story is how Saya deals with being different and coming to except herself as she is and how she interacts with humans. The story is dark and like my other fav, code geass (also a bandai film), they are not afraid to kill main and lovable characters in order to progress the story line (I am trying not to spoil but I want to give you a good ideal of how dark this anime is). This anime is really about one girls hardships, feelings, and suffering. It will blow your mind and make you think in a different manner.",

Action-wise the animation felt a little dull but not terrible.\r\nSound\r\nWell I watched the English dub for this one, the voice actors where well chosen but nothing extraordinary yet again.\r\nOpening and Ending was average yet again..i mean average comes to mind so much I dunno what else to say.\r\nStory\r\nOne word keeps coming to mind when I think about the story\u2026..POTENTIAL.\r\nOnce I got to the end of the anime and I knew the whole story I foundmyself thinking it had a lot of potential but the implementation of the story was mismatched, slow and it just feels very anti-climactic. I was disappointed because it felt like the story stole elements from various other anime and it came off like another TYPICAL monsters vs. the hero anime. I think people who watched the movie blood will definitely be disappointed with the scope of story but then again that\u2019s just my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nThe whole range of characters include military guys, scientists, whiny useless tag-alongs and siya herself. In saying that I did\u2019nt really have anything in particular against the characters they were all just as predictable as pie with little or no depth to them even the mysterious siya herself which was the most disappointing and surprising part.\\n\\n\r\nValue\\n\\n\r\nVery low value, I wouldn\u2019t buy it, recommend it or watch it again. Chances are if you like this and give/gave it a high rating you haven\u2019t seen a lot of anime series like this before, SHANA for example, which is not great but better than this. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Comments\\n\\n\r\nIf you watched the movie BLOOD and are expecting a similar series you will be in for a unpleasant surprise. BLOOD+ is not the worst anime I\u2019ve seen but I just like watching anime with originality and depth.

            "content": "Main  \r\nWhen I watched the first couple episodes of Blood+, The first thing that came to mind was &ldquo;What in the [beeeeeeeep] did they do to my show?&rdquo; Anyone who has seen the original Blood knows what time it is....Blood was pretty hardcore, no bones about it! So my initial reaction to seeing this new Blood+ [and Saya] amongst all this peaceful scenery and at a regular school leading this idyllic home life complete with parent and siblings was a complete and utter shock to the system indeed. But then as this amazing story unfolds, I realized that this show way better thanit seemed at first. Even if the art style is kind of shoujo, do NOT let that mislead you or dissuade your from watching this series!\\n\\n\r\n Art-Style \\n\r\nBlood +, has VERY good animation...I'd even say it was excellent! There is extensive CG work used on this tries&mdash;rather tastefully I might add&mdash;for general vehicular movement such as cars, boats, helicopters etc. CG is also used for a lot of the architectural shots and camera pans like when character is running down or thru hallways of a building. A lot of the special FX used for the action scenes were CG, most notably would have to be FX used for when the SCHIFF members fought.\\n\r\nI don't know what more could be required from this show! There are a lot of exotic scenes as the character travel across Europe and Asia. There is a lot of attention to the artistic details in making each locale look authentic.\\n\r\nThis show is a fantasy show but there are some very powerful imagery being used....with countless scenes that burn their way into your mind! Personally, I loved the battle on the train in Russia and that image of the lady jumping off the train at half speed.....is was very cool in that Matrix/Trinity kind of way. There were also some pretty unforgettable battle scenes!\\n\\n\r\n Sound \\n\r\nI actually only liked the 3rd OP and ED songs and the art sequences that go with them. So for me this gets the lowest score. The Japanese voice cast did a great job, tho! I really appreciated their work.\\n\\n\r\n Story \\n\r\nThe biggest attribute and main seller for this series is it's story! Blood+ has a very solid and compelling storyline....in fact it is so compelling that once the ball gets rolling it's pretty hard to stop...there have been many a night that I had to forgo sleep because I stayed up watching this series and then still having to go to work the next day. But it's like a good book you can't put down!\\n\r\nThe original Blood movie, though excellent in it own right, was very incomplete and left a lot of questions unanswered. The Blood + series did a great job filling in the holes and offered an intriguing story. At first I thought giving Saya a family and a &ldquo;regular&rdquo; life was a mistake but now I understand how vital it was to start the series the way it did...which made the show all the more riveting as Saya and her family evolve.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to spoil anything for anyone, but I feel I must say that if you don't like characters dying off...then you need to factor this into your decision-making whether to watch this or not. Because if you're like me then you'll be sad [also if you do not like gore....there's lots!] In the anime world it's really not so surprising to see main characters die, but somehow I was still shocked......even when trivial side characters died, I was shocked and saddened. That's proof that this is as good show and how excellent the story was being told&mdash;If you can feel something for the death of a SUPPORTING character [forget about the main characters], then you have a good story on your hands! \\n\\n\r\n Character \\n\r\nWhen I think about the characters of this series, I also wind up thinking about the characters from FullMetal Alchemist. There's no real explanation why I've linked these two sets of characters except in my minds eye, I do see a lot of similarities. For starters, this isn't just a cut and dry case of Good Guys v. Bad Guys. Sure, you may start out with one team versus another team but then you see all these smaller factions and third party forces popping out of the woodwork.....and before you know it the Good Guys may not necessarily be that good and the same goes for the bad guys.\\n\r\nAnother reason why I may have linked the Blood + characters to the FMA characters might be because of the &ldquo;super-powers&rdquo; element. In FMA the &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; all went under the umbrella term Homunculus but each of them had their unique powers tied to their personality; with Blood+ the bad guys are called Vampires [or Chiropetra&mdash;something or other] but they each had their own unique personalities and their own brand of super powers.\\n\\n\r\nOne final note about these characters, is that I see a certain level of sadness with all the characters, good or bad, they seem sad even when they're smiling....I don't really know why, but is was the same with the FMA characters too. \\n\\n\r\n Worth it or NOT? \\n\r\nHells yeah this is worth getting!",

            "content": "Blood+ is about a high school girl fighting monsters with her trusty sword....\r\n Sounds generic when you put it like that....but, keep reading my review! Trust me, this anime is a lot more than that!!\r\nBlood+ is actually a really good anime! I highly, HIGHLY recommend it out of the others in the blood series, (Blood the last vampire & Blood-c) because of its richer story and better character development.\r\nThe lore with the monsters is fascinating, though I feel the information about them is kinda incomplete... I guess that's fine since the scientists where still experimenting on them and discovering new things. \r\nThe charactersstray away from the generic stereotypes/tropes which makes most of them, especially the main character, feel realistic with fleshed out personalities. Even the main antagonist of the series has a level of sympathy when you get a better understanding of her. \\n\\n\r\n The story is a dark adult series with the main girl killing vampire like monsters and completeing her mission. It's like a horror battle series with a level of mystery to it. It's no where close to the assumption that it's an action story about an overly cute girl swinging a sword. This show feels grounded in reality with humanity being at war with a rising species of blood thirsty monsters...so yeah this show get DARK. Though it's not all dark there's some suspense, tear jerking, and sweet moments in the anime. Like when Saya is spending time playing catch with her brothers. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is lovely, pretty good for back then and holds up pretty well. Though a knit-pick I have is Diva's lip-synch when she's singing. The song is the same in both dubs so not sure why she couldn't of been animated better when singing...I guess that would of been time consuming?\\n\\n\r\nThe dubbing in both languages is really good though in the beginning of the anime some characters like David sounded a little off in dire situations. I also noticed that the last scene in the final episode wasn't even dubbed....why? \\n\\n\r\nOver all this is a really good anime that I can't recommend enough! \\n",

            "content": "Blood+ is an Anime that comes around very rarely. With an amazing story, sound, characters (except for one), and overall enjoyment, Blood+ is one of my personal favorites. Set in an alternate world to the movie Blood: The Last Vampire, The story revolves around a young girl named Saya who is apparently the only girl who can stop the vampire like monsters known as Chiroptera. I will Divide this Review into each of the 5 Sections.\r\nStory:\r\nThe Writing in this Anime is phenomenal. The work, although based off the original movie, Is incredibly Original and is Very different from the original work. The Chiroptera are notlike ordinary Vampires, which made me very happy. They seem more like savage monsters who don't think and just eat. There are however, different types of Chiroptera. I won't get into it because of spoilers, but the concept of the Chiroptera is very interesting and is pulled off successfully.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art was one of the two issues I had with the anime. The scenery is beautiful but the characters lack originality. Saya, who is the main character, has a weird looking mouth that distracts you from the Amazing writing. I had to watch the beginning over again because I couldn't stop staring at her mouth. This doesn't take away the greatness of the show, but instead distracts you from it. It is a problem, but I won't take this into my Overall score.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI personally love the soundtrack of Blood+. Diva's song is great and fits in perfectly with the mood of the show. Even the other pieces of music were well placed into the events of the show. The sounds of the Chiroptera sounded original and I didn't notice anything Bad about it. Other sound effects like the swords or guns seemed normal and fit in perfectly with the show. The sound effects were nothing special, But didn't take away anything from the story itself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThis section holds the biggest problem in my opinion. Almost all the characters were well developed. The only thing I had a problem with is Kai. I found Kai to be the most annoying character I've ever seen. Kai is basically Saya's \"brother\" even though they are not blood related. Kai is like the male version of Kagome from Inuyasha. He constantly thinks about Saya and is kind of an asshole to everyone else. Riku is another sibling of Saya's and is actually very likeable. Riku has the right balance of love for Saya and Love for everyone else. Haji is probably one of my favorite characters in this anime, next to David and Solomon. I even Love the villains of the show. The ONLY person I hate is Kai. This character brought my overall score to a 9. That's pretty bad.",

            "content": "So the basic storyline of this anime is about a girl can't remember anything of her past. The only thing she knows is that the family she lives with aren't her real family. Eventually as the story goes on, she meets various characters and soon to discover about her past and more importantly, about herself. \r\nI'm pretty bad with a brief description of this series because there's just too much to write about. But that's the basic storyline. \r\nStory: \r\nThe overall story is very precise and uses great amount of details. I would give it a 9/10 because the story wasn't too original for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThis series is one of my favorite kind of art style. I would say, the animation was pretty good and they did a great job at the details and some of the scenerios were amazing. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe first thing I did after finishing this series, was to find the Original Soundtrack. During my time watching it, I focused so much on the music, because it was so beautiful and fit well with each scenes. And I would really recommend the OST. \\n\r\nThe OP/ED were great and the animation for it was pretty awesome too espcially the 2nd OP. I like the way how the OPs were pretty fast beat and pumped me up for the next episode while the ED were more soft, and slow. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWow, I would give it a 20/10 if I could for character development. Aside from the fact that it IS a long series (50 episodes is pretty long for me lol), the character development was purely amazing. I fell in love with all the character, and not just the main characters. I think for me, since I'm into romance and what not, they did a good job fitting romance in it as well. \\n\r\nBasicaly, the character development gotta be the main point of this series. I felt the emotion most of the character's were feeling because they all had different feelings. ahhh its great not to mention Haji and Solomon xD \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is a good series to watch, and for those who don't enjoy long series like I do, it's pretty worth watching. My first expectation from the first episode is totally different from after watching it. Ill also have to point out that, this series got everything from full packed action to romance and humor to suspense. So try it, you won't be disappointed.\\n",

I spent at the very least a week enthralled by this anime and spent as much time as I possibly could watching it. I feel like this is an amazing anime. =^x^=",

            "content": "Sigh. This is another anime that has been sitting on my \"I need to finish watching it some day\" list for years.\r\nHow should I put it.\r\nHave you ever seen series where you could see an amazing potential, then just had to watch the show to fail to reach the full potential, despite trying very very hard? Well... this is this kind of show. \r\nI've rated it 6/10, and 6/10 Story, 6/10 Art, 6/10 Sound, 5/10 Character, 5/10 Enjoyment, 6/10 Total.\r\nThis is probably the closest there will be ever be to properly realizing full potential of Saya's story from Blood the Last Vampire. Unfortunately, it isnot good enough to be considered a masterpiece, it fails to reach its full potential. Watching this anime is very, very, frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, it starts with interesting premise, produces decent first season, then things start deteriorating, and devolve into some sort of melodrama with characters occasionally spending time stating \"moral statements\", almost in shounen-like fashion. Fairly convincing fights from the first episodes are then displaced with almost comical abilities that on the level of superpowers. For example, very early you'll get characters that can move very far away at blink of eye without triggering a shockwave somehow. Compared to the first episodes that looked like they were trying to be realistic - to the extent it is possible wit ht he premise - this is very odd.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what we have is an oddity. Nice core idea. Nice art. Good music. Characters are mediocre, however, a lot of them with wooden acting. There's a large variety of locales over the course of the show, which doesn't happen often. However, it lacks some sort of \"punch\" that would make it great, and sluggishly and slwoly drags out for 50 episodes, reaching.... not very interesting conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nSigh. I'm not sure how this could possibly have been done better, but it definitely doesn't reach the potential, and this is frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nDetailed breakdown is below:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10: The reason why it is 6/10 is largely because of scope, and because of occasional nice moments it has. The story has a problem, because it starts with interesting premise, but then slows down to crawl, and throws many pointlessly melodramatic moments that were supposed to trigger some sort of response, but usually don't. As I also mentioned, there's inconsistent level of \"powers\" throughout the anime. At the beginning we get more or less realistic depiction of the world, but later there are peopel with magical abilities. Closer to the end, or to be more specific, past the first season, the story largely looks like collection of backdrops, and resembles some sort of not very convincing theatrical play. But still... it is ambitious you can give it that. And closer to the end  it has one nice moment that adds some redeeming values to it that shifts it from 5/10 to 6/10... Still... I can't think of how it could've done better and more believable. Something is definitely amiss with it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10: It is surprisingly detailed for a TV show. Clean detailed style, characters are realistic. Nobody is ever going into chibi mode here, characters are adult proportioned. Basically, they pretty much wanted to make it look realistic as possible, when it comes to visuals.Character designs are fairly good as well.... I mean monsters aren't interesting, but visuals of characters themselves are unique enough and interesting enough.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10: Soundtrack is nice, but the same tracks are played many times over course of 50 episodes. At some point they nice music starts leaving next to no impact.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10: Character interaction is not good, and same goes for character portrayal There's a lot of instances of somebody pointlessly talking baoaut something. Some cliched interactions. Melodrama. Many attempts to overdramatize something. Basically... I think there was maybe one moment total where I felt sympathetic towards someone.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10: It is simply too long and drag out for too long. By the 30th episode the show loses all of its initial momentum and moves slowly towards the ending, while events that happen in it become less and less and less plausible. The world fail to react to catastrophes. The powers of characters become more and more magical. People act oddly. This... gets annoying.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10: I'll rate it 6/10 for trying but... the thing is I cna't recommend this anime. As i said, this is probably one of the best attempts to retell saya's story (and it is SIGNIFICANTLY better than the abomination called BloodC), but the anime doesn't achieve its full potential and this is frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe if you have a ton of time and absolutely nothing else to watch you could give this one a try, but after finishing the anime myself, I could only think that idea behind Saya could use a much better story.",

            "content": "I really don\u2019t like writing and try to avoid it. However, Blood+ is really special in a sense that it motivated someone as indolent as me to write this review in order to share my enjoyment with you. Ok enough babbling, let\u2019s get to the review. \r\nIn terms of plot progression, the series is full of suspense, leaving the audience dying to figure out the unanswered questions (e.g. regarding Saya\u2019s past). The series also kept the audience excited with full of plot twists and surprises. Some surprises are really mind fuckers! Yet, the surprises did not seem awkward at all thanks to the help ofwell planned foreshadowing. \\n\\n\r\nThe central theme of Blood+ deals with several difficult dilemmas. For example, what does it mean to be human? Is it true that whatever is in the best interest of the humans always the right thing to do? Is it right to choose the life of your only family member in the world over saving humanity? The choice for the previous question would be painful regardless of which one you ended up choosing. Also, is it right to save someone\u2019s life knowing that the only way to do so will turn the person into a monster? You can imagine how the choices affected the character\u2019s lives, which leads to my next topic, which is on characterization. \\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s attractive about the characterization is that not only there is a wide range of personalities, but also that each recurring character\u2019s personality cannot be described simply by one sentence. The personality of each recurring character is multi-faceted and undergoes an extensive development.  For example, we can see that Saya grew from a soft crybaby to a strong female figure, due to the immense pressure laid on her. Also, we can see that Diva, who exhibited psychopathic traits, became more sympathetic and loving after a particular event (I don\u2019t want to spoil the event). You also have a main antagonist that has been mistreated for her entire life and you couldn\u2019t help but want to sympathize with her. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, Blood+ would be a bonus for you if you are into series with a sad and tense atmosphere. Some of the most tragic and emotive moments include a peaceful and loving family got shattered, the character that you got attached to died, and the nice guy, who provided major emotional support to the important characters, met his cruel end. By the way, I don\u2019t want to spoil anything but whatever happened to the main antagonist in the end is truly heartbreaking. However, I want to make the point that despite the tragedies in the series, the characters continue to maintain their positive energy and fight for their core values. \\n\\n\r\nNow I am going to talk about aspects that I wish the series could have done differently. First, the series is kind of long. For god\u2019s sake, it is 50 episodes! I think the series can certainly be made more compact. For instance, there are some unnecessary subplots in my opinion, such as the story of the Schiffs, which was just telling the same thing as the rest of the story and did nothing in terms of furthering the theme and the important characters. Second, the first 5 episodes are way too slow! I know most anime watchers use the first few episodes of the series to determine if it is worth watching, and if the first few episodes are shit, it will lose a lot of audience. Lastly, I was expecting way more blood and gore judging from the title. Before I watched the series, I was really excited and expected it to be around the same level of goriness as say Elfen Lied, Berserk, Claymore, Deadman Wonderland, Gantz, etc. But, its level of goriness is just around that of Shiki, Fullmetal Alchemist and Bleach. I suspect that there could be a number of audiences that came here for the blood (because of the title) but ended up being disappointed. \\n",

            "content": "I can start by state that this is one of my favorite anime ever. Only Hellsing Ultimate is slitghly better in the genre of vampire animes in my opinion. I dont want you to be miss led and belive that the shows are simuilar, they are quite different from each other. So ok, why is Blood+ one of my favorite anime ever? Let\u00b4s go down to that.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nAbsolutly fantastic! Its nothing new that humanity (and sometimes fellow vampires) is fighting against vampires, but this show does it right in every aspect. It takes this not so uncommen theme and makes something very orginial and deepof it. Then you put in global politiical and military conspiracys, good action, drama and wonderful character developemnts - than you how Blood+. It also have a bit of reverse harem done very right in it.The story are pretty dark and gets darker the further the show progressess, which in my opinion only makes it more realstic - there are no plot armor what so ever. I really enjoyed that the truth and background to the whole story, is revealed to you in the means of Saya getting her memories back - bit by bit. Yes, you get little more info than that, by watching other characters memories and converstions, but it slowly comes toghter beautifully. This made me keep high alert during every episode, due to cluse came here and there, sometimes you would had mist it if you didnt pay close attation. Blood+ really makes you think of the deeper nature of both humans and monsters. Whats drives us to do what we do, how much our environment effects us and how do we get through dark times, which may seem endless? And deep down we all want to be accepted and loved. The show is also much about to fight your true nature and have the strength to carry out your duty, even if may kill you. Could write a freaking novel about this story and why its  so awesome, but I gonna leave it here for now.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nIs absolutly great. As usal it has its flaws here and there, but are overall very beautiful. Character designs, colours, backgrounds is outstanding in my opinion. Action scense are very well exicuted, with fluid motions and feeling. You can often really feel the weight the fight has on the characters, and how it effects them emtionally during the fight and afterwards. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nOne word - AMAZING. Absolute one of the best soundtracks I ever heard in a anime (mayby otherwise as well). All music is calssical with live intrusment (they most have heired a whole orcester for this), and are perfectly adapted to which kind of scene it is and the mood of it. If you not gonna watch the show (which you should), i recommend that go at least listen to the soundtrack for the pure reason that it is beautiful. As I often do I watched the dubbed version. I wasnt the least dissiponited, the vocie actors was great. They really made a good job of breathing life into the characters and making them feel real.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nHere will I use one word again - OUTSTANDING. They all very personal, realistic and deep. Even most of the side characters feels like so much thought and time been put in to. \\n\\n\r\nSaya - Our MC, the girl who only remember the last year of her life. To follow her, was truley enjoyble and many times sad. She probaly has the most extental character development of all. From being a normal girl that goes to high school and enjoy her calm days with her adopted family (execept that she needs blood tranfusions) - only to discover that she is by no means a normal girl. That she has a dark past she cant remember (execpt for a very bloody nightmare), that she is the only one that can kill terrfing monsters, that people around her starts to dying and she is dragged in to something that big and complexe that an happy ending seems impossible. Saya is e very kind hearted person, which makes this story even sadder. To see how Saya has to adapt when memories and events is forced on to her, is nothing less then impressive. Because even do she may start out a bit frail and hesitent, but she grows stronger and stronger (both in mind and body). For the storys heroine she is brillaint. \\n\\n\r\nHaji - Sayas loyal companion. He is very quite and reclusive but than things starts to go to hell he is there and becomes a total badass. He dress in very tradtional cloths (like 1800 th) and carries a big case which contains his cello and Sayas katana. Its quite clear from the begning that he cares for Saya alot, even do she cant remember him. To watch their relationship to grow throughot the story was beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThere are so many more fantasic characters in this show, but i cant really go in to the depth with them all (novel warning agagin). But other great character which should at least be mentioned is Kai, Riku, David, Diva, Amshel and Solomon.They all contrbiute to the story in their own special way and are all very rememberble and special. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI was hooked from episode 1 through all the 50 episodes. Blood+ really gives you an emtional ride, sadness, excitement, hope and happiness. Absolutly enjoyed every second of it. Not even for a bit was i bored, confused (because you get the answers to most of the qusteions you may have given little time) or annoyed. This was pure bliss to me. I sat on edge in almost every episode and they manage to build up the mystery and story without it feeling rushed or slow pased. And the music.. as I mentioned before it is a masterpiece in its own.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nI gonna keep it short here. Then all above is put toghter a beautiful, complex and facinating story is told. MASTERPIECE is truly the word. I would recommed Blood+ to everyone. I thnik most people would find some elements in the show that they liked. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

A highly intellectual exercise in self-discovery, Blood+ doesn't shrink when it comes to tackling questions and issues no one likes to hear or talk about.  \r\nRife with metaphors on just how it is to be human in this day and age,  Blood+ is a story of tragedy and loss, of tolerance and insufferable cruelty, and of love and redemption. It's characters are chillingly introspective and easily blur the lines between what truly is good and evil.  While Blood+ is not immune to a number of cliches that creep up in an episode or two, these imperfections are morethan made-up for by it's novel plot and engaging characters. Any story that dares to question what it really means to be human deserves great praise in my book. Blood+ does just that; in spades.\\n\\n",

Saya, though a little bit more shy and frightened then when she was in Blood: The last vampire, is still a good character, added with some new character you didn't see in the movie. \r\nThe story/plot to this was alright and found it rather enjoyable through most of it (though some episodes nearly bored me.). The art and animation of it was a lovely different to the old time vampire moviesthat just have it in dark senery all the time 'twitch', this brings a good concept of light as well as darkness blended in together like a perfect cup of vanilla and carmel tea.\\n\\n\r\nSound was alright and the opening/closing songs went almost well with the anime as well as its graphics. Though I did not enjoy seeing Saya so.. uhm what's the right word, girlsh I was still able to add her to my favs, even though her attitude got down graded abit, the other characters were a nice change instead of just focusing on one person. \\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this was quite high for a vampire anime. I have to say that seeing Diva and Saya together was really brought an amusing smirk to my lips, as well as the fresh way of blood splatter. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give it a nine. It was good but like I said some bits of it bored me to death, some was odd and I found it quite annoying.",

            "content": "Blood+ was my first step to more mature anime. I saw it back when I was about 15, when Naruto, Bleach, and DBZ were by far my favorite anime. And after watching Blood+, it completely overshadowed them. I always had a love of dark, sadistic, and stylish things, which is exactly what Blood+ is. The story was dark, it had a strong vampire based storyline, and it wasn't just about getting stronger and stopping evil, there is lust, revenge, depression, ect. The artwork was at the time really good, but that was 2005 I think, now-a-days it could be considered decent. The music was hit-or-miss,some of the OP and ED I loved, but some of them I despised. The characters worth pointing out IMO are Saya (protagonist) and Haji (most stylish sidekick ever). Haji is by far the best character in the show, and it doesn't take long to realize this, his loyalty to Saya is absolute, and he his style is really awesome. He throws knives, has a demon hand, and beats enemies down with a cello case, all while maintaining his \"swagger\". Overall, the main flaw of this anime would have to be the fact that at times it did get pretty boring, there would be episodes of complete build-up, which weren't exciting at all, but after about episode 39, it becomes a complete rollercoaster ride. Overall, this is one of the better vampire based anime I have seen, although the side-kick steals the story, it still is a pretty good anime.",

            "content": "One Word: Disappointing\r\nShort Review: When I read the story line and character bios for this anime I had high expectations for Blood+ but sadly they weren't met. The art and sound were the only two things that I thought were pretty good but everything else was lacking. The love triangle between Saya, Haji and Kai was plain annoying with these two guys chasing after a girl who constantly second guesses herself. The story felt like it dragged on and could have definitely been told better in 20-26 episodes. Lastly the action scenes were painful to watch because usually a character gets stronger after facing multipleobstacles and trials which enables them to be strong enough to face their final problem. In this show, however, our main character starts off at her peak and gets weaker throughout the entire show winning her battles through pure luck. This is definitely not worth the 50 episode commitment.",

            "content": "I must say that I did not like the original movie Blood the Last Vampire, and I seen it a few times trying to find the overall brilliance. Sadly for me, it was nothing more than an exercise in advanced animation techniques. I praised it for very sharp attention to detail in regards to the visuals. However, I thought it was very close to worthless in other areas. The story left a lot to be explored and when I heard about Blood+ being a 50 episode series based on Saya; I figured here goes that missing part to the story. Contrary to what some folkswould have you believe. Blood+ is not a sequel to the original movie, and the creators made no attempt to tie the two together. This is a separate story that examines Saya from a different perspective and explores her origin. \\n\\n\r\nThe first area I must hit on are the production values. In regards to the visuals, Blood+ is very beautiful with some very fluid animation frame by frame. These visuals are very close to top notch for a TV series. The animation during the battles are very good with nice choreography at times and the scenes can be violent and brutal, with lots of sword play resulting in dismemberments.\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are simply gorgeous as they effectively combine with the CG. The ocean, river, and snow laden backdrops are outstanding, and it's the little things that appealed to my senses like high speed trains going by in the night time. \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are also very pretty, and I thought it was a plus that the old school girl uniform wasn't being used to death to give anime perverts something to constantly drool over. Saya is seen in many different types of clothes, and most of the time she is very conservative. The fan service is kept pretty low and this is not something you will hear me complain about ever. Some of the villains look great too with some of the more powerful chiropterans having freakish appearances.  \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also very well composed with some of the dramatic scenes being supported by a slow paced, melancholic piano backdrop. The opening and ending credits have some pretty nice themes as well and they do change later on.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the heavy action feel of the original movie. Blood+ is actually a lot more character driven. Now don't get me wrong, there are several action scenes with some good sword fighting and heavy gore; but the characters are the main focus and I consider them a mixed bag for the most part. Saya is heavily developed as the story deals a lot more with her human side, and although she's a very flawed heroine in regards to toughness. She's difficult to truly dislike. Additional characters possess heavy potential for drama but most of the side characters are nothing more than mere stereotypes, and even though some may have a bit of depth it makes several of them no less annoying. Fortunately thanks to at least one key character death I can't say they were that bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe series features a great amount of suspense and the viewer would more than likely be gripped to the screen while waiting for the next revelation. The plot follows Saya as she begins to exterminate the creatures called Chiropterans. Along the way, there are certain factions introduced and the lead antagonist is of course revealed with this character playing a huge role in Saya's origin, as well as things moving forward.\\n\\n\r\nBlood+ is decent at best and had potential to be far better. However, the series has some pacing issues because it juggles many side stories. There are way too many side plots taking place and finding time for all these events plus character interactions were a lot of times distracting. I think several characters and situations could have been left on the cutting room floor, and this would have helped the story move a lot more fluid. I understand that a lot of these things played into Saya's character development, but this was one of those cases of too much character development, and as a result, it gave away Saya's actions in the final cut. The foreshadowing was so strong to the point where it heavily took away from the \"deciding moment\". \\n\\n\r\nI praised the series for its use of drama, but due to the obvious I felt that a certain dramatic moment wasn't as strong as it should have been. In addition, some of these elements began to repeat themselves over and over as if the point wasn't made clear the first couple of times. I think these segments will differ from person to person all depending on how much they bought into the characters. Since I didn't really care for all of them some of the segments really didn't appeal to me much.\\n\\n\r\n I will give this series credit for tonal consistency. There are some brief moments of comedy injected, but it's not the least bit forced nor does it distract from the serious nature of the content unlike Hellsing Ultimate, which is heavily damaged by its shifts in comedic moments. When looking at the style of Blood+ compared to that I have to say it's well written.\\n\\n\r\nBlood+ could have been an amazing anime. It's definitely far from a bad title, but due to several issues in its storyline it just comes off as an average title. I didn't feel like it was a waste of time, yet I wish back then I didn't buy completely into the hype and simply put it off for awhile. In closing, I recommend this to most anime fans, those whom loved the original movie, and even those that hated it. \\n\\n\r\nHighs: Production values, some interesting characters, ending\\n\\n\r\nLows: Pacing issues that really hurts main narrative",

            "content": "Story: Blood + posseses a storyline of incredible quality. Although not having many plot twists, they  are fierce and shocking beyond belief. The story can be somewhat predictable at times for the seasoned otaku but the parts of the story that were predictable were intended to be that way o give the viewer a sense of security. In addition to predicatble moments in plot the suspensful ones more than compansate for it. Lastley, the ending to this anime is immaculate. The creators provided an ending that the viewer wanted instead of one that the viewer had to create themselfs or were extreamly dissapointed with.\r\nArt:The artwork in Blood + could be described as good but not the best out there. By no streach of the imagination does the artwork compare to the unparalleled work found in Clannad/AS or Kanon(2006), but does posses artwork on par with Deathnote. Deathnote combines anime style art and the real appearance of people giving anime characters a more human /realistic look, and Blood + did this as well. The animation is fluid with and has great detail. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Sound was not the bread and butter for this anime. I did not really notice alot of the soundtrack while watching the aniem prolly because I was so absorbed in the story. Anyway, a soundtrack has to be memorable in order to be considered great. A great example of a fantastic sound track would be Clannad. The redeming quality for sound though were the opening and closing themes. I have all the themes on my Itunes they were so good. Having artists like Jinn doing an opening theme will really make the feel of the anime more nastalgic. I would say that this anime has  not so great sound trak but the opening and closing themes are it's saving grace.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters in this anime are perfect. The creators went into depth with the characters they needed to and shrowded others in mystery for the same purpose. When the viewer cares about the well ebing of the other characters then that anime has amazing characters and the creators did a great job. plus, the protagonist's development blew me away. Saya took a complete 180 in the first season and slowly reverted back to her old self. Also, the viewer will remember the entire cast without effort meaning that if the characters were that memorable they were done well. The overall character development is second to noe as well. No anime that I have seen has ever developed their characters better than Blood +.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: To say that this anime is a masterpeice is more than an understatement. Having a perfect story, characters, and near perfect art with a decent soundtrack makes Blood + the series to watch. i watched this sries in six days because I was so absorbed in it. The plot has a perfect pace and characters are exposed at the right time and given the correct amount of depth. By no means is this the best anime out there but it is a must watch.\\n",

            "content": "For someone who has not seen Blood: The Last Vampire yet, it may seem a bit confusing as to the storyline, although the story is only loosely based off of it. For the idea of it being a Vampire show, this is not. It has no actual vampire although it has some variation of a \u2018vampire-like\u2019 monsters. It doesn\u2019t really explain much about the main characters and why they really were the main characters in the first place. It starts out with Saya and her friend seeming to be way to close then just friends. Saya pretty much lost her memory and goes to bloodtransfusions often. As she does all this, she searches for her memories. Then all hell breaks loose that same first episode. WARNING! There is a little bit of spoilers in this review.\\n\\n\r\n There is a saying that goes around the show of \u2018whatever will be, will be\u2019 but yet, the show does not really keep to this. Other interesting things is the fact that the monsters in this are similar to vampires and yet, they are not exactly like vampires. It actually feels pretty interesting in that sense for it gives it a feel all its own (and yes, I know there are a couple animes out there with almost the same feel. This one at least tries to be different though). Much of the story is rather sad and dark, with only a little bit of comedy what doesn\u2019t stand out well.\\n\\n\r\nWe will talk about Saya first. Saya is just like a normal girl with a big secret. She is actually not human, but yet not like the monsters (Chiropteran) she fights. From the moment she tastes Hagi\u2019s blood, she remembers things about her past that were sealed away when she fell asleep 30 years before. Its really hard talking about her and the other characters for it can really bring about spoilers for the show.\\n\\n\r\nHagi is her Chevalier and only person who have been alive almost as long as Saya has. He was bought from his parents as though he was a piece of livestock with the hope he would \u2018breed\u2019 with Saya like they were animals. I actually really do with that the two would get together and find happiness because they are a rather cute couple. He\u2019s the rather silent type almost all knowing and truly cares about Saya.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a deep connection between Saya and her adopted family. It\u2019s so great that when Saya leaves, they end up trying to follow her to help her as much as they can. It\u2019s really heartfelt and will bring tears to your eyes if you\u2019re rather sentimental about this type of stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is actually rather beautiful, looking like it was done almost perfectly. At times, the scenes are rather dark and give a rather horror based look about the show, and then it will actually lighten up to make it a little more cheerful. As the story gets going, the darker it gets and the more fight scenes happen. I know this is a little strange to say, but in Anime terms, Saya actually does look a lot like a Korean. Other characters are a bit interesting, though there really wasn\u2019t much that stood out. I love how they created Hagi in the rather quiet and mysterious type of character. He has a very Victorian feel about him everywhere he goes.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is beautiful, mostly orchestra related and captures the sad moods rather well.  The voices are actually pretty good, though some of the supporting characters sound a bit off. They made the perfect voice for Hagi as Crispin Freeman. He\u2019s perfect for the mysterious style of guy. Saya on the other hand sounds a bit whiny at times though, and it gets a little odd.",

            "content": "An amazing anime that can never be forgotten. It always keeps the viewer coming back for more.\r\nBlood+ packs all sorts of genres into one anime, without it feeling packed. You've got your romance, violence, drama and tragedy all in one. Equally balanced and favoring to every kind of person. \r\nEvery episode has a cliffhanger and not in a bad way. The ending of one episode makes your mind fill with possibilities and questions and forces you to watch the next episode. That's what I call entertainment. \r\nAt first, you might think this anime is just about Saya Otonashi, a teenage girl suffering from memory lossliving with an adoptive family on the small island of Okinawa, Japan. Who then comes upon monsters that can only be killed by her blood. The end. That's all show will ever be about. No conclusion or back stories..\\n\\n\r\n BUT NO...!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nIt is the entire opposite! So much that you could never even imagine happens and it juts completely blows your mind...Blood+ has so much to it and is beautifully written. I love it so much and I highly recommend it to anyone that loves multiple genres and is okay with some blood and gore...!\u2665\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nAmazing. Simply amazing. There are so many things that you never saw coming and so many back stories that you learn about later that all add up to the main point of the anime!\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI love the art and character designs along with the clothing designs. Another sequel to the Blood franchise, Blood-C, has better animation, but Blood+'s story outweighs the minor animation issues by far!\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe dubbing isn't that great for some characters. I think Haji's voice actor, Crispin Freeman could have put more emotion into Haji's voice sometimes but overall the dubbing is great.The sound effects are perfect.:)\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nEach character has their own individual personality and that is easily shown. Many people can relate to a character.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nLOVE IT. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. It is not exactly 1st on my list but not second either...1st and a half? haha Code Geass still holds its place in 1st.\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n100/10!!! Yes, one hundred out of 10 haha... For anyone who loves a bit of each genre in one anime and for someone who is okay with blood and gore. Its not disgusting gore or anything. Just lots and lots of blood~\u2665\\n\\n\r\nBlood's a pretty color.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Although the general idea, the basic character design and even parts of the story looked promising, i can't bring myself to really like Blood+.\r\nThe layout for most of the characters is well done, they contrast each other nicely and cover pretty much any attitude known from modern animes/mangas. Ranging from egoistic, funny, morally over desperate, lovable, childish, weak to downright evil, fanatic  and insane. \r\nAnd there are a lot of characters, by covering any major concievable aspect, the anime fails to give each of them a compelling background-story or enough \"prime-time\" to fully develope. Most of them dont have necessary influence on the mainstory.\\n\\n\r\nThe first part of the story unfolds the background of the main protagonist Saya in a lengthy of \"The Twelve Kingdoms\" reminding stilistic way, the later consists of a standard apocalyptic scenario carried by the antagonism of Saya and her counterpart Diva. By the time the anime ends over a dozen substories have been created and most of them  wont be finished. The end is horribly designed and features \"deus ex machina\" in all its glory. Also the entire story could have been told in around half the episodes, without any noticable loss.\\n\\n\r\nBut my main problem with the anime is not it's story. Blood+ is completly, fundamentally illogical. Each anime has a set of rules under which it operates. \\n\\n\r\nLike \"vampires burn if they go into the sun\", \"Shinigami can't die, they just go back to the realm of dead\" etc. Blood+ violates his own set with a to me yet unkown consistency. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire story is based on a fundamental rule \"The only one beeing able to kill the vampire-like-creatures is Saya\", it adheres to this rule for just a few episodes, than ignores it, states it again (and keeps stating it until nearly the end), gets proven wrong (severing the head/burning works just fine), but ignores this by saying humans are not able to do this, although they have already done it. This continues by proclaiming those creatures can't kill each other, which gets also silently changed. New rules are introduced, old ones are forgotten, reawakend and changed just to proceed the storyline. In my oppinion unacceptable.",

So please people, be tolerant\r\nOK, first of all this anim\u00e9 was recommended by the MAL community as a similar one to Claymore, so I decided to give it a shot.\r\nI have to say that this anim\u00e9 has the best character development of all. One can never say, what\r\n the characters are going to do next, mainly because they can be seen sometimes as controversial. I have to say that I was a little disappointed with the level of detail in some scenes, but overall the animationis superb. The music is the best part about this anim\u00e9 - if you are into opera or sad cello concertos, be sure to watch this one.\\n\r\nNow, the plot: The anim\u00e9 doesn't follow only the protagonist, but also has some parallel stories which enriches the whole experience. For me, at least, there we're a lot of open questions which found their answers only near the end of the show. One more thing, the last six or seven slow down the pace a little bit finishing the parallel stories I spoke of earlier. The finale is both dramatic and optimistic, it doesn't leave unanswered questions but yet manages to convince us that the story will continue and the viewer will certainly be satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to sum up: If you like drama-packed anim\u00e9s with kick-ass protagonists and meticulously written plot, and also that bloody fighting scenes have a charm of their own, then this anim\u00e9 is just for you!\\n\\n\r\nAgain, as I've said, this is my first review, so constructive criticism is more the welcome, but spare me your unmotivated anger.\\n\\n\r\nBoris Yanchev",

            "content": "At first glance it seems like a typical gore anime with vampires in it and plenty of blood just as the title suggest, but its not all there is to it. At the start of the series I didn't know where this was going; I mean the typical high school girl everyday life thing did not much match with the title. But I digress, as the series progresses the main protagonist Saya and Haji, and her family are thrust in a torrent of tragedies one after the other. And this was one of the best things that this series have to offer, the character development.I love how the characters learn to cope with their losses in their own way and as well as how the anime make us sympathize for the main antagonist, Diva. Saya and Diva are foils to one another and it was entertaining to see the two going after one another's throat and unraveling their causes of disputes.\\n\\n\r\nAnother one of the great things this anime has to offer its is music. Yes, both the opening and closing does great justice to the seriousness of the anime and compliments them. I also want to applaud the soundtrack and theme music of each character as they are extremely memorable: to Diva's song to Haji's cello and the epic songs when a chiropteran battles in place. It keeps the adrenalin in tact all right,\\n\\n\r\nTo me, this was one of the very well-done animation of the 2000s. I watched this in my early teens and the animations looks unique and pleasing to the eyes. The action mixed with the drama creates a whole new dimensions of entertainment if you don't mind the blood. This is a great gem found in the piles of vampires stories that didn't made you quench because of how cliches it was or how mindless is the plot.\\n\\n\r\nBlood + has a great balanced of gore, drama and action that makes you looking for more of this roller coaster ride. If you want a refreshing heart-throb and a little blood, this is the anime for you. Just a warning: prepare a tissue cause I certainly did need it.",

            "content": "Blood+ is an anime about vampires and one special vampire hunting them down.  I can\u2019t say I haven\u2019t seen that before.  I have seen worse vampire anime and definitely worse vampire stories in general.  However, at the same time, there are better vampire anime out there as well like Vampire Hunter D or Hellsing.  Hell, why stop at anime.  Watch stuff like the Blade movies.  This series seems very much like Blade in a lot of ways.  You have a main character, Saya (in this case a woman), who is a powerful and special vampire (supposedly) who wieldsa cool-looking sword and slays other vampires.  I can tell you that Blade could kick Saya\u2019s ass any day of the week.  I would much rather watch Blade and Blade 2 than this anime.  I would watch this over Blade Trinity but that\u2019s not saying much.  There will be some SPOILERS from here on so be warned. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s get the good points out of the way.  Firstly, the art and animation is good for the most part.  For an anime that came out in 2005 the visuals are good.  The animation during the fights was usually fluid and some of the action seasons are decent mainly ones involving the Shiva lies.  The music is also good.  All the openings are great and will get you hyped until you realize what you\u2019re watching.  The ending songs are okay and the score does its job.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main issues I have with this anime is the characters.  I find most if not all of them boring, uninteresting, or just whiny.  If you like the characters that\u2019s fine, but I was not invested in any of them.  At first I was invested in Saya\u2019s character but as the series progressed I became less and less interested.  Many people think Saya is a great character and a very strong female lead, but I did not see that really.  Saya would not be in my top 10, 20, or even top 30 lists of best female characters in anime.  \\n\\n\r\nShe\u2019s not badass.  Her fights are honestly pretty dull.  Plus, she almost always has to get saved by her Shiva lie Haji, her brother Kai, Solomon, or somebody else.  Haji does most of the work in fights and Saya then has the finishing blow.  She is also whiny and indecisive.  I could forgive it at the beginning because she is still adjusting to everything.  However, as the series went on her indecisiveness grated on me.  \\n\\n\r\nDiva is even worse.  She is built up as the main villain and a massive threat, but she wasn\u2019t really.  She wasn\u2019t that great of a fighter and her personality and motivation was really weird.  At first she wanted to kill Saya, then she wanted Riku but then kills him,, then it seems like she wanted to sing, then at the end I guess what she wanted was a family.  It is really confusing.  Did the writers want us to feel sympathy toward her at the end?  She tried to kill Saya multiple times, she killed Saya\u2019s real father, killed Riku, and took on Riku\u2019s appearance as a final insult.  She gets no sympathy from me.  If she did really want a family then that\u2019s a rather weak motivation for the main villain.  \\n\\n\r\nDiva\u2019s Shiva lies were more of the main villains than she was and they seemed stronger too.  They are the ones with the grand scheme to take over the world and replace humans with Chiropterans, not Diva.  Even though Saya and Diva are supposed to be the head vampires their servants seem stronger than they are judging by what I\u2019ve seen each of them do compared to Saya and Diva.  I know Saya and Diva\u2019s blood is deadly to them, but from an ability and combat efficiency standpoint they seem better.  The Shiva lies get all the good fights.  I am never hyped to see Saya and Diva fight.  I always wait for Haji or the other Shiva lie to come fight or fight each other.  The final fight between Saya and Diva is pathetic.  While that was happening you had Haji fighting Diva\u2019s head Shiva lie and that was a much better fight.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, it is so boring.  This anime is fifty episodes in length and it could have easily been half that if not even less.  It really shows in the pacing, which is slow and tiring.  There are some episodes where barely anything happens.  The story isn\u2019t big or complicated enough to warrant being as long as it is.  The plot is pretty straightforward and there are really no twists or turns.  Diva\u2019s Shiva lies want to replace humanity with Chiropterans as top of the food chain and Saya and her group has to stop them.  You could\u2019ve easily resolved that in a 25 episode series or even a 12 or 13 episode series.  \\n\\n\r\nPlus, there\u2019s the whole love triangle between Saya, Haji, and Solomon (Diva\u2019s Shiva lie) which falls into Twilight territory.  Okay, it\u2019s not that bad but it does give off that Twilight vibe to me, which isn\u2019t a good thing.  People give this anime\u2019s successor, Blood-C, a lot of shit.  That series, while not perfect, is better than this.  Blood-C is much shorter so the pacing is better, the action is better I think, the lead heroine does more, and there is no Twilight-esk love story in there.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Blood+ soap opera making as a vampire anime.  The action scenes involving the Shiva lie are decent but the rest is just dull.  It\u2019s too long and the pacing is super slow.  The main character, Saya, is boring, indecisive, and not that strong overall.  The other characters aren\u2019t any better.  The villains are weak especially Diva.  Her motivation is all over the map, she didn\u2019t come off as this badass ultimate villain, and she doesn\u2019t really do much.  Her servants seem more like the main villains.  They have more screen time than she does.  They are the one that have the grand scheme in mind while diva just seems to be just going along with it.  The only characters that are somewhat worth anything are Haji and Solomon.  As I said previously there is much better vampire fiction out there.  It is definitely not the worst but I\u2019d skip it.                    \\n",

            "content": "An incredible show, an anime with a little bit of everything. Honestly, this ought to be one of the classics which I'd recommend to any otaku rookie next to FMA and Death Note. It's really got it all; from emotional roller coasters over eye-opening life lessons to sexy waifus battling mosters and superhumans with big swords-it's all in there, and it all blends incredibly well. Plot progression is its strongest aspect in my opinion; it rarely spends too much time on a scene that doesn't entirely captivate your interest but never feels rushed either. While keeping that balance, it manages to combine very mature themesfrequently centered around the experiences, psychology and resulting ideology of the MC with spot-on comedy and light-hearted moments from the side characters.\\n\r\nWithout delwing into spoiler territory though, please keep in mind that this show is everything but a comedy show and doesn't exactly make your day with the scarily realistic bleakness and struggles of the intriguing personalities of both the main and side cast. This show made depressed me tear up a fair bit more often than fall out my seat laughing, you have been warned.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, here's some well-intentioned advice: Be careful with your attachments ;) \\n\\n\r\nBonus points: the OP were so good, I skipped them less times then not (coming from somebody who oftentimes skips the plot before the opening out of sheer boredom). It is truly pure joy.",

            "content": "Such an underrated anime! I have probably watched this show around 3 times, and everytime I see it in a slightly different light. Sometimes western influence ruins an anime, but in this anime, it really fits. The various settings which also partially mark the start and end of each arc really helps add to the excitement of the series. Saya's personality does seem a bit robotic at times, but the other characters like Haji, Kai, and Diva really help shape her as the story progresses. If you're looking for a series with a bit of action, drama, and adventure, this is a good match. Itis, however, a bit gorey and mature, and also contains tragedy down the road, so if you're not prepared for that, then I would not suggest this for the light of heart. The OPs and EDs are also super great if you're looking for more music. Overall, if you're interested in a girl recovering her past and saving the rest of the world from disgusting creatures, Blood + is pretty great.",

It was just as great as I remembered. \r\nThe story is amazing and is told in 50 episodes, so it\u2019s a long one, but they couldn\u2019t have made this show great if they pushed it into 24 or fewer episodes. It needed all of these episodes. I know some people may think some episodes would be boring considering the amount, but I know every episode has something to tell, never making me lose interest. \r\nThe art fits the anime well, nothing to complain about. It\u2019s an older art style,but to me, it doesn\u2019t matter as long as it fits and the animation goes smooth. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are outstanding. The main characters are well written and have a tremendous amount of character development due to the situations they go through. Of course, the length of the anime had something to do with it as well. \\n\r\nEven the side characters they encounter have well-written personalities and are not easily tossed aside from your memory. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is worth all 50 episodes and I recommend it to those who want to watch a long well-written story. I can assure you I went through this in a week. \\n",

If you want a bad-ass female protagonist, this is not the anime for you. With nil character development and a core concept that can't decide whether to make her 'normal' (yet goall the way to, god forbid, any sense of reality in her reactions) or a fighter. you're left with imo, the single MOST annoying female character ever.\\n\r\nAnd it's unfortunate because the plot had the potential for a LOT of solid character growth.\\n\\n\r\nIt's like they wanted to capture a sort of nuanced take on the personality aspect of 'normal' girl who is a god chara w amnesia, so they focus a lot of screen minutes per episode on her 'emotions', yet fall so far short of the mark, those minutes only exacerbate the ridiculousness. \\n\\n\r\nIt's also like they want to milk the 'mystery' aspect as much as possible so they end up having every conversation inanely cryptic, even among those in the 'know' and those outside, and then make the characters ok with it, when even 1% reality would have had them respond, \"hold up, wtf are you talking about.' Like we get it, you want to create suspense, but ffs, have your human characters behave even a bit like humans??\\n\\n\r\nBack to the useless, pathetic crybaby who constantly insists she can handle it to the point of trying to 'protect' her brother, but invariably ends up crying 'i can't, i can't' when faced with any danger, irrespective of how many people die and suffer around her, when she can protect them so easily. While it is understandable in the beginning because it's not easy for a 'normal' girl to up and become that brutal or violent w zero misgivings, by the 7857465th time it gets reeeeeaally old. \\n\r\nTill it makes me wonder why the Red Shield is wasting fuel on carting her from place to place. \\n\r\nWith the Lycee school arc she seemed to have gotten her act together, but in the climax at the Plantation she went back to being perfectly useless when required only to kill her own comrades in the end w/out even taking out Karl. I gave it 14 episodes because of the reviews but i CANNOT take it any longer. \\n\\n\r\n100/10 save yourself a lot of frustration and do NOT watch.",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that it's rare that I give an anime -especially one that I watched that was a dub- a 10. \r\nYears ago when it aired on Adult Swim, I had only seen bits and pieces of it. Unfortunately, what I had seen, was the very last episode. I never heard much about Blood+, but I decided I would give the show a chance and watch the entire thing from beginning to end. SO glad that I did.\r\nStory:\r\n10/10\r\nOk, yes, it's about vampires. But only to an extent. The actual 'vampires' are huge, ugly, monstrous, and about as far from human asyou can get. With all the vampire craze going on at the moment, it was nice to see scary, in-humane blood-sucking beasts for a change. No sparkly crap here! With that out of the way, the story is about a high school girl with no memory of the previous year, has to get frequent blood transfusions, and can eat enough to sustain an army. She was adopted into a family with two foster brothers, Kai and Riku. Everything is going great until she notices a man playing the cello on the streets for a crowd. After getting a flash of her memory, encountering a mounstrous beast that tries to kill her, and meeting that mysterious cello player, her entire world changes. \\n\r\nThis anime gives you clues and leaves you guessing until the very last episode. Never a dull moment. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSaya's hair pissed me off to no end. I HATE her hair. She is a beautiful girl with a butch cut. Haji had narrow, beady eyes that made him looked stoned throughout the anime. Other than that, the art and animation was flawless. The fight scenes were fantastic and no cencorship on the blood and gore, which was actually refreshing for a change. I mean, this show is about vampires, so there has to be blood and death. Yay for no cencorship!\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nI tried watching the Japanese version first, but was frequently pissed off by the pronounciation of the American names. After the 10th episode, I reluctantly switched to the dub, and boy was I surprised. Good dubs are hard to find, and Blood+ has one of the best dubs out there. The voice actors matched the characters to a tee, and they even did the accents of the French and Russian characters. The only voice I had a problem with was Riku's. He was supposed to be about 13 and he sounded like a five year old.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSaya: Saya is one of the only female leads that can kick butt and stand up for herself. She grows and matures throughout each episode and is willing to die to protect those who she loves. Even though she has to shoulder the burden of purifying the world of the Chiropterans, she remains strong. \\n\\n\r\nHaji: Haji was a great main character, even though he rarely showed any form of emotion. He is devoted to Saya and has promised to follow her until the end. Not much to say about him, aside from that. He's cool, but that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nKai: Kai is one of my favorite characters in the show. He had the most character development and was actually useful from time to time. Loved him to death.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAction, history, vampires, fighting, blood, romance, angst, comedy. What more could you ask for in an anime? This show ROCKED and I'm proud to have it listed under my favorites.",

At first I was hesitant to watch this, but since I first saw promotion video made by adultswim, I decided why not give it a try. The plot was really mind twisting, there were mostly a lot of feedback of Saya's memories and times where they story just started to drift off with other characters point of view. But this made the story much more interesting. The music was the amazing since it fitted to the fighting scenes and not to mention the mood of thestory. The way the Diva sang gave me chills while watching this even reading the manga. Though it was long and the romance was mostly a cliffhanger, this gave a chance for the story it self to unravel the truth of Saya and why she exist in the world. The characters devotion to other characters strike a homerun in the plot, especially Haji and Saya relationship of a chevalier and a chiropteran queen surely created an irresistible romance.\"Nankurunaisa\" meaning it'll be alright gave hope, enlightening the story with a memorable ending.",

It was the first anime that I went and found on my own, without referral from friends, and endeavored to finish... And it was 100% worth it. \r\nA lot of people I know who don't like it are the ones who have seen an episode or two on adult swim, and simply can't find any words other than WHAT THE FUCK. Honestly, if I'd been introduced to this anime in a similar way, I'd do the same thing. I hated bleach for a long time because every time I saw an episodeit was them running around and looking for each other in soul society and I didn't know wtf was happening. Point being; THERE'S PLOT HERE, PEOPLE. You gotta watch it from the beginning, and will only be able to thoroughly enjoy it if you watch it to the end. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe two highlights for me are that they a) don't focus on the romantic aspects, but touch on them just enough to leave you crying at the end, and b) the people who made this had no fear when it comes to killing off characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs far as darker, plot-heavy anime go, I'd dare to put this above Code Geass. The art is excellent, proportionate and very smoothly animated, and there isn't any of that over-dramatic flashy crap whenever there's a plot twist that seems to scream \"PLOT TWIST! DID YOU SEE IT?!?\". \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I gave it a nine, because its maturity and well-rounded plot create a thrilling experience for the viewer as they try to guess what's going to happen next. I wouldn't give it a ten, because there are parts that seem a bit unnecessary or long, but in some ways they just make pushing through them to see the outcome that much more rewarding.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Well, I am popping my cherry with reviews. Blood+ this is a magnificent Anime, it has some good action, a deep twisting plot (though I am sure someof you will say it is a recycled plot, I assure you it is not), Deep, and when I say deep I mean FUCKING DEEP characters. There is something about an anime that can let you connect with more than one character on an emotional level.\r\nThe anime revolves around Saya Otonashi, an high school girl who is a hemopheliac who has to get blood transfusions regularlly. She meets a mysterious man who plays a Chello who saves herlife from a beast in her school. This mysterious man gives Saya a sword with a portion of the blade reversed whith a vein for her blood to travel down and through the blade. Apparently her (Saya) blood is key to destroying these \"beasts\".\\n\\n\r\nAs far as story goes, Some of you may think, \"Wow, another conspiracy theory against the USA, BORING recylcled plot.\" but I assure you if you invest your time in the first 4-5 episodes you will be drawn into the series until the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very mature, there is a lot of bood, the muzzle flashes from the gunshots don't look very animated, they look more like big lens flares and supernova effects. The detail of many of the characters are very well done, though overall it seems as though the artist(s) were holding back, for example the intermissions sequences show a little bit more of the talent that I believe should have been applied throught the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound isnt anything spectacular, it isn't bad but it isnt great. I bumped my score of it up to a 7 instead of a 5 because I absolutely love the opening and closing themes.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters, oh boy isnt this a topic... Saya, David, Kai, Riku, Haji the list goes on. These characters have such a deep earthly connection to each other that (at least I could) it leaves veiwes able to connect with them and feel a part of the problems and emotions directed throughout the entire series. When Saya remembers her past one the day at the Zoo during *unnamed character*'s birthday made me feel as though I was in Saya's shoes, I actually felt really guilty, as if it was MY fault that the events had occcured.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, hrmmm I dont know how to put it other than, everytime I finished an episode I felt compelled to watch the next, and the next, and the next, so on and so forth. I would say that this is one of the most enjoyable anime's out.\\n\\n\r\nI know there are going to be a lot of people who disagree with me and my thoughts, but I also think that there are a lot of people who are going to agree. If you have a differing opinion than me then please write your own review.\\n\\n\r\nThanks everyone ^^",

            "content": "For some reason, I always come back to this and search for similar anime like Blood+. \r\nMaybe it's because Blood+ has a lot going on yet the story is pretty straightforward. Blood+ takes you on a journey rather than an adventure. The journey makes you see a lot of things and honestly by the end, you won't even remember how it all started because so much has happened in so little time. I call it a journey instead of an adventure because I feel like journeys are more about people and adventures are more about the events. There are probably fewer shows on journeys thanadventures, but there are even fewer shows on journeys that are actually adventurous. \\n\r\nMaybe that's why I find Blood+ kind of special compared to other vampire, gory, military, or action packed shows. To say Blood+ is a show about vampires is entirely wrong. It has pretty much a little of everything. But surprising, it's not messy. I personally prefer simple and focused stories, not really because I don't like adventure packed shows. I just think one One Piece or one Gintama is enough, unless you can give me something greater. Simple stories are easier to bring out the meanings, and simple stories are easier to stay focused. Of course, they tend to get boring if you have a bunch of stereotyped characters. Not even the most outrageous situation can save those type of shows. \\n\r\nGoing back to Blood+. It's definitely not a simple story and it definitely did not come out of Jump, but it's not like your average mecha or vampire series either. Vampires, especially blood, in different relationships and situations mean differently. Blood+ pretty much weaved all the different meanings of blood together in a presentable form, which I think is brilliant. some of you like me won't think anything special about it even after finishing it. But, maybe like me, you'll come back after half a year or so and savor what it offered. \\n",

I have to say that I didn't expect much, but the more I watched I learned to understand the flow of the story and I was hooked!  It's a must watch!!  \r\nArt:  9/10:  The art was wasn't unique, but it was great! \r\nSound:  9/10:  I always watch my shows in Japanese version with English subtitles so it sounded wonderful!  There was a few things that got meoff, like David-san's voice, however, the more I watch the anime, I learned to accept it.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10:  I love the character development.  You don't have a linear character.  What you get are characters that have human qualities...Saya, for example shows weakness and she struggles with it.  what I do love about her is that she dealt with it.  Most characters I loved, even the Sif were amazing (although I hated them at first).  You just gotta watch it to see how wonderful they all are!!  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  10/10 I really enjoyed this show!  I watched it morning and night!  I didn't even eat just so I can watch the ending of it.  I usually skip episodes if I am not really into it, especially if it's long like B+, but for this show, you just cannot skip.  Each episodes is relevant to the next, and therefore, skipping one might get you confuse!  \\n\\n\r\nOverall:  10/10  I really love this show!  At first I didn't really like it cuz I am not a fan of vampire-like shows, but this one kick-ass! :D",

            "content": "Saya Otonashi is a seemingly normal teenage girl living in a loving, adopted family. Though she has only lived with them for a year and can remember nothing of her past, her father George and brothers Kai and Riku take care of her and have given her the chance at a normal life. Things change quickly, however, when strange creatures appear in Okinawa, and soon Saya finds herself face-to-face with a blood-sucking monster. Narrowly escaping death, she is saved by a mysterious man named Hagi, and even more surprisingly, is able to fight and kill these creatures. As the incidence of attacks on civilians bythe monsters increases, Saya is forced into cooperation with the mysterious Red Shield organization. What awaits her is a journey from which neither she, her family, nor the world can escape. In the process of fighting to protect humanity, she will learn the dark secrets of her past.\\n\\n\r\nBlood+ is a success from the start. The viewer is quickly drawn into a world of urgency, suspense, and uncertainty, all centering around a loving family and seemingly loving teenage girl. Blood makes a habit of having horrific twists and turns, and it is exactly this approach which makes the series such a pleasure to watch. What's more, unlike so many other anime that have achieved success abroad, there is no real sense of progress or powering-up by the protagonist. For virtually the entire show there is a sense of despair as it seems that Saya and her allies pose no real threat to their powerful enemy and the worldwide network that it has established. Further, the series avoids typical pitfalls such as filler episodes and inappropriate length: at 50 episodes, the duration felt perfect. As for animation, the visuals are clean, bright, and rather detailed, as would be expected from a reputable show. While there is nothing special here, there is nothing particularly wrong either (though don't expect any impressive fight scenes).\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors were pretty pivotal for me: while the Japanese actors are passionate and bring life to the characters, the English actors sound misplaced. In the English version, Saya becomes a much younger-sounding girl, Hagi a far more British-sounding man, and Van is suddenly cast as a German. All of this detracts from a storyline that carries itself without the need for such vocal creativity. The show's soundtrack is well done and the Bach pieces performed by Hagi add to the elements of suspense and despair. The most memorable song and theme throughout the series, Diva's Song, is a truly beautiful opera piece which brings to life the evil genius of the enemy. Ultimately, Blood+ offers an exciting and suspenseful storyline with acceptable animation and a nice soundtrack - highly recommended.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7.7/10\\n\r\nAudio: 8.2/10\\n\r\nStory/Script: 8.7/10\\n\r\nOverall Score: 8.5/10 (Excellent)\\n\\n\r\nFor a full synopsis with review and downloadable episodes/OST check out my blog at http://animefiend.blogspot.com",

The details in the animation decreased by about 70% and that`s odd because shouldn`t it be getting better after each season? For example in season 3 in the anime look at the television and how the reporters are drawn. I usually cackle at bad drawings but I really liked the idea of this anime and I was upset that the directors/executives didn`t take more time with it. I`m a stickler for good drawing so I rated it harshly. However I did finished it becauseI remember watching it years ago and never did. Lastly some of the characters` actions were so illogical I felt as though they were just killing off everybody for no reason.",

I like that it goes back in time and explains the history and backstories. The art and sound were fine. \r\nThe main problem is the main character, Saya. Basically the entire series is her saying \"I can't\" and whining and being a big annoying baby. I can understand the first few episode/fights, yeah the chiropterans are big and scary. But this literallygoes on until the very end, it's really really annoying. \\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are okay, but nowhere near cool enough to make up for Saya's horribleness.",

It has the perfect amounts of violence, plot development, character development, and don't forget romance!  \r\nNow for the let downs:\r\nThe first episode with the flashback is a bit misleading because the series in ALL blood and gore.  The plot ca move a bit slowly at times and it is heavily dependant on a main character that seems to just be completely useless at first, but it gets better towards the end.  They also could have given a specific timeline a bit more because all of the characters have a lot of history.  Some of thefights are kind of a let down and bit short in some cases.  \\n\\n\r\nNow for the awesomeness:\\n\r\nThe animation is really all that detailed but it is quite good.  And of course, all the characters are very well-developed and you can see the changes in their personality as the series progresses.  The male characters (most of them anyway) are actually fairly attractive, which is always a plus for girls.  Even though the series doesn't revolve around romace there is enough of it to make you happy.  lol  And of course, it isn't obscemely long or boring and it has enough comic relief to not make you depressed.  \\n",

Once I watch something it's over! Never to be seen again! But this anime, I just can't leave behind!\r\nWhat I LOVED: Pretty much everything except a few select things. One, though I knew this was intentional, it left me feeling sad and depressed on many occasions. Also, I don't like blood usually. Considering the title was Blood Plus, I knew what I was getting into. BUT WHO CARES NOW!!! THIS ANIMEIS FREAKING AWESOME!!! \\n\r\nThe romance is NOT forgettable. Man, can I even say who it was between? You know what? I will! Saya and Hagi were beautiful together. The ending was so fulfilling that I sat there and smiled for about ten minutes. Hagi is one of my favorite men in anime, and the thing that completes his awesomeness is Crispin Freeman voicing him. See, even his VOICE ACTOR is hot! That's how smokin' he is!\\n\r\nOn a serious note, this show will leave you really thinking. While it has its funny and romantic moments, it's mostly serious and depressing. On some points distubring, even. While some characters could've been written out better, I believe that doesn't matter in the long run. \\n\r\nNow that I have that off my chest, I can score it now! Overall, I give this anime a 10/10. If you love fantasy and fighting and supense, this show is a nice pick for you. It's fifty episodes long, but trust me, they FLY BY!!!! ;)",

The plot is brilliant and kept me on edge the of my seat whole time and made me want more. The main characters suffer more than enough of tragedy in their life and makes the best of what they got. In blood+ you see a lot of flashbacks to make you try to piece together the story in front of you. One of the main male leads is haji,has one of the best features you can find in a character, hes dedicated to be by the lead character saya's side. For me the characters really made the show.Blood+ is perfect in every way with a twisted ending and a flawless plot. I'm pretty picky and it takes a lot to get me to give a show a 10 but as soon as you see it you will say the same!",

Who helped rebuild their economy and established their democratic and capitalist structure? The animation is fine, but the Saya and Kai are really dumb. I hate seeing dumb and emotional characters as well as Kai's dumb script, dialogue, or what he says. There are little tidbits on how the show just doesn't make sense naturally and that they're no limits in their world so anything can happen. The enviromental details are alsovery bad such as Viet Nam. A lot of issues I have with the show is things like using platinum credit cards to buy whatever they want in Viet Nam when the people there don't even accept such cards at vendors. Vietnam also looks very developed when in reality, it's very run down. It's one of the poorest countries in the world yet they can afford a big private girls school. Not only that, but the drawings of the faces of asians are so bad that you can't even tell the difference between a Jap and a Vietnamese. They don't know the landscape of Vietnam at all and that orphanage they had of children who come there because their parents were killed by duds..... Well first of all, orphanages don't even take care of the orphans in Vietnam and duds don't exist in suburban areas especially their capital except for the ones that remains as tourist sites of the traps they made. I'm only on episode 6 and they messed up that much about Vietnam in like 2 episodes. If they messed up that badly, then what other features of different cultures did they mess up. You even wonder if they've even visited these areas before they even did their show. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEdit: Episode 9 now. \\n\r\nOh my FUCKING GOOOODDDD. They don't give scholarships in Vietnam, especially to fucking musicians. You don't get money there as a musician, even a professional one. AND NO ONE IS STUPID ENOUGH TO FIND DUDS AND SELL THEM AS SCRAP METAL EVEN IF THEY DID EXIST IN VILLAGES IN VIETNAM. My god these people are retarded. I don't know who made this show, but they need to do some serious homework. And who the hell would even buy their scrap metal......",

            "content": "Blood+ follows Saya Otonashi, an average Japanese schoolgirl who finds out she's a millenia-old Vampire and must do battle with her sister, Diva. Unfortunately, what should have been a simple \"find x, fight, tropes, repeat\" is a weird mix of drawn-out subplots and some slippery sliding. What should have been a decent shounen/shoujo series accomplishes that, but finds it difficult to do much else. \r\nThe director for the series is Junichi Fujisaku, whom wrote a for xxxHolic, Tsubasa, and even tried his hand at a Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex episode. That last one is especially notable being that 1) it was thesecond episode of the series, and 2) it wasn't all that good as a GitS episode. What could have been in that respect is thankfully never brought over to this series. Unfortunately, my limited experience with Junichi's work hampers my ability to properly evaluate the series and his influence, so don't expect it to be talked about beyond this. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not opposed to strong, female leads in any medium. The entire cast are well-written and behave as you would expect, which is to say that they're about as \"real\" as anyone can get in this series. Saya starts off naive and unsure about things, but transitions into a brave, lone-wolf type before the end. When she finally re-joins the good guys, it becomes clear that her motivation is purely selfish, even if it's for a good reason. Her support, unfortunately, is such a creepy, unhelpful twat that you end up wondering why he exists.\\n\\n\r\nKai (Saya's not-blood-related brother, because incest isn't incest when we're not related, right?) serves as one-half \"brave onii-chan\" and one-half brother-with-fixation-on-sister. While I want to ride the \"creepy brother is creepy\" train, his character isn't just driven by the mad boner he has for Saya. He starts off as a truly loving, caring brother who wants to look after his family and, failing that, vows to at least save the remaining family he possesses. The character is a well-blended mix of powerful motivation and what happens when a regular person is pushed into a situation he wasn't built for. \\n\\n\r\nI could go on about the characters, but you want to know the goodies. The sound is good and all of Diva's singing scenes are well-done, if only because they need to be. The OST are a decent blend and fit the scenes, though I can recall maybe once or twice their use being a bit much. In terms of animation, Chizu Hashii helms the series. I couldn't find much on the individual, but from what the series offered, I'm somewhere between unsure and moderately interested in their other works. \\n\\n\r\nWhat the series suffers from isn't anything obvious at first. The story is decent if generic and while the characters and their motivations make sense, there are times when a simple sit-down and hash things out approach would make more sense. Saya's motivations are purely selfish and while they are good, it comes off as her not really listening to what everyone else is saying. Kai is also a bit pushy and rather possessive and while Haji works as a butler, his fixation and lack of DOING ANYTHING makes him feel like a convenient tool to push Saya into the next subplot. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few subplots at work, too. The overarching plot is often shoved aside and it feels like the director wasn't sure he wanted to carry on with the main plot at times. I enjoyed the subplots more than the overarching one and want to see these characters in their own series. Unfortunately, the series also suffers from \"kill everyone who isn't a main character\" syndrome and does so without so much as properly building them up.\\n\\n\r\nIt's an overall decent series, but suffers from its shortcomings in the long-run. Check it out if you're even halfway tempted, but otherwise miss it.",

The music itself fits the scenes very well and adds up to the actions and emotions in this anime series.\r\nIf you love romance and a slow but action-packed series, Blood+ is your answer.

It is anything but your run of the mill vampire story.  It is a historical story gift wrapped in blood and the paranormal; weaved together in ways that only the highest art can accomplish. \r\nBlood+ opens with scenes from the killing fields of Vietnam. Brutal and nightmarish, the tragic scene unfolds.  When one sees such carnage one can only ask himself what seperates \"man\" from \"beast\".\r\nBlood + wants the viewer to become trapped within Saya's world, toanswer the question for ourselves; to face the horror within. The classic art style is used to reflect Saya and her world, and does so marvelously. \\n\r\nThe music and sound is outstanding, the opening scene alone is proof of this; as the sound draws the viewer in to trap them in the world.  In short Blood + is the \"Apocalypse Now\" of anime. \\n\\n\r\nWith that said, this anime is not for everyone.  Some scenes may be too intense. This is in the horror category afterall.  Some may also say that the pacing is too slow. However, I feel that pacing is very good, and if you can stomach it, you won't be disappointed.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "Yes I gave this almost all 10s. Why? \r\nFirst off, I almost didn't watch this because of the title--Blood+? Sounded like one of those vampire anime (yes, I'm super bias and usually hate that stuff). But--I gave it a shot after seeing that Crispin Freeman is the voice for a very dark, mysterious looking character. Knowing he always does an incredible job, I tried it.\r\nWell, I finished the 50 ep series in a weekish. I'm a working adult...I made time for this...I like giving succinct, spoiler-free reviews. Read on.\r\nThis is not about vampires--not really. The plot is intelligently written with incredible twists and real characterdevelopment. It's not just about killing monsters and saving the world. I never thought I'd see a show again where I actually cared about the main characters and wanted to cry with them. Saya and Haji's relationship is amazing. Nothing in this story is simple, just like real life. I could not stop thinking about when I would have time to watch the next episode. It's plan addictive, because you fall in love with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is amazing, and some of the music pieces (when Haji plays cello) are outstanding. Hans Zimmer produced the music for this, so what do you expect? Check him out. He's done a lot of epic soundtracks for Hollywood.\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason why I knocked the story down to a 9 is because there are a few characters that have minor roles in the story that you may or may not care about. But to say it weakens the plot is honestly ridiculous. Every single character in this show was crafted to play a special role. \\n\\n\r\nLike Noein or Eureka, I don't know why this show isn't in the top 10 on animelist. It is incredible. Give it a shot, stick with it after the first four or five episodes. The beginning is mostly development of the plot--and then it TAKES OFF. There are no filler episodes. Have fun and get ready to fall in love with certain characters and be taken on a crazy adventure. It's amazing, heartbreaking, and filled with hope and wonder.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my first anime review ever (I'm not a very dedicated watcher or anything) but I felt like reviewing the series is a nice way to reflect on it.\r\nI just finished watching all 50 episodes and to summarize, I think it's pretty mediocre overall. The thing is that the drama gets forced on you all the time. The writers don't seem to pick their moments and push in entire character speeches, even in mid-action, about the characters motivation for fighting yada yada yada. Buzzlines like \"you're still our family\" and \"I will protect you\" get thrown around a lot. It isn't bad in itselfbut they should pick their moments better.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty neat, telling the struggle of two immortal sisters, one raised in a caring environment, the other only knowing hatred and bloodshed. Sometimes the characters are a bit flat (mainly due to those continuous speeches) but at least some episodes are dedicated to put some more life into them.\\n\\n\r\nThe action and animation are of a good level. The action is a bit repetitive, and the characters don't seem to get that shooting immortal creatures isn't going to help (even when doing it for the 20th time). The sound is decent although there's a lot of material being reused all the time.\\n\\n\r\nSo that wraps it up I think. Thanks for reading.",
