            "content": "*Spoiler warning* Do not read story section unless you've finished the series.\r\n\"Hakuouki\" is based on a PS2 romance adventure otome game (games targeted toward girls).\r\nThe story starts with Yukimura Chizuru, daughter of a doctor in Edo (Tokyo's old name), arriving Kyoto in search of her father. She is saved by two Shinsengumi members from zombie-like demon, and gets taken into custody. Eventually she gains their trust and helps them out while looking for clues of her father.\r\nShinsengumi is an organization that actually existed in the late-Edo-period that acted as a 'special police' that served to suppress any anti-government movement in Kyoto. The actual organization onlyexisted for less than a decade, but their legacies have been depicted in various novels, movies, and TV doramas that they have become something of a symbol of justice in the Edo-era. The latest Shinsengumi hit has been the NHK Taiga dorama \"Shinsengumi!\" starring SMAP's Katori Shingo in 2004. NHK, the government-owned TV station's Taiga dorama series are known for practically guaranteed 15%+ viewership ratings and A-list actors.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime's events and characters are inspired by the actual Shinsengumi, but the story is completely fictional.\\n\r\nThe title \"Hakuouki\" is a made-up word comprised of kanji \"Light-colored Sakura\" and \"Ogre\". It describes the fictional vampire-like white-haired (light color) undead (Sakura) demons (ogres) in this series. Sakura (Cherry blossoms) symbolizes death or short-lived beauty for the short span in which the pink flowers blossom in spring. (Sakura also symbolizes farewells and new meetings since they bloom during graduation and new school year, which is April in Japan, but that is probably not the case in this series)\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION:\\n\r\nAnimation in general lacked detail, and characters' faces were really deformed in some scenes while they were extremely well-drawn in close up and action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing they really succeeded in this show was use of lighting to create mood. From hazy moonlight to orange glow in the daytime to bloody red sunset, the light always seemed to shine from one direction, and matched the atmosphere they were trying to create.\\n\\n\r\nOne fatal flaw in the animation... was character design in the sense that they were all too idolized. Sure, all the main characters wore Shinsengumi uniforms with swords around their waist, but all I saw was a bunch of host and a school girl in cosplay. It all comes down to fan service, and they all seemed out of place amid peasants and lowly Shinsengumi members who looked legitimately from the Edo-era.\\n\r\nThey even went as far as trying to have Chizuru pass for a boy. I know back in the day, it was unthinkable for a girl to be dressed like a boy, but please, you must be joking.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nMain characters looked like hosts, at least they sounded like hosts too. Despite the fact that they were totally out of place, they stayed consistent by speaking modern Japanese the whole way and and all the characters sounded like they should.\\n\\n\r\nMusic in slice-of-life scenes had a serene, calming flow that worked very nicely in the background, which intensified in plot twists or confrontations, enhancing drama in every occasion. Powerful drum beats are added in action scenes, which not only fit the era well, but also made them all that more exciting.\\n\\n\r\nTheme songs were ridiculously good for this series. OP song was epic with extremely catchy tune, elegant lyric, and great vocal. Amazing piece of contemporary Jpop-Enka hybrid that really blew me away. ED was pretty good, the somber song worked nicely for this series since many episodes ended with a tragedy. Sound and Marketing department sure have a lot of work ahead of them if they're to match or surpass the theme song quality and compatibility in season 2.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY/CHARACTER:\\n\r\nBefore we even get to the story... there was a major problem with power balance in this anime. I can accept Oni villains being insanely strong because they're not human, but how are some of the Shinsengumi members able to fight almost evenly against them? What's even more puzzling is that those fighters struggle against lowly samurai when outnumbered. From their performance against the Oni, they should be able to easily defeat 10 minions by themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThis leads to the main problem with the story: Irrational character motives and too much sudden story developments between events.\\n\\n\r\n- Oni can so easily penetrate Shinsengumi's defense, as proven by Kazama and Nagumo. Why didn't they just come in and kidnap Chizuru anytime they wanted? There was nothing there to stop them from second or third tries after the first attempt failed. (Why did it even take that long to make the first attempt?)\\n\\n\r\n- I didn't exactly see how Chizuru fell in love with Hijikata. Seemed just like Hijikata was being excessively strict few times, and got persuaded by other members to bend the rules. It was a WTF moment for me when Chizuru started blushing when her twin sister asked her if she's staying for love.\\n\\n\r\n- Overly gullible characters. Gets tricked so easily by villains and has no self-discipline when given the choice with the elixir. These guys are definitely not leader materials, and it's a wonder Shinsengumi can last so long with such incompetent commanders.\\n\\n\r\n- You're trying to kill Chizuru for seeing a classified subject, and the next second, you're trusting her to send messages in a life-or-death situation.\\n\\n\r\n- Chizuru, do not walk toward vampires when you're bleeding! Use common sense.\\n\r\n- Chizuru, run when you see danger! You're helpless, and you staying around is not going to help the injured or dead.\\n\r\n- Chizuru, PLEASE TRY TO ACTIVATE SELF-DEFENSE INSTINCT OF YOUR BRAIN! Help will not always arrive out of blue.\\n\\n\r\n- Hijikata drinking elixir in the last episode came out nowhere. Where did he even get it? And his motive makes no sense, I mean... you're not human anymore, just because someone (who you knew didn't kill your best friend) provoked you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMaking a non-cheesy fictional story based on historical events is difficult. Add vampires, Oni, rushed storyline, and this feat becomes practically impossible.\\n\\n\r\nThe least they could've done was provide more backgrounds to each incident rather than \"XXX advanced their troops to Kyoto\", battle scene, \"And this will eventually come to be known as Battle of YYY\" before jumping to another historical event.\\n\\n\r\nI think they should've just used the Edo-era setting with original events rather than try to camouflage an actual event.\\n\\n\r\nThe DBZ-style talking during battles, or talking for so long that backup arrive certainly didn't make the story any more believable.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL:\\n\r\nAnother unrealistic jidaigeki, I would have to say this is girl's version of \"Sengoku Basara\". Instead of mindless battles, you have mindless melodrama, which starts to get pretty predictable even without knowledge of Japanese history. In the end, it was a bidanshi cosplay fest, as expected of a shoujo anime. The story jumps from one historical battle to another, it's easy to tell this is just another \"Rurouni Kenshin\"-inspired piece that hopped on bandwagon of the latest Shinsengumi craze initiated by the 2004 NHK Taiga dorama.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I have to say that the characters are charming as intended, and the Oni villains are cool enough to have me watch this season to the end, and if I have a lot of time to kill, I'll be able to tolerate another season just to see how bad it gets.",

            "content": "Ignoring the fact it's been a game, and the main female character is the most frustrating, ignorant and helpless ever, this is a brilliant anime. \r\nEven if you find the story a little...sparse at times, the reason you should /definitely/ watch to the end of every single episode is the male characters - both the drawing of them and the personalities themselves. They aren't, like a lot of mangas based on games, guys who may be hot but are stupid, masochistic and aloof. They are warm, funny, incredibly good looking (a major bonus) and, of course, incredibly protective of the female protagonist.\r\nChizuru (the female protagonist)is the only reason (alongside the plot sometimes having holes big enough to drive a truck through) you might find this a little tiresome. She is, considering her 'powers' (something you'll find out about) incredibly helpless and unable to fend for herself - something I find most INFURIATING in girl characters.\\n\r\nI sticked through it because I thought there would be some sort of 'Kick-ass' moment where she'd begin to shine, but so far nil-but maybe there is hope for the second series?\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the guys do make up for it tenfold. A few I feel I should mention is Saitou, Okita and Heisuke.\\n\r\nSaitou is just...brilliant. He's more than adequate for man candy but also a brilliant swordsman and very smart. One of your serious glasses types (but obviously without the glasses)\\n\r\nOkita is a lovely character, he gets fleshed out a lot more than the others seem to (for instance, from what I can gather so far it seems as if she's getting together with Hijikata, but nothing has been developed in his character for you to warm to him at all.). I really enjoyed the episodes with him involved, and he's a sight for sore eyes!\\n\r\nHeisuke is my personal favourite. He's the youngest, same age as Chizuru, but utterly brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, you should watch for the fight scenes (guys), and the man candy (girls) and just the characters! I highly recommend it.",

            "content": "Japan's history is written mostly in blood rather than ink, which represents the source of interest for many people, with me proudly among them.\r\nThe story evolves around the Shinsengumi, the late Tokugawa Shogunate secret police.\r\nThey are followed in their struggle against the changing times where the old samurai ways of fighting and living are replaced by the incursion of western culture.\r\nIn Hakuouki the concept of time is well determinate, meaning that events don't unfold day after day and neither do battles so from that point of view its a plus.\r\nBeing a historical inspired tale ensures a certain continuity of the episodes while presenting key elementsof that historical period.\\n\r\nI was literally enthralled by the fighting scenes because they aren't just flashed at great speed and because they add up to the fluidity of the series.\\n\r\nAlso they are not displayed in the form of a white cut on a black background all while being dynamic and thrilling.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork is a great combination of lighting and details that not only provides a great enviroment but also presents some of they best made individual characters I have seen in all my time since I started enjoying anime industry.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters have their own ideals struggles or rivalries but at times they merge into a single personality, for example when they all gather under one roof. They act according to their traits and each of them is faced with interior problems.\\n\r\nSince the army factor is very relevant to the series, the series display certain scenes that follow the morale of the support cast.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end if you enjoy a good action drama and historical tale then Hakuouki is definitely a good choice for you. It is very enjoyable while providing a good image of the events that unfolded during the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hakuouki is an anime made by Studio DEEN, who have, in recent years, gained infamy for putting their names to a variety of very poor shows in recent years, as well as making a horribly butchered adaptation of Umineko. So, does Hakuouki enter the ranks of awful DEEN series, or does it redeem the studio? Well, put simply, it is terrible. It is a perfect example of why DEEN are a bad studio. There isn't a single good thing about it.\r\nBut before I get into the details about why Hakuouki is horrible, let's just sum up what Hakuouki is about for those not familiar withthe series. The series is introduced with a young \"boy\" trying to escape from a strange vampire-like demon. At the last minute, \"he\" is saved by a group of samurai, who then take \"him\" hostage. As it turns out, the \"boy\" has seen more than he should have done, and is now being held captive by a large group of suspiciously attractive men. As it also turns out, the boy is named Chizuru and is not a boy, and is a girl disguising as one. If this sounds clich\u00e9 to you then that's probably because it is.\\n\\n\r\nAs it turns out, Chizuru is looking for her father, a doctor who went missing in Kyoto. Later on, it turns out that her father is involved with the medicine that turns men into the aforementioned vampires that are never once called vampires in spite of being nocturnal creatures once human but now superhuman who lust after human blood.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the biggest problem with Hakuouki is, rather simply, that it is boring. Throughout the entire 12 episodes, the show held my interest for maybe 5 seconds at most. Despite being a show about swordsmen and demons, there is very little action. While a similar statement can be made of Saraiya Goyou, a similarly themed show that aired at the same time, the fact is that while the latter keeps the viewer's interest with a quirky style, fascinating dialogue, and originality, Hakuouki does nothing of the sort. Hakuouki is rather bland, having no real selling point other than the cast of bishonens. Stylistically, the themes that run through Hakuouki have been done before many times, and better. And the worst complaint that can be said of it is the dialogue. Hakuouki is an adaptation of a visual novel, but it doesn't seem to understand the \"adaptation\" part of that. Everything in this show is just talking. The action is almost never focused on, and is completely weightless when it is. The plot has no intrigue or suspense. It is just talking. This could have been forgiveable, but even worse is that the dialogue isn't even good. It's just boring and lifeless, and it begs the question of why this was taken from a VN at all when it simply acts exactly like one.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I said before that the selling point of the show is the bishonens, but there's a problem with that too. As a heterosexual male, I know that I am not the target audience, but there are still some clear problems even taking that into account. For a start, there isn't a single character in this show with a likeable or memorable character trait. Every single one of them is completely one-dimensional. None of them are developed on, very few of them go through any kind of personal struggle, and at the end of it almost every character is simply forgettable. To make things worse, the character design in Hakuouki is extremely weak. It is often completely impossible to tell one character apart from another, with them all being uniformed, alongside many of them sharing various features with other characters, and combined with my previous complaint it can often make the show confusing out of a lack of basic knowledge for which character is which.\\n\\n\r\nThe only character who is actually worth mentioning here is Chizuru, the shoddily disguised centre of our reverse-harem. But don't mistake my meaning, she is by no means a good character. For the most part, she is only memorable simply for being the only girl. But due to her being in focus, unlike 90% of the cast, she becomes memorable, and her faults become noticeable. For one, she does not help the plot at all for most of the series, except towards the end, in which her only role is to become a living MacGuffin that the enemy forces want. When thrown into combat, she is completely useless, and seems to have no self-defence instinct whatsoever, leading other characters to become injured in her stead while she just stands there.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is one of the few moments where the show is actually interesting, but it may also be the worst for the complete contradictions we are shown. Now, I don't want to spoil anybody, but it's going to be hard to discuss the ending without doing so, so if you are particularly spoiler-sensitive and want to watch this series for whatever reason, I would advise you to skip the rest of this paragraph. Basically, one of the samurai is killed in front of Chizuru, and a member of the enemy force is nearby at the time, though he was not the one responsible. Another member of the samurai sees this, blames the demon, and drinks the potion that turns people into the not-vampire creatures so he will have the strength to kill him. Now, there are several problems with this. For a start, a very curious question is raised... where did he get the potion? The potion is not supposed to be easily accessible, for obvious reasons. He had no reason to plan for an event like this, so he would not have prepared it. There is no foreshadowing or reason that suggests he was already considering the change. It simply doesn't make sense. But on top of that, after the battle, he reveals that he knew that the man wasn't responsible for his death. Which now means that the drinker just sentenced himself to a life as an undead monster to get revenge on a man he knew wasn't even responsible.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, Hakuouki repeatedly proves itself to be a terrible show without a single redeeming feature, but just to put the cherry on top, DEEN are giving it a sequel in the fall. Yes, you heard that right... somehow, this mess of an anime has gathered enough of a fanbase to warrant a sequel. So sadly, we haven't even seen the end of this series.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure I've made this clear by now, but my verdict on this anime is simply a no. It does not deserve to be watched by anybody, and if there is any justice in the world it will have been completely forgotten by the end of the year... at least if DEEN don't end up making a third series.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: I'd have more fun watching paint dry.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Graphics: 3/10\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 1/10\\n\r\nMusic/Background: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10",

This is from the perspective of someone who only watched the anime.\r\nStory: 10\r\nI really enjoyed the story. The historic content was interesting. The added elements of Rasetsu and the conflicts with the Oni were also captivating. There was nothing with the story that bothered me, and I didn't feel bored, not even once. I usually don't watch Shoujo anime because I hate sappy romance and girly stuff, but this anime was an exception. There were no scenes with girls crying that they love this and that. Chizuruwas more like a member of the Shinsengumi. There was even action and sword-fighting, and that was entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nIt was amazing. The characters looked perfect. The scenery was great. The fight scenes were animated well also. Nothing to complain about here. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nEnding and opening sequences had nice songs that fit the anime. Sounds during the anime blended in well also.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nI really like each Shinsengumi member. They all had different, but intriguing personalities. I would like to be around them, they were cool. The only character that bothered me was Chizuru. She tried to help out the Shinsengumi, but I still think she was a scaredy-cat. She couldn't protect herself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nWhat else can I say? It was one of my favorite animes. I even want to play the video game and read the manga now.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nThis anime is worth it to watch!",

            "content": "Hello all!  I'm not very good at writing but I just thought I share my thoughts on this one because i really enjoyed the first episode!\r\nOkay this anime got me hooked. The story line is pretty much what the synopsis is! I think this anime has great potential because the art, music, personality of each character is so interesting. I thought that the artwork was somewhat dark and yet tranquil. If you like SWORDS+SAMURAI ISH+VAMPIRES/OGRE this is the anime for you. Also! I'm so into the traditional Japanese historical setting. I think it connects the past for us viewers to relate to culture. Andi did do some research on the characters it turns out some of the characters are actual people that were military leaders so I thought that was SOOO COOL!  \\n\\n\r\nThe opening has some hints on why I think the anime is going to do well. It hinted that there are going to be a lot of battles and each character will unfold their own tale. So I hope this helps you anime lovers. I really do love it and it's nice to finally see some hot boys fight with swords and transform into vampires if they drink this \"medicine.\" :D\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of Romance, i don't want to say it is a typical romance story but in a way it is. The main female character is taken away and being protected by men. She is in a way imprisoned and kidnapped or forced against her will. Now i'm assuming love with unfold with one of the men so which is why this is a very successful romance story. If anyone reads old romance novels in general and if you don't then  what makes a romance novel successful is a female usually gets kidnaped/forced to stay somewhere. At first the female will resent the men but slowly their kindness reveals and they end up falling in love. So mY PREDICTION is that this will also happen. Obviously though. haha but what i'm saying is this is \"considered\" a successful romance story based on what I've seen so far!!\\n\\n\r\n-I apologize if this didn't help! This is like my second time writing a review~~ ^^* enjoy though!",

            "content": "After having watched 5 episodes of Hakuouki I feel at liberty to write that this is an excellent anime, worth every minute you take to watch it. \r\nThe story is good so far. Although not yet fully disclosed, it looks better as you watch each episode. I absolutely love the historical genre, and all the political turmoil taking place in the 19th century. I may be partial to the genre, but it evokes a constant feel of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, so I cannot go higher.\r\nThe main (male) characters (members of Kondo faction of Shinsengumi) are all named after real members of the faction. Other than that,they are quite typical, and there's really nothing out of the ordinary in this department. Despite the fact that this anime takes the road already travelled in the portrayal of characters, it does it good. The characters are neither boring nor two-dimensional, and they have their respective personalities. It would be a sin not to mention the fact that there's a bunch of angry, virtuous sword-wielders who are beautiful, and that the main female character is not too annoying or too incapable of action.\\n\r\nI guess I should elaborate on my overall grade. Truth being told, if I wasn\u2019t writing this review I would have given it an 8 or a 9. Because, when I don\u2019t review a series I\u2019m mostly governed by the level of enjoyment in grading it. After careful consideration, it is impossible to give it more than 7, because Hakuouki is obviously a series made for the sake of pure enjoyment.\\n",

            "content": "its still too early to say how the anime will turn out to be, I mean we are just through with episode 1. I am already seeing mixed to awesome reviews for this anime series. And why not? Its a famous \"Neo-Romance\" game, which has been turned into an anime now, with Bishies as the center point. Although I do have mixed feelings for this one as we already know how the previous Neo-Romance animes have ended, for example La Corda D'oro. The female protagonist never ends up with any guy, a real DISAPPOINTMENT for romance enthusiasts like me :(. I am hoping this isn'tgonna happen here because even if the anime is having Romance as the central point, the historical & Political plot makes it more interesting (at least compared to a musical romance like Corda).\\n\\n\r\nStory -9\\n\r\nThe main plot is about the main protagonist searching for her missing father and gets the help of the Shinsengumi. While helping her almost all the guys fall for her. Sounds very much like Corda, but here comes the difference, there are some mysterious secrets that the Shinsengumi are hiding for Chizuru, our main female lead. What is the Shinsengumi being so secretive about? Why keep a female disguised as a male in their group? And why are the Shinsengumi so keen on discovering Chizuru's missing father? What do they really want from Chizuru? These are some questions like these that left me hanging and craving for more :).\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nIn one word the art is beautiful (Kire desu). Its awesomely gorgeous with the way the creators have captured the background of historical time Japan. I'm sure we can look forward some more marvelous action sequence and pictorial beauty in the coming up episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nSound seems very apt with the anime, especially the fight sequences. Although its still the start but the OP and ED are really cool songs and maybe you can check the soundtracks of this PS2 game online. I have heard some of the OST's and they are really good. Five stars ***** for music\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -9\\n\r\nWell I could have given it a 10 because of the bishies, but let's be real, bishies always look so dishy, especially in dating Sim changed into an anime series. So I tried to hold my bias here, but yes the characters look more real then in a 2-D game for sure :D.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nOK, Bishies, history,politics with romance being the center plot and some comedy, drama and action thrown in between, you've got an almost perfect \"Gourmet Delight\" of entertainment served.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8\\n\r\nYeah, the rating may change because we are just minus one episode so you never know ;)!!! I am looking forward to it, cant wait for the next one. MUST WATCH, that's all I can say for now.\\n",

            "content": "Story. 7\r\nIt's a good setup, if you like reverse-harem.  A young girl in search of her father is taken in by a group of warriors that is also searching for him.  However, the plot didn't really advance all that fast.  Certainly the political situation was constantly evolving, but in terms of what was going on the heroine, she was basically a bystander who did almost nothing.\r\nArt. 9\r\nBeautiful art, especially character design.  And the fight scenes were surprisingly decent, for a reverse-harem.  Fangirls who like guys with silver hair will be especially pleased.\r\nSound. 6\r\nThe soundtrack worked fine with the show, butthere were no melodies that stood out to me.  Not something I'd choose to listen to on its own.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter. 8\\n\r\nI think character would get a 7 if not for Okita.  The heroine was extremely boring and typical, the usual weak anime girl who is protected at every moment and does absolutely nothing for herself.  I was fairly disappointed.  I had real expectations for her development, but she was a lot like Yuki from Vampire Knight.  Even after you find out she's a bit special, she doesn't do a single interesting thing.  What's more, she often puts people in danger inadvertently because she can't stay put.  Considering that her father was a doctor, at the very least she could have had some real medical knowledge, but all you see her doing is occasionally wrapping bandages.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. 6\\n\r\nIn retrospect, I'm surprised I got through it.  Until the very end, I was expecting the heroine to do something.  I've seen enough anime at this point that I should've known better.  Still, I'm a big fan of the reverse harem genre, and I had a weak spot for both Okita and Kazama.\\n\\n\r\nOverall. 7\\n\r\nI've suffered way more through other shows.  That's why it gets a 7 even though I didn't get much out of it.  I do not recommend this to guys.  I do not recommend this to girls who like strong heroines.  If you need comedy in your anime, or strong plot, it's also not for you.  And there weren't enough fights to satisfy someone who likes a lot of swordplay in their shows.  This is really just for reverse-harem/bishounen/vampire fans and maybe those who are especially into artistically beautiful anime regardless of content.",

            "content": "I really wanted to like Hakuouki since it presents a lot of interesting ideas.  Ultimately however, Hakuouki never decides on a main plot.  Instead it flirts with subplot after subplot, ultimately failing to adequately develop or resolve any of them.  \r\nStory - 3/10 (Poor)\r\nThe story is difficult to describe, because of the apparent lack of one.  The anime begins with Chizuru, our appointed \"protagonist\", leaving her home and venturing to a city foreign to her in order to find her father.  With this kind of opening, you'd expect that this quest would make up a significant portion of the anime.After all, it is Chizuru's main motivation.  Instead, Chizuru meets the Shinsengumi and she becomes merely the observer of their deeds, without having any real impact on their actions.  \\n\\n\r\nOf course, she's supposed to be relevant and there is a story line to suggest she's the most important person in the series, complete with high-powered \"evil\" after her.  However, like the rest of the subplots, it is never really developed, fully explained, or concluded.  \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that Chizuru is merely an observer for most of the anime could be acceptable.  The Shinsengumi are embroiled in enough martial actions and political intrigue, not to mention a fair number of secrets, to carry the show.  However, like Chizuru's story line, their actions are disjointed, never flushed out, and lack an overarching narrative.  To the show's detriment, it's never really made clear what they're fighting for.  Flushing out the ever present camaraderie of the Shinsengumi's members, perhaps giving a bit of background to their relationships with each other, would make their sacrifices and the ending meaningful.  As it is, the conclusion doesn't conclude anything and all the noble actions of the Shinsengumi are left feeling hollow.  \\n\\n\r\nArt - 6 (Fair)\\n\r\nThe characters look nice, vibrant, and fairly distinct from one another.  Everything else is entirely forgettable.  \\n\\n\r\nSound - 6 (Fair)\\n\r\nNothing's wrong with the sound, but nothing stands out either.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6 (Fair)\\n\r\nThe characters are easily the best thing about this anime.  While Chizuru herself is the typical damsel in distress heroine, she isn't as annoying as some.  Of course, that is mainly due to the fact that she is overshadowed by the Shinsengumi.  The members of the Shinsengumi, while falling into the typical stereotypes, are given a sense of depth through their relationships with each other and their own individual conflicts.  \\n\\n\r\nI would rate the characters higher, but again the lack of a cohesive plot gets in the way.  Many of these characters have subplots of their own that begin to flesh them out and make them genuinely likable.  However, all of their stories are only partially developed then ignored completely.  Which begs the question, why bother?  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5 (Mediocre)\\n\r\nThe lack of a solid driving force behind the events that occur in Hakuouki is a serious detraction and gets in the way of enjoying what the series does well.  Even though the camaraderie between the Shinsengumi is interesting to watch, the fact that the conflicts faced by each member are summarily dismissed without resolution makes any attachment to the characters seem irrelevant.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5 (Mediocre)\\n\r\nHakuouki tries to do too much and in the end fails to deliver anything noteworthy.  Perhaps if you've played/read the source material, you may find more enjoyment out of it.  I am only considering the anime as it stands.  There seems to be a sequel that may rectify the lack of any resolution to the plot, but considering how bafflingly mishandled the story development was in the 12 episodes this series was allotted, I don't have my hopes up.  Overall, if you're interested in this anime, I suggest to wait for the sequel and see if its plot/subplots are sorted out in that one, otherwise you're bound to be disappointed.",

            "content": "I've seen a lot of negative reviews on this anime citing that it's boring, there is too much history, not enough action and so on. Frankly, you're in the wrong section. If you read a description and don't recognize the time periods or groups the anime is using, don't downrate it because you are ignorant of history. \r\nNow, that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. It's set in a very similar time period to Rurouni Kenshin except Hakuouki is set before and during the revolution. It revolves around a girl named Chizuru who left Edo to search for her father in Kyoto. While there,she runs into the Shinsengumi (who you may also remember from Kenshin) and they decide to keep her around because her father is the doctor they are looking for. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of criticism for Chizuru's character. That she is a \"Mary-Sue\" and is weak. This anime is set in 1863 in a realistic Japanese backdrop. I don't think the women's rights movement had quite made it over there yet, folks. Chizuru is already walking the line by dressing like a man and carrying a sword for 99% of the show. Expecting her to suddenly turn into the ultra warrior during the age of samurai vs. bullets is, frankly, unrealistic. Keeping this in mind, I did find her character likeable. She really does do everything in her power to protect those around her and help as much as she can, despite being female. I can think of maybe 2 instances where she was \"annoying\" and both are easily made up for and forgotten. Chizuru also hides a powerful secret in her heritage that makes her wanted by several different groups hunting her. \\n\\n\r\nThe bulk of the rest of the cast is made up of bishonen and random soldiers. This anime is often classified as a \"reverse harem\" but I really don't see that. These guys do not fight over her, nor are more than 1 of then attracted to her. If having one female character and lots of males qualifies at as a harem then fine, but if you're expecting fights over the girl you're in the wrong section again. \\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between the heroine and the male lead doesn't even heat up until well towards the end of the 1st season and into the second. This is about 4 years in the anime. Make no mistake, this is definitely a character and history piece. At the end of it all, Hakuouki is about the overthrow of the Shogunate and the people it affected.  It explores their relationships, their characters, and how far they are willing to go to survive in an era where samurai and ronin are a dying breed. \\n\\n\r\nI found the story outstanding. I enjoy character and history pieces and this is one of my favorite settings. The Art is well done and they actually animate the sword fights instead of just showing that one still shot of the character swinging his sword. The music is, obviously, not modern at all but it fits this piece fantastically. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a tad weak. Not so much the female lead, but in the males. However, this could be attributed to there being 10 males for every 1 female in this series. Most of the male characters end up staying in the background even if they are named because there just isn't enough time to get to all of them. To be honest, I confused 2 of the main male characters with each other until close to the end of the first season. They aren't annoying or unlikeable, quite the opposite, but they just are not very memorable. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a lot. I sat and devoured the first season in a sitting and am now working on the second. I am looking forward to the relationship between the male and female lead to finally blossom and I hope they have a happy ending!",

            "content": "This anime is one of the few rare decent reverse harem anime that exist. The fact that it was based on real life events may not seem original but it interprets them in its own way with supernatural twists added to it.  I have not played the game, but as an anime only watcher I found it could be a standalone anime adaptation. The events that happened made sense to me and there is sufficient explanation of why certain events took place.\r\nThe plot progression is at first quite slow, but it is understandable to take some time for world building and understanding the charactersand their motives better.\\n\r\nThe characters such as Hijikata Toshizo and Souji Okita were based on real life people in that era and if one has some background knowledge on them it may increase your enjoyment of this series. There is an added bonus of them all being very good looking as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe main female protagonist Yukimura Chizuru may be the weakest part of the story though. However, considering the era she lived in, she is actually quite brave to take the actions that she did. She also has an interesting backstory attached.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good thing in this anime is that the romance is not the most important thing to the story. Even if it is a reverse harem, it does not focus too much in the romance. There is no annoying cliche moments of being unable to decide which male interest she should choose. Her interactions with the other main characters other than the one she likes do not seem to be with romance in mind.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the beginning there is a mystery that needs to be solved in which everything is revealed later on. There are various bits of information that is revealed throughout the series. It is later in the series that it starts getting intense.  Even being prepared for it will not help. It is then you realise this is not like the typical reverse harem. Do not expect this to be a very fluffy slice of life anime. There are wars and conflicts happening all the time.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing to note is the action scenes. I was surprised to find the animation for the action scenes were pretty good. It is smooth and fluid, which is unexpected since this is supposed to be a shoujo anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that stood out for me was the ost. It is simply amazing. The atmospheric ost just fits the series perfectly. The songs are played just at the right moments and adds to the melancholic scenes. While the setting is already beautiful with cherry blossoms as a recurring theme, it forms a perfect harmony with the ost.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the whole series is when you would understand just why this series is good. This anime excels at beautiful sad moments and tragedy.\\n\\n",

It's a little old so i wasn't sure if the art styles would be as good as i am used too, on that account i was wrong to be concerned. Once i started watching it, i just loved it. The fighting is really well done and i like that the plot loosely follows historical events while adding in a good slice of fantasy. It was enough to keep my hooked the entire way threw. I don't think you have to be a girl toenjoy watching it either, although its certainly catered to that audience. If it has any major flaw, i agree with others who don't really like the female lead very much. Although i don't think she is so bad as deserve some of the criticism. She is a little washy washy at times but she also has good moments as well.",

Despite what most people would think, the fantasy and historical drama themes are woven together perfectly. The romance isn't exactly the best, mostly because it's just an afterthought in my opinion.\r\nThe story ties your thoughts on what the participants in war go through to protect their honor and country. Though like most historical dramas, it's a real tear jerker. The plot makes it so that you start to understand what the characters are feeling throughout the many battles they fight.\r\nOne of the downsides to the anime was that Yukimura Chizuru can'treally protect herself. It makes sense, yes, but I have yet to find a good historical anime that features a female protagonist that doesn't constantly need saving.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is very enjoyable and has a well-thought story.",

            "content": "First of all, I played the game. I'm totally not an otome fan, to be honest, when one of my friends suggested me to play it, I was totally scared. I was a little prejudiced like \"It's a dating sim. How on earth can a dating sim have a really good story?\". But then she started to speak about the historical references, how it takes place during the Bakumatsu (I think this part of Japanese history is one of the most interesting ones), and then I decided to play. And the game is great. It really has a complex story line with philosophy, a reallydeep message, symbolism, history, good voice acting... in the end, I realised, I just couldn't care it was a dating sim.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then I started watching the anime. Honestly, that game is hard to adapt. Every storyline shows one character, developes his story, and in the anime, they can't use all the storylines, they have to decide what to exclude, and what is important. And Hakuouki didn't do too well in it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is not bad, but not really good. For example, Hijikata's face is absolutely the \"romantic good guy\" face. It's awfully hard to believe, that he is a strict leader, that he can be fearsome when he has that face. Saito, who is my personal favourite character, in the game had a greyish-blackish hair, which is quite realistic for a japanese guy (even if the blue, green and purple eyes are still a little bit absurd) and what about the anime? Purple. Really, I laughed so hard on that hair that I wasn't able to take the character seriously. And there is Chizuru, whose face is somehow... carelessly drawn? I don't know how to say it, but her face is weird. The motions are alright, the landscapes are beautiful, but they can't really make up for some mistakes of the character animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, again, a big problem, especially, if someone played the game, which had really enchanting soundtracks. The anime has some scenes, where the sound is stunning. Really, especially Souji's scenes, I loved it, but most of the time, de soundtrack is just there, and you don't care. Nothing extra, and you certainly won't remember it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the characters: They are still great. There is not enough time, to introduce and develope everyone, but this is just the first season. I personally think, who was portrayed outstandingly well, was Souji. From his dark humor and agressivity, trough his tragedy, to his amazing bravery, everything was spot on. If someone could take Saito seriously with that hair, he was also great, and Hijikata was highly censored (he spoke with much worse language in the game), but he was still alright. Harada and Heisuke didn't have enough time, I felt, but I could forgive, since the whole season was only 12 episodes. And there was a big problem, and that is Chizuru. In the game her character is not annoying, and it's great. She is somehow believable, as someone who really wants to help the Shinsengumi, she is quite useful, and not totally stupid. While in the anime, she is plain annoying. She can't do anything, always needs to be protected, has an impossibly high voice... I don't know why the creators of the story made her this annoying, but they did wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is full of historical facts, and the fantasy elements are just a great add to it. They have a mythological background, and they fit into the plot, and don't turn illogical. What makes this anime really good, and worth a watch is absolutely it's story.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have the chance to play a game, play it, before watching the anime, but if you don't have the chance, this story is really worth a watch. It is interesting, creative, and has some amazing characters and ideas.",

            "content": "Chizuru's story starts off in quite a common manner ( minus the rounin who are chasing her for reasons unknown ). Her father goes missing and she decides that it's been far too long since she heard from him so armed with a sword and a boy's attire, she sets out. Only to attract the attention of rounin who have nothing better do than chase a \"boy\" who did nothing to them ( I still have no idea why they were chasing her but well, rounin are rounin and we need something to start off with ). \r\nMuch to Chizuru's horror, the rounin are cutdown by demon-like men, their hair gleaming white in the dark of the night. And they're about to cut her down too, when three men suddenly appear and save the day. But no, these men are not your conventional heroes. They are part of the Shinsengumi, a group of \"police officers\" whom the general population share no feelings of camaraderie for, at that time, a rebellion was slowly stirring. \\n\\n\r\nChizuru is handled none-too-gently for witnessing what happened and the Vice-Commander, Hijikata Toushizou is convinced that \"he\" must be killed. The gentle Commander, Kondou Isami is hesitant and we are slowly introduced to the other characters at this point. Okita Souji, Saitou Hajime, Harada Sanosuke, Toudou Heisuke, Nagakura Shinpachi and Sannan Keisuke. Chizuru is saved by the fact that the Shinsengumi too, is searching for her father and they they agree to keep her with them until he is found. \\n\\n\r\nHakuouki is a historical anime and still surprisingly, all the main male characters are models of the real-life people, apart from Sannan-san.  One thing that you'll love about the anime is the male characters. All of them, while fiercely protective of Chizuru, do not display what typical reverse harem boys do. They don't constantly try to grab her attention or sweep her off her feet, only trying to cheer her up and sharing their true feelings with her. If there are any special feelings, the boys give way to the canon couple because there is no time to fight over love when everything they've been fighting for is falling apart. \\n\\n\r\nChizuru, while spending time with the group, discovers quite accidentally exactly why the Shinsengumi are searching for her father and is shocked. A not-so-chance meeting with a mysterious blond who is after her reveals much about herself that even she had no idea about. \\n\\n\r\nMost people describe Chizuru as a spineless character who is of absolutely no use but I think that's exactly what she exists for - to bring out the best of the male characters. It's true that she's mostly unable to fight for herself, having to constantly depend on others but it's not exactly her fault. She has the ability to move on and tries her best to help others. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime managed to capture my attention with the events that were going on. Slowly but surely, the cogs of fate began to turn and started breaking down the protective shield that made the Shinsengumi what it was. Hakuouki is not at all the sparkles and rainbows it appears to be. The events of the anime faithfully follow what happened in real life and then you begin to realise that victory doesn't come as easily as it appears to. \\n\\n\r\nEven so, Hakuouki is intriguing exactly because of that. Enemies and evil are not black and white. It's a blend of colours, never singular and that's exactly what the inevitable war that the Shinsengumi are about to face is. The end of this first season points towards more bloodshed, tragedy and unfortunate events. At this point of time, can they keep holding on?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not one-sided. They have flaws, their own personalities and they make decisions that might not always be the right thing. Their lives, quite refreshingly, do not centre around the female lead and the choices they make might, at times, be surprising. If you're someone like me who has a strong interest in historical events, then Hakuouki is the anime for you. It explores what happened in a truly gripping way. \\n\\n\r\nI fell in love with the OP and ED but the OSTs are quite mediocre. The voice acting, however, was superb and the characters were really expressed well, especially Okita's voice, which I really fell in love with and Chikage, whom Tsuda Kenjirou-san voiced ( I absolutely loved him as Spanner ). \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was one of the strong points, in my opinion, Hakuouki is rightfully not tagged reverse harem but the bishounen quality is still there and the colours are kind of dark-themed, there aren't really any bright colours. \\n\\n\r\nHakuouki, as the first part of the series, did a wonderful job of introducing the characters to us.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not just fans of historical anime, I honestly don't think action fans will be disappointed by this either and if you're a huge fan of romance, then Hakuouki will definitely fulfill your thirst for it. Masochistic people ( like me ) who just can't stop watching tragedies, then, this, surprisingly might just be your cup of tea.",

            "content": "*Spoiler warning* Do not read story section unless you've finished the series.\r\n\"Hakuouki\" is based on a PS2 romance adventure otome game (games targeted toward girls).\r\nThe story starts with Yukimura Chizuru, daughter of a doctor in Edo (Tokyo's old name), arriving Kyoto in search of her father. She is saved by two Shinsengumi members from zombie-like demon, and gets taken into custody. Eventually she gains their trust and helps them out while looking for clues of her father.\r\nShinsengumi is an organization that actually existed in the late-Edo-period that acted as a 'special police' that served to suppress any anti-government movement in Kyoto. The actual organization onlyexisted for less than a decade, but their legacies have been depicted in various novels, movies, and TV doramas that they have become something of a symbol of justice in the Edo-era. The latest Shinsengumi hit has been the NHK Taiga dorama \"Shinsengumi!\" starring SMAP's Katori Shingo in 2004. NHK, the government-owned TV station's Taiga dorama series are known for practically guaranteed 15%+ viewership ratings and A-list actors.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime's events and characters are inspired by the actual Shinsengumi, but the story is completely fictional.\\n\r\nThe title \"Hakuouki\" is a made-up word comprised of kanji \"Light-colored Sakura\" and \"Ogre\". It describes the fictional vampire-like white-haired (light color) undead (Sakura) demons (ogres) in this series. Sakura (Cherry blossoms) symbolizes death or short-lived beauty for the short span in which the pink flowers blossom in spring. (Sakura also symbolizes farewells and new meetings since they bloom during graduation and new school year, which is April in Japan, but that is probably not the case in this series)\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION:\\n\r\nAnimation in general lacked detail, and characters' faces were really deformed in some scenes while they were extremely well-drawn in close up and action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing they really succeeded in this show was use of lighting to create mood. From hazy moonlight to orange glow in the daytime to bloody red sunset, the light always seemed to shine from one direction, and matched the atmosphere they were trying to create.\\n\\n\r\nOne fatal flaw in the animation... was character design in the sense that they were all too idolized. Sure, all the main characters wore Shinsengumi uniforms with swords around their waist, but all I saw was a bunch of host and a school girl in cosplay. It all comes down to fan service, and they all seemed out of place amid peasants and lowly Shinsengumi members who looked legitimately from the Edo-era.\\n\r\nThey even went as far as trying to have Chizuru pass for a boy. I know back in the day, it was unthinkable for a girl to be dressed like a boy, but please, you must be joking.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nMain characters looked like hosts, at least they sounded like hosts too. Despite the fact that they were totally out of place, they stayed consistent by speaking modern Japanese the whole way and and all the characters sounded like they should.\\n\\n\r\nMusic in slice-of-life scenes had a serene, calming flow that worked very nicely in the background, which intensified in plot twists or confrontations, enhancing drama in every occasion. Powerful drum beats are added in action scenes, which not only fit the era well, but also made them all that more exciting.\\n\\n\r\nTheme songs were ridiculously good for this series. OP song was epic with extremely catchy tune, elegant lyric, and great vocal. Amazing piece of contemporary Jpop-Enka hybrid that really blew me away. ED was pretty good, the somber song worked nicely for this series since many episodes ended with a tragedy. Sound and Marketing department sure have a lot of work ahead of them if they're to match or surpass the theme song quality and compatibility in season 2.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY/CHARACTER:\\n\r\nBefore we even get to the story... there was a major problem with power balance in this anime. I can accept Oni villains being insanely strong because they're not human, but how are some of the Shinsengumi members able to fight almost evenly against them? What's even more puzzling is that those fighters struggle against lowly samurai when outnumbered. From their performance against the Oni, they should be able to easily defeat 10 minions by themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThis leads to the main problem with the story: Irrational character motives and too much sudden story developments between events.\\n\\n\r\n- Oni can so easily penetrate Shinsengumi's defense, as proven by Kazama and Nagumo. Why didn't they just come in and kidnap Chizuru anytime they wanted? There was nothing there to stop them from second or third tries after the first attempt failed. (Why did it even take that long to make the first attempt?)\\n\\n\r\n- I didn't exactly see how Chizuru fell in love with Hijikata. Seemed just like Hijikata was being excessively strict few times, and got persuaded by other members to bend the rules. It was a WTF moment for me when Chizuru started blushing when her twin sister asked her if she's staying for love.\\n\\n\r\n- Overly gullible characters. Gets tricked so easily by villains and has no self-discipline when given the choice with the elixir. These guys are definitely not leader materials, and it's a wonder Shinsengumi can last so long with such incompetent commanders.\\n\\n\r\n- You're trying to kill Chizuru for seeing a classified subject, and the next second, you're trusting her to send messages in a life-or-death situation.\\n\\n\r\n- Chizuru, do not walk toward vampires when you're bleeding! Use common sense.\\n\r\n- Chizuru, run when you see danger! You're helpless, and you staying around is not going to help the injured or dead.\\n\r\n- Chizuru, PLEASE TRY TO ACTIVATE SELF-DEFENSE INSTINCT OF YOUR BRAIN! Help will not always arrive out of blue.\\n\\n\r\n- Hijikata drinking elixir in the last episode came out nowhere. Where did he even get it? And his motive makes no sense, I mean... you're not human anymore, just because someone (who you knew didn't kill your best friend) provoked you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMaking a non-cheesy fictional story based on historical events is difficult. Add vampires, Oni, rushed storyline, and this feat becomes practically impossible.\\n\\n\r\nThe least they could've done was provide more backgrounds to each incident rather than \"XXX advanced their troops to Kyoto\", battle scene, \"And this will eventually come to be known as Battle of YYY\" before jumping to another historical event.\\n\\n\r\nI think they should've just used the Edo-era setting with original events rather than try to camouflage an actual event.\\n\\n\r\nThe DBZ-style talking during battles, or talking for so long that backup arrive certainly didn't make the story any more believable.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL:\\n\r\nAnother unrealistic jidaigeki, I would have to say this is girl's version of \"Sengoku Basara\". Instead of mindless battles, you have mindless melodrama, which starts to get pretty predictable even without knowledge of Japanese history. In the end, it was a bidanshi cosplay fest, as expected of a shoujo anime. The story jumps from one historical battle to another, it's easy to tell this is just another \"Rurouni Kenshin\"-inspired piece that hopped on bandwagon of the latest Shinsengumi craze initiated by the 2004 NHK Taiga dorama.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I have to say that the characters are charming as intended, and the Oni villains are cool enough to have me watch this season to the end, and if I have a lot of time to kill, I'll be able to tolerate another season just to see how bad it gets.",

            "content": "Ignoring the fact it's been a game, and the main female character is the most frustrating, ignorant and helpless ever, this is a brilliant anime. \r\nEven if you find the story a little...sparse at times, the reason you should /definitely/ watch to the end of every single episode is the male characters - both the drawing of them and the personalities themselves. They aren't, like a lot of mangas based on games, guys who may be hot but are stupid, masochistic and aloof. They are warm, funny, incredibly good looking (a major bonus) and, of course, incredibly protective of the female protagonist.\r\nChizuru (the female protagonist)is the only reason (alongside the plot sometimes having holes big enough to drive a truck through) you might find this a little tiresome. She is, considering her 'powers' (something you'll find out about) incredibly helpless and unable to fend for herself - something I find most INFURIATING in girl characters.\\n\r\nI sticked through it because I thought there would be some sort of 'Kick-ass' moment where she'd begin to shine, but so far nil-but maybe there is hope for the second series?\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the guys do make up for it tenfold. A few I feel I should mention is Saitou, Okita and Heisuke.\\n\r\nSaitou is just...brilliant. He's more than adequate for man candy but also a brilliant swordsman and very smart. One of your serious glasses types (but obviously without the glasses)\\n\r\nOkita is a lovely character, he gets fleshed out a lot more than the others seem to (for instance, from what I can gather so far it seems as if she's getting together with Hijikata, but nothing has been developed in his character for you to warm to him at all.). I really enjoyed the episodes with him involved, and he's a sight for sore eyes!\\n\r\nHeisuke is my personal favourite. He's the youngest, same age as Chizuru, but utterly brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, you should watch for the fight scenes (guys), and the man candy (girls) and just the characters! I highly recommend it.",

            "content": "Hakuouki is an anime made by Studio DEEN, who have, in recent years, gained infamy for putting their names to a variety of very poor shows in recent years, as well as making a horribly butchered adaptation of Umineko. So, does Hakuouki enter the ranks of awful DEEN series, or does it redeem the studio? Well, put simply, it is terrible. It is a perfect example of why DEEN are a bad studio. There isn't a single good thing about it.\r\nBut before I get into the details about why Hakuouki is horrible, let's just sum up what Hakuouki is about for those not familiar withthe series. The series is introduced with a young \"boy\" trying to escape from a strange vampire-like demon. At the last minute, \"he\" is saved by a group of samurai, who then take \"him\" hostage. As it turns out, the \"boy\" has seen more than he should have done, and is now being held captive by a large group of suspiciously attractive men. As it also turns out, the boy is named Chizuru and is not a boy, and is a girl disguising as one. If this sounds clich\u00e9 to you then that's probably because it is.\\n\\n\r\nAs it turns out, Chizuru is looking for her father, a doctor who went missing in Kyoto. Later on, it turns out that her father is involved with the medicine that turns men into the aforementioned vampires that are never once called vampires in spite of being nocturnal creatures once human but now superhuman who lust after human blood.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the biggest problem with Hakuouki is, rather simply, that it is boring. Throughout the entire 12 episodes, the show held my interest for maybe 5 seconds at most. Despite being a show about swordsmen and demons, there is very little action. While a similar statement can be made of Saraiya Goyou, a similarly themed show that aired at the same time, the fact is that while the latter keeps the viewer's interest with a quirky style, fascinating dialogue, and originality, Hakuouki does nothing of the sort. Hakuouki is rather bland, having no real selling point other than the cast of bishonens. Stylistically, the themes that run through Hakuouki have been done before many times, and better. And the worst complaint that can be said of it is the dialogue. Hakuouki is an adaptation of a visual novel, but it doesn't seem to understand the \"adaptation\" part of that. Everything in this show is just talking. The action is almost never focused on, and is completely weightless when it is. The plot has no intrigue or suspense. It is just talking. This could have been forgiveable, but even worse is that the dialogue isn't even good. It's just boring and lifeless, and it begs the question of why this was taken from a VN at all when it simply acts exactly like one.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I said before that the selling point of the show is the bishonens, but there's a problem with that too. As a heterosexual male, I know that I am not the target audience, but there are still some clear problems even taking that into account. For a start, there isn't a single character in this show with a likeable or memorable character trait. Every single one of them is completely one-dimensional. None of them are developed on, very few of them go through any kind of personal struggle, and at the end of it almost every character is simply forgettable. To make things worse, the character design in Hakuouki is extremely weak. It is often completely impossible to tell one character apart from another, with them all being uniformed, alongside many of them sharing various features with other characters, and combined with my previous complaint it can often make the show confusing out of a lack of basic knowledge for which character is which.\\n\\n\r\nThe only character who is actually worth mentioning here is Chizuru, the shoddily disguised centre of our reverse-harem. But don't mistake my meaning, she is by no means a good character. For the most part, she is only memorable simply for being the only girl. But due to her being in focus, unlike 90% of the cast, she becomes memorable, and her faults become noticeable. For one, she does not help the plot at all for most of the series, except towards the end, in which her only role is to become a living MacGuffin that the enemy forces want. When thrown into combat, she is completely useless, and seems to have no self-defence instinct whatsoever, leading other characters to become injured in her stead while she just stands there.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is one of the few moments where the show is actually interesting, but it may also be the worst for the complete contradictions we are shown. Now, I don't want to spoil anybody, but it's going to be hard to discuss the ending without doing so, so if you are particularly spoiler-sensitive and want to watch this series for whatever reason, I would advise you to skip the rest of this paragraph. Basically, one of the samurai is killed in front of Chizuru, and a member of the enemy force is nearby at the time, though he was not the one responsible. Another member of the samurai sees this, blames the demon, and drinks the potion that turns people into the not-vampire creatures so he will have the strength to kill him. Now, there are several problems with this. For a start, a very curious question is raised... where did he get the potion? The potion is not supposed to be easily accessible, for obvious reasons. He had no reason to plan for an event like this, so he would not have prepared it. There is no foreshadowing or reason that suggests he was already considering the change. It simply doesn't make sense. But on top of that, after the battle, he reveals that he knew that the man wasn't responsible for his death. Which now means that the drinker just sentenced himself to a life as an undead monster to get revenge on a man he knew wasn't even responsible.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, Hakuouki repeatedly proves itself to be a terrible show without a single redeeming feature, but just to put the cherry on top, DEEN are giving it a sequel in the fall. Yes, you heard that right... somehow, this mess of an anime has gathered enough of a fanbase to warrant a sequel. So sadly, we haven't even seen the end of this series.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure I've made this clear by now, but my verdict on this anime is simply a no. It does not deserve to be watched by anybody, and if there is any justice in the world it will have been completely forgotten by the end of the year... at least if DEEN don't end up making a third series.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: I'd have more fun watching paint dry.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Graphics: 3/10\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 1/10\\n\r\nMusic/Background: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10",

This is from the perspective of someone who only watched the anime.\r\nStory: 10\r\nI really enjoyed the story. The historic content was interesting. The added elements of Rasetsu and the conflicts with the Oni were also captivating. There was nothing with the story that bothered me, and I didn't feel bored, not even once. I usually don't watch Shoujo anime because I hate sappy romance and girly stuff, but this anime was an exception. There were no scenes with girls crying that they love this and that. Chizuruwas more like a member of the Shinsengumi. There was even action and sword-fighting, and that was entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nIt was amazing. The characters looked perfect. The scenery was great. The fight scenes were animated well also. Nothing to complain about here. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nEnding and opening sequences had nice songs that fit the anime. Sounds during the anime blended in well also.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nI really like each Shinsengumi member. They all had different, but intriguing personalities. I would like to be around them, they were cool. The only character that bothered me was Chizuru. She tried to help out the Shinsengumi, but I still think she was a scaredy-cat. She couldn't protect herself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nWhat else can I say? It was one of my favorite animes. I even want to play the video game and read the manga now.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nThis anime is worth it to watch!",

The story line is pretty much what the synopsis is! I think this anime has great potential because the art, music, personality of each character is so interesting. I thought that the artwork was somewhat dark and yet tranquil. If you like SWORDS+SAMURAI ISH+VAMPIRES/OGRE this is the anime for you. Also! I'm so into the traditional Japanese historical setting. I think it connects the past for us viewers to relate to culture. Andi did do some research on the characters it turns out some of the characters are actual people that were military leaders so I thought that was SOOO COOL!  \\n\\n\r\nThe opening has some hints on why I think the anime is going to do well. It hinted that there are going to be a lot of battles and each character will unfold their own tale. So I hope this helps you anime lovers. I really do love it and it's nice to finally see some hot boys fight with swords and transform into vampires if they drink this \"medicine.\" :D\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of Romance, i don't want to say it is a typical romance story but in a way it is. The main female character is taken away and being protected by men. She is in a way imprisoned and kidnapped or forced against her will. Now i'm assuming love with unfold with one of the men so which is why this is a very successful romance story. If anyone reads old romance novels in general and if you don't then  what makes a romance novel successful is a female usually gets kidnaped/forced to stay somewhere. At first the female will resent the men but slowly their kindness reveals and they end up falling in love. So mY PREDICTION is that this will also happen. Obviously though. haha but what i'm saying is this is \"considered\" a successful romance story based on what I've seen so far!!\\n\\n\r\n-I apologize if this didn't help! This is like my second time writing a review~~ ^^* enjoy though!",

            "content": "After having watched 5 episodes of Hakuouki I feel at liberty to write that this is an excellent anime, worth every minute you take to watch it. \r\nThe story is good so far. Although not yet fully disclosed, it looks better as you watch each episode. I absolutely love the historical genre, and all the political turmoil taking place in the 19th century. I may be partial to the genre, but it evokes a constant feel of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, so I cannot go higher.\r\nThe main (male) characters (members of Kondo faction of Shinsengumi) are all named after real members of the faction. Other than that,they are quite typical, and there's really nothing out of the ordinary in this department. Despite the fact that this anime takes the road already travelled in the portrayal of characters, it does it good. The characters are neither boring nor two-dimensional, and they have their respective personalities. It would be a sin not to mention the fact that there's a bunch of angry, virtuous sword-wielders who are beautiful, and that the main female character is not too annoying or too incapable of action.\\n\r\nI guess I should elaborate on my overall grade. Truth being told, if I wasn\u2019t writing this review I would have given it an 8 or a 9. Because, when I don\u2019t review a series I\u2019m mostly governed by the level of enjoyment in grading it. After careful consideration, it is impossible to give it more than 7, because Hakuouki is obviously a series made for the sake of pure enjoyment.\\n",

            "content": "its still too early to say how the anime will turn out to be, I mean we are just through with episode 1. I am already seeing mixed to awesome reviews for this anime series. And why not? Its a famous \"Neo-Romance\" game, which has been turned into an anime now, with Bishies as the center point. Although I do have mixed feelings for this one as we already know how the previous Neo-Romance animes have ended, for example La Corda D'oro. The female protagonist never ends up with any guy, a real DISAPPOINTMENT for romance enthusiasts like me :(. I am hoping this isn'tgonna happen here because even if the anime is having Romance as the central point, the historical & Political plot makes it more interesting (at least compared to a musical romance like Corda).\\n\\n\r\nStory -9\\n\r\nThe main plot is about the main protagonist searching for her missing father and gets the help of the Shinsengumi. While helping her almost all the guys fall for her. Sounds very much like Corda, but here comes the difference, there are some mysterious secrets that the Shinsengumi are hiding for Chizuru, our main female lead. What is the Shinsengumi being so secretive about? Why keep a female disguised as a male in their group? And why are the Shinsengumi so keen on discovering Chizuru's missing father? What do they really want from Chizuru? These are some questions like these that left me hanging and craving for more :).\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nIn one word the art is beautiful (Kire desu). Its awesomely gorgeous with the way the creators have captured the background of historical time Japan. I'm sure we can look forward some more marvelous action sequence and pictorial beauty in the coming up episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nSound seems very apt with the anime, especially the fight sequences. Although its still the start but the OP and ED are really cool songs and maybe you can check the soundtracks of this PS2 game online. I have heard some of the OST's and they are really good. Five stars ***** for music\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -9\\n\r\nWell I could have given it a 10 because of the bishies, but let's be real, bishies always look so dishy, especially in dating Sim changed into an anime series. So I tried to hold my bias here, but yes the characters look more real then in a 2-D game for sure :D.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nOK, Bishies, history,politics with romance being the center plot and some comedy, drama and action thrown in between, you've got an almost perfect \"Gourmet Delight\" of entertainment served.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8\\n\r\nYeah, the rating may change because we are just minus one episode so you never know ;)!!! I am looking forward to it, cant wait for the next one. MUST WATCH, that's all I can say for now.\\n",

            "content": "Story. 7\r\nIt's a good setup, if you like reverse-harem.  A young girl in search of her father is taken in by a group of warriors that is also searching for him.  However, the plot didn't really advance all that fast.  Certainly the political situation was constantly evolving, but in terms of what was going on the heroine, she was basically a bystander who did almost nothing.\r\nArt. 9\r\nBeautiful art, especially character design.  And the fight scenes were surprisingly decent, for a reverse-harem.  Fangirls who like guys with silver hair will be especially pleased.\r\nSound. 6\r\nThe soundtrack worked fine with the show, butthere were no melodies that stood out to me.  Not something I'd choose to listen to on its own.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter. 8\\n\r\nI think character would get a 7 if not for Okita.  The heroine was extremely boring and typical, the usual weak anime girl who is protected at every moment and does absolutely nothing for herself.  I was fairly disappointed.  I had real expectations for her development, but she was a lot like Yuki from Vampire Knight.  Even after you find out she's a bit special, she doesn't do a single interesting thing.  What's more, she often puts people in danger inadvertently because she can't stay put.  Considering that her father was a doctor, at the very least she could have had some real medical knowledge, but all you see her doing is occasionally wrapping bandages.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. 6\\n\r\nIn retrospect, I'm surprised I got through it.  Until the very end, I was expecting the heroine to do something.  I've seen enough anime at this point that I should've known better.  Still, I'm a big fan of the reverse harem genre, and I had a weak spot for both Okita and Kazama.\\n\\n\r\nOverall. 7\\n\r\nI've suffered way more through other shows.  That's why it gets a 7 even though I didn't get much out of it.  I do not recommend this to guys.  I do not recommend this to girls who like strong heroines.  If you need comedy in your anime, or strong plot, it's also not for you.  And there weren't enough fights to satisfy someone who likes a lot of swordplay in their shows.  This is really just for reverse-harem/bishounen/vampire fans and maybe those who are especially into artistically beautiful anime regardless of content.",

            "content": "I really wanted to like Hakuouki since it presents a lot of interesting ideas.  Ultimately however, Hakuouki never decides on a main plot.  Instead it flirts with subplot after subplot, ultimately failing to adequately develop or resolve any of them.  \r\nStory - 3/10 (Poor)\r\nThe story is difficult to describe, because of the apparent lack of one.  The anime begins with Chizuru, our appointed \"protagonist\", leaving her home and venturing to a city foreign to her in order to find her father.  With this kind of opening, you'd expect that this quest would make up a significant portion of the anime.After all, it is Chizuru's main motivation.  Instead, Chizuru meets the Shinsengumi and she becomes merely the observer of their deeds, without having any real impact on their actions.  \\n\\n\r\nOf course, she's supposed to be relevant and there is a story line to suggest she's the most important person in the series, complete with high-powered \"evil\" after her.  However, like the rest of the subplots, it is never really developed, fully explained, or concluded.  \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that Chizuru is merely an observer for most of the anime could be acceptable.  The Shinsengumi are embroiled in enough martial actions and political intrigue, not to mention a fair number of secrets, to carry the show.  However, like Chizuru's story line, their actions are disjointed, never flushed out, and lack an overarching narrative.  To the show's detriment, it's never really made clear what they're fighting for.  Flushing out the ever present camaraderie of the Shinsengumi's members, perhaps giving a bit of background to their relationships with each other, would make their sacrifices and the ending meaningful.  As it is, the conclusion doesn't conclude anything and all the noble actions of the Shinsengumi are left feeling hollow.  \\n\\n\r\nArt - 6 (Fair)\\n\r\nThe characters look nice, vibrant, and fairly distinct from one another.  Everything else is entirely forgettable.  \\n\\n\r\nSound - 6 (Fair)\\n\r\nNothing's wrong with the sound, but nothing stands out either.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6 (Fair)\\n\r\nThe characters are easily the best thing about this anime.  While Chizuru herself is the typical damsel in distress heroine, she isn't as annoying as some.  Of course, that is mainly due to the fact that she is overshadowed by the Shinsengumi.  The members of the Shinsengumi, while falling into the typical stereotypes, are given a sense of depth through their relationships with each other and their own individual conflicts.  \\n\\n\r\nI would rate the characters higher, but again the lack of a cohesive plot gets in the way.  Many of these characters have subplots of their own that begin to flesh them out and make them genuinely likable.  However, all of their stories are only partially developed then ignored completely.  Which begs the question, why bother?  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5 (Mediocre)\\n\r\nThe lack of a solid driving force behind the events that occur in Hakuouki is a serious detraction and gets in the way of enjoying what the series does well.  Even though the camaraderie between the Shinsengumi is interesting to watch, the fact that the conflicts faced by each member are summarily dismissed without resolution makes any attachment to the characters seem irrelevant.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5 (Mediocre)\\n\r\nHakuouki tries to do too much and in the end fails to deliver anything noteworthy.  Perhaps if you've played/read the source material, you may find more enjoyment out of it.  I am only considering the anime as it stands.  There seems to be a sequel that may rectify the lack of any resolution to the plot, but considering how bafflingly mishandled the story development was in the 12 episodes this series was allotted, I don't have my hopes up.  Overall, if you're interested in this anime, I suggest to wait for the sequel and see if its plot/subplots are sorted out in that one, otherwise you're bound to be disappointed.",

            "content": "I've seen a lot of negative reviews on this anime citing that it's boring, there is too much history, not enough action and so on. Frankly, you're in the wrong section. If you read a description and don't recognize the time periods or groups the anime is using, don't downrate it because you are ignorant of history. \r\nNow, that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. It's set in a very similar time period to Rurouni Kenshin except Hakuouki is set before and during the revolution. It revolves around a girl named Chizuru who left Edo to search for her father in Kyoto. While there,she runs into the Shinsengumi (who you may also remember from Kenshin) and they decide to keep her around because her father is the doctor they are looking for. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of criticism for Chizuru's character. That she is a \"Mary-Sue\" and is weak. This anime is set in 1863 in a realistic Japanese backdrop. I don't think the women's rights movement had quite made it over there yet, folks. Chizuru is already walking the line by dressing like a man and carrying a sword for 99% of the show. Expecting her to suddenly turn into the ultra warrior during the age of samurai vs. bullets is, frankly, unrealistic. Keeping this in mind, I did find her character likeable. She really does do everything in her power to protect those around her and help as much as she can, despite being female. I can think of maybe 2 instances where she was \"annoying\" and both are easily made up for and forgotten. Chizuru also hides a powerful secret in her heritage that makes her wanted by several different groups hunting her. \\n\\n\r\nThe bulk of the rest of the cast is made up of bishonen and random soldiers. This anime is often classified as a \"reverse harem\" but I really don't see that. These guys do not fight over her, nor are more than 1 of then attracted to her. If having one female character and lots of males qualifies at as a harem then fine, but if you're expecting fights over the girl you're in the wrong section again. \\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between the heroine and the male lead doesn't even heat up until well towards the end of the 1st season and into the second. This is about 4 years in the anime. Make no mistake, this is definitely a character and history piece. At the end of it all, Hakuouki is about the overthrow of the Shogunate and the people it affected.  It explores their relationships, their characters, and how far they are willing to go to survive in an era where samurai and ronin are a dying breed. \\n\\n\r\nI found the story outstanding. I enjoy character and history pieces and this is one of my favorite settings. The Art is well done and they actually animate the sword fights instead of just showing that one still shot of the character swinging his sword. The music is, obviously, not modern at all but it fits this piece fantastically. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a tad weak. Not so much the female lead, but in the males. However, this could be attributed to there being 10 males for every 1 female in this series. Most of the male characters end up staying in the background even if they are named because there just isn't enough time to get to all of them. To be honest, I confused 2 of the main male characters with each other until close to the end of the first season. They aren't annoying or unlikeable, quite the opposite, but they just are not very memorable. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a lot. I sat and devoured the first season in a sitting and am now working on the second. I am looking forward to the relationship between the male and female lead to finally blossom and I hope they have a happy ending!",

            "content": "This anime is one of the few rare decent reverse harem anime that exist. The fact that it was based on real life events may not seem original but it interprets them in its own way with supernatural twists added to it.  I have not played the game, but as an anime only watcher I found it could be a standalone anime adaptation. The events that happened made sense to me and there is sufficient explanation of why certain events took place.\r\nThe plot progression is at first quite slow, but it is understandable to take some time for world building and understanding the charactersand their motives better.\\n\r\nThe characters such as Hijikata Toshizo and Souji Okita were based on real life people in that era and if one has some background knowledge on them it may increase your enjoyment of this series. There is an added bonus of them all being very good looking as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe main female protagonist Yukimura Chizuru may be the weakest part of the story though. However, considering the era she lived in, she is actually quite brave to take the actions that she did. She also has an interesting backstory attached.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good thing in this anime is that the romance is not the most important thing to the story. Even if it is a reverse harem, it does not focus too much in the romance. There is no annoying cliche moments of being unable to decide which male interest she should choose. Her interactions with the other main characters other than the one she likes do not seem to be with romance in mind.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the beginning there is a mystery that needs to be solved in which everything is revealed later on. There are various bits of information that is revealed throughout the series. It is later in the series that it starts getting intense.  Even being prepared for it will not help. It is then you realise this is not like the typical reverse harem. Do not expect this to be a very fluffy slice of life anime. There are wars and conflicts happening all the time.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing to note is the action scenes. I was surprised to find the animation for the action scenes were pretty good. It is smooth and fluid, which is unexpected since this is supposed to be a shoujo anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that stood out for me was the ost. It is simply amazing. The atmospheric ost just fits the series perfectly. The songs are played just at the right moments and adds to the melancholic scenes. While the setting is already beautiful with cherry blossoms as a recurring theme, it forms a perfect harmony with the ost.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the whole series is when you would understand just why this series is good. This anime excels at beautiful sad moments and tragedy.\\n\\n",

It's a little old so i wasn't sure if the art styles would be as good as i am used too, on that account i was wrong to be concerned. Once i started watching it, i just loved it. The fighting is really well done and i like that the plot loosely follows historical events while adding in a good slice of fantasy. It was enough to keep my hooked the entire way threw. I don't think you have to be a girl toenjoy watching it either, although its certainly catered to that audience. If it has any major flaw, i agree with others who don't really like the female lead very much. Although i don't think she is so bad as deserve some of the criticism. She is a little washy washy at times but she also has good moments as well.",

Despite what most people would think, the fantasy and historical drama themes are woven together perfectly. The romance isn't exactly the best, mostly because it's just an afterthought in my opinion.\r\nThe story ties your thoughts on what the participants in war go through to protect their honor and country. Though like most historical dramas, it's a real tear jerker. The plot makes it so that you start to understand what the characters are feeling throughout the many battles they fight.\r\nOne of the downsides to the anime was that Yukimura Chizuru can'treally protect herself. It makes sense, yes, but I have yet to find a good historical anime that features a female protagonist that doesn't constantly need saving.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is very enjoyable and has a well-thought story.",

            "content": "First of all, I played the game. I'm totally not an otome fan, to be honest, when one of my friends suggested me to play it, I was totally scared. I was a little prejudiced like \"It's a dating sim. How on earth can a dating sim have a really good story?\". But then she started to speak about the historical references, how it takes place during the Bakumatsu (I think this part of Japanese history is one of the most interesting ones), and then I decided to play. And the game is great. It really has a complex story line with philosophy, a reallydeep message, symbolism, history, good voice acting... in the end, I realised, I just couldn't care it was a dating sim.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then I started watching the anime. Honestly, that game is hard to adapt. Every storyline shows one character, developes his story, and in the anime, they can't use all the storylines, they have to decide what to exclude, and what is important. And Hakuouki didn't do too well in it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is not bad, but not really good. For example, Hijikata's face is absolutely the \"romantic good guy\" face. It's awfully hard to believe, that he is a strict leader, that he can be fearsome when he has that face. Saito, who is my personal favourite character, in the game had a greyish-blackish hair, which is quite realistic for a japanese guy (even if the blue, green and purple eyes are still a little bit absurd) and what about the anime? Purple. Really, I laughed so hard on that hair that I wasn't able to take the character seriously. And there is Chizuru, whose face is somehow... carelessly drawn? I don't know how to say it, but her face is weird. The motions are alright, the landscapes are beautiful, but they can't really make up for some mistakes of the character animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, again, a big problem, especially, if someone played the game, which had really enchanting soundtracks. The anime has some scenes, where the sound is stunning. Really, especially Souji's scenes, I loved it, but most of the time, de soundtrack is just there, and you don't care. Nothing extra, and you certainly won't remember it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the characters: They are still great. There is not enough time, to introduce and develope everyone, but this is just the first season. I personally think, who was portrayed outstandingly well, was Souji. From his dark humor and agressivity, trough his tragedy, to his amazing bravery, everything was spot on. If someone could take Saito seriously with that hair, he was also great, and Hijikata was highly censored (he spoke with much worse language in the game), but he was still alright. Harada and Heisuke didn't have enough time, I felt, but I could forgive, since the whole season was only 12 episodes. And there was a big problem, and that is Chizuru. In the game her character is not annoying, and it's great. She is somehow believable, as someone who really wants to help the Shinsengumi, she is quite useful, and not totally stupid. While in the anime, she is plain annoying. She can't do anything, always needs to be protected, has an impossibly high voice... I don't know why the creators of the story made her this annoying, but they did wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is full of historical facts, and the fantasy elements are just a great add to it. They have a mythological background, and they fit into the plot, and don't turn illogical. What makes this anime really good, and worth a watch is absolutely it's story.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have the chance to play a game, play it, before watching the anime, but if you don't have the chance, this story is really worth a watch. It is interesting, creative, and has some amazing characters and ideas.",

            "content": "Chizuru's story starts off in quite a common manner ( minus the rounin who are chasing her for reasons unknown ). Her father goes missing and she decides that it's been far too long since she heard from him so armed with a sword and a boy's attire, she sets out. Only to attract the attention of rounin who have nothing better do than chase a \"boy\" who did nothing to them ( I still have no idea why they were chasing her but well, rounin are rounin and we need something to start off with ). \r\nMuch to Chizuru's horror, the rounin are cutdown by demon-like men, their hair gleaming white in the dark of the night. And they're about to cut her down too, when three men suddenly appear and save the day. But no, these men are not your conventional heroes. They are part of the Shinsengumi, a group of \"police officers\" whom the general population share no feelings of camaraderie for, at that time, a rebellion was slowly stirring. \\n\\n\r\nChizuru is handled none-too-gently for witnessing what happened and the Vice-Commander, Hijikata Toushizou is convinced that \"he\" must be killed. The gentle Commander, Kondou Isami is hesitant and we are slowly introduced to the other characters at this point. Okita Souji, Saitou Hajime, Harada Sanosuke, Toudou Heisuke, Nagakura Shinpachi and Sannan Keisuke. Chizuru is saved by the fact that the Shinsengumi too, is searching for her father and they they agree to keep her with them until he is found. \\n\\n\r\nHakuouki is a historical anime and still surprisingly, all the main male characters are models of the real-life people, apart from Sannan-san.  One thing that you'll love about the anime is the male characters. All of them, while fiercely protective of Chizuru, do not display what typical reverse harem boys do. They don't constantly try to grab her attention or sweep her off her feet, only trying to cheer her up and sharing their true feelings with her. If there are any special feelings, the boys give way to the canon couple because there is no time to fight over love when everything they've been fighting for is falling apart. \\n\\n\r\nChizuru, while spending time with the group, discovers quite accidentally exactly why the Shinsengumi are searching for her father and is shocked. A not-so-chance meeting with a mysterious blond who is after her reveals much about herself that even she had no idea about. \\n\\n\r\nMost people describe Chizuru as a spineless character who is of absolutely no use but I think that's exactly what she exists for - to bring out the best of the male characters. It's true that she's mostly unable to fight for herself, having to constantly depend on others but it's not exactly her fault. She has the ability to move on and tries her best to help others. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime managed to capture my attention with the events that were going on. Slowly but surely, the cogs of fate began to turn and started breaking down the protective shield that made the Shinsengumi what it was. Hakuouki is not at all the sparkles and rainbows it appears to be. The events of the anime faithfully follow what happened in real life and then you begin to realise that victory doesn't come as easily as it appears to. \\n\\n\r\nEven so, Hakuouki is intriguing exactly because of that. Enemies and evil are not black and white. It's a blend of colours, never singular and that's exactly what the inevitable war that the Shinsengumi are about to face is. The end of this first season points towards more bloodshed, tragedy and unfortunate events. At this point of time, can they keep holding on?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not one-sided. They have flaws, their own personalities and they make decisions that might not always be the right thing. Their lives, quite refreshingly, do not centre around the female lead and the choices they make might, at times, be surprising. If you're someone like me who has a strong interest in historical events, then Hakuouki is the anime for you. It explores what happened in a truly gripping way. \\n\\n\r\nI fell in love with the OP and ED but the OSTs are quite mediocre. The voice acting, however, was superb and the characters were really expressed well, especially Okita's voice, which I really fell in love with and Chikage, whom Tsuda Kenjirou-san voiced ( I absolutely loved him as Spanner ). \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was one of the strong points, in my opinion, Hakuouki is rightfully not tagged reverse harem but the bishounen quality is still there and the colours are kind of dark-themed, there aren't really any bright colours. \\n\\n\r\nHakuouki, as the first part of the series, did a wonderful job of introducing the characters to us.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not just fans of historical anime, I honestly don't think action fans will be disappointed by this either and if you're a huge fan of romance, then Hakuouki will definitely fulfill your thirst for it. Masochistic people ( like me ) who just can't stop watching tragedies, then, this, surprisingly might just be your cup of tea.",

            "content": "Even if you are not a reverse harem fan nor an otome game player you sholuld take a look at this franchise! I am not a gamer but I looked for the gameplay videos and watched them all. Of course, there are different endings on the game (of course) but both stories, the one told on the anime, and the one told on the movies, lead to one pairing in particular.\r\nThe first thing you should know is that Hakuoki is not just a romance or lovey-dovey story. It goes far beyond love. As we are dealing with the well-known Shinsengumi you will find a lotof fights and blood.\\n\r\nMaybe this \"rasetsu\" twist they give to the story makes it a little bit fanciful but, at very same time, it makes Chizuru's life background somehow interesting. I particularly believe that her character is better developed (and more useful, why not) on the movies rather than on the anime or the game. It is more accentuated on the game for obvious reasons but it is also seen on the anime that Chizuru is an inocent and fragile girl that is just looking for her missing father on a ruthless world full of warriors. On the movies you will find out more about her life, her story, and her personality is much better developed.\\n\r\nNow, from my fan-girl point of view, this is a must if you want to see good-looking, passionate young men fighting for their goals, giving a great importance to their convictions as samurai warriors. The voice acting is superb (and very sexy in some particular cases). They all made a wonderful job on it. I specially liked Showtaro Morikubo (Okita Souji), Kenjirou Tsuda (Kazama) and Tomohiro Tsuboi (Shinpachi Nagakura) voice acting (special mentions to Kousuke Toriumi's Saito and Takayuki Suzuki's Yamazaki), but the whole cast made a brilliant work. If you enjoy their voices as much as I did or really want more of them, please search for the OST!",

            "content": "I really wanted to like this series. Maybe it was my fault for starting the first episode with high expectations. \r\nPros: If you're into ikemen, then this is a fine show for indulging your fancies. In fact, there's a gratuitous episode where the shinsengumi need to get topless for a physical. However, the pros end there. Beyond the beautiful faces, there's not much else. As there are many characters packed into 12 episodes, you never really get to know any of them. \r\nCons: I'm not sure what they were thinking when they thought they could pack all that Japanese history into a dozen episodes. Atany rate, it's not good as a historical anime. It's also no good if you're trying to watch it for romance or drama because there isn't enough of it. Again, way too overarching, packing all the characters and years of history. Character development is also lacking. Even the main protagonist, Chizuru, falls completely flat by the last episode. She actually started the series somewhat interesting, but as the plot unrolled, she regressed more and more until she was just a damsel in distress that cried and became a helpless ornament in the fighting scenes. Sigh.\\n\\n\r\nTake away: Watch this show for the ikemen, and expect nothing more beyond their handsome faces. (Sadly, even their good looks were not enough to entice me into watching Season 2.)",

Although, I still did manage to finish watching it even all the prequels, if you are not aware of the history of Shinsengumi I would recommend you to watch other anime. So, what did make me watch this. I was drawn again by the art and synopsis of it. I was expecting a historical gender bender anime but was disappointed by it. The gender bender thing is just an accessory. I think the art is the one that liftedthe anime. The sound is just so-so. The characters are likable except the heroine my goodness. Given the fact that she is weak okay, fine but if she will carry out the story I think I cannot barely watch it. Her only major part is to narrate the story. Overall, I was surprised that it has sequels. If you are looking for, just a reverse harem, then I recommend you to watch this.",

I like this since it adds spice to the already story line. \r\nThe story is really interesting since it's based upon which I think is true events since it mentions many city names and dates. \r\nThe characters are not really generic harem qualities. All like her, they all protect her, tease her, etc. None get romantic. \r\nI like the artstyle. I love the old anime style. \\n\\n\r\n-Watched DUB version-",

Well compare to other animes with the Shinsengumi guys in too u know. Even Saitou makes me dream about him. Also some great seiyuus like Miki Shinichirou, Morikubou Shotarou, Yusa Kouji, Toriumi Kousuke... OMG !\r\nOf course, the story itself based on Jidaigeki (- real japan history mixed with fantasies). Use Yukimura Chizuru as the protagonist who's involves with Shinsengumi on her journey looking for her missing-father. In which I believe she's never exist on any history of Shinsengumi. Justenjoy it while take a good look for the Shinsen bishounen-tachi ne. Fun for watch really! The scene-battles also good to look at it. Very cool I told u that. if u've seen Peacemaker,well.. i think Hakuouki's a little better more than that coz there's also magic and so on.

The word \"Shinsengumi\" seems like a refined word for battle and it's not because of the fact that this had good looking characters that i watched this anime- i was literally bored. \r\nBut this when compared to the original Hijikata Toshizo and the fictional one in this anime seems to share a lot of attributes. The whole story goes with the original one except for the supernatural elements, And this would be probably educational to a history buff or a Harem lover.\r\nAll starts with a girl who gets thrownunexpectedly into the Shinsengumi, gender bendered in order to find her father. This dedicatedly follows the true history written in Japan except for a few supernatural elements which were used for either Fan service or to make the anime less boring as it was historical. Some of the characters are real whilst i need to do more research: Hajime/Hijikata/Okita/Kondo/Yamazaki/Harada/Heisuke/Shinpachi are recorded in the real events. All other characters to my current knowledge might be fictional. \\n\\n\r\nSo now onto some real Shinsengumi facts:(no spoilers)-Wikipedia\\n\\n\r\n**Hijikata Toshizo died a true warriors death- he was Oni Lieutenant but had human feelings- like he cried in one of the men's funerals who committed Seppuku. He was spoiled and handsome-but later became much matured.\\n\\n\r\nTrue words: \"I am not going to battle to win. With the Tokugawa government about to collapse, it would be a disgrace if no one is willing to go down with it. That is why I must go. I will fight the best battle of my life to die for the country\"\\n\\n\r\n**Hajime Saito- true swords man- Okita Souji feared his skills and he was a teacher at a dojo before coming to Shinsengumi. He was married later on.(sorry fan girls!)\\n\\n\r\n**Heisuke Todo- Illegimate son of Takayuki Todo(rumor)posessed a sword of a higher ranking. Was the 8th Division Captain later on.\\n\\n\r\n**Okita Souji :Was a relative of Kondo? And there was said to be an unusual relationship between Hijikata and him but it was not proved. He was a child prodigy and he did have a sister- two sisters in fact. (Gintama fans!)\\n\\n\r\nStory:Was predictable- this could have been quite boring to a Japanese citizen as he/she probably knows the facts and how it's going to end. But i bet the added story elements and other key supernatural components must make it interesting without doubt. Has some epic plot twists,battle scenes,romance scenes and what's not. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Was eye-candy- I'll admit secretly that i too wanted to be Chizuru at some point and take care of these guys. The clothes/swords/sakura petals/geishas were done and illustrated beautifully as required. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening was superb- totally attractive. There seem to be one unique soundtrack both in the original version and a piano version which added beautifully to the sorrowful scenes which i wept excessively. The Seiyus did a great job- especially Souji and Heisuke oh and Hijikata. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Well these are bad-ass men fighting wars and training in dojos in their spare time. What kind of a treatment would a girl get with these lions? Question was difficult the answer is simple- all of them are amazing personalties. They all had their flaws and pros- but this anime gave a light hearted feeling to the whole situation. The Shinsengumi in here gave out the \"family\" feeling being Hijikata the mother, Kondo as the father and all others children- you can laugh- but's that should be the true feeling of a dedicated team who stakes their lives lol. The only chara which i failed to understand is Kazama- all other characters seemed unique to the plot. The Shinsengumi characters were comprised given the real background they should have been given- and that was very fascinating. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed the anime to my heart's content. I didn't know the stuff was real in this or else i would have watched it more intently. The conflicts-commotions all those little scenes that made you laugh all seems to add up on how would have Shinsengumi lived in reality. Did they lived happily like this- having incoming battles all the time? Or is it the total opposite? \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I gave it an 8 although i was highly intended to give it a 7 at first- but due to the successful attempts in each category- it totally earned it's own score by respecting true events and representing the characters to the fullest level imaginable. This is by far a very interesting anime and i can't give a higher rating than that. \\n\\n\r\nDedicated review to those of the Shinsengumi for their dedication and admirable chivalry towards their country.",

            "content": "HAKUOKI SEASON 1 ANIME REVIEW\r\nWARNING: SPOILER ALERT\r\nOVERALL: 4.2/10\r\nPLOT: 3/10\r\nThe anime focuses on a group which longs to make a name in an edo era. The anime wanted to show how the protagonists struggle to make a name, to help that certain someone to reach the top, to be known since they idolize him and they know his worth. They accept every criticism of the people around them just to reach that goal. However, in my opinion, this is completely bullshit. It is a waste of time. The twenty plus episodes of this anime failed to show the development of the characters. Sorry to say thisbut this really disappointed me. Yes, I love reverse harem series. Much more a historical one. I expected I will also love this anime since the animation is a great one. However, I would also love watching a good one. The protagonist girl is too useless. That is not the same of powerless, by the way. She doesn't show courage or hope or something that a main character should express. I don't really know how come a love blooms on her and the other one. It's like, boom! We're inlove. It feels way too pushy. Yes, there are twists and action scenarios but I don't really know how come there are no impact on it. Maybe because their belief is too unjustifiable? Unreasonable? Or it is just that they did not show their will or belief or principle that they stand for enough for me to also believe them?\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 4/10\\n\r\nThe protagonist girl, as well as most of the characters, are boring. It is like \"Why they are there?\", \"What is your use?\" And the like. Yes, they've acted their role. However, they failed to show the development on it. They never changes. Well, apart from the fact that most of them died. There are other characters who showed strong feelings and strong emotions ot strong beliefs, but the percentage is too small.\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\r\nThe series, I did not like. Same with the characters. But the opening and ending songs is love. \\n\r\nYou can feel the emotions on it. It feels like it dragged you in their era, in their lives where you can clearly feel all the emotions they have. The sadness and struggles and sufferings they've been keeping in their heart. The songs is too powerful for me. Sadly, the series itaelf is not. The voices of the characters is also good. It suits all the characters attitude and behaviour.\\n\r\nENDING: 3/10\\n\r\nEnding is too unrealistic. I did not really expect that a love will bloom. That most of them would die and that they failed to reach that goal of theirs. I am expecting that something would come up in the ending since I've struggle enough just to finished this anime. However, it disappoint me. Bigtime.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 3/10\\n\r\nI did not enjoy it. I did not drop it since I don't intend to drop any anime I've started already, honestly. Every episode is a pain to finish. The episodes is too many that it really took me a while to complete it. I can't think of any episode on which I've felt great or excitement or anything that can boost my likeness on this one.",

            "content": "It's no wonder almost all the reviews start with the fact that Hakuouki is based of an otome game ( generally a game where the main objective is to get pampered by pretty boys with the perspective of one of them falling in love with you). It's this fact that made me ignore this title even though I stumbled upon it so many times.\r\nWhy?\r\nWell, because even though I am a girl, I don't like the fact that this genre obviously thinks the viewer/player is a brainless moron that doesn't notice things being thrown right at them.\r\nWell, did the show meet my expectations?\r\nWell, Yes and No.\r\nOnthe technical side of things Hakuouki surprised me with its attention to detail, motion, fluid animation and effort to make the most out of what the staff had to work with. \\n\r\nIt's not just a still shot with a moving mouth. Not just arms and legs thrown in the air with no relation to clothing and accessories. In this show, when a person moves, the hair wraps around him, the katana at their leg shifts, the clothes shuffle. It's an obvious thing but there's too little anime shows that enjoy this amount of attention : like the subtle movements of the hand when a katana is drawn or when a person in a hakama is standing up. Have you ever put a kinomo on? Walked in zori? It's not as easy to stand up in any of those.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to another beautiful aspect of this show.\\n\r\nMaybe precisely because it was based on a game, the costume designs are really detailed and beautiful. It's not just the same clothes with a colour variation. Every character wears his kimono and hakama in a different manner and this is true for the side characters also. There's probably a thousand ways to tie an obi  and this anime shows it. The amount of detail to living, buildings, everyday household items and other time period details is astonishing and really beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThis is also true of the historical side of the story here, which I believe is also the best part of the story in general. All the events, except probably those involving Chizuru and the..demons..vampires..whatever...are historically relevant if not true. And if this was the main plot it would have been a brilliant historical piece. The anime could have stood together so wonderfully just based on that.\\n\\n\r\nChanges and innovations are a great thing but they do need to have a point.  And that's the case with the \"vampire\" saga here. It serves no purpose! Will the story stay the same if it were gone-yes! Anyone who knows a bit of Japanese history should know where the story is heading. Will the characters and their relationships change- no! It's just a big distraction! And a loss of time that can seriously be made to fill in some very needed character development and historical background.\\n\r\nSince it's a Japanese show and the characters are real people, the names, places and details are being thrown right at you. And by the end of season one it's kind of hard to follow the historical events already. I think a serious amount of wasted time can be used to develop the relationships between the fighting factions. Get some insight on their motifs for example. It doesn't matter if you've read it in history books, it's just how it looks when you put the show together. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show, of course are all pretty and a huge eye candy. And if the anime didn't have a lot of other good points, I'd probably leave it at that. However in a show that has something to offer, bad points tend to stand out even more. I wouldn't say the characters are not enjoyable or they don't have their personalities developed. They do. But in a very sort of clich\u00e9d, stereotyped way. They are obviously there because they need to attract different target groups. You can tell immediately that his is the fun guy and that's the serious guy and oh, we have a guy for every taste here (just in case, you know..) and you all know how they're going to act...yuppie...and they all have to pamper you..oh, I mean the main character that you're totally not supposed to identify with.....BORING! And that's the thing I really hate about this kind of show. YES! We do like the eye candy, but it doesn't have to hit us on the head like a cannon ball for us to notice!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you don't mind the bishies thrown at you at every corner, it's an enjoyable show with some really great detail, animation, some really nicely choreographed and directed fighting scenes and a strong historical background that make it exciting to watch. The score isn't bad and fits nicely though I wish it had more of a classical Japanese tone to it. Because everything in the show is so tied to the time period, this is the only thing missing to really make it feel like you're thrown right in the middle of things.\\n\\n",

I must say that she's the most pathetic, helpless, useless character i've ever seen in all my years of watching anime... she startedof as cute - dressed up in 'kenshin-style' clothes... but as the story progressed, she didn't... yeah, she's an oni looking for her father... an oni with no personality... aarrgghh!! she is so frustrating to watch since all she does is scream everybody-san's names and cry and giggle and blush... c'mon!!\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the Shinsengumi... Hijikata, Okita, Kondo, Sano, Shinpachi, Heisuke and Saito... did I miss anyone? well, i don't care... i've had my share of the Shinsengumi - from Rurouni Kenshin to my favorite series Gintama... but I must say that this is the most pitiful way of depicting these guys... yeah, they're strong, tough and loyal men... but to mix them up with vampire-like creatures? makes me think that the one who created this anime still has some vampire hang-ups... and spoiler alert: you didn't need to kill of Yamazaki!! damn!\\n\\n\r\nVillains were okay, i guess... 3 typical evil guys: 1 strongman (Amagiri), 1 gunman (Shiranui) and 1 oni leader (Kazama)... they don't have much screentime and i'm not really in a mood to write about them...\\n\\n\r\nThere were only 2 good scenes in that 12 episodes, for me... and these would be (spoiler alert), when Okita and Hijikata became Rasetsu's... nice fight scenes...\\n\\n\r\nI still have 10 more episodes after this one... here's hoping that Edo would make a difference... but i'm not really counting on it...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The original design was by Kazuki Yone, her art style is just beautiful by the way.\r\nWell anyways Hakuoki combines the few things i love about anime: supernatural, olden Japan and hotbishounen with fascinating characters.\\n\r\nThe first episode was awesome, with zombie people and the bloodshed which was just to my liking- not too much, not too little.\\n\\n\r\nBut then again this is a harem anime, so yes i will be expecting the usual package.

            "content": "(SPOILERS!!!!)      So first of all, this is my first time doing a review, but I was seeing all the hate from other reviewers and I highly recommend this anime!  Anyways, I'm not going to lie, the reason I started watching it was because, I mean, look at them. They are extremely fucking hot as shit. But, as I began the show, the characters actually started to have their own unique characteristics (even if they were pretty typical archetypes of otome games). The art is just astounding and has a very relaxing feel (ignore the cover art). The music isjust amazing, and I'm actually listening to OSTs from this show right now. Other people have been complaining that there is no story or character development, but I beg to differ. It is about a girl (who is by the way one of the most useless main characters I've ever seen, second only to Yui from Diabolik Lovers (0-0)) who gets saved and taken in by this troupe of hot samurai guys while looking for her dad when he magically disappeared a while ago. They originally mistake her for a guy at the beginning which caused a case of the LOLs for me. They take her in with them, an army of hundreds of people (all guys btw ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) ) and 6 captains, who are all drool-worthy. So, what Chizuru (main character) finds out is that this fuckass dude in the group of guys is experimenting some random fucking drug on the soldiers that turns them into what I can only describe as having the ability of Shingeki no Kjojin titan shifters mixed with the bloodlust and strength of Tokyo Ghoul ghouls (in other words, they're dumbass OP vampires that die if they use their power a lot) Some character development later, this random ass demon dude (who also makes ovaries explode) is like, \"Hmm, that's a nice main character you got there.... Ima just gonna take this and be on my way,\" but all of the captains are like, \"fuck no, bitch get out the way,\" so they end up fucking eachother up multiple times and shit. Also, there's this huge ass fucking war that's still going on (this anime is actually based off of real historic events, the Shinsengumi, which is the group of dudes, were a real thing). So by this point I've already picked out my baes for this show which are, Sanosuke, Saito, and Shiranui. So Chizuru (main character) and Hijikata (main dude) are basically acting like fucking 3rd graders (mostly Hijikata) and are like, \"ew, gross cooties\" and it causes a lot of facepalm. Also Chizuru is being a fucking derp the whole entire time, but, I mean, otome main character syndrome. So this season ends with some fucking feels. (MAJOR SPOILERS FOR THE SECOND SEASON!!!) Onto the second season, because I'm too lazy to open a new page :^\\. So, they basically ate shit during the war, and lost. Now, all of these fucking amazing fights take place now. Shinpachi (another captain) decides to be a little bitch and leave the Shinsengumi to go emofag (-_-)\\n\r\nidek. Some more plot and character development takes place. There's some more fights and Kazama (random ass demon guy from before) is still trying to suprise adopt Chizuru from the Shinsengumi so he can basically marry her and have demon babies with her? wtf. I don't remember when this got revealed, but again if you didn't read earlier MAJOR SPOILERS FOR SECOND SEASON. So apparently Chizuru is a fucking demon too, and yeah. So the Shinsengumi are like, idgaf, you still can't have her. All of the sudden (I actually think it got revealed in season 1, but whatever) Souji (a captain who is amazing af) has tuberculosis. And now he's dying... (\u0ca0_\u0ca0) Also, the leader of the Shinsengumi died because he got caught. So it's the last few episodes of the season and here's where all of the characters are at. Saito: He's off to be the captain of the Shinsengumi on the war front. Souji: Dying of tuberculosis. Heisuke (other captain): Took the fucking demon drug, so now he's fucked. Hijikata: Finally kissed Chizuru, and most like did the mattress mambo with her later (\u0ca0\u203f\u21bc). Shinpachi: I don't even remember if he even came back or not... Sanosuke: Fighting against one of Kazama's homies (Shiranui and other OP dude).  So all of the sudden, the people who created this anime decided to ass rape all of the viewers right in the feels without lube. So Souji took the drug and turned into a demon thingy, because yolo I guess. And guess what, Chizuru's missing dad is a fucking evil piece of fuck. He's been making this demon drug better. (the original people who took the drug were like vampires and couldn't be in the sunlight, because one of the writers probably spent his free time writing Twilight fanfics on deviantart or wattpad) So meanwhile while this dude just fucking left his teen daughter alone to fend for herself, not to mention Chizuru is not the sharpest crayon in the box, while he makes this drug even stronger. Basically, the people who took the original drug all on steroids. So now they can walk in the sunlight, and they are harder to kill than Sephiroth from Kingdom Hearts. Meanwhile, Souji is out guarding the Shinsengumi base when lo and behold, this random army of guys planning to assasinate Hijikata appears. Souji is having a bitchfit because he couldn't go and help the other captains in the war. So he decides that since he has tuberculosis and is going to get closer to dying every time he uses his demon power, that he should kill this entire army. And he does. And here is the first feels rape, because he dies. \"You have killed an enemy\" . So I don't even remember what Heisuke was doing, but Chizuru is in danger, so he fucking saves her. But guess what? He took the drug, so now he used up all of his energy and dies. \"Double kill.\" This is just the beginning. Sanosuke was out fighting Shiranui, when all of the sudden the army of Chizuru's dad's demon people on roids suprise appears. Her dad gives this long ass speech that doesn't even matter. And then they start attacking Sanosuke and Shiranui. So they team up. Guess what? They both die. \"Triple kill.\" So now there's Saito, who's leading his army against this huge force that overpowers them by a shit ton of people. So he gives this sad ass speech and such, rushes into battle with all of his men, AND DIES. \"Quadra kill.\" So now we have Hijikata. Hijikata ends up meeting Kazama. So they decide to fight to finally decide who gets Chizuru. Hijikata is overpowered by Kazama, because he's a fucking demon. So you know what he does? HE TAKES THE DRUG.(\u256f\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0)\u256f\ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253b So he ends up killing Kazama, only after he explains his sad back story of course. So now, since he took the drug that KILLS YOU, he gives this sad speech that literally crushes any feels that have not been killed by all of the other deaths. And then dies in Chizuru's lap while seeing the faded out captains of the Shinsengumi in the sky, and then joins them. \"Pentakill. Enemy team has scored an Ace.\" So now that you have no feels left, you are left an empty shell of sadness. Basically the ending is, everybody gets boned, including you. The End.",

            "content": "As an Otome based viewer, I can say Hakuouki is one of the best Otome games adapted anime. I played the games countless time, re-watched the anime from season 1 till the movies countless times and this series never cease to stab my heart with all the feels and deaths of the story. Many of you would disagree with me since we are different kind of audience, Hakuouki also highlighted on the historical moments in Japan although the story plot maybe fictitious, but the events took place in the series did exists. Don't believe me? Google it up. Each character hasa unique personality and how they would interact with the main girl, Chizuru is also amusing to watch.  Comparing Chizuru with other otome heroines like Nanami Haruka from Uta no Prince-sama, Chizuru has a wonderful personality trait. Chizuru maybe a bit useless in the anime, however she is not as useless as you think she is in the games. Before you want to negatively talk about hakuouki, please stop and think have you played the games and compared it to the anime? Because, original works are better than the adaptions.",

Otherwise non-game audience will not be attracted to this, and also find it difficult to understand without the necessary background information.\r\nHonestly, I would still have given it an overall 8 had it not been for the annoying heroine. Yukimura Chizuru is one of the most useless female protagonists I have seen to date. Why such a strong character like Hijikata Toshizouwould go for her... Oh well. In the realm of anime anything is possible.\\n\\n\r\nGreat visuals, great costumes and style. Fight sequences could have been much better, given the ronin backdrop of feudal Japan. But overall, other than the token useless heroine, this wasn a passable anime to watch.",

Everything was done halfway from the fights to the barely there romance. I could't find any likable character because in the end they were all one-dimensional. Also the story is based around a girl looking for her father. This main characteris basically a filler character. She does nothing significant at all and is so clueless. What a disappointment.",

I love the storyline... There are happy and sad moments, but truly, I pity Shinsengumi and its fate...\r\nAbout Chizuru, I don't really despise her (she is a weak character and hated by many MAL users...hihi!) From my perspective, Chizuru did her best to help Shinsengumi and stayed with them through ups and downs until the end although thereis not much that she could do...\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very nice... I love the characters especially Hijikata-san! \ud83d\ude19\ud83d\ude19The OP & ED are good... The seiyuus also are good...

There are a few plot points that have been brought up but none of them come to anything in Season 1. However as it is, Its a good Samurai anime with a cool them and ideas, and at 12 episodes its worth a watch. If you got the time give it a watch, as for me, Ill wait for Season 2 to finish telling me what the heck is going on with these people.",

            "content": "About Hakuouki:\r\n    For the story I gave it an 8/10:\r\n           The story focuses on Chizuru Yukimura a pure-blooded oni who went to Kyoto to look for her 'Father'. Then after a very traumatic event she met the Shinsengumi. Afterwards stuff happens and she became their servant.\r\n           This show is based on an otome game called 'Hakuouki: Demon of the Fleeting Blossom' wherein the character gets to choose who will be herlove interest. Bad guy or good guy it doesn't matter.\\n\\n\r\n           The anime focused on Toshizo Hijikata's Path. Which was considered the longest in the game and the most dramatic one since SPOILER!!! one-by-one the Shinsengumi members die. \\n\\n\r\n           So why give it an 8 out of 10? Okay so here's the catch first, Chizuru doesn't actually do any combat in the series. She knows how to defend herself and can actually be quite tough but the problem is that most of the time she relies on the protection of the boys. That's the thing you'll find really annoying in the series.\\n\\n\r\n          Second, she's actually an amnesiac that doesn't give a damn at her past. So yeah she met her brother during one of the episodes in season 2. Her reaction? I have no idea who that dude is. Kaouru then explains all the things that happened before she even met her 'father'. That's right their past. After all the explaining that happened you know what she's like? I still don't give a damn. It's kind of frustrating actually. The series should've at least explained why she doesn't remember anything. \\n\\n\r\n         Third, there's action alright but well hey! After finding out Chizuru's an oni I expected she'd show more awesome abilities she possesed aside from quick regeneration but NO she just remained being... her.\\n\\n\r\n         Fourth, almost everyone had died. Except for Saitou although it is not mentioned if he lived. By the ending, the images of all shinsengumi members appeared including Saitou's so it was assumed he died as well :((. \\n\\n\r\n        In sum, the story's good but expect a weak female protagonist and drama because of the death of your favorite characters...\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\n       The art was well drawn. Good color combination too, not flashy nor too dull. The costumes were based on historical dresses so it fits the story. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\n       To me the op for season 1 seems a bit boring to me but somehow calming. The op for season 2 is quite catchy. The OST's were wonderful! \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\\n\r\n       The boys have a lot of characteristics and traits that were very interesting. You have a serious one, a sadistic one, a responsible one, an arrogant one, loyal one, playboy-like one, tough guy one.\\n\\n\r\n       Chizuru's traits seemed fine to me but if she had really polished her swordmanship skills and combined with her oni powers she'd be an awesome cross-dressing samurai. She's also dense and too naive.   \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\\n\r\n        I wished they made different seasons where they featured another Path. There are cheesy moments although I doubt some of you may consider them cheesy :PP.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\n       I enjoyed watching the series although it wasn't what I expected. I still loved it. So yeah I recommend this anime to people who likes Oni, Bishounen, and Action. It's mark to me is PASSED :DDD",

            "content": "^.^ \r\nStory: 10\r\nBasically a young girl named Chizuru has dressed herself as a boy and is on a journey to find her father. She is then taken into custody by the Shinsengumi, with their leader Hijikata left responsible for her. She has to continue dressing like a boy, but she accompanies them with their many ventures. \r\n~Ok so most otome game animes in my opinion do not do that well, but this one is exceptional. Since I'm a sucker for reverse harems, I gave this a try. The plot and story has real depth and shows the characters struggles. But what I like most aboutthis anime is the fact that it really has it all. Though not very light-hearted, it has tons of action, fantasy and of course, some shoujo romance. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nOk so the art is exceptional. By far, one of the best. \\n\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nI personally loved the opening and ending song. The voices of the characters were right on as well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nChizuru: So a lot of people bash the female protagonist Chizuru, for her helplessness and the fact that she doesn't do anything. But she was not meant to help fight or anything. She was just looking for her dad and ran into the Shinsengumi..and she did the best she could to contribute in some way. I enjoyed her throughout the show but I feel like they could have given her a more interesting personality. At times, she seemed very cliche to me. And though she is the only female and the main character, the show is really about the guys. The guys were great. Each one had their own personal battle and it was interesting to watch because everyone had their own personality. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nIf you like tons of action you will enjoy this. But if you like shoujo romances, I feel you will really enjoy it as well but don't expect the series to be completely focused on the romance and relationships. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 ^^\\n\\n",

Anyways this anime was okay for the most part, I did find myself disappointed but it;s my fault for having the expectations I had. If you're looking to watch this anime for the romance then prepare to be disappointed because there is zero development as far as romance goes.\r\nThe summary of the story and the actual anime in my opinion did not match at all. A group of boys are looking for a doctor and happen to find his daughter and yet all they ever do is patrol the cityand get random updates about whatever.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters for me were not what I expected. Obviously a story like this, you know who is the love interest to who, too bad, however, you don't see much bonding forming. There is maybe about two to three very light blushes on Chizuru's part and all Toshi and the boys ever remind her of is hat they will kill her for whatever reason.\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing that peeved me was the fact Chizuru was given a sword but apparently it's just for show as she never uses it and one and only time she actually pulls it out, she doesn't fight because the boys come just in time before she possibly loses anyways.\\n\\n\r\nBut all in all I'd give it a six in the overall and enjoyment department.",

            "content": "Is it just me, or does the entire English cast of CLANNAD fit into the English cast of Hakuouki?\r\nI believe this is a real gem amongst anime. Admittedly, it had its moments, which is to be expected in otomate-to-anime adaptions (GAH CHIZURU PICK UP YOUR KATANA YES RIGHT THERE ON YOUR BELT THAT'S RIGHT NO TIME'S RUNNING OUT QUICK CHIZURU OH TOO LATE IT'S BISHIE SAMURAI NO.#7'S TURN TO RESCUE YOU AHHH).\r\nMaybe that was a bit harsh. Truth be told, this anime is really well done. I didn't realise at the time that the members of the Shinsengumi (kind of the Japanese secret police ofthe 1800s) in the anime were actually based on the real-life members of the Shinsengumi in Japanese history.\\n\\n\r\n~\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\nThe storyline wasn't too bad, although it did have a few less-realistic moments when it came to the hybrid plotline.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe art was AMAZING. Really gorgeous. The animation too was really great - it flowed nicely, and there were never any bumpy moments.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nI love this soundtrack. Both the OP and ED songs were fabulous (and really catchy, grr). The OST was lush.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nI really love the characters in this - yes, even the Heroine. Whilst she did have her cringy moments, she also had her admirable ones where she stands up for herself and her new friends. As for the rest of the characters, they were hilarious. There's never a dull moment in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI enjoyed it. There were a few gory moments that made me cringe (I don't like that stuff...) but I was easily whipped up in the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nIf you like historical anime with a samurai/mutant twist and a small tad of shoujo-style romance, then this anime is for you (The small romantic aspect gets elaborated on more in the second season.)",

            "content": "Before anyone pushes onward with this review, be aware that I've got little to no knowledge of the video game source material that Hakuoki is based on. So don't fret if I can't connect the dots on anything or messed up on stating something that came from the game as I'm judging this series only on its own merits. With that said, on with the review.\r\nHakuoki appears to make a dramatized spin on things involving the Shinsengumi as notable members of the famous group of swordsmen from the final years of Japan's shogunate period aid a young woman named Chizuru in seeking the whereabouts ofher father. The plot for this series is an engaging one as the Shinsengumi learn of some shady government dealings that Chizuru's father had, dealing with resistance factions trying to crush the shogunate and learning a shocking revelation on Chizuru that leads a supernatural element to the challenges faced by the group. These developments lead members of the faction to make difficult and life-threatening decisions to ensure Chizuru's protection and the soldiers to maintain their pride as swordsmen when dealing with the complicated events that befall them. And the life threatening element is a literal case as several major members of the Shinsengumi are killed in battle through the ordeals they face from the slow and inevitable fall of the Tokugawa shogunate. At the same time, the series is left open-ended as there are still some unanswered questions regarding the supernatural elements revealed in Hakuoki and the fate of the Shinsengumi in the title's finale for its next season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization in this series is a mixed bag. Hakuoki retains the major historical members of the Shinsengumi as Chizuru interacts with them throughout her adventures with the group, though their personalities are fictionalized to a degree to make them accessible to the audience by making them relatable characters instead of the idealized takes that you would see from live-action chanbara films. This approach may be a love it or hate it deal depending on the level of depth you want from your characters as there is enough depth on characters to give them a defining personality and a few traits that stick out, but nothing too complicated. Also for a female lead, I found Chizuru to be rather bland and mostly worthless as a character. While she doesn't have an obnoxious personality, she has no defining traits that allow her to be identifiable as a unique character compared to the swordsmen that make up the Shinsengumi nor allow her to be effective in supporting the faction in anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Hakuoki is also a bit of a mixed bag. While scenery and character designs are pleasing on the eyes with vivid color and a great level of detail, the series resorts to a number of animation shortcuts during heated or crowded scenes with anything like speed stripes, pan shots and still frames. If you are going into this series expecting fluid sword action, you will be disappointed here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hakuoki's plot is the driving force that presently has me engaged with its mix of supernatural elements and historical elements involving the inevitable fall of the Shinsengumi and the shogunate period. Despite its shortcomings, I plan to press on with Hakuoki's second season at some point.",

Okay, no, there's only one thing I'm angry at.\r\nSTORY: 6. 12 episodes, and most of them are dialogues. Yes, I understand they want to set a storyline, but at times it confused me -- who's who? Another betrayal? Wait, weren't you supposed to be somewhere else!? As I type this, I'm halfway through the second series, which is another review altogether.\r\nI digress, though. I watched this show thinking 'oh! This would be a brilliant anime on a lazy Sunday'. No, not really. But hey,I kept watching, didn't I?\\n\\n\r\nART: 9. The art is absolutely breathtaking. The countryside, the little details in the houses, etc.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 5. Not too big with the sound. Perhaps it's just me.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8. NOT SO FAST! I am saving this 8 for characters that do deserve it. Who are they, you ask? Anyone that IS NOT Chizuru, the protagonist.\\n\r\nAhaha, so my rant begins:\\n\\n\r\nSO! Chizuru Yukimura. Where do I even begin. She's the most one-dimensional character ever. Helpless, crybaby, and her expressions only consists of: :(, or :|. I am not even kidding. SO infuriating! You have great power within you, and you decide to scream out people's names in hopes of them not attacking you, and the boys will come and rescue you in a heartbeat? Jeez, man. I'll put you in the same group as Orihime Inoue of Bleach, and that girl from Vampire Knight (for the love of anime, I cannot remember her name.) I feel like STRANGLING her if I could. She wields a sword, and 95% of the time she hardly sheathes it and puts her hand there probably deciding whether she wants to take it out or have McDonald's later on. When the enemy's sword is RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER FACE, she screams, one of the boys rescue her, she says their name and cries some more, the end.\\n\\n\r\n!?!?!?! WHY. You have a freakin' weapon. USE IT. No, more importantly, USE YOUR BRAIN. -frustrated sigh- There were so many times I wished to scream at my screen, but alas, it falls on deaf ears. Sigh.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 6. See: Characters. You will know why by now.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7. Lovely anime, lovely art, insufferable protagonist but the other characters are fine. Am I biased, you say? Probably.

So although the story was good, and kept me really entertained, Chizuru could've been a bit more heroic. Not only just that but the final ending of the second season ending leftme completely unsatisfied and in tears, in tears because I did love this anime... but unsatisfied for a good reason.

It was a tragedy what happened at the end of the anime, I was extremely sad watching the ending!\r\nI would highly recommend this anime if your into historical anime with superb looking characters andemotionally ending, and bits and pieces of tragedies here and there.",

I can't stand a useless female lead who needs protecting by the men all the time.  Especially if she's trying to pass as a man.\r\nAnyway, lots of pretty boys, interesting fight scenes, but it could have been so much more if they'd followed through with more plot and character development on the lead.",

The story is incredible, and the character are believable and inspire empathy and sympathy from the viewer. On the whole, it is a masterpiece of pure genius!\r\nThat being said, Hakuouki, like all great anime, is not without its faults; the most glaring one being the complete and utter helplessness of the main female lead, Chizuru. \r\nDespite the fact that she carries a sword with her, and claims to have some knowledge and skill in its use, she has never once been proven capable of defendingherself.  She is always being protected by the men of the story and, while her helplessness may seem endearing to some, it merely serves to annoy me.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, because the anime is based off of a video game, there are certain gaps in the plot at times. Nothing big enough to seriously confuse the viewer, but enough that one may get the impression that they are missing something.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, these minor flaws pale in comparison to the sheer awesomeness that is this anime. It is both heart breakingly sweet and tragic, as well as being funny and happy.  I recommend it whole heartedly!",

            "content": "A poor adaption of one of the most well written visual novel's out there. \r\nWatching this before I played the VN, I did feel it was \"alright\" if not a little frustrating a times. But even back then I could see charm and decent plot shining back through, so I got the game and found out myself. Even the old first version of the game that was released on psp (and has been vastly improved upon in a PC version released more recently) was leagues better than this pathetic excuse. \r\nChizuru as a character does lack a lot personality (she's not quite a card boardcut out like many VN protags, and I'd say her passive personality is more reflective of the attitude of women at the time) but thats kind of the point. In game, you made up for that with your own feelings and choices. However, the anime really should have taken more time to expand upon her, and give her more of a personality. The game can get away with a bland personality, but the anime cannot because it lacks the player autonomy the game has. \\n\r\nArguably however, the anime did expand on her personality and even added some! Specifically the traits of; weak, dependant, sulky, selfish and generally around being unlikeable! Hooray!\\n\\n\r\nThe route the anime appears to take is the Hijikata route, yet it does it in ways that purposefully damages other routes (making the MC look annoying, stupid, and useless at best). Admittedly the game's first version shares this problem, but it wasn't so much a story thing as it was a mechanic thing, simply an option there if you didn't want to raise the other character's affections (the new game fixes this, by pretty much giving you chance every time to raise your desired characters affection without really lowering others, so its much more bearable).\\n\\n\r\nThe only things I can really compliment the anime on is the art and historical accuracy; though even then these are both things the game did BETTER. The only thing good to come out of this adaption is the possibility of interesting people enough for them to look up and play the game its based on.\\n\\n\r\nI know I'm comparing this anime to the game a lot, but as a wise man named Dom once said, \"If you want the huge boost in audience interest you get by taking on the name of a popular piece of work you have to accept that you will be compared to that piece of work\".",
