Just before the Gold Tribe left to travel to another Universe, a fourth race appeared, traveling to the stars on their own accomplishments. The Golds named the human race the Iron Tribe. During the passing of time, humanity suffers at the hands of the more dominant races and is now facing extinction.

She meets a wild haired boy on an abandoned planet\u2014a fateful encounter that will not only change the fortunes of Humanity, but also the fate of the universe. (Source: AniDB)",
