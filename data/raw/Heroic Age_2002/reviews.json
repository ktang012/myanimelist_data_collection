            "content": "Every genre has certain themes that are considered its staples - the building blocks of stories that have been, or are yet to be told. One of the most common elements in science fiction is the Earth being attacked by an alien force with superior technology, and there are numerous stories about this topic in everything from radio plays to comic books (with a few Hollywood blockbusters thrown in for good measure). These tales are usually resolved by the use of human ingenuity and courage, together with a healthy dose of serendipity (the battleship just happened to be there).\r\nBut what happens when the enemy reallyis unbeatable?\\n\\n\r\nHeroic Age is set in a future where Earth has been conquered by two alien races that are hell-bent on the total annihilation of the ones they call the \"Iron Tribe\". Over a century has passed and humanity continues to live in hiding across the universe, hoping and praying that the saviour promised by the all-powerful Golden Tribe would appear. After a short introduction concerning the major tribes in the series, the story begins with the spectral image of Princess Dianeira Y Laisha Arturia Ol Yunos floating in space as she attempts to locate the traces of a ship that has been lost for over 120 years. Together with the crew of the Argonaut she has journeyed through uncharted areas of the cosmos, and after four long years of searching it seems as though their quest may end on a half-destroyed planet that appears to be cut off from the rest of space.\\n\\n\r\nThat world is Olone, and upon it lives a young man called Age (and his tentacled friend Food).\\n\\n\r\nScience fiction tends to be a pretty common genre in anime, but only a few shows can truly call themselves space operas - and even amongst those Heroic Age is more than a little unusual. Much of the plot has been inspired by greek mythology - in particular the legends surrounding Hercules - and this is very clearly reflected in not just the nomenclature or the tasks given to the Nodos, but also in the language used throughout the series. The narrative adopts a measured, formal tone which may not sit well with viewers who want a frenetic pace and minute-to-minute excitement - even though this approach is fitting because of the heavy classical influencel.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, Heroic Age does contain a lot of combat and tension, but instead of the usual gung-ho attitude of other space-based anime (certain parts of the Macross and Gundam franchises for example), there's a tangible sense of desperation within the series. This stems from the fact that humanity is very clearly outnumbered, outgunned, and vastly inferior in terms of technology - factors which place far more emphasis on the need for a miracle, and like all such things the Nodos are both a blessing and a curse.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of design the characters are something of a mixed bag. The clothing for the humans is generally in keeping with the plot (utilitarian outfits for the most part), but their features are often unremarkable. As for the aliens, aside from the insectoid Bronze tribe and Food's species on Olone, everyone seems to be humanoid. It would have been nice if a little more imagination had been applied to the other inhabitants of the universe - variety is the spice of life after all. That said, the Nodos are interesting as they look more like an armoured creation of Doctor Moreau - which gives them a degree of familiarity, but also makes them appear far more monstrous than every other alien species.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter animation is surprisingly consistent throughout the series, and while the usage of CG is generally good (the transformation sequences or the pitched space battles for example), there are several moments that are decidedly clumsy in both execution and integration. Thankfully these are relatively minor issues that don't really have any impact on proceedings, and the show features some great audio-visual effects and choreography (although the mechanical servo noise used for Belcross has caused some confusion about the Nodos).\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that people will remember about Heroic Age is the exceptional music. The score is filled with tracks that appeal to any number of human emotions, and in all honesty the entire soundtrack (especially the main theme), seems to have two main purposes - add to the atmosphere of the story and make the viewer feel just a little bit epic.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening sequence is a decent compilation of the main characters and a few action scenes, combined with Gravitation by Japanese pop band Angela - and thankfully there's almost nothing that could be counted as a spoiler. Each episode ends with Azurite - a melancholy ballad sung by Urakabe Tae - and the accompanying imagery shows Dianeira walking along the shore alone and then floating in space above a planet. Now this may seem like a fairly typical anime closing sequence, but it's actually a rather clever bit of foreshadowing that fits very well once the viewer understands the context.\\n\\n\r\nPossibly the biggest issue with Heroic Age is the dialogue - in particular because of the formality inherent in the series. The Japanese script is rather cumbersome in its use of language and is filled with repetitions of words and phrases  - sometimes just in one scene. Thankfully this approach fits the tone of the anime and the experienced voice cast have managed to overcome this hurdle to deliver some good performances. Unfortunately the English dub is even more convoluted, and things only get worse with the use of incorrect nomenclature (Dianela should actually be Dianeira - after the wife of Hercules, Age is pronounced Eiji, and so on). It's clear that the rewriters have tried too hard to turn the series into an animated saga poem, and many of the voice actors audibly struggle with their lines during certain monologues and declamations.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, if the viewer is able to move past these issues then they're likely to find some rather interesting characters.\\n\\n\r\nHeroic Age is filled with lots of people who have their own beliefs and circumstances, but it's the numerous questions that surround the Nodos, the tasks assigned to them, and their purpose in the universe that lead to evolution of several major supporting roles on both sides of the war. In addition to this the series clearly highlights the dual nature of humanity as both protectors and destroyers - which is something of a rarity in the genre - and the repercussions of these acts have a lasting effect on storyline.\\n\\n\r\nDianeira isn't the typical vapid lead female, but she is a bit too kind, trusting and forgiving for her own good - especially where her brothers are concerned. She also displays a great deal of courage on a variety of occasions, not the least of which is her decision to lead the crew of the Argonaut across uncharted space while the two most powerful tribes in the universe try to kill them. Her character is particularly unusual because of the dichotomy of her role - she is both protected by the crew of the Argonaut, but also acts as their guide and protector across space.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand Age is something of a conundrum - which is why there are a few misconceptions about him. He is a teenager who has been young for a very long time (over 120 years), and has an innocent mind but possesses knowledge of the future. He can be charming and endearing at times, but also terrifying in his rage - and his straightforward mentality hides a surprisingly deep character. His childhood with beings who are effectively gods and his years sharing his body with Belcross - a surviving member of the legendary Heroic Tribe - have effectively isolated him from the race  that he is fated to protect, but his carefree attitude and sunny disposition add some much-needed comic relief to the story. More than anything, he is a departure from the usual heroes found in anime as he is not driven by courage or the desire to protect his friends, but by faith in the future that he has been shown.\\n\\n\r\nHeroic Age has a lot in common with shows like Battlestar Galactica (the new version), Ulysses 31, Guin Saga, and surprisingly - Shingeki no Kyojin, and fans of those titles may find themselves on familiar ground with the storyline.  The layers of subtext about the nature of man and humanity's place in the universe fit very well with the narrative and themes of the show, and the series contains a lot more symbolism than one might expect (the similarity between Dianeira's astral projections and the figureheads found on sailing ships, the five tribes being named after Hesiod's Ages of Man, the number of labours assigned to each Nodos, and more).\\n\\n\r\nThe decision to adopt a cerebral approach to a very common theme in science fiction and to follow classical themes and influences has created a space opera that - although formal - adds a dose of intelligence and thoughtfulness to the action and tension. The show may not be for everybody, but those who do give it a chance will understand why the name \"Heroic Age\" is so appropriate.",

            "content": "Heroic Age is a Space, Sci-fi, Action, Adventure with a story basically about mankind's struggle to exist in the galaxy and to carry out instructions laid out by the Golden Tribe. The basic premise of the story itself is great but not original, but at least it's made easy to understand with the superb intros in the first couple of episode. There happen to be some similarities in this anime's plot and Star Wars IV and some other sci-fi anime; Vandread and Gundam Seed. So this is an anime Star Wars fans can enjoy however don't expect to see any lightsaber duels.\r\nThe battles in thisanime are pretty spectacular, which is basically composed of thousands of mechs, space fighters and aliens, plus throw in a Nodos or two. These are animated very well which mixes drawn animation and 3DCG and is to the point, where something as insignificant as Age transforming into the Bellcross becomes a spectacle however there will always remain some who won't like the CG. The space battles between huge fleets are amazing but they later lose their affect, when some scenes are later reused. Also when a single Nodos has the power to easily wipe out a planet from the face of the galaxy, it makes all the huge superbly animated space battles seem like such a waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is fantastic to listen to with a superb orchestra score that's especially good when it comes to the battles but it lacks variety. The opening theme is also really great and stands out from others I've heard.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime series had a great deal of potential as the story began to develop however there's a turning point, which stopped the series from living up to its expectation. Apart from the several noticeable flaws, like the characters' personalities, reused battle scenes and illogical story, this was a pretty enjoyable sci-fi series. So don't let the negative reviews stop you from watching this however for those who aren't fans of Space anime should steer clear from this one.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

And the pace does improve as the anime goes on.\r\nThe story I think is a very enjoyable one. It is very original, having several unique qualities.\r\nIt fallows the 'classic' way of doing things. Introduces characters, establishes personalities and let's you get to know the characters, then puts the story into full force.\r\nan 8 on story from me.\r\nArt:\r\nFor me, the art was very strange at first. Having an unfamiliar look, at least out of the thingsI'd seen before I'd never seen an art quite like it.  \\n\r\nThe characters are very thin and tall, and the eyes have something about the pupils which I fine interesting. In the beginning I didn't like the art, but I grew to love it as I watched the show and as an artist I now find it very fun to draw.\\n\r\nA 10 on art from me.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music:\\n\r\nThe sound effects were normal. Nothing wrong there. They did what they should do, added to the experience as a whole. I do remember liking how they used the sound effects for the Nodos.\\n\r\nThe music was nothing special. I can't even remember the opening or ending song. Though that means I didn't dislike it either I suppose.\\n\r\nTaking both into account I'll give sound/music a 7.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nLike most shows there were characters I liked and didn't like. But there were far more I liked then did not. So that's  plus. ^^\\n\r\nThe characters are all interesting in their own ways and the show has several memorable characters in my opinion.\\n\r\nAs I said earlier character development was handled well I thought.\\n\r\nGiving you just enough to fall for the characters without spending ages building up pasts. Very well done. A 10 on character from me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nPersonally I enjoyed this anime quite a lot. But I didn't at first. This show has to grow on people I think. It has a very odd feel to it so I don't think it's for just everyone. You will probably want to already have a liking for mech shows.\\n\r\nThough the show has several things about it which could make it appeal even to those uninterested in mech shows previously. I think it has a great potential to be loved by anyone willing to take the time get into it.\\n\r\nA 9 on enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI'll give it a 9 overall.\\n\r\nVery good. Not perfect, but closer then most shows come. ^_^\\n\r\nI highly recommend it.",

            "content": "So, take one part Neon Genesis Evangelion, one part Mobile Suit Gundam and one part of extremely boring political intrigue, mix thoroughly and boil for 26 episodes, and you will receive a product that equals Heroic Age.  Even though the first few episodes held so much promise for this anime series, the repetition of battles and the boring political talk between plain looking characters is what takes the heroic out of the anime, Heroic Age.\r\nThe story is your pretty standard inter-galactic war plot, with a few new wrinkles added in to create something original.  The Golden Tribe used to rule over the universea long time ago, but with its sudden disappearance, the Silver Tribe has been the dominant one throughout the universe.  However, with the rebellion of the humans, a war breaks out.  The Silver Tribe (superior beings), the Bronze Tribe (humans) and the Iron Tribe (an insect race) are the participants in this war.  What makes the war interesting is the battles fought between Nodos.  The Nodos - a powerful being that looks oddly similar to an Eva - are monsters that are hidden within the soul of people that are from the once-thought extinct Heroic Tribe.  Each Nodos has been sworn to oath set by the Golden Tribe that he/she must fulfill.\\n\\n\r\nThe character art is boring, enough said.  All of the characters look relatively plain and uninteresting.  And as a result, will not spark much interest in you, as the viewer, and will unfortunately, at times, make you become bored with the anime.  The animation, on the other hand, is pretty good.  A bunch of repeated frames for sure, but compared to the art, it's not so bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, although nothing remarkable as well, is pretty decent.  There are a few scores which you might start playing in your head a few times.  The voices to all the characters fit them well, but you can sense an apparent lack of emotion in all of them.  \\n\\n\r\nYou'll find your average set of protagonists and antagonists in this anime.  You have your basic good-willed princess, a commander who will fight for her,  and even a big-breasted female general.  Even Age, the main character, is nothing special, as his appearance will undoubtedly look familiar and you'll wish he never got that haircut after the first episode.   Probably the most annoying characters you'll find in this anime is the princess' brothers, who are your typical hungry-power people willing to sacrifice everyone for their gain.  They are a waste of space, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nHeroic Age would have garnered a bit of a higher score from me if it were not for the extremely uneventful and boring episodes that occur right in the middle of the anime.  The first nine or so shows are interesting, but then after that, there's another nine or ten in which the same thing seems to happen over and over again.  In addition, the constant unemotional speeches from everyone will have you yawning in no time.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the review I have written above, it seems that I made it out so that Heroic Age has no good points whatsoever, which is definitely not true and hence why I haven't given it a 1/10.  The Nodos battles are really epic and its interesting to see what kind of powers and attacks they develop.  You'll also be interested in the hint of love between Princess Deianeira and Age, which is rather amusing to watch.  You'll also see many reference to the Greek Mythology version of the Heroic Age and its always fun to see them and point them out to yourself.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Heroic Age is an anime to be seen if there is nothing else out there that you are interested in and want to pass your time.",

Mecha-monsters that constantly fight, a princess who constantly cries and people who keep talking about tribes and \u201ccontracts\u201d that don't make any sense to anyone, not even to the anime characters themselves. This show fails in a major way by making the show too complex and unintelligible. They didn't use their time wisely to explain all of these new concepts to the average-minded viewer, things like, \u201ctribes\u201d  or the importance of the \u201ccontracts\u201d,  the nature of these contracts, or go into further details of these \u201clabors\u201d. There was also ZERO character development! No downtime between battles toany real extent, no history or background of the characters, just that age likes to paint...basically. Boring! I like humans and people and human drama. Where's the tension? Where's the DRAMA?\\n\r\nOf course I love the art and animation, it's the same as Gundam SEED which is to say, it's pretty good. However, I think this series was really just an showcase for the art concepts and graphics and special F/X. Like why does the Captain's room have no walls? It's just a bunch of lights and LEDs against the backdrop of space and stars.  Also, the music is not that great, nothing to do back-flips over.\\n\r\nThe story makes no sense, it's all a bunch of mysticism and interplanetary mumbu-jumbo that doesn't make sense to anyone outside the anime and they do a terrible job relaying it to the viewer....so there's no connection there either!\\n\\n\r\nI'm a character driven person and this show did nothing for me, the characters were trite and clich\u00e9d. And you didn't get to really see them much at all except when they're delivering all these monologues and soliloquies about legends and Golden Tribes, ugh, I was so bored of it all! this show is more about giant space mecha-monsters and spaceships and planets. The character's behaviors are severely irrational and underdeveloped. OMG the silver tribe makes me want to barf! Especially the little silver girl/monster, one minute she's a cold bossy bitch then suddenly she goes ballistic for no apparent or tangible reason and practically destroys the \"universe\" [ugh, why must everything be on such a grand scale.....so unnecessary!] but then in the next moment she's crying saying she so alone, like no one loves her [COULD it be because you're a bitch, honey?]. Actually the whole the silver tribe is like this. They're supposedly this cold and \u201clogical\u201d people but somehow these emotions are popping up left and right, WTF! The blond princess with the constant crying also gets on my nerves yet ironically she never shod one tear when her both her brothers supposedly got fried. \\n\r\nWhat a boring anime, a lot of fancy F/X and cute character's but the story is a hot-ass mess. I was severely disappointed.",

For me it is a must see series.\r\nStory : 9\r\nThough the story may seem a bit classical for those of us who are fans of the sci-fi genre I want to assure you that it is non the less amazing. Yes it is the classic battle between humanity and the alien forces and yes there are heroes/champions for each of the warring factions but despite these cliched details the story is so much more. It is an extraordinary tale that depicts an awe inspiring journey of Age and the Princess towards the future not for the human raceor the Nodos or the other races but for the universe as whole. It kind of reminds me of the journey of Odysseus, the Greek hero who traveled the seas and encountered numerous perils and obstacles in his journey home and towards peace. I can keep going but I could never do justice to the story. In my humble opinion this an epic story filled with action, intrigue, chaos and dozens of feelings.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is another outstanding feature of this series. Though the art is not high class and edgy like newer anime series (Gundam 00, Code Geass, Tengen Toppa etc) it is truly remarkable. It gives off a vibe of older series that were created during the 80'2 and 90's. While watching Heroic Age I was constantly reminded of such series as Space battleship Yamato 2199, Captain Harlock, Gundam Wing etc. of course I do not claim that the art is the same as it was for these older series but that it just gives off a similar vibe. The artists managed to combine to very different art styles into one and the result is truly amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was pretty good. The opening and ending songs were well suited for this type of series and they managed to hook the viewer into watching them. The rest of the music throughout the series was very good as well. Each music piece complimented the scenes depicted. Music in this series managed to compliment the story telling and allowed the viewer to receive the anguish, sorrow, determination, joy etc of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 9\\n\\n\r\nEach of the main characters was written quite brilliantly. I, as a viewer, was able to follow the actions of our characters very easily. In essence all characters made sense. There was no part that confused me. Of course there were times were I disagreed and even cursed towards my screen but I think overall this fact made the characters more human and more believable. The one small issue I had with the character development is that certain things that occurred in the past were lost in a sense but to explain further I would have to spoil you. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall : 10\\n\\n\r\nOf course this series deserves a 10 +. This series has been extremely enjoyable and intriguing. There have few other series that I have enjoyed so much. everything about it was top notch. It is very rare for this level of quality work to be produced. To not see this series is to have missed something exceptional.",

            "content": "There are some many things wrong with this show.\r\nIt's a futuristic anime, done with the same animation tpe as the Gundam Seed and Destiny. The Gold Race set at a call to all intelligent races to enter space. There's the human race, known as the Iron Race, the Silver Race, the Heroic Race, and the Bronze Race anwser the call. Time passes and the Gold Race as left for another universe. The Heroic Race has disappeared. The Silver Race has taken power, with the help of the Bronze Race. In order to save the human race princess Deianeira travels to the far distant galaxy fortheir savior of the prophecies. They find a boy named Age who could help bring the human race to power.\\n\\n\r\nI really started out liking this anime, in one of my earlier blogs I even thought I would give it a 8, 9, or 10. Boy was I wrong, and disappointed in Heroic Age. Lets go over the things that are wrong with this anime. First the overall story started out with a good premise, but quickly became convoluted and incoherent. Than there's the one dimensional characters that have no depth to them. Finally there's the animation and battles. Both reminded me of Gundam Seed/Destiny, the more I watched. I swear the animation looks exactly like Gundam Seed/Destiny even though it's animated by different companies. I thought I was watching Gundam Seed/Destiny as I watched the battles. They were overblown big time, and ridiculous. Heroic Age had potential to be great, but let things go down hill fast.",

            "content": "Important: Forgive my english please. As a french person it's always very easy for me.\r\nI watch this serie by pure random choice on animeultima.com. I was searching for a sci-fi show and I notice that the art character were done by Hisashi Hirai, who's one of my favorite character designer. So I watch the show without understanding a lot of things at the beginning and it turns out to be one of the greatest sci-fi show I ever watch ( including anime and real tv serie/movie).\r\nStory: I'm not going to describe the story (after all, you read the synopsis, don't you?). The story began withan easy clich\u00e9: the only human raised by the golden race is the saviour of humanity, because he is the most powerfull of the five Nodos (space godzilla... just kidding). But I dindn't mind this clich\u00e9. The story follows a path of originality that I like. My only little complain: the Nodos are pretty much invicible and uber-powerfull. At least, there's a good reason why there are like this. Some people complain about this show for being to slow for his first half. I know this is not the most fast-paced action you can get, but it's a built up for an extremely good ending.\\n\r\nStory: For it's originality, despite some \"slow moments\", 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: A lot of ships were pretty well designed. The Argonaut is an awesome ship, the Silver Race have weird design, but I don't understand their bridge at all. The Bronze Race are some zerg caterpillars with acid attack. Although the ships can be more colored (silver, green and silver again), I  can't bring myself to hate this design.\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: One word: EARGASM!! An absolutely amazing soundtrack. The opening made by Angela (soukyuu no fafner, asura cryin') is an outstanding one. The ending is really cool. The soundtrack is a kickass one. If you have the chance to watch this show on a surronded system your gonna cry in joy. I tried it, it's totaly awesome.\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: An interresting cast with some \"dicks\" ( Dhianeila's brothers). Age is amusing for the most part, ignoring what's number, but understand every single words that Dhianeila tells him. Some people complain (again?!) about Age and Dhianeila for being almost \"perfect\" character. I can understand Age (although I don't agree), but I can't understand Dhianeila. She's not perfect, she just know when to take the right decision like a wise and old           captain (just kidding). I'll just say that this show needed a little bit more of background about his cast. The design of the characters is very good, but I think Hisashi Hirai need to put just a little bit of originality in his creations. Even so, I like his way of drawning.\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: I had a lot of fun watching this show. I was always looking forward to the next episode and I was never disappointed. The first half let you know what's going on and the second half kicks out with those big confrontations of flleet battles. An absolute fun watch!!\\n\r\nEnjoyement: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I don't understand why this show is so unknow to the anime public. You should try this show and then judge it. Of course, you need to like a little bit the sci-fi universe, but I can recommand this show to everyone. Just watch it and judge it. For me, it was an amazing discovery in this anime world.\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10",

            "content": "The anime is a futuristic anime where there are serveral races each trying to reach the same goal which is to become master of the galaxy after the dolden tribe left. The tale revolves around a ship of the iron tribe(humans) and their journey through war fighting and discovery.\r\nThe story is quite different from your usual futuristic anime, somethings like gundam  where you get several different parties fighting in a war. And the ultimate weapons instead of gundams are the heroic tribe which are people who can turn into big fighting robots. Though there is a dabble of fate and destiny in the storyi found it quite touching. There is a bit of romance which is only evident late in the anime, so don't expect much from romance in this anime. But it is quite a good story nonetheless with a deep meaning.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is quite similar to thatd of gundam seed you could say the main female lead looks like lacus clyne in gundam seed. I find this style of anime quite to my liking and there are no flaws in the anime,the scenaries are done up quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThe songs of the anime are quite good. I was especially entranced by the ending song Azurite, which was an insert song in certain episodes, this really brought out the mood of the setting and it was very sentimental and touching, the insert songs were done up quite well so i applaud the studio for their effort.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have some depth and carry a lot of meaning in their words and actions. The story focuses a lot of the main characters and the supporting characters are not so important. Morality is a a question that many of the characters think of and then theres the theme of fate and destiny and how the characters react to them. In the end, the characters each have thier roles to play to create a new path.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime because of the meaning that was portrayed in the anime. The fight scenes were also quite extravagant and i found it quite touching so it was generally quite entertaining, Though not the best since im a drama-romance fan, though there is a good deal of drama in this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i think the anime is worth watching, if you like action and adventure you will like this, the anime is not so much a mecha show though,so mecha fans should not have too high hopes for this.",

            "content": "We can all honestly say that a giant robot anime is not to original in this day and age, but this series is one the exceptions. This anime is like Gundam meets Tarzan as we experience the wild antics of Age, a prodigy with the powers of the Hero tribe. Along with the magical components of this story, everything else falls into place without any set-backs. VERY light humor sets a realistic feeling tone and travel through space makes it feel like problems are only a step away, seeing as everybody travels in the same space ship.\r\nThe actual parts and details of the story differthough. Let's break this down:\\n\\n\r\n1) Action-\\n\r\nFight scenes all have their own luster with a uniform style. Each scenario has some crucial detail that gives a fight it's own essence.\\n\\n\r\n2) Humor-\\n\r\nThe very short scenes are heavily outweighed by the drama so their abilities to reach you are easily outweighed. But I have to admit there are very rare moments where you will laugh.\\n\\n\r\n3) Romance-\\n\r\nSurprisingly, it is really good, but you have to step back after finishing the series to really appreciate it. Yeah, if you pay attention you would notice the cliff hanging love suspense, but it can be easily confused for drama.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10; I don' t recommend this to everybody though, stick to your preferred dramas if you don't like those \"traveling\" animes. The story here is really reminiscent of Gundam Seed/Destiny if you know what I mean.",

            "content": "Space... It was once considered by the people of Earth to be the final frontier. A boundless, infinite universe stood just beyond the reaches of our ever advancing technology. We expected there to be life out there in the universe, but we had no way of knowing that by leaving the comfort of our blue planet, we\u2019d be setting foot into a game of celestial thrones that was already eons in the making. As we entered this conflict, forced into the struggle for galactic dominance, we were dubbed the iron tribe. But with the regal albinos of the Silver tribe and the larvae-looking Bronze tribeteaming up against us, we were faced with the inevitability of not just defeat... But extinction.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, until one fateful day when Dhianeilla, the princess of the human race, and the crew of her space ship The Argonaut stumbled across a half-destroyed planet, inhabited predominately by terrestrial squids. Living amongst the squids, they found a childlike young man; Savage in appearance yet kind of heart, his name was Age, and he alone possessed the ability to defend us against the worst that our enemies could dish out. But will this curious young savior be enough? Is he strong enough to bring about an end to this horrible war? Is he heroic enough to do so with as little bloodshed as possible? Or will he fail, dooming us to obscurity? One thing is certain: Without Age, this frontier truly will be our final one.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Xebec is a name that I\u2019ve often heard spoken in painful, frustrated tones by many different reviewers. And hey, it\u2019s time to add my name to that list. If animation studios were being sold in the supermarket, Xebec would be the store-brand option... I\u2019m talking Great Value levels of cheapness. They\u2019re the same company that produced Love Hina and the first Negima series, and the 2D animation in Heroic Age is a slight improvement over those works, with much better use of coloring, but as far as basic animation goes, this is pretty much the same stiff, lifeless crap that we\u2019ve become used to seeing from them.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, I\u2019m still going to give credit where credit is due. The animation looks awful whenever characters are on screen, or with any shots that take place on land or inside the space ships, but when we leave those setting and venture out into open space, the switch in visual quality is like night-and-day. The 3D animation in Heroic Age is nothing short of beautiful. This series came out in 2007, so the CG looks a little dated, but it still holds up really well. The spaceships themselves look awesome at all times, but what\u2019ll really catch your eye is the expansive outer-space backgrounds, which are full of life and color... Although when it\u2019s sharing screen time with the 2D characters, the styles really don\u2019t mesh well together.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the character designs go, there\u2019s very little inspiration or originality here. The silver tribe... The primary antagonists of the series... Are emotionless, so of course they all have long white hair. Yeah, if you haven\u2019t seen an anime where the villain had long white hair, then you don\u2019t watch much anime. There are several characters who appear to have had their aesthetic lifted directly out of Leiji Matsumoto\u2019s sketchbook, and thinking back, the only designs that really stand out are that of Age and a few less humanoid aliens, such as the bronze tribe and his squid friends.\\n\\n\r\nOddly enough, the one aspect of the character design that stands out in my memory is the sheer number of baffling choices that the creators made in regard to the female characters\u2019 uniforms. On the low end of the scale, you have several members of Dhianeila\u2019s crew... Including the princess herself... Who are wearing uniforms so skin-tight that you\u2019d swear they were painted on. I actually kind of wish that were the case, because otherwise, those poor girls are experiencing the most uncomfortable wedgies in human history. That, and somehow the suits indent enough to show off their belly buttons. On the high end of the scale, there are a few high-ranking female characters whose outfits were designed to have gaping, cleavage-baring holes in the front, and I would LOVE to hear the practical applications of this dress-code choice. I highly doubt they did that for the sake of sexiness or fan-service, because with Xebec\u2019s art quality, one poor character\u2019s cleavage looks more like ass-cheeks than anything else in most shots.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is your standard sci-fi fantasy fare... If you\u2019ve seen any anime like this, you\u2019ve heard soundtracks exactly like this...  But the English dub, on the other hand, is much more unique. I\u2019ve heard quite a few bad dubs from Funimation before. I\u2019ve heard them release dubs that were written poorly, directed poorly, or cast poorly. But through it all, I\u2019ve always felt that they were at least trying. No, phoned-in dubs were always more of an ADV thing than a Funimation thing. Heroic Age is the first dub I\u2019ve heard from them where it sounds like most of the people involved just didn\u2019t care.\\n\\n\r\nIn a cast full of late-2000s Funimation regulars, there are several actors who didn\u2019t have to reach very far into their bags of stock voices to find the right one for their respective characters. Monica Rial plays her usual squeaky-cheerful voice, aged up slightly for the dual roles of the twins Mail and Tail. Luci Christian raises her voice ever so slightly for the role of Dhianeila\u2019s personal attendant Aneasha, and Greg Ayres does his usual Greg Ayres thing for the meek Mehitak. Think Negi Springfield, but without the accent. Colleen Clinikenbeard plays another deep-voiced tough woman, Christopher Sabat plays what he likes to call a \u2018coffee break role,\u2019 and so on and so forth.\\n\\n\r\nVic Mignona plays a scheming antagonist, which is fun to listen to, but he barely gets any lines. The only actors who seem to have brought any genuine effort to the table are Cherami Leigh, who plays the tortured Lekty, a member of the Silver Tribe who slowly learns affection and emotion with the help of a fellow Nodos who\u2019s been tasked with protecting her... Cherami put out a compelling amount of pain through this character\u2019s development... And Brina Palencia, who gracefully dances the line between adorable mascot and helpful navigator in her role as the ship\u2019s AI system, Bee No Bee.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then you have the two main voice actors. I don\u2019t even know where to begin with this one. J Michael Tatum plays the titular character, and it\u2019s probably the only time I\u2019ve ever heard him attempt to do a high-pitched, wistful voice. Thank God for that. Every single line he utters sounds like he\u2019s making fun of Johnny Yong Bosch. Tatum generally has a very pleasant, soothing voice, and his performance as Age is proof that he should stick to that voice as often as possible.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, his female co-star is still worse. Caitlin Glass plays the role of Princess Dhianeila, and I am sorry to say this about any character voiced by her, but she will put you right the hell to sleep. She gives monotone a new meaning with her soft-voiced, droning delivery. She sounds like a lazy LOTR-style opening narration, which makes it even more grating to the attention span when she doles out exposition about long-winded prophecies or soliloquies about Age's feelings.\\n\\n\r\nTogether, these two voice actors turn the series into a boring, dull slog that\u2019s often a chore to watch. They have absolutely no chemistry, which is insane because... And I can\u2019t stress this enough... They\u2019re the voice actors for Isaac and Miria in Baccano. Yeah, these two one-note windbags are directly linked to the most electrifying and entertaining couple in anime history. This is the only thing that ever surprised me about this series. The Japanese actors for both characters are far superior, able to hit the same basic tones while showing so much more personality in the process.\\n\\n\r\nThe show had a whole slew of people working on the adaptive writing, and yes, it feels it. There were several different writers and ADR directors taking turns like a revolving door, and out of the three script writers attached to the project, two of them were actually good. I\u2019ve always known Monica Rial to be a talented writer, and she\u2019s always been able to adapt material in such a way that it\u2019s accessible without losing it\u2019s intent or meaning. I\u2019m new to Brandon Potter, but he did a decent job as well.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s when we talk about the third writer... J Michael Tatum... That we run into some serious problems. He\u2019s a generally well-liked actor, and rightfully so... But when it comes to scripting a dub, he\u2019s become notorious for over-writing. My least favorite kind of writers are the ones who think they\u2019re better than the material, and take every possible opportunity to make themselves look like the cleverest person in the room, which Tatum does by replacing subtle and in-character dialogue with over-used cliches, purple prose, and bizarrely out-of-place idioms that make a mockery of the text while, in some cases, changing the intent of it all together.\\n\\n\r\nHere, I\u2019ll give you an example from episode sixteen. At one point, one of Age\u2019s enemies is defeated, and brought onto the Argonaut. When confronting Age, he expresses reluctance to the idea of fighting him again, and is relieved when he hears that they don\u2019t have to. This makes sense in character, because this guy\u2019s always been pacifistic throughout the story, and the idea of engaging in an all out brawl with Age in the middle of a populated spaceship will cause countless casualties. But in the dub, Tatun changes his line to \u201cSo, you\u2019re not going to hurt me?\u201d Down-grading it from a sentiment of compassion to a sentiment of selfish cowardice. And yes, there are worse examples in here. Definitely stick to the subtitles on this one.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve been putting off reviewing this series for a few years now... No exaggeration there, I\u2019m dead serious... And in that time, it\u2019s always been floating over my head as something I would have to tackle eventually. But there were two problems. The first one was that I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d be able to watch it all the way through a second time. And the second was that, as many problems as I have with it, I had no idea how I was going to present my biggest problems with this series. So now that the time has finally come, I think I\u2019m going to start with the problem that I like to bring up whenever someone asks me why I didn\u2019t like this series... Let\u2019s talk about the title character.\\n\\n\r\nAge is a kind-hearted, childish savage who\u2019s not human by birth. He\u2019s one of the last surviving remnants of a tyrannical race of warriors that were almost completely wiped out by a more powerful force. He\u2019s picked up by a crew consisting of mostly humans, and a lot of quirky hijinks ensue as a result of their many differences. It\u2019s eventually revealed that he has the ability to transform into a giant, ferocious monster with it\u2019s own name that\u2019s unique to his, and he has to fight the other few remnants of his species if he wants to protect the human race from extinction. In other words, he\u2019s Goku. Yup. Just Goku. He doesn\u2019t have the personality, depth, or charm of Goku, but when you get right down to it, he was ripped wholesale out of the DBZ universe.\\n\\n\r\nNow, is unoriginality a bad thing? Not necessarily. Bleach ripped it\u2019s initial premise straight out of Yuyu Hakusho, and I actually like the first three seasons of Bleach MORE than it\u2019s predecessor. But then you have my next problem... Heroic Age is really stupid. This show knows about as much about outer space physics as I did in elementary school. There are plenty of rules you\u2019re allowed to break in science fiction... Sound and color don\u2019t exist in space, but very few Sci-fis care about that. Heroic Age breaks the rules you\u2019re allowed to break, as well as the ones you aren\u2019t. Not only do many of the characters move through open space as though they were swimming under-water, but in episode two, we see the main character digging a hole through the hull of the Argonaut in order to attack the villains waiting outside.\\n\\n\r\nHey, do you remember Jason X, the Friday the 13th movie where Jason Voorhies kills a bunch of people in outer space? Pretty cool, huh? One of the characters was killed when Jason broke a hole in the hull from outside, and she was sucked through that hole. That was the dumbest movie in an entire franchise of dumb movies, but even THAT story knew that when you compromise the hull of a space ship, shit goes terribly wrong. Also, I get that Age and the other Nodos can breathe in space, but an inhuman biology doesn\u2019t explain outer space wind blowing through their hair. Someone had to animate that.\\n\\n\r\nBut much like unoriginality, stupidity is not a deal breaker. There are plenty of shows that were awesome, despite having the IQ of mayonnaise, but they usually offer up some redeeming qualities to make up for it. Gurren Lagann is stupid, but it has so much energy and confidence that you just can\u2019t help but believe in it. Knights of Sidonia is incredibly stupid... Probably even more so than Age, now that I think about it... But it\u2019s so creative and sincere that it honestly just comes off as fun and adorable. Heroic Age doesn\u2019t have anything like that. In fact, rather than making up for it\u2019s stupidity, it compounds that problem with it\u2019s insistence on looking smarter and deeper than it actually is.\\n\\n\r\nAt the start of this review, I gave a heavily simplified(and not 100% accurate) plot summary of this series. What I left out was all the over-complicated pulp. Heroic Age goes up it\u2019s own ass to establish a long-winded and often self-contradictory lore about the many tribes vying for control of the universe, which never serves as anything other than an explanation for the setting. There are scattered references to Greek mythology, namely to the five ages of man, but these references are in name alone, and the tribes named after them have little to nothing to do with the ages they correspond to. The only reason Age is a descendant of the Heroic Age is because the creators wanted to emphasize how heroic HE was, never mind the fact that they\u2019re also comparing a brutal race of murderers to one of the most noble ages of the five. The tribes could just have easily been named after different ice cream brands, with the show being called Haagen-Daas Age, and it would have had just as much depth to it.\\n\\n\r\nBut is pretending to have depth or meaning a deal breaker? Not on it\u2019s own, but I\u2019m sorry, \u2018stupid\u2019 and \u2018pretentious\u2019 are not good bed-fellows. This show would have been a lot easier to watch if it had dropped all attempts at undeserved profundity, and had just told the simple story that I mentioned earlier... Only it wouldn\u2019t, because of this series\u2019 final, and biggest, problem. Heroic Age, at it\u2019s core, is just very badly written.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a ton of characters floating around in it, but Age is the only one who even gets the slightest hint of a backstory, and not one of them have any complex motivations. The two main characters... Age and Dhianeilla... have no personality outside of the fact that they\u2019re good people who are always right about everything, and everyone else just exists to support or oppose them. I\u2019ve seen this show twice, and I cannot describe a single one of it\u2019s characters with anything more than a two-sentence explanation of what they are and who they\u2019re connected to.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it apparently isn\u2019t enough that I don\u2019t feel invested in any of the characters... I can\u2019t even enjoy the action of these epic space battles because of how muddled and poorly edited these multi-episode set pieces are. You\u2019ll notice quickly that during these long battles, there is a LOT going on, at many different locations, involving many different characters, often at different times. You\u2019ll get a few seconds of Age fighting his brethren, followed by a cut to Princess Expositia explaining to us what he\u2019s going through, followed by a cut to the political squabble involving her scheming brothers, to a cut to the other Nodos\u2019 loitering around and discussing their lot in life, to a conversation someone had with Age earlier, and by the time they finally cut back to Age\u2019s fight in current time, I\u2019ve all but forgotten what he was doing there in the first place, which is the final nail in the coffin for a series I had to struggle to care about.\\n\\n\r\nHerioic Age is available from Funimation. The old releases are still available in relatively affordable halves, but you can get a much better deal by going with the SAVE release, which you can find pretty much anywhere for between fifteen and twenty dollars. The manga, which released it\u2019s first volume during the initial run of the series, is pretty much the same story told from another character\u2019s perspective, and it\u2019s not available in the states.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t like Heroic Age. I also don\u2019t hate Heroic Age. Hell, I don\u2019t anything Heroic Age. I gained nothing from this series, and in exchange, I lost way too much time on a series that I\u2019m going to forget in less than a week. It\u2019s biggest crime isn\u2019t the fact that it\u2019s stupid, pretentious, badly animated, or generic. It\u2019s biggest crime is that it\u2019s boring. I can stare at the screen for several episodes in a row, with no distractions, and I still have to constantly rewind to pick up on what the hell I missed in regard to what\u2019s happening. I\u2019m glad to finally put this turkey behind me, and I look forward to forgetting it exists. I give Heroic Age a 3/10.",

            "content": "Story\r\nRight of the bat \"Heroic Age\" seeems like any other space opera. However, it has arich story that derives many of its elements from Greek mythology, ecspecially Hercules. The plot itself has enough twists, turns, and tragedy to keep the audience wanting more, after the initial start-up period of about ten episodes. Yes, that's right, it has a slow start. A VERY slow start. Regardless, once it gets going it is hard to stop watching, unless you're Jupiter (inside joke). I can honestly say it is one of the msot clever loose adaptions I have ever seen.\r\nArt\r\n\"Heroic Age\" incorporates so much CGI into their animationtat sometimes it's hard to tell what is handdrawn. Usually, I would disdain from this practice but this time around I didn't mind it so much. It may just be because I am growing weary of arguing for handdrawn and against CG. The character desgins and other 2D aspects of it are done well, some characters are pretty generic but others really stay with you: Age, Mehitaka, ect. Also, the Heroic Race's mech desgins (though they are technically not mechs) are some of the most original and I must say, BADASS, desgins I have ever seen. Bellecross, ecspecially.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nNothing special sound wise. The opening theme is good, catchy even, but not really memorable. Any background music suits the show but isn't a draw. Voice acting is good, they really had a talented group of actors. Yui Ishikawa did a wonderful job with Princess Dhianeila.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nWhat I really like about \"Heroic Age\" is that, like many Miyazaki films, it is devoid of any true villians. There are people who do villionous things (Rome Ro, Dhianeila's elder Brothers) but everyone are really just people with their own agendas. All the characters feel as if they are acting int hte best interest of their people, no one is out to destroy the world.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, \"Heroic Age\" is a wonderful series. It does has a slow start and has sort of an acquired sci-fi taste. It isn't for everyone, I would reccomend ir more to sci-fi fans more than traditional anime fans. However, if space operas are your thing, than this show is for you.",

            "content": "Okay, so after watching so many mecha, fantasy, action animes. I have never ever felt so satisfied when it comes to a story like this one. I am lucky and blessed to stumble upon such a beautiful masterpiece.\r\nThe story is somewhat intriguing, it makes you wanna fall at the edge of your seat as you anticipate every episode, fearing for what will happen next.\r\nThe story is based upon the threat of extinction of all humankind along with the struggles of political, military, space, survival and superpowers (Planetary Destruction kind of power).\r\nThree superior races, the silver tribe and the bronze tribe along with the relics ofthe all powerful heroic tribe, who was forced to serve inferior beings as a punishment due to their wild behavior by the golden tribe, converge against such a newly primitive race (humankind/iron tribe) thus forcing the humans to leave earth to search for a new hope on far away galaxies. To prevent such demise, a princess took the call to search for the one who has been prophesied by an ancient race (the golden tribe) a 120 years ago before leaving. He is said to be the one who will save all humanity carrying a huge burden along with his 12 labors that must be done no matter what at all costs. But against all odds, political and other entities that threats their very existence, they all persevere towards the end. Kodus to such a very well laid story, i really appreciate it. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the anime does not say any romance in it, but actually, it does, it has some cute moments. The ending is beautiful and i like to think that it is just the begining. I am really hoping for a second season.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are quite interesting, the art is not that beautiful and lovely but the animation sure does makes me wanna see more action.\\n\\n\r\nSo that is all i have to say, this anime now belongs to one of my favorites, a 10/10.\\n",

I havent seen a anime anything like this, sure theres alot of space,save the planet type animes but this one took that basic idea and came up with a amazing version. The basics may be the same but the rest was unique to this anime. The anime itself got straight to the point, within the first episode you understood a bit of what this anime was going to be like. The anime was an all around amazing achievment in a sworm of clique anime's it certainly stood out.\r\n~Art~\r\n I can't say this was the best are because it wasnt, it wasamazing but sometimes the battle scenes when the two people clashed it was a little hard to make out but only once or twice so other than that it was an amazing mix of 2D and 3D! \\n\r\n~Sound~\\n\r\n The music for the anime was...not great, it was a little repetitive but the sound effects for the anime itself was spot on and if you were on a space ship getting attacked this is certainly what i imagine it would sound like. \\n\r\n~Character~\\n\r\n Now, All the characters were unique in their own way. Instead of a big macho or cool and collected main male role the male was like a new born child in the begining and you could see him grow, guess thats what happens when your stuck alone on a planet for god knows how many years and have never learned the basics. Hes refered to as a monkey alot, i loved him. The rest of the characters were a little shallow but were amazinly well developed. The only characters that annoyed me were the Princess's two brothers, i was hoping they would die the whole time. \\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\r\n A-M-A-Z-I-N-G The anime was fabulous to watch and kept you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The characters were badass icons that will be remembered forever for their awesome display of the future of anime. \\n\r\n~Overall~\\n\r\n Overall i would give it a 9/10, the only reason i dont give it a 10 is because the ending didnt explain much but its the only way it could have ended. I still adored the ending though, adorably awesome. Anyway so if you love Anime of any kind i suggest you watch this anime due to its amazing graphics,unique plot, Incedible characters, beautiful art and one hell of a fan base!",

Every battle is big with an enormous amount of human soldiers, ships, and alien species. As the series progresses the battles get bigger, more impressive and much more destructive. Personally I feel like based on the battles alone I feel like this anime is worthat least checking out. Also while this is considered a Mecha in some regards, its done in a much similar way it is done in Code Geass, where the Mechs are just this anime's version of a super soldier and are just as destructible as anything else is, which I feel is much more exciting.\\n\r\nThe characters in the series are nothing too special, and are none too unique, but there are a few characters that you will get attached to and that's when the series picks up, because then it matters to you if they die. \\n\r\nAs far as music goes, the only song of interest is the opening which is very good, but not so much so that it worthy of extra special note (other than this one of course) but nonetheless is a catchy tune and you will find yourself listening to it out of choice at the beginning of each episode.\\n\r\nOverall, the story and characters are nothing new but are done well so while you have a good idea how the series will end, the journey itself is the most enjoyable part. I'd recommend this anime simply based on the battles alone, they are so big and impressive that they (with good reason) take center stage. If you have the time and are in the mood for an epic space survival full of large scale battle, give this one a try, because personally I never get tired of it.\\n",

            "content": "Had I seen it earlier in my anime career, I have a hunch that Heroic Age could have become one of my favorite series. For starters, my very favorite--Busou Renkin--was produced by the same studio Xebec just a year before, and the similarities in animation style seem pretty obvious to me. While today I find any and everything to nitpick, my younger self might have been enchanted by the grand scope and simplistic characters. Sadly, I think Heroic Age may be widely misunderstood by both viewers and potential viewers, which is a shame because behind the confusion surrounding its premise and backstory lies a wholesomestory about an innocent boy who wants to make a better life for his friends. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall look of Heroic Age is not too shabby. The character designs are charming, if a bit bland, but I can't say that the Argonaut crew costumes do much for me. It's a shame that this series isn't about the mechs, because they look pretty sick. The main combatants--the Nodos--are strikingly intimidating, with their otherworldly organic features. The animation quality is pretty consistent, and I don't think there were any glaring drops in animation quality. The Nodos fight scenes are all at least decently animated, even if they did foolishly abandon the stock footage for Age's transformation early on. Putting it side by side with Busou Renkin I can definitely tell they're produced by the same studio. However, I think Heroic Age does a better job of keeping characters on model.\\n\\n\r\nIt should be no surprise that Studio Xebec employed all of its 3DCG resources for this series, and the show benefits greatly from it. The large amount of space ships and laser battles look solid and consistent in 3D. There are a few instances of the worm-type enemies being rendered in 3D which look kind of awkward, but they're few and far between. There's a striking 3D attack animation which starts to show up in the final act of the story, and it makes it look every bit as terrifying as it's supposed to be. In general most of the digital effects were expertly implemented, which is what I've come to expect from Xebec.\\n\\n\r\nI can't find as much to say about the sound in Heroic Age because I didn't find it all that engaging. Some of the Nodos sound downright bone chilling, with monstrous, otherworldly roars that can of course be heard all across outer space. The soundtrack is somewhat middle of the road. Many of the slower, emotional tracks are pretty powerful, but most of the battle themes and miscellaneous scores just fall flat for me. The opening theme has an energetic blend of genres that I find undeniably infectious, but the slower ending theme doesn't hold my attention very long. In Japanese, the voice cast is solid, but none of the performances really felt outstanding. I only bothered to watch one episode in English, which failed to captivate me.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Heroic Age is perhaps it's most well developed aspect, as well as that which may confound most viewers. The jist of it is not too hard to comprehend, but it's always hinted at in the least revealing manner possible. Characters will prattle on about the advanced ancient races of the universe as if everyone understands--which in that universe they mostly do, but we as the audience do not. Even though a friend of mine had given me the rundown of the lore before I ever started watching, I still felt a bit confused at times. This leads to a lot of what feels like wasted screen time early on that could have been used for more character development or straightforward exposition.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is pretty decent, seeing our main characters aboard the Argonaut amass an army and lead a harrowing campaign across the galaxy. On both sides of the mid-climax the pacing feels a bit slow, but it picks back up. A few allegiances shift towards the end, but it's not an abrupt or unwelcome shift. The finale was sweet and satisfying, and gave me some heavy Gurren Lagann vibes. Something of note to the critical thinkers who watch this: When you have characters like the Nodos who can destroy planets with a sneeze there arise some... Not quite plot holes, but unsound war strategies to nitpick. I can't really get into those without spoilers, so I'll leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Heroic Age are not all terribly developed or complex, but for the most part they're not annoying. It does a good job of building up the Argonaut crew and their friendship with Age early on, so much so that when they lost some screen time around the middle I genuinely missed them!  A couple of the Nodos characters are a bit flat and nondescript and the Silver Tribe are not really characters, but I think their tribe is pretty interesting as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nSo who should watch Heroic Age? I would say give it a try if you're ready for some cute character friendships, insanely large scale fleet battles, planet shattering punches, and a backstory that may be difficult to decipher, but is not totally necessary to enjoy the action.",

            "content": "Every genre has certain themes that are considered its staples - the building blocks of stories that have been, or are yet to be told. One of the most common elements in science fiction is the Earth being attacked by an alien force with superior technology, and there are numerous stories about this topic in everything from radio plays to comic books (with a few Hollywood blockbusters thrown in for good measure). These tales are usually resolved by the use of human ingenuity and courage, together with a healthy dose of serendipity (the battleship just happened to be there).\r\nBut what happens when the enemy reallyis unbeatable?\\n\\n\r\nHeroic Age is set in a future where Earth has been conquered by two alien races that are hell-bent on the total annihilation of the ones they call the \"Iron Tribe\". Over a century has passed and humanity continues to live in hiding across the universe, hoping and praying that the saviour promised by the all-powerful Golden Tribe would appear. After a short introduction concerning the major tribes in the series, the story begins with the spectral image of Princess Dianeira Y Laisha Arturia Ol Yunos floating in space as she attempts to locate the traces of a ship that has been lost for over 120 years. Together with the crew of the Argonaut she has journeyed through uncharted areas of the cosmos, and after four long years of searching it seems as though their quest may end on a half-destroyed planet that appears to be cut off from the rest of space.\\n\\n\r\nThat world is Olone, and upon it lives a young man called Age (and his tentacled friend Food).\\n\\n\r\nScience fiction tends to be a pretty common genre in anime, but only a few shows can truly call themselves space operas - and even amongst those Heroic Age is more than a little unusual. Much of the plot has been inspired by greek mythology - in particular the legends surrounding Hercules - and this is very clearly reflected in not just the nomenclature or the tasks given to the Nodos, but also in the language used throughout the series. The narrative adopts a measured, formal tone which may not sit well with viewers who want a frenetic pace and minute-to-minute excitement - even though this approach is fitting because of the heavy classical influencel.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, Heroic Age does contain a lot of combat and tension, but instead of the usual gung-ho attitude of other space-based anime (certain parts of the Macross and Gundam franchises for example), there's a tangible sense of desperation within the series. This stems from the fact that humanity is very clearly outnumbered, outgunned, and vastly inferior in terms of technology - factors which place far more emphasis on the need for a miracle, and like all such things the Nodos are both a blessing and a curse.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of design the characters are something of a mixed bag. The clothing for the humans is generally in keeping with the plot (utilitarian outfits for the most part), but their features are often unremarkable. As for the aliens, aside from the insectoid Bronze tribe and Food's species on Olone, everyone seems to be humanoid. It would have been nice if a little more imagination had been applied to the other inhabitants of the universe - variety is the spice of life after all. That said, the Nodos are interesting as they look more like an armoured creation of Doctor Moreau - which gives them a degree of familiarity, but also makes them appear far more monstrous than every other alien species.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter animation is surprisingly consistent throughout the series, and while the usage of CG is generally good (the transformation sequences or the pitched space battles for example), there are several moments that are decidedly clumsy in both execution and integration. Thankfully these are relatively minor issues that don't really have any impact on proceedings, and the show features some great audio-visual effects and choreography (although the mechanical servo noise used for Belcross has caused some confusion about the Nodos).\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that people will remember about Heroic Age is the exceptional music. The score is filled with tracks that appeal to any number of human emotions, and in all honesty the entire soundtrack (especially the main theme), seems to have two main purposes - add to the atmosphere of the story and make the viewer feel just a little bit epic.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening sequence is a decent compilation of the main characters and a few action scenes, combined with Gravitation by Japanese pop band Angela - and thankfully there's almost nothing that could be counted as a spoiler. Each episode ends with Azurite - a melancholy ballad sung by Urakabe Tae - and the accompanying imagery shows Dianeira walking along the shore alone and then floating in space above a planet. Now this may seem like a fairly typical anime closing sequence, but it's actually a rather clever bit of foreshadowing that fits very well once the viewer understands the context.\\n\\n\r\nPossibly the biggest issue with Heroic Age is the dialogue - in particular because of the formality inherent in the series. The Japanese script is rather cumbersome in its use of language and is filled with repetitions of words and phrases  - sometimes just in one scene. Thankfully this approach fits the tone of the anime and the experienced voice cast have managed to overcome this hurdle to deliver some good performances. Unfortunately the English dub is even more convoluted, and things only get worse with the use of incorrect nomenclature (Dianela should actually be Dianeira - after the wife of Hercules, Age is pronounced Eiji, and so on). It's clear that the rewriters have tried too hard to turn the series into an animated saga poem, and many of the voice actors audibly struggle with their lines during certain monologues and declamations.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, if the viewer is able to move past these issues then they're likely to find some rather interesting characters.\\n\\n\r\nHeroic Age is filled with lots of people who have their own beliefs and circumstances, but it's the numerous questions that surround the Nodos, the tasks assigned to them, and their purpose in the universe that lead to evolution of several major supporting roles on both sides of the war. In addition to this the series clearly highlights the dual nature of humanity as both protectors and destroyers - which is something of a rarity in the genre - and the repercussions of these acts have a lasting effect on storyline.\\n\\n\r\nDianeira isn't the typical vapid lead female, but she is a bit too kind, trusting and forgiving for her own good - especially where her brothers are concerned. She also displays a great deal of courage on a variety of occasions, not the least of which is her decision to lead the crew of the Argonaut across uncharted space while the two most powerful tribes in the universe try to kill them. Her character is particularly unusual because of the dichotomy of her role - she is both protected by the crew of the Argonaut, but also acts as their guide and protector across space.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand Age is something of a conundrum - which is why there are a few misconceptions about him. He is a teenager who has been young for a very long time (over 120 years), and has an innocent mind but possesses knowledge of the future. He can be charming and endearing at times, but also terrifying in his rage - and his straightforward mentality hides a surprisingly deep character. His childhood with beings who are effectively gods and his years sharing his body with Belcross - a surviving member of the legendary Heroic Tribe - have effectively isolated him from the race  that he is fated to protect, but his carefree attitude and sunny disposition add some much-needed comic relief to the story. More than anything, he is a departure from the usual heroes found in anime as he is not driven by courage or the desire to protect his friends, but by faith in the future that he has been shown.\\n\\n\r\nHeroic Age has a lot in common with shows like Battlestar Galactica (the new version), Ulysses 31, Guin Saga, and surprisingly - Shingeki no Kyojin, and fans of those titles may find themselves on familiar ground with the storyline.  The layers of subtext about the nature of man and humanity's place in the universe fit very well with the narrative and themes of the show, and the series contains a lot more symbolism than one might expect (the similarity between Dianeira's astral projections and the figureheads found on sailing ships, the five tribes being named after Hesiod's Ages of Man, the number of labours assigned to each Nodos, and more).\\n\\n\r\nThe decision to adopt a cerebral approach to a very common theme in science fiction and to follow classical themes and influences has created a space opera that - although formal - adds a dose of intelligence and thoughtfulness to the action and tension. The show may not be for everybody, but those who do give it a chance will understand why the name \"Heroic Age\" is so appropriate.",

            "content": "Heroic Age is a Space, Sci-fi, Action, Adventure with a story basically about mankind's struggle to exist in the galaxy and to carry out instructions laid out by the Golden Tribe. The basic premise of the story itself is great but not original, but at least it's made easy to understand with the superb intros in the first couple of episode. There happen to be some similarities in this anime's plot and Star Wars IV and some other sci-fi anime; Vandread and Gundam Seed. So this is an anime Star Wars fans can enjoy however don't expect to see any lightsaber duels.\r\nThe battles in thisanime are pretty spectacular, which is basically composed of thousands of mechs, space fighters and aliens, plus throw in a Nodos or two. These are animated very well which mixes drawn animation and 3DCG and is to the point, where something as insignificant as Age transforming into the Bellcross becomes a spectacle however there will always remain some who won't like the CG. The space battles between huge fleets are amazing but they later lose their affect, when some scenes are later reused. Also when a single Nodos has the power to easily wipe out a planet from the face of the galaxy, it makes all the huge superbly animated space battles seem like such a waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is fantastic to listen to with a superb orchestra score that's especially good when it comes to the battles but it lacks variety. The opening theme is also really great and stands out from others I've heard.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime series had a great deal of potential as the story began to develop however there's a turning point, which stopped the series from living up to its expectation. Apart from the several noticeable flaws, like the characters' personalities, reused battle scenes and illogical story, this was a pretty enjoyable sci-fi series. So don't let the negative reviews stop you from watching this however for those who aren't fans of Space anime should steer clear from this one.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

And the pace does improve as the anime goes on.\r\nThe story I think is a very enjoyable one. It is very original, having several unique qualities.\r\nIt fallows the 'classic' way of doing things. Introduces characters, establishes personalities and let's you get to know the characters, then puts the story into full force.\r\nan 8 on story from me.\r\nArt:\r\nFor me, the art was very strange at first. Having an unfamiliar look, at least out of the thingsI'd seen before I'd never seen an art quite like it.  \\n\r\nThe characters are very thin and tall, and the eyes have something about the pupils which I fine interesting. In the beginning I didn't like the art, but I grew to love it as I watched the show and as an artist I now find it very fun to draw.\\n\r\nA 10 on art from me.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music:\\n\r\nThe sound effects were normal. Nothing wrong there. They did what they should do, added to the experience as a whole. I do remember liking how they used the sound effects for the Nodos.\\n\r\nThe music was nothing special. I can't even remember the opening or ending song. Though that means I didn't dislike it either I suppose.\\n\r\nTaking both into account I'll give sound/music a 7.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nLike most shows there were characters I liked and didn't like. But there were far more I liked then did not. So that's  plus. ^^\\n\r\nThe characters are all interesting in their own ways and the show has several memorable characters in my opinion.\\n\r\nAs I said earlier character development was handled well I thought.\\n\r\nGiving you just enough to fall for the characters without spending ages building up pasts. Very well done. A 10 on character from me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nPersonally I enjoyed this anime quite a lot. But I didn't at first. This show has to grow on people I think. It has a very odd feel to it so I don't think it's for just everyone. You will probably want to already have a liking for mech shows.\\n\r\nThough the show has several things about it which could make it appeal even to those uninterested in mech shows previously. I think it has a great potential to be loved by anyone willing to take the time get into it.\\n\r\nA 9 on enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI'll give it a 9 overall.\\n\r\nVery good. Not perfect, but closer then most shows come. ^_^\\n\r\nI highly recommend it.",

            "content": "So, take one part Neon Genesis Evangelion, one part Mobile Suit Gundam and one part of extremely boring political intrigue, mix thoroughly and boil for 26 episodes, and you will receive a product that equals Heroic Age.  Even though the first few episodes held so much promise for this anime series, the repetition of battles and the boring political talk between plain looking characters is what takes the heroic out of the anime, Heroic Age.\r\nThe story is your pretty standard inter-galactic war plot, with a few new wrinkles added in to create something original.  The Golden Tribe used to rule over the universea long time ago, but with its sudden disappearance, the Silver Tribe has been the dominant one throughout the universe.  However, with the rebellion of the humans, a war breaks out.  The Silver Tribe (superior beings), the Bronze Tribe (humans) and the Iron Tribe (an insect race) are the participants in this war.  What makes the war interesting is the battles fought between Nodos.  The Nodos - a powerful being that looks oddly similar to an Eva - are monsters that are hidden within the soul of people that are from the once-thought extinct Heroic Tribe.  Each Nodos has been sworn to oath set by the Golden Tribe that he/she must fulfill.\\n\\n\r\nThe character art is boring, enough said.  All of the characters look relatively plain and uninteresting.  And as a result, will not spark much interest in you, as the viewer, and will unfortunately, at times, make you become bored with the anime.  The animation, on the other hand, is pretty good.  A bunch of repeated frames for sure, but compared to the art, it's not so bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, although nothing remarkable as well, is pretty decent.  There are a few scores which you might start playing in your head a few times.  The voices to all the characters fit them well, but you can sense an apparent lack of emotion in all of them.  \\n\\n\r\nYou'll find your average set of protagonists and antagonists in this anime.  You have your basic good-willed princess, a commander who will fight for her,  and even a big-breasted female general.  Even Age, the main character, is nothing special, as his appearance will undoubtedly look familiar and you'll wish he never got that haircut after the first episode.   Probably the most annoying characters you'll find in this anime is the princess' brothers, who are your typical hungry-power people willing to sacrifice everyone for their gain.  They are a waste of space, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nHeroic Age would have garnered a bit of a higher score from me if it were not for the extremely uneventful and boring episodes that occur right in the middle of the anime.  The first nine or so shows are interesting, but then after that, there's another nine or ten in which the same thing seems to happen over and over again.  In addition, the constant unemotional speeches from everyone will have you yawning in no time.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the review I have written above, it seems that I made it out so that Heroic Age has no good points whatsoever, which is definitely not true and hence why I haven't given it a 1/10.  The Nodos battles are really epic and its interesting to see what kind of powers and attacks they develop.  You'll also be interested in the hint of love between Princess Deianeira and Age, which is rather amusing to watch.  You'll also see many reference to the Greek Mythology version of the Heroic Age and its always fun to see them and point them out to yourself.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Heroic Age is an anime to be seen if there is nothing else out there that you are interested in and want to pass your time.",

That, or I haven't see that many anime shows. It doesn't involve government and politics like some do, which I don't really care for.The pace is just right for this series and it is one out of many that doesn't have any filler episodes.

            "content": "Heroic Age, what a boring anime! Mecha-monsters that constantly fight, a princess who constantly cries and people who keep talking about tribes and \u201ccontracts\u201d that don't make any sense to anyone, not even to the anime characters themselves. This show fails in a major way by making the show too complex and unintelligible. They didn't use their time wisely to explain all of these new concepts to the average-minded viewer, things like, \u201ctribes\u201d  or the importance of the \u201ccontracts\u201d,  the nature of these contracts, or go into further details of these \u201clabors\u201d. There was also ZERO character development! No downtime between battles toany real extent, no history or background of the characters, just that age likes to paint...basically. Boring! I like humans and people and human drama. Where's the tension? Where's the DRAMA?\\n\r\nOf course I love the art and animation, it's the same as Gundam SEED which is to say, it's pretty good. However, I think this series was really just an showcase for the art concepts and graphics and special F/X. Like why does the Captain's room have no walls? It's just a bunch of lights and LEDs against the backdrop of space and stars.  Also, the music is not that great, nothing to do back-flips over.\\n\r\nThe story makes no sense, it's all a bunch of mysticism and interplanetary mumbu-jumbo that doesn't make sense to anyone outside the anime and they do a terrible job relaying it to the viewer....so there's no connection there either!\\n\\n\r\nI'm a character driven person and this show did nothing for me, the characters were trite and clich\u00e9d. And you didn't get to really see them much at all except when they're delivering all these monologues and soliloquies about legends and Golden Tribes, ugh, I was so bored of it all! this show is more about giant space mecha-monsters and spaceships and planets. The character's behaviors are severely irrational and underdeveloped. OMG the silver tribe makes me want to barf! Especially the little silver girl/monster, one minute she's a cold bossy bitch then suddenly she goes ballistic for no apparent or tangible reason and practically destroys the \"universe\" [ugh, why must everything be on such a grand scale.....so unnecessary!] but then in the next moment she's crying saying she so alone, like no one loves her [COULD it be because you're a bitch, honey?]. Actually the whole the silver tribe is like this. They're supposedly this cold and \u201clogical\u201d people but somehow these emotions are popping up left and right, WTF! The blond princess with the constant crying also gets on my nerves yet ironically she never shod one tear when her both her brothers supposedly got fried. \\n\r\nWhat a boring anime, a lot of fancy F/X and cute character's but the story is a hot-ass mess. I was severely disappointed.",

            "content": "Heroic Age is truly an extraordinary anime. For me it is a must see series.\r\nStory : 9\r\nThough the story may seem a bit classical for those of us who are fans of the sci-fi genre I want to assure you that it is non the less amazing. Yes it is the classic battle between humanity and the alien forces and yes there are heroes/champions for each of the warring factions but despite these cliched details the story is so much more. It is an extraordinary tale that depicts an awe inspiring journey of Age and the Princess towards the future not for the human raceor the Nodos or the other races but for the universe as whole. It kind of reminds me of the journey of Odysseus, the Greek hero who traveled the seas and encountered numerous perils and obstacles in his journey home and towards peace. I can keep going but I could never do justice to the story. In my humble opinion this an epic story filled with action, intrigue, chaos and dozens of feelings.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is another outstanding feature of this series. Though the art is not high class and edgy like newer anime series (Gundam 00, Code Geass, Tengen Toppa etc) it is truly remarkable. It gives off a vibe of older series that were created during the 80'2 and 90's. While watching Heroic Age I was constantly reminded of such series as Space battleship Yamato 2199, Captain Harlock, Gundam Wing etc. of course I do not claim that the art is the same as it was for these older series but that it just gives off a similar vibe. The artists managed to combine to very different art styles into one and the result is truly amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was pretty good. The opening and ending songs were well suited for this type of series and they managed to hook the viewer into watching them. The rest of the music throughout the series was very good as well. Each music piece complimented the scenes depicted. Music in this series managed to compliment the story telling and allowed the viewer to receive the anguish, sorrow, determination, joy etc of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 9\\n\\n\r\nEach of the main characters was written quite brilliantly. I, as a viewer, was able to follow the actions of our characters very easily. In essence all characters made sense. There was no part that confused me. Of course there were times were I disagreed and even cursed towards my screen but I think overall this fact made the characters more human and more believable. The one small issue I had with the character development is that certain things that occurred in the past were lost in a sense but to explain further I would have to spoil you. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall : 10\\n\\n\r\nOf course this series deserves a 10 +. This series has been extremely enjoyable and intriguing. There have few other series that I have enjoyed so much. everything about it was top notch. It is very rare for this level of quality work to be produced. To not see this series is to have missed something exceptional.",

The Gold Race set at a call to all intelligent races to enter space. There's the human race, known as the Iron Race, the Silver Race, the Heroic Race, and the Bronze Race anwser the call. Time passes and the Gold Race as left for another universe. The Heroic Race has disappeared. The Silver Race has taken power, with the help of the Bronze Race. In order to save the human race princess Deianeira travels to the far distant galaxy fortheir savior of the prophecies. They find a boy named Age who could help bring the human race to power.\\n\\n\r\nI really started out liking this anime, in one of my earlier blogs I even thought I would give it a 8, 9, or 10. Boy was I wrong, and disappointed in Heroic Age. Lets go over the things that are wrong with this anime. First the overall story started out with a good premise, but quickly became convoluted and incoherent. Than there's the one dimensional characters that have no depth to them. Finally there's the animation and battles. Both reminded me of Gundam Seed/Destiny, the more I watched. I swear the animation looks exactly like Gundam Seed/Destiny even though it's animated by different companies. I thought I was watching Gundam Seed/Destiny as I watched the battles. They were overblown big time, and ridiculous. Heroic Age had potential to be great, but let things go down hill fast.",

            "content": "Important: Forgive my english please. As a french person it's always very easy for me.\r\nI watch this serie by pure random choice on animeultima.com. I was searching for a sci-fi show and I notice that the art character were done by Hisashi Hirai, who's one of my favorite character designer. So I watch the show without understanding a lot of things at the beginning and it turns out to be one of the greatest sci-fi show I ever watch ( including anime and real tv serie/movie).\r\nStory: I'm not going to describe the story (after all, you read the synopsis, don't you?). The story began withan easy clich\u00e9: the only human raised by the golden race is the saviour of humanity, because he is the most powerfull of the five Nodos (space godzilla... just kidding). But I dindn't mind this clich\u00e9. The story follows a path of originality that I like. My only little complain: the Nodos are pretty much invicible and uber-powerfull. At least, there's a good reason why there are like this. Some people complain about this show for being to slow for his first half. I know this is not the most fast-paced action you can get, but it's a built up for an extremely good ending.\\n\r\nStory: For it's originality, despite some \"slow moments\", 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: A lot of ships were pretty well designed. The Argonaut is an awesome ship, the Silver Race have weird design, but I don't understand their bridge at all. The Bronze Race are some zerg caterpillars with acid attack. Although the ships can be more colored (silver, green and silver again), I  can't bring myself to hate this design.\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: One word: EARGASM!! An absolutely amazing soundtrack. The opening made by Angela (soukyuu no fafner, asura cryin') is an outstanding one. The ending is really cool. The soundtrack is a kickass one. If you have the chance to watch this show on a surronded system your gonna cry in joy. I tried it, it's totaly awesome.\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: An interresting cast with some \"dicks\" ( Dhianeila's brothers). Age is amusing for the most part, ignoring what's number, but understand every single words that Dhianeila tells him. Some people complain (again?!) about Age and Dhianeila for being almost \"perfect\" character. I can understand Age (although I don't agree), but I can't understand Dhianeila. She's not perfect, she just know when to take the right decision like a wise and old           captain (just kidding). I'll just say that this show needed a little bit more of background about his cast. The design of the characters is very good, but I think Hisashi Hirai need to put just a little bit of originality in his creations. Even so, I like his way of drawning.\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: I had a lot of fun watching this show. I was always looking forward to the next episode and I was never disappointed. The first half let you know what's going on and the second half kicks out with those big confrontations of flleet battles. An absolute fun watch!!\\n\r\nEnjoyement: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I don't understand why this show is so unknow to the anime public. You should try this show and then judge it. Of course, you need to like a little bit the sci-fi universe, but I can recommand this show to everyone. Just watch it and judge it. For me, it was an amazing discovery in this anime world.\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10",

            "content": "The anime is a futuristic anime where there are serveral races each trying to reach the same goal which is to become master of the galaxy after the dolden tribe left. The tale revolves around a ship of the iron tribe(humans) and their journey through war fighting and discovery.\r\nThe story is quite different from your usual futuristic anime, somethings like gundam  where you get several different parties fighting in a war. And the ultimate weapons instead of gundams are the heroic tribe which are people who can turn into big fighting robots. Though there is a dabble of fate and destiny in the storyi found it quite touching. There is a bit of romance which is only evident late in the anime, so don't expect much from romance in this anime. But it is quite a good story nonetheless with a deep meaning.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is quite similar to thatd of gundam seed you could say the main female lead looks like lacus clyne in gundam seed. I find this style of anime quite to my liking and there are no flaws in the anime,the scenaries are done up quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThe songs of the anime are quite good. I was especially entranced by the ending song Azurite, which was an insert song in certain episodes, this really brought out the mood of the setting and it was very sentimental and touching, the insert songs were done up quite well so i applaud the studio for their effort.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have some depth and carry a lot of meaning in their words and actions. The story focuses a lot of the main characters and the supporting characters are not so important. Morality is a a question that many of the characters think of and then theres the theme of fate and destiny and how the characters react to them. In the end, the characters each have thier roles to play to create a new path.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime because of the meaning that was portrayed in the anime. The fight scenes were also quite extravagant and i found it quite touching so it was generally quite entertaining, Though not the best since im a drama-romance fan, though there is a good deal of drama in this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i think the anime is worth watching, if you like action and adventure you will like this, the anime is not so much a mecha show though,so mecha fans should not have too high hopes for this.",

VERY light humor sets a realistic feeling tone and travel through space makes it feel like problems are only a step away, seeing as everybody travels in the same space ship.\r\nThe actual parts and details of the story differthough. Let's break this down:\\n\\n\r\n1) Action-\\n\r\nFight scenes all have their own luster with a uniform style. Each scenario has some crucial detail that gives a fight it's own essence.\\n\\n\r\n2) Humor-\\n\r\nThe very short scenes are heavily outweighed by the drama so their abilities to reach you are easily outweighed. But I have to admit there are very rare moments where you will laugh.\\n\\n\r\n3) Romance-\\n\r\nSurprisingly, it is really good, but you have to step back after finishing the series to really appreciate it. Yeah, if you pay attention you would notice the cliff hanging love suspense, but it can be easily confused for drama.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10; I don' t recommend this to everybody though, stick to your preferred dramas if you don't like those \"traveling\" animes. The story here is really reminiscent of Gundam Seed/Destiny if you know what I mean.",

            "content": "Space... It was once considered by the people of Earth to be the final frontier. A boundless, infinite universe stood just beyond the reaches of our ever advancing technology. We expected there to be life out there in the universe, but we had no way of knowing that by leaving the comfort of our blue planet, we\u2019d be setting foot into a game of celestial thrones that was already eons in the making. As we entered this conflict, forced into the struggle for galactic dominance, we were dubbed the iron tribe. But with the regal albinos of the Silver tribe and the larvae-looking Bronze tribeteaming up against us, we were faced with the inevitability of not just defeat... But extinction.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, until one fateful day when Dhianeilla, the princess of the human race, and the crew of her space ship The Argonaut stumbled across a half-destroyed planet, inhabited predominately by terrestrial squids. Living amongst the squids, they found a childlike young man; Savage in appearance yet kind of heart, his name was Age, and he alone possessed the ability to defend us against the worst that our enemies could dish out. But will this curious young savior be enough? Is he strong enough to bring about an end to this horrible war? Is he heroic enough to do so with as little bloodshed as possible? Or will he fail, dooming us to obscurity? One thing is certain: Without Age, this frontier truly will be our final one.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Xebec is a name that I\u2019ve often heard spoken in painful, frustrated tones by many different reviewers. And hey, it\u2019s time to add my name to that list. If animation studios were being sold in the supermarket, Xebec would be the store-brand option... I\u2019m talking Great Value levels of cheapness. They\u2019re the same company that produced Love Hina and the first Negima series, and the 2D animation in Heroic Age is a slight improvement over those works, with much better use of coloring, but as far as basic animation goes, this is pretty much the same stiff, lifeless crap that we\u2019ve become used to seeing from them.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, I\u2019m still going to give credit where credit is due. The animation looks awful whenever characters are on screen, or with any shots that take place on land or inside the space ships, but when we leave those setting and venture out into open space, the switch in visual quality is like night-and-day. The 3D animation in Heroic Age is nothing short of beautiful. This series came out in 2007, so the CG looks a little dated, but it still holds up really well. The spaceships themselves look awesome at all times, but what\u2019ll really catch your eye is the expansive outer-space backgrounds, which are full of life and color... Although when it\u2019s sharing screen time with the 2D characters, the styles really don\u2019t mesh well together.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the character designs go, there\u2019s very little inspiration or originality here. The silver tribe... The primary antagonists of the series... Are emotionless, so of course they all have long white hair. Yeah, if you haven\u2019t seen an anime where the villain had long white hair, then you don\u2019t watch much anime. There are several characters who appear to have had their aesthetic lifted directly out of Leiji Matsumoto\u2019s sketchbook, and thinking back, the only designs that really stand out are that of Age and a few less humanoid aliens, such as the bronze tribe and his squid friends.\\n\\n\r\nOddly enough, the one aspect of the character design that stands out in my memory is the sheer number of baffling choices that the creators made in regard to the female characters\u2019 uniforms. On the low end of the scale, you have several members of Dhianeila\u2019s crew... Including the princess herself... Who are wearing uniforms so skin-tight that you\u2019d swear they were painted on. I actually kind of wish that were the case, because otherwise, those poor girls are experiencing the most uncomfortable wedgies in human history. That, and somehow the suits indent enough to show off their belly buttons. On the high end of the scale, there are a few high-ranking female characters whose outfits were designed to have gaping, cleavage-baring holes in the front, and I would LOVE to hear the practical applications of this dress-code choice. I highly doubt they did that for the sake of sexiness or fan-service, because with Xebec\u2019s art quality, one poor character\u2019s cleavage looks more like ass-cheeks than anything else in most shots.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is your standard sci-fi fantasy fare... If you\u2019ve seen any anime like this, you\u2019ve heard soundtracks exactly like this...  But the English dub, on the other hand, is much more unique. I\u2019ve heard quite a few bad dubs from Funimation before. I\u2019ve heard them release dubs that were written poorly, directed poorly, or cast poorly. But through it all, I\u2019ve always felt that they were at least trying. No, phoned-in dubs were always more of an ADV thing than a Funimation thing. Heroic Age is the first dub I\u2019ve heard from them where it sounds like most of the people involved just didn\u2019t care.\\n\\n\r\nIn a cast full of late-2000s Funimation regulars, there are several actors who didn\u2019t have to reach very far into their bags of stock voices to find the right one for their respective characters. Monica Rial plays her usual squeaky-cheerful voice, aged up slightly for the dual roles of the twins Mail and Tail. Luci Christian raises her voice ever so slightly for the role of Dhianeila\u2019s personal attendant Aneasha, and Greg Ayres does his usual Greg Ayres thing for the meek Mehitak. Think Negi Springfield, but without the accent. Colleen Clinikenbeard plays another deep-voiced tough woman, Christopher Sabat plays what he likes to call a \u2018coffee break role,\u2019 and so on and so forth.\\n\\n\r\nVic Mignona plays a scheming antagonist, which is fun to listen to, but he barely gets any lines. The only actors who seem to have brought any genuine effort to the table are Cherami Leigh, who plays the tortured Lekty, a member of the Silver Tribe who slowly learns affection and emotion with the help of a fellow Nodos who\u2019s been tasked with protecting her... Cherami put out a compelling amount of pain through this character\u2019s development... And Brina Palencia, who gracefully dances the line between adorable mascot and helpful navigator in her role as the ship\u2019s AI system, Bee No Bee.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then you have the two main voice actors. I don\u2019t even know where to begin with this one. J Michael Tatum plays the titular character, and it\u2019s probably the only time I\u2019ve ever heard him attempt to do a high-pitched, wistful voice. Thank God for that. Every single line he utters sounds like he\u2019s making fun of Johnny Yong Bosch. Tatum generally has a very pleasant, soothing voice, and his performance as Age is proof that he should stick to that voice as often as possible.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, his female co-star is still worse. Caitlin Glass plays the role of Princess Dhianeila, and I am sorry to say this about any character voiced by her, but she will put you right the hell to sleep. She gives monotone a new meaning with her soft-voiced, droning delivery. She sounds like a lazy LOTR-style opening narration, which makes it even more grating to the attention span when she doles out exposition about long-winded prophecies or soliloquies about Age's feelings.\\n\\n\r\nTogether, these two voice actors turn the series into a boring, dull slog that\u2019s often a chore to watch. They have absolutely no chemistry, which is insane because... And I can\u2019t stress this enough... They\u2019re the voice actors for Isaac and Miria in Baccano. Yeah, these two one-note windbags are directly linked to the most electrifying and entertaining couple in anime history. This is the only thing that ever surprised me about this series. The Japanese actors for both characters are far superior, able to hit the same basic tones while showing so much more personality in the process.\\n\\n\r\nThe show had a whole slew of people working on the adaptive writing, and yes, it feels it. There were several different writers and ADR directors taking turns like a revolving door, and out of the three script writers attached to the project, two of them were actually good. I\u2019ve always known Monica Rial to be a talented writer, and she\u2019s always been able to adapt material in such a way that it\u2019s accessible without losing it\u2019s intent or meaning. I\u2019m new to Brandon Potter, but he did a decent job as well.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s when we talk about the third writer... J Michael Tatum... That we run into some serious problems. He\u2019s a generally well-liked actor, and rightfully so... But when it comes to scripting a dub, he\u2019s become notorious for over-writing. My least favorite kind of writers are the ones who think they\u2019re better than the material, and take every possible opportunity to make themselves look like the cleverest person in the room, which Tatum does by replacing subtle and in-character dialogue with over-used cliches, purple prose, and bizarrely out-of-place idioms that make a mockery of the text while, in some cases, changing the intent of it all together.\\n\\n\r\nHere, I\u2019ll give you an example from episode sixteen. At one point, one of Age\u2019s enemies is defeated, and brought onto the Argonaut. When confronting Age, he expresses reluctance to the idea of fighting him again, and is relieved when he hears that they don\u2019t have to. This makes sense in character, because this guy\u2019s always been pacifistic throughout the story, and the idea of engaging in an all out brawl with Age in the middle of a populated spaceship will cause countless casualties. But in the dub, Tatun changes his line to \u201cSo, you\u2019re not going to hurt me?\u201d Down-grading it from a sentiment of compassion to a sentiment of selfish cowardice. And yes, there are worse examples in here. Definitely stick to the subtitles on this one.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve been putting off reviewing this series for a few years now... No exaggeration there, I\u2019m dead serious... And in that time, it\u2019s always been floating over my head as something I would have to tackle eventually. But there were two problems. The first one was that I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d be able to watch it all the way through a second time. And the second was that, as many problems as I have with it, I had no idea how I was going to present my biggest problems with this series. So now that the time has finally come, I think I\u2019m going to start with the problem that I like to bring up whenever someone asks me why I didn\u2019t like this series... Let\u2019s talk about the title character.\\n\\n\r\nAge is a kind-hearted, childish savage who\u2019s not human by birth. He\u2019s one of the last surviving remnants of a tyrannical race of warriors that were almost completely wiped out by a more powerful force. He\u2019s picked up by a crew consisting of mostly humans, and a lot of quirky hijinks ensue as a result of their many differences. It\u2019s eventually revealed that he has the ability to transform into a giant, ferocious monster with it\u2019s own name that\u2019s unique to his, and he has to fight the other few remnants of his species if he wants to protect the human race from extinction. In other words, he\u2019s Goku. Yup. Just Goku. He doesn\u2019t have the personality, depth, or charm of Goku, but when you get right down to it, he was ripped wholesale out of the DBZ universe.\\n\\n\r\nNow, is unoriginality a bad thing? Not necessarily. Bleach ripped it\u2019s initial premise straight out of Yuyu Hakusho, and I actually like the first three seasons of Bleach MORE than it\u2019s predecessor. But then you have my next problem... Heroic Age is really stupid. This show knows about as much about outer space physics as I did in elementary school. There are plenty of rules you\u2019re allowed to break in science fiction... Sound and color don\u2019t exist in space, but very few Sci-fis care about that. Heroic Age breaks the rules you\u2019re allowed to break, as well as the ones you aren\u2019t. Not only do many of the characters move through open space as though they were swimming under-water, but in episode two, we see the main character digging a hole through the hull of the Argonaut in order to attack the villains waiting outside.\\n\\n\r\nHey, do you remember Jason X, the Friday the 13th movie where Jason Voorhies kills a bunch of people in outer space? Pretty cool, huh? One of the characters was killed when Jason broke a hole in the hull from outside, and she was sucked through that hole. That was the dumbest movie in an entire franchise of dumb movies, but even THAT story knew that when you compromise the hull of a space ship, shit goes terribly wrong. Also, I get that Age and the other Nodos can breathe in space, but an inhuman biology doesn\u2019t explain outer space wind blowing through their hair. Someone had to animate that.\\n\\n\r\nBut much like unoriginality, stupidity is not a deal breaker. There are plenty of shows that were awesome, despite having the IQ of mayonnaise, but they usually offer up some redeeming qualities to make up for it. Gurren Lagann is stupid, but it has so much energy and confidence that you just can\u2019t help but believe in it. Knights of Sidonia is incredibly stupid... Probably even more so than Age, now that I think about it... But it\u2019s so creative and sincere that it honestly just comes off as fun and adorable. Heroic Age doesn\u2019t have anything like that. In fact, rather than making up for it\u2019s stupidity, it compounds that problem with it\u2019s insistence on looking smarter and deeper than it actually is.\\n\\n\r\nAt the start of this review, I gave a heavily simplified(and not 100% accurate) plot summary of this series. What I left out was all the over-complicated pulp. Heroic Age goes up it\u2019s own ass to establish a long-winded and often self-contradictory lore about the many tribes vying for control of the universe, which never serves as anything other than an explanation for the setting. There are scattered references to Greek mythology, namely to the five ages of man, but these references are in name alone, and the tribes named after them have little to nothing to do with the ages they correspond to. The only reason Age is a descendant of the Heroic Age is because the creators wanted to emphasize how heroic HE was, never mind the fact that they\u2019re also comparing a brutal race of murderers to one of the most noble ages of the five. The tribes could just have easily been named after different ice cream brands, with the show being called Haagen-Daas Age, and it would have had just as much depth to it.\\n\\n\r\nBut is pretending to have depth or meaning a deal breaker? Not on it\u2019s own, but I\u2019m sorry, \u2018stupid\u2019 and \u2018pretentious\u2019 are not good bed-fellows. This show would have been a lot easier to watch if it had dropped all attempts at undeserved profundity, and had just told the simple story that I mentioned earlier... Only it wouldn\u2019t, because of this series\u2019 final, and biggest, problem. Heroic Age, at it\u2019s core, is just very badly written.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a ton of characters floating around in it, but Age is the only one who even gets the slightest hint of a backstory, and not one of them have any complex motivations. The two main characters... Age and Dhianeilla... have no personality outside of the fact that they\u2019re good people who are always right about everything, and everyone else just exists to support or oppose them. I\u2019ve seen this show twice, and I cannot describe a single one of it\u2019s characters with anything more than a two-sentence explanation of what they are and who they\u2019re connected to.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it apparently isn\u2019t enough that I don\u2019t feel invested in any of the characters... I can\u2019t even enjoy the action of these epic space battles because of how muddled and poorly edited these multi-episode set pieces are. You\u2019ll notice quickly that during these long battles, there is a LOT going on, at many different locations, involving many different characters, often at different times. You\u2019ll get a few seconds of Age fighting his brethren, followed by a cut to Princess Expositia explaining to us what he\u2019s going through, followed by a cut to the political squabble involving her scheming brothers, to a cut to the other Nodos\u2019 loitering around and discussing their lot in life, to a conversation someone had with Age earlier, and by the time they finally cut back to Age\u2019s fight in current time, I\u2019ve all but forgotten what he was doing there in the first place, which is the final nail in the coffin for a series I had to struggle to care about.\\n\\n\r\nHerioic Age is available from Funimation. The old releases are still available in relatively affordable halves, but you can get a much better deal by going with the SAVE release, which you can find pretty much anywhere for between fifteen and twenty dollars. The manga, which released it\u2019s first volume during the initial run of the series, is pretty much the same story told from another character\u2019s perspective, and it\u2019s not available in the states.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t like Heroic Age. I also don\u2019t hate Heroic Age. Hell, I don\u2019t anything Heroic Age. I gained nothing from this series, and in exchange, I lost way too much time on a series that I\u2019m going to forget in less than a week. It\u2019s biggest crime isn\u2019t the fact that it\u2019s stupid, pretentious, badly animated, or generic. It\u2019s biggest crime is that it\u2019s boring. I can stare at the screen for several episodes in a row, with no distractions, and I still have to constantly rewind to pick up on what the hell I missed in regard to what\u2019s happening. I\u2019m glad to finally put this turkey behind me, and I look forward to forgetting it exists. I give Heroic Age a 3/10.",

            "content": "Story\r\nRight of the bat \"Heroic Age\" seeems like any other space opera. However, it has arich story that derives many of its elements from Greek mythology, ecspecially Hercules. The plot itself has enough twists, turns, and tragedy to keep the audience wanting more, after the initial start-up period of about ten episodes. Yes, that's right, it has a slow start. A VERY slow start. Regardless, once it gets going it is hard to stop watching, unless you're Jupiter (inside joke). I can honestly say it is one of the msot clever loose adaptions I have ever seen.\r\nArt\r\n\"Heroic Age\" incorporates so much CGI into their animationtat sometimes it's hard to tell what is handdrawn. Usually, I would disdain from this practice but this time around I didn't mind it so much. It may just be because I am growing weary of arguing for handdrawn and against CG. The character desgins and other 2D aspects of it are done well, some characters are pretty generic but others really stay with you: Age, Mehitaka, ect. Also, the Heroic Race's mech desgins (though they are technically not mechs) are some of the most original and I must say, BADASS, desgins I have ever seen. Bellecross, ecspecially.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nNothing special sound wise. The opening theme is good, catchy even, but not really memorable. Any background music suits the show but isn't a draw. Voice acting is good, they really had a talented group of actors. Yui Ishikawa did a wonderful job with Princess Dhianeila.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nWhat I really like about \"Heroic Age\" is that, like many Miyazaki films, it is devoid of any true villians. There are people who do villionous things (Rome Ro, Dhianeila's elder Brothers) but everyone are really just people with their own agendas. All the characters feel as if they are acting int hte best interest of their people, no one is out to destroy the world.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, \"Heroic Age\" is a wonderful series. It does has a slow start and has sort of an acquired sci-fi taste. It isn't for everyone, I would reccomend ir more to sci-fi fans more than traditional anime fans. However, if space operas are your thing, than this show is for you.",

            "content": "Okay, so after watching so many mecha, fantasy, action animes. I have never ever felt so satisfied when it comes to a story like this one. I am lucky and blessed to stumble upon such a beautiful masterpiece.\r\nThe story is somewhat intriguing, it makes you wanna fall at the edge of your seat as you anticipate every episode, fearing for what will happen next.\r\nThe story is based upon the threat of extinction of all humankind along with the struggles of political, military, space, survival and superpowers (Planetary Destruction kind of power).\r\nThree superior races, the silver tribe and the bronze tribe along with the relics ofthe all powerful heroic tribe, who was forced to serve inferior beings as a punishment due to their wild behavior by the golden tribe, converge against such a newly primitive race (humankind/iron tribe) thus forcing the humans to leave earth to search for a new hope on far away galaxies. To prevent such demise, a princess took the call to search for the one who has been prophesied by an ancient race (the golden tribe) a 120 years ago before leaving. He is said to be the one who will save all humanity carrying a huge burden along with his 12 labors that must be done no matter what at all costs. But against all odds, political and other entities that threats their very existence, they all persevere towards the end. Kodus to such a very well laid story, i really appreciate it. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the anime does not say any romance in it, but actually, it does, it has some cute moments. The ending is beautiful and i like to think that it is just the begining. I am really hoping for a second season.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are quite interesting, the art is not that beautiful and lovely but the animation sure does makes me wanna see more action.\\n\\n\r\nSo that is all i have to say, this anime now belongs to one of my favorites, a 10/10.\\n",

            "content": "~Story~\r\n One word: Unique! I havent seen a anime anything like this, sure theres alot of space,save the planet type animes but this one took that basic idea and came up with a amazing version. The basics may be the same but the rest was unique to this anime. The anime itself got straight to the point, within the first episode you understood a bit of what this anime was going to be like. The anime was an all around amazing achievment in a sworm of clique anime's it certainly stood out.\r\n~Art~\r\n I can't say this was the best are because it wasnt, it wasamazing but sometimes the battle scenes when the two people clashed it was a little hard to make out but only once or twice so other than that it was an amazing mix of 2D and 3D! \\n\r\n~Sound~\\n\r\n The music for the anime was...not great, it was a little repetitive but the sound effects for the anime itself was spot on and if you were on a space ship getting attacked this is certainly what i imagine it would sound like. \\n\r\n~Character~\\n\r\n Now, All the characters were unique in their own way. Instead of a big macho or cool and collected main male role the male was like a new born child in the begining and you could see him grow, guess thats what happens when your stuck alone on a planet for god knows how many years and have never learned the basics. Hes refered to as a monkey alot, i loved him. The rest of the characters were a little shallow but were amazinly well developed. The only characters that annoyed me were the Princess's two brothers, i was hoping they would die the whole time. \\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\r\n A-M-A-Z-I-N-G The anime was fabulous to watch and kept you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The characters were badass icons that will be remembered forever for their awesome display of the future of anime. \\n\r\n~Overall~\\n\r\n Overall i would give it a 9/10, the only reason i dont give it a 10 is because the ending didnt explain much but its the only way it could have ended. I still adored the ending though, adorably awesome. Anyway so if you love Anime of any kind i suggest you watch this anime due to its amazing graphics,unique plot, Incedible characters, beautiful art and one hell of a fan base!",

See for your self,if you dont belive me!\r\nThe story's theme is based on stories in Greek mythology, especially those surrounding Heracles, upon whom the main character is based, and his Twelve Labors. Story line never gets sluggish. How could it get,because theres a lot to be told in only 26 episodes! Intro song is done by Angela,and its superb for this series. I love it!\r\nLong time after an advanced race, theGolden Tribe, left to explore other universes, the human race, known as the Iron Tribe, became threatened with extinction.\\n\r\n Since the Golden Tribe left, the Silver Tribe has long been the most dominant race, calling themselves the Golden Tribe's successors. The young princess of the Iron Tribe, Dianeira, searches for the one mentioned in her family's history; the messianic individual that holds the power to save her people. \\n\r\nThis person she looks for is the only human to have been raised by the Golden Tribe before they departed from the universe. After her ship and crew reaches the ruined planet, Oron, which holds the one she is looking for, they are attacked by the Bronze Tribe.

It has action, wonderful story, war, Mecha, and a breathtaking soundtrack.\r\nThe storyline is similar to other animes out there. But why I like it, is because the hero is not the guy who is always caught up in annoying triangles; Like \"who should I join? I am so confuse? who is the good guy? who is the bad guy?\" The hero in this anime, knows his mission and knows what he is supposed to do. It's a very straight forward anime, and it always teases you at the end, making you want to watch the nextepisode.\\n\\n\r\nI like animes with a good soundtrack, and this anime it perfect. It has this orchestra theme in every episode that always sends chills running through your spines. I also like the opening and ending theme song as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe character design may not interest some people, but trust me just watch this anime. You'll learn the accept it, just like me.\\n\\n\r\nI like this anime, I have been watching animes since the early 90's. So I am sometimes picky when it comes to watching good animes. This anime is one of a kind. \\n\\n\r\nenjoy watching this anime.",

            "content": "Heroic Age is a good anime, full of awesome space battles, giant Mech-like monsters that battle over the fate of the galaxy, and a sense of survival as the entire human race is losing a war that will lead to its extinction.\r\nThe battles themselves are one of the reasons I am draw to this anime as much as I am. Every battle is big with an enormous amount of human soldiers, ships, and alien species. As the series progresses the battles get bigger, more impressive and much more destructive. Personally I feel like based on the battles alone I feel like this anime is worthat least checking out. Also while this is considered a Mecha in some regards, its done in a much similar way it is done in Code Geass, where the Mechs are just this anime's version of a super soldier and are just as destructible as anything else is, which I feel is much more exciting.\\n\r\nThe characters in the series are nothing too special, and are none too unique, but there are a few characters that you will get attached to and that's when the series picks up, because then it matters to you if they die. \\n\r\nAs far as music goes, the only song of interest is the opening which is very good, but not so much so that it worthy of extra special note (other than this one of course) but nonetheless is a catchy tune and you will find yourself listening to it out of choice at the beginning of each episode.\\n\r\nOverall, the story and characters are nothing new but are done well so while you have a good idea how the series will end, the journey itself is the most enjoyable part. I'd recommend this anime simply based on the battles alone, they are so big and impressive that they (with good reason) take center stage. If you have the time and are in the mood for an epic space survival full of large scale battle, give this one a try, because personally I never get tired of it.\\n",

            "content": "Had I seen it earlier in my anime career, I have a hunch that Heroic Age could have become one of my favorite series. For starters, my very favorite--Busou Renkin--was produced by the same studio Xebec just a year before, and the similarities in animation style seem pretty obvious to me. While today I find any and everything to nitpick, my younger self might have been enchanted by the grand scope and simplistic characters. Sadly, I think Heroic Age may be widely misunderstood by both viewers and potential viewers, which is a shame because behind the confusion surrounding its premise and backstory lies a wholesomestory about an innocent boy who wants to make a better life for his friends. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall look of Heroic Age is not too shabby. The character designs are charming, if a bit bland, but I can't say that the Argonaut crew costumes do much for me. It's a shame that this series isn't about the mechs, because they look pretty sick. The main combatants--the Nodos--are strikingly intimidating, with their otherworldly organic features. The animation quality is pretty consistent, and I don't think there were any glaring drops in animation quality. The Nodos fight scenes are all at least decently animated, even if they did foolishly abandon the stock footage for Age's transformation early on. Putting it side by side with Busou Renkin I can definitely tell they're produced by the same studio. However, I think Heroic Age does a better job of keeping characters on model.\\n\\n\r\nIt should be no surprise that Studio Xebec employed all of its 3DCG resources for this series, and the show benefits greatly from it. The large amount of space ships and laser battles look solid and consistent in 3D. There are a few instances of the worm-type enemies being rendered in 3D which look kind of awkward, but they're few and far between. There's a striking 3D attack animation which starts to show up in the final act of the story, and it makes it look every bit as terrifying as it's supposed to be. In general most of the digital effects were expertly implemented, which is what I've come to expect from Xebec.\\n\\n\r\nI can't find as much to say about the sound in Heroic Age because I didn't find it all that engaging. Some of the Nodos sound downright bone chilling, with monstrous, otherworldly roars that can of course be heard all across outer space. The soundtrack is somewhat middle of the road. Many of the slower, emotional tracks are pretty powerful, but most of the battle themes and miscellaneous scores just fall flat for me. The opening theme has an energetic blend of genres that I find undeniably infectious, but the slower ending theme doesn't hold my attention very long. In Japanese, the voice cast is solid, but none of the performances really felt outstanding. I only bothered to watch one episode in English, which failed to captivate me.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Heroic Age is perhaps it's most well developed aspect, as well as that which may confound most viewers. The jist of it is not too hard to comprehend, but it's always hinted at in the least revealing manner possible. Characters will prattle on about the advanced ancient races of the universe as if everyone understands--which in that universe they mostly do, but we as the audience do not. Even though a friend of mine had given me the rundown of the lore before I ever started watching, I still felt a bit confused at times. This leads to a lot of what feels like wasted screen time early on that could have been used for more character development or straightforward exposition.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is pretty decent, seeing our main characters aboard the Argonaut amass an army and lead a harrowing campaign across the galaxy. On both sides of the mid-climax the pacing feels a bit slow, but it picks back up. A few allegiances shift towards the end, but it's not an abrupt or unwelcome shift. The finale was sweet and satisfying, and gave me some heavy Gurren Lagann vibes. Something of note to the critical thinkers who watch this: When you have characters like the Nodos who can destroy planets with a sneeze there arise some... Not quite plot holes, but unsound war strategies to nitpick. I can't really get into those without spoilers, so I'll leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Heroic Age are not all terribly developed or complex, but for the most part they're not annoying. It does a good job of building up the Argonaut crew and their friendship with Age early on, so much so that when they lost some screen time around the middle I genuinely missed them!  A couple of the Nodos characters are a bit flat and nondescript and the Silver Tribe are not really characters, but I think their tribe is pretty interesting as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nSo who should watch Heroic Age? I would say give it a try if you're ready for some cute character friendships, insanely large scale fleet battles, planet shattering punches, and a backstory that may be difficult to decipher, but is not totally necessary to enjoy the action.",

            "content": "After finishing this series, I must say that this is not your standard space opera anime with millions of spaceships aimlessly firing at each other to no end, even though it\u2019s still a military series. The content provided was so engaging, that it comprehensively ensured that it made itself clear in what it was trying to achieve, which is shown in the penultimate conclusion that may be questionable to some. The unexpected mystery elements added to the plot was intriguing to the viewer, as it constantly allowed us to internally ask questions which in hindsight, were not that difficult to answer as the story progressed.\r\nStory-\\n\\n\r\nTo summarise, the anime mainly revolves around an inter-tribal conflict that is occurring in the universe ever since the departure of the Tribe of Gold (ToG) who were the predominantly key figures in the past. The Tribe of Silver (ToS), in the absence of ToG have declared they would claim the entire universe for themselves, presumably as an act of responsibility as they are the most technologically advanced. The ToS and the Tribe of Bronze are seen trying to eliminate the Tribe of Iron (aka humankind), as they are seen as being detrimental to their goals who pose of a great threat.\\n\\n\r\nAn expedition force led by humanity\u2019s representative, Dhianeila, travels to the deserted and ruined planet Olone in search for the saviour mentioned by the ToG. The 5th Nodos named Age, has the 12 agreements mentioned by the ToG to fulfil for humankind in an attempt to bring back stability to the universe, by retaliating against the ToS\u2019s aggression. The acquisition of Age mainly sees him encountering the other Nodos (each with their own agreements as well) who are beings that possess extraordinary powers (transforming to alien-mechs) that are immune to standard attacks. In other words, they are basically the trump card that can effectively decide the outcome of the battle(s). The game changer is when a certain conclusion is made after thorough analysis that signals an end to the situation at hand.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were numerous to say the least but my biggest gripe would be was that there wasn\u2019t that much depth to them besides the main protagonist duo of Age and Dhianeila who play a pivotal role. One thing I very much enjoyed about this show, was the different angles explored when deciding the motives of certain individuals with clear emphasis placed on the Nodos and their importance. The opposition Nodos who are seen forced to fight for the ToS had dire circumstances, which is seen through the blackmail created from the exploitation of their agreements.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters on the side of humankind mainly consisted of experienced military personnel who have sworn absolute loyalty to the princess Dhianeila. People like Iolaous and his family were interesting to watch however they were mainly insignificant and played only a bit-part role in support. Dhianeila\u2019s brothers who are supposedly first rate politicians were amusing as they were comical for majority of time especially every whenever they failed as a military commander. On the opposite side of the spectrum were the leaders of the ToS, namely the O family governed by Prome and Prathe with Rom Rar being an advisor. This group looked monotone from first glance but after cutting off emotions as per custom made it seem like they could make rational decisions, which wasn\u2019t the case as emotions spilled over in the heat of things.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound\\n\\n\r\nNow being made in 2007, the animation quality by Xebec was average at best compared to other series during that time period. The character designs were simple and ordinary to say the least, so no complexity there. CGI is a common thing for a series that is a space opera and is heavily reliant on mechs which at times can be fine in moderation but when used extensively could backfire in a sense. As I mentioned earlier, the battlefield in space was so clustered with the weapons being fired in random arrays that is seemed like friendly fire was bound to happen, however nothing of that sort came to fruition to my disappointment. The Nodos transformations were appealing to me as I genuinely believe there was great effort put into their designs and abilities which can get crazy at times. This is a series that just takes a few episodes to get running and past that you wouldn\u2019t even notice the art as being important.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was arguably the weakest aspect for me as there was a lack of good tracks to listen to, with them mostly being in the high tension moments or for emotional impact. The voice acting was adequate for the characters\u2019 roles with there being no major abnormalities from what I\u2019ve witnessed. If there a positive point to come out of this discussion, then I would say the opening was quite nice with good vocals. It really gives off an immediate impression of the overall themes that is evident when linking with other important events.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThere was one quote that was special to me and that was when Age spoke to Dhianeila.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll create a path for you, so go straight down the path you want to take.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThis had a great impact on me personally as I believe it was referenced countless times and was highlighted through some great symbolism in the end where it all mattered. Heroic Age taught me that even through turbulent times, there is still light at the end of the tunnel so one must not lose hope even in the face of adversity. A very well planned out series with good attention to plot details and I would highly recommend this for someone looking for a good space opera.\\n",

            "content": "Plot\r\nThe plot was really well made; everything was well detailed and nothing was left in question by the end of the anime. To me this was much better than the mainstream shounen (Naruto, Bleach, etc) because it had a really good message.\r\nArt\r\nThe art is average, it\u2019s not super good but it\u2019s not bad either. Some people like me probably will think the art is weird thus not watching it but after reading just the summary I was into it and eventually you get a hang of it. The Heroic Race creatures were pretty cool looking too. Age's eyes are kinda creepy looking too.\r\nMusic\r\nThe OST musicwas pretty good, it made scenes more dramatic but it\u2019s very repetitive. The opening song is strange at first but by the 15th~ episode it\u2019s catchy and the lyrics fit the anime perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe characters in this show were unique, I especially liked Dhianeila, she reminded me of Lacus Clyne from Gundam SEED, The Nodos were all interesting too. I liked the development between Age and Dhianeila, it doesn\u2019t seem like Age is interested but it\u2019s still cute. I wished Dhianeila's brothers suffered or something though.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendations\\n\r\nThis was a great anime with sci-fi and mecha. I highly recommend you watch this if you liked Eureka Seven, Gundam Seed (and Destiny), Code Geass and even Zoids. If you haven't watched any of those than I also highly recommend them if you liked this anime after you finish.\\n",

The art is stunning, the sound and musical score are amongst the best. The characters are enjoyable and the story is captivating and heartfelt. This is really a beautiful series about survival and evolution. I strongly suggest you give it a chance. Right from thefirst episode you'll be hooked.",

            "content": "The Space opera genre is one of my favorites in any medium and so is mecha so this anime should have been and all time classic for me, and sadly it is not the case.\r\nFirst the story, is really broad full of stereotypes and for the most part is very predictable. There are no major twist, the characters have very specific roles in it, so you know where everything is going to go, and that makes it a chore to watch.\r\nAnimation and sound, both are fine. Nothing really spectacular, the design for the mecha is a little generic, but they move nicely during combat orother scenes. One highlight are the ships, they look distinct and fit the personality of each race.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, this is the terrible part. None of the characters have any real dimension to their personalities, they have one motivation each, and for 80% of the cast it does not change, so there is no arch for anyone, their lives move in a flat line. Specially that dam princess, who is the biggest cliche of all and I cannot really stand her at all.\\n\\n\r\nTo have a good space opera you either focus on the characters, making the world generic, or zoom to the world and make the characters just archetypes, but certainly not both. This is the case with this anime, the two parts are generic and thus boring. I would recommend to give it a pass.",

I do not think it's an anime with epic like \"Death Note\" or \"Attack on Titan.\" But I recommend it for its qualities. \r\nStarting with the protagonist, it is different than expected, is a character without many idiocies, fully aware of what to do or be. The protagonist captivates us with their sympathy and when we see, we are already halfway through the anime. \r\nWhat intrigued me was the few novels developed, it becomes obvious love, but there is no development on it to get morebattles or time for history. I left a little disappointed, but changes from your preferences. \\n\r\nThe story is simple, it makes you want to continue even if a little predictable. It at one point a good final battle, but is overcome by a well closed and well built end. Outside the union style \"Mecha\" and style \"Shonnen\" in the anime. I found it interesting. \\n\r\nWhy I recommend this anime? Simple, it's a good anime you totally\\n\r\nout of the routine, without it being by a bad anime. Most of the anime has battles, so who likes to see some punches and powers around... you can be happy. I'm just disappointed not to have a second season, OVA's or movies. It is a taste of \"I want more\" after watching. \\n\r\nIf you've read this far, you need know that i have not spoken spoilers. \"Heroic Age\" is a very good anime for those who do not want to get stuck in a style anime only.",

The only flaw is the ending but that is a common theme in anime in general.  The Japanese tend to over-think the ending of their stories in general - that is nothing new.\r\nBut aside from the ending which could have been clearer, this show will be enjoyed by people that like self-scarifying heroes, fighting, virtuous themes and purity of character.  Don't look for extensive comedy or high-schooldrama here.  The soundtrack is well done and the theme itself is quite catchy.  The main characters are thoughtfully created and stay true to their nature throughout (i.e. they are dependable).  I see it as an uplifting and grounding show in today's fast-paced, confusing world.  A reminder that the goal of life must be grander than downloading the newest apps on your beloved cell phone. \\n",

There's a sense as you watch this series that it is going to be told well -  a ripping yarn that breathes, so you can kick back and feel in good hands and take the risk of feeling for the charcters respective journey's - i liked that. I enjoyed the both the male and female qualities of heroism this anime develops.  The music guides it well.  Along the way I was reminded of Genesis Survivor Gaiarth, Detonator Orgun and other work by ARTMICalso  battlestar gallactica( the 2004 live for tv series) and Ravel's Bolero. \\n\r\nYet, by the end, this story finds  its own place. Some really nice character design, some great mecha and i particularly enjoyed the match between high concept  and  visual imagination as it moved confidently to conclusion. It manages to step up a level and  takes us with it. In the end - Joyful completion and good fun!",

It may not be original since there are quite a few space animes but i can surely say this is one of the best. \r\nStory 10/10\r\nThe story itself was clear, it had no unnecessary fillers and it left no plotholes. All the questions you could come up with were answered. The story does not tell us about how The Golden Tribe came into existence and gained tremendous power but since it revolves around The Iron Tribe and The Silver Tribe it isn't needed.\r\nThe ending was superb. I won't spoil it but i can tell you it wasa very satisfying ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art was great. It was actually better than i thought, especially the Nodoses, they looked absolutely amazing. \\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe voice acting was amazing aswell. All of the characters voices were fitting for their personalities. I especially liked Dhianeilas voice, calm and soothing, it was perfect for her. The OP was good but not memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\r\nAll of the ''villains'' had a background. They weren't there just to be there. Although different, they had their reasons to fight. The supporting characters were very important throughout the story and had tasks to fulfill to take the story forward. And this is a rarity for me but i couldn't dislike a single character in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nAlthough i can't say for sure since people are different I believe they will like this as long they have nothing against space and mechas because this is a great anime. I believe there is value in rewatching this someday even if you remember parts of it.\\n",

            "content": "/** spoiler free */\r\nHeroic Age is an entertaining sci-fi narrative that leans heavily on abstract concepts and stays tightly focused on the main events of the plot. It also has a good mix of action. Whether you are a fan of mecha combat, fights between superhumans or large scale space fleet warfare this show contains all three.\r\nThe story is one of the stronger aspects of the show IMO. Personally, I'm incredibly irritated by shows that like to pretend they have a plot that's going somewhere, but really the writers have no clue what their doing and are simply making it up as they go. Bycontrast, it's clear that Heroic Age was planned out more or less from start to finish, and as a result, the show has a very refreshing and rewarding linear progression. Despite this, it still has its flaws. Within the sci-fi universe of Heroic Age, exist many complex and abstract mechanics that interact in crucial ways with the plot. Compared to other anime that are similar in this regard, Heroic Age does a better job explaining these concepts, but the concepts themselves seem flawed at many points. In additions some of these mechanics, although properly explained are essentially just elaborate and recuring deus ex machinas. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of deus ex machinas, I'm now going to move on to the characters. Starting with the princess, who gave me the most difficulty out of all the characters. Due to certain plot points, that I am going to try and avoid discussing the specifics of, she not only has incredibly thick plot armor but passively buffs her allies with it as well. Similar to the MC of this and many other anime, she is a near-perfect character whos only flaw is that she is TOO nice at times. As for the supporting characters, I actually enjoyed many of them despite their somewhat typical anime behavior. The primary antagonists, the tribe of silver, were particularly enjoyable. I'd give the show a decent score in the character department if it wasn't for the princes and to a lesser extent the MC.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is a bit mixed for me. I enjoyed the concept behind the various 3D assets (this show is part CGI). However, once those assets began to move around I was less impressed. Frequently, a 3D or 2D asset will simply move across the screen without changing in any way. When they have the large-scale space battles it's the same but copied and pasted repeatedly. I was generally unimpressed by the fight scenes in the show as a result. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is something that I'll admit, I take far less notice of as I watch an anime. However, the score during certain parts did manage to grab my attention. I remember a particular scene where the score was this giant haunting detuned symphony that created quite a bit of tension. The sound effects didn't leave much of an impression nor did the voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough personally, I enjoy shows with a bit more focus on the characters, and with a healthy dose of subplot, the narrative of this show was enough to pull me in and hold my interest. Considering how much I've been switching between shows lately, I was certainly impressed by this show, which held me captive for all 24 episodes despite its flaws.",

            "content": "The story was well thought out, it was one of those animes which had everything planned from the beginning and almost or even every episode was story related. It could have had a bit more romance, but there was some there. It had a great ending in my opinon, everything was cleared up and it didn't just end like other animes it ended with a new adventure.\r\nThe animation was pretty good although I'm not really the one to comment on animations since I watch animations a lot.\r\nThe action was nice. Age, the main character was like super strong only 4 others stood a chance againsthim yet his fights with those 4 others were great, they last up to hundereds of hours  at most (in the anime of course). \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were good, the main character isn't one of those guys who has strength but always questions himself and has self doubt instead he just gives it his all. Princess Dhianeila is a nice character, you don't get to many animes where the main character falls for a girl like her, most go for the tsundere girl most the time. The supporting characters were all good, and I really liked how the pilot captain came to like the main character early on instead of trying to compete with him the whole time (those characters really annoy me, the ones who interfer with the main characters romance).\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was a great anime, it's probably going to be a rewatch for me in the future, I really liked it the music wasn't bad either, I liked the song on the last episode. Give it a try.",

            "content": "There are some things in life that we describe as vanilla, bland, ordinary, unremarkable. This is not a fair description of vanilla. Vanilla is often used in scents and flavors. Vanilla is sought out by many people. Vanilla has character. I would offer a more apt comparison but not many things manage to have the quality of being completely average.\r\nHeroic Age is essentially the Japanese version of The Hulk + Star Trek.The premise is somewhat cool. Teenage child capable of becoming god mech thing, protecting the last humans as they search for a home, under attack from aliens. The more you explain it the moreHeroic Age starts to sound boring and generic. Where is that thing that makes it stand out? Quick hint, It isn't there.\\n\\n\r\nHeroic Age falls flat the moment it lands thanks to one of the worst possible character sets i've ever seen. They aren't badly acted or written, they just are. The cast of Heroic age is very dull. From the script to the acting no one feels like there really there. Central to this cast is Age, the protagonist. The unaware, naive, aloof but powerful lead has been done before but they usually need strong personalities around to contrast them. Instead Heroic Age has an amorphous blob of exchangeable GI Joes and an enabling akunamatata style princess in charge of the whole shebang. Age puts humanity in serious danger on multiple occasions and is never confronted about it with any conviction. No one on humanities last ditch fleet to find earth 2.0 has any balls.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the crew isn't on screen de-saturating, we either get a series of Gundam/Macross era space battles, or dramatic irony in the form of dark space room conversations between the enemy god people. Though not appalling the battles are nothing spectacular and are severly hampered by 3D. There is a reason why top rated series that use 3D make it look hand drawn. No Fractals i can make in c4d look as nice as something a proper animator can draw. 3D works best with an enormous budget or an entire work rendered in it. Half measures don't cut it.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of half measures. The Gold Tribe punished the Heroic Tribe for causing chaos. They destroyed all but 3. Those three would each protect a remaining tibe. The gold tribe left the universe and passed their knowledge to the Silver Tribe. The Silver tribe decided to destroy the Iron Tribe with the help of the Bronze tribe. That is the back story. The most unique thing Heroic Age has to offer story wise is that the leftover heroic's got their own name, Nodos. The ship is even names the Argonaut. Nothing is unique or exciting about any of this. It's as though no one even tried to get me to care.\\n\\n\r\nI watched this back when I was naive enough to push through a series I didn't care about just because. Heroic Age is not a bad series. I have watched bad series. I watched fucking basquash! But for the life of me I cannot find a reason why i would ever recommend Heroic Age. \\n\\n\r\n-Docbrown - Otakucenter.com - Reveiw Squad",

A lot of strong characters and interesting concepts involving the interactions between the races of different planets. \r\nWhat I liked:\r\n*The art - There are a lot of beautiful depictions of the scenery of alien planets as well as alien races\r\n*Accuracy - Call me picky, but it bugs me when anime's or movies are so blatantly scientifically inaccurate. This anime goes into detail, and deals with issues like different atmospheric conditions and alternate evolution.\r\n*The characters - Aside from Mail and Tail, who I found to be kind of obnoxious, I fell in love with all of the characters, who are presentedin a way which you can understand their motives, even those of the \"bad guys\".\\n\\n\r\nWhat I disliked:\\n\r\n*Space battles - The space battles, be it between ships or Nodos, tended to drag on and on and weren't very interesting. Kind of like the earlier Star Wars, so if you're into that, this anime is definitely for you.\\n\r\n*Slow - The first couple of episodes are great, but past that they get kind of dull and slow, and entails a lot of politics and the aforementioned space battles.\\n\r\n*Time??? - I'm somewhat of a sci-fi geek, however, I got kind of lost with all the time jumps and black holes and absence of space-time and whatnot.",

            "content": "Heroic age was either the 1st or 2nd anime I watched, the other being Eureka Seven, it really got me into anime and still remains one of my fav series I have ever watched. \r\nStory - The story isn't too difficult to understand, you should understand much of it by the 2nd-3rd episode. I like really like the battles although unfortunately there is a lot of times where repeated scenes are used, specifically when you have mecha suits landing on the spaceship, the main setting of the series, called the Argonaut. The story has nice pacing, it doesn't rush one minute and then slow downthe next. \\n\\n\r\nArt - Having come out in 2007 the art is starting to show its age, but it still holds out well. The design of the characters including the alien species, the ships, etc are good and the battles are believable. As previously mentioned, there is a lot o overused scenes during the battles but mainly just mechs landing on the Argonaut, still can be a bit annoying though. \\n\\n\r\nSound - I like the music in HA, it really creates an atmosphere especially during the latter half of the season. Other than that overall, sound is average. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - I felt the characters were pretty good, I really got accustomed to Age very quickly.  I did find Dhianelia a bit unbelievable, it might be an anime but no person is ever as nice as she is. The only other problem is Dhianelia's brothers who really will pee you off but I guess they are neccesary to show that there will always be people out thier who will sacrifice anything for power and influence.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Overall, it is a very good anime that is IF you can overlook the Dhianielia's brothers that is. The battles are big, enjoyable and aren't just resolved in 1 episode. I would definitely ask people to give this a go... Oh, the brothers don't start coming into the anime until somewhere between episode 8-11, I think, I haven't watched it in a while. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

Heroic Age has the combination to make a good show: great story, lovely characters and amazing ost. \r\nFirst of all, you have to know this is not a funny or a super entertainment show, but a gorgeous one. The main purpose of this anime is simple: To tell a story. \r\nThe creators made something amazing: a completely new universe. A universe where people is different. I'm not talking about physical diferences, but mental ones. The Silvers, the ones who are always connected, who shares every moment their opinions, their experiences, their feelings. They have a different lifestyle againstthe humans, who are individual people. The contrast is wonderful. \\n\\n\r\nBut leaving that, we have to focus on the story: Some tribes that have the same aim: to obtain the Golden Tribe power. There's only one thing that makes the difference, the Nodos. Maybe this story seems to be quite simple, but the complexity and the message arrive little by little. \\n\\n\r\nThis show has only two things I disliked: The animation, whose quality is so poor, and the process, which is sometimes a little bit bored. \\n\r\nTo be honest, Heroic Age is not the best anime ever, but it has one of the beautifulest stories I have ever watched, with great issues and characters.",

It is set in a futuristic, space opera feeling and holds a lot of space travel \u201cstuff\u201d. \r\nThe very beginning of the story interested me, which is the hardest part of any anime, catching the interest of the viewer at the very first glance. It was introducing characters and background quite well, but the continuation was rather bland. Since I have to judge the story in this part I\u2019ll try to do it that way:\r\nThe first part of the anime was the best part; you can clearly feel howmuch work was put in it compared to the following ones.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the \u201cmiddle part\u201d of the anime holds some interesting parts, or should I say more original ones, many of them are rather unnecessary. \\n\\n\r\nThe last part, the conclusion, was almost as good as the first part, although predictable.\\n\\n\r\n-Art 6/10-\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very hard to judge because of some inconsistencies that are following the anime all along. First of all the animation relies a lot on computer graphics, while this should not be considered evil in itself the result is rather dull. \\n\\n\r\nA huge load of the episodes runtime is spent on showing generic starships with random orders being heard in the background, I\u2019m almost sure you could delete a third of the anime and keep the story consistent without those. You\u2019d be right to say this is needed to give the \u201cspace feeling\u201d to the audience, but the problem is that we cannot differentiate those scenes from one another, which leads us to the combat/action part.\\n\\n\r\nThe fleet action is ok, sometime better than previous battles, but at least it has the merit to be constant. It\u2019s the Nodos fights that are not that great. You get the smash into huge ball and rip the shit out of it way too often. Ok, we get it, it\u2019s powerful, maybe you\u2019d be able to show it to us in more original ways rather than making a show out of a recycling bin\u2026 Don\u2019t misunderstand, I found it hard to enjoy some of them, but I have no problem recognizing that some of the action scenes were very good and even more when compared to the previous ones.\\n\\n\r\nSo it\u2019s like this, some animation is good and some is just overused, it won\u2019t stop you from enjoying the show, I think.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound 7/10-\\n\\n\r\nI do not have a clear opinion on this point. All I can say from the experience is that the tracks are good, but I would have like to hear more since it felt like a lot of them were being used too often. It\u2019s still getting a very good score nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\n-Character 5/10 -\\n\\n\r\nThis is where I was the most disappointed. I really felt that the beginning of a \u201cviewer/character relation\u201d was there, but it did not blossom at all. The only character that the anime made me really attached to was B, the AI of the Argonaut, but it may be due to my bias towards \u201candroid, robot\u201d characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe hero is one of the best characters and yet he is far from not being flawed. To get attached to a character you need to feel its humanity, its \u201cpros and cons\u201d on a psychological level. A part of it is done well and the other is completely lost because of the \u201cperfect\u201d feeling we get from him, not unlike the Princess character.\\n\\n\r\nShe\u2019s similar to him, not a common human with unique powers and a will that nothing can shake. She was shown with more weaknesses, even if subtle, that\u2019s why I\u2019m almost thinking she was done better than Age.\\n\\n\r\nMobeedo is one of the characters we get to see the most and yet we know very little about him apart from the fact that three other characters are his children. He\u2019s not a completely failed character, but given the runtime allowed to him that\u2019s not enough.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other secondary characters with potential, the relationship between Anesha and Iolaous and the weird and joyful feel we get from the twins Mail and Tail. All of the \u201cimportant figures\u201d of the silver race and the other Nodos are interesting too. \\n\\n\r\nThe main problem is that they\u2019re all \u201cbeginnings\u201d. The character development is most likely not only the field I was most disappointed in, but the filed the anime mostly failed/lacks. If this was done correctly the anime could have gone from \u201cgood \u201c to \u201cvery good\u201d or even \u201cexcellent\u201d for some viewers.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment 7/10-\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime since I did want to know what will follow and was surprised some times. Some combat scenes got me joyed and they even managed to make me a little sad sometimes. \\n\r\nThe missing three points wouldn\u2019t have been hard to get if the character development had been done better and if a third of the episodes did not feel like fillers.\\n",

Find a fabled, prophecised hero, get him to understand his job somewhat, and then send him off into a war. Its easy to understand and follow story-wise. The characters are predictible. You'll see character development coming a mile away. The sound is a bit iffy. The art was pretty damn good. \r\nI'd have to say for you to try it out. Go ahead and test the waters. \r\nP.S. One of my first reviews, hope it helped.",

            "content": "For those of us who don't go in with their mind switched off in the hopes of enjoying some mindless entertainment, it's nearly impossible to find anything you can relate to.  You meet the cast and the one character that needed his or her face punched in is one too many.  The people behind it seem to focus too much on animation, gaining #chan lulz, or both to even care about actual and engaging plot.  And by the time it ends, you feel like you've been trolled HARDCORE.\r\nThat's my worry when I went and purchased Heroic Age.  I feared that themale lead, or anybody else who's a guy, would have his character assassinated.  I also feared that it would be the next to bandwagon off of Martian Successor Nadesico (which seemed to rely on hopeless fanboys more than itself).\\n\\n\r\nAs the late, great Billy Mays would have it; \"Not Anymore.\"\\n\\n\r\nHeroic Age is a great mixture of space battles, politics, friendship, and intrigue; it twice the level one would find in Glass Fleet.  It's like what you get after removing the sexual promiscuity and so-called \"comedy\" from Nadesico.\\n\\n\r\nThis show, thankfully, isn't to SHOUNEN or fanservicy.  And it might come off as bland, lovey-dovey, and hesitant when half of the \"bad guys\" need to be evil.  AND the question needs to be asked about Karkinos' \"Am I Cute Uugu?\" face.  But it's fun and engaging in a \"What Happens Next?\" way.\\n\\n\r\nFinally:  Points go to FUNimation for giving Colleen Clinkenbeard's \"serious older woman\" voice to the commanding pair of military knockers known as Nilval Nephew.  (Now if only FUNi can focus more of getting shows like these, as oppose to just focusing on shows with knockers in general; than they can start regaining respect as the self-proclaimed \"anime leader.\")",

I think I loved it so much because Heroic Age makes TONS of references to Greek Mythology and some of the characters are even have or have similar names to Greek Mythology characters. Heroic Age is takes place in space and is intended to be a Si-Fi anime. If you enjoy epic battles in space and Greek Mythology then I think you'll enjoy this anime.",
