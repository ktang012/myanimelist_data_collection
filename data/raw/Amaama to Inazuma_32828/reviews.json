            "content": "Looking at all the other reviews, most people are going to disagree with my opinion, but it is my opinion and I have a right to share it. \r\nI have to admit, i did enjoy the first few episodes. The most captivating part the show was Tsumugi. Her adorableness pretty much drove the show, but it could only drive it so far. For me it was two episodes. By episode 3 she lost her flair and by episode 4, the show started to get boring. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy shows with cutesy appeal but for a cutesy show to be good, it needsto be coupled with something else like a good story or comedy. The story is quite repetitive and eventually gets boring. Every episode, the characters decide to cook something, then they cook it. The End. As for comedy, their is nothing in this show that made me laugh. \\n\\n\r\nSo, should you watch Sweetness and Lightning? Well, I think you should try it. People obviously like it. I don't know if the high rating are just the initial hype or if there is something about this show that I'm not seeing. If it is the latter, then I don't want to take the enjoyment away from you, but know that there is a chance you will not like this show, like me.",

            "content": "Should you watch this anime? Short answer: yes. Long answer: not if you're into mecha anime.\r\n(Kidding.)\r\nI really, really, really like Amaama To Inazuma. It's called 'Sweetness And Lightning' for a reason- in an industry where, even with slice-of-life, apparently it's escalate the stakes or get cancelled, this anime is refreshingly low-conflict and heartwarming. Sometimes I don't want to watch the fate of the world be decided by three gigantic robots in an hour-long mega battle to the death, or see a bunch of high-school age kids beating the (physical or mental) shit out of each other in some competition to stay in their uber-competitive school.(That being said, if you're looking for action, you're in the wrong place. Sorry.) Sometimes I want to watch a (cute) single dad despair over how to get his (cute) daughter to eat green peppers.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nDefinitely one of the elements I love most about this anime. In my opinion, it's emotionally engaging, though a little slow at times- but in my opinion, that pace adds to its charm.  It's basically what it says in the description, so I won't draw it out for you- one thing I will say is that when I started watching, I was worried it was gonna turn into a teacher/student romantic relationship, but that's not the case at all. (Actually, the dad deals with the whole 'contact w a female student in his personal time outside of school' thing very appropriately.) (Conversely, if that's the kind of thing you're looking for, you're probably out of luck.)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nDefinitely no complaints. Art is beautiful, realistic, and fits the tone of the story- plus, all the characters are cute.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nSame as the art- fits the overall tone of the anime, well-selected.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nProbably the biggest strength of the anime, imo. The characters and their relationships and motivations are- wait for it- believable and easy to care about. I know. Crazy, huh.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, there aren't too many side characters introduced- i think the cast is mostly three mains and a handful of sides, which makes it easy to follow and focuses enough on the mains to really flesh out their characters. None of that 'well, these ten are the mcs, and these thirty are the side characters, and those other twenty pop up sometimes just for fun and to confuse the shit out of you.'\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5-10/10\\n\r\nI think the only thing holding me back from giving Amaama To Inazuma a full 10/10 rating is that the pacing can be a little slow sometimes- as of now, it's been four episodes, and one of the (i assume) mcs shown in the opening hasn't been introduced yet- but I would highly recommend this anime to anyone looking for something sweet, low-conflict, and heartwarming.",

            "content": "Growing up, I'm sure many of us have consumed one too many sugary sweets during our childhoods. We gouge down, smacking our lips, lapping up the remaining sticky stains that pepper our face, slurping the sweet syrup that coats our fingertips, savoring every last drop like sweet-tooth bandits. But after a while, that sugary delight leads to an unwelcome stomach ache, where we're left bloated and forced to endure the rightfully earned scorn of our parents:\r\n\"I told you not to eat all those sweets at once!\"\r\nTheir words a guilty sentence we don't even bother fighting against, as they march us off to the restroom tobrush away the very thought of potential cavities taking refuge between the crevices of our underdeveloped molars. It's the right of passage for us kids, for us mischievous sweet-tooth bandits. And if not for the proper guidance by our parents to keep us in line, we'd more than likely be sporting a smile with teeth weathered by decay. \\n\\n\r\nSweets are good, but overindulging in them tend to lead to this inevitable end result. And as you've undoubtedly figured out what's being alluded to by now, Sweetness and Lightning suffers a similar fate. A show that barrages you with all the cuteness that the namesake would imply\u2014and on that end, it certainly delivers\u2014but doesn't offer enough levity to let any of it settle in. It's all dessert without dinner, every child's wildest dream in theory, but in practice, a very tiresome endeavor that turns sweet-tooths rotten and palates too soaked to ask for more. Sweetness and Lightning shares in our delight for all things sugar-laced, but unlike the reprimanding we received as kids growing up, when this show overindulges, there aren't any parents around to scold it. And for an anime that centers around parenting, this becomes an issue that even the smile of a bubbly little girl couldn't dissuade you from taking notice of. \\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't much here to talk about, despite what the premise would have you believe: a man left to cope with the pain of losing a loved one while also raising a daughter, taking on all the motherly duties that he had once taken for granted. And during this adjustment period of serving both parental roles in his daughter's life, Sweetness used food as a catalyst to catalog his parental growth, as well as a common means for the father and daughter to become closer. With a premise that could serve multifaceted purposes\u2014parental bonding and culinary infotainment\u2014Sweetness and Lightning was practically gift wrapped for the creators. It wouldn't have had to do much in order to foster a lighthearted show with sobering life lessons sprinkled throughout it. Just simply display the culinary aspect as a vehicle to showcase the parental bonding; it's almost foolproof. And yet, even with this hand-delivered premise placed right in their laps, very little of it went beyond the occasional reminder of a motherless household and dishes reminiscent of a happier time in the father and daughter's life. Parenting was placed on the back-burner for food montages, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if that's all you came looking for, but when you take into consideration what ingredients the anime had at its disposal, the decision to divert from that path felt like an act of complacency than any intentional artistic statement. \\n\\n\r\nBut there's also something else that the show's setup alluded to. Something that isn't as important as the themes it skipped over but still a desirable promise nonetheless. And that promise was a cute mascot. And boy, did this anime ever deliver! Tsumugi is, with little dispute, one of the most adorable kid characters to have been conceived in the 2010s since the likes of Naru from Barakamon. She's cuteness that transcends regulatory standards. Cuteness that bursts past the stratosphere. Cuteness that almost hurts. Tsumugi is cuteness incarnate. And dear I say it, the sole reason for this show's existence. Without Tsumugi, there wouldn't be a Sweetness and Lightning worth discussing. Which, quite frankly, became a double-edged sword if you were watching the show for any other reason beyond its flagship character. Because when it comes to everything else that this anime attempted to offer, the act of slouching in disinterest became far too common of a practice. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the rest of the cast goes, there's really no other character worth mentioning beside Tsumugi. Everyone else was simply introduced to feed off her energy. To say she's the star attraction would be an understatement. The very foundation of this show's existences is made impossible without her inclusion. She's the poster-child of Sweetness and Lightning. The very thing people will remember the show for long after they forget the events of the show itself. It's the kind of character whose reputation would outlast the source material it's attached to. She's the Yuno Gasai, the Haruhi Suzumiya, the Holo, the Major Kusanagi; the very legacy that the source material will leave behind. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn't to say that the cooked meals and other characters introduced weren't interesting, just that in the backdrop of a show that's taking things slow and steady, all its efforts are lost in translation to the little girl twerking on the floor, practicing her cooking dance charms to make the food delicious. And when you pair that eccentric personality to that of an unkempt, mild-mannered man lost behind the bushy top hairdo and frame of his glasses that hide his soft-spoken expression... well, what you ended up getting was a recipe for amnesia-inducing content. \\n\\n\r\nIf I was placed on the spot to recall the events of any given episode, the best I could come up with would be: \"They cooked food, Tsumugi was being cute, they ate, and went back home.\" Not really the lasting legacy any creator would want now, is it? Whether premeditated or not, the show became one big blur when it effectively repeated the same scenario every single episode. Which brings us back to the pestering question: why was there no focus on parenting? \\n\\n\r\nIt's an aspect the show seems to hint at on several occasions, but whenever it gets too close to crossing that line between happy-go-lucky to something sobering, it skittishly pulls back and retreats to the kitchen to avoid confronting the elephant in the room. For what I could only surmise as the creators making decision to keep the same bubbly tone throughout, we're forced to only stand at the edge of parental responsibility. We could see the themes just lying there at the bottom but could never make the plunge due to the show's refusal to make that leap of faith. \\n\\n\r\nBut I guess for those that do love this carefree disposition, that isn't necessarily a bad thing at all. And if you're one who likes this more syrupy type of storytelling, then Sweetness and Lightning will certainly deliver. \\n\\n\r\nThis routine cycle I spoke of sees Kouhei, the soft-spoken father and full-time teacher, befriend one of his pupils named Kotori, a girl who's constantly on pins and needles with a mannerism that's best described as a series of micro-personality ticks and perpetual flustering. Together these two form a mutual friendship centered around their need to cook different kinds of dishes, as well as a means to keep each other company. And the source of influence that they both gravitate towards is, of course, our poster-child Tsumugi. And as the synopsis states, the rest of their time was spent cooking tasty treats while Tsumugi entrances the viewer with a barrage of cute antics.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as if the point wasn't made clear already, even the moments that don't focus on Tsumugi just ends up surrounding her anyways. The creative team behind Sweetness and Lightning are simply obsessed with their gooey gumdrop of a mascot. And by the looks of it, so am I at this point. \\n\\n\r\nTsumugi is adorable, but perhaps more important than that, she isn't sexualized; which to any outsider of the anime medium may seem like an odd thing to say about a child, but let's face it, Japan's obsession with sexualized lolis isn't something that just magically disappears when we don't pay attention to it. In the absence of World Masterpiece Theater's praiseworthy depiction of children, the \"moe\" boom of the early 2000s had created a paradigm shift that brought with it this current dilemma. So in that sense, Tsumugi is a HUGE breath of fresh air when the only other option for kid characters these days tend to be morphing them into moeblobs or letting a gust of wind expose their pantsu for purposes I think Jared from Subway would take far too much satisfaction in viewing. So until the current social norm for children characters changes in anime, Tsumugi stands as an example of one done right. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I'm sorry if I'm droning on and on about Tsumugi, but that's literally all the show leaves you to talk about. What was initially described by many as \"Barakamon meet Usagi Drop,\" simply became one facet of that idea when all aspects of parenting (or progression for that matter), had quickly abandoned ship. And so, with nothing else worth addressing, it's time for us to part ways as well, as I bring this review to its final stop. \\n\\n\r\n\"Too much of a good thing\" is the phrase that comes to mind when I reflect on this show. With a cute tyrant running rampant and a timid father trailing behind her, Sweetness and Lightning mostly became Sweetness and Pushover. Despite wanting the anime to take a leap into the parental aspect that it kept hinting at, I can't say I was displeased with what I got instead. If I had known that parenting wouldn't be an important aspect beforehand, I would have still watched the show for the sheer enjoyment of its meditative programming. Yes, it got a bit underwhelming and tedious at times. Yes, it could have done more to change up the formula. But, when all things were said and done, I still walked away with an adorable pint-sized bundle of joy that left me with a smile on my face. And at the end of the day, that sweet treat was good enough for me.",

            "content": "If slice of life, cuteness, delicious food, realism are on your bucket list the next anime you plan to watch, then think no more. Amaama no Inazuma (Sweetness and Lightning) is your answer. Taking the sweetness of slice of life and mix it with cooking accessories is just the tip of the iceberg. Believe me, this is a show that\u2019s more than about food. It packs a satisfying and emotional ride that\u2019s just too sweet to pass up.\r\nAdapted from the manga of the same name, the series is essentially a slice of life story of daily adventures. I should mention though, the story is prettysimple and straightforward. We got three main characters. There\u2019s Inuzuka Kouhei, a widowed math teacher who is struggling to support his daughter and home. There\u2019s Tsugumi, the overly charming kid with a picky taste at times. And finally, we got Iida Katori, a shy and lonely girl with a big appetite but bad cooking skills. So by formulaic standards, you might anticipate the food in the series to look atrocious. However, the show takes these characters and puts them into everyday life situations that brings the best out them. (and the food of course!)\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t really take long to get settled with the show. The first few episodes easily showcases the pattern of the story. Every episode in some way or form depicts the main characters cooking something delicious. However, there are also other segments that connects the characters\u2019 daily issues. For instance, Katori is lonely and often feels like she doesn\u2019t belong with others. However, her connection with Kouhei and Tsugumi brings out a more cheerful side of her. Meanwhile, Kouhei is also able to support Tsugumi better when the three of them work on making delicious food together. Tsugumi is also one of the most interesting characters. Being a kid, she lacks common sense at times like kids do. However, she also brings other characters together with her charming personality. From home to school, there\u2019s something that\u2019s hard to ignore about her. Whether it\u2019s her adorable smile, curiosity, or innocence, Tsugumi is someone that you can\u2019t help but want to make friends with. Her relationship with Kouhei is also very realistic with a strong daughter/father connection. Furthermore, Katori acts as a big sister to her. In one particular episode, she shows a very protective side after certain misunderstandings.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the main cast getting most of the screen time, side characters such as Kouhei\u2019s friend Yagi and Katori\u2019s classmate Shinobu also occasionally joins in to spice up the story. Characterization is a strong emphasis and this show never falls short from that. The downside is that some of these side characters will be overshadowed by the main cast. However, this isn\u2019t really a big issue as they still bring in the fun to the show especially when it comes to cooking.\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, after reading up to this point, you may be wondering if the show is worth the investment. After all, watching almost the same thing happen every episode may get repetitive. However, I can assure that not every episode follows a generic cooking session. Even in a small world that the how takes place in, there\u2019s plenty to explore when it comes to the story. Tsugumi\u2019s school life, Kouhei\u2019s daily challenges, and character relationships are just a few to name. Furthermore, the comedy of the show is genuinely refreshing. And while the series lacks extravagant food styles like Shokugeki no Souma or Toriko, it makes it up for its strong realism. The author\u2019s attempts at constructing the story by mixing in realistic drama, food gags, and character relationships really brings out the best of the series. As a manga reader, I am also satisfied with the adaptation despite some trending and rearrangement of the chapters.\\n\\n\r\nTMS Entertainment may not be a powerhouse studio. However, they definitely got the understanding to make this series look great. The visual quality is colorful and character designs are realistic to portray characters of all ages. Tsugumi is especially noticeable for her innocence and childish features. Even her clothes symbolizes youth and appeals to younger audience. I also have to give praise for the food creativity in the show. From gyoza, seafood, donuts, etc, there\u2019s all sorts of food you\u2019ll witness. Plus, the way they make the food is in great detail every episode to leave nothing out. \\n\\n\r\nYou may not realize it too much but the soundtrack and music has a strong appeal in the show too. The OP and ED theme songs are charmingly decorative with a catchy tone. The atmospheric OST brings out a good degree of realism ranging from cooking sessions to simple conversations. However, what I really praise is the character voice mannerism in particular Tsugumi. Believe it or not, she is actually voice by a child as well. The talent Rina Endou brings into her character really stands out as she steps into the shoes of Tsugumi. \\n\\n\r\nAmaama to Inzauma is a charming SOL family adventure that\u2019s simply memorable. Every episode brings something new to the table that goes far beyond just food. Character relationships is something that I think most will find realistic between a child and their parent. Rather than relying on flashy food shenanigans, the show brings the story to life with its credible realism. I can\u2019t say this enough but the show itself will almost always leave you hungry. In fact, the series experiments with more than just making the food. It shows how characters get together to build strong friendship and unity to accomplish a goal. And that is just quite something. \\n",

            "content": "Being some sort of antisocial, misanthropic millennial fuckwad, I have this sort of mentality where I believe that reproducing humans is stupid, children are awful human beings that are completely useless and unlikable until the ripe age of \u201cget a job you fucking bum\u201d, and being a parent sounds like the absolute worst thing that could happen to me right now.\r\nAnd therefore, I am here to tell you that Sweetness & Lightning, a slice-of-life about a father and his young daughter, is one of the best anime of the entire year.\r\nLet\u2019s get the overused joke of the season out of the way. \u201cThis show isso incredibly sweet!\u201d Yeah, that\u2019s fucking great, but why? Well, Amaama comes with a lot of heart, with a concept that\u2019s not only realistic but also relatable perhaps, as it\u2019s about a dad struggling to care for his daughter after the mother passed away because reasons. The dad does his best, but his job makes him busy all the time, and the daughter is just a sweet little girl who does sweet little girl things like watch dumb magical girl shows, say weird things that make no sense, and hate eating vegetables. The dad, Kouhei, is a good and caring parent for the most part, but has one severe flaw, which is being unable to cook, so this show is about fixing that. But Amaama also has an optimistic view on this scenario, as Tsumugi, the daughter, will be sick of eating something and not finish a meal, but still play it off as being full because she understands that she doesn\u2019t have any other options.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not a fierce melodrama. After watching the first episode, I had to consider that the show could\u2019ve become intensely emotional very easy, but it also looked like it was just gonna be a happy little slice-of-life cooking anime with a parenting theme behind it, with only small amounts of drama sprinkled throughout. It\u2019s the latter\u2026 and I\u2019m okay with that, because the basics of the show are shown so beautifully in the first episode, which was what I believe to be the best pilot episode of the season. The small details in the personalities of Kouhei, Tsumugi, and Kotori, the things that are shown instead of told (such as the leftover meal thing I mentioned), all with a very charming presentation by TMS Entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nThe show does get pretty repetitive, I\u2019ll give it that. The show does get pretty repetitive, I\u2019ll give it that. I\u2019ll give it that. And I do kinda wish there was a little more drama between Kouhei and Tsumugi to compensate for that, but personally I didn\u2019t mind the repetition because I watched it weekly on Crunchyroll\u2122, your #1 source for anime and drama, now teaming up with Funimation\u2122 to bring you more than ever!! So, having just a small dose of this heavy cuteness each week made it very tame for me. It never got old, and I looked forward to it each new week, though when the episode ended I didn\u2019t feel the insane need for the next episode. Even now that it\u2019s over\u2026 eh. I\u2019m alright with that. If they make another season, that\u2019s cool. If they don\u2019t, it was fun.\\n\\n\r\nBut back to repetitiveness as an issue. It is still an issue, a little bit, and I still think that more of the character drama would be nice, because that\u2019s probably what I liked most out of the show. Episode 7 was particularly outstanding because it had a big conflict, with the cooking aspect of the show not having much of a prevalence as it usually does. But usually, the episode will have something going on with Tsumugi, whether it\u2019s an event at school or she just generally wants something, and the rest of the episode will be about making a meal out of whatever can tie into that. Since it\u2019s a slice of life, there\u2019s no story progression to be had, so it\u2019s something that needs good characters in order to keep me coming back.\\n\\n\r\n...and it totally does. I think everyone would love to have a daughter like Tsumugi; even me, the 20-year-old deadbeat who wants to drop kick every child that runs around his workplace. I work at 2AM, WHERE DO THEY KEEP COMING FROM?! PUT YOUR FUCKING KIDS TO SLEEP!! FOREVER!!!!!!\\n\r\n*ahem*\\n\r\nThat said, Tsumugi is very idealized because this show needs to be pleasant to watch. While she\u2019s adorable and playful and excitable and kind (OR I GUESS YOU COULD SAY\u2026 SWEET!!! AHHAAHAHAHAHA), her only flaws are generally the same flaws a normal little kid would have. She get mad and cries over really petty things, like someone making the retarded assumption that she stole someone\u2019s Play-Doh. That kid was an asshole. Fuck that kid. No pedo tho. She doesn\u2019t like eating vegetables, and sometimes she\u2019ll get inappropriately mad in public. I guess I don\u2019t need to mention that she\u2019s five years old, or somewhere around that age. Still, for the sake of fun, I don\u2019t mind that she\u2019s not entirely realistic.\\n\\n\r\nKouhei, on the other hand, is much more realistic, being a dad who struggles a bit to care for his daughter without his wife. Watching him try really hard and act optimistically was really endearing to watch, and the basics of his character make him easy to root for. Each episode has a good payoff when he finishes cooking and the characters eat and react to it positively. And Kouhei stays humble, he\u2019s not an over-the-top character who bursts with excitement whenever something good happens. It\u2019s just a normal, but very genuine happiness. Tsumugi\u2019s the one who should be exaggerated.\\n\\n\r\nKotori is more of a third wheel in terms of development, as her role is to basically support Kouhei and Tsumugi with their cooking, and just generally be the best waifu of the season. (If any of you fucking say Rem I will shove your fucking head into a trash compactor where your shit waifus belong.) It\u2019s still great to watch her, \u2018cuz she\u2019s like an emotional weirdo who really really really wants dat sensei D or something, and so she gets worked up over whatever dilemma either Kouhei or Tsumugi have. She\u2019s basically a replacement mother here.\\n\\n\r\nI also wanna bring up Yagi, even though he\u2019s a very minor character who only shows up in about half the episodes. But it was always great to see him because he\u2019s more mature and very deadpan. Since Amaama just oozes with love and peppiness and excitement, it\u2019s nice to have a character that kinda balances everything out without taking away from the mood. He\u2019s still a nice guy and goes along with whatever\u2019s happening around him, he just presents a much more different mood. He\u2019s also followed around by Shinobu for some reason, making them fun to watch as some weird couple.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of the light-heartedness of Amaama to Inazuma, TMS Entertainment compliments it with a softer color palette and consistently good animation; at no point did I think it was particularly outstanding, but it still features some well-timed sakuga with some character reactions and cooking. The overall design of the backgrounds and characters are about average, but also as good as you could want them to be. However, Tsumugi in particular has the best hair of 2016. There\u2019s no contest to this, and if there is, you can shut it down right now because everyone has been absolutely blown the fuck out. I highly respect anyone with curly hair, especially if that hair is basically the size of their entire body. She\u2019ll put that hair into twin-tails a lot of the time, which is especially cute, moe, kawaii, and other synonyms. Tsumugi\u2019s entire design, especially with her childish expressions, just scream moe for the entire world to hear.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is equally exceptional, being very soft and gentle with few instruments being used, and it\u2019s implemented quite well. For instance, in the first episode, Kouhei and Tsumugi run through an alley, and it\u2019s a rather intense scene for this show, but only an acoustic guitar is playing, and it sets the rather sad mood perfectly. The OP, honestly, isn\u2019t my kind of thing to listen to, though I didn\u2019t skip it much. It\u2019s just another peppy, happy song that anyone could expect to hear in a sweet slice-of-life such as this. I like the ED, though, it sounds touching, hopeful, and slightly emotional, and the stylish illustrations to visualize it made for a beautiful cap on every episode.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is pretty solid as well, with great performances all-around in the main cast. Tsumugi is especially great because she was actually voiced by a child, something that isn\u2019t done enough. Granted, Rina Endou is a few years older, but she still sounded completely real. Tsumugi actually sounds like a goddamn child, and that\u2019s fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really loved Sweetness and Lightning and didn\u2019t mind its few flaws. At its worst, it was a repetitive moe slice-of-life Shokugeki no Soma that was still fun in its own right, and at its best it was a phenomenal character story with some moments so sweet that you could rot out all of Willy Wonka\u2019s teeth. ...oh wait, Gene Wilder died. Shit.\\n\\n\r\nI most certainly would recommend this to anyone in the mood for a slice-of-life that they would only watch in small doses instead of binging in one day, and anyone who wants an anime with a parenting theme. Though I also wouldn\u2019t recommend it if you\u2019re looking for drama, because this doesn\u2019t exactly have enough of it, even if it is good.\\n\\n\r\nBut I can\u2019t end this review without leaving a very important message\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Watch out for sharks!!\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nSweetness - PROTECT TSUMUGI\\n\r\nOverall - 8.25/10 (Range: 6-8.5)\\n\r\nFavorite episodes - 1, 7, 12\\n\r\nFavorite character - Kotori\\n\r\nRecommendation level - High",

            "content": "Imagine the most important person in your life, the one you love unconditionally, who takes care of you or your family, suddenly ceases to exist. In the grieving wake of the unexpected you cling to whatever is comforting, dreading beginning the next day without them. I have a friend who lost her fianc\u00e9 to a car accident a few years back, and although I couldn't empathize appropriately, I provided the support that I could for the disaster that rocked her world. She was left to take care of her then three year daughter and pick up the pieces along the way. In light of theinitial struggle, life stumbles on and we learn that we can be happy again, even after something as devastating as this. When I heard about Amaama to Inazuma's story, I instantly felt a sinking in my stomach. It reminded me so much of her situation and I knew i had to watch it. \\n\\n\r\nI want to take a minute to reset the somber tone I probably just created. While Amaama to Inazuma has its share of sad moments, this is a very endearing anime. The writers do a decent job of attaching us to the character's internal struggles through the medium of cooking. An added bonus is how much I personally enjoy the art of food... something I feel gets less serious attention in anime than it deserves. The average person will spend over four entire years of their lives cooking and eating, so it's only natural that it can be used to convey and heal our many issues in life. The relatively small cast bonds quite well over the course of the show and creates an enjoyable, episodic approach to everyday problems like socializing, raising children and managing loss.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Amaama is simple. A widower (Kouhei) taking care of his daughter is motivated to start cooking better when she questions why she never has a home cooked meal. This motivation, coupled with the use of one of his student's family restaurants helps Kouhei grow in both his cooking skills and relationship with his own daughter. That's pretty much it. This is not an anime you go into expecting a riveting or revolutionary story, or even a super engaging episode structure. It's best described as \"charming\", and you stay for the lighthearted atmosphere and Tsumugi's cute and cheeky personality. It's nothing to write home about, but its positivity and focus on food is what kept it afloat for me.\\n\\n\r\nI was delighted by Tsumugi's adorable demeanor in the first few episodes. She reminded me a lot of Naru from Barakamon or Rin from Usagi Drop, and embodied the actions of a six year old girl perfectly. She isn't written to be more mature than her age, and responds appropriately to the various situations she's placed in throughout the series. This is something I've noticed anime directors having problems with in the past. She's naturally innocent, and even throws tantrums from time to time... something I would truly expect from a six year old. Turns out she also doesn't care for green peppers. Yep, sounds like a typical six year old. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, as Tsumugi's charm began to fade (around episode 5 or so), the series began to trip over itself and become boring. The episodes began to become soothing and I actually found myself dozing off in the expanded cooking segments. Don't get me wrong, I love food and these segments were quite technically accurate, but it just didn't translate well into entertainment value. I actually thought I had watched the same episode a few times in a row due to their repetitive nature. I eventually found I enjoyed the non-cooking snippets more as the series went on, because they allowed the writers to focus on the relationship between Kouhei and Tsumugi more. It was for this reason I realized why shows like Usagi Drop are superior to Amaama to Inazuma. It's all about focus. While relationships were the focal point of the former, the cooking centered approach from the latter just didn't satisfy as much.\\n\\n\r\nAside from a few internal monologues and flashbacks, Kouhei is a rather bland protagonist. I guess it's only fitting, as Kotori's friend Shinobu pointed him out as \"plain\" near the beginning of the series. I feel Tsumugi's importance completely overshadowed him, and it would've been nice to get some development here as well. His relationship with Kotori was just as strange. I might be wrong in this assumption, but is it normal for a single, male teacher to be texting one of his high school students every day? There were even subtle instances of Kotori appearing to have feelings for him (which apparently are furthered in the manga). Subtle, but still there.  A rather unnecessary addition to the show, and one I'm still confused about. Maybe I'm just overthinking it, since Amaama is otherwise as innocent a show as you'll ever watch. Zero fan service, and zero cursing. A nice change of pace for sure.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't care for the rest of the cast in Amaama either. Kotori had a constant blush emblazoned on her cheeks, a testament to her nervous demeanor. She just didn't work as a character for me, but her strife was understood in regards to her parent's divorce and social anxiety. It's honestly more of a preference issue than actual character development. I'd actually argue that she receives the most out of any character in the show. Yagi and Shinobu are both rather one-dimensional characters that exist to propel the series forward. Both add slight comedic value, but ultimately aren't that important.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned previously, the characters look to correct both their internal struggles and awful cooking skills by focusing on food. The writers absolutely nailed this aspect of the show. I only learned to properly cook a few years ago, and every bad tendency I had when I initially started was explored here. Overcooking meals, screwing up recipes and the like were handled well, and the actual dish preparations were quite accurate. It really made me hungry at times. The scene with Kouhei filleting the fresh caught fish was a great example of Japanese culture, since they basically devoured the fish raw O_o  At any rate, I wish the same amount of effort would've been spent on other aspects of the series as well.\\n\\n\r\nSince it is 2016, I would hesitate to call the art in Amaama \"good\". It's relatively below average compared to most of the shows being released today. Even though the scenes are mostly still and not animation heavy, there were still instances of lazily drawn character models from time to time. I did appreciate the amount of life drawn into Tsumugi's character, and the artists did a great job adapting from the manga. The OP was a real toe-tapper, with an upbeat, cute melody that welcomed you to the show. The ED also fit nicely with the tone of the series, with the rest of the background music emphasizing the current scene appropriately. Nothing flashy or over composed here. Tsumugi's VA (Rina Endou) ironically voiced the overly shy Hina from Barakamon and excelled in Amaama as well. I like to see younger characters actually voiced by kids. \\n\\n\r\nIf you love food as much as I do, then Amaama to Izuma is an anime you cannot miss based on premise alone. Throw in an endearing girl rivaling only Naru from Barakamon in terms of cuteness and you've got a casual, feel-good show that engages your heart more and your mind less. It's definitely got its share of issues, but it makes for a great time passer, an anime best enjoyed occasionally. I'd recommend it to fans of Usagi Drop and Barakamon, or someone looking for something lighthearted to cheer them up. I did enjoy Amaama to Inazuma, but it isn't my favorite of the season. If for no other reason, watch it to learn a thing or two about cooking... I know I sure did!\\n\\n\r\nStory-5\\n\r\nArt-5\\n\r\nSound-7\\n\r\nCharacter-7\\n\r\nEnjoyment-7\\n\r\nOverall-6.4",

            "content": "Warning! There is a health risk if you attempt to watch this show. You may end up being diagnosed as diabetic because the anime is an overabundance of sweetness, cuteness and anything else imaginable. I never knew child-raising could be this fascinating.\r\nThis is a slice of life show that revolves around single parent Inuzuka Kouhei trying to provide better cooked meals for his pre-school daughter Tsumugi, who is bristling with energy. The doting parent is capable of cooking basic meals for her but his day job of being a high school teacher prevents him from making actual progression on his culinary skills. In an actof last resort, he stumbles across a restaurant that is owned by the family of Iida Kotori who luckily attends the same school where he works at.\\n\\n\r\nAs an act of consideration, she agrees to offering her knowledge to the inexperience Kouhei, allowing him to make meals with her guidance. There is a major catch though, funnily enough she can\u2019t handle sharp knives which limits her involvement in the preparation process. Despite this handicap she is still very resourceful mainly due to the fact that her mother is a cooking celebrity.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of just making delicious meals may sound boring initially but after going from cooking plain white rice to exotic meals that require expert precision, it has left a very good impression on me. This gives me encouragement to be a better cook myself as it\u2019s fairly common not knowing how to cook, when we have instant takeaways and such to contribute to our overall laziness. The enjoyment that Kouhei and Kotori gets being able to feed his daughter with nourishing meals fills him with delight and gives him a sense of pride. The whole premise is based on the fact that Kouhei\u2019s wife who was well-equipped a cook, sadly passes away for some unexplained reason.\\n\\n\r\nThe tragic loss of his wife who meant everything to him has made him realise the importance of having a family to care for. He acknowledges that Tsumugi would be orphaned if he were to meet the same fate as his spouse. This has affected his mental state to the point that he is a former shell of himself where he was brimming with passion in the household. The same can be said for his daughter, who is constantly reminded of her mother through the cooking made by the duo which reflects the sort of meals she once previously had. I cannot begin to imagine the torment she has to endure after he mother\u2019s death, as one so young can\u2019t fully understand the complex process until they\u2019ve matured to a certain point in their life.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the best part of the show as they are all relatable in some way or another. The single father is the one we can empathise with as death being a natural process is inevitable. The fact that he has to put up a front towards his daughter suggests that he really hasn\u2019t gotten over it and is hurting deep down. Tsumugi as the innocent kid is the one where I can project my past self into, partly due to being in similar situations that she has encountered. She doesn\u2019t have the privilege of two parents but that isn\u2019t stopping her from enjoying her everyday life.\\n\\n\r\nKotori is a strange one for me personally, the fact she developed some weird phobia of not using knives is bizarre. I don\u2019t care if she got a horrific cut on her hand, she needs to bite the bullet and move on. Apart from that, I have no problems with her as she is a gentle and affable individual. Yagi Yuusuke who is a close friend of Kouhei, make several appearances where he is primarily known to be taking care of Tsumugi in his stead due to work commitments. The man comes off as being devoid of personality but is actually known to be very fond for Tsumugi which sees him being affectionate the majority of time. Kojika Shinobu is the best friend of Kotori and for me is just your ordinary and regular girl who isn\u2019t outstanding in any way and also seems to enjoy being in the presence of the cute Tsumugi.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is not the best out there but the designs for each character are solid to say the least, giving an emphasis to the simplicity which is the most important factor. The design for Tsumugi might be a little over exaggerated but to be fair she is the focal point of the show, no need to make her look like the other generic kids in the pre-school. The show does not need excessive pretty visuals but effectively uses what is has to convey its message. The animation is nothing extraordinary with is being passable, I certainly wouldn\u2019t be too concerned about this aspect if I were you.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is far better than what the art had to offer. The voice actors in this show have some real pedigree except for Tsumugi who is actually voiced by a kid! The shark song was something I played endlessly as it was done perfectly. That would be too strange for an adult portraying as a kid, so good move there by the production committee. The soundtrack is composed by Toda Nobuko who has only worked for another show called One Week friends. The tracks can change from a pleasant to a somewhat melancholy mood immediately. The one track played during the actual cooking always gets to me with its upbeat atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is well worth watching for as a basic SOL with its good characters that are very much relatable. The interactions between them is well handled with nothing being too forced or unnecessary. The comedy is great but can be easily forgotten once the depressing stuff comes along which is very impactful. You really won\u2019t be disappointed with this as long as your expectations aren\u2019t astronomical. Keep it realistic and you\u2019ll find some value out of this.\\n",

            "content": "Ok, so another food porn anime has ended, and ah..........................:\r\nStorywise, it was just your typical food porn anime , where the plot wasn't about the widowed dad struggling to take care of his spunky daughter, it was more of spoiling his daughter's appetite with the dishes that this anime presents in every episode, so yes, this category is a 5 over 10.\r\nArt, pretty decent it I say so, there are no fanservices to speak off, none of that Zettai Ryouki thing, I mean there is really nothing for me to say about this anime's art, so for this category is a 4 over 10.\r\nSound, wellevery seiyuu who did the character's voice were ok, but my score is for the opening and Tsumugi's cute voice, it's a 7 over 10 here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, I give this part a 3 over 10, due to the fact that the character's here are quite a dichotomy. Now , you have a dad who was seemly not looking for another love interest after his wife died were it could be filled up by  Kotori Iida, his student. Now going back to the dad,  K\u014dhei Inuzuka, he strikes me as a wimpy type who somehow spoils his daughter Tsumugi whereby he can seem to give her some spanking when she's in a tantrum, also even in the manga he has to play this typical guy character who is the quintessential oblivious to the girl's feelings towards him.... I guess blame it on writers, Gido Amagakure  and Mitsutaka Hirota not making such arc possible , since Tsumugi seem  get along with Kotori Iida. As for Kotori Iida, I kinda like that she has the potential to be a good step mom to Tsumugi, but alas his anime ended without such arc occurring, btw I kinda hate it that this anime ended where she's still afraid of using knives, you one episode would have made such impact if there is a situation where she struggle to overcome her fear of knives with help of her sensei and then succeeds, but no this anime was just to focus on food and not making any development. Tsumugi Inuzuka maybe a cute and smart kid at one point you might wanna adore her, but on the other hand there are situations that you just wanna give her some spanking cu'z of her tantrums, so one more reason for the low score, cu'z I kinda feel like going there and give her some spanking. Also as for Shinobu Kojika and  Y\u016bsuke Yagi, it was too bad that studio TMS Entertainment didn't even bother to give them their own arc and just limit them as supports...another reason for my low score for this category.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, well it was enjoyable to a certain degree, but one would start to get bore after episode 7 and just go for the final episode, in my case , I've skip ep 9, 10 and 11, before going for ep 12. So, it's a 6 over 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is 3 over 10 since this anime's theme on food porn coincided with another anime with a food porn theme,  Shokugeki no Soma: The Second Plate, where it has more to offer than this anime. Thought they were shown on different schedules , they both belong to the same season and frankly it's a bad idea for  TMS Entertainment to pit this with the other anime, and that's that.\\n\\n\r\nSouma OUT!",

            "content": "The bliss of cooking and eating good food. The highs and lows of assuming both parental positions when raising a child. The anxiety of finding yourself alone and lost. Just to name a few things that this show brings to the viewer, it\u2019s been evident that Amaama to Inazuma is Summer 2016\u2019s slice-of-life darling thanks to its heartwarming premise.\r\nThe story focuses on Inuzuka Kouhei and his daughter Tsumugi who have been living quite the unhealthy convenience store-based lifestyle. He has no prior experience to cooking because it\u2019s his wife who recently passed away that usually cooks the meals. Here comes Kotori, who they found whilewalking in the park and is coincidentally a student in Kouhei\u2019s class. Usually reserved yet enthusiastic, she is always alone at home due to the fact that her parents are divorced and her mom is always busy with work which means she always eats by herself. Her sudden appearance revitalizes the joy of cooking in the Inuzuka household by dedicating each episode of the series into a cooking show format that still gives the essence of a slice-of-life story about family. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be honest to say that the first two or so episodes never failed to leave me teary-eyed. The show just does a great job on being down-to-earth. It gives out daily situations and how they fit into the life of the father-daughter duo with a sense of melancholy to it. Let\u2019s not forgot about Kotori either, the same applies with her and how she shares a common point with them produces quite the interesting synergy. I like the fact that Kouhei acts like a convincing father who can get angry when necessary, can get stressed with the overwhelming workload, and yet shows a very sincere concern and dedication to everything he does. Tsumugi upholds all the characteristics a typical young girl would have. Energetic, easily upset, adventurous, she is at the center of what makes this show exude with energy that just melts the heart. Other characters that add a bit of spice into the mix include the serious yet responsible Yagi who is Kouhei's high school friend, and also the cheerful and friendly Shinobu who is Kotori\u2019s close friend. With more people on the table, the atmosphere ever grows vibrant and welcoming to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nI have a soft spot for child-raising stories and also have interest in plots that revolve around food. However, the main weakness the show has is trying to find a balance between the two. Sure, they are both what makes the show appealing but focusing on one aspect for too long gives less room for the other. For example, there are episodes that have some good potential story progression regarding how each of the characters cope up with internal struggles but the growing tension gets diminished by shifting the mood to a lighthearted cooking activity. While I do see that cooking is sort of a coping mechanism for the cast, I feel like they could have cut back on the minutes dedicated to it. There are a lot of procedures in each meal they create that could have been excluded with only the highlights of the recipe shown. Also, not every problem can be simply solved through cooking which make the problems that could provide better character development look superficial. There is also the issue of the absence of mother figures in both the life of Kotori (although not literal) and the Inuzukas. The subject is often touched occasionally but never really got to be explored further which is a shame because I think it is a good thing plot-wise. The issue of divorce and how it affects Kotori\u2019s mindset towards the idea of family could have been a nice issue to be tackled with. It is implied that the Inuzukas are already past the stage of grieving but it\u2019d be nice if the show did something like coming up with the terms of loss, healing oneself through finding joy in moments shared with friends around you.\\n\\n\r\nIn the long run, Amaama to Inazuma is still a nice slice-of-life show recommended to anyone who wants something heartwarming and cute with the twist of going through gastronomic adventures by the episode. Story-wise it\u2019s not the most fulfilling one out there due to half of its content dedicated to cooking but it definitely rewards the viewer with visually appealing food, the chemistry of the cast, and its humble approach towards family.\\n",

            "content": "To sum up my review of this show, I'll give you a statement. I was shocked at how sweet this show was. Okay, bad jokes over with, now on to the review.\r\nAmaama to Inazuma, or Sweetness and Lightning (hence the bad joke prior), is a fairly relaxed slice of life that found itself debuting in a season where many other shows stole the limelight. Premiering alongside extremely popular shows like Re:Zero and Food wars, this cute show didn't get that attention it truly deserved. However this did not stop the show from shining in the eyes of many of it's viewers. I for one, absolutelyloved this show, but more on that in the Enjoyment section\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\\n\r\nAs it goes for most slices of life anime, story isn't a huge part of the show, so I will do my best to review the setting and progression in general. The story itself isn't anything spectacular; A Father loses his wife to illness(?) and finds himself having a hard time taking care of both his work and his daughter at the same time. One day, the father Inuzuka Kouhei and his daughter Tsumugi find another person struggling to find connection with others, Iida Kotori. Kouhei discovers that a fun way he can relate to Tsumugi is through the creation and eating of cooking, something his late wife was in charge of instead. The show itself covers the little adventures and happenings of the groups lives, and the different meals they create, as well as the happy times they experience together. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, each episode is fairly standalone, but the way the stories each week are presented feels very realistic. Many of the things that happen seem like things that would actually be happening in a young childs life, such as Tsumugi's constant range of emotions, even to her interactions with her classmates and family/friends. Amaama's portrayal of life for a young child feels very real, and this is something that anime as a medium of art, oftentimes runs into trouble approaching. \\n\\n\r\nOne more thing worth touching on is the lack of real conclusion of the show. The final episode really just feels like every other episode, and lacks any real finality to it. Personally I find this to be a perfectly fine approach to a more relaxed slice of life show, as it leaves the ending very open, with the possibility of more seasons, as this show could definitely go for longer (provided the budget, ofcourse).\\n\\n\r\nArt.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of Art, the show wasn't anything spectacular, but still was very clean. In terms of cooking anime, such as the ever famous Food Wars, it's animation is not nearly as flashy, but instead reflects the much more mellow mood of the show. The art is by no means poor. In fact, I thought it was one of the better looking shows of the season (that I watched of course). \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of character design, and setting, the characters aren't extravagant, and the settings aren't diverse and interesting, but they instead reflect the feel of normality and realism that the show conveys. Apart from Tsumugi and her voluptuous hair, the show itself displays itself very plainly, but still is rather pretty in it's own light.\\n\\n\r\nSound. \\n\\n\r\nSound tends to be a strange topic to approach as it encompasses a lot of pieces. I will break it down into two major chunks, those being Voice Acting\\n\r\nand Music.\\n\\n\r\nFor voice acting, I was very impressed. Amaama is one of the first shows I've seen cast an actual child (Rina Endou who is 10 as I'm typing this) to play the main role, and she did brilliantly. Tsumugi's voice was absolutely adorable, and displayed a wide range of emotions, which would prove very difficult for a young voice actress, so I do commend Rina Endou for her great work in this show. Other voice actors performed competently as well. Nakamura Yuuichi did a splendid job as Inuzuka Kouhei, and really felt at home in the role of a worried father. One of the most impactful scenes of the show, when Inuzuka sensei is looking for Tsumugi after she had left the house while he was sick, involved Nakamura shouting in a voice that conveyed true dispair and worry, and left many audience members impressed.\\n\\n\r\nAs for music, the music was fairly consistent. The opening song is quite good and cute, and all of Tsumugi's self composed songs were extremely entertaining (my favorite being the no Clump song and dance).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, I found the show fairly strong. Many slice of life shows don't put a lot of focus on character development, but I felt that Amaama did a good job at it. Tsumugi's character was immensely enjoyable and fun to watch, whether it be her silly normal self, or how she dealt with complicated emotions for a child, she remained extremely fun and enjoyable to watch throughout the whole show. Inuzuka Kouhei wasn't a terribly unique character, but he and Tsumugi both developed strongly throughout the show as their bond grew stronger and stronger. Inuzuka sensei's fairly relaxed and worrying nature reflected that of a father who truly was doing his best to give Tsumugi everything he could, despite being a widower, and allowed for his character to be very relatable and understandable.\\n\\n\r\nKotori was developed fairly well over the series as well, as she is a character who is struggling with loneliness due to her Mother's constant absence due to work. However, as she begins to interact with the Inuzuka family as well as the other minor characters, she begins to gain a better understanding of how to interact with people, and how her mother feels. Throughout the series she had a hard time dealing with her Mother's absence, but by the final episode, she has realized that her mother is doing her best, and finally gets to experience a meal with her and the new friends she's found.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, which are Yagi and Shinobu, they weren't developed very much but still had defined characters which led to interesting interactions with the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show immensely. As an anime viewer, I tend to be more serious and critical, which is reflected in my average rating statistics, but I found myself with a constant smile watching this. By no means am I a smiley person, but the sheer cuteness this show had astounded me. Tsumugi is one of the funniest and cutest characters I've seen in an anime, and I enjoyed her wacky adventures through life and food. The loving interactions of a father and his daughter are portrayed well and are extremely heartwarming to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a very fun and enjoyable anime to watch. Of course it has it's issues as every show does, but it is simply one of the most enjoyable slice of life shows I've watched. If you haven't watched it, try the first episode, because you'll fall for the show faster than you'd think.\\n\\n\r\nIf you'd like to further discuss anything, or have any questions, you are always free to add or message me. Thanks for reading the review guys and gals.\\n",

            "content": "Sweetness and Lightning is a slice-of-life title focused on widowed father and teacher Kohei and his daughter Tsumugi, who get together with one of Kohei's students, Kotori, to make delicious meals at the restaurant of Kotori's mother. The series mixes around some light humor and drama with exploring the everyday challenges that Kohei has with raising his daughter as a widowed father and establishing their current relationship with Kotori for the three to get together to learn to prepare meals.\r\nWhat makes the premise for this series work is that it strikes a balance of both being relateable to audiences thanks to Kohei and Tsumugi's domesticsituation, and the cooking component making for an immersive component thanks to the work and satisfaction that goes into cooking and eating them. With the mundane feel of the series, Sweetness and Lightning has Tsumugi believably behave for a child her age (and voiced by a child seiyuu as well) and undergo many of the typical quirks someone of her age would have such as amazement of experiencing new things. hating to eat certain vegetables, and raising tantrums if something doesn't go her way. It also believably explores the joys and challenges that Kohei can have with raising her on his own where he can lose his composure if Tsumugi misbehaves or does anything to concern him, and both of them also show signs of coping from the loss of Kohei's wife through enjoying the meals that they prepare with Kotori.\\n\\n\r\nThe cooking component of the series makes for the very heart of the series. While the premise would seem like a dull one due to the slice-of-life genre it is part of, the series offers enough focus on the developments of our trio of characters in cooking meals throughout the span of the series. Compare Kohei's skills with food preparation at the start of the series as a complete novice to how well he can manage by the end of it with the subtle improvements he has made in learning to cook. All the cooking scenes with the three show them getting satisfaction out of meal preparation and eventually able to salivate from the results of their hard work with a tasty meal. The visuals for the series also go to great lengths to show off believable detail with the food made, and make the viewer feel just as tempted to try out said prepared food.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Sweetness and Lightning made for a charming and surprisingly enjoyable slice-of-life anime thanks to the nice balance of believable focus on Kohei and Tsurugi's everyday life and the focus on their cooking sessions with Kotori. A definite recommendation for slice-of-life anime fans.",

Not that much right? Well are you expecting for his daughter to get some cancer or suddenly have superpowers,etc to make the show interesting? Well im glad they dont make this anime like that... maybe some of you have been watchbarakamon and wonder why this anime have lower score than barakamon with similar story plot... But i can assure you this anime is worth it. It doesnt as funny like barakamon but in amaama to inazuma you will see how deep a father's love for his daughter, you will see some laughs,heartwarming scene,and some struggle this anime will tell you in detail the daily life of a single parent dad who loves his little daughter.",

            "content": "I started this series because I was looking for a cooking anime. By episode 12, it had stolen my heart completely.\r\nSweetness and Lightning features a single dad, Inuzaka Kouhei, trying very much to provide for his young daughter, Tsumugi, who doesn't completely understand that mama is gone but tries every day to live without her. Does that grab your heart? Good. That's exactly what it should do, because that's human. Inuzaka-san tries to provide for his daughter, but his meals are frozen and reheated, and don't meet the Japanese standard of handmade bento - he barely knows how to handle a microwave, let alone astove and a kitchen knife. Tsumugi doesn't *mind*, but her father longs to do better for her. Now, in the United States, and across Japan, that's just life. Single parents try really hard, and don't always succeed.\\n\\n\r\nBut we get the wonderful Iida Kotori, who offers up her family's restaurant as a wholesome place to try all sorts of recipes. Kotori is afraid of knives - she has a bandage on one of her fingers for the entire series - but she consults her famous mother for recipes that will make Tsumugi happy. Kotori is more afraid of knives than Inuzaka-san, by a lot, but together they build a partnership to provide Tsumugi with handmade, wholesome meals in a safe, gentle, empowering environment.\\n\\n\r\nThe show becomes, primarily, about how Tsumugi bonds with her father in the wake of her mother's death with the help of Kotori. Kotori's best friend Shinobu, and Inuzaka-san's chef best friend Yagi, become important characters, but they very deliberately withdraw so the father-high school girl-daughter groupings can slice, dice, and cook together. At one point, Shinobu points out Tsumugi, Inuzaka-san, and Kotori and says, roughly, \"This is a treasure we need to protect,\" and they do for the rest of the series, very deliberately giving tasks to them and taking care of the grunt work when the father-daughter pair need a break. Even Yagi, who is rough around the edges but is extremely skilled in the kitchen, backs off so Tsumugi can explore the wonders of food.\\n\\n\r\nTsumugi is written and delivered as a little girl who loves food, loves her daddy, loves shoujo anime, and misses her mommy so much that it hurts. Her voice actor, Endou Rina, at only 11-12 years of age channeled the wonder, imagination, fears, love, and *tantrums* of a young child. Yes, she has adorably cute moments - the sharky-sharky-shark song is part of anime lore. But she wasn't always cute - some commentators hate this - Tsumugi flies off the handle sometimes for what seems like the stupidest thing.\\n\\n\r\nThat's actually one of the strengths of the series and of Endou Rina as Tsumugi. Tsumugi is an irrational little girl. A boy keeps teasing Tsumugi, and the anime makes clear that it's not okay and that he is punished for it by his attentive mother, but it also shows that they get along - sometimes. Her best friend hurts her feelings really badly. She cries about things that adults can handle and that adults are really confused about until they think about what she's feeling, at her age level. Her daddy speaks sharply to her (in a Japanese context; the subtitles don't really convey it all the time), and they both regret it. She breaks out into tears because of something that doesn't make sense to her, her dad, or anyone until they have a chance to talk about it. That's exactly how life was for me with my little sister after my mom died. My dad and I helped raise my little sister, with very much the same challenges - I saw those first difficult years replicated again and again in this series, including the eventual healing and the creation of new family and love structures in the wake of loss. The authenticity of Amaama to Inazuma won me over pretty early - broken families look for a place to center themselves and find a new equilibrium, and that's exactly what they did in this series.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a 1/1 adaptation from the manga, note that the romance subplot is completely excised - and I agree with it in the context of this 12-episode series. Kotori is completely focused on helping to strengthen the relationship between Inuzaka-sensei and Tsumugi in this series, and if you want to ship people you'll have to look to the manga. Sweetness and Lightning is entirely about a family attracting a community that defends the bonding of father, daughter, and high school culinary expert against all odds, and it's beautiful. It's been accused of causing diabetes because of how sweet and nice it is, and I hope you can experience the wholesome love of a single father for his little girl like I did.",

This show wants to have its cake and eat it too; it dabbles in scarce poignant moments, but never incorporates them into the narrative directly, just as triggers for empathy (we don't see anyone dealing with the issues at hand, we simply see themin the background, as if to make the life of our characters noble). \\n\r\nThe comedy is non-existent, literally, no jokes or gags other than over-the-top hacky cutesy behavior. \\n\r\nAnd last but not least, I don't see this being grounded in the reality it pretends to belong to, namely, non of the characters being anything more than one dimensional stock characters living in a world where nothing bad ever happens, never mind how many mistakes you make. It doesn't matter that you neglect your child's nutrition and non-school social life, she will be a happy-go-lucky soul; never mind that the situations you put yourself in is vastly open for cynical misinterpretation, such things don't happen.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot shake off the suspicion that this show is being mendacious.\\n\r\nIt seems to me that the director is perfectly aware of the blatantly shallow nature of the entire story, so resorting to gimmicks was all.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think there's anything missing in your life if you haven't watched this.\\n\r\nSome people definitely enjoy it, but for the \" upbeat cute kid\" element, there's Naru from \"Barakamon\" and for the \"single father\" element, there's the great \"Usagi Drop\".",

            "content": "So what happens if Shokugeki no Souma was a bit more basic and instead of fanservice was turned moe?...well here's a taste of Amaama to Inazuma.\r\nAmaama to Inazuma has a rather adorable plot due to the nature of the anime, to make good food and just to make it moe as hell with one character like Tsumugi Inuzuka voiced by Rina Endou. The premise at best are following the trend of food anime but with the unique slice of life moe twist to it and even though LA didn't have any intentions of watching this anime, LA's friend got interested so LA did to..............also becauseof Saori Hayami. What?.....\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters we actually have a rather unique set of characters, the widow father Kouhei Inuzuka voiced by Yuuichi Nakamura and his daughter Tsumugi who acts like what an actual kids sounds and acts like as well as Kotori Iida voiced by Saori Hayami the main crux of this anime trying to teach Kouhei how to cook food for Tsumugi and really even though Tsumugi is the more real-like kid, LA just couldn't get enough of Kotori in the series and probably the main reason why LA liked this anime soo much, it was most probably due to Saori Hayami's vocals...\"probably\"...\\n\\n\r\nThere are other things from Amaama to Inazuma other than the cooking however such as typical messages of family but some more daring ones later on such as Tsumugi going off in her own to help his dad that later gets more complicated to hell, in cooking terms...an adult's taste isn't obvious the same as a little kids. Amaama to Inazuma is still subtle it how it approaches it and still tries to focus more on the food than the more serious and \"unneeded drama\" it pulls. It's a slice of life cooking show with all the moe to go around...what do you expect when seeing a character like Tsumugi in an anime like this?. Amaama to Inazuma's themes is giving off the obvious eating food with your family or just people you know makes the food taste better, it later focuses more on family themes.\\n\\n\r\nThere was however one worry LA always had when watching this anime and no it wasn't the serious drama or it being \"too moe\", LA was more or less worried that Kotori would somewhat \"replace\" Kouhei's wife (a sorta of mother surrogate) due to the nature of what this anime does and that will lead it as a far too controversial topic (teacher x student issue), thankfully, LA's worry was dispelled by the end of the anime and it NEVER went there...touched upon but more on the loss of the mother than trying to replace her.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by TMS Entertainment, the character designs are pretty decent for the most part and although the backgrounding work is the mostly the same houses of Tsumugi's kindergarten to Kouhei's house  to Kotori's most of the time, the backgrounding like the character designs are decent, now the food animation instead the same quality as say Shokugeki no Souma's as it's more of homemade food than the gourmet side that Shokugeki no Souma gives us, but nonetheless the food animation is also pretty decent and like Shokugeki no Souma, the \"technical feature\" of making the food is pretty excellent in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, well it was solid throughout and even though LA's reasoning as to why LA watched the anime was for Saori Hayami (and she is LA's favourite seiyuu in this anime), props too easily goes to Rina Endou who voiced Tsumugi for this, Kouhei's voice actor Yuuichi Nakamura at best was good but better during the more rare dramatic moments but he was great in voicing a dad character. The rest of the minor voice actors are decent at best with some highlights with Shinbou Kojika voiced by Haruka Tomatsu as well as Kotori's mother Megumi Iida voiced by the ever eccentric Satomi Arai.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending if anything brings in the same format of most of the episodes given with Kouhei and Tsumugi having a squabble of some sorts, they go to Kotori's house to cook food that Tsumugi wanted (be it one they found in a restaurant or Tsumugi's kindergarten and wants to make one done by Kotori and Kouhei) and they resolve their problem with some parental guidance. It's the same typical fair and that isn't a bad thing as it is what Amaama to Inazuma does. LA was satisfied by the ending no less.\\n\\n\r\nAmaama to Inazuma has a nice concept with some homemade food and some adorable characters to add into the mix and people might find Amaama to Inazuma a bit repetitive and \"moe\" with food in the mix, heck Koufuku Graffiti even fits into this bill, but Amaama to Inazuma still has that appeal from it's characters to the whole point of the anime is for a parent who couldn't cook, learn how to cook for his daughter and Amaama to Inazuma deals with the problem of parental problems every parent deals with which helps solidifies this anime as a pretty good sit.",

            "content": "Every episode of Amaama to Inazuma is atomically engineered to melt your heart. Two of the three main characters, obviously the father and daughter, really got me whenever they interacted with each other. \r\nThe world revolves around Tsumugi because she is everything good in the world and needs to be cherished and protected at all costs. However overwhelmingly adorable, Tsumugi's character was flawless because of her flaws. Not to be written off as a perfect child, Tsumugi can also be a brat at times, allowing the viewer to relate and develop a stronger connection with her. \r\nKohei is seemingly the perfect dad for almost thesame reason. At every opportunity, he pours his heart into caring for Tsumugi in the most perfect ways possible. His daughter is his first, second, and third priority in life and that in itself fills my mouth with cavities by how sweet it is. Of course, when Tsumugi is acting like a daughter, Kohei has to act as the father. Admitting that his delivery at times can be wrong, it's visible to the viewer that his struggle of finding the balance between scolding and spoiling to be entirely real.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Iida is a great character in her own right, but even as I consider her a main character, she still takes a seat in the sidecar as Tsumugi and Kohei steal the show with their father-daughter relationship.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, overall and objectively I give the anime a 9/10, I have to personally add a +1 modifier for how much I had to physically react while watching this. It was extremely heartwarming and cute. I absolutely adore the opening. The supporting characters were great as well. The art was very standard, but what made it good was the very real expressions with the bouncy animations. And who can stand by and not make a remark on how good food looks in anime?",

            "content": "I do not understand why people are comparing this to Food Wars, the two are not similar since they are aimed at a different demographic audience. My review will be based on the fact that this is meant for older men and not for teenagers who are wanting action, fan service, or romance. Once you get through the fact that none of these will be present during the show, you might understand why I am so confused to the comparison of the two shows.\r\nTLDR : This isn't Food Wars. Stop comparing the two.\r\nSTORY : 8\r\n I cannot say that the story is the best, buthowever, it is realistic in the sense that people do take some time to move on from major events and not everyone can easily let go of memories of others. This story is very heartwarming as it shows the slow progress of going through grief and dealing with the fact that an important role in the family is now permanently gone and shows the better side of being a single parent. The story is very realistic and is actually similar to something I am currently dealing with now, so this has struck home to me.\\n\\n\r\nART : 8\\n\r\n Same thing with the story, it's not the best, but it certainly catches my attention and sometimes boggles my mind. You just have to appreciate that the father never got his daughter a haircut.... >_>\\n\\n\r\nSound : 7\\n\r\n I am not a avid listener, but it is somewhat appealing to hear some music and the sounds of cooking, even when it's a slow simmer. Nothing too special here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 9\\n\r\n These characters have their own personality and each seem like a realistic character pulled from someone's memory. Each one has their own goals and their own burden. I am not too sure how to explain each character, since I am at a loss of words, but each one is lovable in their own way. Romance isn't shown between the characters since there is a huge age difference and things would cause problems at school. This I feel is extremely realistic since \\n\r\nI deal with this at schools myself.\\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment : 10\\n\r\n Need I to explain how realistic the kids are? The students too. I wish my classrooms were a bit like these students, but I can't have it all.... can I?\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8\\n\r\n This anime is worth watching for the fun of seeing a special bond being made and having great memories being made from simple everyday actions that we do. We seriously do take the simplest things for granted. It makes you think about what things you have everyday, and what if that just disappeared. Making memories using cooking is probably the best way to show a family bond, in my opinion, and it was done extremely well. This wouldn't win a award, but it certainly will always be in my memories.\\n",

It is somewhat of a sad story, and is able to establish a good sense of realism, since it is not to far fetched.

The most captivating part the show was Tsumugi. Her adorableness pretty much drove the show, but it could only drive it so far. For me it was two episodes. By episode 3 she lost her flair and by episode 4, the show started to get boring. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy shows with cutesy appeal but for a cutesy show to be good, it needsto be coupled with something else like a good story or comedy. The story is quite repetitive and eventually gets boring. Every episode, the characters decide to cook something, then they cook it. The End. As for comedy, their is nothing in this show that made me laugh. \\n\\n\r\nSo, should you watch Sweetness and Lightning? Well, I think you should try it. People obviously like it. I don't know if the high rating are just the initial hype or if there is something about this show that I'm not seeing. If it is the latter, then I don't want to take the enjoyment away from you, but know that there is a chance you will not like this show, like me.",

            "content": "Should you watch this anime? Short answer: yes. Long answer: not if you're into mecha anime.\r\n(Kidding.)\r\nI really, really, really like Amaama To Inazuma. It's called 'Sweetness And Lightning' for a reason- in an industry where, even with slice-of-life, apparently it's escalate the stakes or get cancelled, this anime is refreshingly low-conflict and heartwarming. Sometimes I don't want to watch the fate of the world be decided by three gigantic robots in an hour-long mega battle to the death, or see a bunch of high-school age kids beating the (physical or mental) shit out of each other in some competition to stay in their uber-competitive school.(That being said, if you're looking for action, you're in the wrong place. Sorry.) Sometimes I want to watch a (cute) single dad despair over how to get his (cute) daughter to eat green peppers.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nDefinitely one of the elements I love most about this anime. In my opinion, it's emotionally engaging, though a little slow at times- but in my opinion, that pace adds to its charm.  It's basically what it says in the description, so I won't draw it out for you- one thing I will say is that when I started watching, I was worried it was gonna turn into a teacher/student romantic relationship, but that's not the case at all. (Actually, the dad deals with the whole 'contact w a female student in his personal time outside of school' thing very appropriately.) (Conversely, if that's the kind of thing you're looking for, you're probably out of luck.)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nDefinitely no complaints. Art is beautiful, realistic, and fits the tone of the story- plus, all the characters are cute.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nSame as the art- fits the overall tone of the anime, well-selected.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nProbably the biggest strength of the anime, imo. The characters and their relationships and motivations are- wait for it- believable and easy to care about. I know. Crazy, huh.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, there aren't too many side characters introduced- i think the cast is mostly three mains and a handful of sides, which makes it easy to follow and focuses enough on the mains to really flesh out their characters. None of that 'well, these ten are the mcs, and these thirty are the side characters, and those other twenty pop up sometimes just for fun and to confuse the shit out of you.'\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5-10/10\\n\r\nI think the only thing holding me back from giving Amaama To Inazuma a full 10/10 rating is that the pacing can be a little slow sometimes- as of now, it's been four episodes, and one of the (i assume) mcs shown in the opening hasn't been introduced yet- but I would highly recommend this anime to anyone looking for something sweet, low-conflict, and heartwarming.",

But after a while, that sugary delight leads to an unwelcome stomach ache, where we're left bloated and forced to endure the rightfully earned scorn of our parents:\r\n\"I told you not to eat all those sweets at once!\"\r\nTheir words a guilty sentence we don't even bother fighting against, as they march us off to the restroom tobrush away the very thought of potential cavities taking refuge between the crevices of our underdeveloped molars. It's the right of passage for us kids, for us mischievous sweet-tooth bandits. And if not for the proper guidance by our parents to keep us in line, we'd more than likely be sporting a smile with teeth weathered by decay. \\n\\n\r\nSweets are good, but overindulging in them tend to lead to this inevitable end result. And as you've undoubtedly figured out what's being alluded to by now, Sweetness and Lightning suffers a similar fate. A show that barrages you with all the cuteness that the namesake would imply\u2014and on that end, it certainly delivers\u2014but doesn't offer enough levity to let any of it settle in. It's all dessert without dinner, every child's wildest dream in theory, but in practice, a very tiresome endeavor that turns sweet-tooths rotten and palates too soaked to ask for more. Sweetness and Lightning shares in our delight for all things sugar-laced, but unlike the reprimanding we received as kids growing up, when this show overindulges, there aren't any parents around to scold it. And for an anime that centers around parenting, this becomes an issue that even the smile of a bubbly little girl couldn't dissuade you from taking notice of. \\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't much here to talk about, despite what the premise would have you believe: a man left to cope with the pain of losing a loved one while also raising a daughter, taking on all the motherly duties that he had once taken for granted. And during this adjustment period of serving both parental roles in his daughter's life, Sweetness used food as a catalyst to catalog his parental growth, as well as a common means for the father and daughter to become closer. With a premise that could serve multifaceted purposes\u2014parental bonding and culinary infotainment\u2014Sweetness and Lightning was practically gift wrapped for the creators. It wouldn't have had to do much in order to foster a lighthearted show with sobering life lessons sprinkled throughout it. Just simply display the culinary aspect as a vehicle to showcase the parental bonding; it's almost foolproof. And yet, even with this hand-delivered premise placed right in their laps, very little of it went beyond the occasional reminder of a motherless household and dishes reminiscent of a happier time in the father and daughter's life. Parenting was placed on the back-burner for food montages, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if that's all you came looking for, but when you take into consideration what ingredients the anime had at its disposal, the decision to divert from that path felt like an act of complacency than any intentional artistic statement. \\n\\n\r\nBut there's also something else that the show's setup alluded to. Something that isn't as important as the themes it skipped over but still a desirable promise nonetheless. And that promise was a cute mascot. And boy, did this anime ever deliver! Tsumugi is, with little dispute, one of the most adorable kid characters to have been conceived in the 2010s since the likes of Naru from Barakamon. She's cuteness that transcends regulatory standards. Cuteness that bursts past the stratosphere. Cuteness that almost hurts. Tsumugi is cuteness incarnate. And dear I say it, the sole reason for this show's existence. Without Tsumugi, there wouldn't be a Sweetness and Lightning worth discussing. Which, quite frankly, became a double-edged sword if you were watching the show for any other reason beyond its flagship character. Because when it comes to everything else that this anime attempted to offer, the act of slouching in disinterest became far too common of a practice. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the rest of the cast goes, there's really no other character worth mentioning beside Tsumugi. Everyone else was simply introduced to feed off her energy. To say she's the star attraction would be an understatement. The very foundation of this show's existences is made impossible without her inclusion. She's the poster-child of Sweetness and Lightning. The very thing people will remember the show for long after they forget the events of the show itself. It's the kind of character whose reputation would outlast the source material it's attached to. She's the Yuno Gasai, the Haruhi Suzumiya, the Holo, the Major Kusanagi; the very legacy that the source material will leave behind. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn't to say that the cooked meals and other characters introduced weren't interesting, just that in the backdrop of a show that's taking things slow and steady, all its efforts are lost in translation to the little girl twerking on the floor, practicing her cooking dance charms to make the food delicious. And when you pair that eccentric personality to that of an unkempt, mild-mannered man lost behind the bushy top hairdo and frame of his glasses that hide his soft-spoken expression... well, what you ended up getting was a recipe for amnesia-inducing content. \\n\\n\r\nIf I was placed on the spot to recall the events of any given episode, the best I could come up with would be: \"They cooked food, Tsumugi was being cute, they ate, and went back home.\" Not really the lasting legacy any creator would want now, is it? Whether premeditated or not, the show became one big blur when it effectively repeated the same scenario every single episode. Which brings us back to the pestering question: why was there no focus on parenting? \\n\\n\r\nIt's an aspect the show seems to hint at on several occasions, but whenever it gets too close to crossing that line between happy-go-lucky to something sobering, it skittishly pulls back and retreats to the kitchen to avoid confronting the elephant in the room. For what I could only surmise as the creators making decision to keep the same bubbly tone throughout, we're forced to only stand at the edge of parental responsibility. We could see the themes just lying there at the bottom but could never make the plunge due to the show's refusal to make that leap of faith. \\n\\n\r\nBut I guess for those that do love this carefree disposition, that isn't necessarily a bad thing at all. And if you're one who likes this more syrupy type of storytelling, then Sweetness and Lightning will certainly deliver. \\n\\n\r\nThis routine cycle I spoke of sees Kouhei, the soft-spoken father and full-time teacher, befriend one of his pupils named Kotori, a girl who's constantly on pins and needles with a mannerism that's best described as a series of micro-personality ticks and perpetual flustering. Together these two form a mutual friendship centered around their need to cook different kinds of dishes, as well as a means to keep each other company. And the source of influence that they both gravitate towards is, of course, our poster-child Tsumugi. And as the synopsis states, the rest of their time was spent cooking tasty treats while Tsumugi entrances the viewer with a barrage of cute antics.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as if the point wasn't made clear already, even the moments that don't focus on Tsumugi just ends up surrounding her anyways. The creative team behind Sweetness and Lightning are simply obsessed with their gooey gumdrop of a mascot. And by the looks of it, so am I at this point. \\n\\n\r\nTsumugi is adorable, but perhaps more important than that, she isn't sexualized; which to any outsider of the anime medium may seem like an odd thing to say about a child, but let's face it, Japan's obsession with sexualized lolis isn't something that just magically disappears when we don't pay attention to it. In the absence of World Masterpiece Theater's praiseworthy depiction of children, the \"moe\" boom of the early 2000s had created a paradigm shift that brought with it this current dilemma. So in that sense, Tsumugi is a HUGE breath of fresh air when the only other option for kid characters these days tend to be morphing them into moeblobs or letting a gust of wind expose their pantsu for purposes I think Jared from Subway would take far too much satisfaction in viewing. So until the current social norm for children characters changes in anime, Tsumugi stands as an example of one done right. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I'm sorry if I'm droning on and on about Tsumugi, but that's literally all the show leaves you to talk about. What was initially described by many as \"Barakamon meet Usagi Drop,\" simply became one facet of that idea when all aspects of parenting (or progression for that matter), had quickly abandoned ship. And so, with nothing else worth addressing, it's time for us to part ways as well, as I bring this review to its final stop. \\n\\n\r\n\"Too much of a good thing\" is the phrase that comes to mind when I reflect on this show. With a cute tyrant running rampant and a timid father trailing behind her, Sweetness and Lightning mostly became Sweetness and Pushover. Despite wanting the anime to take a leap into the parental aspect that it kept hinting at, I can't say I was displeased with what I got instead. If I had known that parenting wouldn't be an important aspect beforehand, I would have still watched the show for the sheer enjoyment of its meditative programming. Yes, it got a bit underwhelming and tedious at times. Yes, it could have done more to change up the formula. But, when all things were said and done, I still walked away with an adorable pint-sized bundle of joy that left me with a smile on my face. And at the end of the day, that sweet treat was good enough for me.",

            "content": "If slice of life, cuteness, delicious food, realism are on your bucket list the next anime you plan to watch, then think no more. Amaama no Inazuma (Sweetness and Lightning) is your answer. Taking the sweetness of slice of life and mix it with cooking accessories is just the tip of the iceberg. Believe me, this is a show that\u2019s more than about food. It packs a satisfying and emotional ride that\u2019s just too sweet to pass up.\r\nAdapted from the manga of the same name, the series is essentially a slice of life story of daily adventures. I should mention though, the story is prettysimple and straightforward. We got three main characters. There\u2019s Inuzuka Kouhei, a widowed math teacher who is struggling to support his daughter and home. There\u2019s Tsugumi, the overly charming kid with a picky taste at times. And finally, we got Iida Katori, a shy and lonely girl with a big appetite but bad cooking skills. So by formulaic standards, you might anticipate the food in the series to look atrocious. However, the show takes these characters and puts them into everyday life situations that brings the best out them. (and the food of course!)\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t really take long to get settled with the show. The first few episodes easily showcases the pattern of the story. Every episode in some way or form depicts the main characters cooking something delicious. However, there are also other segments that connects the characters\u2019 daily issues. For instance, Katori is lonely and often feels like she doesn\u2019t belong with others. However, her connection with Kouhei and Tsugumi brings out a more cheerful side of her. Meanwhile, Kouhei is also able to support Tsugumi better when the three of them work on making delicious food together. Tsugumi is also one of the most interesting characters. Being a kid, she lacks common sense at times like kids do. However, she also brings other characters together with her charming personality. From home to school, there\u2019s something that\u2019s hard to ignore about her. Whether it\u2019s her adorable smile, curiosity, or innocence, Tsugumi is someone that you can\u2019t help but want to make friends with. Her relationship with Kouhei is also very realistic with a strong daughter/father connection. Furthermore, Katori acts as a big sister to her. In one particular episode, she shows a very protective side after certain misunderstandings.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the main cast getting most of the screen time, side characters such as Kouhei\u2019s friend Yagi and Katori\u2019s classmate Shinobu also occasionally joins in to spice up the story. Characterization is a strong emphasis and this show never falls short from that. The downside is that some of these side characters will be overshadowed by the main cast. However, this isn\u2019t really a big issue as they still bring in the fun to the show especially when it comes to cooking.\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, after reading up to this point, you may be wondering if the show is worth the investment. After all, watching almost the same thing happen every episode may get repetitive. However, I can assure that not every episode follows a generic cooking session. Even in a small world that the how takes place in, there\u2019s plenty to explore when it comes to the story. Tsugumi\u2019s school life, Kouhei\u2019s daily challenges, and character relationships are just a few to name. Furthermore, the comedy of the show is genuinely refreshing. And while the series lacks extravagant food styles like Shokugeki no Souma or Toriko, it makes it up for its strong realism. The author\u2019s attempts at constructing the story by mixing in realistic drama, food gags, and character relationships really brings out the best of the series. As a manga reader, I am also satisfied with the adaptation despite some trending and rearrangement of the chapters.\\n\\n\r\nTMS Entertainment may not be a powerhouse studio. However, they definitely got the understanding to make this series look great. The visual quality is colorful and character designs are realistic to portray characters of all ages. Tsugumi is especially noticeable for her innocence and childish features. Even her clothes symbolizes youth and appeals to younger audience. I also have to give praise for the food creativity in the show. From gyoza, seafood, donuts, etc, there\u2019s all sorts of food you\u2019ll witness. Plus, the way they make the food is in great detail every episode to leave nothing out. \\n\\n\r\nYou may not realize it too much but the soundtrack and music has a strong appeal in the show too. The OP and ED theme songs are charmingly decorative with a catchy tone. The atmospheric OST brings out a good degree of realism ranging from cooking sessions to simple conversations. However, what I really praise is the character voice mannerism in particular Tsugumi. Believe it or not, she is actually voice by a child as well. The talent Rina Endou brings into her character really stands out as she steps into the shoes of Tsugumi. \\n\\n\r\nAmaama to Inzauma is a charming SOL family adventure that\u2019s simply memorable. Every episode brings something new to the table that goes far beyond just food. Character relationships is something that I think most will find realistic between a child and their parent. Rather than relying on flashy food shenanigans, the show brings the story to life with its credible realism. I can\u2019t say this enough but the show itself will almost always leave you hungry. In fact, the series experiments with more than just making the food. It shows how characters get together to build strong friendship and unity to accomplish a goal. And that is just quite something. \\n",

            "content": "Being some sort of antisocial, misanthropic millennial fuckwad, I have this sort of mentality where I believe that reproducing humans is stupid, children are awful human beings that are completely useless and unlikable until the ripe age of \u201cget a job you fucking bum\u201d, and being a parent sounds like the absolute worst thing that could happen to me right now.\r\nAnd therefore, I am here to tell you that Sweetness & Lightning, a slice-of-life about a father and his young daughter, is one of the best anime of the entire year.\r\nLet\u2019s get the overused joke of the season out of the way. \u201cThis show isso incredibly sweet!\u201d Yeah, that\u2019s fucking great, but why? Well, Amaama comes with a lot of heart, with a concept that\u2019s not only realistic but also relatable perhaps, as it\u2019s about a dad struggling to care for his daughter after the mother passed away because reasons. The dad does his best, but his job makes him busy all the time, and the daughter is just a sweet little girl who does sweet little girl things like watch dumb magical girl shows, say weird things that make no sense, and hate eating vegetables. The dad, Kouhei, is a good and caring parent for the most part, but has one severe flaw, which is being unable to cook, so this show is about fixing that. But Amaama also has an optimistic view on this scenario, as Tsumugi, the daughter, will be sick of eating something and not finish a meal, but still play it off as being full because she understands that she doesn\u2019t have any other options.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not a fierce melodrama. After watching the first episode, I had to consider that the show could\u2019ve become intensely emotional very easy, but it also looked like it was just gonna be a happy little slice-of-life cooking anime with a parenting theme behind it, with only small amounts of drama sprinkled throughout. It\u2019s the latter\u2026 and I\u2019m okay with that, because the basics of the show are shown so beautifully in the first episode, which was what I believe to be the best pilot episode of the season. The small details in the personalities of Kouhei, Tsumugi, and Kotori, the things that are shown instead of told (such as the leftover meal thing I mentioned), all with a very charming presentation by TMS Entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nThe show does get pretty repetitive, I\u2019ll give it that. The show does get pretty repetitive, I\u2019ll give it that. I\u2019ll give it that. And I do kinda wish there was a little more drama between Kouhei and Tsumugi to compensate for that, but personally I didn\u2019t mind the repetition because I watched it weekly on Crunchyroll\u2122, your #1 source for anime and drama, now teaming up with Funimation\u2122 to bring you more than ever!! So, having just a small dose of this heavy cuteness each week made it very tame for me. It never got old, and I looked forward to it each new week, though when the episode ended I didn\u2019t feel the insane need for the next episode. Even now that it\u2019s over\u2026 eh. I\u2019m alright with that. If they make another season, that\u2019s cool. If they don\u2019t, it was fun.\\n\\n\r\nBut back to repetitiveness as an issue. It is still an issue, a little bit, and I still think that more of the character drama would be nice, because that\u2019s probably what I liked most out of the show. Episode 7 was particularly outstanding because it had a big conflict, with the cooking aspect of the show not having much of a prevalence as it usually does. But usually, the episode will have something going on with Tsumugi, whether it\u2019s an event at school or she just generally wants something, and the rest of the episode will be about making a meal out of whatever can tie into that. Since it\u2019s a slice of life, there\u2019s no story progression to be had, so it\u2019s something that needs good characters in order to keep me coming back.\\n\\n\r\n...and it totally does. I think everyone would love to have a daughter like Tsumugi; even me, the 20-year-old deadbeat who wants to drop kick every child that runs around his workplace. I work at 2AM, WHERE DO THEY KEEP COMING FROM?! PUT YOUR FUCKING KIDS TO SLEEP!! FOREVER!!!!!!\\n\r\n*ahem*\\n\r\nThat said, Tsumugi is very idealized because this show needs to be pleasant to watch. While she\u2019s adorable and playful and excitable and kind (OR I GUESS YOU COULD SAY\u2026 SWEET!!! AHHAAHAHAHAHA), her only flaws are generally the same flaws a normal little kid would have. She get mad and cries over really petty things, like someone making the retarded assumption that she stole someone\u2019s Play-Doh. That kid was an asshole. Fuck that kid. No pedo tho. She doesn\u2019t like eating vegetables, and sometimes she\u2019ll get inappropriately mad in public. I guess I don\u2019t need to mention that she\u2019s five years old, or somewhere around that age. Still, for the sake of fun, I don\u2019t mind that she\u2019s not entirely realistic.\\n\\n\r\nKouhei, on the other hand, is much more realistic, being a dad who struggles a bit to care for his daughter without his wife. Watching him try really hard and act optimistically was really endearing to watch, and the basics of his character make him easy to root for. Each episode has a good payoff when he finishes cooking and the characters eat and react to it positively. And Kouhei stays humble, he\u2019s not an over-the-top character who bursts with excitement whenever something good happens. It\u2019s just a normal, but very genuine happiness. Tsumugi\u2019s the one who should be exaggerated.\\n\\n\r\nKotori is more of a third wheel in terms of development, as her role is to basically support Kouhei and Tsumugi with their cooking, and just generally be the best waifu of the season. (If any of you fucking say Rem I will shove your fucking head into a trash compactor where your shit waifus belong.) It\u2019s still great to watch her, \u2018cuz she\u2019s like an emotional weirdo who really really really wants dat sensei D or something, and so she gets worked up over whatever dilemma either Kouhei or Tsumugi have. She\u2019s basically a replacement mother here.\\n\\n\r\nI also wanna bring up Yagi, even though he\u2019s a very minor character who only shows up in about half the episodes. But it was always great to see him because he\u2019s more mature and very deadpan. Since Amaama just oozes with love and peppiness and excitement, it\u2019s nice to have a character that kinda balances everything out without taking away from the mood. He\u2019s still a nice guy and goes along with whatever\u2019s happening around him, he just presents a much more different mood. He\u2019s also followed around by Shinobu for some reason, making them fun to watch as some weird couple.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of the light-heartedness of Amaama to Inazuma, TMS Entertainment compliments it with a softer color palette and consistently good animation; at no point did I think it was particularly outstanding, but it still features some well-timed sakuga with some character reactions and cooking. The overall design of the backgrounds and characters are about average, but also as good as you could want them to be. However, Tsumugi in particular has the best hair of 2016. There\u2019s no contest to this, and if there is, you can shut it down right now because everyone has been absolutely blown the fuck out. I highly respect anyone with curly hair, especially if that hair is basically the size of their entire body. She\u2019ll put that hair into twin-tails a lot of the time, which is especially cute, moe, kawaii, and other synonyms. Tsumugi\u2019s entire design, especially with her childish expressions, just scream moe for the entire world to hear.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is equally exceptional, being very soft and gentle with few instruments being used, and it\u2019s implemented quite well. For instance, in the first episode, Kouhei and Tsumugi run through an alley, and it\u2019s a rather intense scene for this show, but only an acoustic guitar is playing, and it sets the rather sad mood perfectly. The OP, honestly, isn\u2019t my kind of thing to listen to, though I didn\u2019t skip it much. It\u2019s just another peppy, happy song that anyone could expect to hear in a sweet slice-of-life such as this. I like the ED, though, it sounds touching, hopeful, and slightly emotional, and the stylish illustrations to visualize it made for a beautiful cap on every episode.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is pretty solid as well, with great performances all-around in the main cast. Tsumugi is especially great because she was actually voiced by a child, something that isn\u2019t done enough. Granted, Rina Endou is a few years older, but she still sounded completely real. Tsumugi actually sounds like a goddamn child, and that\u2019s fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really loved Sweetness and Lightning and didn\u2019t mind its few flaws. At its worst, it was a repetitive moe slice-of-life Shokugeki no Soma that was still fun in its own right, and at its best it was a phenomenal character story with some moments so sweet that you could rot out all of Willy Wonka\u2019s teeth. ...oh wait, Gene Wilder died. Shit.\\n\\n\r\nI most certainly would recommend this to anyone in the mood for a slice-of-life that they would only watch in small doses instead of binging in one day, and anyone who wants an anime with a parenting theme. Though I also wouldn\u2019t recommend it if you\u2019re looking for drama, because this doesn\u2019t exactly have enough of it, even if it is good.\\n\\n\r\nBut I can\u2019t end this review without leaving a very important message\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Watch out for sharks!!\\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nSweetness - PROTECT TSUMUGI\\n\r\nOverall - 8.25/10 (Range: 6-8.5)\\n\r\nFavorite episodes - 1, 7, 12\\n\r\nFavorite character - Kotori\\n\r\nRecommendation level - High",

            "content": "Imagine the most important person in your life, the one you love unconditionally, who takes care of you or your family, suddenly ceases to exist. In the grieving wake of the unexpected you cling to whatever is comforting, dreading beginning the next day without them. I have a friend who lost her fianc\u00e9 to a car accident a few years back, and although I couldn't empathize appropriately, I provided the support that I could for the disaster that rocked her world. She was left to take care of her then three year daughter and pick up the pieces along the way. In light of theinitial struggle, life stumbles on and we learn that we can be happy again, even after something as devastating as this. When I heard about Amaama to Inazuma's story, I instantly felt a sinking in my stomach. It reminded me so much of her situation and I knew i had to watch it. \\n\\n\r\nI want to take a minute to reset the somber tone I probably just created. While Amaama to Inazuma has its share of sad moments, this is a very endearing anime. The writers do a decent job of attaching us to the character's internal struggles through the medium of cooking. An added bonus is how much I personally enjoy the art of food... something I feel gets less serious attention in anime than it deserves. The average person will spend over four entire years of their lives cooking and eating, so it's only natural that it can be used to convey and heal our many issues in life. The relatively small cast bonds quite well over the course of the show and creates an enjoyable, episodic approach to everyday problems like socializing, raising children and managing loss.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of Amaama is simple. A widower (Kouhei) taking care of his daughter is motivated to start cooking better when she questions why she never has a home cooked meal. This motivation, coupled with the use of one of his student's family restaurants helps Kouhei grow in both his cooking skills and relationship with his own daughter. That's pretty much it. This is not an anime you go into expecting a riveting or revolutionary story, or even a super engaging episode structure. It's best described as \"charming\", and you stay for the lighthearted atmosphere and Tsumugi's cute and cheeky personality. It's nothing to write home about, but its positivity and focus on food is what kept it afloat for me.\\n\\n\r\nI was delighted by Tsumugi's adorable demeanor in the first few episodes. She reminded me a lot of Naru from Barakamon or Rin from Usagi Drop, and embodied the actions of a six year old girl perfectly. She isn't written to be more mature than her age, and responds appropriately to the various situations she's placed in throughout the series. This is something I've noticed anime directors having problems with in the past. She's naturally innocent, and even throws tantrums from time to time... something I would truly expect from a six year old. Turns out she also doesn't care for green peppers. Yep, sounds like a typical six year old. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, as Tsumugi's charm began to fade (around episode 5 or so), the series began to trip over itself and become boring. The episodes began to become soothing and I actually found myself dozing off in the expanded cooking segments. Don't get me wrong, I love food and these segments were quite technically accurate, but it just didn't translate well into entertainment value. I actually thought I had watched the same episode a few times in a row due to their repetitive nature. I eventually found I enjoyed the non-cooking snippets more as the series went on, because they allowed the writers to focus on the relationship between Kouhei and Tsumugi more. It was for this reason I realized why shows like Usagi Drop are superior to Amaama to Inazuma. It's all about focus. While relationships were the focal point of the former, the cooking centered approach from the latter just didn't satisfy as much.\\n\\n\r\nAside from a few internal monologues and flashbacks, Kouhei is a rather bland protagonist. I guess it's only fitting, as Kotori's friend Shinobu pointed him out as \"plain\" near the beginning of the series. I feel Tsumugi's importance completely overshadowed him, and it would've been nice to get some development here as well. His relationship with Kotori was just as strange. I might be wrong in this assumption, but is it normal for a single, male teacher to be texting one of his high school students every day? There were even subtle instances of Kotori appearing to have feelings for him (which apparently are furthered in the manga). Subtle, but still there.  A rather unnecessary addition to the show, and one I'm still confused about. Maybe I'm just overthinking it, since Amaama is otherwise as innocent a show as you'll ever watch. Zero fan service, and zero cursing. A nice change of pace for sure.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't care for the rest of the cast in Amaama either. Kotori had a constant blush emblazoned on her cheeks, a testament to her nervous demeanor. She just didn't work as a character for me, but her strife was understood in regards to her parent's divorce and social anxiety. It's honestly more of a preference issue than actual character development. I'd actually argue that she receives the most out of any character in the show. Yagi and Shinobu are both rather one-dimensional characters that exist to propel the series forward. Both add slight comedic value, but ultimately aren't that important.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned previously, the characters look to correct both their internal struggles and awful cooking skills by focusing on food. The writers absolutely nailed this aspect of the show. I only learned to properly cook a few years ago, and every bad tendency I had when I initially started was explored here. Overcooking meals, screwing up recipes and the like were handled well, and the actual dish preparations were quite accurate. It really made me hungry at times. The scene with Kouhei filleting the fresh caught fish was a great example of Japanese culture, since they basically devoured the fish raw O_o  At any rate, I wish the same amount of effort would've been spent on other aspects of the series as well.\\n\\n\r\nSince it is 2016, I would hesitate to call the art in Amaama \"good\". It's relatively below average compared to most of the shows being released today. Even though the scenes are mostly still and not animation heavy, there were still instances of lazily drawn character models from time to time. I did appreciate the amount of life drawn into Tsumugi's character, and the artists did a great job adapting from the manga. The OP was a real toe-tapper, with an upbeat, cute melody that welcomed you to the show. The ED also fit nicely with the tone of the series, with the rest of the background music emphasizing the current scene appropriately. Nothing flashy or over composed here. Tsumugi's VA (Rina Endou) ironically voiced the overly shy Hina from Barakamon and excelled in Amaama as well. I like to see younger characters actually voiced by kids. \\n\\n\r\nIf you love food as much as I do, then Amaama to Izuma is an anime you cannot miss based on premise alone. Throw in an endearing girl rivaling only Naru from Barakamon in terms of cuteness and you've got a casual, feel-good show that engages your heart more and your mind less. It's definitely got its share of issues, but it makes for a great time passer, an anime best enjoyed occasionally. I'd recommend it to fans of Usagi Drop and Barakamon, or someone looking for something lighthearted to cheer them up. I did enjoy Amaama to Inazuma, but it isn't my favorite of the season. If for no other reason, watch it to learn a thing or two about cooking... I know I sure did!\\n\\n\r\nStory-5\\n\r\nArt-5\\n\r\nSound-7\\n\r\nCharacter-7\\n\r\nEnjoyment-7\\n\r\nOverall-6.4",

            "content": "Warning! There is a health risk if you attempt to watch this show. You may end up being diagnosed as diabetic because the anime is an overabundance of sweetness, cuteness and anything else imaginable. I never knew child-raising could be this fascinating.\r\nThis is a slice of life show that revolves around single parent Inuzuka Kouhei trying to provide better cooked meals for his pre-school daughter Tsumugi, who is bristling with energy. The doting parent is capable of cooking basic meals for her but his day job of being a high school teacher prevents him from making actual progression on his culinary skills. In an actof last resort, he stumbles across a restaurant that is owned by the family of Iida Kotori who luckily attends the same school where he works at.\\n\\n\r\nAs an act of consideration, she agrees to offering her knowledge to the inexperience Kouhei, allowing him to make meals with her guidance. There is a major catch though, funnily enough she can\u2019t handle sharp knives which limits her involvement in the preparation process. Despite this handicap she is still very resourceful mainly due to the fact that her mother is a cooking celebrity.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of just making delicious meals may sound boring initially but after going from cooking plain white rice to exotic meals that require expert precision, it has left a very good impression on me. This gives me encouragement to be a better cook myself as it\u2019s fairly common not knowing how to cook, when we have instant takeaways and such to contribute to our overall laziness. The enjoyment that Kouhei and Kotori gets being able to feed his daughter with nourishing meals fills him with delight and gives him a sense of pride. The whole premise is based on the fact that Kouhei\u2019s wife who was well-equipped a cook, sadly passes away for some unexplained reason.\\n\\n\r\nThe tragic loss of his wife who meant everything to him has made him realise the importance of having a family to care for. He acknowledges that Tsumugi would be orphaned if he were to meet the same fate as his spouse. This has affected his mental state to the point that he is a former shell of himself where he was brimming with passion in the household. The same can be said for his daughter, who is constantly reminded of her mother through the cooking made by the duo which reflects the sort of meals she once previously had. I cannot begin to imagine the torment she has to endure after he mother\u2019s death, as one so young can\u2019t fully understand the complex process until they\u2019ve matured to a certain point in their life.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the best part of the show as they are all relatable in some way or another. The single father is the one we can empathise with as death being a natural process is inevitable. The fact that he has to put up a front towards his daughter suggests that he really hasn\u2019t gotten over it and is hurting deep down. Tsumugi as the innocent kid is the one where I can project my past self into, partly due to being in similar situations that she has encountered. She doesn\u2019t have the privilege of two parents but that isn\u2019t stopping her from enjoying her everyday life.\\n\\n\r\nKotori is a strange one for me personally, the fact she developed some weird phobia of not using knives is bizarre. I don\u2019t care if she got a horrific cut on her hand, she needs to bite the bullet and move on. Apart from that, I have no problems with her as she is a gentle and affable individual. Yagi Yuusuke who is a close friend of Kouhei, make several appearances where he is primarily known to be taking care of Tsumugi in his stead due to work commitments. The man comes off as being devoid of personality but is actually known to be very fond for Tsumugi which sees him being affectionate the majority of time. Kojika Shinobu is the best friend of Kotori and for me is just your ordinary and regular girl who isn\u2019t outstanding in any way and also seems to enjoy being in the presence of the cute Tsumugi.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is not the best out there but the designs for each character are solid to say the least, giving an emphasis to the simplicity which is the most important factor. The design for Tsumugi might be a little over exaggerated but to be fair she is the focal point of the show, no need to make her look like the other generic kids in the pre-school. The show does not need excessive pretty visuals but effectively uses what is has to convey its message. The animation is nothing extraordinary with is being passable, I certainly wouldn\u2019t be too concerned about this aspect if I were you.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is far better than what the art had to offer. The voice actors in this show have some real pedigree except for Tsumugi who is actually voiced by a kid! The shark song was something I played endlessly as it was done perfectly. That would be too strange for an adult portraying as a kid, so good move there by the production committee. The soundtrack is composed by Toda Nobuko who has only worked for another show called One Week friends. The tracks can change from a pleasant to a somewhat melancholy mood immediately. The one track played during the actual cooking always gets to me with its upbeat atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is well worth watching for as a basic SOL with its good characters that are very much relatable. The interactions between them is well handled with nothing being too forced or unnecessary. The comedy is great but can be easily forgotten once the depressing stuff comes along which is very impactful. You really won\u2019t be disappointed with this as long as your expectations aren\u2019t astronomical. Keep it realistic and you\u2019ll find some value out of this.\\n",

            "content": "Ok, so another food porn anime has ended, and ah..........................:\r\nStorywise, it was just your typical food porn anime , where the plot wasn't about the widowed dad struggling to take care of his spunky daughter, it was more of spoiling his daughter's appetite with the dishes that this anime presents in every episode, so yes, this category is a 5 over 10.\r\nArt, pretty decent it I say so, there are no fanservices to speak off, none of that Zettai Ryouki thing, I mean there is really nothing for me to say about this anime's art, so for this category is a 4 over 10.\r\nSound, wellevery seiyuu who did the character's voice were ok, but my score is for the opening and Tsumugi's cute voice, it's a 7 over 10 here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, I give this part a 3 over 10, due to the fact that the character's here are quite a dichotomy. Now , you have a dad who was seemly not looking for another love interest after his wife died were it could be filled up by  Kotori Iida, his student. Now going back to the dad,  K\u014dhei Inuzuka, he strikes me as a wimpy type who somehow spoils his daughter Tsumugi whereby he can seem to give her some spanking when she's in a tantrum, also even in the manga he has to play this typical guy character who is the quintessential oblivious to the girl's feelings towards him.... I guess blame it on writers, Gido Amagakure  and Mitsutaka Hirota not making such arc possible , since Tsumugi seem  get along with Kotori Iida. As for Kotori Iida, I kinda like that she has the potential to be a good step mom to Tsumugi, but alas his anime ended without such arc occurring, btw I kinda hate it that this anime ended where she's still afraid of using knives, you one episode would have made such impact if there is a situation where she struggle to overcome her fear of knives with help of her sensei and then succeeds, but no this anime was just to focus on food and not making any development. Tsumugi Inuzuka maybe a cute and smart kid at one point you might wanna adore her, but on the other hand there are situations that you just wanna give her some spanking cu'z of her tantrums, so one more reason for the low score, cu'z I kinda feel like going there and give her some spanking. Also as for Shinobu Kojika and  Y\u016bsuke Yagi, it was too bad that studio TMS Entertainment didn't even bother to give them their own arc and just limit them as supports...another reason for my low score for this category.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, well it was enjoyable to a certain degree, but one would start to get bore after episode 7 and just go for the final episode, in my case , I've skip ep 9, 10 and 11, before going for ep 12. So, it's a 6 over 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is 3 over 10 since this anime's theme on food porn coincided with another anime with a food porn theme,  Shokugeki no Soma: The Second Plate, where it has more to offer than this anime. Thought they were shown on different schedules , they both belong to the same season and frankly it's a bad idea for  TMS Entertainment to pit this with the other anime, and that's that.\\n\\n\r\nSouma OUT!",

            "content": "The bliss of cooking and eating good food. The highs and lows of assuming both parental positions when raising a child. The anxiety of finding yourself alone and lost. Just to name a few things that this show brings to the viewer, it\u2019s been evident that Amaama to Inazuma is Summer 2016\u2019s slice-of-life darling thanks to its heartwarming premise.\r\nThe story focuses on Inuzuka Kouhei and his daughter Tsumugi who have been living quite the unhealthy convenience store-based lifestyle. He has no prior experience to cooking because it\u2019s his wife who recently passed away that usually cooks the meals. Here comes Kotori, who they found whilewalking in the park and is coincidentally a student in Kouhei\u2019s class. Usually reserved yet enthusiastic, she is always alone at home due to the fact that her parents are divorced and her mom is always busy with work which means she always eats by herself. Her sudden appearance revitalizes the joy of cooking in the Inuzuka household by dedicating each episode of the series into a cooking show format that still gives the essence of a slice-of-life story about family. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be honest to say that the first two or so episodes never failed to leave me teary-eyed. The show just does a great job on being down-to-earth. It gives out daily situations and how they fit into the life of the father-daughter duo with a sense of melancholy to it. Let\u2019s not forgot about Kotori either, the same applies with her and how she shares a common point with them produces quite the interesting synergy. I like the fact that Kouhei acts like a convincing father who can get angry when necessary, can get stressed with the overwhelming workload, and yet shows a very sincere concern and dedication to everything he does. Tsumugi upholds all the characteristics a typical young girl would have. Energetic, easily upset, adventurous, she is at the center of what makes this show exude with energy that just melts the heart. Other characters that add a bit of spice into the mix include the serious yet responsible Yagi who is Kouhei's high school friend, and also the cheerful and friendly Shinobu who is Kotori\u2019s close friend. With more people on the table, the atmosphere ever grows vibrant and welcoming to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nI have a soft spot for child-raising stories and also have interest in plots that revolve around food. However, the main weakness the show has is trying to find a balance between the two. Sure, they are both what makes the show appealing but focusing on one aspect for too long gives less room for the other. For example, there are episodes that have some good potential story progression regarding how each of the characters cope up with internal struggles but the growing tension gets diminished by shifting the mood to a lighthearted cooking activity. While I do see that cooking is sort of a coping mechanism for the cast, I feel like they could have cut back on the minutes dedicated to it. There are a lot of procedures in each meal they create that could have been excluded with only the highlights of the recipe shown. Also, not every problem can be simply solved through cooking which make the problems that could provide better character development look superficial. There is also the issue of the absence of mother figures in both the life of Kotori (although not literal) and the Inuzukas. The subject is often touched occasionally but never really got to be explored further which is a shame because I think it is a good thing plot-wise. The issue of divorce and how it affects Kotori\u2019s mindset towards the idea of family could have been a nice issue to be tackled with. It is implied that the Inuzukas are already past the stage of grieving but it\u2019d be nice if the show did something like coming up with the terms of loss, healing oneself through finding joy in moments shared with friends around you.\\n\\n\r\nIn the long run, Amaama to Inazuma is still a nice slice-of-life show recommended to anyone who wants something heartwarming and cute with the twist of going through gastronomic adventures by the episode. Story-wise it\u2019s not the most fulfilling one out there due to half of its content dedicated to cooking but it definitely rewards the viewer with visually appealing food, the chemistry of the cast, and its humble approach towards family.\\n",

            "content": "To sum up my review of this show, I'll give you a statement. I was shocked at how sweet this show was. Okay, bad jokes over with, now on to the review.\r\nAmaama to Inazuma, or Sweetness and Lightning (hence the bad joke prior), is a fairly relaxed slice of life that found itself debuting in a season where many other shows stole the limelight. Premiering alongside extremely popular shows like Re:Zero and Food wars, this cute show didn't get that attention it truly deserved. However this did not stop the show from shining in the eyes of many of it's viewers. I for one, absolutelyloved this show, but more on that in the Enjoyment section\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\\n\r\nAs it goes for most slices of life anime, story isn't a huge part of the show, so I will do my best to review the setting and progression in general. The story itself isn't anything spectacular; A Father loses his wife to illness(?) and finds himself having a hard time taking care of both his work and his daughter at the same time. One day, the father Inuzuka Kouhei and his daughter Tsumugi find another person struggling to find connection with others, Iida Kotori. Kouhei discovers that a fun way he can relate to Tsumugi is through the creation and eating of cooking, something his late wife was in charge of instead. The show itself covers the little adventures and happenings of the groups lives, and the different meals they create, as well as the happy times they experience together. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, each episode is fairly standalone, but the way the stories each week are presented feels very realistic. Many of the things that happen seem like things that would actually be happening in a young childs life, such as Tsumugi's constant range of emotions, even to her interactions with her classmates and family/friends. Amaama's portrayal of life for a young child feels very real, and this is something that anime as a medium of art, oftentimes runs into trouble approaching. \\n\\n\r\nOne more thing worth touching on is the lack of real conclusion of the show. The final episode really just feels like every other episode, and lacks any real finality to it. Personally I find this to be a perfectly fine approach to a more relaxed slice of life show, as it leaves the ending very open, with the possibility of more seasons, as this show could definitely go for longer (provided the budget, ofcourse).\\n\\n\r\nArt.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of Art, the show wasn't anything spectacular, but still was very clean. In terms of cooking anime, such as the ever famous Food Wars, it's animation is not nearly as flashy, but instead reflects the much more mellow mood of the show. The art is by no means poor. In fact, I thought it was one of the better looking shows of the season (that I watched of course). \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of character design, and setting, the characters aren't extravagant, and the settings aren't diverse and interesting, but they instead reflect the feel of normality and realism that the show conveys. Apart from Tsumugi and her voluptuous hair, the show itself displays itself very plainly, but still is rather pretty in it's own light.\\n\\n\r\nSound. \\n\\n\r\nSound tends to be a strange topic to approach as it encompasses a lot of pieces. I will break it down into two major chunks, those being Voice Acting\\n\r\nand Music.\\n\\n\r\nFor voice acting, I was very impressed. Amaama is one of the first shows I've seen cast an actual child (Rina Endou who is 10 as I'm typing this) to play the main role, and she did brilliantly. Tsumugi's voice was absolutely adorable, and displayed a wide range of emotions, which would prove very difficult for a young voice actress, so I do commend Rina Endou for her great work in this show. Other voice actors performed competently as well. Nakamura Yuuichi did a splendid job as Inuzuka Kouhei, and really felt at home in the role of a worried father. One of the most impactful scenes of the show, when Inuzuka sensei is looking for Tsumugi after she had left the house while he was sick, involved Nakamura shouting in a voice that conveyed true dispair and worry, and left many audience members impressed.\\n\\n\r\nAs for music, the music was fairly consistent. The opening song is quite good and cute, and all of Tsumugi's self composed songs were extremely entertaining (my favorite being the no Clump song and dance).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, I found the show fairly strong. Many slice of life shows don't put a lot of focus on character development, but I felt that Amaama did a good job at it. Tsumugi's character was immensely enjoyable and fun to watch, whether it be her silly normal self, or how she dealt with complicated emotions for a child, she remained extremely fun and enjoyable to watch throughout the whole show. Inuzuka Kouhei wasn't a terribly unique character, but he and Tsumugi both developed strongly throughout the show as their bond grew stronger and stronger. Inuzuka sensei's fairly relaxed and worrying nature reflected that of a father who truly was doing his best to give Tsumugi everything he could, despite being a widower, and allowed for his character to be very relatable and understandable.\\n\\n\r\nKotori was developed fairly well over the series as well, as she is a character who is struggling with loneliness due to her Mother's constant absence due to work. However, as she begins to interact with the Inuzuka family as well as the other minor characters, she begins to gain a better understanding of how to interact with people, and how her mother feels. Throughout the series she had a hard time dealing with her Mother's absence, but by the final episode, she has realized that her mother is doing her best, and finally gets to experience a meal with her and the new friends she's found.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, which are Yagi and Shinobu, they weren't developed very much but still had defined characters which led to interesting interactions with the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show immensely. As an anime viewer, I tend to be more serious and critical, which is reflected in my average rating statistics, but I found myself with a constant smile watching this. By no means am I a smiley person, but the sheer cuteness this show had astounded me. Tsumugi is one of the funniest and cutest characters I've seen in an anime, and I enjoyed her wacky adventures through life and food. The loving interactions of a father and his daughter are portrayed well and are extremely heartwarming to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a very fun and enjoyable anime to watch. Of course it has it's issues as every show does, but it is simply one of the most enjoyable slice of life shows I've watched. If you haven't watched it, try the first episode, because you'll fall for the show faster than you'd think.\\n\\n\r\nIf you'd like to further discuss anything, or have any questions, you are always free to add or message me. Thanks for reading the review guys and gals.\\n",

            "content": "Sweetness and Lightning is a slice-of-life title focused on widowed father and teacher Kohei and his daughter Tsumugi, who get together with one of Kohei's students, Kotori, to make delicious meals at the restaurant of Kotori's mother. The series mixes around some light humor and drama with exploring the everyday challenges that Kohei has with raising his daughter as a widowed father and establishing their current relationship with Kotori for the three to get together to learn to prepare meals.\r\nWhat makes the premise for this series work is that it strikes a balance of both being relateable to audiences thanks to Kohei and Tsumugi's domesticsituation, and the cooking component making for an immersive component thanks to the work and satisfaction that goes into cooking and eating them. With the mundane feel of the series, Sweetness and Lightning has Tsumugi believably behave for a child her age (and voiced by a child seiyuu as well) and undergo many of the typical quirks someone of her age would have such as amazement of experiencing new things. hating to eat certain vegetables, and raising tantrums if something doesn't go her way. It also believably explores the joys and challenges that Kohei can have with raising her on his own where he can lose his composure if Tsumugi misbehaves or does anything to concern him, and both of them also show signs of coping from the loss of Kohei's wife through enjoying the meals that they prepare with Kotori.\\n\\n\r\nThe cooking component of the series makes for the very heart of the series. While the premise would seem like a dull one due to the slice-of-life genre it is part of, the series offers enough focus on the developments of our trio of characters in cooking meals throughout the span of the series. Compare Kohei's skills with food preparation at the start of the series as a complete novice to how well he can manage by the end of it with the subtle improvements he has made in learning to cook. All the cooking scenes with the three show them getting satisfaction out of meal preparation and eventually able to salivate from the results of their hard work with a tasty meal. The visuals for the series also go to great lengths to show off believable detail with the food made, and make the viewer feel just as tempted to try out said prepared food.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Sweetness and Lightning made for a charming and surprisingly enjoyable slice-of-life anime thanks to the nice balance of believable focus on Kohei and Tsurugi's everyday life and the focus on their cooking sessions with Kotori. A definite recommendation for slice-of-life anime fans.",

Not that much right? Well are you expecting for his daughter to get some cancer or suddenly have superpowers,etc to make the show interesting? Well im glad they dont make this anime like that... maybe some of you have been watchbarakamon and wonder why this anime have lower score than barakamon with similar story plot... But i can assure you this anime is worth it. It doesnt as funny like barakamon but in amaama to inazuma you will see how deep a father's love for his daughter, you will see some laughs,heartwarming scene,and some struggle this anime will tell you in detail the daily life of a single parent dad who loves his little daughter.",

            "content": "I started this series because I was looking for a cooking anime. By episode 12, it had stolen my heart completely.\r\nSweetness and Lightning features a single dad, Inuzaka Kouhei, trying very much to provide for his young daughter, Tsumugi, who doesn't completely understand that mama is gone but tries every day to live without her. Does that grab your heart? Good. That's exactly what it should do, because that's human. Inuzaka-san tries to provide for his daughter, but his meals are frozen and reheated, and don't meet the Japanese standard of handmade bento - he barely knows how to handle a microwave, let alone astove and a kitchen knife. Tsumugi doesn't *mind*, but her father longs to do better for her. Now, in the United States, and across Japan, that's just life. Single parents try really hard, and don't always succeed.\\n\\n\r\nBut we get the wonderful Iida Kotori, who offers up her family's restaurant as a wholesome place to try all sorts of recipes. Kotori is afraid of knives - she has a bandage on one of her fingers for the entire series - but she consults her famous mother for recipes that will make Tsumugi happy. Kotori is more afraid of knives than Inuzaka-san, by a lot, but together they build a partnership to provide Tsumugi with handmade, wholesome meals in a safe, gentle, empowering environment.\\n\\n\r\nThe show becomes, primarily, about how Tsumugi bonds with her father in the wake of her mother's death with the help of Kotori. Kotori's best friend Shinobu, and Inuzaka-san's chef best friend Yagi, become important characters, but they very deliberately withdraw so the father-high school girl-daughter groupings can slice, dice, and cook together. At one point, Shinobu points out Tsumugi, Inuzaka-san, and Kotori and says, roughly, \"This is a treasure we need to protect,\" and they do for the rest of the series, very deliberately giving tasks to them and taking care of the grunt work when the father-daughter pair need a break. Even Yagi, who is rough around the edges but is extremely skilled in the kitchen, backs off so Tsumugi can explore the wonders of food.\\n\\n\r\nTsumugi is written and delivered as a little girl who loves food, loves her daddy, loves shoujo anime, and misses her mommy so much that it hurts. Her voice actor, Endou Rina, at only 11-12 years of age channeled the wonder, imagination, fears, love, and *tantrums* of a young child. Yes, she has adorably cute moments - the sharky-sharky-shark song is part of anime lore. But she wasn't always cute - some commentators hate this - Tsumugi flies off the handle sometimes for what seems like the stupidest thing.\\n\\n\r\nThat's actually one of the strengths of the series and of Endou Rina as Tsumugi. Tsumugi is an irrational little girl. A boy keeps teasing Tsumugi, and the anime makes clear that it's not okay and that he is punished for it by his attentive mother, but it also shows that they get along - sometimes. Her best friend hurts her feelings really badly. She cries about things that adults can handle and that adults are really confused about until they think about what she's feeling, at her age level. Her daddy speaks sharply to her (in a Japanese context; the subtitles don't really convey it all the time), and they both regret it. She breaks out into tears because of something that doesn't make sense to her, her dad, or anyone until they have a chance to talk about it. That's exactly how life was for me with my little sister after my mom died. My dad and I helped raise my little sister, with very much the same challenges - I saw those first difficult years replicated again and again in this series, including the eventual healing and the creation of new family and love structures in the wake of loss. The authenticity of Amaama to Inazuma won me over pretty early - broken families look for a place to center themselves and find a new equilibrium, and that's exactly what they did in this series.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a 1/1 adaptation from the manga, note that the romance subplot is completely excised - and I agree with it in the context of this 12-episode series. Kotori is completely focused on helping to strengthen the relationship between Inuzaka-sensei and Tsumugi in this series, and if you want to ship people you'll have to look to the manga. Sweetness and Lightning is entirely about a family attracting a community that defends the bonding of father, daughter, and high school culinary expert against all odds, and it's beautiful. It's been accused of causing diabetes because of how sweet and nice it is, and I hope you can experience the wholesome love of a single father for his little girl like I did.",

This show wants to have its cake and eat it too; it dabbles in scarce poignant moments, but never incorporates them into the narrative directly, just as triggers for empathy (we don't see anyone dealing with the issues at hand, we simply see themin the background, as if to make the life of our characters noble). \\n\r\nThe comedy is non-existent, literally, no jokes or gags other than over-the-top hacky cutesy behavior. \\n\r\nAnd last but not least, I don't see this being grounded in the reality it pretends to belong to, namely, non of the characters being anything more than one dimensional stock characters living in a world where nothing bad ever happens, never mind how many mistakes you make. It doesn't matter that you neglect your child's nutrition and non-school social life, she will be a happy-go-lucky soul; never mind that the situations you put yourself in is vastly open for cynical misinterpretation, such things don't happen.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot shake off the suspicion that this show is being mendacious.\\n\r\nIt seems to me that the director is perfectly aware of the blatantly shallow nature of the entire story, so resorting to gimmicks was all.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think there's anything missing in your life if you haven't watched this.\\n\r\nSome people definitely enjoy it, but for the \" upbeat cute kid\" element, there's Naru from \"Barakamon\" and for the \"single father\" element, there's the great \"Usagi Drop\".",

            "content": "So what happens if Shokugeki no Souma was a bit more basic and instead of fanservice was turned moe?...well here's a taste of Amaama to Inazuma.\r\nAmaama to Inazuma has a rather adorable plot due to the nature of the anime, to make good food and just to make it moe as hell with one character like Tsumugi Inuzuka voiced by Rina Endou. The premise at best are following the trend of food anime but with the unique slice of life moe twist to it and even though LA didn't have any intentions of watching this anime, LA's friend got interested so LA did to..............also becauseof Saori Hayami. What?.....\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters we actually have a rather unique set of characters, the widow father Kouhei Inuzuka voiced by Yuuichi Nakamura and his daughter Tsumugi who acts like what an actual kids sounds and acts like as well as Kotori Iida voiced by Saori Hayami the main crux of this anime trying to teach Kouhei how to cook food for Tsumugi and really even though Tsumugi is the more real-like kid, LA just couldn't get enough of Kotori in the series and probably the main reason why LA liked this anime soo much, it was most probably due to Saori Hayami's vocals...\"probably\"...\\n\\n\r\nThere are other things from Amaama to Inazuma other than the cooking however such as typical messages of family but some more daring ones later on such as Tsumugi going off in her own to help his dad that later gets more complicated to hell, in cooking terms...an adult's taste isn't obvious the same as a little kids. Amaama to Inazuma is still subtle it how it approaches it and still tries to focus more on the food than the more serious and \"unneeded drama\" it pulls. It's a slice of life cooking show with all the moe to go around...what do you expect when seeing a character like Tsumugi in an anime like this?. Amaama to Inazuma's themes is giving off the obvious eating food with your family or just people you know makes the food taste better, it later focuses more on family themes.\\n\\n\r\nThere was however one worry LA always had when watching this anime and no it wasn't the serious drama or it being \"too moe\", LA was more or less worried that Kotori would somewhat \"replace\" Kouhei's wife (a sorta of mother surrogate) due to the nature of what this anime does and that will lead it as a far too controversial topic (teacher x student issue), thankfully, LA's worry was dispelled by the end of the anime and it NEVER went there...touched upon but more on the loss of the mother than trying to replace her.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by TMS Entertainment, the character designs are pretty decent for the most part and although the backgrounding work is the mostly the same houses of Tsumugi's kindergarten to Kouhei's house  to Kotori's most of the time, the backgrounding like the character designs are decent, now the food animation instead the same quality as say Shokugeki no Souma's as it's more of homemade food than the gourmet side that Shokugeki no Souma gives us, but nonetheless the food animation is also pretty decent and like Shokugeki no Souma, the \"technical feature\" of making the food is pretty excellent in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, well it was solid throughout and even though LA's reasoning as to why LA watched the anime was for Saori Hayami (and she is LA's favourite seiyuu in this anime), props too easily goes to Rina Endou who voiced Tsumugi for this, Kouhei's voice actor Yuuichi Nakamura at best was good but better during the more rare dramatic moments but he was great in voicing a dad character. The rest of the minor voice actors are decent at best with some highlights with Shinbou Kojika voiced by Haruka Tomatsu as well as Kotori's mother Megumi Iida voiced by the ever eccentric Satomi Arai.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending if anything brings in the same format of most of the episodes given with Kouhei and Tsumugi having a squabble of some sorts, they go to Kotori's house to cook food that Tsumugi wanted (be it one they found in a restaurant or Tsumugi's kindergarten and wants to make one done by Kotori and Kouhei) and they resolve their problem with some parental guidance. It's the same typical fair and that isn't a bad thing as it is what Amaama to Inazuma does. LA was satisfied by the ending no less.\\n\\n\r\nAmaama to Inazuma has a nice concept with some homemade food and some adorable characters to add into the mix and people might find Amaama to Inazuma a bit repetitive and \"moe\" with food in the mix, heck Koufuku Graffiti even fits into this bill, but Amaama to Inazuma still has that appeal from it's characters to the whole point of the anime is for a parent who couldn't cook, learn how to cook for his daughter and Amaama to Inazuma deals with the problem of parental problems every parent deals with which helps solidifies this anime as a pretty good sit.",

            "content": "Every episode of Amaama to Inazuma is atomically engineered to melt your heart. Two of the three main characters, obviously the father and daughter, really got me whenever they interacted with each other. \r\nThe world revolves around Tsumugi because she is everything good in the world and needs to be cherished and protected at all costs. However overwhelmingly adorable, Tsumugi's character was flawless because of her flaws. Not to be written off as a perfect child, Tsumugi can also be a brat at times, allowing the viewer to relate and develop a stronger connection with her. \r\nKohei is seemingly the perfect dad for almost thesame reason. At every opportunity, he pours his heart into caring for Tsumugi in the most perfect ways possible. His daughter is his first, second, and third priority in life and that in itself fills my mouth with cavities by how sweet it is. Of course, when Tsumugi is acting like a daughter, Kohei has to act as the father. Admitting that his delivery at times can be wrong, it's visible to the viewer that his struggle of finding the balance between scolding and spoiling to be entirely real.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Iida is a great character in her own right, but even as I consider her a main character, she still takes a seat in the sidecar as Tsumugi and Kohei steal the show with their father-daughter relationship.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, overall and objectively I give the anime a 9/10, I have to personally add a +1 modifier for how much I had to physically react while watching this. It was extremely heartwarming and cute. I absolutely adore the opening. The supporting characters were great as well. The art was very standard, but what made it good was the very real expressions with the bouncy animations. And who can stand by and not make a remark on how good food looks in anime?",

            "content": "I do not understand why people are comparing this to Food Wars, the two are not similar since they are aimed at a different demographic audience. My review will be based on the fact that this is meant for older men and not for teenagers who are wanting action, fan service, or romance. Once you get through the fact that none of these will be present during the show, you might understand why I am so confused to the comparison of the two shows.\r\nTLDR : This isn't Food Wars. Stop comparing the two.\r\nSTORY : 8\r\n I cannot say that the story is the best, buthowever, it is realistic in the sense that people do take some time to move on from major events and not everyone can easily let go of memories of others. This story is very heartwarming as it shows the slow progress of going through grief and dealing with the fact that an important role in the family is now permanently gone and shows the better side of being a single parent. The story is very realistic and is actually similar to something I am currently dealing with now, so this has struck home to me.\\n\\n\r\nART : 8\\n\r\n Same thing with the story, it's not the best, but it certainly catches my attention and sometimes boggles my mind. You just have to appreciate that the father never got his daughter a haircut.... >_>\\n\\n\r\nSound : 7\\n\r\n I am not a avid listener, but it is somewhat appealing to hear some music and the sounds of cooking, even when it's a slow simmer. Nothing too special here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 9\\n\r\n These characters have their own personality and each seem like a realistic character pulled from someone's memory. Each one has their own goals and their own burden. I am not too sure how to explain each character, since I am at a loss of words, but each one is lovable in their own way. Romance isn't shown between the characters since there is a huge age difference and things would cause problems at school. This I feel is extremely realistic since \\n\r\nI deal with this at schools myself.\\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment : 10\\n\r\n Need I to explain how realistic the kids are? The students too. I wish my classrooms were a bit like these students, but I can't have it all.... can I?\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8\\n\r\n This anime is worth watching for the fun of seeing a special bond being made and having great memories being made from simple everyday actions that we do. We seriously do take the simplest things for granted. It makes you think about what things you have everyday, and what if that just disappeared. Making memories using cooking is probably the best way to show a family bond, in my opinion, and it was done extremely well. This wouldn't win a award, but it certainly will always be in my memories.\\n",

It is somewhat of a sad story, and is able to establish a good sense of realism, since it is not to far fetched.

There are always some hint of futher developpment that never arrives. The teenager with the restaurant was my favourite.

            "content": "Raising kids can be difficult, even more so when you have to raise them alone. Sweetness and Lightning is about the single father Kouhei who struggels to care for his daughter Tsumugi after his wife passed away. He really tries his best, but especially fails at cooking, so he has to buy premade meals, which Tsumugi tolerates but she misses the great cooking of her mother.\r\nThe story is told in two parts every episode. The first part is about the father and his daughter dealing with some problem, and in the second part they cook something, often something the mother used to make. So thecharacter development is limited to half of the runtime, but Kouhei, at the beginning struggeling with managing his family, becomes a man who has everything under control. Too often, the story follows a blueprint: Tsumugi is sad or mad at her father, they start cooking and she is happy again.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the shows biggest strength: Kouhei is a loving father to Tsumugi, he really cares for her and tries his best. He sometimes screams at his daughter, but he always apologizes and explains that he was just worried about her. In his conversations with the student they cook with you learn that he hardly thinks about something besides Tsumugi.\\n\r\nTsumugi is the best representation of a little girl I have seen in a while, she is obsessed with a magical girl anime, sings random songs and wants to do everything her father does. What makes her so lovable is the assistance she is to Kouhei, she helps in the household and wants everyone she knows to be happy. She can be annoying at times, but so are real little girls. Her shark song great.\\n\r\nThe last member of the main cast is a student of Kouhei, Kotori. Her mother isn't home much because of her work, so the family restaurant has to stay closed, Kotori can't cook because she is really afraid of knifes. Together with Kouhei and Tsumugi, she tries her best to learn cooking through recipes her mother writes down. There isn't much more to her character, but she likes Tsumugi and always helps to solve the conflicts between Tsumugi and her father.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is not trying to be much, but is doing a really good job of telling the story of Kouhei and Tsumugi bonding over the food they cook and eat together. It never fails to bring a smile to your face with Tsumugi being adorable or Kouhei being a good dad to his daughter. If you are searching for something light to brighten up your day, I strongly encourage you to give this show a try, while it isn't the most complex or visually stunning show, it certainly is something I really enjoyed watching.",

That's when the plot does magic and introduces yourself into an unexpected situation, from the point of view of a little girl and her father. It adds some extra characters during the episodes who add their point of view as well within a continuous story; and that's something really neat.\r\nThe story may not be complex, you could call some elements a \"plot hole\", but it makes you have a good time for sure. Perhaps, the ending will make you think \"Oh, it looks familiar to something.\"\r\n~Art > 9\r\nAboutart, all I can say is nothing: It fits the story, nothing special around it.

            "content": "I finished this anime a few days ago with a really good taste in my mouth. While most reviews keep mentioning the lack of actual story (and they are right), something about Amaama to Inazuma really hit home.\r\nStory;\r\nKouhei, whose wife passed away less than a year ago, is the father to the seriously cute, and shining Tsumugi. Being a teacher and working to provide for himself and his daughter, Kouhei is used to buying pre-made food in order to feed his daughter, having no time or experience in cooking. When he and his daughter come across a small restaurant that happens to belong to themother of one of his students, Kotori, he finds out that the place is barely any open as it used to be. Intending to leave, Kotori eventually asks her teacher to stay and help her try to cook. From there on, each episode deals with their amazing adventures of cooking delicious meals.\\n\\n\r\nAs stated before, each episode is very repetitive with no actual plot to derive the characters. You would normally see the relationship between Kouhei and his daughter at certain situations, but that is all. This could easily get boring, if not for the theme, which I personally connect to.\\n\\n\r\nArt;\\n\r\nIt started out great. Artstyle is casual like most slice-of-life anime. Tsumugi is adorable with a unique design, the teacher is pretty cute, and Kotori looks like the casual school girl. As the anime progresses, the art gets slightly choppy and quite unpleasant to see.\\n\\n\r\nSound;\\n\r\nI think it was okay. I didn't really pay much attention to the music in the background, but it was cute and fitting for the moment. Ending song is so pretty, honestly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter;\\n\r\nCharacter progression and development is easy to happen on the anime and it's done well. Kouhei eventually learns how to cook better for his daughter and himself, Kotori gets over her fear of screwing up good dishes, etc. There isn't much development or personality to expect from this kind of anime. Tsumugi is the heart of the cast and is adorable, anyone is easy to fall in love. Other side-characters appear on 2-3 episodes, and don't contribute much.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment;\\n\r\nI liked this a lot due to personal preference and relating to the subject, but otherwise, it would be very difficult for anyone else to sit through this anime. It can get easily boring, repetitive and nothing special is happening whatsoever. No actual plot, just heartwarming moments -- and that might not be enough for all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall;\\n\\n\r\nGiving this a 7. I personally really liked Tsumugi and her father, as well as Kotori and her friend. What really captured me was how the majority of their doings, and the reason they would normally gather to cook, was centered around Tsumugi's happiness. Being the small, cheerful girl without a mother that gets excited over delicious food and spending time with her father, it's easy to feel great affection towards her and the other characters, too. Otherwise, this anime is preferred to be watched when you're laying on the sofa and having nothing else to see on TV.",

            "content": "Amaama to Inazuma is a basic slice of life, it's cute and fluffy with a few slightly serious tones.\r\nThe focus on cooking and it's ties to the mother is nice, and it's got a very relaxing feel to it. I also enjoyed learning about different Japanese dishes. It's a very soft-spoken story, nothing flashy happens and there's little progression in terms of plot after the first couple episodes. That said it still manages to be interesting thanks to the characters and the food.\r\nThere's a discreet evolution in the main characters, Tsumugi is growing up and shows unrealistic but endearing maturity whilst her equally endearing fatherslowly adapts to life as a single dad. They're everyday people getting to grips with their situation as their father-daughter relationship blossoms. The supporting roles are good, they're all varied and individual but all kind and likeable. \\n\r\nThe art doesn't stand out, it's a bit too uninteresting and plain. But the way the cooking is animated it quite well done. \\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed it, the ending was good enough but not very pronounced, it didn't feel any different to the middle episode s but that's the way with many slice of life. \\n\r\nI would recommend watching it if you're looking for something sweet and relaxing.",

This would be okay if the show did not drop hints at times that deeper things are going on and then fail to deliver any answers.\r\nSo, if you are looking for something relaxing/amusing in the same vein as Usagi Drop, then this is a good one to watch. Though if you haven't seen Usagi Drop yet, I believe it is the better of the two for an all-round experience.\r\nAlso, I am currently singleand generally eat meals that can be prepared in ten minutes or less. This show made me want to expand my dietary horizons and cook more. That might be a side effect for you too.",

            "content": "If you are reading this review just to know if you should watch this show, yes, like most people would agree.\r\nSo this show, unlike the other cooking of this season (namely Shokugeki no Soma, the competitive cooking show), has a much slower pace and lack of a character development. Now that's not a bad thing, considering this is a teach-you-to-cook show, but at times you want a bit more out of a certain character, and you will be a bit frustrated.\r\nThe storyline is predictable and formulated. Something happened to Tsumugi, the father decides to cheer her up, they cook, they resolve the plot-of-the-week, they eat,the end. Very simple formula, but it works, that's what I think important. \\n\\n\r\nThe spotlight is always on the main characters, namely the cute loli Tsumugi, the father and the girl who may or may not have a crush on her teacher and also the girl who provides the father and daughter a place to cook. The side characters exist, but you don't see them most of the time. By the end of this series, nothing really happened to these characters, aside from the father getting better at cooking (SPOILERS), which is expected. I would even say that aside from the occasional mention of event of this season that you can probably jump to the second season and have no problem watching that (At the time of this writing season 2 hasn't been announced, but you know).\\n\\n\r\nNow the art is nowhere impressive, but it's coloured very lightly, and very charmingly, so it's not out of the place, but you might think this could have gotten a better artwork (That's what I think at least).\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the negative points, this show is fairly enjoyable. Because of the limited cast numbers, you put a lot of attention on the main characters, and you feel a lot more on them. Especially Tsumugi, since she is what driven the plot and what resolves a plot, basically. Also, watching this in the middle of the night is not a good idea, unless you need to cry.\\n\\n\r\nSo all in all, I hope you would try out this show, to see if you like it. I know it is lackluster in certain parts, but it is a good show nevertheless. Hopefully you find it interesting enough.",

Watch it if you're getting tired of the serious and gritty (or... the waifu wars, the moe-moe-kyun~ stuff, anything really) anim00.\r\nStory, it's sweet just like everyone said. But, if you look closely it's pretty engaging. If you see ONLY \"Tsumugi\" (the little kid), it'll be just like reading \"Yotsubato!\": cute, funny, and light-hearted. If you see the whole big picture, it's basically about a dad trying to make the kid happy after some accident that leads to the mom's dead andat the same time a high school girl trying to cook. It's fun tho, it's hella fun.\\n\\n\r\nArt, nothing to appraise, it's pretty chill, generic (duh), but it gets the jobs done. Really nice with the mood of the whole anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound, nothing special. Nice OP/ED, nice VA, so-on-and-so-forth.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, just as I said. Depends on your perspective. If you only look at the little kid like a fuckin' pedo- I mean \"loli fan\" you are, then it'll be a cute anime just like \"Yotsubato!\". IF you're like me and see the whole bigger picture, each character has their own problem to deal with... Specially the main 3.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, I FUCKIN' LOVE IT. It is \"Sweet and Lightning\" just like \"Flying Witch\", sad I'm not a fan of the OP/ED (unlike \"Flying Witch\"). Of course I would totally recommend it to y'all. Just watch it while eating your comfort food in bed, and forget everything.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's an 8 for me. The anime's nice and sweet with a tad deep sub-plot which isn't \"IN YOUR FACE\" thing.

            "content": "Food.  Food is widely regarded by many as culture, comfort, and a representation of family.  Eating with family while sharing stories over home cooked meals and cooking together are among some of the memories that can be made over the simple idea of food.  So, what happens when you take the fiery passion of cooking and the sweet gentleness of cooking at home with family?  Well, you get Amaama to Inazuma, or Sweetness and Lightning, a simple show about the recipe of family.  \r\nStory: Inuzuka Kousei is a single dad with a 5 year old daughter named Tsumugi.  Dueto health complications, Kousei is left to raise his daughter on his own after the death of his wife.  Being unable to cook, Kousei is forced to give Tsumugi frozen and already prepared meals in order to feed her.  After going to a cherry blossom viewing, the father and daughter duo meet a girl consuming an entire 3 layer bento by herself underneath a sakura tress (And yes, that is a lot of food) named Iida Kotori.  She gives them a business card saying that her family owns a restaurant, and after a set of events, sparking a healthy friendship between the two families over food.\\n\\n\r\nSweetness and Lightning follows a very simple recipe for every episode.  It first starts with a setup that sets up the day for our characters before going into a cooking segment with our three main characters before they all enjoy the meal together, sometimes with friends.  While formulaic and simple, each passing episode is a lesson involving parenthood, bonds, and the joy of being with kids, friends, and other loved ones.  \\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't much to say for the story of Amaama to Inazuma.  The story is so simplistic that only two paragraphs can really sum it up.  The only downside I can even see for this series is the fact that the show is so formulaic that if you're going into this expecting something different episode to episode aside from maybe a different recipe, than you're looking in the wrong place.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Nice simple story with a good message\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters in any slice of life series are what generally make or break a series.  No matter how lackluster the story may be, without good characters, the show will inevitably fall flat on its face.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, we have the main draw of the show, Inuzuka Tsumugi.  The 5 year old is the kind of character you would expect of a little kid of that age.  She's an excitable, imaginative little girl who can turn from really adorable with her antics to downright annoying with her tantrums and fussiness.  (Yep, just like a real child.)  The majority of the series is devoted to Tsumugi and her constant wonder into the world of food.  The joy on her face is what drives the show to delve deeper and deeper into the family moral that's so ingrained in this series that it makes you forget that she's like any other small child who fusses when things don't go her way.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's her father, Inuzuka Kousei.  As the sole remaining parent of Tsumugi, Kousei's intentions and growth in the series comes with his devotion and love for his daughter.  Like any other caring parent, Kousei's motivation in the series is to better his relationship with his daughter and provide her with all of the love and care that she needs, especially now that it's only him and he needs to act both as the mother and father.  Over the course of the series, Kousei grows along with his daughter and ends up creating this really nice father/daughter dynamic that only deepens with every passing episode.  \\n\\n\r\nFinally, we have the last of our trio of main characters, Iida Kotori.  Now, first off, Kotori LOVES food.  Like...really loves food.  An enthusiastic foodie, Kotori also suffers from mild depression since her mom is always out doing her work, leaving her to eat by herself on most days at home.  When our titular father/daughter duo comes in, Kotori comes into the picture and gradually grows alongside the other cast members and becoming in a sense, a member of the family.  She like many characters bond with Tsumugi in a way that can only bring a smile to one's face.\\n\\n\r\nSide characters are minimal in number and serve as other members around the dinner table in the second half of the series.  Aside from that, they don't really add much to the series, but they do add that friendly air that is certainly enjoyable to watch, even if they have little characteristics to make them more unique.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Enjoyable and heartwarming cast\\n\r\n-  Cast members aren't really that deep or too heavily characterized\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by TMS entertainment, Amaama to Inazuma has...a pretty average animation style.  Admittedly, there's nothing particularly interesting about this animation style aside from the generally consistency of it.  Though, the food reveal in particular should receive special mention because those scenes specifically seem to have significantly better animation than the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  Similarly, the sound for the series isn't really anything too special.  The OP is addicting and the ED is relaxing, but nothing about them stands out as extremely memorable or notable.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Amaama to Inazuma is a show that I looked forward to every week.  As a fan of slice of life, I couldn't help but smile at the happy moments that these characters were enjoying.  The pleasure of food made my heart melt when watching this series and it was definitely an adorable watch that should get more recognition.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this series?\\n\\n\r\nYes.  Amaama to Inazuma is one of my favorite series from the Summer 2016 season and definitely had me gripped in these touching family affairs that the characters had.  They seemed to genuinely have fun cooking, and while it wasn't any Shokugeki with the kinds of foods that they were presenting, nothing beats a nice home-cooked meal.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nTsumugi's tantrums.  Admittedly, no one likes a child acting up, and there's no escaping the sad fact that adorable children have a dark side to them, so it's not really a flaw on the series at all.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a show that's sweet with a bit of a melancholy bitter flavor, than Amaama to Inazuma is the show for you.  The show is formulaic, so expect to be basically seeing the same kind of thing over and over again on an episode to episode basis, but if you can get past that, you're in for a really nice and flavorful ride.",

            "content": "Amaama to Inazuma is an anime where you will find a peculiar story and something \"original\" oriented more towards people who like culinary animes and slice of life.\r\nThe story begins with a good introduction of the situation but loses interest as it progresses until it becomes a cooking manual (literally) where the characters cook and cook and cook and cook ...., beyond that does not have an order for the history. As Slice of life does not offer much, although his level of comedy is acceptable.\r\nThe art is average but it reaches to whet your appetite when you watch the characters cook, it is notvery good idea to see this anime on an empty stomach.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good, a well done Opening with a cheesy but sticky musical background and a slow and quiet Ending. The sounds within the story are so difficult to perceive that surely the only thing you will remember in the end will be Tsumugi singing the songs of Magi-Girl.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have opposite scores, on the one hand we have sweet Tsumugi, the kawai girl who stars in the funny situations and who is the center of attention of all.\\n\r\nHe is also his father kouhei who is a high school teacher who seeks to overcome the death of his wife, who then goes looking for the help of Kotori to learn to cook.\\n\r\nKotori, her student, is a somewhat lonely girl with an irrational fear of kitchen knives who is in the middle of the divorce of their parents (as I saw in the Manga), at the end ends up filling a little the void left by Tsumugi's mother .\\n\r\nThe other two characters Shinobu and Yagi do not have much participation.\\n\\n\r\nEven so I could partially enjoy the story, but surely there will be people that if they like to cook (I do not like much) that they will be able to enjoy much more of this anime CULINARY.",

I really enjoyed this anime because of how cute, fun, and entertaining it was.  There were some moments of feels, but this is such a feel good show.  It was perfectly timed for the season that it came out because there were anime such as Re:Zero and others that were so dark.  You could just watch it after those shows and you'd feel so much better lol.  For me the characters were probably the best part aboutthis show, and it reminded me a lot of Barakamon (if you haven't seen it, check it out).  The characters all had such fun and different personalities that really drove the show.  I wish that there were some more episodes and that some more of the characters' backgrounds were shown, but overall this was a very enjoyable and fun show.",

Despite those elements, this is a show you watch for the development and struggle of a single father who goes from raising his daughter on frozen dinners to learning to cook for her sake. That is really the oversimplified version of it, but it's fairly hard to explain the heartwarming story that comes from that premise.\r\nArt 10/10: I still stick by not being an art critic, so my main point here is that THIS SHOWWILL MAKE YOU VERY HUNGRY.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: The dad, Kouhei, is a great character who goes through wonderful development as a single father who needs to learn to take care of his young daughter. His daughter, Tsumugi, is perfect, my friend and I are still fighting over custody for her. The only reason I gave this category a 9 is because in his journey to learn how to cook, he is also learning with one of his students, Kotori, who is the daughter of a famous chef and just has a semi-flat character. Other than the big three of this show, the side characters are pretty nice and amusing as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall 10/10: in this uncommon case, these two categories can be combined because their points are pretty much the same: Tsumugi is the most precious child ever and impossible not to love; the show is heavily based on character development since there is no end goal of it all and it does a wonderful job at that; and finally, people can learn a couple of cooking tips from the show and that is always a nice bonus when you can take something away from it all.  Final note, I found myself randomly crying at points, so be prepared for that as well.",

            "content": "Ammaama to Inazuma\r\nStory:\r\nWe start off with my biggest critique point of the show, which is the story. It begins with Kouhei Inuzuka. He is a teacher and lost a couple of months before the story started his wife, with which he had a pre-school daughter Tsumugi. Since his wife took care of most of Tsumugi's needs Kouhei is rather lost and doesn't know how to take care of a child. This starts at rather basic things like cooking. So one day Inuzuka takes Tsumugi out to the park where they met Kotori Iida one of Kouheis students. After a few events Kotori gives the twoof them Kotori invites the two of them to come to her mothers restaurant. However when they arrive there Kotori is the only one there since her mom is quite the busy person. Since her mother isn't their Kotori wants to cook, but isn't as good as her mother. Still Sensei and Tsumugi are satisfied and Kouhei asks Kotori, if he could learn how t cook from her. She agrees and with being said, we have the setup for the plot.\\n\\n\r\nAfter this point the story goes on in an episodic fashion. Something with Tsumugi happens at the start of the of the episode. Some episodes couple this with a bit of drama and then they cook afterwards.\\n\r\nWhile I don't mind episodic shows in general, the repetitiveness of the show really started to bore me at some point. They never changed the formula at the start and a huge part of the show was focused around the cooking.\\n\r\nThis is in my eyes a double-edged sword. On one hand the food making process was definitely nice to see and also the realism they brought to it was nice. Another positive aspect of this was that they steadily increased the complexity of the dishes, which made it feel like there was a certain amount of growth in Kouhei's abilities. On the other hand the part where they cooked took always around half the episode which did not allow for more complex settings. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I also missed was a clear red line in terms of development besides the cooking. Most of the development was done in early episodes and so the characters became a bit stale later on in the \\n\r\nshow. Especially Kouhei could have had a lot more emotional development over the course of the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the stronger points of the show. They did an excellent job at the start to make most of the characters relatable. They also had a lot of nice development in the first 3-4 Episodes to make the viewer grow attached to them. Also a strong point of the show is that they did not expand the cast to ridiculous numbers, but kept it to the minimum of the 3 main characters and 2 reappearing characters which were the best friends of Kotori and Kouhei.\\n\\n\r\nWith the 3 main characters we first of have Tsumugi which serves as the cute doll character. Believe  me when I say she fits this role perfectly. At some points she is on a diabetes Type-II level of cute which is really good. Besides that, most of the episodes revolve around her and the things that she does or likes, for example stuff that happens at pre-school or vegetables she does not like. Overall Tsumugi is the main driving force of this show and Kouhei and Kotori play around her for the most part. Besides her cuteness she has the basic childish traits, but also has quite the dominant personality for a child. She is also outgoing and tries to help with the cooking and other things as best as she can. What I also wanted to mention is that her seiyuu did a good job in voicing her for a 11 year old.\\n\\n\r\nKouhei, her father, is a more timid person in comparison. The loss of his wife really did affect him quite hard. So even after some time has passed, he still thinks a lot about her and what she would do in certain situations. His timid personality gives also the impression that he never wants to burden anyone. The biggest part that the death of his wife affect for him was however that he now needs to take care of Tsumugi and manage his job as a teacher at the same time. That is the reason why he is at first overwhelmed by the tasks at hand. However since he really cares a lot about the well being of Tsumugi he tries his hardest to manage everything and fill in the spot of his wife.\\n\\n\\n\r\nKotori is one of Kouheis students at school and her mom has a small restaurant, but due to her mother being famous she rarly is in the restaurant and more on her TV show. That is the reason why Kotori is most of the time alone at home or in the restaurant and there are no customers. When she meets the Inuzukas for the first time she is really happy, because of their company and gladly accepts Kouheis question of learning to cook from her. This is because of the two she does not need to stay alone anymore when her mom is gone. From all the characters I liked her the most in the show, because of her kind and caring nature, besides that she was also quite funny. That includes her beeing scared of knives to the point of not even touching them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound/Art/Animation:\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are mediocre at best, there were some inconsistencies here and there. Also the locations was most of the time the restaurant so you had no impressive places to see and no stellar artwork. The character models were also generic. Compared to the visuals the Soundtrack was much better. Most of the OST was fitting and improved the scenes it was used in. If we look at the Opening and Ending I have to admit I liked the Ending more than the Opening. Sure the Opening was upbeat, catchy and colorful however, for me personally I liked the calmer approach of the Ending a lot more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment/Conclusion:\\n\\n\r\nWith everything said now I did enjoy this show for most parts. The cooking parts looked realistic and the characters were likeable so it wasn't bad. However since this show is not the first of its kind I need to compare it to others. The first two shows that come to mind are obviously Usagi Drop and Barakamon. Compared to those two Amaama to Inazuma has a lot of issues, especially with the pacing. It becomes very repetitive after around the 5th Episode and every following episode seems interchangeable. So for me its like that. If you want to see an entertaining show you watch Barakamon, if you want a show with more character growth you watch Usagi Drop and if you have seen those two already you can watch this show. So Amaama to Inazuma is in the end not a waste of time, but also nothing special.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Do you like slice of life? Do you like repetitive stories? Do you like bland, flat characters? If you answered yes to any of these questions, congratulations! Heres the anime for you!\r\nSo, the concept of atm is that a father named Kohei, who just lost his wife 6 months ago, can't cook meals for his daughter, tsumugi, so they buy packaged meals from a store. However, one of koheis students, iida, is the daughter of a famous chef lady. Together, they all cook meals together!!! The story sounds very interesting at first, but unfortunately, something ruins it completely:\r\nREPETETIVENESS!!! Yeah, this may seem like a bitof a spoiler, but almost every episode has the same exact concept. No, I take that back. Every episode is the exact same, except for what food they're cooking. For a few episodes, its not a real issue, but eventually, you slowly realize this. Another issue with the story is that, they always tried to avoid the emotional issues of losing the mother. And no, this isn't an issue because I was expecting it to be emotional before watching. Its because the first episode set up this kind of mood, and it rlly worked. I would say the emotional moments (while very few of them) were the shows best.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good. Not perfect, but it overall looks nice, and makes the character designs stand out.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, on the other hand, gets pretty annoying. Its repetitive, just like the show. Literally in each episode, after they finish cooking, that same annoying tune plays again. This is rlly saying something, as usually I don't give much attention to soundtracks. The voice acting, on the other hand, was average, tho it got annoying at times.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters? Well, they were all forgettable. None of them got any development. Not even firkin Kohei. In the beginning, well he doesn't know what hes doing, and in the end, its still kinda like that. Tsumugi starts out very cute, but after a few episodes, she gets quite annoying. Iida has gotta be one of the worst characters iv ever seen. Shes rlly annoying, and has this 'fear of knives' that is never explained. Honestly, no other characters are rlly worth mention. \\n\\n\r\nWatching this series is INCREDIBLY BORING, too. Like, do the creators rlly think we wanna watch them cook the entire time?\\n\\n\r\nWell, I'm basically done talking about this show now. Just gonna give it a 3 because it sucks and the fact that  chose to finish this is one of the worst mistakes I have ever made in my whole life",

            "content": "TL;DR at the end\r\n~Contains Spoilers~\r\n Children are an interesting topic of discussion. Most people have their own general opinion on whether they're good or bad, annoying or cute, and worth the trouble or not. One of the things I like about Amaama to Inazuma is that it showcases both sides of children, and overall just comes of as really realistic. It feels like your witnessing the growth of a life. Or it would, if Tsumugi actually learned from her mistakes.\r\n________________________________________\r\nSTORY: 5/10\r\n Originally, Amaama to Inazuma started out extremely entertaining. Comedy, drama, cooking, adorableness, the whole package was there. But then... it happened again. And again.And AGAIN. Essentially, the show literally repeats the same formula for nearly every episode. By about the halfway point, it was boring.Tsumugi constantly having spats with her bratty friends, which in turn transforms her into a brat. They make food to cheer her up, she apologizes to her friends, all is well until next week. New characters are introduced along the way, but the core elements of the plot never change. \\n\r\n_______________________________________\\n\r\nART: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are just below average. Nothing worse you can say about it, it's not repulsive or anything. But it's definitely NOT good. The movement looks weird at points, and the art style is too fluffy and childish. It might have been the intention but it doesn't change the fact that it looks bad.\\n\r\n______________________________________\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are pathetic. They set the tone for the series well, sure, but they aren't pleasant to listen to AT ALL. Both aren't something you listen to more than once, if you even give it the courtesy. The OST is the same case, but it's completely different in context because it only plays in the background. It carries the mood instead of solely trying to set it. The sound effects are barely there and don't contribute much. Still though, that would have given sound an average score. So why the seven? Well, the reason I started the series in the first place is because two of my favorite voice actors voice the main characters. Needless to say, they did a fantastic job as usual. Tsumugi, as well, sounded REALLY good. It's stupefying that the staff went out of their way to get a child voice actor on board with the project. The supporting cast isn't as good or memorable, but the main characters have a fine footing all by themselves.\\n\r\n______________________________________\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nJust having a good voice doesn't make a character good though. First off, I'll start by saying the character design isn't the standout part of this group. But that doesn't matter that much, honestly. Neither do most of the characters. They all exist to popularize Tsumugi and that's it. Unfortunately, the chance you'll get annoyed with Tsumugi is high, but that's exactly why the other characters exist. For every character that fails, they have a backup plan, and I appreciate that. \\n\r\n______________________________________\\n\r\nTL;DR: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n+Unique, very unique story. Not a concept you've seen more than once, if ever\\n\r\n+Decent OST\\n\r\n+Great voice acting\\n\r\n+Overall Good balance of characters\\n\r\n-Story is repetitive\\n\r\n-Looks bad\\n\r\n-OP and ED are bad\\n\\n\r\nAmaama to Inazuma is certainly an experience. It's definitely not a must watch all around but it certainly is for fans of slice of life. It does so many things right and yet so many wrong.  In the end, good outweighs the bad, but not by too much. If nothing else, it should serve as a getaway from all the moe high school comedies that dominate today's lineups. Here's to more like it in the future.\\n",

            "content": "The show captured real life situations in the real world. Similar to Usagi drop, this series revolves around a child and a parent living independently. However, it had so much to offer than just familial bonds.\r\nWhat makes this series stand out is its detail to its characters. They're not so special, but that's what makes them so detailed. In a slice-of-life series, it's always important to make the characters as realistic as possible, and this series did just that. An example of this is Tsumugi, who represented what an actual toddler would act like. The animation label did all that they can to make herseem very much like a 6 year-old. They had a child voice actor, replicated the movements and habits of kids, even the expressions made were very childish. In short, they made the most realistic character without forgetting that it's just an anime.\\n\\n\r\nTsumugi also represented the show itself. As it is called Sweetness and Lightning, we see an adorable side to her and also an energetic and irritating side to balance it out.\\n\\n\r\nThe title pretty much sums up the whole show, in more ways than one. It strikes you with its moe factor and hits you in the feels like lightning!",

            "content": "It feels like yesterday when I was a kid myself. There would be specific kinds of food that I really loved and I hated. Since I am from a Greek family, the one thing I hated when I was young was liver. Whenever I heard the word liver, my face would change into that of disgust. As a kid, I sometimes also said mean things that I did not actually understand that they affect the others around me. We all had moments as children when we were naughty and we did something so terrible that we got scolded by our parents. Let's be honest nobodylikes to be scolded or even punished. Now that I have grown up, I understand that everything they do is for none else but us and they love us so much that they want to help us become good people in the future and that is why they can be very strict in order to make us understand where there is a limit.\\n\\n\r\nAmaama to Inazuma reminded me a lot about my childhood memories and Tsumugi is for most of the time an example of how some of us were as kids. I love the fact that the show is not story-driven but character-driven since I have more time to grow with the characters and understand their thoughts. Although the show is fairly short (only 12 episodes), I really felt connected with the show and it managed to touch my heart. The story that Amaama to Inazuma wants to convey to the audience is not anything grandiose or pseudo-intellectual as many shows. But, it is fairly simple and direct. It is about a family of a widowed man and his daughter who cook together with one of his students and their daily lives. Cooking becomes actually a fundamental component of the series since most resolutions of any difficulties or problems in the show are found while cooking. The parenting aspect is there but also not there at the same time. It was not given as much focus as the cooking, but with 12 episodes it is to be expected. One particular scene that struck me was when Tsumugi wanted to play the role of Mr. Galigali and her friend was weirded out by her behaviour. It is such a common phenomenon today for kids to be excluded because they have different opinions or likings than most of the other kids. Our societal norms affect immediately kids more than anyone else. This kind of exclusion is becoming more common in early grades since kids are taught to think in one way and anything that goes against it they either find it weird or ignore it. As a kid I was different and that had also been a case of causing some kids to bully me or laugh at me. As a kid, I was very chubby and shorter than other kids and I was getting teased for being fat. Looking at that scene, it showed me that kids usually do that not clearly understanding that the things they do or say may hurt the others around them. \\n\\n\r\nI could speak about this topic for ages but since I want not to tire anyone who reads this review I will move along. The characters in the show are all likable but the one that you could have guessed that he/she stood out was Tsumugi. She is a little kid that brings joy to everyone that watches her cute mannerisms. I felt like I was tasting white chocolate when I was watching Tsumugi. She is too sugary and sweet, but you cannot help but like her. At some point you may feel that the cuteness is wrapping completely your body but thankfully this has not happened to me. Unfortunately, there are not many things I can say about the other characters, except Tsumugi's dad. He reminds me of my father from his caring and loving nature, but also from his strictness. However, Tsumugi's dad's wife has died before the show started and he has to deal with all the parenting by himself. I supported him when he scolded Tsumugi for her behavior and I felt happy for him when everything went well and smoothly between him and Tsumugi. He shows what kind of parent I would want to be in the future and how I would grow up my kids. I would show them my love in any way I could, but when they act wrong, I will scold them and show them that their behavior is not appropriate. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the art and animation, it is good. It fits the show and makes food look delicious in a heartwarming way, in comparison to the over-the-top orgasmic look in Shokugeki no Souma, another cooking anime. It reminded me of having a family dinner with my own family.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack overall was decent but unmemorable. It did not act against the show but it did not enhance the experience either. However, the ED song \"Maybe\" was the only track that stood out to me. It was warm and fuzzy just like the whole vibe of this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is very meditating and relaxing. It is exactly what I need after a hard day and it warms my heart in many ways and brings the feeling of nostalgia. I am very pleased that I finally watched this show to its end. I had it on-hold from last summer and I feel so happy and sad that it ended. If you want a show that is relaxing and touching, this is the show for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.12/10\\n\\n\r\nAlternative Recommendations:\\n\r\n-Udon no Kuni no Kiniro Kemari for the heartwarming feeling although not to the extent of Amaama to Inazuma.\\n\r\n-Blind Recommendation: Usagi Drop\\n",

It is not great but, it is a good anime to pass time and enjoy while watching.\r\nThe enjoyable part here is seeing the relationship between Tsumugi and her father grow.\r\nThe characters are not rich in personality or story.

It's always a new day where Tsumugi goes to school and then come home to tell her father child school stuff, a fight with a friend a paintingthey made.

            "content": "Sweetness & Lightning is an example of a very well made story about the difficulties, struggles, and even happiness through learning experiences in a single parent household. The relationship between a single father and his young daughter brought many emotions, albeit for good reasons.\r\nStory 9/10: Firstly I would like to state that this anime can seem very episodic. There isn't a vast amount of detail invested into a big plot or anything of the sort. Even though this may seem like a negative aspect, Sweetness & Lightning's story had me intrigued. The father, Kouhei Inuzuka, is a high school teacher and single father to hisdaughter, Tsumugi. Together they find an interest in cooking different foods, some of which Tsumugi's mother had made before she passed away. An important part to my rating for the story is due to the age Tsumugi is, which is 5 or 6 years old. Around that age is very important in life due to new experiences such as school, beginning the process of growing up, and learning many new things. This anime showed what I would consider a very realistic depiction of how a 5 or 6 year old would act given the circumstances.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: I'm not a huge critic on art unless I'm being promised a phenomenal amount of detail and crazy effects, so my rating will be a standard 8 here. I would like to point out that although the art style is standard for todays production quality, specific detail was put into some of the foods created. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: This is a very laid-back and relaxing anime, so there wasn't an immense amount of effort put into the soundtrack. The opening and ending songs were pretty good, and fit the emotion of the story for the most part. Pretty much your standard OP/ED. Background music was also pretty standard.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: I found the connection and relationship between Kouhei and Tsumugi very strong and particularly unique. Their bonding through cooking food seems mundane at first but both have fitting personalities for each other, and it was surprising to see the development between the two. Side characters all had their influences to the story overall and didn't feel like unnecessary \"extras\", except for two. Their brief involvement was forgettable up until this moment so I consider them irrelevant. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: Laid-back yet still entertaining? Check. Characters with good personal qualities and behaviors? Check. Honestly in a broader sense, there isn't anything spectacular about this anime, it's a pretty basic show. If that's something you're looking for, then consider my points above, and maybe you will find it enjoyable as well!\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: I feel like this show really only appeals to a nich\u00e9 of a nich\u00e9, those who want a laid-back anime that requires almost no attention. But if you do pay attention, you'll find a truly appealing anime inside a seemingly mundane plotline.\\n\\n\\n",

The first episode already sent me crying from the father's struggles to raise a kid, and sent a heart warming vibe all throughout the series.  Many people may see this as a boring. slice of life anime where characters get together and make/eat food. The character development was a bit disappointing with Kotori, but since I have not seen the manga so she might be able overcome her fears in the future. Overall, this is a warm, fluffy anime with some lightning on theside, kind of like drinking hot coco in the snow.",

This is perfect for every age!\r\nSpoiler Free?: Going through EP 1 and small spoilers throughout though this anime hardly has ay spoilers. \r\nRead Manga: Yes (Because some things are resolved or explained)\r\nBest Character: Kouhei Inuzuka (And low key- Mikio )\r\nPros: Depression healer and.. if you need to smile... Also they represented what being  a kid was like very well.\r\nCons: Unsatisfying ending\r\n\u2665\r\nHave you ever wanted to be a kid again? Or have you ever wanted to know what it feels like to be an adult? Well this anime goes through both of those. \r\nThe anime shows the struggles of being a single fatherdoing his best to make his kid happy. \\n\r\nThrough the first episodes it made me smile ear to ear remembering how I was like when I was a kid. Tsumugi's  was really well written out and it gave me a new age for a character. Tsumugi's character almost seemed like a father or a kid wrote this while adding details on what their kid would do or what they would do. Literally, this is the most purest character I've ever witnessed. When being a kid you can go through emotions faster than shuffling through a deck of cards and some pepole got annoyed on how bratty she seemed like. She is a kid and I'm sure every kid was somehow bratty. \\n\r\nInuzuka's character was really interesting to watch and since I'm an empathetic person I would randomly break down only thinking about what he's going through. He is being a strong father for his daughter. 6 months ago he lost his beloved wife and he decided he would be #BestDad for his daughter. He started connecting to his daughter through one things she loves, Food.\\n\\n\r\nPassing that, I loved seen the characters bond over something we all like (I think? I mean if you don't like it.. er.. sorry?) Food. Watching Inuzuka as a father and watching him improve to make his daughter happy is so fricking pure to my dark soul. When making the food it isn't really interesting to watch but it showed the basics of cooking. Food Wars made the cooking very interesting.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was really good to! Like damn!\\n\\n\r\nThere is somethings I want to happen:\\n\r\nTsumugi to understand that her mom is never coming back. \\n\r\nInuzuka to marry Kotori's mother because why not?\\n\r\nI need to see Tsumugi grown up. \\n\r\nKotori to become a master chef. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is surely something you need to watch and really get into it.\\n",

It is also about expectations of each other, as a daughter and as a father. There is conflicting views throughout this story and hardships which are resolved because of their strong bond.

Also explores some parts of Tsumugi's past during the time of her mother prior to her death.\r\nCHARACTERS\r\nKohei: High school teacher. He's not very good at cooking. He is a bit of a pushover but is always happy. Plus, as you can see... he is a widow.\r\nTsumugi: Preschool/Kindergarden who is full of life and cuteness. \r\nKotori: High school student. She is shy, novice in cooking and has bad knife skills. \r\nOVERALL:\r\nIt's one of my favouriteanimes during the summer. There is a lot of smiles and heartbreak. I get to learn new recipes every week. Seeing Tsumugi growing up is just remarkable -- I feel connected to the character.",

            "content": "As the first 3 episodes aired i thought to myself \"wow, maybe this one could be my favourite from summer season\". But no, i was wrong. \r\nAmaama to Inazuma is a really sweet anime, the characters are honestly so cute! But it had one big problem in my opinion, here's why: \r\nStory: The point here is that this anime has no plot at all, wich i think is fair since it's a slice of life but c'mon they could've done better. As a i said, the first episodes were great and so heart warming! i even watched one with my dad and he loved it,but then as the episodes kept airing they did the same for every single episode!! they just cooked, that's literally all they did. And i would like to say it's \"realistic\" but unless you're a chef or something i don't think anyone's life or happiness revolves around food, but don't get me wrong this anime has his own charm, is really really sweet at times and i think any person despite their age can enjoy it, even though is not a masterpiece or something. It became boring because the episodes all ended the same way but honestly it had really cute and tear-jerking parts.\\n\\n\r\nArt: One of the things i liked the most about this anime is the art! is really cute and it really fits the story. The characters design is cute as well. Especialy the little kids, they are adorable. Also they things they cooked looked delicious so i was always hungry while watching this anime lol.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack was ok, the opening was ok too but the ending was oh my god, that ending is really good, i love Brian The Sun and i'm always happy to hear them. The voice acting was cool and the fact that Tsumugi's Seiyuu is actually a little girl blew my mind, i loved that. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As i said, the characters are really sweet, another thing that i loved about this anime was the characters, they were adorable but at the same time nothing special. \\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nThis is a sweet anime and if you like slice of life go ahead and watch it, but if you're not into SoL maybe is better to avoid it since it may seem that this anime is going nowhere, although i think that's exactly the appeal this anime has but i'm not that much into that type of anime but i'm sure fans of slice of life out there will enjoy more than i did. This anime is good i hae to say it but definitively won't rewatch it again and i don't think i would recommend it to people.",

            "content": "Oh boy here we go. Hold on to your butts boys and girls this roller coaster is about to get emotional. \r\nI think I'm more biased to liking this anime as I'm at that point in my life that I'm getting married and expecting my first child, so I'm more drawn towards Inuzuka, Kouhei (the father) as I understand his worries and fears about raising his child alone. Wanting to give her the discipline shes requires without driving her away and trying to find time to make her a proper meal. Then there is Inuzuka, Tsumugi (the daughter) who is always trying to have ahappy face but is hurting inside a lot if she remembers not having her mother. Which in one episode drove me to tears, the only other anime which has made me cry was Full moon wa Sagashite so good job.\\n\\n\r\nThe story overall doesn't centre around food like what a lot of people think it does. A food anime goes into a lot about food with different cultures, umamai levels, ect but Amaama to Inazuma doesn't. It's not a food anime, it centres around the bond between father and daughter with the use of preparing food.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy a very good story with great characters and a smile at the end of every episode, except one; you will cry at the end of one episode, then this anime is for you. No over baring plot, no mass evil that needs defeated. Just a simple story about a father and daughter.",

            "content": "Amaama to Inazuma (Sweetness and Lightning)\r\nArt/Characters: The art style in this show can really only be described in one word: Cute. There is just something about this show\u2019s style that makes it blur the line between cute and serious. There are a few things that I am not a fan of in principle, such as the exaggerated hair on Tsumugi, but those things are pretty minuscule when it comes to the overall art of the show. One of the things that are really well done would be the way that the food is portrayed. Because this is a show about food it just goes tosay that the food should look good enough to eat, and that is exactly what happened throughout this show, every episode ended with me hungry. As for the characters themselves, I felt that they had a healthy depth to them that made them easy to watch. There are a few things that don\u2019t really makes sense, like how a grown man has trouble with a knife and what exactly is the backstory, but more on that later. Tsumugi is a cute and fun protagonist that showcases what it really means to discover and experience things for the first time. Her father, Kouhei, is a perfect portrayal of the loving father who just wants the best for his daughter. Kotori, the high school student of Kouhei\u2019s, really is something out of left field for me. But her love of food is something that I can easily relate to.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music: SO CATCHY. I love listening to these tracks time and time again because of how much fun I have just grooving to them. A good show knows when to be bubbly and happy, and in a show like this one, things can often get a little to over-bubbly and there is a loss of meaning in that joy. But not here, the sound director knew exactly what they were doing, and were able to create an atmosphere of joy, and importance in my heart. The music played in the background was even interesting and fun. The use of wind instruments along with a piano is a small change that gives a huge reaction. The sounds of the food as well! When there is meat going on the stove, we HEAR the sizzle. It looks great and it sounds great. And I am sure if I made it myself, it would be just as amazing. I was really brought into the restaurant as a welcomed guest with these sounds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: Kouhei Inuzuka is in a pretty rough patch of his life. With his wife recently passing away and his young daughter, Tsumugi, is solely his responsibility. The main struggle so far has been food. He isn\u2019t much of a cook and makes mostly TV dinners for Tsumugi. She eats them every night and doesn\u2019t complain, but he can see it on her face that she wants something more. On the whim of a coworker, he takes Tsumugi to a restaurant that is a little off of the beaten path that is run by one of his student\u2019s mother. Unfortunately the mother isn\u2019t there, but Kotori does her best to feed them what they would like. Kouhei learns that Kotori\u2019s mother isn\u2019t there often and because of this she often eats alone. After some quick thinking, Kouhei and Kotori begin to learn to cook fun and delicious food for all three of them. As the show progresses the food gets more and more interesting and friends of both Kotori and Kouhei join the cooking party!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Reflection: Call me crazy, but I am a sucker for stories about Dad\u2019s beating the odds for their kids. That is the kind of dad that I want to be whenever I have kids. The Story of a father doing his absolute best that he knows how to make his daughter happy, and then choosing to cook with one of his students because he knows that it will make her happy just warms my heart. They cook a variety of meals that all look and sound delicious. I often want to make the meals that they make in the show, but often the recipes are missing something and I can\u2019t. The characters are cute and fun to watch and it\u2019s fun to experience things with them. There is an episode where Tsumugi runs into some trouble with her friend, but her dad is right there ready to help in any way possible, and the solution that he comes up with is just priceless. All that being said; there was a lack of true story. While episode by episode had a common theme, there was nothing overarching the entirety of the show to pull it all together. There was a main problem, food, and they solved it in each episode. While I love shows that are able to have this kind of \u201cyou-can-miss-an-episode\u201d type of vibe, I really think they could have developed it better. If the source material provides it, I would love to see a second season. Maybe it is just me wanting to be a dad and seeing someone succeed so well makes me so happy, but the show left me wanting to watch these characters grow more. Amaama to Inazuma is a fun, lighthearted show about a dad just wanting his daughter to be happy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 8.5/10",

            "content": "Sweetness & Lightning (Amaama to Inazuma) is mediocre on the surface. Despite the simplicity of it's plot and animation, it remains an experience that I would easily recommend to anyone - especially those who enjoy slice of life series. It is an interesting take on the genre as a whole and remains very grounded to reality; as a result, the atmosphere of the series is very close to the real world. It truly encapsulates the essence of familial interactions wonderfully.\r\nThe story revolves around a father and his daughter (aged anywhere from 3 to 6 years old - it is never directly specified), named Kohei (whohappens to be a high school teacher) and Tsumugi respectively. Kohei is burdened with raising the child by himself as his wife's death had occurred 6 months chronologically before the beginning of the series - the foundation for the series is laid when he stumbles upon a student of his; this student's mother is incidentally a semi-acclaimed chef who owns her own restaurant. After this is all explained, the remaining episodes follow a basic core plot - Tsumugi wants to eat something after a certain event has occurred that makes her want to do so (i.e, a fishing trip leads to her wanting to eat fish), and then the main cast prepares this certain food. It is very basic in it's premise, but never does it feel repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the series is riddled with mediocrity in many instances, but is generally consistent in quality that manages to stay up to par with other modern anime series. The series suffers from a bad case of static backgrounds with some motion in the foreground, so often times, when characters are drawn in the background, it often feels less lively as they tend to remain static most of the time. Regardless, it always manages to look nice, despite the simplicity of the character designs.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is not memorable - it's very simple and quite common relative to other slice of life shows. The openings and endings are distinct and don't suffer from the generic openings that clout the genre. That being said - there is not much else to say on the topic. The soundtrack is consistently bland, and it doesn't add nor does it take away to the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, though few in numbers, are very memorable and distinctive in their own right - they are all enjoyable and work to benefit the series as a whole, as they are the main draw to it. The relationships between the characters are realistic, but what blew me away was how well the series managed to encapsulate children - notably, Tsumugui. The show is extremely heart-warming and is definitely recommendable.",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, although there is absolutely nothing to spoil. I'll get into that later.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nThe story has some problems with it. Again, this will contain \"spoilers\", although 90% of this information is given by the 2nd or 3rd episode. First off is the entire story itself. Making food for your daughter is not enough to make a solid anime, and it shows. About every episode follows some sort of template like this: Dad feels bad because he wants to give his kid good food, he makes good food with a high school girl, she eats the food and likes it. Just about everyepisode is that. I think there should've been more focus on actual story, maybe with the mother that died as mentioned early on but never really again. This whole anime should've been an episode of a bigger story, not the main story itself. \\n\r\nOh and also even though the tags in MAL (and kiss anime) say it's a comedy, there is no \"real\" comedic value or effort put into it. Maybe if you find a little kid dancing funny then it's a comedy?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\r\nEverything looks okay, just normal. Nothing special at all but it isn't \"bad\", although they'd have to try to make it \"bad\". I am gonna complain about the over usage of CGI cars though, they extended a transition scene just to toss some CGI cars in it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 3/10\\n\r\nThe OP is forgettable, I didn't even listen to the ending because I don't care enough to, but that is not why I rate it low. All of the songs played during the anime sound very basic and sound like stock music. I'm not saying it is stock music, but it has that feel to it. Again, not enough to make it a 3. During certain scenes, you can hear fairly loud background noise from the mics, and it cuts on and off as the talk (they cut out the background noise when they're not talking, but you can hear it when they are). It feels like they were in a rush to get these out at the last second or something, I have no other idea why they did this with only a select few scenes. It's not hard to really mess up sound, so when you do it really hits hard.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nThe reason I gave it a 4/10 instead of a 2-3/10 is because there actually is an interesting character, and she's basically a side character (although listed as main). The father, Kouhei Inuzuka, has absolutely 0 development as a character at all. The only reason he exists is to fill in the roll of a father for the girl. He is so plain and normal as a character that they even mention it in the anime! I'm sure if you met him in real life he'd seem like a nice guy and a good parent but guess what, this is an anime. If you don't have interesting characters then the audience is going to get bored. Next up is Tsumugi Inuzuka, the daughter of Kouhei Inuzuka and his dead wife who's named is not mentioned.  She has about as much character as any other kid you could think of for an anime. She's generic, although better than plain. But it's a problem when the 2 main characters feel like side characters. Last character I will go into is Kotori Iida. She is the reason I raised any points up at all. She is considered a \"main character\" by MAL, although she really is a side character. She has the most personality and character out of anyone in the whole anime. She has development, although it may be as weak as a fear of knives (which is never shown why she is), it still brings new personality. Also I just want to point out that I really like her crumbed up smile, kind of reminds me of that nostalgic crumbled charlie brown smile. \\n\r\nDidn't mean to go on characters so long but it needs to be said.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nThis anime is extremely repetitive, all the episodes are more or less the same but with different food and maybe a new situation. The moments with the father and daughter can be somewhat heart touching, but that's not a hard thing to pull off in general. You can't have an anime with \"Cute\" and \"Heart touching\" being the only thing going for it without a good story. I found myself wanting each episode to be over halfway in them, especially in the later ones.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nWhile this anime may be bland, boring and repetitive, I still think it holds *some* value, even if it is something as small as a reminder that food is made with love.\\n\\n\r\nAgain don't get me wrong, I am not hating on this anime. If you like it and think it's cute, that's you. I just personally was hoping for some actual story development.\\n\\n\r\nI personally do not recommend this unless you are really curious and it interests you. It became a small chore to watch for me, and may for you too. I would not re-watch even if I re-watched every other anime I actually enjoyed twice.",

Characters are relatable and their expressions are very humane, therefore the show was quite immersive and it made you feel like how the characters actually felt. Every frame was just heartwarming and since this anime has a food theme going on I think the great art just added up to the overall tone. Now for the negative part, this show kind of ended with a cliffhanger with no conclusion, just like how most of the slice of life animes end up being like these days. Since there was no conclusion I felt so empty and wondered what isgoing to happen to the characters I got so attached to... I would recommend this to everyone looking for a laid-back and happy show to lighten their mood up!",

The main story follows around a father who is now raising his daughter after his wife dies. From this the story takes off. With this surrounding food, it is very hard not to get hungry from watching this, the story I give a 7. \r\nArt: As for art, the animators had to give the food a strong look. You  can't have an anime with food beingit main focus, and not give it a great look. The art I give a 9.\\n\\n\r\nSound: As for sound, their is only a sub out right now, and I do not think a dub is planned anytime soon. But as for the actors they did theirs job well. Tasumgi was cute like her acting should been handled.  The sound I give a 10. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As for characters I think in a slice of life anime, you really develop for characters. It light hearted so you feel for the characters at the end, I want a second season for this so much because I feel anime like this is too short. The characters I give an 8. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: The overall value is a 7, I feel like this is one of those anime you feel softly about in the end. As for enjoyment it is a 9 for me, when you have good food it always gets a really great feeling.",

            "content": "To put it shortly, this anime is definitely heartwarming, but not amazing. Should you watch it? Probably go through the first few episodes and see for yourself, because the way this anime will end up sitting in your mind depends largely on your personal opinion.\r\nTo start off, I enjoyed this anime not in its entirety, but mostly in the heartwarming and somewhat familiar situation it presented me in. I was at first apprehensive on whether or not to get on board with this anime, because objectively it was not something I found to be that great. However, not because of the premise, but the backstoryof the characters, I found myself empathizing and eventually endearing the characters. Soon enough, the quick glimpses of dark past each character had became something I could relate to, and soon enough I found myself enjoying this anime more than I should.\\n\\n\r\nWhy I say this anime depends largely on personal opinion is because of how I ended up interpreting it myself. As a person not from a family with a great background, it was easy to relate to the situation of the protagonists, and the main hook of the anime for me was how everyone was able to innocently and earnestly enjoy themselves despite all the family related adversity each character had to face, and somehow eventually forming familial like ties with one another. Indeed, this anime captured my heart, and the food looks good too... :p\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, you may not like this anime for what it will present you, but you will probably enjoy the first few episodes as they carry more emotional weight. Objectively, this anime is average, but in a good way. You do not need to finish this anime to grasp its beauty, so do not worry about that. Just enjoy it while you can.",

Trying to get over the sadness of losing his wife while trying to take care of his child. Sounds great doesn't it ?\r\nWell it did. But then it became a cooking show... Yeah f*ck all the quality drama and tragedy that could have been the main focus we should instead focus on a father that tries to cook for his daughter with his student helping him. Oh jolly !\r\nI wouldn't be this salty if the cooking was implemented nicely to the storywhile still retaining it's original slice of lifey feeling. But cooking is like a bored and horny old man that tries exhibitionism for the first time. It's just a sorry and revolting sight. If I wanted to watch a cooking show I would. But this anime is so poorly written except it's setting that it can't progress the story and cooking at the same time. So it just goes with cooking that repeats episode after episode. If you want a cooking anime go watch Shougeki no soma that still can progress the story instead of repeating episode after episode. I can't even watch this anime for their seiyuus like Rina Endou and her adorable voice (Hina from barakamon)",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nLike Tsumugi of Amaama to Inazuma, I used to never eat one specific vegetable: onions.\r\nI still don\u2019t eat them as is, but I do love to get them as fried onion rings. Whenever my family and I go out to eat, we always order the tall stack of them with an extra side of dipping sauce. The brown, flaky casing, the slimy onion innards, and the cool, sweet sauce that I lather this dichotomy with make it one of my favorite foods to consume.\r\nAmaama to Inazuma doesn\u2019t taste as gross as regular onions, but itdoesn\u2019t taste as wonderful as the fried version. Instead, it roughly ends up somewhere in-between.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nAmaama to Inazuma centers on the kind Kouhei Inuzuka and his darling daughter Tsumugi. The death of Kouhei\u2019s wife has left Tsumugi without a mother, and, when he realizes that Tsumugi no longer likes the boring food he has been giving her, he takes it upon himself to learn how to cook and provide her with meals that will make her happy. Together with Kotori, one of his students, the three have fun and food galore.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for this anime, it ends up in a category that no story wants to find itself in: wasted potential. For Amaama to Inazuma has all the makings of a strong show \u2013 thoughtful premise, fun characters, interesting ideas \u2013 but ultimately goes nowhere with them.\\n\\n\r\nTake its premise. Kouhei lost his wife; Tsumugi lost her mother. Despite having these elements in place, the anime does not go anywhere that deep. Tsumugi lacking a female guide. Kouhei dating other women. What their relationship looks like from an outsider\u2019s perspective.\\n\\n\r\nMost striking is how the anime approaches the death of Kouhei\u2019s late wife. That is to say, they barely touch on it at all. The few occasions when they do, it\u2019s either a quick flashback without much weight behind it or the anime does not go as far as it can.\\n\\n\r\nThis last point is especially true in the final episode. Kouhei and Tsumugi are clearly dressed (and saddened) as they leave to see Tsumugi\u2019s mother\u2019s grave, but the anime stops there. It does not give Kouhei\u2019s thoughts or show what Tsumugi did when she visited. Instead, the opening track plays, and the episode resumes, carrying on per usual.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, this mindset may be unfair since Amaama to Inazuma aims to be lighthearted over serious. Tsumugi\u2019s cute antics and Kouhei\u2019s doting actions do not leave room for these deeper topics. However, this decision to adhere to more shallow content leads into the anime\u2019s biggest problem and largest reason for wasted potential: repetition.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime refuses to deviate from its own recipe. The first half of an episode presents some conflict or slice-of-life happening involving Tsumugi, and the second half shows the group making food, resolving the previous issue simultaneously. These ingredients are purchased from the beginning and are never replaced with anything else throughout the entire season.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not as if the anime is a comedy that relies on the same brand of humor. Simply put, the content in this show almost never tries to spice anything up. Kouhei reacts in a worried manner when Tsumugi does or says something peculiar, which touches the heart, but he almost always does so in the same way. Tsumugi dances or sings to \u201chelp\u201d with the cooking, which is no doubt cute, but she almost always performs her \u201cmagic\u201d in a similar fashion.\\n\\n\r\nEven the choice of venue is problematic; they always go to Kotori\u2019s kitchen. Kouhei\u2019s apartment, visiting Yagi\u2019s place, or even just an outside barbeque area are places never considered. Combined with the repetitive structure and events, the anime has no chance of escaping its own restrictive direction.\\n\\n\r\nThe food itself can also get repetitive, but at least here they change what gets made each time. Yet it\u2019s not the repetition that that makes the food a problem but rather how it practically gets in the way.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it\u2019s nice that the show wants to show the audience a lot about food, very few people are watching this anime for the food. Food is arguably not even the point of the anime. Indeed, it\u2019s (supposed to be) about Kouhei, Tsumugi, and the relationship between them. So, while the explanation behind proper vegetable cutting or flour sifting is appreciated, it ultimately feels like the story wastes time on something much less important.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, to be as fair as possible, the food does serve a higher purpose. If it weren\u2019t for the soup or gyoza that they make, Kouhei and Tsumugi would not be able to connect as readily as they do. He learns to listen to her more carefully, and she comes to understand that he always has her and her best interests in mind, even when he\u2019s scolding her. In other words, food is the mediator that brings them closer together.\\n\\n\r\nMost importantly, food has an underlying parallel. A homecooked meal takes time, preparation, and a whole lot of thought to get right. It\u2019s the same way with relationships. They don\u2019t just miraculously form but rather require these same qualities. Tsumugi and Kouhei have a head start because they are already father and daughter. But, through her positive outlook and his nurturing hand, the two make meals that reflect the very relationship they share: warm, filling, and full of love.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, though, not delving deeper into its obvious topics, the nauseating format, and the misplaced focus make this parallel and the anime\u2019s other meaningful ideas \u2013 like the need for healthy relationships and what Tsumugi learns applies just as much to Kouhei (and the audience) \u2013 wasted potential that does not go realized.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nAmaama to Inazuma\u2019s art is an unseasoned dish: digestible but not flavorful.\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of seasoning comes from its inherent inability to branch out. Kouhei\u2019s apartment, the school, and Kotori\u2019s kitchen are the most prominent places visited, but they lack any interesting details to speak of. Admittedly, Tsumugi\u2019s nursery school does a better job of capturing that environment with pictures on the walls, the outside play area, and the little cubbies that hold the kids\u2019 materials.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, the anime focuses most of its attention on the food itself. At the minimum, the anime passes in this regard. While the food almost never jumps out at the audience as delectable, the steamed rice, the filleted fish, and the hamburg-steak are dishes that have care put into them.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime can have some small hiccups, like when a shot of Kotori from a medium distance looks weirdly wonky or some of the animation is slightly choppier than desired. However, animation usually keeps up when they are in the kitchen separating squid or mixing curry.\\n\\n\r\nWhat little flavor the show does contain comes solely from the designs of the characters. Especially Tsumugi. Her long, frazzled hair highlights her energetic personality. Wide eyes and a host of different outfits gives her the cute-kid look with ease. And her ginormous smile is infectious to the core.\\n\\n\r\nKouhei and Kotori have their appeal, too. Kouhei\u2019s polos, plain face, and square glasses scream fatherhood, and Kotori\u2019s constant blushing and purple hair pinned up in a ponytail when cooking (to keep it out of the way) give her a welcoming aura. The Band-Aid on her finger is a nice touch and immediate reference to her knife-centric conflict.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Amaama to Inazuma are more appetizing than its story and its art. Thanks mostly to a certain character (which anybody could guess on the first try): Tsumugi.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, anime has a difficult time crafting kid characters. Usually, they just lean on the easy-out, making them too darn cute and overly nice. As though an angel descended from heaven in child form.\\n\\n\r\nMost people know that kids are not saints. Yes, they can be endearing and kind like any normal person, but they lack a very important trait: maturity. Toddlers, kids, and teenagers simply don\u2019t have the life experience to socialize and approach everyday situations in a respectful, mature manner.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at Tsumugi, she is totally cute when she smiles her beaming smile after eating some good-tasting food, and she is more than nice when she cheers on her dad. But, best of all, she acts like a kid. She pouts uncontrollably when she gets into a fight with one of the boys at nursery school. She has a public temper tantrum after getting heavily scolded by Kouhei. She gets too rowdy one time, nearly ruining some of the food they were working on. She gets upset when she realizes that the okonomiyaki restaurant did not cook it in the style she thought they would.\\n\\n\r\nTsumugi\u2019s lack of maturity is not her only kid-defining trait; she has other characteristics that make her a believable child character. She loves Mr. GaliGali, a fluffy, pink animal from her favorite cartoon. She cannot stand vegetables, especially green peppers. She makes plans to invite everyone she knows to Kotori\u2019s house for the \u201cparty\u201d they will be having before receiving permission from Kotori and her mother. She has a tough time comprehending doughnuts because they are simultaneously a snack and a meal. She can only cut with a knife at most three times before getting exhausted.\\n\\n\r\nAmaama to Inazuma\u2019s efforts to make Tsumugi into a realistic kid clearly show. She crafts personable scenes through her understandable actions and range of emotions. She is a top-tier example of what a child character can (and should) be, and, as such, she is arguably the best part of the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nKeeping an eye on her as much as he can, Kouhei, Tsumugi\u2019s daddy, has his own direction. He\u2019s an everyday guy, working as a teacher and caring for his daughter by himself. Just as Tsumugi lost a mother, he lost his dearly beloved wife. He grasps the gravity of this situation more than Tsumugi, but, as the parent, it\u2019s his job to be there for her.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, as each episode depicts, he does just that. Nothing else enters his mind besides Tsumugi. What they do, where they go, and how they live always goes back to her, indicating his own strength as a parent. Because, for parents, their children are their everything, so it makes sense that he keeps her in mind with whatever dish they create next.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, he may be a bit too much on the soft side since he is quick to apologize to her when something unsavory goes down. However, he also has more sides to him than simply a passive father. He yells at Tsumugi when she went out by her lonesome. He teaches her how to get through to her friends. He cries tears of joy when he sees her finally enjoying food for the first time in a long time.\\n\\n\r\nHe\u2019s not as definitive of a father character as Tsumugi is a child character, but, like Tsumugi, his actions and emotions ground the anime in believability and therefore improve Amaama to Inazuma\u2019s overall execution.\\n\\n\r\nBest of all is the relationship that Tsumugi and Kouhei share. Some of the strongest moments in the entire season form from their interactions. Whether it\u2019s Tsumugi jumping onto her daddy\u2019s back to console him or him sitting down and speaking with his daughter in earnest, their relationship likewise stands as a testament to the show\u2019s believable direction.\\n\\n\r\nFor that\u2019s the whole point of the anime. It\u2019s not at all the food, no matter how much it may seem that way. Rather, it\u2019s their connection. A father and a daughter. The love they share, and the way in which they influence each other. In other words, they live lives filled with sweetness and as electrified as lightning because of the bond between them.\\n\\n\r\nThat leaves Kotori who has been purposefully left out of the discussion up to this point. And for fair reason because she is easily the worst of the three.\\n\\n\r\nHer aichmophobia (or a fear of sharp things) pushes her to let Kouhei and Tsumugi use her family\u2019s kitchen because she needed someone to handle the cutting and general knife-wielding. Kouhei obviously needed a more suitable cooking environment than his cramped apartment, so he had no qualms with her initial deception.\\n\\n\r\nKotori has a mother whose television exploits embarrass her, and she has a deep affection for food, savoring it as much as possible whenever she sits down for a meal. She\u2019s a kind person, aiding Kouhei in his quest to connect more with Tsumugi through the food they create.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for her, she receives very little attention throughout the season. In essence, she becomes nothing more than a third wheel, her presence neither adding to nor subtracting from Amaama to Inazuma\u2019s content.\\n\\n\r\nShe does have a small moment when her friend Shinobu appears and she gets jealous that this special hobby may no longer involve just the three of them. But, when she does not have any interesting moments with Kouhei or Tsumugi, and other parts of her character besides her love of food go unexplored, she fails to have an impact on the anime.\\n\\n\r\nWorst of all, though, is how her fear of knives does not get resolved. She gets an extremely minor flashback, lasting not even three seconds, that depicted how her fear set in as a child. And Tsumugi\u2019s own courage in using knives is noticed and addressed by Kotori. But the anime never has her face her fear, ultimately making her a third wheel that doesn\u2019t even turn.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nTo up Tsumugi\u2019s believability even more, Amaama to Inazuma enlists Rina Endou, a child voice actress, to take on the role, and she does well. While her crying segments were slightly underwhelming, she nailed Tsumugi\u2019s cute laugh, her happy comments, her pouting attitude, and her childlike wonder at the food before her.\\n\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack also does well. The tracks are often very light, using xylophones, chimes, flutes, piano, and shakers to create small, catchy pieces that softly guide the different scenes along. Their friendly tone and how they do not overtake the scenes also add to their appeal. And the semi-grandiose track that plays whenever the meal is officially ready to eat may not be the best of the bunch, but it certainly highlights the show\u2019s sense of fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track is rather recognizable with its back-and-forth, rising, and catchy lyrical play that makes up the beginning of the song and most of the second half, adding more of that lightheartedness and that fun the anime strives for. The background bells, the younger-sounding vocalist, and simplicity of the beat get at these qualities even more. It ends on a pretty abrupt note, but it\u2019s overall a nice piece.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track goes nowhere near as energetic as the OP. Instead, it opts for a more reserved piece that highlights the contented side of life and the happiness that Kouhei, Tsumugi, and the others all share. The prominent guitar adds a feeling of nostalgia, and the vocal work brings the right amount of passion into the project. Like the OP, it sounds as though it ends before it wants to, but, once again like the OP, the ED is still a nice piece to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not a ton of anime that focus on a father and his relationship with his child. But, each time I watch one, they only continue to instill in me my passion to have that connection myself someday.\\n\\n\r\nI think I\u2019d be a good dad. Playing games of peek-a-boo or tag. Teaching him or her right from wrong. Being there for their biggest moments. I\u2019d simply have to emulate my own father and the meticulous care he put into my own upbringing, and I\u2019m sure I would be more than ready for whatever such a step in my life would bring.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say things would be easy. The tantrums, the difficulty of getting through to one\u2019s child, and the worry of whether one is currently taking the correct action are all examples that I\u2019m aware of. Examples that Tsumugi and Kouhei demonstrate through their own relationship.\\n\\n\r\nBut the fun times would be there, too. Occasions like Kouhei excited over seeing Tsumugi in her first play or even simply her happiness and that toothy smile bringing him the utmost elation are ones that I myself hope to experience in due time.\\n\\n\r\nMoving from the personal to the material, I like the show a lot. Again, that\u2019s very much thanks to Tsumugi. Her silly lines and reactions and her general positivity are heartwarming. Peering around the corner when peppers come into play and a mischievous expression that crosses her face when near Yagi\u2019s house make her a fun, cute character. And, repetition aside, her dances and singing got me smiling and laughing with ease.\\n\\n\r\nKouhei could be fun, too. While I would have liked to have seen him have more of a personality than just regular guy, he had his moments. He got super happy when Tsumugi, with tongue out and a \u201cNwope!\u201d, turned down Mikio\u2019s \u201cmarriage proposal.\u201d And his concern for her picking up teenage jargon highlights his dad mentality to the core.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, the oddball out is Kotori. I don\u2019t mind her because she\u2019s nice and helpful. But she just exists without contributing much (if anything) to the dynamic that Tsumugi and Kouhei share. The same can be said for Shinobu and Yagi but to a much larger extent; they just weren\u2019t around enough or did enough to warrant any significant feelings from me towards them.\\n\\n\r\nOne final note that most likely needs addressing. I do not view Kotori\u2019s relationship with Kouhei as romance-driven whatsoever. It never comes off that way from either of them. To me, she seems more like an older sister to Tsumugi and a teenage daughter to Kouhei.\\n\\n\r\nWhich gets at my speculation that the anime will go that route with Kotori\u2019s mother.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime constantly alludes to this woman through Kotori. Plus, she is the one giving them the recipes to work with. She shows her face only once near the beginning and finally making an official appearance in the last episode (speaking the words about Kouhei\u2019s love for Tsumugi that everyone else was too shy to say).\\n\\n\r\nGiven that Kotori\u2019s father is never mentioned (as far as I\u2019m aware), the mother herself is a chef, and, again, how Kotori fits between Tsumugi and Kouhei, them all becoming a family makes both logical and narrative sense.\\n\\n\r\nAll speculation and source-reading confirmation, of course. But it\u2019s still fun to think about. Until I get a final answer (since the source for this anime is still ongoing), I\u2019ll be going with these thoughts as my head canon.\\n\\n\r\nAmaama to Inazuma wastes a lot of its potential in its story when it cannot approach its content differently. However, the show contains many worthwhile characteristics. The relationship Tsumugi and Kouhei share, some strong musical and voice-acting performances, and enough cute moments to fill a buffet. The art and the animation leave one wanting, but this anime is a fried onion ring worth taking a bite out of.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, a refusal to explore the more obvious topics on its plate and to deviate from its formulaic structure incite nausea, while the food motif both hinders and parallels\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, Tsumugi\u2019s design rocks, and the food doesn\u2019t look gross, but not much else comes off as visually appetizing\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Tsumugi is one of the better kid characters in the medium due to her realistic portrayal, Kouhei emerges as a respectable father, and the connection they share matters most, but Kotori succumbs heavily to third-wheel syndrome\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good OP, okay ED, good OST, and good VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, being a father seems way too awesome to pass up\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

            "content": "I can't say this anime did anything particularly wrong or misrepresented its source material, but it still feels like a textbook example of 'just OK'.\r\nSTORY\r\nThe plot follows several stories taken from the first few volumes of the manga. There are few changes beyond occasionally combining two storylines into one. A good job was done in picking a fitting last episode for this show so it still feels like there is a climax and wrap-up, even with the episodic story structure.\r\nANIMATION & SOUND\r\nThere may not have been any significant slip-ups, but this animation looks very basic for a 2016 show. Backgrounds look minimum standard at times,and while it's nice to see the characters from the manga move around, I think a bit of detail was lost. Sound is fine with solid voice acting. The happy sounding ED 'Maybe' by Brian The Sun has been running through my head these last few days.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is basically the same as it is in the original manga. Kohei is designed to be an everyman with the broadest possible appeal, but he manages to have just enough of a personality to avoid being entirely generic. Tsumugi's little kiddie songs get more attention- usually at points where the anime needs to pad out the length of an episode just a little. Kotori is still a gold-tier Best Girl.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nWhen I rate a show as a '5' it means one of two things: 1) Major pros and cons cancel each other out, 2) It's very middle-of-road without significant strengths or weaknesses. The Sweetness and Lightning anime is an example of case 2.",

            "content": "I keep my reviews short and to the point to give you a quick insight of this anime.\r\nStory 6/10 \r\nAmaama to Inazuma or Sweetness and Lightning is a slice of life comedy about Kouhei Inuzuka, a teacher, who takes care of his daughter alone after the death of his wife.  Being no good at cooking, Inuzuka seeks the help of Kotori, one of his pupils, to help feed his daughter Tsumugi.  They usually cook inside Kotori's family's restaurant, which is mostly empty.  The story takes place in modern time and is based in Japan.  The first few episodes of the serieswas quite refreshing and light-hearted, but it gets boring soon.  Each episode is based around the same premise, we get to watch the Inuzuka's everyday life, Tsumugi wants dinner, and then they go to Kotori's diner to eat.  There is little to no story development.  (But of course, you have to take into consideration this is a slice of life anime) The whole show's foundation is the cuteness of Tsumugi and the food that Kouhei, Tsumugi, and Kotori cook together.  A show with a very simplistic plot.  Nothing much else can be said, this is just your average slice of life anime.  It isn't anything special or extraordinary, but the show just screams \"CUTE!\"\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is exceptionally cheerful and fun, befitting of the show.  I can say it is even beautiful at times.  Just a really, really, bright show.  The animation captures the cuteness of characters, like Tsumugi.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song of Amaama to Inazuma is Harebare Fanfare by Mimi.  Again, the song matches well to the overall show. Light, cheery, fun.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters go through little to no character development.  Nothing much is explained about them, and no conflict changes them in any way.  Again, this is a slice of life anime, so I didn't really expect anything to happen.  The reason why this is at such a high score is because you can't deny the cuteness of the characters.  Tsumugi and the other children just make you melt at the sight of them.  It is something that is inexplicable unless you actually watch the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nTo repeat, I enjoyed the first few episodes of this anime, but it started getting very repetitive and eventually bored me out.  Other slice of life anime, in my opinion, were a lot more entertaining than this one.  Each episode just lacks variety. \\n\\n\r\nBonus \\n\\n\r\nGurls 7/10 *Whenever there are girls that capture my attention in an anime, I will scout them for you as waifu material ;)*   \\n\\n\r\nKotori really stood out as waifu material.  Clumsy, kind, and shy, she is a pure angel! Her mom is also pretty good, but I'm not into Milfs ;).  If you're waiting for me to review the little girls in this anime, you are sick pls kys.  \\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\r\nIF YOU ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO REPETITION AND BOREDOM, DON'T WATCH. IF YOU LIKE A CUTE FLUFFY ANIME, WATCH IT! \\n\\n\r\nOverall 6.8",

            "content": "First of all i haven't seen the manga that acts as the source material for this anime so as a result the first time i seen the characters and setting was in the anime itself. \r\nNow then lets get started \r\nSweetness and lightning that i also call Amama is a slice of life anime that focuses on the relationship between a father and a daughter. \r\nThe overall story revolves around the every day lives of the two as the father tries to raise him alone. Watching these two gradually bond over the series over the making of homemade meals is a joy to behold. \r\nKoheiis one of the main characters of the show and is Tsumugi's father. He tries his best to raise her while balancing work. As can be expected this is challenging and Kohei despite being a good father is not actually a good cook. However his attempts to provide meals for his daughter despite this is heartwarming. \\n\\n\r\nAfter encountering Kotori though and seeing how much his daughter loves homemade meals Kohei's character and  personality changes. Now he is willing to learn how to cook despite his inexperience. This change i welcome as homemade meals are always better than what you would find on the street. Kohei's transformation from a normal person that doesn't know how to cook to a somewhat able cook was a joy to see. \\n\\n\r\nTsumugi is Kohei's daughter and is a excitable, positive and somewhat ecstatic person.  Like all kids she can be excitable and can often get into arguments with kids of similar age at the kindergarten where she attends. However at her core Tsumugi has a nice personality and has infinite curiosity with everything including food. \\n\\n\r\nTusmugi's relationship with her Father Kohei is one of the centerpoints in the anime and i think it was shown and done pretty well as you can see just how much she loves him. Tsumugi's character was really adorable and this is no small part due to her seiyuu. \\n\\n\r\nKotori serves as the third main character of the series and is actually one of Kohei's students. Kotori actually serves as the second heroine of the series. Her family owns a restaurant in the nearby town. However her relationship with her mother while close is offset by the fact that her mother is always away on work and as such she is a bit of a loner. One aspect of her character that i like is that she doesn't hide the fact that she is honest about food. Her relationship with Kohei and how they all met though is quite funny. \\n\\n\r\nAs the daughter of a chef and a celebrity chef as well you would probably expect  her to be an impressive cook but due to trauma from her childhood this is not so. However by following her mothers recipes and with a little teamwork she is able to create many new, varied and no doubt tasty meals that she will also get the chance to enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nKotori's relationship with Kohei and Tsumugi though is interesting though as i think she sees them more as a family than she has been lacking and missing all these years. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall art and animation that was used in the anime was pretty well done.  And the character designs were also pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nOverall music was good and the opening and ending themes were really cute \\n\r\nand appropriate for the series. Scene music was also apt for the scene in question. \\n\\n\r\nOverall i actually liked this series because it was relaxing and a nice change of pace for other animes that were out at the time. The relationship between Tsumugi and Kohei was cute and seeing the bond develop between them was nice. Saori Hayami who portrays Kotori did a great job as always as did the support cast. \\n\\n\r\nOf the support cast the character of Shinobu who was played by veteran seiyuu Haruka Tomatsu was also one of my favorites due to her interactions with Yagi.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The characters and initial plot are interesting, original, cute, and even yummier, and the first few episodes are definitely worth a watch, but after that, it gets monotonous and boring. \r\nI personally couldn't bring myself to finish this series because I got so sick and bored of the roundabout plot and gave up on it knowing that I probably wouldn't miss much anyways. The anime ends up focusing too much on just food and ignores character and outside plot developmentwhich is really not what I look for in a good anime. I would blame the manga for dragging down this anime because the plot isn't much better there (caught up as of now) though. If you like the manga, the anime is exactly like the manga, so if you're that kind of person, definitely give this anime a go because it doesn't stray for the manga. \\n\r\nTL;DR: just watch the first few episodes and save your time, but if you want to learn how to make a few dishes anime style, give it a go, but don't count on it turning out too well.",

Though it takes the form of a typical episodic series with a different recipe every instalment, the series still touches upon more profound themes of fatherhood and grief as father and daughter have to adjust to life after the death of Tsumugi's mother. \r\nIn this way, it is atypical in its genre\u2013 though not fully developed, it explores the hole left in our lives after the death of a family member: how we struggle to fill their role in the life of our loved ones, and how cherished and profound their contributionsare in our lives (even if it is as simple as a home-cooked meal that we miss). When viewed in this light, the challenges that Tsumugi's father faces are more than simply learning how to cook. In a period of time in Japan where the responsibilities of raising children and domestic chores are still placed on women, it's refreshing to see an anime that celebrates the efforts of a single father.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall tone still remains light-hearted and filled with scenes of general cuteness from Tsumugi and the high-school girl that cooks alongside her and her father.  It's a feel-good and easily digestible anime if you ever need one.",
