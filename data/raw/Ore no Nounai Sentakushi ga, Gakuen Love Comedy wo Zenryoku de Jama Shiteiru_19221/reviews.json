The very important and necessary choice that will change all of our futures.\u201d\r\nChoose.\r\n1: Read the rest of the review.\r\n2: Do not read the rest of the review.\r\nWell, if you kept reading I\u2019m assuming you picked number 1 and decided to read my review about Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru aka My Mental Choices Are Completely Interfering With My School Romantic Comedy aka Noucome, I\u2019ll be referring to it as Noucome for bothyours and my sake. \\n\r\nThe review will be spoiler-free so some things that I point out may seem a bit oblivious but I don\u2019t really want to spoil anything for those who\u2019d like to watch this.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is about a boy named Kanade Amakusa who\u2019s a high school student however he suffers from a curse called \u201cAbsolute Choice\u201d. This curse does exactly what is sounds like, it forces our main character to choose from a series of options, these options will interfere with the way he and the things around him happen and interact, with many of the choices he\u2019s faced with being completely self-degrading and humiliating. Amakusa eventually comes across a choice wether he wants his neighbor or a beautiful girl to fall from the sky. He chose the second option and that\u2019s where he meets Chocolat, who eventually starts living with him.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can guess, this is essentially a comedy anime with a very simple yet effective plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main characters are with Kanade, the Rejected Five, it includes Yukihira Furano, a girl with a particular interesting sense of humor and who likes to abuse Kanade by calling him all sorts of things and Ouka Yuuouji, your typical happy-go-lucky and really cheerful girl.  They\u2019re pretty much the school \u201cweirdos\u201d and the people with which Kanade spends the most time.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters have some kind of special trait that distinguishes them from the others, are carefully animated and above all really really funny. Whether it\u2019s from an Absolute Choice, Furano\u2019s sense of humor, Yuuouji\u2019s lack of shame or even Chocolat\u2019s lack of common sense you\u2019re bound to crack a smile or, tons of laughs as the humor is really well executed and not really repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nYou eventually discover one or two little twists about these characters and get introduced to even more characters as Kanade is forced to do missions to get rid of his curse, these missions mainly include an interaction of some sort with the cast. If Kanade fails one these missions, he\u2019ll be stuck with the \u201cAbsolute Choice\u201d forever, it\u2019s also in these missions and interactions that most of the character development comes from. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in Noucome is not extraordinary but it doesn\u2019t put the anime behind either, it matches with the light-hearted and colorful style of the anime. I didn\u2019t notice any kind of lazy animation or lack of detail in any scene. The background scenes also look pretty nice.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is appropriate but not really that amazing, the OP and ED songs are generic and the BGMs are also pretty standard, not really anything that makes me go up or down. It simply is appropriate for the kind of Romantic/Comedy anime we\u2019re talking about.\\n\\n\r\nI can say that I really enjoyed Noucome, it didn\u2019t really felt rushed and was overall a really pleasant experience that made me laugh way more than one time per episode. All the characters were unique and funny, the art was really good and the plot was the perfect setup for a Romcom like this.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like Romcoms then I definitely recommend you to watch Noucome, I promise you won\u2019t regret it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, as I bid a farewell to all of you;\\n\\n\r\nChoose.\\n\\n\r\n1: Rate this review as helpful.\\n\r\n2: Rate this review as not helpful.\\n\r\n3: Don\u2019t do anything.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading. \\n",

A lot of people would love to disagree with that statement, but let me explain. You need to have refined tastes in order to fully enjoy Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru. If you're a heretic who cries at every instance possible to complain about boobies and panties, well... this anime will be making you cry. On theother hand, if you watch anime with a laid-back attitude and you soak in all of the nuances that it has to offer, you will definitely like Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru.\\n\\n\r\nThe crux of Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru's plot is its comedy (well gee, it's not like the title gave it away or anything). The story revolves around Kanade Amakusa, a boy who carries a curse. His curse is that, at random moments, a God-like entity will come into his mind and force him to say embarrassing things or commit heinous acts. Thus, his \"mental choices completely interfere with his school romantic comedy\". Not to worry though, as although Kanade acts like a nut in every other scene, the truckload of girls that surround him are just as ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nEvery single female character in Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru is fantastic. How do you say \"extremely varied cast\" in Italian? Because that's exactly what was present in this anime. No two girls are similar, no girl is generic, and all of the girls are cute. God it just makes you want to hug them all. Chocolat, Furano, Reikadou \"Silicon\" Ayame, the Super Imouto, the Seito Kaichou... there are too many great girls to list in this anime. I tried to limit only one female character from Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru to put in my Favorite Characters list, and let me tell you; that wasn't easy. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, a quick interlude---let me give you a sample of what this anime's all about: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifKK8fjk3tI\\n\\n\r\nOre no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru is extremely ridiculous, as can be seen in that video (that video also happens to be my FAVORITE scene in the entire anime). However, that is also why it does so well. The comedy is so on point, so clever, and most important of all, so NATURAL. Never does Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru try too hard to be funny. You can tell the producers had a great time with this one (think back to the Erabe-god's laugh; god that was amazing).\\n\\n\r\nTechnically Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru follows Kanade Amakusu's quest to get rid of his \"Mental Choices\" curse; however, let's be real. The \"story\" is a pile of crap. Instead, the producers use that as quality comedy-fodder. From his mental choices, hilarious situations ensue. Just from reading the synopsis I could already tell Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru was going to have a stupid plot. Fear not, as Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru doesn't mind that it doesn't have a plot, we as the viewers shouldn't either. Just sit back, relax, and soak in the comedy of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nYou want to know how an anime qualifies as \"perfect\"? When it makes you laugh your ass off every episode; that's how. Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru single-handedly made my Wednesdays something to look forward to, and it was the only Fall 2013 anime to do so (I would usually put off the other simulcasts until I had more time to watch them, but not with this anime). And now, you too have a choice to make... to watch Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru, or not to watch Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru?\\n\\n\r\np.s. If you picked the second option... well, the Erabe-god will be laughing at you too.",

            "content": "Note: This review may appear quite long, but its structure doesn't force you to read everything, so please give it a fair try (;\r\n-1-\r\nImagine a life where nothing happens...\r\nImagine unspectacular schooldays, getting up early, disputing with your little sister at the breakfast table, chatting with friends about trivial issues, learning stuff you won't need to consider ever again in the future, going shopping on the way home, and finally fall into bed utterly exhausted as if the world has changed, but in reality you just repeat the same cycle over and over...\r\nEscaping this kind of monotonous life is not as hard as you might believe,but one ability is indispensable in doing so: the ability to make choices. First off, everyone can swim along with the mainstream, not choosing anything on their own, and therefore repeating their everyday life. You have to realize all the possibilities to make choices which directly affect your future, most of them not even noticeable and done basically automatically. To stress the importance of choices even more, you will begin to recognize their relevance just by reading this review. Have you heard of \"game books\" before? Providing a formidable way to directly influence the course of the story, you will find this review having the same option to choose your own course.\\n\\n\r\nWhy do I start with this explanation about choice-making, and how does it influence the actual anime we are talking about? In order to start,\\n\r\nread on at -5-. If you aren't fond of making even the first choice here, and you also have the guts to defy this anime's god, the master of choices, proceed at -10-.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-2-\\n\r\nTypical for newer anime, the art consists of detailed and distinguishable character parts and overall colourful backgrounds. The animation is rather ordinary, but that's fairly normal for the genre at hand, so there's no problem to get accustomed as viewer. All in all the characters keep their moe-looking appearances and please our eyes in many ways.\\n\r\nTo change into the Sound part, head for -4-, otherwise continue at -6-.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-3-\\n\r\nAs is often the case with RomComs, we have an above-average popular guy trying to keep his life in order while also having to deal with the distinctive cast of females around him. In this anime the guy's name is Kanade Amasuka; a boy who would actually possess a rather boring and average personality if it wasn't for the curse of \"Absolute choice\": a list of possible choices appearing right in front of his inner eye at the most inconvenient times. If you are familiar with visual novels, you will recognize this idea's origin at once. And guess what, these choices practically always force Kanade to perform highly embarrassing acts in front of his classmates. So why doesn't he just ignore this choice-making? Well, there's this peculiar being called \"God\" causing him immense pain upon not deciding. The same God also provides the only way for Kanade to cure his curse, namely by completing missions. Does he choose to fulfil them all, regardless of what consequences it may have for his future social life? To stress the romance part of the anime and in order to get Kanade more sensible on this matter, these missions consist of dealing with various girls in not too normal ways. \\n\r\nIf you want to know more about the female cast, venture forward to -7-, for just a small summary go to -12-.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-4-\\n\r\nThe sound as well as the music are neither memorable nor anything special, rather simply the usual light-hearted tone suited for any school comedy. OP and ED are standard as well... but at least the handstand performance sticks out. The seiyuus are performing their assigned roles without apparent fault, and although they sometimes miss the final spark of emotion, I enjoyed listening to their diversified voices a lot.\\n\r\nThat's it for sound, so either change into the Animation part (-2-), or continue at -6-.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-5-\\n\r\nAh, welcome. You've just done the first step in order to get to know this particular anime.\\n\r\nDon't be confused by its exceedingly long name, \"Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru\" (engl. \"My Mental Choices Are Completely Interfering With My School Romantic Comedy\"), usually shortened to NouCome. Adapted from a light novel of the same name, the title is summarizing the plot quite well actually. Therefore, you can expect a solid RomCom with a main character suffering over having to deal with all kind of choices he has to make. \\n\r\nIf you aren't fond of RomComs or students doing embarrassing and crazy stuff, you can either try to sit through and change your mind about this genre, or you cut a long story short and skip right to the conclusion at -15-. Otherwise you get acquainted with the main character at -3-.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-6-\\n\r\nThe enjoyment watching this anime won't reach any limit, if and only if you can cope with the general idea of visual novels, RomComs and don't mind fan service in a measurable, but not immoderate way. Coming this far through the review, you are most likely getting along with this idea and will eventually enjoy NouCome to the same great extent I did.\\n\r\nSee, to mark the occasion, god just decided to eliminate the second choice, so there's only one way to go on... that would be -15-.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-7-\\n\r\nAs with every good RomCom, you need to have a multifaceted bunch of girls providing a diversified view of the romance aspect. This cast consists of three main heroines and roughly the same amount of side characters. Within Kanade's class, we have the white-haired Yukihira Furano, a shy and more silent type who doesn't miss a chance to call him by insulting names. She has a strange kind of humour, and doesn't show it nearly as openly as Ouka Yuuouji, the class' cheerful airhead who is constantly participating in every joke and acting quite frankly around Kanade. \"There's no point in doing something boring.\"... a statement that would describe her life fairly well.\\n\r\nKanade, Yukihira and Ouka are also part of the so called \"Reject 5\", a group of the school's oddballs due to their overly antisocial behaviour. Since Kanade is forced to be in this group by the deeds of his curse, you can assume that he wants to escape his fate and therefore has a reason to complete his missions. The curse also provides him with human help in form of a beautiful sweets-loving girl suddenly falling from the sky upon him choosing it. She names herself Chocolat and causes Kanade to change even his life at home in many ways. Since she lacks some common sense, his life doesn't get that much easier even with the help of her knowledge regarding the curse.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, these main characters deliver a lot of fun throughout the whole anime, and the curse provides the needed freshness to get hooked immediately. If you feel that you haven't read enough character outline yet, go on to -11-, otherwise you may also proceed with Animation (-2-) or Sound (-4-).\\n\\n\\n\r\n-8-\\n\r\nYou defied god, your fate's 'bout to change\\n\r\nAnd no one dares to enter your range\\n\r\nThere is pain up ahead\\n\r\nAnd no mercy instead\\n\r\nYour surrounding's slowly getting strange\\n\\n\r\nWith your senses going on decline\\n\r\nBarely managing to see a shine\\n\r\nOf a more blurry life\\n\r\nNearly devoid of strife\\n\r\nOnly one way remains, go to -9-\\n\\n\\n\r\n-9-\\n\r\nDecisions can save a lot of time\\n\r\nBut only ones not including crime\\n\r\nYou have to seize the chance\\n\r\nWhich promotes the advance\\n\r\nLike I did when deciding this rhyme\\n\\n\r\nThe whole world of anime just right\\n\r\nWithin your comedy-yearning sight\\n\r\nWith NouCome on top\\n\r\nNot your average flop\\n\r\nSo now head to -14-, keep the fight\\n\\n\\n\r\n-10-\\n\r\nSo, you regard yourself special enough to defy god and the world's rules? I will give you one last chance to correct the taken path by turning round, now aiming for -13-.\\n\r\nOtherwise fasten your seat belts and continue at -8-.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-11-\\n\r\nMore about the characters, eh? If you read these lines, then there's no denying you are already quite interested in this anime. A picture is worth a thousand words, and there's nothing inhibiting you to start watching it right after you finished reading this review. Female side characters include a little sister type, an abnormal teacher and the student council, and everyone gets enough time to come into their own. Experience them for yourself.\\n\r\nStory and characters define an anime, but without the framework of Animation (-2-) and Sound (-4-) they couldn't support themselves properly. So choose...\\n\\n\\n\r\n-12-\\n\r\nEh... so you really thought that short summaries are sufficient enough to describe women? Don't get any false impressions of life.\\n\r\nIf you are now ready for the \"normal\" female review, turn to -7-, otherwise you may continue with Animation (-2-) or Sound (-4-).\\n\\n\\n\r\n-13-\\n\r\nThere's no fault in trying to swim against the current. Sadly though, nearly every world in confined by rules, and therefore you mustn't quail if a choice doesn't bear fruit. Other choices are awaiting you in your life as well as in this review, so turn your attention to -5-.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-14-\\n\r\nBut regardless, there's one thing to mention\\n\r\nSome time ago, you turned your attention\\n\r\nTo anime and more\\n\r\nAnd that's the perfect door\\n\r\nTo be able to grasp the dimension\\n\\n\r\nAnd so I hope for you to forge ahead\\n\r\nTo escape this loop, conquer your dread\\n\r\nchoose anime once more\\n\r\ndon't care about the score\\n\r\nyou've got time, head to -9-, relieve your head\\n\\n\r\n(Only read the following lines if you have completely understood the poem's intention, otherwise head to -9- as described!)\\n\\n\r\nThe first version of this review wouldn't have contained any escape routes out of this loop. But after getting the possibility to contemplate your actions, there isn't any easily understood reason for you to not deserve a new chance to use your power of choice.\\n\r\nYou may start into the actual NouCome-review now by going to -5-.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-15-\\n\r\nSo, how does it feel? Ready for a romance apart from the norm concerning its premise, exhilarant characters providing nice jokes while the poor guy gets embarrassed and the constant recall about the consequences of choices? I have to admit: recently there are lots of anime about romance stories in a school environment... but the simple difference which distinguishes NouCome from the rest is the actual concept of these hilarious choices Kanade has to make, reminding ourselves of the importance always accompanying choice-making.\\n\r\nAnd hey, this anime just has ten episodes! At least trying it won't cause any problems.\\n\r\nThe final choice is awaiting you, probably being the most important one in this review... read on at -16-.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-16-\\n\r\nAlthough you are bathing in this review's aftermath now, there's a high possibility that you will encounter at least one choice directly impacting the environment around you at least for the rest of the day. Maybe you choose to watch this very anime, \"Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru\", and suddenly your little sister bursts into the room, discovering your secret anime crush and in the end becoming your discussion partner for the newest shows. Life is a series of choices. But one thing's for sure: you won't advance if you don't choose...\\n\\n\r\nSo here's your final choice:\\n\r\n\u2022 Rate this review 'Helpful'\\n\r\n\u2022 Rate this review 'Not Helpful' (feedback is greatly appreciated)\\n\r\n\u2022 Just bid farewell",

            "content": "How we are able to comprehend something that is inherently dumb and insipid in shows such as these are let loose into the anime medium has always made me wonder what drives us into having such a thing as guilty pleasures. Now, when you imagine a show with those two terms in my mind, could you ever imagine a show like that trying to put in deep themes of free-will and choice into consideration? The answer to that question would be yes... and no.\r\nYes because something like Ore no Nounai, and no I refuse to spell out the absurdly long title, could've been thought outby writers just like in any kind of imaginative process of writing out ideas for shows. On the other hand, no because it would be impossible for an absurd RomCom like this to try to implement these kinds of themes perfectly, or at least it would take the skill of a talented writer to actually pull that off. Which, sadly, isn't the case for Ore no Nounai; but that's not to say it doesn't have its charming moments in some areas.\\n\\n\r\nThe major emphasis that the show really wants to drive its plot towards is the notion of how our lives are often being created by ourselves through the choices we make in them. Since this is a RomCom, our bland perverted protagonist is confronted with many choices that threaten his social status from girls around him, hence the title. Already the logic that is thrown at us is beyond erratic and not given much thought into how the \"Absolute Choice\" works exactly. For comedy's sake, there is an unfortunate lack of wit to the humor that these choices give to the audience in the sense that: Why are there mostly only two choices? For the record, most of the choices that are shown to Kanade aren't very imaginative or creative to say the least. When you have this opportunity to think of what you want the humor to go through, you need to bring out the big guns or else it'll just become tedious after a while.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the comedy does work is through some of the character interactions that do not involve the choice system. The chemistry between the girls and Kanade isn't the greatest because of how the girls don't leave much of an impression. There are definitely exceptions to this, them being Yukihira and Chocolat. Yukihira does come across as a vapid dandere character until she finally comes out of her shell and we get to really see what she actually is and thanks to the surprisingly well-done performance of new-comer Yui Kondou, who gives Yukihira a really funny mood swing-type of vibe to her archetype that works quite smoothly. Chocolat gives a larger-than-life personality to Ore no Nounai, despite her cliched nature when she is first introduced. While not as unique as Yukihira, her presence provides some nice needed wholehearted fun to the comedy and story.\\n\\n\r\nRomCom protagonists that are generally considered entertaining, or more specifically not annoying, are a rarity and Kanade is no exception to this fact. Not everything that he does or says are immediate eye-rolls, there are a few notable moments where he is quite humorous, but he eventually does go full force into bland, stereotypical protagonist territory where he acts extremely against the odds of what a normal teenager in the real world would react. This kind of thing would be done good in a comedic sense if the jokes weren't stuff that we have already seen on countless shows like Ore no Nounai and doesn't do anything with them than just copy and paste them into the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nInevitably, the artwork tries its best to make the girls look the cutest and sexiest that they can be.  They definitely succeeded in this domain in giving a lot of emphasis in coloring the characters that make them very easy to identify and help us remember a particular part of their design. The amount of blushing skin was a pretty nice touch in escalating the sexual tension from looking at the girls and their cute blushing faces. The sporadic animation helps in giving the humor some great traditional face reactions that we are used to in anime. However, there were moments where CG was used in some cars in a few scenes that looked pretty dreadful but thankfully there's not much to be remembered in infamy for.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the music can be construed as underwhelming in the actual show itself with your typical synthesizers, but the opening delivers a great song in showcasing the tone of the show as a whole. Even though the actual opening is quite lazy in how it was choreographed, the song at least fits well to the things going on in the opening. However, I found myself a bit perplexed in how the ending song was put into production for Ore no Nounai. It didn't fit very well to the tone in that it felt like it was more fitted into an action show than a romantic comedy.\\n\\n\r\nSurely, Ore no Nounai will be looked at as a strange attempt in trying to milk the high school comedy genre into grinding into slightly new territory. The result wasn't as fulfilling as the initial premise was shown before being released, but that shouldn't suggest that the show is of terrible quality. There isn't anything inherently offensive or needlessly degrading to anyone's intelligence, or at least the people who try to think too hard about it. It is convoluted as all hell in its subject matter and doesn't even bother to push it any further than what it generally tries to be another ecchi comedy. The fact that I'm even talking about how we look at ecchi comedies in anime in a different spectrum is at least a hopeful note in the future.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: C\\n",

            "content": "Have you ever wondered about how your daily life would be if your choices were to be dominated by some supreme random choice-generating entity? I haven\u2019t thought about it all that much myself, but apparently somebody else did, and, upon obtaining enlightment, wrote a novel based this profound reflection, and thought that publishing it would be a good idea\u2026\r\nKasukabe Takeru is the man, and Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru (NouCome for short) is the result of his introspection.\r\nThere is not much to say about the designs and animation, as they range from mediocre to subpar for theyear 2013 and never excel compared to countless other series. There is slight censorship in the TV anime version so you might want to check out the BDs for more exposed nipples and pantsu, but the fanservice is hardly ever that explicit anyway. \\n\\n\r\nOstensively, NouCome is a comedy. As such, it presents itself by employing quirky characters, some light ecchi and build-up scenes that lead to absurd conclusions. There is a story as well: MC has to clear ridiculous \u201cmissions\u201d so that he won\u2019t be the target of the random choice thing again, but you will realize it is all irrelevant very early in the series anyway. There is no real beginning to the random choice thing, as neither the time and circumstances in which it started, nor are the reasons are ever explained/specified, and there is no real conclusion either, as it simply never happens, and the random choices continue after the series ends. Maybe the OVA will fix this, but I have my doubts, and it\u2019s not like a real conclusion would bump up my opinion of the series that much, to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy itself is mostly a miss as well. For something with such a ridiculous premise, the jokes are pretty bland and uncreative, and get repetitive after a while. The whole series could be summarized in one sentence:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cERABE\\n\\n\r\nBoobs or do something dumb.\u201d *\\n\\n\r\nAnd really, that\u2019s all NouCome is about. The premise is just a pretext for mindless fanservice, the comedy is an excuse for either more mindless fanservice, or bad and unfunny jokes, the characters are all generic and unimportant: an excuse for even more mindless fanservice. The concept becomes a gimmick after a while since the conclusion is very predictable (afterall, you know he\u2019s going to clear the missions without fail in the end), and for that reason the series is not able to build any tension around jokes. The build-ups are very long (usually lasting one entire episode) and very diluted with random \u201cmoe\u201d and mindless fanservice, the jokes are really random without being weird, quirky or well thought-out and always end on the dumbest note\u2026 there is just so much that is wrong with this series that what actually HAPPENS in the series cannot be described with just a few paragraphs.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the characters are concerned, they all exist for comedic relief, mindless fanservice and are unimportant to the course of events. The main character doesn\u2019t contribute to the story in any way, he is just a victim of it and, in the end, a tool with no personality existing only for self-insert. The rest of the cast is all female, and is composed of tropes that couldn\u2019t be any more generic, bland, and poorly portrayed. Furano is the (tsundere + emotionless) /2 girl with personality disorder (not actual illness, of course, just sudden changes in personality to maximize the \u201cmoe\u201d effect...) , Ouka is the genki childhood friend that secretly has feelings for MC, Yuragi is the loli that wants to be everyone\u2019s imouto (yeah let\u2019s not talk about it), Seira is the student council president, Ayame is the rich ojou-sama (am I the only one who finds her \u201csecret\u201d slightly disturbing, considering she\u2019s in high school?), but the biggest offender of this sack of crap is the main girl Chocolat, which pretty much acts like a puppy animal whenever she is provided with kibble (sweets in her case). There is one episode (the 7th) in which she regains the memories of her past after hitting her head and starts acting \u201cnormally\u201d and explaining unimportant shit to MC to help him with his problem. I guess you could call this \u201ccharacter development\u201d, albeit contrived and poorly placed, if only she didn\u2019t hit her head at the end of the episode, lose all her memories one more time, and ultimately go back to her dog-like personality. \\n\r\nI guess that if there was one character I enjoyed, it would be Yawakaze Konagi\u2026 she\u2019s still useless and her jokes unoriginal but at least her design is pretty cute and her moments are among the \u201cbest\u201d in the series.\\n\\n\r\nNouCome is among the worst Japanimation has ever produced. There is really no content here\u2026 just ten episodes of void over average computer art 2D designs. It\u2019s not the first time anime has produced something like this, and it\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly why this is more insulting, more cancerous, and more impossibly worthless than countless other series that have been made in this vein, but it is. Avoid at all costs.\\n\\n\r\n* (this quote is courtesy of a wise friend of mine.)",

            "content": "\"Noukome is just another generic harem-comedy.\"\r\n...Is probably the response you would get when asking about this anime. And it holds true, as Noukome proceeds with the same method as many of its preceding anime: MM!, To-LOVE-Ru, Date a Live. Once you've seen one, you've seen them all. Noukome obviously has its mind set for exchanging quality plot for cute girls and second-rate entertainment. However, Noukome obviously has a directed audience to those who like watching things like this. Which is why there's no reason for anyone to completely analyze and justify an anime such as this. It isn't an anime targeted for complex thinking, mysterysolving or touching moments. This path of thinking has led many to automatically assume that Noukome is bad without even giving it a chance. The harem genre obviously has had this type of treatment time and time again. Why do you think there's no high rated harem? \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows with Kanade Amakusa, who has been popular until he's recently gotten a problem with \"Absolute choice,\" where Amakusa must choose between two or more choices, usually commanding obscene actions that no one would do in public. However, if Amakusa does not choose to proceed with any of the choices, he receives pain punishment until he does so. Supposedly, this is the work of God himself (or herself, as this anime seems to play around). The concept and story of Noukome is a play on the popular visual novels seen in Japan, and Noukome attempts to make a comedy out of this, just as it is portrayed in the title.\\n\\n\r\nNoukome does a good job with the humor aspect -- I've laughed so many times that I've considered this anime a guilty pleasure. Yes, the plot has an uncountable amount of holes, and the characters are complete nuts. You would never see any of this in real life -- which is what makes it so entertaining. Do you want a story where a high school boy makes the choice whether or not to study for his History exam? Something like that wouldn't even get past the storyboard outline. And Noukome obviously has thrown away all its sense of the real world in order to make an outrageous scenario that makes us all smile at home. \\n\\n\r\nSo why the addition of the harem?\\n\\n\r\nThe harem definitely shifts the tide of audience more to teenage guys and men, and it makes the comedy much easier to direct to. This further reasons why second-rate plot is more common, because it develops the same amount of success with haphazard ideas. Obviously, not all are to be happy, as no anime is perfect. If a teenage guy were just to seek out outrageous entertainment, Noukome is probably a good go-to. It's funny, and fits the bill for most. Noukome does a good job on what its set out to do, but that doesn't mean it's entirely good.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it's fine to have ridiculous characters and plot, it doesn't really sink. Noukome is good, but also very forgettable. What Noukome does could potentially be strong if everything was developed much better. With only 10 episodes, Noukome has very little time to set an impact on the viewer, and the sheer amount of characters and plot points is destined for development failure. Thus, we are left with another forgettable anime in which we may see time and time again every season. Noukome in particular has pretty good execution though. Thankfully, it doesn't take itself too seriously, and continues to make fun of itself the whole way through.\\n\\n\r\nLooking more into the overall quality, the anime's art is as cute as it gets. And for good reason, as many will find themselves indulged in jealousy of the main character. The girls being as cute as they are, are in quite a variety and with their own ridiculous personality. It's honestly hard not to like most of the girls. The music and voice acting is equally respectable, as they both fit their designated roles pretty well. They are not supreme, but are good enough to be attractive. \\n\\n\r\nNoukome definitely serves justice for guys who seek a comedy, but not in the way that will have him talking about it for the years to come. Noukome is more of a show we enjoy and forget about, and gives us the laugh we may be looking for.",

            "content": "Ore no nounai sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru, or simply, Noucome.  If you were able to say that whole damn first title in one breath, congrats.  Life is a series of choices.  In it, there are good choices that lead down good paths, and bad choices which lead to not so desirable paths.  With that in mind, onto the review. \r\n (That is, if you choose to read the rest.  That's on you.  I'm just writing this for the fun of it.)\r\nStory (8/10): The anime itself is just as ridiculous as its title.The story follows a boy named Kanade Amakusa, who suffers from Absolute choice, meaning that his life is basically a gigantic visual novel where the choices that he makes leads him to strange and awkward routes.  Until one day, where a blond girl falls from the sky from one of his choices, leading him to begin his journey of ridiculous quests to get rid of his choice syndrome.  With all the visual novel nonsense and random girls falling from the sky, this story is really...absurd.  Seriously.  It has pretty good pacing, and is able to \"conduct\" its messed-up storyline well in terms of speed and transitions.  Speaking of its storyline, this is without a doubt very random.  Next to FLCL, it can be considered to have one of the most random storylines out there.  Oddly enough though, this anime works very well with its randomness, being able to funnel all of that into something that is in fact, a great comedy series.  Speaking of comedy, it's all random.  I'm not kidding, all of the comedy is pretty much random moments that everyone enjoys.  Especially since the comedy is all pretty original.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10): When you look at the characters, you'll see basically any anime archtype or character class you have seen in the past.  Meaning, you'll see things like the rich girl, the over-hyper one, the little sister that says (onii-chan), the glutton, all that sort of crap.  However, there is a reason why the characters are in such a high rating, and it's because of just how funny they really are.  While yes, they are all literally copies of existing character troupes, the characters take their character type, and skyrocket their potential.  Meaning, they all go overboard with their personalities.  Ex.  Little sister character wants to be EVERYONE's little sister.  It's this kind of thing that makes this anime so great.  They basically ridicule the anime troupes through their characters in a way that makes it just so frikin' fantastic and hilarious to watch.  Although I'm a little disappointed with the lack of main male characters aside from Kanade who is denser then a friking block of lead, it was still funny to see all of the female characters in their archtype glory. The side characters (and I mean side, not supporting.  Supporting is part of what is above.) are just completely pointless, but still funny.  They add their own stamp onto the anime, with the added conclusion of throwing them all in your face by the very end.  \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (9/10): The art in this anime was done by Studio Jack, which in turn, created a wonderfully colorful and bright look for this piece of absurdity.  The characters are all VERY detailed and very colorful.  It was to the point that they tried to showcase JUST how good the art was by doing screen scrollers of just the characters eyes to show off the detail.  The sound in this anime was just as good, in my opinion.  The OP has got to be, one of the most hyper and energetic sounding openings ever.  It's just so happy sounding and absurd, that it fits in so well with the anime!  The ED was also very good in my opinion, as it featured a hyper and energetic tune that was leaning towards the electric guitar compared to the OP leaning towards the drums, due to the crap ton of guitar riffs.  (By the way, regardless, you will hear both of these tunes one way or another.  The creators sneak them in.)  Personally, I love the soundtrack with all of its glory.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (10/10): It really shouldn't be a surprise with all the praise that I've been giving this show, that I would give this a 10/10, and also why it's one of my favorite animes of all time.  It's just so frikin' fun to watch.  Bear in mind, this isn't a masterpiece in any way, nor will it ever be, but it's just one of those series' that you can just sit down and enjoy without really thinking.  (seriously, don't think when you're watching this.)  The anime is completely absurd in every sense of the word, and that's what makes it so great.  The characters are a breath of fresh air with their own twists to the story, as well as the \"dramatic scenes\" between characters that deepens the story ever so slightly.  With 2-3 potential episode names/episode, as well as little \"opposite choices\" at the end of almost every episode (I'm just telling you this so you don't miss it, should you choose to watch it), the anime is nearly unpredictable and takes drastic turns at every possible moment.  With the added mechanic of absolute choice giving random and hilarious suggestions most of the time, the anime can literally turn into any situation period.  In the end, Noucome (I'm not writing that long-ass title again), is a wonderfully hilarious series that can make someone forget their troubles, and is just fun to watch if your looking for mindless entertainment.  There's also fanservice btw, so be careful.  (Pg-13 rating is bullcrap for this anime.)\\n\\n\r\nSo, faithful reader.  If you made it to the end, I will give you a few choices.  (Choose one or more)\\n\\n\r\n1.  Vote this review helpful\\n\r\n2.  Vote this review unhelpful\\n\r\n3.  Give me a comment on how you liked the review.\\n\r\n4.  Give me a critique on how I can improve my reviews.\\n\r\n5.  Ignore all of the above and go about your normal lives.\\n\\n\r\nGood day to you all.",

            "content": "\"Life is a series of choices.\" Some choices are life changing and some seem to hold little to no relevancy in the grand scheme of things. NouCome is a series that's dedicated to taking the concept of choice and transforming it into a fairly successful comedy. \r\nThe story of NouCome revolves around Kanade, a seemingly normal high school boy living a normal life. At least until a girl falls from the sky and he becomes afflicted with the curse of 'absolute choice'. Essentially this means that he is given random choices (often perverse or degrading to himself) and he must pick one of the choicesotherwise or else he is met with a stinging pain. The story is fairly entertaining, as the audience gets to see Kanade struggle to rid himself of his new found curse through 'missions' that involve amusing scenarios, but also lacks any substantial remembrance. I could watch an episode and easily forget what happened in it after a couple hours. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation of NouCome is pretty good. If you like ogling at boobs and panty shots, you'll probably enjoy the show visually. There is a fair amount of work that is put into making things colorful and vibrant and overall the show looks pleasing. In regards to the sound criteria, NouCome is pretty average. The OP and ED were okay, but I can't think of anything that particular stood out. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of NouCome are a silly bunch, but at least they're fun to watch. Unfortunately the character designs are extremely bland and mostly adheres to the common girls with big, bouncy breasts cliche in the comedy, school genres of anime. The characters are all pretty dense for the most part and it's not like the series really puts out great expectations for characters to begin with. What NouCome does successfully is making awkward situations between characters, often utilizing the absolute choice for comedic effect. As a whole, the characters provide a decent cast for a series of the comedy genre and at least they're all pretty likeable. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy part of NouCome succeeds at providing laughs, but they are quick and don't leave a lasting impression. Most of the jokes are hit or miss like all comedy, but NouCome had more hits than misses in my opinion. The concept of fan service is no stranger to this show and it bounces (literally) in and out consistently. If you're looking for some quick comedy with constant cleavage and panty angles, NouCome delivers it. It's a bit of a shame that this show was so immensely unpopular and sold horribly in Japan because NouCome was actually a decent comedy.",

            "content": "Life is full of choices. You make different choices everyday. For example, at the end of this review you will choose whether this review was helpful or not. Or you would skip that and choose whether to watch this anime or not. Similarly, Amakusa Kanade, the protagonist of Noucome, also faces choices to make everyday but the options he has to choose from are kinda twisted.\r\n\"My Mental Choices are Completely Interfering with my School Romantic Comedy\" (this name is pretty long so I'll refer to it by it's shorter name Noucome) is about a young second year high school student Amakusa Kannade who, despite hisrelatively good looks, is considered a weirdo in his school. The reason is the plot of this anime. Amakusa has a curse which he named 'Absolute Choice'. Due to this curse, at any random moment a few choices will pop up in front of him. These choices are almost always ridiculous and eventually lead to situations where Amakusa makes a fool of himself. One of these choices made a blonde girl fall from the sky to help him with his curse. Around that time, he got a phone call from God (seriously, the caller id said God or Kami) who said he would help him get rid of the curse. This is where all the comedy really starts. Let me tell the plot in a different way, Noucome is the story of young high school boy's life made miserable with the interference of some Gods.\\n\\n\r\nNoucome is a comedy anime with a little ecchi. Although MAL does not categorize it as ecchi, it has scenes which could make it an ecchi anime. The story is well planned. It is made of random events leading to a single goal i.e Amakusa getting rid of his curse. This style is similar to that of another anime, B Gata H Kei, in which all of Yamada's actions were leading to a single goal, having sex (i'm sure most ecchi watchers know of this anime). Some might think that the comedy in Noucome is stupid and senseless, but it is this large amount of comedy which makes Noucome fun to watch. Every episode is loaded with funny scenes which are sure to give you a good laugh. One thing worth mentioning here is that Noucome is your typical harem anime with a boy surrounded by girls who eventually fall in love with him. So don't expect uniqueness in terms of harem here. However, the unique storyline and loads of comedy make this anime awesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter building in Noucome is perfect. As the series progresses, you get to know more about the characters. Everything you need to know about the characters is told or shown so you get to know the characters much better. Every character has its own unique and funny personality. All characters, both major and minor, are there to give you a good laugh. The artwork is pretty good. The characters are well made. There's not much to talk about here as almost all animes nowadays have pretty much the same type of artwork. The voice acting is also well done the voices fit the characters perfectly. The OP and ED songs are pretty nice and fun to listen.\\n\\n\r\nNoucome is a great and fun anime. It's 10 episodes of pure comedy combined with a good story. Once you start watching it, I'm sure you'll want to complete it. It's sure to give you a good laugh.\\n\\n\r\nWell that's pretty much it. I know it's not perfect but it's all I could do. Let me know what you think of it and if there are any suggestions you would like to give, feel free to do so. Thank you for reading! I hope my review was helpful (^-^).",

            "content": "To start off, this easily became one of my favorite anime. Having watched this the first time November 2013 when it had only like 3 or 4 episodes aired, I was expecting this series to last for around 20+ episodes. However, my high hopes were crushed when I saw at the end of episode 9 that the next will be the final one.\r\nStory: 9\r\nWhile many people think the series' story is pointless, I personally like it and I think it is one of the strong points of this anime in which the humor and enjoyment is crafted from. Also, personally, I like anime with OPbeing cursed and thus rendered helpless, so it could be a factor on why I gave a 9.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is good. I liked all the character designs, especially Ouka, Chocolat, and Seira. Not much to say here, though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nOP and ED is especially terrific! OP matched the series well, being bouncy and all. ED is one of my favorite songs now, but it seemed to be out of place for the anime. Still, thumbs up.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nI liked all the characters' personalities, but not enough to give a 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nAll episodes never failed to make me laugh out loud in one point or another.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\n-1 for incomplete material. Overall, it's a very nice anime. I really really hope for a 2nd season, but I highly doubt it with the things they are now.",

Idiot protagonist and retarded heroine with the ultimate selling point was the super huge plotholes and poor storyboard...\r\nI was wrong....\r\nWell, it does have some pretty generic harem themed story, but the idea was not that bad, and the most important point is that this anime doesn't try to randomly combine a serious story and random jokes all together like some \"nowadays\" romance comedy. It's like... maybe, seto no hanayome? Totally random with pure comedy and cheesy romance. The show that requires you shut your brain off andwatch while laughing like crazy.\\n\\n\r\nSome other \"nowadays\" anime like D*L have done a very serious mistake trying to combine the seriousness of the story and random things with poor writings of the story. This anime don't do that. It's pure comedy, and if you try to use your brain here, you'll hate this anime. (anime like D*L sometimes include serious business inside of the story which requires you to turn your brain on and ended up screaming all the time out of randomness that's combined with the serious plot but get seriously flawed).\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, here's the score:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nI'd give 7.5/10. But with that kind of ending? Meh, 6/10 is good enough.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nNo kidding. It's good. Enough said.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nMOE cultured music(?) or something like that? Usually I'm not really into that kind of music, but this time, it's different. I'd give 8/10 for the awesomeness.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nGeneric tsundere? Check. Generic dere-dere? Check. Generic (what do you call a sweet onee-chan type?) sweet type? Check. Generic imouto? Check.\\n\r\nBut why 9 points?? Well, all the checked personalities are side characters the main protagonist usually messing up with. The main heroines? Unique combination is something that I'd like to say, but you could still sense the common traits though. But still, they are pretty loveable and you'll find a hard time choosing between them. (lol nope, Furano FTW)\\n\r\nAlso the main protagonist-kun isn't a helpless little brat who clings on other's help to be able to live. The only thing you'll get annoyed from this protagonist-kun is that he's fckin dense at romantic feelings. Well, he isn't allowed to love anyone though...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.5/10\\n\r\nPerfection. Wait, no. \\n\r\nYes, I was laughing like crazy almost fell out of the chair, but wtf with the ending. Just the ending alone is enough to subtract a 0.5 point from the total enjoyment score. FIX THE ENDING, DAMN IT. Or make the 2nd season. pls(?)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nBy far, noucome is one of some very few \"nowadays\" comedy anime which able to satisfy my taste. It doesn't need to have a serious and mindblowing plots and storyboard. Those two aspects are hard to combined. Hataraku Maou-sama is a extremely rare example of the combination that ended up great. Just a pure comedy romance is enough. As long as the writing doesn't get screwed up, then it'll be good.",

Do not read the review but be forced to watch Boku No Pico in Fullscreen HD.\r\nOre no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru is a comedy, school and romance anime who some might enjoy and others might not, i defintely enjoyed this anime.\r\nStory (7)\r\nThe story is about a boy named Kanade Amakusa who is a high school student, at first glance he looks like a average handsome boy but he is cursed with the curse \"AbsoluteChoices.\" This curse makes him have to choose one of the choices that can appear at anytime. If he does not pick a choice he will receive a large amout of pain. Because of this curse people think he is a pervert and wierd, the curse ruined his reputation with everyone around him, but one day he gets stopped to choose one of the 2 options and a girl falls out of the sky.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not the best but does not go behind other animes, the art is bright and cheerful and has that comedian feel to it. There werent any slow/bad and lazy animations. The backgrounds were detailed and didnt look any bad at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8)\\n\\n\r\nI personally really love the opening, and the ending was fairly good. The handstands were really good on the openings as it showed physics and that the characters tried to balance themselves. The scenes is a bit wierd but they fit the anime. The one singing wasnt bad either. The ending wasnt bad either but i personally like the opening more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9)\\n\\n\r\nI really love the characters as each character has a special trait or something that makes them diffrent from the other characters. The main characters are Kanade Amakusa and 3 other female characters which starts with Furano Yukihira who seems wierd and is quiet on the outside with a wierd sense of humor but on the inside she is shy and cute, there is Ouka Yuuouji who is a cheerful, energized, airhead and a happy girl however she is really pure. Then there is Chocolat who loves snacks, dinner and most food. She is really big airhead and is really useless to our main character Kanade.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10)\\n\\n\r\nI had a blast watching through this anime, i was suprised by how much i laughed as i dont really have a really good sense of humor. I most definetly enjoyed this anime alot. It was fun ride to watch tho i am disappointed that there were only 10 episodes, i was hoping there would be 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8.5)\\n\\n\r\nI gave this a rating of (8.5) because i belive it fits the rating really good, the story was uniqe but pretty average. The art wasnt bad, the sound was really good and the characters were great. This anime shines through it comedy, but it is also a romcom so if you like these type of animes you must watch it. \\n\r\nYou will not be disappointed one bit other than the lack of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nChoose\\n\\n\r\n1. Rate this helpful and watch the anime no matter what.\\n\\n\r\n2 Rate this not helpful and get a huge boulder from the sky crashing into you.\\n\\n\r\n3. The Galaxy and Beyond.\\n\\n",

            "content": "When you're bored and have absolutely nothing to do, this anime is definitely worth checking out. Although it's short, it delivers the same amount of pleasure as any other series.\r\nI guess you'd have to have some twisted taste but it's simple yet, creative plot was entertaining to watch. I found myself laughing because of how random some scenes were. For example, in the first episode (this isn't a spoiler) the way they portray how decisions in the past have affected the modern world was so funny; no other way to word it. Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison and even Shakespeare were featured comedically. It's a refreshingbreak from the usual \"serious\" atmosphere given off of a slice of life series. \\n\\n\r\nInitially, this anime seems rather stupid and pointless.. and i'm not denying it. It was completely ridiculous (in a good way XD) But, i couldn't help but fall in love with the characters and the art. Although they included so many different personalities, i didn't find it confusing at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around Amakusa Kanade, just your average student blessed with an unimaginable curse that requires him to decide between two choices on the spot otherwise suffering from severe migraines. Might i say, the choices he has to decide between on a daily basis are equally ridiculous everytime. \\n\\n\r\n Despite all his efforts of leading a normal life, he is labelled as a pervert, weirdo and even \"imouto-fyer\" (lol that one made me laugh) The rest of his gang (a.k.a. The Fail Five) are composed of an overly conscious tsundere with a odd sense of humour- always coming up with the weirdest puns, a spunky and cheerful airhead, and a mysteriously glutinous girl who fell from the sky claiming to be his pet sent from heaven to help him lift his curse? \\n\\n\r\nWhat i liked:\\n\r\n- the art was on point\\n\r\n- the variety of characters (epecially Yukihira)",

What is it saying?????????\r\nErabe:\r\n1. I am to make a long review of \"Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru.\"\r\n2. I am to make a short review of \"Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru\" about 2 lines long.\r\n3. I'm not gonna make a \"Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru\" review.\r\nLet's see,hummmmmmmm. AH SHUT UP YOU PINCHE ABSOLUTE  CHOICE WHOEVER YOU ARE, I'LL MAKE IT THE WAY I WANTED.......sorry about the troll guys.\\n\\n\r\nSo without any further adieu:\\n\\n\r\nStory: Poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nFrankly, the story plot was, ehhhhh, just very simple and in fact it was pretty obvious that is was copied from another anime \"Kaminomi\" and they just added some twist in it. Also, the entire thing was solely focus on the poor guy's curse and the predicament he has to undergo.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Very Good 8.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so I'm guilty of the fan-service that this anime provides, even though there are some censoring in it, also I like the way Ouka, Chocolat and that big boob bimbo Reikaidou were drawn and that's about it. There is of course the swimsuit fan-service where Ouka, Chocolat and Reikaidou are the bomb.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Mediocre 6.\\n\\n\r\nI just don't have anyway of commenting on it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nAt one point I do find Kanade's predicament funny, but in the last episode, I'm pretty much disgusted that he didn't choose among Ouka, Furano and Chocolat and instead chooses the part where he has to stay with his curse for a little longer. As for the girls, I'm a bit disgusted that studio Diomedea, has misled us audiences as to the guy's harem, though Seira, Konagi, Reikaidou and Yuragi were featured, the focus was more on Ouka, Furano and Chocolat. Chocolat, at one point where she becomes a normal, intelligent and caring girl was something that has made me like her, compared to her retard form which annoys me, Ouka on the other hand is somewhat to be should have been Kanade's love interest, Furano......I just don't like her, she maybe sweet when she is by her lonesome, but her tsundere attitude was a turn off for me. Also, this anime failed to provide any hint as to who Seira is aside from being the student council president, in fact I wondered if she is that voice that gives Kanade that absolute choice curse thing, because of these scenarios,  I just limit this anime's category to six.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nOk, I'm just gonna say it this way:\\n\\n\r\n1. It was funny.\\n\\n\r\n2. I like the fanservice.\\n\\n\r\n3. I like the way Ouka's cutness, though Chocolat is annoying, she cute anyway and I kinda like the way she express herself to Kanade, but only if she stayed as this normal, intelligent and caring girl. Despite of Furano's tsundere attitude she is still funny enough provide the laughs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nTbh, though this anime is funny, there are some parts that were misleading, such as the opening theme, where we see Kanade wanting to whack Furano, but never happen, thank god, the swimsuit that were conflicting with the opening and the last 2 episodes and its lack of originality, basically it was this anime's lack of originality and it reliance on the main character getting wooped and being stupid where the reasons that I gave this anime such score.",

            "content": "UGH, why anime industry do you have to ruin everything semi-original lately?\r\nStory: 6\r\nI will start off saying points for originality, BUT massive reductions for shitting all over it. What we have is a guy who was spontaneously cursed with something called \"Absolute Choice\". Absolute Choice erratically chooses two things that are pertaining to the situation around him most of the time. If he tries to not pick one or takes too long deciding it starts to hurt him until he chooses. This sounds great for a really original setting in a comedy. Where this fails is unsurprisingly fanservice. Nearly every single choice he has tomake relates to him having to do something that results in fanservice to some extent. While at first this show is pretty damn funny it quickly falls off into a repetitive scenario where Absolute Choice is going to come up at the worst time and he'll have to do something most likely sexual. Throw in a generic harem cast and plots, and then you get whatever this is trying to be. This is a massive let down because reading the synopsis I was expecting something hilarious and new, but it's just another harem with a small twist. Also later in the show he randomly has three or four choices which just comes out of nowhere without any explanation.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is fine, and the characters are your usual fare. Nothing looks particularly bad, but nothing stands out. It looks clean and the characters are nice to look at. It's pretty colorful which is something I always find fun to watch. There are a few times where the designs of the art style changes and it contributes to the comedy, but again nothing that's unique among other shows in the medium. Then we got the constant fanservice shots where you see panties when you shouldn't etc. Nothing new there either. I will say that the OP is pretty interesting and if nothing else I enjoyed it for being a little weird, yet still suiting the show in it's own original way.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe characters voices are all mediocre, I don't have any characters I can even remember the voices of outside of Yukihira because she has a few scenes where she acts differently than normal and changes her voice. The music itself is all meh. Nothing special or good enough to remember just plain anime music. Sound effects are all the usual anime ones with random noises added for comedic effect. If there's one thing you will remember after watching this is, \"ERABE!\". Which will be said repeatedly every episode by the Absolute choice voice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\\n\r\nWith a plot centered around being forced to make insane decisions at random this had room to be great. It wasn't. All the characters are tropes we've all seen in anime, and again they do nothing new with them. Being forced into these decisions could have serious mental consequences. But nothing happened with it outside of there's a way to get rid of it HURRRR; so the main character has random goals instead of trying to cope with his problem. Especially the main character just being the average comedy/harem main that doesn't do much of anything different other than make ridiculous decisions without anyone knowing why. This is comical most of the time, but all the characters are bland with minimal development leading to a show that just falls flat and gets boring and repetitive fast unless you take watching it slow which is hard to do since it's only ten episodes long.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overview: 7/6\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show wasn't what I wanted it to be it is still something original, and worth watching if you can handle the overly stupid fanservice. There are some hilarious moments, but overall it's nothing that impressive. If you want a great comedy this isn't it, there are much better options out there and don't let the synopsis full you otherwise. However if you want a funny show with a lil romance and fanservice this does it well. It's not inherently bad, it just could have been so much better and had so much wasted potential.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The life of young high schooler Kanade Amakusa has become a mess ever since he got cursed by a very humor-sensed god... His school reputation is a lost cause and on top of that he has to deal with a group of beatiful, highly unusual girls....can he get rid of his curse while dealing with them ?   Let's find out !\r\nOre no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru or Noukome for shorts is a comedy with hints of romance anime. For those more experienced in the anime world may I warn you it also has a considerable degreeof harem and ecchi... no nude scenes, but if you are someone that cant stand ecchi I suggest you pass on this one. For those not experienced in the anime world let me translate the last line for you, it has a lot of girls and BEWBS (yes, I am one of those guys that writes BEWBS, deal with it), again no nudity, but you will see quite a bit of jiggling, and even a occasional panties shot, also the advice stands, if you dont like BEWBS, try another anime buddy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAllright, all that being covered lets dissect this one, shall we ? \\n\r\nStarting off with the plot, Noukome can be tricky in this point and here is why, it has a standard \"pre-setting\" but it adds a unique twist to it, which makes the plot unique enough to not be passed as just another harem school life anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWUAAAAAT ?? what do you mean \"pre-setting\" and all that other stuff ??\\n\\n\\n\r\nCalm down young padawan, I will elaborate... Here is the deal, the orginal setting is pretty standard, we have the clueless main male character, surrounded by bishoujos (Pretty girls for the non-addicted to animes) and he is leaving his terrible school life while dealing with those previously mentioned girls (HOW TERRIBLE). Standard am I right ? yeah, but luckly Noukome adds a spin to this overly done plot, and it is the Zettai choices, or absolute choices , or the awesome voice that says ERABE !\\n\r\nThis great little twist is what makes Noukome a not so standard anime, it creates a variety of unique situations, that we dont normally see in these types of animes and the effect of those scenes is almost always extremely comical.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBUT WAIT ! what the heck are those choice-erabe-zettai thingly things ???\\n\\n\\n\r\nAhh well remembered my friend, I have to expain it to you dont I ? Very well, the absolute choices are, as the name suggests, choices that randomly appear in the head of our dear MC, if he does not choose one he gets a massive headache until a choice is made... It goes like this, lets say Kanade is going to Gamestop to buy that GTA 5 he saved money for during 2 whole months... Ahh he can already smell the blood of all those innocent civilians he will murder in the game... Anyway, once he gets there, he is about to grab the cd and BANG ! A voice in his heads ressonates sayng ERABE ! (which means choose by the way) :\\n\r\nA-  Buy the GTA 5 and at the second you leave the store break it in half\\n\r\nB- Spend your money in that Ben 10 game right next to the GTA\\n\r\nAnd then he has to choose one, or the pain doesnt go away. Simple right ? Of course the choices are not always that bad, and sometimes they are extremely absurd, or vague... It has to be accounted though, that no matter how insane a choice is, once it is chosen it will happen no matter what.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAllright, dude has to make crazy choices, got it... What about the rest ?\\n\\n\\n\r\nMooooving on then, Writing and directing ! who doesnt love all this technical bullshit ? I know I do... Anyway, the writing in this is pretty solid, the plot naturally goes in the writing, and as I said before, it is a pretty good plot, the character conversations and interactions are really good as well, we got some acid comedy gold right here folks, but more on the characters later. Another great point in the writing lies in the art of making fun of himself, yeah thats right we got another of those animes right here people ! I noticed recently it has become a trend to be self-aware and make fun of your genre, and especially of genres cliches... and you know what ? I love it ! it is extremely funny for the most part, and I dont think it has been overdone YET. That covers the writing I believe, to the direction cave ! pananana ~batman theme~\\n\r\nThe direction is pretty standard, there is no crazy wild shot or anything like that, but it does a nice enough job. Thats it, not much else I can say about this one, sorry.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOk, technical boring shit that no one gives a damn... Done ! next please.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTHATS WHERE YOU WRONG BIATCH ! HA ! there is more technical boring shit ! Its art and sound time, hurray ! The art in Noukome Is really damn good, honestly its the best, in my humble opinion, in this season, I could watch this thing just for the looks and I wouldnt even feel guilty. Of course I'm aware this things commonly come down to personal taste, I like colorful, pretty girls, judge me. Anyway,on the other hand the character design its not unique at all ( I Swear to god, Yukihira has the exact same character design as Koneko from DxD [but then again, I bet Koneko has the same CD as some other loli i am not familiar with]), but we cant expect much inovation on this front judging it is a harem-ecchi-school life anime. And of course the cliche designs contribute to the previously mentioned \"making fun of yourself\" jokes.\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime is just ok... I liked the OP ~Idownloadedittomyiphone5minutesafterlisteningitandIhavebeenlisteningtoitnonstopeversince~,(lets face it, we all hoped every single time we watched this, that Youuji panties would show) but the season has better OP's and I've definetly seen better OP's in the past, but it is nonetheless a good OP, the ED was  forgetable in my opinon, I liked when it would start playing at the last scenes of a episode but I didnt fully watched it one single time after the first episode. The OST, wasnt really memorable to me either, cant think of a track that stucked in my head or anything like that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAllright, now we are done with the technicall shit right ? Riiiiiiight ??\\n\\n\\n\r\nNO, MWHAHAHAHA ! just kidding we are done, celebrate my friend ! But whats left then ? Characters and voice acting its whats left mate. Starting with characters, first we got Amakusa-kun, or Kanade-kun, or Amachii (my favorite), or random MC no one will remember the name in a few months... Just kidding Amachhi my man, you know I like you... Anyway, Amachii is, at first glance, a standard harem MC, but dont worry, he got some nuances to his personality, sure he is clueless, but not overly cluesses to the point it would annoy the shit out of me, like some mecha dude in this season ( YES, FUCK YOU ORIMURA ). Amakusa, not only does not annoy you much, but he can also make you like him, I shit you not, the situations this guy goes through are really tough sometimes (and funny), therefore a sentiment of empathy can be developed here (although it may quicly disapear as soon as Chocolat rubs her BEWBS against him). Speaking of devil, lets talk Chocolat, this retarded,food loving, big BEWBED, fujiyoshi ( a girl who likes when the D meets another D) who literally falls from the sky on the top of our oh-so-unlucky MC... And thats it I just completely described Chocolat, she is simple but she can win your heart, trust me, she got all that cuteness thing going on, and she can be pretty funny as well. (Also, beatiful character design, cliche but beatiful, this girl is insanely pretty).\\n\r\nNext we got the loli (If you dont know what is a loli, just google it, I dont want to try to define it here and be hated forever in this site, it is like defining tsunderes, just dont do it) that cant be missing in any any decent harem, yes we are talking about Furano Yukihira ! This girl was probably my biggest surprise in the show, as soon as I saw her in the OP I thought \"hey, another kuudere (again google it) loli, good to see you Koneko-chan\", but I'm glad to say, Yukihira surprised me, she is with no doubt the funniest character in the show, her acid ironic personality is something I rarely see in animes, specially in her type of character, and her humour was simply delightfull... she even got some twists to her character that I did not saw coming, not gonna spoil it, but it was really unexpected.\\n\r\nAnd finally closing our main cast, we have my personal favorite in the harem, Ouka Yuuouji, now this girl is just amazing, at first glance she is just a mildly retarded, careless, funny girl, and that alone would already made me like her, but she is DEEP man ! and not in a perverterd way allright ? wipe that little smile of your face you perv... Anyway, what I mean is she has a lot of layers to her personalty, I dont want to spoil it, but I will just say dont think your first impressions of her are her full personality... also may I add, she can be EXTREMELY cute... really I wasnt expecting som much cuteness from this girl, but hey I'm glad I got it (again, another cliche design, but really pretty, I could stare at Ouka all day and not be tired of it).\\n\r\nThat finnaly concludes the main cast ! yaaaay ! Allright real quick mentions to some supporting cast characters : the sensei, i like her, she can be funny, the imouto girl... dafuq was that (still good though), and finally the moe (google it) girl... Just want to mention her because of her followers, that one recurring joke with one of the followers : HILARIOUS... clap clap clap, very well done.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTHAT WAS SOME HUGE ASS TEXT MAN ! are we over now ??\\n\\n\r\nNope not yet, but I promise it wont take much longer ok ? Now the voice acting, the noble work of our dear Seyuus. For me this one of the most important aspects of any animes, it is as important as any conventional acting in any conventional movie, if I may say so. And Noukome is really outstanding here, all the main cast, and I repeat, ALL THE MAIN CAST has a terrific voice acting, thats not something I would say for most animes, now dont get me wrong, I am not saying most animes have bad voice acting, they do not, all I am saying is they usually have standarly good voice acting, with normally 1 or 2 seyuus that detach from the rest of the crew and really do a remarkable job. With Noukome however all 4 main characters, plus the Erabe voice guy do a amazing job. Ouka and Chocolat are dubbed respectvelly by Ayumi Tsuji and Kaori Sadohara, these girls did a amazing job proviiding all the cuteness their characters demanded, especially miss Kaori, Chocolat voice was incredible and since she doesnt have many animes on her curriculum I hope she starts to get more roles after this. Amakusa and the Erabe guy are dubbed by Toshiyuki Toyonaga and Jouji Nakata, respectvely again. This time the outstanding part comes in the comic situations, the smooth alteration of voice tone is done exceptionally well, if you did not notice really try and pay attention, it makes a world of difference. Finnaly the Yukihira seyuu, miss Yui Kondo... just another ridiculously good job, how easy she can alterate her voice tone is incredible, and I could pratically feel with my hands the irony in Yukihira voice sometimes... really well done.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOh man you went all serious and shit over there didnt you ?\\n\\n\\n\r\nYeah I take my dubbing seriously... But enough of that lets be silly again BEWBS !! Allright sorry for that, lets end this awfully long review ok ?\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts, Noukome was a pleasant surprise this season, it has enough charm and comedy to hold you trough its only 10 episodes... probably. If you listened to my warning in the beginning of this review, you know that if you dont like Ecchi you should skip on this one, it is good but I wouldnt say it is good enough to make me tell you 'hey endure trough all those BEWBS, it will be worth it\"\\n\r\nIf you do like it, or dont mind it, I say give it a shot, it is funny, a joyride and so short that even if you dont like it at the end you wont waste much time of your life.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Others could criticize the cliched character types and lack of any development whatsoever. It'd be a fools errand to try to argue with either of these points.\r\nBut sometimes I don't need those things! If I wanted to find storytelling and literary merit in absurd places, I would have become an English major. Sometimes a troll-tastic anime full of puns, slapstick and yes, fan service, is in order. This anime is lighthearted and absolutely hilarious, and never failed to put a smile on my face OR any ofthe shameless friends I watched it with. \\n\\n\r\nYour enjoyment may also scale with your level of Otaku-ness. References to other anime, or even producers, are strewn throughout the show (bonus points for the Fate/Stay night reference). Even if these don't make sense to you, however, you'll still enjoy yourself. It's not Noucome makes sense the rest of the time anyways.\\n\\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This anime is approximately 10x funnier if you are watching the FFFANSUB sub of the anime, compared to the other subs out there. The other subs do a more literal and.. correct... translation, but the effort FFFANSUB put into making both the puns translate well (a Herculean task) and some other ridiculous translation choices make it truly a different anime experience. \\n",

            "content": "There are decisions in this world that people shouldn't have to make.  Some of these more unique decisions are brought to light in this unique anime.\r\nStory: 6\r\nNouCome (Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru) follows Amakasu, a boy with a rather strange curse... He is forced make a random decision based off two - four choices, all of them being typically bad things.  The goal of Amakasu is to get rid of his curse, and hope to separate himself from the \"Failure Five\".  \r\nThe pacing of this anime was fast, as it felt like the storythat was suppose to take over a 2 cour was stuffed into a measly ten episodes.  Too much information was stuffed into each episode and a lot of questions unanswered.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art was good, with great character designs and backgrounds looked great.  Scenery wasn't there, and animation was alright, not much to complain about since this anime is focused mainly on comedy and a comedy doesn't need the best art to get the humor through.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nTaiyou to Tsuki no Cross, the OP of NouCome, is a very jumpy song that can put a smile on anybody, which is the goal of the series.  The ED, S\u30fbM\u30fbL\u2606, begins with a small build up and leads to a heavy guitar rift.  This ED feels out of place for this anime, but KyoAni does it all the time and I quite enjoy that studio.  \\n\\n\r\nBackground music was fine, it is hard to mess up background music.  Carried and helped deliver the mood for the scenes.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nI disliked most of the characters, the only two likeable ones were Yukihira's shy half and the lazy god.  The show started off showing multiple characters with little depth and as the show went on, I was expecting character growth as Amakusa tried getting rid of his curse.  There was no character development, they didn't even give back stories to most of these characters.  Yes in a comedy, character development isn't really needed, but the way this anime started, it seemed that there was going to be a lot of development.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nI laughed every now and then, but I found the echiness to be too distracting from the humor.  I am not a big fan of forced echi, and I wasn't really expecting almost every character to have d cups.  The fanservice is a bit much for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nI really hope there is a second season, as I actually believe that this terrible beginning may have a shining sequel.  That or wished this was 2 cour, so they didn't have to stuff everything into ten episodes.",

            "content": "Before I thought about making a review of this 10 episode anime an absolute  choice just barge into my mind and this is what is asked:\r\nERABE:\r\n1. I'll make a review, because, you have to make a review.\r\n2. I'll make a review and I'll win the \"Loteria.\"\r\n3. I'll make a review, because my hermano is preparing my favorite Pollo Tortilla.\r\nOk, so I'm just gonna get down to business of presenting each of this anime's category:\r\nERABE:\r\n1. I'm gonna give the story, art, sound, and character a 7, because its good despite of a corny plot.\r\n2.  I'm gonna give the story, art, sound, and character a6, because it may be funny, but there are some that don't flare up.\\n\\n\r\n3.  I'm gonna give the story, art, sound, and character a 4, as in poor, because of all the fanservice for the pierros to bark on, and beside the main character Kanade is such a moron that he should have gone with Ouka and besides I don't like Furano.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Ok, so for the most part seems to be a mediocre one, in fact 10 % of the plot was a bit similar to Kaminomi, here there is that harem genre where the female character's weren't butting head for the guy's affection. But, I got to hand to them since it was very funny to say the least, but I can't deny that I do have some annoyance with the role of the main character, Kanade as he was this guy who can't choose between Furano, Ouka and Chocolat, but decide to keep his stupid absolute choice curse as if he is such a sucker for it. Though, it was suppose to be a romantic comedy there isn't much romance in it as the main character was more interested in fulfilling his curse's obligation than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nArt: So far the art is fine, and I'm not referring to the fan service that them dogs would howl for, instead, I'm more on to Ouka and Chocolat's illustration where I find them cute. I'm not much of a fan of Reikadou, in fact her illustration  was too mature and the same with Seira's illustration, where she looks more like a witch than a teen.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I do like the ending but not much for the opening.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Well, I kinda Ouka's rugged sweetness, Chocolat's clumsiness and I find Furano's tsundere attitude towards Kanade funny an though Kanade's predicament was also funny, at the end of this anime's last episode my goes down hill when he doesn't go for Ouka, or let's just say didn't choose any of them so as to relieve him of his curse.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, since my absolute choice for these parts is bugging me to decide, I'm gonna go for choice 2 as in the story, art, sound and character to get a Fair 6. \\n\\n\\n\r\nERABE: \\n\\n\r\n1. Enjoyment and Overall should get a 7.\\n\\n\r\n2. Enjoyment and Overall should get an 8.\\n\\n\r\n3.  Enjoyment and Overall should get a 9.\\n\\n\r\n4. Enjoyment and Overall should get a 10.\\n\\n\r\nOk...which should I choose, hummmmmmm.\\n\\n\r\nI going for choice 1, as in  Enjoyment and Overall should get a good 7.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It was good enough to be funny, but I still have to take into consideration that Kanade is annoying and there is that fanservice, but then again it was still funny and I what more can I say, it's funny, funny and funny.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I guess you might say that this is one anime where studio Diomedea should have extended it to at least 12 episode, so does this anime deserve a 2nd season? That depends if studio Diomedea keeps up with this anime's good comedy genre.     \\n\\n",

            "content": "Life is a series of choices. Even now, as you\u2019re reading this, many choices are being made.\r\n\u201cNow you there, work up the courage and choose. The very important and necessary choice that will change all of our futures.\u201d\r\nChoose.\r\n1: Read the rest of the review.\r\n2: Do not read the rest of the review.\r\nWell, if you kept reading I\u2019m assuming you picked number 1 and decided to read my review about Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru aka My Mental Choices Are Completely Interfering With My School Romantic Comedy aka Noucome, I\u2019ll be referring to it as Noucome for bothyours and my sake. \\n\r\nThe review will be spoiler-free so some things that I point out may seem a bit oblivious but I don\u2019t really want to spoil anything for those who\u2019d like to watch this.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is about a boy named Kanade Amakusa who\u2019s a high school student however he suffers from a curse called \u201cAbsolute Choice\u201d. This curse does exactly what is sounds like, it forces our main character to choose from a series of options, these options will interfere with the way he and the things around him happen and interact, with many of the choices he\u2019s faced with being completely self-degrading and humiliating. Amakusa eventually comes across a choice wether he wants his neighbor or a beautiful girl to fall from the sky. He chose the second option and that\u2019s where he meets Chocolat, who eventually starts living with him.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can guess, this is essentially a comedy anime with a very simple yet effective plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main characters are with Kanade, the Rejected Five, it includes Yukihira Furano, a girl with a particular interesting sense of humor and who likes to abuse Kanade by calling him all sorts of things and Ouka Yuuouji, your typical happy-go-lucky and really cheerful girl.  They\u2019re pretty much the school \u201cweirdos\u201d and the people with which Kanade spends the most time.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters have some kind of special trait that distinguishes them from the others, are carefully animated and above all really really funny. Whether it\u2019s from an Absolute Choice, Furano\u2019s sense of humor, Yuuouji\u2019s lack of shame or even Chocolat\u2019s lack of common sense you\u2019re bound to crack a smile or, tons of laughs as the humor is really well executed and not really repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nYou eventually discover one or two little twists about these characters and get introduced to even more characters as Kanade is forced to do missions to get rid of his curse, these missions mainly include an interaction of some sort with the cast. If Kanade fails one these missions, he\u2019ll be stuck with the \u201cAbsolute Choice\u201d forever, it\u2019s also in these missions and interactions that most of the character development comes from. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in Noucome is not extraordinary but it doesn\u2019t put the anime behind either, it matches with the light-hearted and colorful style of the anime. I didn\u2019t notice any kind of lazy animation or lack of detail in any scene. The background scenes also look pretty nice.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is appropriate but not really that amazing, the OP and ED songs are generic and the BGMs are also pretty standard, not really anything that makes me go up or down. It simply is appropriate for the kind of Romantic/Comedy anime we\u2019re talking about.\\n\\n\r\nI can say that I really enjoyed Noucome, it didn\u2019t really felt rushed and was overall a really pleasant experience that made me laugh way more than one time per episode. All the characters were unique and funny, the art was really good and the plot was the perfect setup for a Romcom like this.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like Romcoms then I definitely recommend you to watch Noucome, I promise you won\u2019t regret it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, as I bid a farewell to all of you;\\n\\n\r\nChoose.\\n\\n\r\n1: Rate this review as helpful.\\n\r\n2: Rate this review as not helpful.\\n\r\n3: Don\u2019t do anything.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading. \\n",

A lot of people would love to disagree with that statement, but let me explain. You need to have refined tastes in order to fully enjoy Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru. If you're a heretic who cries at every instance possible to complain about boobies and panties, well... this anime will be making you cry. On theother hand, if you watch anime with a laid-back attitude and you soak in all of the nuances that it has to offer, you will definitely like Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru.\\n\\n\r\nThe crux of Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru's plot is its comedy (well gee, it's not like the title gave it away or anything). The story revolves around Kanade Amakusa, a boy who carries a curse. His curse is that, at random moments, a God-like entity will come into his mind and force him to say embarrassing things or commit heinous acts. Thus, his \"mental choices completely interfere with his school romantic comedy\". Not to worry though, as although Kanade acts like a nut in every other scene, the truckload of girls that surround him are just as ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nEvery single female character in Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru is fantastic. How do you say \"extremely varied cast\" in Italian? Because that's exactly what was present in this anime. No two girls are similar, no girl is generic, and all of the girls are cute. God it just makes you want to hug them all. Chocolat, Furano, Reikadou \"Silicon\" Ayame, the Super Imouto, the Seito Kaichou... there are too many great girls to list in this anime. I tried to limit only one female character from Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru to put in my Favorite Characters list, and let me tell you; that wasn't easy. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, a quick interlude---let me give you a sample of what this anime's all about: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifKK8fjk3tI\\n\\n\r\nOre no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru is extremely ridiculous, as can be seen in that video (that video also happens to be my FAVORITE scene in the entire anime). However, that is also why it does so well. The comedy is so on point, so clever, and most important of all, so NATURAL. Never does Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru try too hard to be funny. You can tell the producers had a great time with this one (think back to the Erabe-god's laugh; god that was amazing).\\n\\n\r\nTechnically Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru follows Kanade Amakusu's quest to get rid of his \"Mental Choices\" curse; however, let's be real. The \"story\" is a pile of crap. Instead, the producers use that as quality comedy-fodder. From his mental choices, hilarious situations ensue. Just from reading the synopsis I could already tell Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru was going to have a stupid plot. Fear not, as Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru doesn't mind that it doesn't have a plot, we as the viewers shouldn't either. Just sit back, relax, and soak in the comedy of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nYou want to know how an anime qualifies as \"perfect\"? When it makes you laugh your ass off every episode; that's how. Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru single-handedly made my Wednesdays something to look forward to, and it was the only Fall 2013 anime to do so (I would usually put off the other simulcasts until I had more time to watch them, but not with this anime). And now, you too have a choice to make... to watch Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru, or not to watch Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru?\\n\\n\r\np.s. If you picked the second option... well, the Erabe-god will be laughing at you too.",

            "content": "Note: This review may appear quite long, but its structure doesn't force you to read everything, so please give it a fair try (;\r\n-1-\r\nImagine a life where nothing happens...\r\nImagine unspectacular schooldays, getting up early, disputing with your little sister at the breakfast table, chatting with friends about trivial issues, learning stuff you won't need to consider ever again in the future, going shopping on the way home, and finally fall into bed utterly exhausted as if the world has changed, but in reality you just repeat the same cycle over and over...\r\nEscaping this kind of monotonous life is not as hard as you might believe,but one ability is indispensable in doing so: the ability to make choices. First off, everyone can swim along with the mainstream, not choosing anything on their own, and therefore repeating their everyday life. You have to realize all the possibilities to make choices which directly affect your future, most of them not even noticeable and done basically automatically. To stress the importance of choices even more, you will begin to recognize their relevance just by reading this review. Have you heard of \"game books\" before? Providing a formidable way to directly influence the course of the story, you will find this review having the same option to choose your own course.\\n\\n\r\nWhy do I start with this explanation about choice-making, and how does it influence the actual anime we are talking about? In order to start,\\n\r\nread on at -5-. If you aren't fond of making even the first choice here, and you also have the guts to defy this anime's god, the master of choices, proceed at -10-.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-2-\\n\r\nTypical for newer anime, the art consists of detailed and distinguishable character parts and overall colourful backgrounds. The animation is rather ordinary, but that's fairly normal for the genre at hand, so there's no problem to get accustomed as viewer. All in all the characters keep their moe-looking appearances and please our eyes in many ways.\\n\r\nTo change into the Sound part, head for -4-, otherwise continue at -6-.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-3-\\n\r\nAs is often the case with RomComs, we have an above-average popular guy trying to keep his life in order while also having to deal with the distinctive cast of females around him. In this anime the guy's name is Kanade Amasuka; a boy who would actually possess a rather boring and average personality if it wasn't for the curse of \"Absolute choice\": a list of possible choices appearing right in front of his inner eye at the most inconvenient times. If you are familiar with visual novels, you will recognize this idea's origin at once. And guess what, these choices practically always force Kanade to perform highly embarrassing acts in front of his classmates. So why doesn't he just ignore this choice-making? Well, there's this peculiar being called \"God\" causing him immense pain upon not deciding. The same God also provides the only way for Kanade to cure his curse, namely by completing missions. Does he choose to fulfil them all, regardless of what consequences it may have for his future social life? To stress the romance part of the anime and in order to get Kanade more sensible on this matter, these missions consist of dealing with various girls in not too normal ways. \\n\r\nIf you want to know more about the female cast, venture forward to -7-, for just a small summary go to -12-.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-4-\\n\r\nThe sound as well as the music are neither memorable nor anything special, rather simply the usual light-hearted tone suited for any school comedy. OP and ED are standard as well... but at least the handstand performance sticks out. The seiyuus are performing their assigned roles without apparent fault, and although they sometimes miss the final spark of emotion, I enjoyed listening to their diversified voices a lot.\\n\r\nThat's it for sound, so either change into the Animation part (-2-), or continue at -6-.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-5-\\n\r\nAh, welcome. You've just done the first step in order to get to know this particular anime.\\n\r\nDon't be confused by its exceedingly long name, \"Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru\" (engl. \"My Mental Choices Are Completely Interfering With My School Romantic Comedy\"), usually shortened to NouCome. Adapted from a light novel of the same name, the title is summarizing the plot quite well actually. Therefore, you can expect a solid RomCom with a main character suffering over having to deal with all kind of choices he has to make. \\n\r\nIf you aren't fond of RomComs or students doing embarrassing and crazy stuff, you can either try to sit through and change your mind about this genre, or you cut a long story short and skip right to the conclusion at -15-. Otherwise you get acquainted with the main character at -3-.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-6-\\n\r\nThe enjoyment watching this anime won't reach any limit, if and only if you can cope with the general idea of visual novels, RomComs and don't mind fan service in a measurable, but not immoderate way. Coming this far through the review, you are most likely getting along with this idea and will eventually enjoy NouCome to the same great extent I did.\\n\r\nSee, to mark the occasion, god just decided to eliminate the second choice, so there's only one way to go on... that would be -15-.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-7-\\n\r\nAs with every good RomCom, you need to have a multifaceted bunch of girls providing a diversified view of the romance aspect. This cast consists of three main heroines and roughly the same amount of side characters. Within Kanade's class, we have the white-haired Yukihira Furano, a shy and more silent type who doesn't miss a chance to call him by insulting names. She has a strange kind of humour, and doesn't show it nearly as openly as Ouka Yuuouji, the class' cheerful airhead who is constantly participating in every joke and acting quite frankly around Kanade. \"There's no point in doing something boring.\"... a statement that would describe her life fairly well.\\n\r\nKanade, Yukihira and Ouka are also part of the so called \"Reject 5\", a group of the school's oddballs due to their overly antisocial behaviour. Since Kanade is forced to be in this group by the deeds of his curse, you can assume that he wants to escape his fate and therefore has a reason to complete his missions. The curse also provides him with human help in form of a beautiful sweets-loving girl suddenly falling from the sky upon him choosing it. She names herself Chocolat and causes Kanade to change even his life at home in many ways. Since she lacks some common sense, his life doesn't get that much easier even with the help of her knowledge regarding the curse.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, these main characters deliver a lot of fun throughout the whole anime, and the curse provides the needed freshness to get hooked immediately. If you feel that you haven't read enough character outline yet, go on to -11-, otherwise you may also proceed with Animation (-2-) or Sound (-4-).\\n\\n\\n\r\n-8-\\n\r\nYou defied god, your fate's 'bout to change\\n\r\nAnd no one dares to enter your range\\n\r\nThere is pain up ahead\\n\r\nAnd no mercy instead\\n\r\nYour surrounding's slowly getting strange\\n\\n\r\nWith your senses going on decline\\n\r\nBarely managing to see a shine\\n\r\nOf a more blurry life\\n\r\nNearly devoid of strife\\n\r\nOnly one way remains, go to -9-\\n\\n\\n\r\n-9-\\n\r\nDecisions can save a lot of time\\n\r\nBut only ones not including crime\\n\r\nYou have to seize the chance\\n\r\nWhich promotes the advance\\n\r\nLike I did when deciding this rhyme\\n\\n\r\nThe whole world of anime just right\\n\r\nWithin your comedy-yearning sight\\n\r\nWith NouCome on top\\n\r\nNot your average flop\\n\r\nSo now head to -14-, keep the fight\\n\\n\\n\r\n-10-\\n\r\nSo, you regard yourself special enough to defy god and the world's rules? I will give you one last chance to correct the taken path by turning round, now aiming for -13-.\\n\r\nOtherwise fasten your seat belts and continue at -8-.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-11-\\n\r\nMore about the characters, eh? If you read these lines, then there's no denying you are already quite interested in this anime. A picture is worth a thousand words, and there's nothing inhibiting you to start watching it right after you finished reading this review. Female side characters include a little sister type, an abnormal teacher and the student council, and everyone gets enough time to come into their own. Experience them for yourself.\\n\r\nStory and characters define an anime, but without the framework of Animation (-2-) and Sound (-4-) they couldn't support themselves properly. So choose...\\n\\n\\n\r\n-12-\\n\r\nEh... so you really thought that short summaries are sufficient enough to describe women? Don't get any false impressions of life.\\n\r\nIf you are now ready for the \"normal\" female review, turn to -7-, otherwise you may continue with Animation (-2-) or Sound (-4-).\\n\\n\\n\r\n-13-\\n\r\nThere's no fault in trying to swim against the current. Sadly though, nearly every world in confined by rules, and therefore you mustn't quail if a choice doesn't bear fruit. Other choices are awaiting you in your life as well as in this review, so turn your attention to -5-.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-14-\\n\r\nBut regardless, there's one thing to mention\\n\r\nSome time ago, you turned your attention\\n\r\nTo anime and more\\n\r\nAnd that's the perfect door\\n\r\nTo be able to grasp the dimension\\n\\n\r\nAnd so I hope for you to forge ahead\\n\r\nTo escape this loop, conquer your dread\\n\r\nchoose anime once more\\n\r\ndon't care about the score\\n\r\nyou've got time, head to -9-, relieve your head\\n\\n\r\n(Only read the following lines if you have completely understood the poem's intention, otherwise head to -9- as described!)\\n\\n\r\nThe first version of this review wouldn't have contained any escape routes out of this loop. But after getting the possibility to contemplate your actions, there isn't any easily understood reason for you to not deserve a new chance to use your power of choice.\\n\r\nYou may start into the actual NouCome-review now by going to -5-.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-15-\\n\r\nSo, how does it feel? Ready for a romance apart from the norm concerning its premise, exhilarant characters providing nice jokes while the poor guy gets embarrassed and the constant recall about the consequences of choices? I have to admit: recently there are lots of anime about romance stories in a school environment... but the simple difference which distinguishes NouCome from the rest is the actual concept of these hilarious choices Kanade has to make, reminding ourselves of the importance always accompanying choice-making.\\n\r\nAnd hey, this anime just has ten episodes! At least trying it won't cause any problems.\\n\r\nThe final choice is awaiting you, probably being the most important one in this review... read on at -16-.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-16-\\n\r\nAlthough you are bathing in this review's aftermath now, there's a high possibility that you will encounter at least one choice directly impacting the environment around you at least for the rest of the day. Maybe you choose to watch this very anime, \"Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru\", and suddenly your little sister bursts into the room, discovering your secret anime crush and in the end becoming your discussion partner for the newest shows. Life is a series of choices. But one thing's for sure: you won't advance if you don't choose...\\n\\n\r\nSo here's your final choice:\\n\r\n\u2022 Rate this review 'Helpful'\\n\r\n\u2022 Rate this review 'Not Helpful' (feedback is greatly appreciated)\\n\r\n\u2022 Just bid farewell",

            "content": "How we are able to comprehend something that is inherently dumb and insipid in shows such as these are let loose into the anime medium has always made me wonder what drives us into having such a thing as guilty pleasures. Now, when you imagine a show with those two terms in my mind, could you ever imagine a show like that trying to put in deep themes of free-will and choice into consideration? The answer to that question would be yes... and no.\r\nYes because something like Ore no Nounai, and no I refuse to spell out the absurdly long title, could've been thought outby writers just like in any kind of imaginative process of writing out ideas for shows. On the other hand, no because it would be impossible for an absurd RomCom like this to try to implement these kinds of themes perfectly, or at least it would take the skill of a talented writer to actually pull that off. Which, sadly, isn't the case for Ore no Nounai; but that's not to say it doesn't have its charming moments in some areas.\\n\\n\r\nThe major emphasis that the show really wants to drive its plot towards is the notion of how our lives are often being created by ourselves through the choices we make in them. Since this is a RomCom, our bland perverted protagonist is confronted with many choices that threaten his social status from girls around him, hence the title. Already the logic that is thrown at us is beyond erratic and not given much thought into how the \"Absolute Choice\" works exactly. For comedy's sake, there is an unfortunate lack of wit to the humor that these choices give to the audience in the sense that: Why are there mostly only two choices? For the record, most of the choices that are shown to Kanade aren't very imaginative or creative to say the least. When you have this opportunity to think of what you want the humor to go through, you need to bring out the big guns or else it'll just become tedious after a while.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the comedy does work is through some of the character interactions that do not involve the choice system. The chemistry between the girls and Kanade isn't the greatest because of how the girls don't leave much of an impression. There are definitely exceptions to this, them being Yukihira and Chocolat. Yukihira does come across as a vapid dandere character until she finally comes out of her shell and we get to really see what she actually is and thanks to the surprisingly well-done performance of new-comer Yui Kondou, who gives Yukihira a really funny mood swing-type of vibe to her archetype that works quite smoothly. Chocolat gives a larger-than-life personality to Ore no Nounai, despite her cliched nature when she is first introduced. While not as unique as Yukihira, her presence provides some nice needed wholehearted fun to the comedy and story.\\n\\n\r\nRomCom protagonists that are generally considered entertaining, or more specifically not annoying, are a rarity and Kanade is no exception to this fact. Not everything that he does or says are immediate eye-rolls, there are a few notable moments where he is quite humorous, but he eventually does go full force into bland, stereotypical protagonist territory where he acts extremely against the odds of what a normal teenager in the real world would react. This kind of thing would be done good in a comedic sense if the jokes weren't stuff that we have already seen on countless shows like Ore no Nounai and doesn't do anything with them than just copy and paste them into the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nInevitably, the artwork tries its best to make the girls look the cutest and sexiest that they can be.  They definitely succeeded in this domain in giving a lot of emphasis in coloring the characters that make them very easy to identify and help us remember a particular part of their design. The amount of blushing skin was a pretty nice touch in escalating the sexual tension from looking at the girls and their cute blushing faces. The sporadic animation helps in giving the humor some great traditional face reactions that we are used to in anime. However, there were moments where CG was used in some cars in a few scenes that looked pretty dreadful but thankfully there's not much to be remembered in infamy for.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the music can be construed as underwhelming in the actual show itself with your typical synthesizers, but the opening delivers a great song in showcasing the tone of the show as a whole. Even though the actual opening is quite lazy in how it was choreographed, the song at least fits well to the things going on in the opening. However, I found myself a bit perplexed in how the ending song was put into production for Ore no Nounai. It didn't fit very well to the tone in that it felt like it was more fitted into an action show than a romantic comedy.\\n\\n\r\nSurely, Ore no Nounai will be looked at as a strange attempt in trying to milk the high school comedy genre into grinding into slightly new territory. The result wasn't as fulfilling as the initial premise was shown before being released, but that shouldn't suggest that the show is of terrible quality. There isn't anything inherently offensive or needlessly degrading to anyone's intelligence, or at least the people who try to think too hard about it. It is convoluted as all hell in its subject matter and doesn't even bother to push it any further than what it generally tries to be another ecchi comedy. The fact that I'm even talking about how we look at ecchi comedies in anime in a different spectrum is at least a hopeful note in the future.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: C\\n",

            "content": "Have you ever wondered about how your daily life would be if your choices were to be dominated by some supreme random choice-generating entity? I haven\u2019t thought about it all that much myself, but apparently somebody else did, and, upon obtaining enlightment, wrote a novel based this profound reflection, and thought that publishing it would be a good idea\u2026\r\nKasukabe Takeru is the man, and Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru (NouCome for short) is the result of his introspection.\r\nThere is not much to say about the designs and animation, as they range from mediocre to subpar for theyear 2013 and never excel compared to countless other series. There is slight censorship in the TV anime version so you might want to check out the BDs for more exposed nipples and pantsu, but the fanservice is hardly ever that explicit anyway. \\n\\n\r\nOstensively, NouCome is a comedy. As such, it presents itself by employing quirky characters, some light ecchi and build-up scenes that lead to absurd conclusions. There is a story as well: MC has to clear ridiculous \u201cmissions\u201d so that he won\u2019t be the target of the random choice thing again, but you will realize it is all irrelevant very early in the series anyway. There is no real beginning to the random choice thing, as neither the time and circumstances in which it started, nor are the reasons are ever explained/specified, and there is no real conclusion either, as it simply never happens, and the random choices continue after the series ends. Maybe the OVA will fix this, but I have my doubts, and it\u2019s not like a real conclusion would bump up my opinion of the series that much, to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy itself is mostly a miss as well. For something with such a ridiculous premise, the jokes are pretty bland and uncreative, and get repetitive after a while. The whole series could be summarized in one sentence:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cERABE\\n\\n\r\nBoobs or do something dumb.\u201d *\\n\\n\r\nAnd really, that\u2019s all NouCome is about. The premise is just a pretext for mindless fanservice, the comedy is an excuse for either more mindless fanservice, or bad and unfunny jokes, the characters are all generic and unimportant: an excuse for even more mindless fanservice. The concept becomes a gimmick after a while since the conclusion is very predictable (afterall, you know he\u2019s going to clear the missions without fail in the end), and for that reason the series is not able to build any tension around jokes. The build-ups are very long (usually lasting one entire episode) and very diluted with random \u201cmoe\u201d and mindless fanservice, the jokes are really random without being weird, quirky or well thought-out and always end on the dumbest note\u2026 there is just so much that is wrong with this series that what actually HAPPENS in the series cannot be described with just a few paragraphs.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the characters are concerned, they all exist for comedic relief, mindless fanservice and are unimportant to the course of events. The main character doesn\u2019t contribute to the story in any way, he is just a victim of it and, in the end, a tool with no personality existing only for self-insert. The rest of the cast is all female, and is composed of tropes that couldn\u2019t be any more generic, bland, and poorly portrayed. Furano is the (tsundere + emotionless) /2 girl with personality disorder (not actual illness, of course, just sudden changes in personality to maximize the \u201cmoe\u201d effect...) , Ouka is the genki childhood friend that secretly has feelings for MC, Yuragi is the loli that wants to be everyone\u2019s imouto (yeah let\u2019s not talk about it), Seira is the student council president, Ayame is the rich ojou-sama (am I the only one who finds her \u201csecret\u201d slightly disturbing, considering she\u2019s in high school?), but the biggest offender of this sack of crap is the main girl Chocolat, which pretty much acts like a puppy animal whenever she is provided with kibble (sweets in her case). There is one episode (the 7th) in which she regains the memories of her past after hitting her head and starts acting \u201cnormally\u201d and explaining unimportant shit to MC to help him with his problem. I guess you could call this \u201ccharacter development\u201d, albeit contrived and poorly placed, if only she didn\u2019t hit her head at the end of the episode, lose all her memories one more time, and ultimately go back to her dog-like personality. \\n\r\nI guess that if there was one character I enjoyed, it would be Yawakaze Konagi\u2026 she\u2019s still useless and her jokes unoriginal but at least her design is pretty cute and her moments are among the \u201cbest\u201d in the series.\\n\\n\r\nNouCome is among the worst Japanimation has ever produced. There is really no content here\u2026 just ten episodes of void over average computer art 2D designs. It\u2019s not the first time anime has produced something like this, and it\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly why this is more insulting, more cancerous, and more impossibly worthless than countless other series that have been made in this vein, but it is. Avoid at all costs.\\n\\n\r\n* (this quote is courtesy of a wise friend of mine.)",

            "content": "\"Noukome is just another generic harem-comedy.\"\r\n...Is probably the response you would get when asking about this anime. And it holds true, as Noukome proceeds with the same method as many of its preceding anime: MM!, To-LOVE-Ru, Date a Live. Once you've seen one, you've seen them all. Noukome obviously has its mind set for exchanging quality plot for cute girls and second-rate entertainment. However, Noukome obviously has a directed audience to those who like watching things like this. Which is why there's no reason for anyone to completely analyze and justify an anime such as this. It isn't an anime targeted for complex thinking, mysterysolving or touching moments. This path of thinking has led many to automatically assume that Noukome is bad without even giving it a chance. The harem genre obviously has had this type of treatment time and time again. Why do you think there's no high rated harem? \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows with Kanade Amakusa, who has been popular until he's recently gotten a problem with \"Absolute choice,\" where Amakusa must choose between two or more choices, usually commanding obscene actions that no one would do in public. However, if Amakusa does not choose to proceed with any of the choices, he receives pain punishment until he does so. Supposedly, this is the work of God himself (or herself, as this anime seems to play around). The concept and story of Noukome is a play on the popular visual novels seen in Japan, and Noukome attempts to make a comedy out of this, just as it is portrayed in the title.\\n\\n\r\nNoukome does a good job with the humor aspect -- I've laughed so many times that I've considered this anime a guilty pleasure. Yes, the plot has an uncountable amount of holes, and the characters are complete nuts. You would never see any of this in real life -- which is what makes it so entertaining. Do you want a story where a high school boy makes the choice whether or not to study for his History exam? Something like that wouldn't even get past the storyboard outline. And Noukome obviously has thrown away all its sense of the real world in order to make an outrageous scenario that makes us all smile at home. \\n\\n\r\nSo why the addition of the harem?\\n\\n\r\nThe harem definitely shifts the tide of audience more to teenage guys and men, and it makes the comedy much easier to direct to. This further reasons why second-rate plot is more common, because it develops the same amount of success with haphazard ideas. Obviously, not all are to be happy, as no anime is perfect. If a teenage guy were just to seek out outrageous entertainment, Noukome is probably a good go-to. It's funny, and fits the bill for most. Noukome does a good job on what its set out to do, but that doesn't mean it's entirely good.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it's fine to have ridiculous characters and plot, it doesn't really sink. Noukome is good, but also very forgettable. What Noukome does could potentially be strong if everything was developed much better. With only 10 episodes, Noukome has very little time to set an impact on the viewer, and the sheer amount of characters and plot points is destined for development failure. Thus, we are left with another forgettable anime in which we may see time and time again every season. Noukome in particular has pretty good execution though. Thankfully, it doesn't take itself too seriously, and continues to make fun of itself the whole way through.\\n\\n\r\nLooking more into the overall quality, the anime's art is as cute as it gets. And for good reason, as many will find themselves indulged in jealousy of the main character. The girls being as cute as they are, are in quite a variety and with their own ridiculous personality. It's honestly hard not to like most of the girls. The music and voice acting is equally respectable, as they both fit their designated roles pretty well. They are not supreme, but are good enough to be attractive. \\n\\n\r\nNoukome definitely serves justice for guys who seek a comedy, but not in the way that will have him talking about it for the years to come. Noukome is more of a show we enjoy and forget about, and gives us the laugh we may be looking for.",

            "content": "Ore no nounai sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru, or simply, Noucome.  If you were able to say that whole damn first title in one breath, congrats.  Life is a series of choices.  In it, there are good choices that lead down good paths, and bad choices which lead to not so desirable paths.  With that in mind, onto the review. \r\n (That is, if you choose to read the rest.  That's on you.  I'm just writing this for the fun of it.)\r\nStory (8/10): The anime itself is just as ridiculous as its title.The story follows a boy named Kanade Amakusa, who suffers from Absolute choice, meaning that his life is basically a gigantic visual novel where the choices that he makes leads him to strange and awkward routes.  Until one day, where a blond girl falls from the sky from one of his choices, leading him to begin his journey of ridiculous quests to get rid of his choice syndrome.  With all the visual novel nonsense and random girls falling from the sky, this story is really...absurd.  Seriously.  It has pretty good pacing, and is able to \"conduct\" its messed-up storyline well in terms of speed and transitions.  Speaking of its storyline, this is without a doubt very random.  Next to FLCL, it can be considered to have one of the most random storylines out there.  Oddly enough though, this anime works very well with its randomness, being able to funnel all of that into something that is in fact, a great comedy series.  Speaking of comedy, it's all random.  I'm not kidding, all of the comedy is pretty much random moments that everyone enjoys.  Especially since the comedy is all pretty original.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10): When you look at the characters, you'll see basically any anime archtype or character class you have seen in the past.  Meaning, you'll see things like the rich girl, the over-hyper one, the little sister that says (onii-chan), the glutton, all that sort of crap.  However, there is a reason why the characters are in such a high rating, and it's because of just how funny they really are.  While yes, they are all literally copies of existing character troupes, the characters take their character type, and skyrocket their potential.  Meaning, they all go overboard with their personalities.  Ex.  Little sister character wants to be EVERYONE's little sister.  It's this kind of thing that makes this anime so great.  They basically ridicule the anime troupes through their characters in a way that makes it just so frikin' fantastic and hilarious to watch.  Although I'm a little disappointed with the lack of main male characters aside from Kanade who is denser then a friking block of lead, it was still funny to see all of the female characters in their archtype glory. The side characters (and I mean side, not supporting.  Supporting is part of what is above.) are just completely pointless, but still funny.  They add their own stamp onto the anime, with the added conclusion of throwing them all in your face by the very end.  \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (9/10): The art in this anime was done by Studio Jack, which in turn, created a wonderfully colorful and bright look for this piece of absurdity.  The characters are all VERY detailed and very colorful.  It was to the point that they tried to showcase JUST how good the art was by doing screen scrollers of just the characters eyes to show off the detail.  The sound in this anime was just as good, in my opinion.  The OP has got to be, one of the most hyper and energetic sounding openings ever.  It's just so happy sounding and absurd, that it fits in so well with the anime!  The ED was also very good in my opinion, as it featured a hyper and energetic tune that was leaning towards the electric guitar compared to the OP leaning towards the drums, due to the crap ton of guitar riffs.  (By the way, regardless, you will hear both of these tunes one way or another.  The creators sneak them in.)  Personally, I love the soundtrack with all of its glory.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (10/10): It really shouldn't be a surprise with all the praise that I've been giving this show, that I would give this a 10/10, and also why it's one of my favorite animes of all time.  It's just so frikin' fun to watch.  Bear in mind, this isn't a masterpiece in any way, nor will it ever be, but it's just one of those series' that you can just sit down and enjoy without really thinking.  (seriously, don't think when you're watching this.)  The anime is completely absurd in every sense of the word, and that's what makes it so great.  The characters are a breath of fresh air with their own twists to the story, as well as the \"dramatic scenes\" between characters that deepens the story ever so slightly.  With 2-3 potential episode names/episode, as well as little \"opposite choices\" at the end of almost every episode (I'm just telling you this so you don't miss it, should you choose to watch it), the anime is nearly unpredictable and takes drastic turns at every possible moment.  With the added mechanic of absolute choice giving random and hilarious suggestions most of the time, the anime can literally turn into any situation period.  In the end, Noucome (I'm not writing that long-ass title again), is a wonderfully hilarious series that can make someone forget their troubles, and is just fun to watch if your looking for mindless entertainment.  There's also fanservice btw, so be careful.  (Pg-13 rating is bullcrap for this anime.)\\n\\n\r\nSo, faithful reader.  If you made it to the end, I will give you a few choices.  (Choose one or more)\\n\\n\r\n1.  Vote this review helpful\\n\r\n2.  Vote this review unhelpful\\n\r\n3.  Give me a comment on how you liked the review.\\n\r\n4.  Give me a critique on how I can improve my reviews.\\n\r\n5.  Ignore all of the above and go about your normal lives.\\n\\n\r\nGood day to you all.",

            "content": "\"Life is a series of choices.\" Some choices are life changing and some seem to hold little to no relevancy in the grand scheme of things. NouCome is a series that's dedicated to taking the concept of choice and transforming it into a fairly successful comedy. \r\nThe story of NouCome revolves around Kanade, a seemingly normal high school boy living a normal life. At least until a girl falls from the sky and he becomes afflicted with the curse of 'absolute choice'. Essentially this means that he is given random choices (often perverse or degrading to himself) and he must pick one of the choicesotherwise or else he is met with a stinging pain. The story is fairly entertaining, as the audience gets to see Kanade struggle to rid himself of his new found curse through 'missions' that involve amusing scenarios, but also lacks any substantial remembrance. I could watch an episode and easily forget what happened in it after a couple hours. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation of NouCome is pretty good. If you like ogling at boobs and panty shots, you'll probably enjoy the show visually. There is a fair amount of work that is put into making things colorful and vibrant and overall the show looks pleasing. In regards to the sound criteria, NouCome is pretty average. The OP and ED were okay, but I can't think of anything that particular stood out. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of NouCome are a silly bunch, but at least they're fun to watch. Unfortunately the character designs are extremely bland and mostly adheres to the common girls with big, bouncy breasts cliche in the comedy, school genres of anime. The characters are all pretty dense for the most part and it's not like the series really puts out great expectations for characters to begin with. What NouCome does successfully is making awkward situations between characters, often utilizing the absolute choice for comedic effect. As a whole, the characters provide a decent cast for a series of the comedy genre and at least they're all pretty likeable. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy part of NouCome succeeds at providing laughs, but they are quick and don't leave a lasting impression. Most of the jokes are hit or miss like all comedy, but NouCome had more hits than misses in my opinion. The concept of fan service is no stranger to this show and it bounces (literally) in and out consistently. If you're looking for some quick comedy with constant cleavage and panty angles, NouCome delivers it. It's a bit of a shame that this show was so immensely unpopular and sold horribly in Japan because NouCome was actually a decent comedy.",

            "content": "Life is full of choices. You make different choices everyday. For example, at the end of this review you will choose whether this review was helpful or not. Or you would skip that and choose whether to watch this anime or not. Similarly, Amakusa Kanade, the protagonist of Noucome, also faces choices to make everyday but the options he has to choose from are kinda twisted.\r\n\"My Mental Choices are Completely Interfering with my School Romantic Comedy\" (this name is pretty long so I'll refer to it by it's shorter name Noucome) is about a young second year high school student Amakusa Kannade who, despite hisrelatively good looks, is considered a weirdo in his school. The reason is the plot of this anime. Amakusa has a curse which he named 'Absolute Choice'. Due to this curse, at any random moment a few choices will pop up in front of him. These choices are almost always ridiculous and eventually lead to situations where Amakusa makes a fool of himself. One of these choices made a blonde girl fall from the sky to help him with his curse. Around that time, he got a phone call from God (seriously, the caller id said God or Kami) who said he would help him get rid of the curse. This is where all the comedy really starts. Let me tell the plot in a different way, Noucome is the story of young high school boy's life made miserable with the interference of some Gods.\\n\\n\r\nNoucome is a comedy anime with a little ecchi. Although MAL does not categorize it as ecchi, it has scenes which could make it an ecchi anime. The story is well planned. It is made of random events leading to a single goal i.e Amakusa getting rid of his curse. This style is similar to that of another anime, B Gata H Kei, in which all of Yamada's actions were leading to a single goal, having sex (i'm sure most ecchi watchers know of this anime). Some might think that the comedy in Noucome is stupid and senseless, but it is this large amount of comedy which makes Noucome fun to watch. Every episode is loaded with funny scenes which are sure to give you a good laugh. One thing worth mentioning here is that Noucome is your typical harem anime with a boy surrounded by girls who eventually fall in love with him. So don't expect uniqueness in terms of harem here. However, the unique storyline and loads of comedy make this anime awesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter building in Noucome is perfect. As the series progresses, you get to know more about the characters. Everything you need to know about the characters is told or shown so you get to know the characters much better. Every character has its own unique and funny personality. All characters, both major and minor, are there to give you a good laugh. The artwork is pretty good. The characters are well made. There's not much to talk about here as almost all animes nowadays have pretty much the same type of artwork. The voice acting is also well done the voices fit the characters perfectly. The OP and ED songs are pretty nice and fun to listen.\\n\\n\r\nNoucome is a great and fun anime. It's 10 episodes of pure comedy combined with a good story. Once you start watching it, I'm sure you'll want to complete it. It's sure to give you a good laugh.\\n\\n\r\nWell that's pretty much it. I know it's not perfect but it's all I could do. Let me know what you think of it and if there are any suggestions you would like to give, feel free to do so. Thank you for reading! I hope my review was helpful (^-^).",

            "content": "To start off, this easily became one of my favorite anime. Having watched this the first time November 2013 when it had only like 3 or 4 episodes aired, I was expecting this series to last for around 20+ episodes. However, my high hopes were crushed when I saw at the end of episode 9 that the next will be the final one.\r\nStory: 9\r\nWhile many people think the series' story is pointless, I personally like it and I think it is one of the strong points of this anime in which the humor and enjoyment is crafted from. Also, personally, I like anime with OPbeing cursed and thus rendered helpless, so it could be a factor on why I gave a 9.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is good. I liked all the character designs, especially Ouka, Chocolat, and Seira. Not much to say here, though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nOP and ED is especially terrific! OP matched the series well, being bouncy and all. ED is one of my favorite songs now, but it seemed to be out of place for the anime. Still, thumbs up.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nI liked all the characters' personalities, but not enough to give a 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nAll episodes never failed to make me laugh out loud in one point or another.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\n-1 for incomplete material. Overall, it's a very nice anime. I really really hope for a 2nd season, but I highly doubt it with the things they are now.",

            "content": "Oh look, noucome... another generic harem anime... Nope, not gonna watch it... Gotta be like another D*L anyway... Idiot protagonist and retarded heroine with the ultimate selling point was the super huge plotholes and poor storyboard...\r\nI was wrong....\r\nWell, it does have some pretty generic harem themed story, but the idea was not that bad, and the most important point is that this anime doesn't try to randomly combine a serious story and random jokes all together like some \"nowadays\" romance comedy. It's like... maybe, seto no hanayome? Totally random with pure comedy and cheesy romance. The show that requires you shut your brain off andwatch while laughing like crazy.\\n\\n\r\nSome other \"nowadays\" anime like D*L have done a very serious mistake trying to combine the seriousness of the story and random things with poor writings of the story. This anime don't do that. It's pure comedy, and if you try to use your brain here, you'll hate this anime. (anime like D*L sometimes include serious business inside of the story which requires you to turn your brain on and ended up screaming all the time out of randomness that's combined with the serious plot but get seriously flawed).\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, here's the score:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nI'd give 7.5/10. But with that kind of ending? Meh, 6/10 is good enough.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nNo kidding. It's good. Enough said.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nMOE cultured music(?) or something like that? Usually I'm not really into that kind of music, but this time, it's different. I'd give 8/10 for the awesomeness.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nGeneric tsundere? Check. Generic dere-dere? Check. Generic (what do you call a sweet onee-chan type?) sweet type? Check. Generic imouto? Check.\\n\r\nBut why 9 points?? Well, all the checked personalities are side characters the main protagonist usually messing up with. The main heroines? Unique combination is something that I'd like to say, but you could still sense the common traits though. But still, they are pretty loveable and you'll find a hard time choosing between them. (lol nope, Furano FTW)\\n\r\nAlso the main protagonist-kun isn't a helpless little brat who clings on other's help to be able to live. The only thing you'll get annoyed from this protagonist-kun is that he's fckin dense at romantic feelings. Well, he isn't allowed to love anyone though...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.5/10\\n\r\nPerfection. Wait, no. \\n\r\nYes, I was laughing like crazy almost fell out of the chair, but wtf with the ending. Just the ending alone is enough to subtract a 0.5 point from the total enjoyment score. FIX THE ENDING, DAMN IT. Or make the 2nd season. pls(?)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nBy far, noucome is one of some very few \"nowadays\" comedy anime which able to satisfy my taste. It doesn't need to have a serious and mindblowing plots and storyboard. Those two aspects are hard to combined. Hataraku Maou-sama is a extremely rare example of the combination that ended up great. Just a pure comedy romance is enough. As long as the writing doesn't get screwed up, then it'll be good.",

Do not read the review but be forced to watch Boku No Pico in Fullscreen HD.\r\nOre no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru is a comedy, school and romance anime who some might enjoy and others might not, i defintely enjoyed this anime.\r\nStory (7)\r\nThe story is about a boy named Kanade Amakusa who is a high school student, at first glance he looks like a average handsome boy but he is cursed with the curse \"AbsoluteChoices.\" This curse makes him have to choose one of the choices that can appear at anytime. If he does not pick a choice he will receive a large amout of pain. Because of this curse people think he is a pervert and wierd, the curse ruined his reputation with everyone around him, but one day he gets stopped to choose one of the 2 options and a girl falls out of the sky.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not the best but does not go behind other animes, the art is bright and cheerful and has that comedian feel to it. There werent any slow/bad and lazy animations. The backgrounds were detailed and didnt look any bad at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8)\\n\\n\r\nI personally really love the opening, and the ending was fairly good. The handstands were really good on the openings as it showed physics and that the characters tried to balance themselves. The scenes is a bit wierd but they fit the anime. The one singing wasnt bad either. The ending wasnt bad either but i personally like the opening more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9)\\n\\n\r\nI really love the characters as each character has a special trait or something that makes them diffrent from the other characters. The main characters are Kanade Amakusa and 3 other female characters which starts with Furano Yukihira who seems wierd and is quiet on the outside with a wierd sense of humor but on the inside she is shy and cute, there is Ouka Yuuouji who is a cheerful, energized, airhead and a happy girl however she is really pure. Then there is Chocolat who loves snacks, dinner and most food. She is really big airhead and is really useless to our main character Kanade.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10)\\n\\n\r\nI had a blast watching through this anime, i was suprised by how much i laughed as i dont really have a really good sense of humor. I most definetly enjoyed this anime alot. It was fun ride to watch tho i am disappointed that there were only 10 episodes, i was hoping there would be 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8.5)\\n\\n\r\nI gave this a rating of (8.5) because i belive it fits the rating really good, the story was uniqe but pretty average. The art wasnt bad, the sound was really good and the characters were great. This anime shines through it comedy, but it is also a romcom so if you like these type of animes you must watch it. \\n\r\nYou will not be disappointed one bit other than the lack of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nChoose\\n\\n\r\n1. Rate this helpful and watch the anime no matter what.\\n\\n\r\n2 Rate this not helpful and get a huge boulder from the sky crashing into you.\\n\\n\r\n3. The Galaxy and Beyond.\\n\\n",

Although it's short, it delivers the same amount of pleasure as any other series.\r\nI guess you'd have to have some twisted taste but it's simple yet, creative plot was entertaining to watch. I found myself laughing because of how random some scenes were. For example, in the first episode (this isn't a spoiler) the way they portray how decisions in the past have affected the modern world was so funny; no other way to word it. Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison and even Shakespeare were featured comedically. It's a refreshingbreak from the usual \"serious\" atmosphere given off of a slice of life series. \\n\\n\r\nInitially, this anime seems rather stupid and pointless.. and i'm not denying it. It was completely ridiculous (in a good way XD) But, i couldn't help but fall in love with the characters and the art. Although they included so many different personalities, i didn't find it confusing at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around Amakusa Kanade, just your average student blessed with an unimaginable curse that requires him to decide between two choices on the spot otherwise suffering from severe migraines. Might i say, the choices he has to decide between on a daily basis are equally ridiculous everytime. \\n\\n\r\n Despite all his efforts of leading a normal life, he is labelled as a pervert, weirdo and even \"imouto-fyer\" (lol that one made me laugh) The rest of his gang (a.k.a. The Fail Five) are composed of an overly conscious tsundere with a odd sense of humour- always coming up with the weirdest puns, a spunky and cheerful airhead, and a mysteriously glutinous girl who fell from the sky claiming to be his pet sent from heaven to help him lift his curse? \\n\\n\r\nWhat i liked:\\n\r\n- the art was on point\\n\r\n- the variety of characters (epecially Yukihira)",

Also, the entire thing was solely focus on the poor guy's curse and the predicament he has to undergo.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Very Good 8.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so I'm guilty of the fan-service that this anime provides, even though there are some censoring in it, also I like the way Ouka, Chocolat and that big boob bimbo Reikaidou were drawn and that's about it. There is of course the swimsuit fan-service where Ouka, Chocolat and Reikaidou are the bomb.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Mediocre 6.\\n\\n\r\nI just don't have anyway of commenting on it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nAt one point I do find Kanade's predicament funny, but in the last episode, I'm pretty much disgusted that he didn't choose among Ouka, Furano and Chocolat and instead chooses the part where he has to stay with his curse for a little longer. As for the girls, I'm a bit disgusted that studio Diomedea, has misled us audiences as to the guy's harem, though Seira, Konagi, Reikaidou and Yuragi were featured, the focus was more on Ouka, Furano and Chocolat. Chocolat, at one point where she becomes a normal, intelligent and caring girl was something that has made me like her, compared to her retard form which annoys me, Ouka on the other hand is somewhat to be should have been Kanade's love interest, Furano......I just don't like her, she maybe sweet when she is by her lonesome, but her tsundere attitude was a turn off for me. Also, this anime failed to provide any hint as to who Seira is aside from being the student council president, in fact I wondered if she is that voice that gives Kanade that absolute choice curse thing, because of these scenarios,  I just limit this anime's category to six.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nOk, I'm just gonna say it this way:\\n\\n\r\n1. It was funny.\\n\\n\r\n2. I like the fanservice.\\n\\n\r\n3. I like the way Ouka's cutness, though Chocolat is annoying, she cute anyway and I kinda like the way she express herself to Kanade, but only if she stayed as this normal, intelligent and caring girl. Despite of Furano's tsundere attitude she is still funny enough provide the laughs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nTbh, though this anime is funny, there are some parts that were misleading, such as the opening theme, where we see Kanade wanting to whack Furano, but never happen, thank god, the swimsuit that were conflicting with the opening and the last 2 episodes and its lack of originality, basically it was this anime's lack of originality and it reliance on the main character getting wooped and being stupid where the reasons that I gave this anime such score.",

            "content": "UGH, why anime industry do you have to ruin everything semi-original lately?\r\nStory: 6\r\nI will start off saying points for originality, BUT massive reductions for shitting all over it. What we have is a guy who was spontaneously cursed with something called \"Absolute Choice\". Absolute Choice erratically chooses two things that are pertaining to the situation around him most of the time. If he tries to not pick one or takes too long deciding it starts to hurt him until he chooses. This sounds great for a really original setting in a comedy. Where this fails is unsurprisingly fanservice. Nearly every single choice he has tomake relates to him having to do something that results in fanservice to some extent. While at first this show is pretty damn funny it quickly falls off into a repetitive scenario where Absolute Choice is going to come up at the worst time and he'll have to do something most likely sexual. Throw in a generic harem cast and plots, and then you get whatever this is trying to be. This is a massive let down because reading the synopsis I was expecting something hilarious and new, but it's just another harem with a small twist. Also later in the show he randomly has three or four choices which just comes out of nowhere without any explanation.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is fine, and the characters are your usual fare. Nothing looks particularly bad, but nothing stands out. It looks clean and the characters are nice to look at. It's pretty colorful which is something I always find fun to watch. There are a few times where the designs of the art style changes and it contributes to the comedy, but again nothing that's unique among other shows in the medium. Then we got the constant fanservice shots where you see panties when you shouldn't etc. Nothing new there either. I will say that the OP is pretty interesting and if nothing else I enjoyed it for being a little weird, yet still suiting the show in it's own original way.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe characters voices are all mediocre, I don't have any characters I can even remember the voices of outside of Yukihira because she has a few scenes where she acts differently than normal and changes her voice. The music itself is all meh. Nothing special or good enough to remember just plain anime music. Sound effects are all the usual anime ones with random noises added for comedic effect. If there's one thing you will remember after watching this is, \"ERABE!\". Which will be said repeatedly every episode by the Absolute choice voice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\\n\r\nWith a plot centered around being forced to make insane decisions at random this had room to be great. It wasn't. All the characters are tropes we've all seen in anime, and again they do nothing new with them. Being forced into these decisions could have serious mental consequences. But nothing happened with it outside of there's a way to get rid of it HURRRR; so the main character has random goals instead of trying to cope with his problem. Especially the main character just being the average comedy/harem main that doesn't do much of anything different other than make ridiculous decisions without anyone knowing why. This is comical most of the time, but all the characters are bland with minimal development leading to a show that just falls flat and gets boring and repetitive fast unless you take watching it slow which is hard to do since it's only ten episodes long.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overview: 7/6\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show wasn't what I wanted it to be it is still something original, and worth watching if you can handle the overly stupid fanservice. There are some hilarious moments, but overall it's nothing that impressive. If you want a great comedy this isn't it, there are much better options out there and don't let the synopsis full you otherwise. However if you want a funny show with a lil romance and fanservice this does it well. It's not inherently bad, it just could have been so much better and had so much wasted potential.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The life of young high schooler Kanade Amakusa has become a mess ever since he got cursed by a very humor-sensed god... His school reputation is a lost cause and on top of that he has to deal with a group of beatiful, highly unusual girls....can he get rid of his curse while dealing with them ?   Let's find out !\r\nOre no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru or Noukome for shorts is a comedy with hints of romance anime. For those more experienced in the anime world may I warn you it also has a considerable degreeof harem and ecchi... no nude scenes, but if you are someone that cant stand ecchi I suggest you pass on this one. For those not experienced in the anime world let me translate the last line for you, it has a lot of girls and BEWBS (yes, I am one of those guys that writes BEWBS, deal with it), again no nudity, but you will see quite a bit of jiggling, and even a occasional panties shot, also the advice stands, if you dont like BEWBS, try another anime buddy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAllright, all that being covered lets dissect this one, shall we ? \\n\r\nStarting off with the plot, Noukome can be tricky in this point and here is why, it has a standard \"pre-setting\" but it adds a unique twist to it, which makes the plot unique enough to not be passed as just another harem school life anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWUAAAAAT ?? what do you mean \"pre-setting\" and all that other stuff ??\\n\\n\\n\r\nCalm down young padawan, I will elaborate... Here is the deal, the orginal setting is pretty standard, we have the clueless main male character, surrounded by bishoujos (Pretty girls for the non-addicted to animes) and he is leaving his terrible school life while dealing with those previously mentioned girls (HOW TERRIBLE). Standard am I right ? yeah, but luckly Noukome adds a spin to this overly done plot, and it is the Zettai choices, or absolute choices , or the awesome voice that says ERABE !\\n\r\nThis great little twist is what makes Noukome a not so standard anime, it creates a variety of unique situations, that we dont normally see in these types of animes and the effect of those scenes is almost always extremely comical.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBUT WAIT ! what the heck are those choice-erabe-zettai thingly things ???\\n\\n\\n\r\nAhh well remembered my friend, I have to expain it to you dont I ? Very well, the absolute choices are, as the name suggests, choices that randomly appear in the head of our dear MC, if he does not choose one he gets a massive headache until a choice is made... It goes like this, lets say Kanade is going to Gamestop to buy that GTA 5 he saved money for during 2 whole months... Ahh he can already smell the blood of all those innocent civilians he will murder in the game... Anyway, once he gets there, he is about to grab the cd and BANG ! A voice in his heads ressonates sayng ERABE ! (which means choose by the way) :\\n\r\nA-  Buy the GTA 5 and at the second you leave the store break it in half\\n\r\nB- Spend your money in that Ben 10 game right next to the GTA\\n\r\nAnd then he has to choose one, or the pain doesnt go away. Simple right ? Of course the choices are not always that bad, and sometimes they are extremely absurd, or vague... It has to be accounted though, that no matter how insane a choice is, once it is chosen it will happen no matter what.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAllright, dude has to make crazy choices, got it... What about the rest ?\\n\\n\\n\r\nMooooving on then, Writing and directing ! who doesnt love all this technical bullshit ? I know I do... Anyway, the writing in this is pretty solid, the plot naturally goes in the writing, and as I said before, it is a pretty good plot, the character conversations and interactions are really good as well, we got some acid comedy gold right here folks, but more on the characters later. Another great point in the writing lies in the art of making fun of himself, yeah thats right we got another of those animes right here people ! I noticed recently it has become a trend to be self-aware and make fun of your genre, and especially of genres cliches... and you know what ? I love it ! it is extremely funny for the most part, and I dont think it has been overdone YET. That covers the writing I believe, to the direction cave ! pananana ~batman theme~\\n\r\nThe direction is pretty standard, there is no crazy wild shot or anything like that, but it does a nice enough job. Thats it, not much else I can say about this one, sorry.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOk, technical boring shit that no one gives a damn... Done ! next please.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTHATS WHERE YOU WRONG BIATCH ! HA ! there is more technical boring shit ! Its art and sound time, hurray ! The art in Noukome Is really damn good, honestly its the best, in my humble opinion, in this season, I could watch this thing just for the looks and I wouldnt even feel guilty. Of course I'm aware this things commonly come down to personal taste, I like colorful, pretty girls, judge me. Anyway,on the other hand the character design its not unique at all ( I Swear to god, Yukihira has the exact same character design as Koneko from DxD [but then again, I bet Koneko has the same CD as some other loli i am not familiar with]), but we cant expect much inovation on this front judging it is a harem-ecchi-school life anime. And of course the cliche designs contribute to the previously mentioned \"making fun of yourself\" jokes.\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime is just ok... I liked the OP ~Idownloadedittomyiphone5minutesafterlisteningitandIhavebeenlisteningtoitnonstopeversince~,(lets face it, we all hoped every single time we watched this, that Youuji panties would show) but the season has better OP's and I've definetly seen better OP's in the past, but it is nonetheless a good OP, the ED was  forgetable in my opinon, I liked when it would start playing at the last scenes of a episode but I didnt fully watched it one single time after the first episode. The OST, wasnt really memorable to me either, cant think of a track that stucked in my head or anything like that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAllright, now we are done with the technicall shit right ? Riiiiiiight ??\\n\\n\\n\r\nNO, MWHAHAHAHA ! just kidding we are done, celebrate my friend ! But whats left then ? Characters and voice acting its whats left mate. Starting with characters, first we got Amakusa-kun, or Kanade-kun, or Amachii (my favorite), or random MC no one will remember the name in a few months... Just kidding Amachhi my man, you know I like you... Anyway, Amachii is, at first glance, a standard harem MC, but dont worry, he got some nuances to his personality, sure he is clueless, but not overly cluesses to the point it would annoy the shit out of me, like some mecha dude in this season ( YES, FUCK YOU ORIMURA ). Amakusa, not only does not annoy you much, but he can also make you like him, I shit you not, the situations this guy goes through are really tough sometimes (and funny), therefore a sentiment of empathy can be developed here (although it may quicly disapear as soon as Chocolat rubs her BEWBS against him). Speaking of devil, lets talk Chocolat, this retarded,food loving, big BEWBED, fujiyoshi ( a girl who likes when the D meets another D) who literally falls from the sky on the top of our oh-so-unlucky MC... And thats it I just completely described Chocolat, she is simple but she can win your heart, trust me, she got all that cuteness thing going on, and she can be pretty funny as well. (Also, beatiful character design, cliche but beatiful, this girl is insanely pretty).\\n\r\nNext we got the loli (If you dont know what is a loli, just google it, I dont want to try to define it here and be hated forever in this site, it is like defining tsunderes, just dont do it) that cant be missing in any any decent harem, yes we are talking about Furano Yukihira ! This girl was probably my biggest surprise in the show, as soon as I saw her in the OP I thought \"hey, another kuudere (again google it) loli, good to see you Koneko-chan\", but I'm glad to say, Yukihira surprised me, she is with no doubt the funniest character in the show, her acid ironic personality is something I rarely see in animes, specially in her type of character, and her humour was simply delightfull... she even got some twists to her character that I did not saw coming, not gonna spoil it, but it was really unexpected.\\n\r\nAnd finally closing our main cast, we have my personal favorite in the harem, Ouka Yuuouji, now this girl is just amazing, at first glance she is just a mildly retarded, careless, funny girl, and that alone would already made me like her, but she is DEEP man ! and not in a perverterd way allright ? wipe that little smile of your face you perv... Anyway, what I mean is she has a lot of layers to her personalty, I dont want to spoil it, but I will just say dont think your first impressions of her are her full personality... also may I add, she can be EXTREMELY cute... really I wasnt expecting som much cuteness from this girl, but hey I'm glad I got it (again, another cliche design, but really pretty, I could stare at Ouka all day and not be tired of it).\\n\r\nThat finnaly concludes the main cast ! yaaaay ! Allright real quick mentions to some supporting cast characters : the sensei, i like her, she can be funny, the imouto girl... dafuq was that (still good though), and finally the moe (google it) girl... Just want to mention her because of her followers, that one recurring joke with one of the followers : HILARIOUS... clap clap clap, very well done.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTHAT WAS SOME HUGE ASS TEXT MAN ! are we over now ??\\n\\n\r\nNope not yet, but I promise it wont take much longer ok ? Now the voice acting, the noble work of our dear Seyuus. For me this one of the most important aspects of any animes, it is as important as any conventional acting in any conventional movie, if I may say so. And Noukome is really outstanding here, all the main cast, and I repeat, ALL THE MAIN CAST has a terrific voice acting, thats not something I would say for most animes, now dont get me wrong, I am not saying most animes have bad voice acting, they do not, all I am saying is they usually have standarly good voice acting, with normally 1 or 2 seyuus that detach from the rest of the crew and really do a remarkable job. With Noukome however all 4 main characters, plus the Erabe voice guy do a amazing job. Ouka and Chocolat are dubbed respectvelly by Ayumi Tsuji and Kaori Sadohara, these girls did a amazing job proviiding all the cuteness their characters demanded, especially miss Kaori, Chocolat voice was incredible and since she doesnt have many animes on her curriculum I hope she starts to get more roles after this. Amakusa and the Erabe guy are dubbed by Toshiyuki Toyonaga and Jouji Nakata, respectvely again. This time the outstanding part comes in the comic situations, the smooth alteration of voice tone is done exceptionally well, if you did not notice really try and pay attention, it makes a world of difference. Finnaly the Yukihira seyuu, miss Yui Kondo... just another ridiculously good job, how easy she can alterate her voice tone is incredible, and I could pratically feel with my hands the irony in Yukihira voice sometimes... really well done.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOh man you went all serious and shit over there didnt you ?\\n\\n\\n\r\nYeah I take my dubbing seriously... But enough of that lets be silly again BEWBS !! Allright sorry for that, lets end this awfully long review ok ?\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts, Noukome was a pleasant surprise this season, it has enough charm and comedy to hold you trough its only 10 episodes... probably. If you listened to my warning in the beginning of this review, you know that if you dont like Ecchi you should skip on this one, it is good but I wouldnt say it is good enough to make me tell you 'hey endure trough all those BEWBS, it will be worth it\"\\n\r\nIf you do like it, or dont mind it, I say give it a shot, it is funny, a joyride and so short that even if you dont like it at the end you wont waste much time of your life.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Others could criticize the cliched character types and lack of any development whatsoever. It'd be a fools errand to try to argue with either of these points.\r\nBut sometimes I don't need those things! If I wanted to find storytelling and literary merit in absurd places, I would have become an English major. Sometimes a troll-tastic anime full of puns, slapstick and yes, fan service, is in order. This anime is lighthearted and absolutely hilarious, and never failed to put a smile on my face OR any ofthe shameless friends I watched it with. \\n\\n\r\nYour enjoyment may also scale with your level of Otaku-ness. References to other anime, or even producers, are strewn throughout the show (bonus points for the Fate/Stay night reference). Even if these don't make sense to you, however, you'll still enjoy yourself. It's not Noucome makes sense the rest of the time anyways.\\n\\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This anime is approximately 10x funnier if you are watching the FFFANSUB sub of the anime, compared to the other subs out there. The other subs do a more literal and.. correct... translation, but the effort FFFANSUB put into making both the puns translate well (a Herculean task) and some other ridiculous translation choices make it truly a different anime experience. \\n",

Some of these more unique decisions are brought to light in this unique anime.\r\nStory: 6\r\nNouCome (Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru) follows Amakasu, a boy with a rather strange curse... He is forced make a random decision based off two - four choices, all of them being typically bad things.  The goal of Amakasu is to get rid of his curse, and hope to separate himself from the \"Failure Five\".  \r\nThe pacing of this anime was fast, as it felt like the storythat was suppose to take over a 2 cour was stuffed into a measly ten episodes.  Too much information was stuffed into each episode and a lot of questions unanswered.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art was good, with great character designs and backgrounds looked great.  Scenery wasn't there, and animation was alright, not much to complain about since this anime is focused mainly on comedy and a comedy doesn't need the best art to get the humor through.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nTaiyou to Tsuki no Cross, the OP of NouCome, is a very jumpy song that can put a smile on anybody, which is the goal of the series.  The ED, S\u30fbM\u30fbL\u2606, begins with a small build up and leads to a heavy guitar rift.  This ED feels out of place for this anime, but KyoAni does it all the time and I quite enjoy that studio.  \\n\\n\r\nBackground music was fine, it is hard to mess up background music.  Carried and helped deliver the mood for the scenes.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nI disliked most of the characters, the only two likeable ones were Yukihira's shy half and the lazy god.  The show started off showing multiple characters with little depth and as the show went on, I was expecting character growth as Amakusa tried getting rid of his curse.  There was no character development, they didn't even give back stories to most of these characters.  Yes in a comedy, character development isn't really needed, but the way this anime started, it seemed that there was going to be a lot of development.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nI laughed every now and then, but I found the echiness to be too distracting from the humor.  I am not a big fan of forced echi, and I wasn't really expecting almost every character to have d cups.  The fanservice is a bit much for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nI really hope there is a second season, as I actually believe that this terrible beginning may have a shining sequel.  That or wished this was 2 cour, so they didn't have to stuff everything into ten episodes.",

            "content": "Before I thought about making a review of this 10 episode anime an absolute  choice just barge into my mind and this is what is asked:\r\nERABE:\r\n1. I'll make a review, because, you have to make a review.\r\n2. I'll make a review and I'll win the \"Loteria.\"\r\n3. I'll make a review, because my hermano is preparing my favorite Pollo Tortilla.\r\nOk, so I'm just gonna get down to business of presenting each of this anime's category:\r\nERABE:\r\n1. I'm gonna give the story, art, sound, and character a 7, because its good despite of a corny plot.\r\n2.  I'm gonna give the story, art, sound, and character a6, because it may be funny, but there are some that don't flare up.\\n\\n\r\n3.  I'm gonna give the story, art, sound, and character a 4, as in poor, because of all the fanservice for the pierros to bark on, and beside the main character Kanade is such a moron that he should have gone with Ouka and besides I don't like Furano.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Ok, so for the most part seems to be a mediocre one, in fact 10 % of the plot was a bit similar to Kaminomi, here there is that harem genre where the female character's weren't butting head for the guy's affection. But, I got to hand to them since it was very funny to say the least, but I can't deny that I do have some annoyance with the role of the main character, Kanade as he was this guy who can't choose between Furano, Ouka and Chocolat, but decide to keep his stupid absolute choice curse as if he is such a sucker for it. Though, it was suppose to be a romantic comedy there isn't much romance in it as the main character was more interested in fulfilling his curse's obligation than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nArt: So far the art is fine, and I'm not referring to the fan service that them dogs would howl for, instead, I'm more on to Ouka and Chocolat's illustration where I find them cute. I'm not much of a fan of Reikadou, in fact her illustration  was too mature and the same with Seira's illustration, where she looks more like a witch than a teen.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I do like the ending but not much for the opening.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Well, I kinda Ouka's rugged sweetness, Chocolat's clumsiness and I find Furano's tsundere attitude towards Kanade funny an though Kanade's predicament was also funny, at the end of this anime's last episode my goes down hill when he doesn't go for Ouka, or let's just say didn't choose any of them so as to relieve him of his curse.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, since my absolute choice for these parts is bugging me to decide, I'm gonna go for choice 2 as in the story, art, sound and character to get a Fair 6. \\n\\n\\n\r\nERABE: \\n\\n\r\n1. Enjoyment and Overall should get a 7.\\n\\n\r\n2. Enjoyment and Overall should get an 8.\\n\\n\r\n3.  Enjoyment and Overall should get a 9.\\n\\n\r\n4. Enjoyment and Overall should get a 10.\\n\\n\r\nOk...which should I choose, hummmmmmm.\\n\\n\r\nI going for choice 1, as in  Enjoyment and Overall should get a good 7.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It was good enough to be funny, but I still have to take into consideration that Kanade is annoying and there is that fanservice, but then again it was still funny and I what more can I say, it's funny, funny and funny.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I guess you might say that this is one anime where studio Diomedea should have extended it to at least 12 episode, so does this anime deserve a 2nd season? That depends if studio Diomedea keeps up with this anime's good comedy genre.     \\n\\n",

            "content": "Ohohohohohoho..... I'm still in stitches.\r\nEver since my first review of Meganebu!, I've been looking to try out another one. Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru, or NouCome, is one that I've been the most inclined to write about after finishing it. Downright hilarious, with vivid colouring, lovable characters, and a sense of immense euphoria when you watch, I recommend NouCome as your next anime to watch. And here's why!\r\n*Epic fanfare of credible facts/popular opinions (Not sure what that'd sound like, honestly)*\r\nSTORY - 6/10\r\nStory goes like this: A high-school boy, Kanade Amakusa, is suffering from a psychological torture hedubs \"Absolute Choice\", where an entity enters his head and forces him to make a choice between two things; failure to comply would result in migraine-level head pains until he made the choice. The sad (and gut-busting) thing, though, is that these choices that he makes are usually disgusting, perverted, and generally weird, causing his popularity to go down drastically, until he becomes a part of the Reject Five of his high school. And so, Kanade, along with his friends (of a mainly female cast), set out on a ten-episode joyride of hilarity to cure his Absolute Choice ailment.\\n\\n\r\nNow... NouCome technically has no plot. It's like... nonexistent. Zip. Nada. Nicht. Zilch. *However*... the creators of NouCome utilise this lack of plot to constantly dish its viewers a huge dose of comedy and laughs, and that's good, because like with some animes like Eyeshield 21 or Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita, you wouldn't just watch an anime for just primarily the plot: you'd watch it for the conflict, the tension, the suspense, the romance (if any), and the lulz. That's what you oughta do for NouCome if you want to get more of a kick out of it. Otherwise, you'll get a bit bored with it.\\n\\n\r\nART - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art of NouCome is very pretty. It's nice, it's lush, the animations is smooth and fluid, and the character designers don't have to actually draw their characters in chibi form or in a simplistic manner to indicate moments of comedy like in a lot of animes (e.g.:Nichijou, Lucky Star, Working!!, etc.) While not absolutely god-tier, it's still a sight for sore eyes after a long day.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 7/10 \\n\\n\r\n NouCome has a nice little array of music and sound effects. Their catchy opening theme by Afilia Saga, along with their ending theme by TWO-FORMULA (produced by Saeko Zougou and Chocolat's voice actor Kaori Sadohara), accompany this anime well like cream cheese on a bagel. The BGM is appropriate for whatever moments in the anime occur, and the sound effects are well executed.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 10/10 (Wowzers!)\\n\\n\r\nOh, man....\\n\\n\r\nIt was hard to pick favourite characters from this anime, because I just liked them all. Heck, even the background characters get some love from me b/c of the hilarious stuff they say when Kanade gets all weird due to Absolute Choice.\\n\\n\r\nBut, I'll list some. You've got Kanade Amakusa, the male protagonist with Absolute Choice on the brain; Yuuouji Ouka, a dear friend of Kanade, an eccentric and overall happy girl, and the daughter of UOG company's president; Furano Yukihira, a girl with a weird sense of humour and who loves to verbally abuse Kanade; There's Chocolat, the girl who fell from the heavens upon one fateful Absolute Choice, and will eat anything and everything of confectionery tastes as she resides with Kanade as his \"pet\" (Yep, she's like a bishoujo form of Gluttony from FMA); Yuragi Hakoniwa, the \"imouto\" of pretty much every single character in NouCome because she feels like it. There's also the Charagami (Flippant God) who calls Kanade and gives him his missions to get rid of Absolute Choice, Kanade's teacher who looks like a kid, has experienced Absolute Choice and cured herself of it; the Popular Five of the school; and so many more.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on, and on, and on.... But I won't. You should experience it for yourselves, after all.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10/10 (Another one?!)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is really enjoyable. I kid you not. Right next to Kuroshitsuji, Toradora!, Nichijou, and several others I can list, NouCome has reserved a special place in my little heart of ice. The romantic comedy that it constantly smacks you around with is *REALLY* difficult to take with a straight face. By the third episode (if not the first or second), you WILL be laughing as hard as I did.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 10/10 (Triple whammy, baby!)\\n\\n\r\nPound for pound, I absolutely adored NouCome. The funny array of characters, the neat looking art style, the lack of a plot being exploited for absolute hilarity, and even the attempts at romance that end up in a trainwreck of lulz; all of it. I was so pleased to watch this, and I think you will be, too, folks.\\n\\n\r\nSo... choose.\\n\\n\r\n[ ] - Watch Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru (NouCome)\\n\r\n[ ] - Do not watch Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru (NouCome)",

What if they are enough to ruin your social image? Will you choose any of the choices? Most probably a no but then you don't have an option of not making a choice if you don't make a choice your head hurts as in it's going to burst at any moment now.\r\nThis story is abouta boy Amakusa Kanade who is suffering from these random pop ups at the worst time possible. He is now called the member of the reject five(the five that are acknowledged by none) because of these choices which he has named the absolute choices. One random moment he chooses that a girl falls from the sky and she actually does and the tedious life of Kanade begins to get rid of the absolute choices. What must he do to get rid of them? I won't tell you that as it may act as a spoiler for many. But his struggle to get rid of them brings laughter to us, what more do we want.\\n\r\nNow lets look into the art. The art is quite good 8/10 for me. Also for the male watchers we have lots and lots of oppai. \\n\r\nThe jokes in the anime are quite funny and will make you laugh hearts out.\\n\r\nI would recommend it to all if you wish to laugh. Noucome is quite a refreshing anime but with only one sad point, the end is a cliffhanger. \\n\r\n8/10 for me and one of the best ones for fall winter 2013.\\n",

            "content": "Erabe:\r\n1. Give this anime a shot.\r\n2. Watch Mars of Destruction.\r\n3. Something!\r\n(Warning: choice 3 is potentially catastrophic)\r\nDon't like these choices? Be glad you're not the protagonist of this series. This guy is a literal wreck from all the mishaps that go on throughout this anime (you can see it in the way he grins all the time). Noucome has one heck of a premise to build on, and it certainly knows how to make great use of it. This is an anime that does not know how to hold back; it takes everything you'd normally see in a stereotypical, rom-com anime and blows it far outof proportion. And not only will it do so with these seemingly generic concepts, but it'll even have a few unique ideas for comedy present as well. The way this anime is written truly does surprise the heck out of me at times.\\n\\n\r\nEnough of all that, I bet you want to know more about the plot, right? Well, while it definitely isn't this anime's strong point, it is there. And it may not be anything worthwhile, either, but the plot is enough to compliment the series of events in a way that they don't go anywhere without any real direction. This anime does have a clear and concise goal (believe it or not). And, on the plus side, it's written in a way that compliments the overall feel of the series; it's zany, whimsical, and outrageous. Also, surprisingly enough, the writing does put this seemingly bleak moe series a cut above the rest as it adds a certain degree of uniqueness to the setting and romance. The only major drawback I've found with the storyline was the lack of completeness. At least I was expecting that much after episode six and wasn't really let down by it. I mean, really, what more can you expect from this kind of storyline in ten episodes? At the very least, however, NouCome actually doesn't waste any time with pointless antics and scenarios. So it's ten episodes well spent.\\n\\n\r\nThe designs in this series may not be anything groundbreaking, but they're still pretty fantastic. It was the very character designs themselves that actually pulled me in to watch (risky, I know, but I couldn't help it). I'm glad that this anime did not lose its artistic luster over time at least. There have been many series of this kind in the past where drops in quality were blatantly noticeable, but not so much with this one. There probably are a few scenes that could have looked better, but I'm not picky enough to actually notice them unless they're obvious. And there are some sceneries that look genuinely nice too, and the light-colored designs are a pretty hard standard for rom-com anime. It's almost too much of a blessing to me to see these kind of designs as I am generally a fan of it.\\n\\n\r\nOut of all the fun characters in this cast, Yukihira Furano is unabatedly the best addition to this series. Sure, you can say what you want about the quirkiness of the others, but Yukihira is essentially the greatest focus in terms of development. And while she may not have developed to a favorable degree (I blame the length), she does have a solid enough change to where I could actually grow attached to her characters and will forever hold her close to my heart. There's a certain other side to Yukihara that I just can't help but love. Between her keen insults, her unusual antics, and her social inadequacies, she certainly does have some peculiar characteristics. God, I really do wish I had more to say about her, it's a shame this series couldn't be longer. Hopefully another season will add a little more depth to her character. As for everyone else (I guess I'll get to them too), they are not too bad either. Can never go wrong with loli teachers (they're one of the many wonders in anime), excessive imouto characters, large booby girls with an ego, etc. They're all exceedingly quirky, and fun. Nothing quite out of the ordinary with the protagonist, but he has his moments at least. In many ways, I feel really sorry for him.\\n\\n\r\nAs with many other comedies, this anime will only hit home with certain audiences. The first couple episodes will be a good measure of what you can expect from the rest of this series. If the comedy in the first couple episodes doesn't fit your preferences, you're not likely to change your mind later on. Personally, I loved every episode as much as the last one. It may seem like the anime makes a slight decline in the 2nd half, but I didn't think that in the slightest. It just take a different approach to its comedy that may or may not be agreeable, but it's not bad at all. There are some elements of fanservice, but they come off as more of a parody/comedy device rather than a pandering one. That aside, if generic harem and rom-com series are something you take a liking too, this anime will not bore you at all. And even if you're not, this may be a pleasant surprise. The only viewers I can see not liking this anime are the hardcore serious types, or those that are overly bothered by rom-com stereotypes. Good thing I'm a really casual viewer, this series is a true blessing to those that don't take anime seriously!\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Score: 7/10\\n\r\nCritic Score: 5/10",

            "content": "When you think of Japanese humour (or at least this is what I think of when I think of Japanese humour), it normally boils down to being over the top and ridiculous and every way possible, which is the only way I can properly describe Noucome in a single sitting.\r\nThe best part of Noucome is undoubtedly it's comedy. It's formula for laughs is incredibly simple: have the main character be forced into situations where he has to choose between two or three different choices given to him by some deeply-voiced unknown guy. The actual comedy stems from two things mainly: the absurdity of the choicesand the absurdity of the characters. I can barely think of a joke that missed it's mark in this anime because they were so damn funny.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one particular thing to note about Noucome, and that is it's length. The length of this anime is a measly 10 episodes, which is both a good and a bad thing. On a positive note, since the anime is so short, the jokes don't overstay their welcome, so you can make sure that you can laugh from beginning to end no problem without feeling any sort of repetitivity. However, many of the elements of the story and characters don't get explored much at all because of time constraints, making the anime feel extremely rushed. There was so much more that needed to be completed to get a full sense of closure, and it just didn't come to fruition. I mean, you get introduced to a character like Karasu Yumeshima, who seems incredibly interesting and crazy and could add a lot to the comedy, but he is barely in the anime for 5 minutes, which is ridiculous to me.\\n\\n\r\nOne last major negative point I had with this series was the drama. Whenever a dramatic moment popped up, it totally ruined the fun atmosphere that the comedy provides. Thankfully, these moments were few and far between, but the addition of this poorly written drama was unnecessary and straight up jarring.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters here are something you don't see all the time, which is a good thing is this case. Basically, they are all nutheads with ridiculous personality traits and quirks that add to the comedy as much as Absolute Choice does. I do wish that they were more fleshed out than they were, but that doesn't really matter in the long run as this is a comedy anime, and as long as they make me laugh, that is all that matters. I still wish that some of them had more screen time though.\\n\\n\r\n I won't go into detail for any of them except the main character as it is better to just experience them for yourself. Even then, the only thing I will say about the main character is he is the only thing in this show that really has good character growth and a good character conclusion. Although he wants to get rid of his Absolute Choice, he doesn't want to do it in a way that isn't true to himself and/or hurts his friends. And while that is cheesy as fuck, it's a nice way to round out his character and is a nice little message to send out to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nAs for animation, let me start off by saying that there is A TON of fanservice. The fanservice did actually add to a lot of the comedic moments in Noucome, so I don't have any problems with it in this case. The animation and art itself was solid. Nothing was particularly groundbreaking about it, and nothing was gutwrenchingly horrible about it either. It was good, and that's all it needed to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack here is not memorable at all, so there isn't much to talk about there. The opening theme served a little better, as it is catchy and matched the fun and crazy feel of the anime well. The best part of the sound by far was the voice acting. Everybody did a top notch job here, but my standout performance was easily Furano Yukihira played by Yui Kondou. She needs some more roles, because played both sides of Furano's character extremely well.\\n\\n\r\nNoucome is one of the best comedy anime I have seen in a while. Even though the whole thing felt extremely rushed and the drama just did not work, it made me laugh on numerous occasions, and if a comedy anime can do that, that it receives a recommendation from me. If you like the over the top craziness that Japan seems to be known for, then definitely check this show out. If you just want a laugh, this show will still do you just fine, even though there will be parts here and there that might irk you as it irked me.",

            "content": "Life is full of choices and the choices that we make can really make a big difference in our lives. This is true in \"Noucome\". \r\nFall 2013 or known as \"Post-(Shingeki no Kyojin) season\" surely is a good season for me to watch anime. In fact, one of the anime I watch is \"Noucome\". \"Noucome\" is a light novel adaptation directed by Takayuki Inagaki and produced by Diomedea. \r\nSTORY (7):\r\nThe story follows Kanade Amakusa who suffers from \"Absolute Choice\". He has to choose which route he wants to take otherwise he will suffer a bad headache. Kanade gets to know the \"Reject 5\" who haveodd personalities that people do not like about them. After that, Kanade gets thrown into crazy shinanigans.\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogues were funny but it was not so funny to the point whereby I laughed till I am out of breath. Though it is good to have fun rather than taking this anime too seriously. For instance, Kanade says \"Please touch my boobs\". I never saw that coming.\\n\\n\r\nART (8):\\n\\n\r\nThe art looks spectacular and most of the female character designs are cute.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (8):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme SML was very fantastic. It had me dancing and shaking. The ending theme \"Taiyo no Tsuki Cross\" was alright. The voice actors did a good job in portraying the voices of each characters. Most of them sounded cute.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (7):\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I really don't have a favorite character. I just like all of them. At least they never show me bad attitudes. \\n\\n\r\nFurano Yukihara can sometimes change her personality which also results in a change of tone in her voice.\\n\\n\r\nYuragi hakoniwa, in her yandere mode in episode 7 was the best, she was like a ghost when she is in her yandere mode.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about Kanade, the protagonist. He is the most unlucky one out of the whole cast. He has to complete his mission so that \"Absolute Choice\" curse can be removed. In doing so, he gets bullied by his classmates. For example, one scene when Kanade is having a conversation in Konagi, suddenly Kanade starts to have a choice of being perverted towards Konagi. This results in, Kanade being picked on by Konagi's men.\\n\\n\r\nKonagi Kawakaze is a shy girl who requires protection from her men.\\n\\n\r\nSeira Kokubyakuin is calm and composed. When she hugs Kanade in episode 7, it was the best part. \\n\\n\r\nThere is really not much to talk about for the rest of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (7):\\n\\n\r\nSadly, this anime is only 10 episodes long and we want to have a better understanding of the characters. But what I rate is based on how worthwhile it is to watch the 10 episodes of Noucome.\\n\\n\r\nThe finale, when snow starts to fall on the beach and \"Silent Night\" music is played, lightens up the mood for Christmas as you can tell we are in the Christmas season but Christmas day is coming soon. The anime ends in a snowball war which is fun and thrilling.\\n\\n\r\nIt is really sad that we never get to see the Flippant God who is in charge of Kanade's \"Absolute Choices\".\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there is really nothing interesting to talk about in this anime, it is really a fun ride. If you are into slice-of-life comedy, I would recommend this anime. You probably might find something you might like in this anime. You probably might find something funny to watch in this anime. So I give it a 7. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime also brings a lot of lessons to learn from it.\\n\\n\r\nChoose:\\n\r\n1: Enjoy it.\\n\r\n2: Hate it.\\n\r\n3: Neutral\\n\\n\r\nStay tuned for more reviews to come.\\n",

            "content": "Wow, that was a weird show!\r\nThis is just gonna be a quick little review.\r\nStory (7/10): This is a comedy show, so obviously it doesn't have some amazing, super enthralling story. But it is an interesting concept and it gets the job done for setting up some pretty humorous situations.\r\nArt (8/10): I personally thought the art looked very good. It fits the humor very well. It definitely didn't seem lazy and the backgrounds looked good. The coloring is also very fitting.\r\nSound (9/10): The OP is pretty good. It was pretty catchy. I liked the ED a lot, too. (Specifically the instrumentals.) I don't usually notice OSTsongs, but I noticed a few of them in this one and I thought they were pretty catchy. The OST was definitely very fitting. I also thought the voice acting was great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10): The characters aren't very deep or anything, but they are very humorous and funny. I found Furano to be pretty interesting, and the rest of the cast were also very likable and funny.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9/10) This show was freaking hilarious. It took some getting used to the humor, but once I did, I laughed a lot. I'm usually one to just smile at jokes more than audibly laugh, but this show made me laugh out loud numerous times an episode. It's a comedy show, and it did it's job well in this area.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (8.3/10) After watching the first couple episodes, I didn't think I would give this show above a 7/10. But I started to find it very funny and started to like the soundtrack a lot after watching a couple more episodes. If you are looking for a show that you can just sit back and watch to have a good laugh without needing an incredibly deep story, then this show is for you.",

And i believe i was not wrong when i choose to watch Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru (or Noucome for short).\r\nI, myself, not a fan of ecchi gerne for some unknown reason (lol). But i think no one will ever dislike this show hah. It's short, it's fun, and the amount of fanservice is fair ( include panty shot and boob bounce ) and it contains pretty good romance for an anime like that, hell it even has a loli teacher.\r\nThe artstyle is good, im fine with that. However, the soundtrackseems generic, no single track that stands out above the rest, which im always looking for when it comes to an interesting anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo have you made a choice watching this anime? Remember, every choice you make will change your future. You're welcome.",

            "content": "All girls like cute things and homos - Chocolat \r\nOre no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru, a good mix between romance and comedy but this is not your regular average harem anime. It has a good plot and idea to it, t delivers a genuinely refreshing experience that cleverly combines its moe appeal with a strong cast of characters. \r\nThe story revolves around , Amakusa Kanade a teenage boy that has been cursed with absolute choices, Amakusa Kanade at random times cause a voice in his head to give him two or more choices to make. if hedecides to not do what is told in his head soon later he will get a severe headache making him choose one of the choices. he later meets Chocolat , a interesting girl that fell out of the sky and is here to help cure Amakusa Kanades curse.\\n\\n\r\nAbove all, this story is as imaginative and original as they come. Personally, I have never seen a story quite like this before, and because of that, it piqued my interest. however the only problem i have with the anime is that the ending is rushed and is poorly written.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this series is generic anime style drawn to perfection. Unique design for the protagonist,The art never hinders your enjoyment of this anime and even improves the experiences. Overall i think the art is one of the stronger elements to this anime and it definitely shows.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound for this anime is somewhat generic I would say. It sounds really adorable, I will give it that, and the mood fillers for the anime do sound good and very appropriate for where they're placed. The OP and ED I would say are good but not overly fantastic\\n\\n\r\nthe characters in this anime are all made really well and all have their own unique characteristics that make them different. for example , all the females of this anime are all mad extremely different. there is Chocolat who is a overly energnic girl that always seems to have a good appetite. and then there is Furano Yukihira who  is also one of the main characters of the anime, but unlike Chocolat she is quiet but a little weird. She likes verbally abusing Kanade and has a weird sense of humor.\\n\\n\r\ni would rate this anime a 8.5/10. I was never bored with the series, and enjoyed watching every moment. The comedy is pretty funny, I love the characters, and the story was plenty deep and interesting to keep me watching. but for the most part, I'm happy with what I watched. Overall this anime is something that made me laugh numerous times and is definitely worth watching. the only complaints i have on this anime is the fact that it is too rushed and should get another season to develop more\\n",

            "content": "Noucome (AKA, Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru) is something I found out to be quite wonderful. But it does have its kinks. \"Wait, wait, wait, if it's wonderful why do you have to go on and hate it, and say \"it does have its kinks,\" HUH!?!\"\r\nMy answer, well it's down below. \r\nBefore I start off I just want to say that if you want a more in depth review for this anime, then please go on ahead and skip this read. I do also expect you to have SOME base knowledge about this before you read it,so I can \"spoil\" some of the more obvious stuff. \\n\r\nFor those of you who actually take the time to read this, thank you.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10 (Let's dive right into it~)\\n\r\nThe story is something I found out to be quite amusing, for I like to see people fail at life. I don't mean like, \"oh wow you died, HAHAHAHAHA!!!\" I just like seeing people act stupid, like the rest of you, don't lie to yourself, you do too. \\n\r\nThe story was refreshing simply because, as (hopefully) most of us are informed, life is full of choices, and in this anime the creators STRONGLY reinforce this, just in a funny manner. Everything in this that was \"choice\" based, is pretty much there to make you laugh. \\n\r\n(Spoiler) From an abnormal school life, to coming home to a nice, lovely, sweet, cute, sexy neighbor (KEK); to then choosing that same neighbor, or a cute girl to fall from the sky... in just the first episode the story moves in a good pace. \\n\r\nI just don't understand why there were multiple love interests in a 10 episode anime, I didn't like that, I mean there are really only 3 contestants, in this love thing, but still... Plus to me it just felt like having characters being introduced to mainly just support the leading characters felt unnecessary to me. Characters just \"being there\" is sort of a waste of time in my opinion. \\n\r\nWhen the 3 love interests seem to have a moment with the MC, or vice versa, they completely build up the moment, but then end up just making it seem like, \"well that just happened, but it's not what should have happened.\" Yeah one of those moments.\\n\r\nOverall, for this being a 10 episode series, it didn't seem TOOOOO rushed, except for maybe the ending, still quite an \"OK\" story. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nI'm not usually to picky when it comes to the art aspect. Noucome had a more colorful palette, which fit this show quite well. The animation was pretty en-joyful, a lot of eye candy and fan service, I'm not the hugest fanboi of fan service, for that's what anime these days are turning towards, but I don't mind fan service. Overall, some pretty standard animation, nothing I haven't seen before, and lots of kawaii faces. \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nFor sound and music, I'm not too picky when it comes to this stuff either. Although what I do look for are a nice opening/openings and nice closing/closings, if the anime doesn't have these it's not a big deal. Although I honestly thought the opener and closer were mediocre, not too catchy, and they just didn't peak my interest. Although the sound tracks are quite good, the music fits the anime quite well. As for the voices, I thought they all were fit, and suited well. Some of the voices were a bit to high for my liking, but I could deal with it. All in all, pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7.5/10\\n\r\nI think this is the part of the show that shines most. The characters aren't necessarily \"different\" when it comes to typing them and comparing them with other characters from other anime, you simply have the standard set of characters, that you would see in any anime like this. I don't want to say that these characters were the best, or just amazing, but they were pretty good. What I liked about this set of characters is that the main characters were all pretty different, and I mean they were all really different. Diversity does wonders when it comes to characters! \\n\r\nI felt like the characters were a bit predictable, at times, almost to the point to where I probably could have guessed what happened, paused, skipped a little bit, and see if I was right. \\n\r\nAgain since this was only 10 episodes, I didn't expect too much character development to happen, but just enough development happened for me to sort of  feel satisfied. Overall, I was quite happy with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed almost, if not very close to all of this show. This show always had scenes that would make me laugh, and just make me smile and think what's going to happen next. Honestly I don't have much more to say other than, there are a lot of misunderstandings in this show, which amused me, and yet made me frustrated. Then I think, \"why am I getting so worked up about this?\" Because of a certain tsundere, that's why. I honestly hate her. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict 7/10    (7.5/10?!)\\n\r\nIf I could rate this at a 7.4-7.6 I would. I just feel like giving it an 8 as an overall score is too high. And at the same time I also feel like giving it a 7 is just not doing it justice. The story and plot is amusing and funny, it can also be intriguing at times. And the characters play very well off of this story, I actually liked watching this.\\n\r\nI recommend this to people who want to watch something short, and funny. Something you don't have to invest much thought into afterwards. At the same time you have to be able to take dumb jokes and inappropriate/immature things like a man. Not a bad watch, not an OK watch, but a rather sort of good watch. \\n\\n\r\n~Anime and manga rot minds, just make sure to watch and read anyways.~",

            "content": "Just to be clear, 5 isn't a bad score; I'm only saying this show is average.\r\nHarems have always had a bad reputation among people due to their lack of originality. Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Comedy wo Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru, or NouKome, is no different and is almost exactly what you would expect it to be. It's definitely nothing groundbreaking, as most would expect from a harem, ecchi show. I was originally pretty hyped for this show because the synopsis was interesting and I thought this \"absolute choice\" plot point described in the synopsis would create some pretty hilarious situations. I wascorrect in this assumption, but as it stands, NouKome is still generic and littered with tropes you often find in harems. Even though it lacks originality, the high amounts of comedy is something worth mentioning, so you shouldn't dismiss NouKome immediately.\\n\\n\r\nThe story for this show is mediocre, though it is actually decently original, considering its genre. The basic premise of this show is that our main protagonist, Kanade Amakusa, suffers from a condition, or curse, known as Absolute Choice, which forces you to choose between two options that appear in your head, or else you get severe headaches. Right off the bat, you can probably understand how this element in the story allows for some pretty hilarious moments. Unfortunately, even though this show is quite funny, it still lacks an actual plot. The story doesn't ever go anywhere, and even though Kanade really wants to fix his condition, he doesn't by the end of the show. Granted, this could be to allow room for a second season, though I don't believe there is one announced. This show is listed as a romance, but that's a bit misleading. Most of the girls fall for him, but, to everyone's dismay, he never chooses one of them. The high point of this show is comedy, but some of the jokes simply fall flat, or get watered down by the ecchi elements. It also ends with an obligatory, harem beach episode and its full of extra fanservice. Anyway, you shouldn't try and watch this show for its amazing story line for it has none.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is animated fairly well, but so are most shows nowadays. A strange trend that I see in anime that this show has is how everything seems \"shiny.\" Hair, clothes, and skin often reflect so much light that it masks them in a blazing glow. Maybe that's an exaggeration, but everything is still shiny. All the light also seems to have a red tint. It's pretty noticeable, however, it shouldn't detract too much from the anime. Characters move fluidly for the most part. There's really nothing to complain about. I mean, nothing moves like a robot, so you shouldn't be bothered by it for the most part. Every character is drawn pretty well, though they seem to constantly blush, which could annoy some people.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is nice, but a lot of the girls have a squeaky, high-pitched voices. It feels like all of the girls are voiced by the same person. The acting isn't bad, but some of the voices get annoying over time. You could also say the voices are cute, so the squeaky voices could be considered a positive. Nothing else of note comes to mind concerning the audio. The music for the OP and ED are actually decent, but nowhere near exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nAs you might expect, a lot of the girl's characters in this show are based on generic, harem archetypes. Though, honestly, the girls are unique in some ways and offer a relatively unique twist on their base archetypes. Let's first talk about Kanade Amakusa though: our male lead. I hate to say this, but he's also pretty much another generic archetype. Which archetype? The male lead archetype that is oblivious towards all romantic feelings directed towards him. I'm less mad at the archetype now than the fact that Kanade's barely an original character. Kanade is also kind of snarky and snide. All the girls want to marry him, and he is oblivious of this: that sums him up. Back to the girls. By the fact I constantly refer to them as \"the girls,\" you should understand that they are essentially one big character. To the shows credit, they are pretty quirky in their own way. Chocolat, our female lead, is as funny as she is gluttonous. She falls from the sky in order to help Kanade with his Absolute Choice. She fails at it and that makes her somewhat likable. Most of the time though, character's like Yuouji and Yukihira are just targets for various missions Kanade is given to complete. By the way, Kanade completes missions to prevent him from being stuck with Absolute Choice forever. I don't know how it works, but NouKome doesn't bother explaining it. He's assigned these missions by God who is pretty much the pinnacle of awesome. God is, well, God. He loses points for not letting us see his face though. I should also mention the existence of the Reject 5 and Popular 5. Kanade and much of his harem happen to be in the Reject 5 for they do strange things. Kanade is often forced into those actions because of Absolute Choice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter's don't seem to develop in NouKome. They exit the story the way they enter and that proves to be pretty annoying. Again, don't expect much from the story.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not like this show is not enjoyable. It's far from it. Characters like Kanade will peeve you off, but its bearable so we can try and ignore it. If you can get past Kanade and his obliviousness, you get to the meat of this show: it's comedy. Some occasional jokes aren't too funny, but most of the humor is chuckle-worthy. Also, most of the complaints I have only become relevant in the last few episodes of this anime, so the first, around 4/5 of NouKome is enjoyable. They really crank up the fanservice in the last portion.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Noukome is a harem that's got humor going for it. If you have a lot of harems you would like to watch, NouKome should probably be on the top of all those. It's better than a various assortment of harems, but it's still nothing special. Luckily, it's only 10 episodes. I still wouldn't recommend marathoning it, but I would recommend watching it in small doses if you're into harems. Overall, I would say NouKome is an average anime, but fine for people who like ecchi and harem.\\n\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This series may have probably been the most polarizing series I ever watched. On one hand, some of the humor was very creative, the characters looked like they had some amount of depth, and I was genuinely curious to see where the plot was going to go. On the other hand, the series is just downright unpleasant to watch. Most of the humor in the series seems to revolve entirely around the entire universe bending its will to make things worse for or main character Kanade, and the actions that occur are far too cringeworthy to be funny. Despite this, the series seems to havesome type of belief that seeing a likable character have to put himself through psychological torment just for the amusement of god himself, which may as well just be another way of saying that the writer wants him to suffer. This is made even worse due to the fact that the remaining cast is completely unsympathetic towards him and over the course of the series, you start to hate them more because of their obnoxious and uncaring attitude. The entire series is basically nothing but an extended Kanade torture porn, and it is one with a lot of unfortunate implications to boot.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, I will start with the technical aspects. The animation is decent enough and I will give credit in that the soundtrack was very good. Also the voice acting seemed pretty well done to. Admittedly there is not much for me to say during these things considering that I tend to just focus on the story, so naturally that is what my main focus will be on. The main premise of this series is basically that Kanade, our main character, has been cursed with something known as \"absolute choice.\" This causes him to be forced to choose between performing one of two actions at random, both of which are usually degrading or embarrassing, or else he gets continuously inflicted with pain until he makes a choice. Due to this curse, he ends up losing his respect at school and becomes an outcast due to him really weirding everyone else out. He then ends up gaining a choice where he ends up meeting a girl who is supposed to help him rid himself of the curse.\\n\\n\r\nThis sounds like an interesting premise, but what ruins it is the execution. For the main storyline and mystery aspect, I cannot comment on much seeing as how the series is not over yet and the first season ends with the mystery left open, and of course despite me wanting to know what happens, I do not want to sit through any more of the bullshit this series has put me through in order to do so. Of course there is a compelling aspect to this series regarding the mystery of why the absolute choice is occurring and whatnot, but it simply is not worth sitting through this terrible series in order see it.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately there are two major reasons that NouCome fails as a series. The first of which relates to the humor. A premise like this naturally sounds like something that would make for an interesting plot, but at the same time, there would need to be more than just the main premise, otherwise it will feel gimmicky and lazy. See if you can guess what NouCome decides to do with its premise? Actually that is a misleading question seeing as how NouCome executes this in the absolute worst way possible.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing as how we know nothing about why or how these choices occur at random points, there is basically no other way to interpret them other than the author deliberately trying to pick whichever ones are making things things the most inconvenient for the main character, and due to the way this is executed, you would think the author holds some type of personal grudge against his own character. Now as ridiculous an interpretation as this may sound, I have to ask if the series in universe explanation is any better? In this series, the current god is someone who is filling in for the previous god who ended up becoming a shut in, yet the god before her is the one that is causing the absolute choice. We are given several things that are also meant to imply that the shut in god is actually a certain character in the series who has put the main character through even more crap just for her own amusement, and is someone that finds physically and psychologically tormenting someone else funny.\\n\\n\r\nSo answer me this, does the author of an anime series technically not have the same position as a god would? Hell the series is basically about the laws of the universe literally turning themselves over just to torture Kanade, therefore there is some type of divine intervention, yet we are never told anything about the third god and he/she is not even a character yet. However, it honestly feels as though this third god is meant to represent the author himself, or in this case even being a self insert.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering that the only reason these events happen is basically because \u201cfuck you that\u2019s why,\u201d and that this god is not even made out to be an antagonist and the fact that we are supposed to find this type of crap funny, I can only assume that the author is projecting his own personal ideas onto this unrevealed character, and I have no reason to assume otherwise until Takeru Kasukabe proves he knows how to write a story and gives a decent justification. Honestly that is what a revelation would have to be at this point. It would not be a twist, or a revelation, it would have to be a reason why this crap has happened, and if it does not, then the only way it would work is if we see the person who causes this get repaid the favor tenfold.\\n\\n\r\nThere is ultimately a correct way to handle this type of plot, and that way would be if the person that dealt with all this crap was a complete asshole who deserved to have this happen to them. Seeing good people suffer due to someone else\u2019s cruelty is not funny. In fact, it is the exact opposite of funny. It is typically used as a storytelling tool to increase tension and drama. You end up sympathizing with Kanade when these things happen, you never end up laughing at what happens to him, you just get royally pissed off about it and it gets even worse because no one else in the show seems to give a shit about him.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the other problem comes in, just about every character in this show is an unlikable douchebag. In the first few episodes, the characters were not too bad and showed some likability. Unfortunately the episode turned them all into complete assholes with little redeeming quality. Let us go down this list of these characters. First I will start with Chocolat, the girl that is sent to help Kanade. At first she was a nice and loyal character who was likable, and cute. The later episodes ruined this by making her a complete ditz and giving her this obsession with wanting to see Kanade having sex with another man. I am not exaggerating, she keeps spouting out those things all the time and it ruins her character. FIrst of all it makes no sense seeing as how she is from another world and is not human, and it is even touched upon earlier that she doesn\u2019t feel the typical type of attraction. Secondly, just think about this type of action if the gender roles were reversed. There is no way in hell a series would ever get away with it if that was the case.\\n\\n\r\nOn that subject, there are a lot of things that this series does that go way beyond what is acceptable. For example, there are several times where Kanade is raped yet the series attempts to downplay it as if it isn\u2019t a big deal. There is a much older woman who seems to have a crush on him and tried to have her way with him by chasing him down, because if there is one subject that is absolutely hilarious, it is statutory rape. ANd that is not even the only instance of it. I will just clarify one thing though, it is not because it uses rape as an attempt at comedy that is a problem, but the reason why is that it is presented as if it is something completely normal and is brushed under the rug. Normally when a series invokes a darker subject matter, it tries to overplay it in an attempt to cross the line twice (IE something like Family Guy or South Park). However in this series, it does not even have any sense of awareness of what it is talking about. NouCome cannot even do shock humor correctly.\\n\\n\r\nNow back on the subject of characters, there are Kanade\u2019s \u201cfriends.\u201d I say friends in quotes because I can barely consider them to be his friends with the way they treat him. Like with most characters, they were likable at first but quickly ended up getting worse. Oka admittedly wasn\u2019t too bad with the exception of her laughing when Kanade shoots onion extract up his nose and is on the ground writhing in pain, but Furano was just horrible. Early on she seemed like a typical Kuudere with a quirky and odd sense of humor, but she quickly ends up becoming much worse when we find out that she already loves Kanade but cannot spit anything out, so she treats him like crap and going to the extent to inflict physical harm and repeatedly beat him. None of this makes any sense in the least and it makes her character absolutely abhorrent. Not to mention it leaves a horrible message, :if someone physically abuses you,chances are they actually love you and don\u2019t want you to leave.\\n\\n\r\nUtage is someone who is helping out Kanade because she has had to put up with the Absolute Choice as well. She is also a 29 year old loli. I am not joking, and there is no explanation given either. She comes across as very cold and non-caring, as if she does not even care about Kanade to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nKonagi is probably the most detestable character in the show. Sh is basically the typical overly shy moe girl who would not be so bad, except for the fact that she has a group of fanboys on multiple occasions have kidnaped Kanade, beat him half to death (and one of them has even raped him on multiple occasions, which the show just tries to brush under the rug), and she does nothing to stop them. It is implied that they have also done this to other people that have gotten close to her. She says that she cares for Kanade as a person yet apparently not enough to tell her fanboys to fuck off. Also they are complete hypocrites in that they beat up Kanade for supposedly trying to hit on her despite them sending her a garter belt.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nUltimately this is the problem with NouCome, everyone is an asshole. Not even just the characters themselves, but the universe it takes place in is utterly horrendous. Even without absolute choice, no one ever decides to do anything when Kanade is put through constant harm because of others. Honestly this series has given me the impression that even Takeru Kasukabe must have some type of personal grudge against him. The viewer not caring what happens to the characters of a series is a sign of bad writing, but the writer caring less than his audience is a sign of even worse writing. This series was just painful and unpleasant to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a shame this was the case because the first few episodes actually showed some amount of promise in the first 2 episodes, but it quickly falls off a cliff. Also there were some moments that were legitimately funny. Ultimately, it is because of the promise it showed that this show was painful to watch. I kept hoping something would change, and every time I thought it was getting better, it did something to screw itself up. To be honest, if there is a second season, I would still be tempted to watch it just to see if things finally get better for Kanade, but seeing as how Takeru Kasukabe seems to have some type of beef with him, i\u2019m not getting my hopes up.",

This was partly done by the amazing unique characters and the cliched mixing into one leading to some great comedic moments. Alone the characters could of made me laugh but this anime combined  some of the weirdest and wackiest characters I've ever seen, not to mention the protoganists curse which adds more random to the mix making the show completely unpredictable. \r\nUnfortunately the anime has its flaws its biggest one for me was the ending, in this case lack there of. The anime seems to end right when things aregetting good, and many things are left unresolved and unanswered. Which is disappointing because even though the plot it self wasn't anything special the mix of characters and the protoganists unique curse made this mundane plot into something great and as I was watching each episode my expectations kept growing but ultimately they were not met.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is great for anyone just looking for a something to laugh at and relax it has and interesting plot and a great set of characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall rating is 7/10 I would love to give this anime a higher rating as the characters and enjoyment are at least 9/10 if not 10/10, however the lack of an ending and the amount of unanswered questions just made the anime feel incomplete. \\n",

            "content": "\u201cMy Mental Choices Are Completely Interfering with my School Romantic Comedy\u201d Aka, \u201cNoucome,\u201d (which is probably what I\u2019m going to call it from now on in the review), was an anime that really surprised me in both enjoyment and quality. After reading the summary, I was expecting a nonsensical, random, shoujo with girls with huge boobs and large eyes eating pieces of toast with jam and looking as adorable as possible. And while this was indeed true, I had fun with it otherwise and its insane plot is surprisingly well-developed.\r\nStory: 9\r\nI found myself shaking my head after first reading the summary. \u201cThis is just anothershoujo,\u201d I thought. \u201cIt won\u2019t be any different from the others,\u201d I thought; but then I realized how fun the plot actually sounded and tried at the first episode. Basically, in a nutshell, the story revolves around a young, handsome, high school boy Kanade Amakusa, who everyone has pushed aside as one of the \u201cReject Five\u201d even though he used to be quite popular. This is only because of a disability, if you will, he gained last year that caused multiple choice questions to appear in his head to solve real life conflicts. Many of these solutions are usually perverted and weird. One thing led to another and he became unpopular, finally. This is a harem genre anime in which Kanade is surrounded by the other girls in the Reject Five. It\u2019s basically a growing love story with hilarious elements mixed in between. I love how the anime knew that the plot seemed very \u201carchetypical\u201d and decided to play around with it a little. A humorous mood is always surrounding the air of this anime. I was really disappointed though, at the fact that was only 10 episodes long. I believe it would\u2019ve been a lot less compacted and would\u2019ve been much more humorous if the anime extended a few episodes more. Haha, or maybe that\u2019s just me not wanting it to end. I guess the element that did the most for this anime was the irony. I mean, a conflict would erupt and instead of finding the most serious and calming solution as possible, Kanade takes the hard, humorous route and entertains us with his constant failure. I could not stop laughing at his constant catastrophes and screw-ups, because then we get to see more Kanade tries to start all over again. Overall, the plot was very well developed and there seemed to be very little holes and confusion. 9\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fricking adorable. I mean, I know I don\u2019t normally don\u2019t like that kind of thing and I don\u2019t really approve of the flashing titties and skirts\u2026 but I couldn\u2019t help  but I couldn\u2019t help it. The art style and design, with the bright colors, large eyes, cute patterns\u2026 It just fit the anime really well and there\u2019s no denying that fact. It really had a well impact on the whole entire humorous and fun aspect of the anime. It wasn\u2019t too serious, and it was pretty cute. Kanade was the only character that I believe could\u2019ve been designed better. I mean, he was supposed to be \u201chandsome.\u201d That was his image, and that\u2019s who he used to be; but I just didn\u2019t see it. Also, I wouldn\u2019t say the movement of the anime is very pretty; the only thing that got me was the color. Still very well executed. 7\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nOkay, nothing was very special about the OST soundtrack. That was a big flaw in the anime. I would expect a cute, bubbly, song that cheers everyone up and is almost nonsensical to the plot, but I didn\u2019t get anything like that, so I was pretty disappointed. The opening was pretty cute though, I mean, you have all of these adorable little girls, why not use them for a well-choreographed dance number? Normally I don\u2019t like that kind of thing, but once again, it fit the anime really well. Now, for the voice acting. Okay, you can tell that the actors had LOADS of fun filming this anime, especially the actor for Kanade. He had so many different moods and tones in his voice that just cracked me up, so Kudos to him for keeping a straight face through it all. The acting was really well done for all the girls.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nAh, my favorite thing to analyze. I won\u2019t analyze all of the characters because there are just too damn many. That\u2019s a weakness point or two to take away from the anime\u2019s characters. Sorry, but too many characters is a reoccurring issue in anime these days and I many are added just for a small something that plays insignificant to the story and that mainly ends up screwing with the story a bit. And you\u2019d think, in that entire sea if characters, that I would hate a few, but I really didn\u2019t. The variety of the characters\u2019 personalities and different viewpoints and sources of humor ADDED to the anime and just added more laughs. I mean, yeah, some characters were insignificant, like that one \u201clittle sister character\u201d but I couldn\u2019t help but enjoy the variety. I had to see it coming though, I mean, it IS a harem, duh, Stupid Hattie. And seriously, I even laughed at the side characters that seemed to play no value to the story, such as the \u201cFlippant God,\u201d (OMG he was hilarious) or his ugly neighbor who is a \u201cboy lolicon.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis anime was fricking hilarious. The randomness along with the amazing elements and characters really got me hooked. It would always cheer me up and I have never loved a shoujo anime like this. I hope they make more of this anime so I can get a less ambiguous ending and a refreshing second season. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/9\\n",

            "content": "This show is madness. As long as you have a crass sense of humour and are an anime-viewer of dubious self-respect, you should probably go ahead and check this out. The jokes are generally less tame and hit-or-miss than those you find in other anime, and the writers did a great job at injecting satire of a bunch of anime tropes into the show. The result is a delightful cocktail of preposterous ecchi humour, caricatural harem dynamics and dirty slapstick gags that would make a serious audience retch.\r\nThere are bad episodes, and these tend to be where they shift from inane humour to basic high-schoolsoapy stuff and don't make enough use of the clearly considerable creative wit they possess. Still, those are only few compared to the mainstream of ****s and giggles, and you can tell exceedingly clearly what you're going to be getting with this show from the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nI admit, despite never intending to watch this each morning for anything other than a bit of comedy, Yukihira grew on me - her cute design aside, her main voice-actor, bizarre deadpan humour and schizophrenic awkwardness gave her a good dose of charm. Aside from that I was pretty meh about the other characters and plotlines for anything other than lulz, which \u2013 to be fair - they provided amply.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, unless you have a stick up your butt, do yourself a favour and give it the twenty minute test. It's very, very fun.",

            "content": "I'll be referring to this series as Noukume to save me the trouble of typing its title.\r\nRomantic comedy harem series are a dime a dozen these days. Once in a blue moon, a series pops up from this crowded genre and separates it self from its brethren. Noukome belongs to the chosen few that brings something truly enjoyable to the table despite its generic cast and shows how execution can make a difference.\r\nWe are introduced to Amakusa Kanade. A healthy fine looking young lad that is living a normal high school life or so we were led to believe. Kanade actually has a condition calledAbsolute Choice where he has to choose from usually outrageous options given to him by a voice inside his head and unless he chooses one he will be tormented by a severe headache. This condition continued to ruin his life until one day he was given the chance to rid himself of Absolute Choice by god himself. He has to complete insane missions given to him or else he will be haunted with Absolute Choice for the rest of his life.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters is truly a strong point of Noukome in spite of having almost or if not all your run of the mill harem character archetypes. The real magic in these characters is how well they entertain you with their crazy antics and maximize the use of their archetypes by playing with their strengths. Their dialogues and interactions are genuinely hilarious which at times deliberately attacks some of animes oldest cliche such as the infamous censor.\\n\\n\r\nFor the art and animation all I can say is that there's nothing noteworthy about them. They're pretty average at best. The character design reeks and screams mediocre. Not saying that it isn't attractive or anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound chosen for the series really suits the mood and sets the right atmosphere for it. The opening theme S.M.L is an energetic warm up to start the show while the ending theme Taiyou to Tsuki no Cross gives off this feeling of \"mission accomplished\" which ends the show in a good note. The voice actors did a good job in playing their characters most notably Kondou Yui(as Furano) and Ohzora Naomi(as Yuragi). It was enjoyable to see how well they play with their characters by adapting multiple personas especially Naomi.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem with this series is that it's way too short even compared to other seasonal anime who usually have 12-13 episodes. It leaves the viewers wanting for more which in a way isn't a bad thing for opening a path for a second season. To sum it up, Noukume is a fun anime to watch that leaves its audience in a state of ecstasy in its wake.",

            "content": "Try to keep an open mind. At first glance this is not my sort of thing, but that's because of the character designs. Looking at the picture while writing this I see another school comedy with a harem theme, not really my thing. But this is not really a kids anime, this has too much raunchy humor to pass for kids. And that's why I loved it! Sure there's some offensive material, and it may require trigger warnings for some. But as an adult I liked it. It's not like it was genuinely Kanade Amakusa's fault. Ultimate choice serves as a stupendous plot device andsource of comedy; it's just too funny not to want to keep watching. The only thing is the character design, but once I got past that I was along for the ride. All the characters are adorable and it never loses it's humor or charm.\\n\r\nThe real star of this show though is Furano Yukihira the girl who sits behind Kanade in class. She has a weird sense of humor and will often tell jokes with a blank expression. She seems to have feelings for Kanade, but exhibits a tsundere attitude towards him. She's so conflicted and real that it almost breaks your heart. Yuragi Hakoniwa is cliche but funny in her own unique way. The only character I wasn't feeling was Utage D\u014draku, Amakusa's homeroom teacher and someone who was afflicted with the \"Absolute Choices\" curse in the past. I didn't like her because she has the appearance of an elementary school girl, despite being 29 and felt the show could have used one real woman reference.\\n\r\nOther than that it excels at what it offers.",

Or maybe some thing serious like vanilla? \\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of hot baes, But most importantly.. can you get to the center of the tootsie pop? I say yes. And if you don't get what I'm getting at there's a moderate amount of character/love progression. You definitely will find it pushing along the main character and the heroines of the story. Though half of the time it sorta gets shut down..\\n\\n",

There isn't much more to say about the story, It's simply a great idea. The character development is pretty much what the series is about, Kanade and his companions and how their relationship to eachother changes as the series progress. Since theres this \"touch\" of Ecchi (theres actualy quite a bit) It also adds up to the overall enjoyment of the show.\r\nI strongly recommend you to watch this series, it's just great.

            "content": "To begin with, this is definitely the best anime I have ever watched ( under the genre of romance / comedy anyway) .  \r\nFor starters, this is unlike most anime plot and it does its own thing rather than being a bit of everything.  This is the main reason why I love it.  Unlike other anime such as Boku wa Tomodachi ga sukunai ( Haganai ), where a sense of reality is present with a hint of fiction is involved, Noucome (Ore no nounai sentakushi ..... ) isn't like that.\r\nIn Noucome, one cannot simply relate to its situations directly to the viewer'slife.  For example, in reality, one would certainly pick up a H (perv) magazine and either eat it or smell it.  These are not something that a normal person would do in real life.  This is a major factor that I love it.\\n\r\nIn addition, in most anime (that I've watched), the producers would make the show relate-able to the audience.  The producers of this ignores this completely and do their own thing.  Hence the wacky-ness of the choices in this show.\\n\\n\r\nAs I have mentioned in the last sentence, choices.  Yes, unlike other shows, the protagonist as well as the audience faces these choices, making this feeling like a galge ( dating sim game, targeted towards male) or a graphic novel. I'm not a big fan of these games myself but I admire how they link this towards this show, creating an effect which tries to engage itself with the audience.  \\n\\n\r\nUnlike most of the other shows I have watched, the drawing technique is in a league of its own in my opinion.  Unlike Yuushibu or Wake up, Girls! , they make the characters so kawaii, including the main character itself.  The way how each character blushes to their pouting faces to their crying face, it's almost like a puppy.  You just want to grab it and console it.  \\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is very unusual.  It is simply impossible to predict what could happen next because of the mental choices.  So the story is like a roller coaster ride.  You don't know what it is like unless you sit down and experience every single moment of it.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, if you're like me.  I enjoy crazy plot twists, impossible stunts, situations in reality that will never come up, complicated love and a good laugh, this is truly the perfect anime for you.\\n\r\n(slight spolier)\\n\r\nAlso, there are clips at the end of each episode telling you what would happen if the main character chose a different decision.",

The first thing you should know is that this anime serie was not made to have an intense storyline with extreme drama etc.... it was made for those who enjoy the lighter series where everything that normally would be serious is taken as a joke. What makes ore no nounai so successful is how well they pull it off. Think about it he has a terrible curse on him that will obviously cause him a lot of misery howeverbecause of that very same curse he gets more and more involved with the characters around him making obvious room for a harem.You probably think so typical but his harem is necessary in the storyline as it reveals Kanade`s kind nature and leads us along the little bit of seriousness that is present. In other words its keeps the serie moving without making itself the story. \\n\\n\r\nArt :\\n\r\nthe overall Art in noucome is amazing as to be expected from the new series coming out recently. The detail for the character and their surroundings are awsome and i think plenty of effort has been put into them. The colours are beautifully bright not to mention i love the artwork for the eyes and chocolates super cute outfit!!! (ahem) i think plenty of work was put into to it and it is quite wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nI really like the opening song for noucome i think it is open and playful and perfect for the serie it is representing and the right music was used to create the right moods.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter:\\n\r\nWhat i really like about noucome is that altough on the outside they all seemed like the typical dere`s they all had a twist that most characters dont have not to mention their constant need to go WAY over the top compared to your regular dere`s wich obviously was done purposely.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIf you consider that i spend alot of the serie with tears in my eyes from laughter i cant deny anything. I really enjoyed the serie it was a nice break from my usual serious storyline anime series. The overall humour was great and it was something different to me i loved it.",

The set up for this show is fine, but the way it's handled isn't.\r\nStory - 5:\r\nThe concept of forcing the main character to pick between some options can create some hilarious situations, this show was at it's best when it was trying to make the viewer laugh with some over the top situation caused by absolute choice. The problem is that this wasn't always the focus.\r\nWhen the show focuses on the characters and building up Kanade's harem it feels generic and boring. Thisis mostly due to the characters not being all that interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot allows for some ridiculous scenarios, but it rarely uses this to its full potential. More often than not the choice is merely a distraction, which is only good when it adds to the comedy of the situation.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 5:\\n\r\nGeneric anime art, nothing special, it's not good or bad. The way the absolute choice is presented is done well though.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6:\\n\r\nThe OST is good, and the sound effects are decent as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 2:\\n\r\nThis is where Noucome really fell flat for me. The main character is the generic indecisive harem anime protagonist and his only redeeming quality is the empathy you can feel for him and the way he handles some of the situations he's in. He also says he'll never chose something that could hurt the feeling of another person, which generally means he makes a bad decision because he's being \"considerate\".\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast are boring, generic, or lack any sort of depth. Any somewhat interesting character is glazed over in place of the main cast. Throughout the anime they refer to a group of people as the \"reject five\" but as you find out later in the anime, there aren't even five of them, which makes no sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe only character that is likeable and gets at least some screen time is the teacher. She really should  have been a bigger part of the anime than she was.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5:\\n\r\nThere were times this anime made me laugh, but they weren't enough to distract me from dreadfully boring characters.",

You can see this from the get-go but, I choose to endure thinking it would redeem itself. While it does get better it is only a little and it is in the last 3 episodes.\r\nThe story itself is summed up in the phrase \"dating game\" where you have to make a choice otherwise you won't be able to proceed with the story. The issue here is that the choices are so absurd that they're trying too hard to be funny. Eventually the choices begin to make moresense or have more of a 'realistic' choice to them but, it was so late in the game that it didn't really save the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was standard for its time and still holds up till today. You can see some short cuts they take but, otherwise it won't hurt your eyes to look at.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is a bit lacking as you will hear repeating effects and of course \"CHOOSE\" so many times that it just gets to be annoying.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the story the characters suffer- you have the classic troupes of Crazy, Lovable Idiot, Can't Speak her Mind, and Onee-chan. The development of these characters were almost non-existent, at one point they were developing the character of one of the main leads but, it eventually got dropped for a sad attempt of humor. At the end the characters are where they started without any difference except for 'its now a harem'.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in this show is pretty dry leaving me wanting the entire time. The best of it comes from the side characters of a girl who acts as her 'royal guard'. Every time they were on the screen I was laughing. Otherwise it was pretty droll and I was just waiting for something to happen.",

It is a light novel based on Takeru Kasukabe anime and anime premiered in 2013.\r\nSTORY: The anime tells the story of Kanade Amakusa. Kanade is a somewhat special teenager, as this gifted with a curse, \"the curse of absolute elections.\" This curse forces him to have to opt for a series of not very nice choices for him or for them in public. You would think that would not have to choose, but it is inevitable, because if you do not choose at a certain time, the headbegins to ache. These decisions undoubtedly spoil the way that people see him in carrying out any of these elections ...\\n\\n\r\nWhen he think you he have to continue the rest of his life, a girl, apparently sent by God himself, to help him overcome a series of tests that allow he to get rid of lifetime that curse appears that forced to choose inopportune situations.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of their nefarious actions accordingly election, will become one of the five rejected from the school, damaging his reputation within the school, but benefiting, when meeting new friends who will accompany you throughout the anime and its lifetime.\\n\\n\r\nThe tests that allow he to get rid of the curse will not be entirely easy, surely making God pass good times laughing at situations that commands him to do, provided that if at any time fail one of the tests, will to stay with the curse of life.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nKanade: Kanade is the main character of the series who is suffering from \"Absolute Choices\", a curse that forces him to choose one of two or more options. If he doesn't choose, he develops an unbearable migraine. In the beginning, he meets Chocolat and learns that to end the curse, he has to complete a series of \"missions\". Failing to finish any mission before its deadline will result in the curse staying forever. As the result of \"Absolute Choices\", his classmates view him as a weird person and thus he has become one of the \"Reject Five\".\\n\\n\r\nChocolat: The beautiful girl who falls from the sky after Amakusa chooses the option \"a beautiful girl falls from the sky\" when given an Absolute Choice on his way home from school one day. She chooses the name \"Chocolat\" when Kanade gives her a box of chocolates to eat. She was sent from the God World to help Kanade complete the \"missions\" in order to remove the curse. However, she is quite air-headed, making her ineffective when assisting Kanade. According to her, she lost her memory prior to receiving the mission, including how to resolve the curse. In the second novel, she transfers into Kanade's class as his \"pet\".\\n\r\nSometimes, when she bumps her head or gets drunk, an inner Chocolat, who has not lost her memories, appears for a short time. Unlike her counterpart, this Chocolat is smart, helpful, and has a better idea about the curse. She reverts to her usual self if she bumps her head again or becomes sober. According to her, Chocolat will return to the god world once the curse has ended. At one point, after regaining her memory, she tries to seduce Kanade, but fails because of a chocolate box hitting her head, returning her to normal.\\n\\n\r\nART: The anime does not have many effects. It is an anime that develops life at school and therefore not needed many special effects. They could have been better drawn characters and landscapes, as it becomes an anime that teaches you the landscapes of urban Japan, and very poorly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The anime is fun, and it's a comedy that makes you laugh at the various decisions that Kanade has to overcome. If it is true that could be better and have an argument that makes you hook up a little more.",

It teaches you about the decisions and choices you make in your life. Watch it if you have time or if you're bored.",

            "content": "Choices, life is full of choices, no matter what direction you turn or person you encounter in the end, as history has shown, you will have to make a choice.\r\nWhat I have written above is the premise for the show, and unbelievably, even though this show is full of ecchi and comedy, it sticks by it really well. How each episode is formulated is with the main character going throughout his day having to face a curse which instructs him to randomly choose between doing 2 or 3 things that are related to the on going situation he is in. They also throw in atwist fairly soon and allow the main character to get rid of his curse if he completes several horrendous missions. These two main plot points, as well as the fact that his mental choices have resulted in him being in the group with the five most infamous students, makes for a really comedic show, with ample time to crack jokes, have comedy and humor while still following the overall story. The great thing about this show is that its atmosphere isn't meant to be taken too seriously but still draws a fine line of \"crazy\" where it's due. \\n\\n\r\nAn important note for the following information is that my rating is based on the basis of good subbed version, or rather one with very simple text and only complex when needed.  I have found the quality of humor in this show drop drastically if watched with bad subs, as it makes jokes harder to follow and if the text is too complex, you will be trying to figure out what the character means instead of the context. \\n\\n\r\nHere are the overall scores I gave this show:\\n\\n\r\nStory 8\\n\r\nThe story itself I believe is genius, they figured out how to include all the cliches and typical troupes into an anime in which it actually works, unlike others. If you want more of a serious show I would avoid this because the questions the curse asks are, by my definition, stupid. However the series plays with that and results into some funny situations. In addition, the fact that his friends aren't the typical types of characters but rather multiple troupes mashed into one allows progress in the story much more easier and makes watching less stressful than if everyone were high-strung and obnoxious. \\n\r\nSadly, at the end, there was a bit of a rush and what could have been completely cleared up became another day's issue. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7\\n\r\nNow this is what I was the most torn about, the art was what is was, nothing particularly good, but it was cute and had the emotions of the characters expressed to a good extent. The animation was typical of a high school show, and as any show had a good episode where the animation was that of a movie. I like to include the category of animation into art as well so my rating is a mix of both.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8\\n\r\nThe characters were very good with what they did, I usually don't rate animes in regards to their sound because unlike other things, if you pay attention to sound you can be heavily influenced as it's much more of a preference rather than something absolute. With that being said, the character's emotions were definitely expressed well with the voices given. The opening and endings were nice songs as well, nothing too horrendous, but even so, I'm not going to remove marks from a show because of the music, I only add marks when it's particularly good and/or unique; of course I will have to remove them if it ruins the entire mood of the show but that has yet to happen since anime studios are good with soundtracks and openings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8\\n\r\nBesides being the leader of a typical tasteless harem, the main character makes it clear as to whom he doesn't like as each girl is added, so even though I will definitely agree that this show is a harem, it doesn't take away from the show. Each girl in the cast \"likes\" the main character simply due to the progression of the story and the fact that he is actually, yes believe it or not, hot. The main character is a very attractive dude in the eyes of both the male and females at his school but can't get a girlfriend or get remotely close because of his curse that causes him to act randomly and weird. \\n\\n\r\nEach character in this show has their own surprises except one or two. The actions the main character makes aren't like other harems, while other shows will have a dense and/or nervous reck playing the lead, in this show, while he does have intense feelings towards females, knows what he wants and doesn't get punched or slapped when he goes into awkward situations. While the whole cast things he's perverted, he in actuality is quite normal and acts like the typical guy. Even in scenarios where the sexual tension becomes high, we aren't questioning as to what this guy is going to do but rather what the girl will do, which is a nice change.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9\\n\r\nThis show had me laughing every single episode, for more than half the episode. So when you think about it, every single joke would get me laughing and every moment where there were no jokes I could still have been laughing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8.4\\n\r\nThis show was a blast to watch, as to why I gave it an 8.4 would be things for the bad ending and that there were some things I wished that could happen that didn't happen. But in the end, this show, I wouldn't say that it is a show you watch when you are bored, but a show where you want to have fun. It's not mild enough for casual watching as you won't have the will to follow the jokes, but if you are looking for something that is fun I would certainly check this anime out.\\n\\n",

Many people will think that its just a fan-service bit but I feel like its much more. The story is about a guy who has to make decisions or he feels pain and suffering. Right away I was intrigued and this feeling did not let me down. Its a story about the main character basically given queststo do to get rid of his absolute choice curse. I honestly started rooting for the guy to get rid of this and he has some funny experiences along the way to get rid of this curse. While left unfinished I was really excited the entire time.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is great. I like everything about the art-style.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe music is good and I for one download (almost) all anime songs. The cool thing about the OP and ED for this show is they are distinguishable. I have around 500 Japanese songs and when Nocoume starts playing its OP/ ED I know.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nI love these characters. Chocolat is fun, Tsundere-chan is perfect and loveable, everyone's-onee-san is great and overall the entire cast works great in this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI laughed a lot in this show and each episode had me craving the next. Lots of anime are listed as comedies and many have just a couple of funny moments but this one had multiple and some really good moments at that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I loved this anime its my favorite anime and I would recommend this to you for some decent-story-ecchi all around good fun.",

            "content": "Well, that was a waste of a premise that didn't suck per se.  Alas the execution was quite bad. Unless, of course, you're perfectly satisfied with tired slapstick humour, boobies, panties, boobies, and more boobies.  I'm not.\r\nSo, the premise is that our hero is suddenly subjected to attention by a quite flippant god, whose grand idea is to inflict a curse on him.  Said curse consists of him being presented with a choice between two (or more) bad options, and always at a time when either choice will embarrass him.  In order to try and get rid of the curse, hehas to fulfill equally embarrassing \"missions\".  Forget backstory, why this is happening, why it's happening to Amakusa in specific -- we get none of that.  This has overall the feel of immature gods using humans for entertainment.   You can see the perfect setup for a comedy, can't you.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I can see how this could be good even without any backstory.  In the hands of a better writer, this could be comedy gold. I enjoyed the role of the flippant god, very aptly voiced by Tachibana Shinnosuke.\\n\\n\r\nAlas I didn't enjoy much else.  It's basically a harem show bordering on ecchi with not enough redeeming features for those who don't inherently love that sort of feeble sexual teasing.\\n\\n\r\nStory:  silly but potentially fun premise, lousy follow-through.  There was no progression, no pacing, no growth (yes, even a comedy should have some of that or it won't touch me at all), no sense (who all is in on the curse?), and no conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  quite pleasant; bright and clean with decent animation.  Character design makes all the main characters easy to distinguish.  Cute girls, but not too cute.  Too much blush; sheesh.\\n\\n\r\nSound: a couple of good voice acting performances, the usual professionalism from the rest, too many squeaky female voices (personal peeve), peppy OP (by some random female idol group) and ED, inoffensive BGM.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  Amasuka is your basic bland insert-yourself-here character.  He's not as annoying as some of those are, he's not as pervy as many of them, and he actually has a sense of personal ethics, so he's a step up from the basic model, but why anyone would want to declare their love for him is beyond me.  Yeah, yeah, otaku wishfulfillment, I get it.  The girls are mostly stock:  kuudere, childhood friend secretly in love, wannabe imouto, classy and mysterious student council president, haughty, sadistic ojousama, magical girlfriend who falls from the sky and acts like a puppy (ok, so that last bit is not stock) -- Chocolat is actually a character I like just because she's different, though I hated it when they had her do a turn as the perfect waifu.  There's no character development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  I am astounded I made it through all 10 episodes.  Now, they were at the end of my day, and I was mostly vegetating already; that might explain it.  It's not so horrible a show that I'd throw the box against the wall if I had bought it; it has small moments that even I found funny (I enjoyed the short bits after the ED where for some episode we got shown a possible outcome had Amakusa chosen differently, and as already mentioned I rather liked the flippant  god).  But I can't say I actually enjoyed myself, no.  The fan service was so pervasive that the show needed some intellectual stimulation for me to make up for that, and it didn't bring that.",

            "content": "Imagine the \"would you rather\" game. Now imagine you were playing that game nonstop 24/7. That is what the main guy is faced with. A voice tells him to pick an answer from these horrible embarrassing choices and he has to chose one otherwise he gets bad headaches. That is what makes this anime so funny. He's always doing embarrassing crazy things because of these choices. This anime incorporates many types of humor all into one show. There's puns, sex jokes, gay jokes, and just everything really. He has his harem of girls that are all odd but cute and funny. There's a lot ofpanty shots and funny ecchi scenes. I was laughing from episode one till the last one. The comedy in this show is just too good. Lets go over the main cast. First we have Amakusa Kanade the main guy. He's caring, always making retorts to the other cast when they aren't making any sense or being weird(all the time) and just like a lot of harem men he is dense to all the girls feelings. Then there's Chocolat. She is a busty airhead who loves to eat food and sweets and is pretty much a freeloader. Then we have Yukihira Furano. She has a harsh cold attitude around people but she's actually a sensitive fragile girl. She's always making weird jokes and is very tsundere. Lastly we have Yuuouji Ouka. She is an energetic loving girl that seems like nothing fazes her but she has a pure maiden type mindset at times. The interaction among the cast is just too funny and Kanade's retorts around a crazy weird cast are just as funny. Give this anime a watch.",

            "content": "It's worth noting that I watched the first four episodes of Noukome a couple of months earlier than I watched the rest.\r\nHonestly, I really wanted to like it. The premise is good, a highschool student is randomly forced to choose between often ridiculous and embarrassing choices. If he doesn't, he experiences extreme physical pain. To lift this \"curse\", he must complete a series of near impossible, and ludicrous missions. It's a good set-up. So I guess I should explain why I didn't like this anime.\r\nThe first reason is probably \"Chocolat\", the support character meant to be helping the Protagonist. To put it bluntly, she's completelyfan-service. She can pull cute faces, do what should be cute things, but it's non-stop with her, and it makes her character boring. She could be redeemable if she wasn't an airhead all of the time, but honestly, if she wasn't a character I don't think it would have changed much. There's an episode where she's not like this, and honestly it's a good episode. She's a lot of fun to watch when she's serious, and it makes her cute scenes all the better when they happen. \\n\r\nThe second reason is the protagonist himself. At the beginning of the anime he's introduced as a normal guy plagued by the curse which ends up making everyone think he's a weirdo. Because of the curse he's labelled one of the \"reject 5\", the 5 lowest people on the popularity list. It is set up that everything strange about him is a series of coincidence, misunderstanding and of course, the curse. By the end of the anime he ends up actually just being a weirdo. It tries to touch back to misunderstanding in some scenes, but it doesn't really work. It bugs me that he wasn't overly consistent.\\n\r\nPersonality seems to be an on-going problem, especially with the other supporting characters. Yuouji, Seira and most of the other characters seem to be more of a list of stereotypes and defining traits rather than characters. There's a lot of explaining or showing a dominant trait for each of them, but not a lot of development or interests/likes/dislikes explained. It's difficult to become invested in them. The exception to this is Yukihira, who receives a lot of development over the course of the series. \\n\r\nThe comedy isn't bad either, I can see it's funny, but I'm struggling to laugh at it. I get in a good chuckle here and there, but something about the choices make it seem really forced at times. Maybe that's apart of the joke? I'm not sure, but if you've seen the first episode, you've already seen the highlight of the series. The art style is different too, not bad, but again, something about it just doesn't sit too well with me.\\n\r\nIt's not a bad anime by any means. It's just not particularly good either. If you have some time and you're interested in where it might take you, give it a watch. But if you're really after something that will keep you invested, maybe something else.",

            "content": "So Sentakushi is another High School romcom with way too much fanservice to be taken even remotely seriously. I was all-in-all very disappointed with this anime, because the premise seemed interesting, a boy with a \u201cAbsolute Multiple Choice\u201d, meaning that on occasion he\u2019ll see 2+ choices, and he has do do/pick one of the choices, or he\u2019ll get an increasingly painful headache very quickly. The catch, is that these choices are often completely ridiculous to the point of sheer stupidity.\r\nOur story picks up with a really cool scene all about how choices shaped the world that we live in today. Soon after this ends, wemeet our protagonist, Kanade Amakusa. Kanade has recently developed his Absolute Choice curse for little-to-no explained reason, and as a result, his reputation has quickly taken a nose dive due to his otherwise unexplained bouts of randomness and creepiness (IE, streaking, acting like a pig, sexual molestation/touching) One day, Kanade is walking home from school when suddenly his AMC starts acting up, and due to his choice, \u201cA beautiful young girl falls from the sky\u201d. This girl has amnesia, and all she knows is that she is from heaven. It is soon revealed that the girl loves food, and when she attempts to eat Kande\u2019s expensive chocolates, she asks, \u201cDo you love chocolates?\u201d resulting in her choosing her name as Chocolat. After choosing between death, and letting Choclat stay (which, of course, he chose the latter), our hero soon receives a phone call from God! After proving that he really is God through a series of funny means, he informs Kande that there is a way to remove his AMC curse. As it turns out, the only way to remove the curse is by successfully completing a series of \u201ctrials\u201d with the help of Chocolat. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this series were interesting enough, albeit copy/paste of other popular characters and archetypes; but the problem lies in the complete lack of character development, even when it would have been incredibly easy and more satisfying. There are many important secondary in this anime, and as a result, I\u2019ll only be covering four of the members of the Reject 5 (the least popular kids on campus). Furano Yukihara is a strange combination of Tsundere and Kuudere, though I can\u2019t really complain about this\u2026 odd mixture due to her pulling it off quite well. My problem with Yukihara is that she had so much behind the scenes character development, yet she is never fully utilized. Regardless, she (in my opinion) has way too much Tsun and virtually no Dere. The last major character that I\u2019ll talk about is Yuoji Oka, a Deredere character that is mostly immune to Kanade\u2019s strangeness (and sexual advances, to an extent) due to her own out-there and crazy personality.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, nothing really stuck out musically, including the opening or closing credits. The opening video, however, was at least interesting and complemented the show in just the perfect atmosphere and humor.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d love to rant about the ending and the waaaaaaay underused character, but I\u2019m trying to keep these spoiler-free.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I, as I said earlier, am very disappointed in this show\u2019s lack fulfilling of potential. It had a very interesting premise, and if it had been handled with a bit more maturity, Sentakushi could have been a diamond in the rough of romcoms. I\u2019m going to have to give this a 6/10 just because it had enough plot and questions to keep me coming back. \\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoyed this review, please check out my anime review blog at trips-anime-review.tumblr.com/",

That toy is the silly humor that the main character gets into due to that \"Absolute Choice\". Its the only redeeming feature in this bland burger, but it is a pretty strong redeeming factor. Aside from that, we have standard nice guy protagonist #1598 and female characters who are a set of different anime girl tropes with not much underneath except pantsu. In the end, its funny but forgettable.\r\nHarem Development Index: 3/10 From start to end, the harem justseems like a default setting with no reasoning behind it and zero progress with any of the girls by the end.",

            "content": "Many of you reading will be quite familiar with anime, but for those who aren't, welcome to a new type of media with its own unique conventions. Ore no bla bla bla is a reasonably good anime, and has a little bit of everything, but falls short in so many ways.\r\nWhile the philosophical intro was quite a refreshing way to start a comedy, it spent far too long developing a really superficial thesis. That said, those with background in history, particularly Japanese history, are treated to many jokes about famous people and their choices. This kind of humour is an absolute pleasure in small, unexpecteddoses, but the intro was quite hamfisted.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the anime, there were many moments that gave the writers opportunity to explore characters and the choice plot device in more depth, but I constantly found myself disappointed by their refusal to explore. The few good plot twists in the series were heavily telegraphed up to 3 or 4 episodes early, and the choice mechanic rarely served a purpose other than comic relief. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fairly well-developed, but none of them had a significant character arc. By episode 10, even the protagonist was basically the same character we met in the first episode. While most of the plot was lackluster and dull, the charm of this anime comes from how outrageous some of the situations are. There was also quite a lot of fanservice and fetish fuel in the anime, though I'm quite neutral towards both. \\n\\n\r\nNouCome is not bad. The problem is that it isn't really that great either. The art and characters are solid. The storyline and comedy fall flat quite often. It's hard to favour this one when there are so many excellent anime in the comedy genre already.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy it much, but the anime has moe appeal for those who love cute and vulnerable characters.",

            "content": "It's simply, basically, eminently, a funny and absurd comedy school life of a boy highschooler. First appearance as light novel on 2012 followed by manga in the next year, both writtern by Takeru Kasukabe. The animation version has 10 eps on Fall 2013 and 1 OVA released on May 2014.\r\n    Straight to the plot! The harem story of a boy who surrounded by few \u2018weird\u2019 girls in his school, and he is known by the entire school itself for making so many fusses. The boy is suffering from a curse called \u201cAbsolute Choices\u201d, it gives him two or more choices, he isnot permitted to not choose one of it immediately or he will suffer from the extreme pain more than just a normal headache. Often, or mostly, the funny parts come from his undeniable choice, such an abnormal choices and circumstances he has to bear no matter what. This extreme school life of a boy and few girls I can\u2019t even imagine myself being stuck in the bunch of \u201cfreak\u201d peeps.\\n\\n\r\n    {SPOILER} To get rid of the \u201cAbsolute Choices\u201d curse he agrees helplessly the chance God sends to him through a girl who\u2019s falling from the sky in a random sunny day. Did I wrote \u2018God\u2019? Yeah it exactly is as you read. The \u2018God\u2019 appears normally as a minor character like in other series, but this one, this God, gets through him via cell phone. The notifications are the tasks Kanade Amakusa\u2014the name of the boy-must do, and forbid any failure, he needs to accomplish it during the given time, otherwise Kanade will not have any chance in the future to eradicate the curse. Along with the clumsy Chocolat\u2014the name of the falling girl from God-they try to finish every absurd tasks, perform unimaginable tasks in Kanade\u2019s school life.\\n\\n\\n\r\n    There are not much, just few supranatural thingy, I mean like simple magic tricks, pop-up things and other simple stuffs shown in the series. The genres are comedy, school life, slice-of-life, and ecchi. I describe the ecchi-ness in this show as indicate sexual appeals from those girls, and the harem scenes appear like tons of comedy scenes. The characters surely affect the whole show since it\u2019s about comedy, so the problems, personalities, situations, the feels, from extremely varied cast are needed to give the best comedy scenes. I might say it\u2019s above average but not too high, yes it is funny however. As usual, the ecchi-ness sometimes bothers me, because in few scenes it feels off or they shouldn\u2019t be there and it can be more funny w/o that way.\\n\\n\r\n    The theme songs are..ummm maybe fun, and it's catchy. It's hard to describe, can't find the right words for it. By the way, the OP is sung by Afilia Saga \"S\u30fbM\u30fbL\u2606\" & the ED theme \"Taiyou to Tsuki no Cross\" (\u592a\u967d\u3068\u6708\u306eCROSS) by TWO-FORMULA (Kaori Sadohara & Saeko Zougou).\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe rating I give is 5 ! You can choose this one for fun, watch it when you're bored can relieve your bad day.\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nFunny, such a ridiculous story\\n\r\nGood graphics for school life story\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nSometimes the funny scenes feel off or too harsh\\n\r\nThe main point here just the humour and ecchi-ness\\n",

I'll start with the negatives and end with the positives.\r\nOverall, this series is quite generic, as the characters, their development, and interactions are very common for this whole \"fan-servicey, school romance, comedy, harem\" type anime. It does try to set itself apart by forcing a seemingly metaphysical concept like \"Every choice in your life affects the world\" down your throat in the first episode. However, the best way to watch this series is to not take it so seriously. This concept is never taken further than purely for the sake of comedy and some light romance.\r\nAs for myenjoyment; as a whole, it was fairly enjoyable. It was filled with (again, generic) situational \"cringe\" comedy, which is always reliable to fall back upon. In a series like this, this type of comedy fits well. The characters were also fairly likable.\\n\r\nThis series is good, NOT a masterpiece, and NOT a piece of crap. Don't make the mistake of thinking there is some deep meaning to it as this will cause you to either fall in love with it for a reason that does not exist, or hate it for forcing your high expectations upon it.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "Absolute Choice is not an amazing series, but neither is it terrible- in many ways it is average, and in some ways, it almost exceeds expectations, almost. The story,sadly, is quite predictable despite the premise allowing interesting twists and turns. Although not every aspect of the story is entirely foreseeable, the general plot is easy enough to anticipate. The art is average in quality, though there was some interesting concepts and ideas that, sometimes, were represented visually in a clever manner. The op is serviceable, with a passable song. I found the voice acting quite decent at times, if slightly odd at certain intervals. Thehighlight, for me, was the individual choices that the main character, Kanade Amakusa, is  forced to make throughout the series; this added some flavor to episodes that would otherwise be uninteresting and bland.  The characters were decent, if not good- effort was made in an attempt to develop these characters. They have actual personality and and aren't just walking clich\u00e9s; sometimes the characters actually make tough decisions, where it isn't entirely clear what they will do, though this doesn't mitigate the lacking story. The series, I found, was fairly enjoyable, but didn't live up to its potential, with the possibilities made viable with the somewhat unique idea.",

Plenty of fanservice, eccentric characters and a plot that allows for some creative comedic possibilities are all jumbled together in hopes of cohesion but feel far too disjointed to keep a decent pace. The strongest point for this show was its eccentric cast but it was very hit or miss and tended use them to sequel bait for their next season.",

            "content": "I liked this series because it's something different from what you usually expect from a harem based anime. What I look for in a good anime series are characters that are distinctively different from one another and have a personality that anyone who watches it, would fall in love with. I couldn't help but to hide my face when certain characters showed their unique charm while watching it. What this anime does best is not just focus on the main character but instead, put special attention all the characters (even the ones that are occasionally shown) that's in each episode. I'm not going to getinto the whole back story on what the anime is because you can easily get the general idea from the overview that the website gives. \\n\\n\r\nI was somewhat skeptical about how this anime was based on the main character suffering from \"Absolute Choice\". Choose one or the other. When you think of that, especially in a harem series, you would expect heartbreak 24/7 because while one character is happy, the other would be sad. This anime did not take that approach by making this series a very heart-wrenching drama where you're going to bawl your eyes out. The choices that are given to the protagonist in this anime are... very different and entertaining to witness.\\n\\n\r\nThis is without a doubt a series that everyone should watch.",
