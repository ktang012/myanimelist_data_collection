I was always a bit of an Inuyasha critic. The recycled story lines and sub plots turned me off a lot. I watch this out of pure curiosity and found myself deeply emotionally involved in it. Several episodes nearly made me cry for characters that I had pervious lacked interest in. \r\nThe series was definitely a massive improvement from the original seasons, and it is refreshing to fans and non fans alike. It is highly character driven, though there isstill a ton of action and a few goofy side stories to keep you fully entertained. The plot progression is much faster than the original series, and in some ways, you see the story/characters develop more in The Final Act then they did in the entirety of the original series. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nThe art was also a bit improved and glossed over. There are a few times when you want to sit back and just admire the back round and some of the magic. It looks as though they have incorporated some 3D elements in it. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: \\n\\n\r\nLike all of the Inuyasha season, the music does not fail to impress. The opening/endings are catchy and easy on the ears, and the backgrund score does a lot to compliment the personality of what is going on at the time. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIt is *very* worth watching, especially for those who had given up on Inuyasha. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

Throughout the regular series, there were lots of fillers and silly episodes that lacked \"meat\" however each episode of the final season of Inuyasha was filled with a moving plot-line that at times had me crying. The action in this season was amazing and it was nice how characters that were minor or were not that likable during the regular broadcast were brought to new light. \r\nThe art as always was clean and enjoyable. But the development of the characters was spectacular! I am so gladthat the ending was the way it was. What I hoped for all along. \\n\\n\r\nSo glad I watched it and highly recommend to others as well!",

            "content": "Inyuasha: Second Season Review -\r\nTo a man who completely watched every single Inuyasha episode known to man, I want to point out that this here is one of the most miraculous things ever. \r\nStory - The story takes wherever the last story picked of. I found this to be much better than the 167 episodes the original one took place. The psychological impact of the story stunned me to no end, making me marathon this over and over again. Truly amazing. 10/10\r\nCharacters - Out of all the characters in this series, Kagome evolved the most. Not to say that the others stayed the same, butKagome. She played the most significant role and completely carried the show. Unfortunately, the way Inuyasha changed was completely irrelevant in any standard and should not be mentioned again, overall best character development. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound - You may not realize it, but the dub for this show was gorgeous. You could say that this is dubbing gone right. It made the show feel very realistic and logical in every aspect of the story. Don't forget the OST. Truly just gorgeous. I spent $20 downloading the Inuyasha OST and not once regretting it. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art style for this was pretty astounding, feeling refined like my new born child. He was born yesterday April 4, 2014  at 12:27 AM while I was finishing up this show. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Disregarding what ever my wife says about this show, it will always be 1st in my life. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall - This was a masterpiece of a show that i would never recommend the first season to. It was glorious in all aspects. In the honor I gave my son the middle name of InuYasha 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIm out and never forgot to blaze it.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "InuYasha: Kanketsu-hen, or InuYasha: The Final Act, is the final segment of the show that has taken the anime world by storm in 2000. The first, long, season of InuYasha was incredible when it comes to storyline and character. Everything was engaging!...except the ending of it. Having such a long air-time and not have a proper ending to it was a real downer. InuYasha: Kanketsu-hen puts everything into place, and tears in some viewers' eyes ;)\r\nStory (10) Definitely one of the more in-depth storylines in anime. The show takes you back in time, well it literally does each time Kagome goes through her family's well,to see peoples' pasts to see how everyone is connected to each other. The story picks up where the first season ended, Inuyasha and company are going after Naraku to end his evil in their world. This is the main story, but things that weren't taken care of in the first season were finally given a resting place. What I mean by this is things like \"What happened to Inuyasha-Kagome-Kikyou love triangle?!?\" are finally resolved and definite. \\n\r\n                Something that I would like to point out is the pacing of this continuation series. This 26 episode ending is NOT rushed, everything is greatly paced.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8) A definite improvement in animation, but not to the extent that it is extremely noticeable. The animation style is kept the same, which is great because I believe that having the same character animation is crucial in the overall enjoyment of the anime. An example for this would be the Minami-ke series where all 4 seasons are animated differently because they were made in 4 different studios. It had an obvious effect to many of the views, including myself. Animation is smooth and attractive, yet not too flashy.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10) Music in the InuYasha series have always been great! Song likes Dearest - Ayume Hamasaki, Every Heart - Boa, Fukai Mori - Do As Infinity, and Rakuen - Do As Infinity, are great examples of the awesome music. Music is incorporated into the anime well with the timing of it, and also the selection of music they use. In fact, my first spine-chilling experience while watching anime came from this show. It was due to the mix of what was happening in the anime and the song that came with it. When I think of great music in anime I think of InuYasha immediately.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10) The complex relationship between Inuyasha, Kagome, and Kikyou is one of the most engaging subjects of anime that I have ever seen. The anime does a great job in taking time with character development. You do not have to worry about not understanding why things happen, because the anime explains, or has explained, why. The characters are original, that is what I love about them. I love that they all have pasts, especially Inuyasha and Kikyou. It adds so much more depth to the story. Another thing I love about the characters is the timing of their actions. They are themselves when nothing is going on, and they serious, but still themselves, when something is happening. They have dimension. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9) Just an absolutely fitting ending to a great series. It was well made, and while typing that I just told myself I wish I could watch this for the first time again. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9) An extremely high 9 rating in my books. Recommend it to anyone, especially to those that are interested in action, romance, drama, and some comedy.",

            "content": "Inuyasha: The Final Act is meant to continue where its early 2000s prequel had left off in the continuing plot of Inuyasha and his allies trying to stop Naraku and his plans with the Shikon no Tama. I might as well address the major issue with this series first that comes in the form of its pacing. A good chunk of the anime is quite notable for rushing through many of the major events of the series from the manga, which include cutting out, rearranging or altering key scenes. This has the negative effect of reducing any time that could be focused on how saidevents effect the characters, developing the events that lead to key points in the series from occurring or getting into dramatic scenes. The third is especially a notable one here as a few major characters in the series die due to Naraku's manipulations, yet their deaths lack much of the emotional punch they could have had thanks to Final Act's pacing.\\n\\n\r\nThings finally start slowing with the pacing towards the middle of the series when Magatsuhi makes his presence felt and the final battle with Naraku unfolds. This made for the genuinely engaging high point of the series as things concerning the true nature of the Shikon Jewel are revealed and Naraku pulls out all the stops to try killing off Inuyasha and his companions in their final battle, whether through his usual manipulations or through directly attacking them. The anime adds in some scenes and developments not seen in the manga such as Kagome going through her high school exams and one of Naraku's incarnations getting some fleshing out that the manga never went into. They're decent little touches for the anime, though the latter development lacks some of the punch it could have had thanks to the fast pacing throughout a good chunk of the series. The later episodes also suffer through a few rather convenient developments that serve to make more pleasant resolutions for events in the series, particularly with the title's ending.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, Inuyasha: The Final Act retains the animation style employed through the first series, while sporting slightly smoother details and more moments of fluid animation this time around since Final Act's length is nowhere as large as the first series. The soundtrack retains much of the insert musical pieces used from the original series, while incorporating J-Pop themes for opener and closer sequences. The insert tracks still fit in well with key scenes, but the J-pop songs are mood killers that aren't too fitting with Final Act's mood.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Final Act's a step down in quality compared to the first series. While having slightly better quality visuals and the later episodes being quite engaging for the final battle with Naraku, the title's pacing for a good chunk of its run still killed much of the buildup and suspense that led up to the latter. It's somewhat regrettable that the anime adaptations of the series had to end on an underwhelming note such as this.",

            "content": "I simply had to write something after watching the twentieth episode. \r\nThis review is based on the assumption that the first series Inuyasha has been watched. Like most other people, I was kind of unsure to write a review on Inuyasha Kanketsu-ken because it's pretty much the continuation of the first season, but there are quite a few differences from the old season to this recent one. \r\nStory: Most people are deterred from watching the previous seasons because it honestly is basically episodes and episodes of filler. I, personally get turned down by filler, but this series is pretty much the concluding wrap up ofthe whole Inuyasha storyline. So each episode has an in-depth meaning and it's pretty important not to skip over, or something will definitely be missed. If you think each episode is fight scene, fight scene etc, don't worry it's not all of it. Yes there is fighting still, because they are trying to get Naraku....\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art design seemed a lot cleaner and crisp. I especially enjoyed the ending themes and opening theme imagery; definitely great effort was used to create some of the graphics. (Check out second ending theme song, and you'll know what I mean). I am really happy that they didn't change the art of the characters too much, because of course it is a continuation. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Thank GOODNESS for SAME VOICE ACTORS. I would have had a tizzy if someone else voiced Inuyasha or Sesshoumaru...but aside from the character's voices, the soundtrack is the exact same from the previous serie, so don't expect drastic music change in any part of this anime. EXCEPT in the opening and ending themes . I enjoyed the ENDING themes MUCH MUCH better than the previous series. They are much more emotional and heartfelt but still definitely has a beat to dance to. No ballads. And with the themes, the art is very scenic and enjoyable to just listen. I was so impressed by the songs With You by AAA (1st ending theme), Diamond by Alan (2nd ending theme) and Down the Distant Road by Takekawa Ai (3rd ending theme). They are all so good to listen to, and the art definitely fits the songs. The water ripples and luminescent sakura petals kept my eyes drawn to the scenery in the 3rd ending with such awe. I am currently obsessed with trying to find the release of the single and so forth. That's how good it was. Right Visuals +  Right melody = Absolute perfection. Don't get me wrong, the other two endings were just as good. Definitely check them out. I am not writing much about the opening because it is the same one throughout the anime, plus it's a little more slap happy than the endings...kind of contrasts a bit :/ but that doesn't take away from it. I enjoy listening to Do As Infinity just as much. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: They pretty much condensed the numbers of characters. So a lot of filler characters, and some side characters are not featured anymore. Any fans of Koga or such  will be sad to see that there will be very little of him featured.",

The episode wouldn't even make much sense to people who haven't read the manga; I read the manga and even I had a hard time understanding what was going on.\r\n The animators provided no recap. They just dived right into the middle of it. I know it's understood that the viewer can watch theInuYasha series on Hulu, but after over four years of being off the air, I expect some sort of recap.\\n\\n\r\n I have to say, I'm disappointed with it. I had to stop watching after the first couple of episodes. They were just trying to milk the last bit from this cash cow.",

            "content": "Inuyasha is the biggest dissapointment for me, I'v seen u gave him big ratings and I wonder why...really.*spoiler alert* If u havent seen the anime yet dont read. \r\n When I started watching I was expecting a classic fairytale with good vs evil, romance and good always wins, stuff that now is avoided today, everyone trying to be original. So the reasons my ratings are so low:\r\nStory:  The main reason everyone is chasing after Noraku is revenge and personal interests not for some good cause, revenge for Kikyo, revenge for Miroku's father and wind tunnel curse, revenge for family(Sango, Shippo),Kagome initially seeks to repair the mistake she made destroying the shard, etc. There are some boring episodes that have no connection with main story or the relations between characters. \\n\r\n   The MAIN reason i disliked the story was the ending, a much better ending would be if Sesshomaru used his sword to bring Kagura back to live(so in the end everyone is ok) and if the final choice(or \"the right choice\") was made by Inuyasha because in the whole anime he is the one undecided between choosing to be a full demon or a human.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Characters in this story have many flaws, they dont have much depth and complexity, Inuyasha even as half-demon is much more stronger than the other demons...so why become full-demon then? Most of the time they are indecided, and wandering around looking for Naraku, they rely on Inuyasha's sword to much.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 90% of the faces are a semicircles with a point as a nose and small ears, the only difference is the hair, clothing and size. There is a huge lack or facial expresions, only the eyes change sometimes.\\n\r\n  Exept the strong, main demons the rest of the demons are the same, forming massive demon groups that die instant and verry easy, have no blood, no limbs, as if they are made from dirt or wet sand(like sand castles @%@ ). The costumes are interesting enough and the colors are clear and well made.\\n\r\nSounds: The opening and end music is good, but sound efects are verry verry bad, also I watched english dubbed and the voices...big fail.\\n\\n\r\n  Maybe i was to critical beacuse i was expecting better, also i'v heard manga is better. This was my 1st review (a bit rushed, i could write more but would be to boring with details) so I would like your opinions, I'm verry critical and I dont give high ratings because is something is popular and I don't really enjoy giving notes like \"5 out of 10\", opinions are better. Sorry for any english mistakes. Have fun.",

It sets off where there are no fillers anymore, it's direct, and it tends to even every special part for each character in an episode. The last InuYasha episode in the last season made go like: \"Wait...thats it???\" I glad they had finished it just like the manga or that cliffhanger may be a way InuYasha had some of its fans. But, must it have been regained thanks to this season!\r\nStory: 10 out of 10\r\nThank goodness to no filler episodes! They acutally go to more of the important parts of thestory, unlike a demon in village and Inuyasha and the gang get rid of it. It shows more the characters part of view in each episode whether it's about him/her or not. What stands out the most to me was that if you got confused about a certain moment, they would explain the reason to you more directly than in quote or something else.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 out of 10\\n\r\nI have to admit it, they made the characters look even better and fresher than before! You can tell more of the characters expression and the setting better. From the characters, demons, trees, and etc.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music: 10 out of 10 \\n\r\nFor the music, the OPs and EDs truely match with the scenery. They may have used some of the same music before but still, it fits perfectly which each scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:10 out of 10\\n\r\nHmm...character...nothing really changed except the feelings in the couples people mostly favored. Though I saw a couple I favored and I went like \"Yes! Its offical!!\"\\n\\n\r\nOveral: 10 out of 10\\n\r\nI loved everything about this InuYasha season! It was better than ever as a surprise to me!~ (Small but I explained everything above)\\n\\n\r\n~ MidnightSky \\n",

I am so glad that for the last season of Inuyasha they did almost exactly like the manga. Inuyasha was the first anime i ever took seriously. There is just so much to love about this show, that you wish it will never end. But all good things must come to an end eventually. \r\nTears were brought to my eyes as i watched the last episode and was very happy with the way they ended. There wereno loose ends what so ever.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot to this story was very unique and original which is one of the reasons that i liked it so much. You never knew what to expect from this and you could never predict what would happen next, well at least i couldn't.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show were incredible, so many different things to each and everyone of them. The characters were what surprised me the most though. You could see with each episode that the characters were changing bit by bit, and you just can't help but fall in love with them.\\n\\n\r\n The art was incredible. Each scene was drawn with such detail and care, it made me like the show even more. \\n\\n\r\n I thought the voice acting for both the English version and Japanese version were really well done. The Japanese voice actors are always flawless, but i can't say the same for American voice acting but i have to say it was very well done on both parts.\\n\\n\r\nInuyasha was a wonderful watch and read, and i would do it all again in a heartbeat. It was fun and exciting, and it also kept you on your toes. This is absolutely a must watch.",

            "content": "I decided to write this review because I feel that reviews here haven't done much justice to this show. Which is strange, as the ranking and relative popularity of this show would suggest that a decent review be written about it.\r\nTo start off, I LOVE inuyasha. I loved the first show. I loved the characters and their interactions. I thought the music was great, and that the story was really special and addictive. The first 10 episodes or so were especially good. Then, after about 40 episodes, I realised Naraku wouldn\u2019t die. And the show began to drag on and on. At the end, Ihad mixed feelings about the quality of the show, but it didn\u2019t change the fact that I was really into the show, which hasn\u2019t changed even now. Therefore, there will be inevitable comparisons with the first 167 episodes, as those episodes are what created the emotional backdrop for me as I watched this final piece from the series.\\n\r\nBut to summarise this long review, Kanketsu-hen IS great.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nI\u2019ll start off by saying something bad \u2013 the pacing IS terrible, especially at the start. It became better in the middle, and was really great at the end. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact it sucked in the beginning. If not for my utmost love for the show, I might have thought of giving it up. There is no way that viewers from 5 years ago are going to pick up this show comfortably. No flashback, no summary, no nothing. Even if you treated it as episode 168, the pacing was still really off, given the fact that the previous series was sooo slow, and where things were given TOO MUCH time to stagnate in development. The pacing also affected the emotional weight as the characters felt like they could have been fleshed out more, and scenarios were not given sufficient time to develop. I heard there were side stories spanning a few chapters in the manga compressed into 1 minute in the show. This may have been justified by Sunrise due to an episode limit that was put out for whatever reasons, but it still cannot be denied that the problem exists.\\n\r\nNevertheless, they did well enough given the constraints to tell a decent story at the start, and the story develops really well in the middle and at the end. In order not to spoil anything, I\u2019ll just say that developments here are the quality of what made me love Inuyasha in the first place. Humour, which was one thing that defined Inuyasha, is also present here, albeit much less often, as it usually appears in fillers. It was probably because of the episode constraints that they couldn\u2019t waste time with much humorous side-events that would delay the story, which was a tad disappointing considering that humour was one of the main highlights of relationship fillers in the old Inuyasha. However, I really still enjoyed whatever Sunrise could dish out within the limits. And most important of all, in 26 episodes Sunrise delivered what they couldn\u2019t in 167 episodes and 4 movies: a closure. That, in itself, is a major plus point to fans of the series like me. I give a relatively high 8 for the amount that Sunrise managed to achieve with just 26 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nIn my opinion, Inuyasha has one of the most likeable casts in anime. The protagonists are well designed and cute, although a little predictable and clich\u00e9d. The main villain, while being the source of endless fights which frustrate no one as much as the viewers for the sheer number of episodes created, is quite a mean character in the anime world. There are also other interesting villains and anti-hero characters in Inuyasha, and all in all the cast is pretty amazing. The seiyuus are also awesome. Kappei Yamaguchi IS Inuyasha, and while annoying at times, Satsuki Yukino portrays a very in-character Kagome. Other highlights include Naraku and Kagura. The real highlight in Inuyasha, however, is the development of the characters, and it goes to a new level in Kanketsu-hen, especially accounting for the fact that they had so few episodes and such a big story to work with. The triangular love relationship has always been the emotional mainstay of the original series, and it is further elaborated in Kanketsu-hen. This is especially true between Inuyasha and Kagome, as the final episode really shows how far their love has progressed, and their outcome really tugs at the strings of our hearts. Another highlight is the development of secondary antagonists and anti-heroes in Inuyasha. I am amazed to see what they did with Kagura and Kanna with so little time, and of course our favourite Sesshomaru is fleshed out in the way that old fans expected him to.\\n\r\nHowever, one character still manages to irritate my every nerve, and that is dear little Shippo. I never understood the need for a character like Shippo. I didn\u2019t find him cute, didn\u2019t find him funny, but found him really annoying, and he didn\u2019t go through much development as well. I guess not every show can pull off a Kero-chan of CCS.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 10\\n\r\nI am not a typical reviewer of anime in the music department. I look a lot less into OPs and EDs, and a lot more into anime BGM. With that being said, however, I must still admit that the opening theme is awesome, and I sure as hell am glad they didn't change it at all. It\u2019s really nice that after being stopped for 6 years, Inuyasha has started again with hands down the best opening of all 7 in the series, which is the perfect sign for things to come. While it definitely doesn't provide the nostalgia of songs like \"Fukai Mori\", 1 year later it has already become one of my favourite anime openings. I'm not a big fan of the ending themes though, but they are decent to say the least.\\n\r\nBack to the point why I see anime BGM more importantly. To me the BGM can make or break an anime, just like how important the soundtrack is to people who appreciate Hans Zimmer, Nobuo Uematsu, or any well-known composer of OSTs. I feel that OPs and EDs only serve as a kick and thrill, separate from the enjoyment of the show, whereas the BGM forms part of the viewing experience, and accompanies the viewer for almost the entire time, making it a much more important aspect of any show.  And the BGM in Inuyasha is absolutely amazing. I'm not sure how many new songs were composed, or how many of the songs were reworked from the original series, but they certainly retain their original spirit, be it the heart-wrenching nature of emotional songs like Kikyo's theme, or foreboding themes of Naraku that scream cunning and evil. Kaoru Wada likes to use traditional Japanese instruments like flutes and zithers to invoke medieval tones into the songs, and it works extremely well in creating unique and emotional atmospheres that are seldom seen in anime. For a good example of the range of instruments used, one should hear track 8 \"Tomorrow\" in Kanketsu-hen's OST. While it definitely isn't flawless, much more attention is deserved of an anime BGM that is as good and consistent as Inuyasha's, and I dare say should come close to those of Cowboy Bebop's (although the range is incomparable). The final aspect that seals the perfect rating for the music, however, is the perfect timing that music is injected into scenes in the show; it is the perfect catalyst to spark off the adrenaline, emotion, or light-heartedness of each scene in the show. I would go as far to say that the music MADE the scenes. For the best example, look for a particularly emotional scene at the end of episode 2.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7\\n\r\nI usually don't really care a lot about animation, so this section is a little short. The art is very similar to the old anime, which is really great for old fans like me, but for usual standards it is just better than decent, given what some of the anime shows now are capable of. What strikes me is the detail that the team gives to the background of the countryside. It really is a pretty sight of clouds and lush green trees, if you focus on the background for an instant. Animation is good and fluid, but not fantastic. From my memory, it does seem more consistent than the old episodes, but I never really cared that much anyway.\\n\\n\r\nTilt/Enjoyment: 10\\n\r\nTo be honest, I really love the old Inuyasha series. For all the hate that amassed as the fillers slowly got on my nerves, I still love the show, even though there are so many recent shows better than it. It\u2019s one of the few animes that still bring back memories for me, possibly due to the influence it had on me in my teen years, and I brought these feelings with me as I watched the show from start to end. I also found it strange that they decided to carry on a series that was so dated in its popularity. And, with seiyuus that were 10 years older, I wondered if the show would still keep its heart and soul that has made the show so incredibly addictive and memorable. But at the end my final verdict was, \u201cThank God they made this show. Really thank God.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Kanketsu-hen as a fan of the series. For haters of the show, I suggest you don\u2019t watch it, as there\u2019s probably nothing that\u2019ll change your mind. For people who haven\u2019t seen Inuyasha, you could try watching Kanketsu-hen to the end, but the pacing at the start will probably turn you off. But for fans who haven\u2019t watched it, WATCH IT; it\u2019s a show for the fans. A 9 to Sunrise from a fan.",

I've been a dedicated Inuyasha fan since I was little and have watched all 169 episodes over and over not really satisfied with the ending. Until the adaption to the final ending of the manga series came out and man was it awesome. This series cleared up all the loose ends from the unsatisfying ending of the prequel.\r\n____________________Spoiler____________________________________\r\nAnd also finally Inuyasha and Kagome are together (SCREAMS!!!!!) I'm glad to be able to see the ending of a good series.",

Her drawings went along perfectly, the story was absolute, the characters' voices matched the prior character, the characters' outcome fitted perfectly to their image, and it was a series that I will continue to enjoy for the rest of my life. The anime didn't have everything the manga had, but the scenes did go in order as planned. \r\nThis review is dedicated to Rumiko Takahashi; thank you for making Inuyasha and bring the series into our lives. :)",

It is not a very complex plot with too many twists but it is certainly enough to keep you attached and entertained.\r\nJust a heads up for those who watched theEnglish dub of the original series, Kagome's and Sesshomaru's voice actors were switched so you may get a bit irritated, I just decided to watch it in Japanese. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways enjoy the series if you watch it, I'd really recommend it.",

            "content": "Indeed, this series became popular and it was great that the fans like me, was able see a closure after waiting for years. Inuyasha was one of those series that will leave you an impression which will make you still remember it even after so many years. \r\nThere\u2019s a long review coming!\r\nABOUT THE STORY\r\nThe story itself was rich with actions, adventure, drama, and of course romance. It was unique in its own way with a story that transcended time. But there was these feelings which make you realize that it could\u2019ve been much better. There were times that you felt bored with the episodes andjust forwarded it or the worst, went to the next episode. Throughout the series, it felt like there was still something missing and I ended up wanting for more. It felt like there were still rooms for improvement.  Even the dialogues were too much of a clich\u00e9. And dialogues are one of the most important parts of a good story. Something that will leave an impression to the viewers. I strongly believed that with a great main storyline, interesting characters, captivating landscape, and beautiful soundtrack, the series could\u2019ve been much better. The series could\u2019ve given more of its greatness. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed the whole thing and still believed that it was still worth watching. \\n\r\nThe strongest story in the series was the very unique type of love story between the protagonists. The two female leading character whose supposedly one form of being but still two different individuals. The other girl from the past who Inuyasha still had a strong bond even after falling in love with Kagome and the other girl from the future who Inuyasha learned to love more than he realized he could. The conflicting love interest for two people whose originally one being. A love story that really transcended time.  \\n\\n\r\nABOUT THE CHARACTERS\\n\r\nEvery character was interesting and will end up making you amused. The almost all the time bickering Sango and Miroku, the very cute Shippo, the very annoying demon Naraku, the enigmatic girl from the past Kikyo, the girl from the future who even though had lots of insecurities still had a very strong heart Kagome, and of course, the very cute, hot-tempered, funny little doggy Inuyasha. Even the villains were really annoying and will make you really root for the main casts to finish all of them. Despite that, I think with the wide range of characters and one of the longest running series, the characters should\u2019ve have been explored more. Not all series is given the chance to explore their characters because of the short storyline. The series should\u2019ve have taken the advantage of the long storyline to truly explain some of the important characters and not only the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nABOUT THE ANIMATION and SOUND\\n\r\nI strongly believed that the only flawless point of Inuyasha was its beautiful and captivating soundtracks. The sounds were really great. Whether it was an action scene, drama scene or even romantic scene, the backgrounds was really great. It was well- used in every episode. I am really glad that they still used the same important soundtracks in the show even after many years and even used it in the final act. \\n\\n\r\nIt was really great to finally see the anime version of the ending of Inuyasha. It was satisfying for a closure.\\n",

I was always a bit of an Inuyasha critic. The recycled story lines and sub plots turned me off a lot. I watch this out of pure curiosity and found myself deeply emotionally involved in it. Several episodes nearly made me cry for characters that I had pervious lacked interest in. \r\nThe series was definitely a massive improvement from the original seasons, and it is refreshing to fans and non fans alike. It is highly character driven, though there isstill a ton of action and a few goofy side stories to keep you fully entertained. The plot progression is much faster than the original series, and in some ways, you see the story/characters develop more in The Final Act then they did in the entirety of the original series. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nThe art was also a bit improved and glossed over. There are a few times when you want to sit back and just admire the back round and some of the magic. It looks as though they have incorporated some 3D elements in it. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: \\n\\n\r\nLike all of the Inuyasha season, the music does not fail to impress. The opening/endings are catchy and easy on the ears, and the backgrund score does a lot to compliment the personality of what is going on at the time. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIt is *very* worth watching, especially for those who had given up on Inuyasha. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

I found this to be much better than the 167 episodes the original one took place. The psychological impact of the story stunned me to no end, making me marathon this over and over again. Truly amazing. 10/10\r\nCharacters - Out of all the characters in this series, Kagome evolved the most. Not to say that the others stayed the same, butKagome. She played the most significant role and completely carried the show. Unfortunately, the way Inuyasha changed was completely irrelevant in any standard and should not be mentioned again, overall best character development. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound - You may not realize it, but the dub for this show was gorgeous. You could say that this is dubbing gone right. It made the show feel very realistic and logical in every aspect of the story. Don't forget the OST. Truly just gorgeous. I spent $20 downloading the Inuyasha OST and not once regretting it. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt - The art style for this was pretty astounding, feeling refined like my new born child. He was born yesterday April 4, 2014  at 12:27 AM while I was finishing up this show. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Disregarding what ever my wife says about this show, it will always be 1st in my life. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall - This was a masterpiece of a show that i would never recommend the first season to. It was glorious in all aspects. In the honor I gave my son the middle name of InuYasha 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIm out and never forgot to blaze it.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "InuYasha: Kanketsu-hen, or InuYasha: The Final Act, is the final segment of the show that has taken the anime world by storm in 2000. The first, long, season of InuYasha was incredible when it comes to storyline and character. Everything was engaging!...except the ending of it. Having such a long air-time and not have a proper ending to it was a real downer. InuYasha: Kanketsu-hen puts everything into place, and tears in some viewers' eyes ;)\r\nStory (10) Definitely one of the more in-depth storylines in anime. The show takes you back in time, well it literally does each time Kagome goes through her family's well,to see peoples' pasts to see how everyone is connected to each other. The story picks up where the first season ended, Inuyasha and company are going after Naraku to end his evil in their world. This is the main story, but things that weren't taken care of in the first season were finally given a resting place. What I mean by this is things like \"What happened to Inuyasha-Kagome-Kikyou love triangle?!?\" are finally resolved and definite. \\n\r\n                Something that I would like to point out is the pacing of this continuation series. This 26 episode ending is NOT rushed, everything is greatly paced.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8) A definite improvement in animation, but not to the extent that it is extremely noticeable. The animation style is kept the same, which is great because I believe that having the same character animation is crucial in the overall enjoyment of the anime. An example for this would be the Minami-ke series where all 4 seasons are animated differently because they were made in 4 different studios. It had an obvious effect to many of the views, including myself. Animation is smooth and attractive, yet not too flashy.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10) Music in the InuYasha series have always been great! Song likes Dearest - Ayume Hamasaki, Every Heart - Boa, Fukai Mori - Do As Infinity, and Rakuen - Do As Infinity, are great examples of the awesome music. Music is incorporated into the anime well with the timing of it, and also the selection of music they use. In fact, my first spine-chilling experience while watching anime came from this show. It was due to the mix of what was happening in the anime and the song that came with it. When I think of great music in anime I think of InuYasha immediately.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10) The complex relationship between Inuyasha, Kagome, and Kikyou is one of the most engaging subjects of anime that I have ever seen. The anime does a great job in taking time with character development. You do not have to worry about not understanding why things happen, because the anime explains, or has explained, why. The characters are original, that is what I love about them. I love that they all have pasts, especially Inuyasha and Kikyou. It adds so much more depth to the story. Another thing I love about the characters is the timing of their actions. They are themselves when nothing is going on, and they serious, but still themselves, when something is happening. They have dimension. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9) Just an absolutely fitting ending to a great series. It was well made, and while typing that I just told myself I wish I could watch this for the first time again. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9) An extremely high 9 rating in my books. Recommend it to anyone, especially to those that are interested in action, romance, drama, and some comedy.",

            "content": "Inuyasha: The Final Act is meant to continue where its early 2000s prequel had left off in the continuing plot of Inuyasha and his allies trying to stop Naraku and his plans with the Shikon no Tama. I might as well address the major issue with this series first that comes in the form of its pacing. A good chunk of the anime is quite notable for rushing through many of the major events of the series from the manga, which include cutting out, rearranging or altering key scenes. This has the negative effect of reducing any time that could be focused on how saidevents effect the characters, developing the events that lead to key points in the series from occurring or getting into dramatic scenes. The third is especially a notable one here as a few major characters in the series die due to Naraku's manipulations, yet their deaths lack much of the emotional punch they could have had thanks to Final Act's pacing.\\n\\n\r\nThings finally start slowing with the pacing towards the middle of the series when Magatsuhi makes his presence felt and the final battle with Naraku unfolds. This made for the genuinely engaging high point of the series as things concerning the true nature of the Shikon Jewel are revealed and Naraku pulls out all the stops to try killing off Inuyasha and his companions in their final battle, whether through his usual manipulations or through directly attacking them. The anime adds in some scenes and developments not seen in the manga such as Kagome going through her high school exams and one of Naraku's incarnations getting some fleshing out that the manga never went into. They're decent little touches for the anime, though the latter development lacks some of the punch it could have had thanks to the fast pacing throughout a good chunk of the series. The later episodes also suffer through a few rather convenient developments that serve to make more pleasant resolutions for events in the series, particularly with the title's ending.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, Inuyasha: The Final Act retains the animation style employed through the first series, while sporting slightly smoother details and more moments of fluid animation this time around since Final Act's length is nowhere as large as the first series. The soundtrack retains much of the insert musical pieces used from the original series, while incorporating J-Pop themes for opener and closer sequences. The insert tracks still fit in well with key scenes, but the J-pop songs are mood killers that aren't too fitting with Final Act's mood.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Final Act's a step down in quality compared to the first series. While having slightly better quality visuals and the later episodes being quite engaging for the final battle with Naraku, the title's pacing for a good chunk of its run still killed much of the buildup and suspense that led up to the latter. It's somewhat regrettable that the anime adaptations of the series had to end on an underwhelming note such as this.",

I cant wait to see all the developments in this Act which are much more interesting than the previous Inuyasha developments. As always, i love their choice of theme songs, theyre the best and their illustrations are  moving. The art is the same as always, prety good and well thought out, beautiful landscapes and details. The story is getting better developments, especially with my favorite character Sesshoumaru :).",

            "content": "I simply had to write something after watching the twentieth episode. \r\nThis review is based on the assumption that the first series Inuyasha has been watched. Like most other people, I was kind of unsure to write a review on Inuyasha Kanketsu-ken because it's pretty much the continuation of the first season, but there are quite a few differences from the old season to this recent one. \r\nStory: Most people are deterred from watching the previous seasons because it honestly is basically episodes and episodes of filler. I, personally get turned down by filler, but this series is pretty much the concluding wrap up ofthe whole Inuyasha storyline. So each episode has an in-depth meaning and it's pretty important not to skip over, or something will definitely be missed. If you think each episode is fight scene, fight scene etc, don't worry it's not all of it. Yes there is fighting still, because they are trying to get Naraku....\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art design seemed a lot cleaner and crisp. I especially enjoyed the ending themes and opening theme imagery; definitely great effort was used to create some of the graphics. (Check out second ending theme song, and you'll know what I mean). I am really happy that they didn't change the art of the characters too much, because of course it is a continuation. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Thank GOODNESS for SAME VOICE ACTORS. I would have had a tizzy if someone else voiced Inuyasha or Sesshoumaru...but aside from the character's voices, the soundtrack is the exact same from the previous serie, so don't expect drastic music change in any part of this anime. EXCEPT in the opening and ending themes . I enjoyed the ENDING themes MUCH MUCH better than the previous series. They are much more emotional and heartfelt but still definitely has a beat to dance to. No ballads. And with the themes, the art is very scenic and enjoyable to just listen. I was so impressed by the songs With You by AAA (1st ending theme), Diamond by Alan (2nd ending theme) and Down the Distant Road by Takekawa Ai (3rd ending theme). They are all so good to listen to, and the art definitely fits the songs. The water ripples and luminescent sakura petals kept my eyes drawn to the scenery in the 3rd ending with such awe. I am currently obsessed with trying to find the release of the single and so forth. That's how good it was. Right Visuals +  Right melody = Absolute perfection. Don't get me wrong, the other two endings were just as good. Definitely check them out. I am not writing much about the opening because it is the same one throughout the anime, plus it's a little more slap happy than the endings...kind of contrasts a bit :/ but that doesn't take away from it. I enjoy listening to Do As Infinity just as much. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: They pretty much condensed the numbers of characters. So a lot of filler characters, and some side characters are not featured anymore. Any fans of Koga or such  will be sad to see that there will be very little of him featured.",

And if there was a bit of filler..... it was some entertaining one. The only thing was, everything was a bit rushed but still it was good.\r\nART: 9\r\nThe good quality art of the original was still there. Though there was a slight difference, the art looked quite fresh and crisp.\r\nSOUND: 10\r\nThe OP and Endings were at par withthe first series, which is saying something.\\n\r\nThe ending themes were first class while the OP too was in sync with the story.\\n\r\nThankfully, the seiyuu hadn't been changed and one still felt connected to the story and characters.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10\\n\r\nThough there was no significant character development, but the emotions of love, loss, grief, despair were enough to move me and... the characters FELT  real.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10\\n\r\nUndoubtedly enjoyable.

I beg to differ.\\n\r\nI WATCHED the WHOLE of series InuYasha along with ALL the movies just that I'd be able to watch this season of InuYasha after I was impressed by its promotional advertisements etc.",

The episode wouldn't even make much sense to people who haven't read the manga; I read the manga and even I had a hard time understanding what was going on.\r\n The animators provided no recap. They just dived right into the middle of it. I know it's understood that the viewer can watch theInuYasha series on Hulu, but after over four years of being off the air, I expect some sort of recap.\\n\\n\r\n I have to say, I'm disappointed with it.

            "content": "Inuyasha is the biggest dissapointment for me, I'v seen u gave him big ratings and I wonder why...really.*spoiler alert* If u havent seen the anime yet dont read. \r\n When I started watching I was expecting a classic fairytale with good vs evil, romance and good always wins, stuff that now is avoided today, everyone trying to be original. So the reasons my ratings are so low:\r\nStory:  The main reason everyone is chasing after Noraku is revenge and personal interests not for some good cause, revenge for Kikyo, revenge for Miroku's father and wind tunnel curse, revenge for family(Sango, Shippo),Kagome initially seeks to repair the mistake she made destroying the shard, etc. There are some boring episodes that have no connection with main story or the relations between characters. \\n\r\n   The MAIN reason i disliked the story was the ending, a much better ending would be if Sesshomaru used his sword to bring Kagura back to live(so in the end everyone is ok) and if the final choice(or \"the right choice\") was made by Inuyasha because in the whole anime he is the one undecided between choosing to be a full demon or a human.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Characters in this story have many flaws, they dont have much depth and complexity, Inuyasha even as half-demon is much more stronger than the other demons...so why become full-demon then? Most of the time they are indecided, and wandering around looking for Naraku, they rely on Inuyasha's sword to much.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 90% of the faces are a semicircles with a point as a nose and small ears, the only difference is the hair, clothing and size. There is a huge lack or facial expresions, only the eyes change sometimes.\\n\r\n  Exept the strong, main demons the rest of the demons are the same, forming massive demon groups that die instant and verry easy, have no blood, no limbs, as if they are made from dirt or wet sand(like sand castles @%@ ). The costumes are interesting enough and the colors are clear and well made.\\n\r\nSounds: The opening and end music is good, but sound efects are verry verry bad, also I watched english dubbed and the voices...big fail.\\n\\n\r\n  Maybe i was to critical beacuse i was expecting better, also i'v heard manga is better. This was my 1st review (a bit rushed, i could write more but would be to boring with details) so I would like your opinions, I'm verry critical and I dont give high ratings because is something is popular and I don't really enjoy giving notes like \"5 out of 10\", opinions are better. Sorry for any english mistakes. Have fun.",

It sets off where there are no fillers anymore, it's direct, and it tends to even every special part for each character in an episode.

But, must it have been regained thanks to this season!\r\nStory: 10 out of 10\r\nThank goodness to no filler episodes! They acutally go to more of the important parts of thestory, unlike a demon in village and Inuyasha and the gang get rid of it.

There is just so much to love about this show, that you wish it will never end. But all good things must come to an end eventually. \r\nTears were brought to my eyes as i watched the last episode and was very happy with the way they ended. There wereno loose ends what so ever.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot to this story was very unique and original which is one of the reasons that i liked it so much. You never knew what to expect from this and you could never predict what would happen next, well at least i couldn't.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show were incredible, so many different things to each and everyone of them. The characters were what surprised me the most though. You could see with each episode that the characters were changing bit by bit, and you just can't help but fall in love with them.\\n\\n\r\n The art was incredible. Each scene was drawn with such detail and care, it made me like the show even more. \\n\\n\r\n I thought the voice acting for both the English version and Japanese version were really well done. The Japanese voice actors are always flawless, but i can't say the same for American voice acting but i have to say it was very well done on both parts.\\n\\n\r\nInuyasha was a wonderful watch and read, and i would do it all again in a heartbeat. It was fun and exciting, and it also kept you on your toes. This is absolutely a must watch.",

            "content": "I decided to write this review because I feel that reviews here haven't done much justice to this show. Which is strange, as the ranking and relative popularity of this show would suggest that a decent review be written about it.\r\nTo start off, I LOVE inuyasha. I loved the first show. I loved the characters and their interactions. I thought the music was great, and that the story was really special and addictive. The first 10 episodes or so were especially good. Then, after about 40 episodes, I realised Naraku wouldn\u2019t die. And the show began to drag on and on. At the end, Ihad mixed feelings about the quality of the show, but it didn\u2019t change the fact that I was really into the show, which hasn\u2019t changed even now. Therefore, there will be inevitable comparisons with the first 167 episodes, as those episodes are what created the emotional backdrop for me as I watched this final piece from the series.\\n\r\nBut to summarise this long review, Kanketsu-hen IS great.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nI\u2019ll start off by saying something bad \u2013 the pacing IS terrible, especially at the start. It became better in the middle, and was really great at the end. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact it sucked in the beginning. If not for my utmost love for the show, I might have thought of giving it up. There is no way that viewers from 5 years ago are going to pick up this show comfortably. No flashback, no summary, no nothing. Even if you treated it as episode 168, the pacing was still really off, given the fact that the previous series was sooo slow, and where things were given TOO MUCH time to stagnate in development. The pacing also affected the emotional weight as the characters felt like they could have been fleshed out more, and scenarios were not given sufficient time to develop. I heard there were side stories spanning a few chapters in the manga compressed into 1 minute in the show. This may have been justified by Sunrise due to an episode limit that was put out for whatever reasons, but it still cannot be denied that the problem exists.\\n\r\nNevertheless, they did well enough given the constraints to tell a decent story at the start, and the story develops really well in the middle and at the end. In order not to spoil anything, I\u2019ll just say that developments here are the quality of what made me love Inuyasha in the first place. Humour, which was one thing that defined Inuyasha, is also present here, albeit much less often, as it usually appears in fillers. It was probably because of the episode constraints that they couldn\u2019t waste time with much humorous side-events that would delay the story, which was a tad disappointing considering that humour was one of the main highlights of relationship fillers in the old Inuyasha. However, I really still enjoyed whatever Sunrise could dish out within the limits. And most important of all, in 26 episodes Sunrise delivered what they couldn\u2019t in 167 episodes and 4 movies: a closure. That, in itself, is a major plus point to fans of the series like me. I give a relatively high 8 for the amount that Sunrise managed to achieve with just 26 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nIn my opinion, Inuyasha has one of the most likeable casts in anime. The protagonists are well designed and cute, although a little predictable and clich\u00e9d. The main villain, while being the source of endless fights which frustrate no one as much as the viewers for the sheer number of episodes created, is quite a mean character in the anime world. There are also other interesting villains and anti-hero characters in Inuyasha, and all in all the cast is pretty amazing. The seiyuus are also awesome. Kappei Yamaguchi IS Inuyasha, and while annoying at times, Satsuki Yukino portrays a very in-character Kagome. Other highlights include Naraku and Kagura. The real highlight in Inuyasha, however, is the development of the characters, and it goes to a new level in Kanketsu-hen, especially accounting for the fact that they had so few episodes and such a big story to work with. The triangular love relationship has always been the emotional mainstay of the original series, and it is further elaborated in Kanketsu-hen. This is especially true between Inuyasha and Kagome, as the final episode really shows how far their love has progressed, and their outcome really tugs at the strings of our hearts. Another highlight is the development of secondary antagonists and anti-heroes in Inuyasha. I am amazed to see what they did with Kagura and Kanna with so little time, and of course our favourite Sesshomaru is fleshed out in the way that old fans expected him to.\\n\r\nHowever, one character still manages to irritate my every nerve, and that is dear little Shippo. I never understood the need for a character like Shippo. I didn\u2019t find him cute, didn\u2019t find him funny, but found him really annoying, and he didn\u2019t go through much development as well. I guess not every show can pull off a Kero-chan of CCS.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 10\\n\r\nI am not a typical reviewer of anime in the music department. I look a lot less into OPs and EDs, and a lot more into anime BGM. With that being said, however, I must still admit that the opening theme is awesome, and I sure as hell am glad they didn't change it at all. It\u2019s really nice that after being stopped for 6 years, Inuyasha has started again with hands down the best opening of all 7 in the series, which is the perfect sign for things to come. While it definitely doesn't provide the nostalgia of songs like \"Fukai Mori\", 1 year later it has already become one of my favourite anime openings. I'm not a big fan of the ending themes though, but they are decent to say the least.\\n\r\nBack to the point why I see anime BGM more importantly. To me the BGM can make or break an anime, just like how important the soundtrack is to people who appreciate Hans Zimmer, Nobuo Uematsu, or any well-known composer of OSTs. I feel that OPs and EDs only serve as a kick and thrill, separate from the enjoyment of the show, whereas the BGM forms part of the viewing experience, and accompanies the viewer for almost the entire time, making it a much more important aspect of any show.  And the BGM in Inuyasha is absolutely amazing. I'm not sure how many new songs were composed, or how many of the songs were reworked from the original series, but they certainly retain their original spirit, be it the heart-wrenching nature of emotional songs like Kikyo's theme, or foreboding themes of Naraku that scream cunning and evil. Kaoru Wada likes to use traditional Japanese instruments like flutes and zithers to invoke medieval tones into the songs, and it works extremely well in creating unique and emotional atmospheres that are seldom seen in anime. For a good example of the range of instruments used, one should hear track 8 \"Tomorrow\" in Kanketsu-hen's OST. While it definitely isn't flawless, much more attention is deserved of an anime BGM that is as good and consistent as Inuyasha's, and I dare say should come close to those of Cowboy Bebop's (although the range is incomparable). The final aspect that seals the perfect rating for the music, however, is the perfect timing that music is injected into scenes in the show; it is the perfect catalyst to spark off the adrenaline, emotion, or light-heartedness of each scene in the show. I would go as far to say that the music MADE the scenes. For the best example, look for a particularly emotional scene at the end of episode 2.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7\\n\r\nI usually don't really care a lot about animation, so this section is a little short. The art is very similar to the old anime, which is really great for old fans like me, but for usual standards it is just better than decent, given what some of the anime shows now are capable of. What strikes me is the detail that the team gives to the background of the countryside. It really is a pretty sight of clouds and lush green trees, if you focus on the background for an instant. Animation is good and fluid, but not fantastic. From my memory, it does seem more consistent than the old episodes, but I never really cared that much anyway.\\n\\n\r\nTilt/Enjoyment: 10\\n\r\nTo be honest, I really love the old Inuyasha series. For all the hate that amassed as the fillers slowly got on my nerves, I still love the show, even though there are so many recent shows better than it. It\u2019s one of the few animes that still bring back memories for me, possibly due to the influence it had on me in my teen years, and I brought these feelings with me as I watched the show from start to end. I also found it strange that they decided to carry on a series that was so dated in its popularity. And, with seiyuus that were 10 years older, I wondered if the show would still keep its heart and soul that has made the show so incredibly addictive and memorable. But at the end my final verdict was, \u201cThank God they made this show. Really thank God.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Kanketsu-hen as a fan of the series. For haters of the show, I suggest you don\u2019t watch it, as there\u2019s probably nothing that\u2019ll change your mind. For people who haven\u2019t seen Inuyasha, you could try watching Kanketsu-hen to the end, but the pacing at the start will probably turn you off. But for fans who haven\u2019t watched it, WATCH IT; it\u2019s a show for the fans. A 9 to Sunrise from a fan.",

            "content": "Indeed, this series became popular and it was great that the fans like me, was able see a closure after waiting for years. Inuyasha was one of those series that will leave you an impression which will make you still remember it even after so many years. \r\nThere\u2019s a long review coming!\r\nABOUT THE STORY\r\nThe story itself was rich with actions, adventure, drama, and of course romance. It was unique in its own way with a story that transcended time. But there was these feelings which make you realize that it could\u2019ve been much better. There were times that you felt bored with the episodes andjust forwarded it or the worst, went to the next episode. Throughout the series, it felt like there was still something missing and I ended up wanting for more. It felt like there were still rooms for improvement.  Even the dialogues were too much of a clich\u00e9. And dialogues are one of the most important parts of a good story. Something that will leave an impression to the viewers. I strongly believed that with a great main storyline, interesting characters, captivating landscape, and beautiful soundtrack, the series could\u2019ve been much better. The series could\u2019ve given more of its greatness. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed the whole thing and still believed that it was still worth watching. \\n\r\nThe strongest story in the series was the very unique type of love story between the protagonists. The two female leading character whose supposedly one form of being but still two different individuals. The other girl from the past who Inuyasha still had a strong bond even after falling in love with Kagome and the other girl from the future who Inuyasha learned to love more than he realized he could. The conflicting love interest for two people whose originally one being. A love story that really transcended time.  \\n\\n\r\nABOUT THE CHARACTERS\\n\r\nEvery character was interesting and will end up making you amused. The almost all the time bickering Sango and Miroku, the very cute Shippo, the very annoying demon Naraku, the enigmatic girl from the past Kikyo, the girl from the future who even though had lots of insecurities still had a very strong heart Kagome, and of course, the very cute, hot-tempered, funny little doggy Inuyasha. Even the villains were really annoying and will make you really root for the main casts to finish all of them. Despite that, I think with the wide range of characters and one of the longest running series, the characters should\u2019ve have been explored more. Not all series is given the chance to explore their characters because of the short storyline. The series should\u2019ve have taken the advantage of the long storyline to truly explain some of the important characters and not only the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nABOUT THE ANIMATION and SOUND\\n\r\nI strongly believed that the only flawless point of Inuyasha was its beautiful and captivating soundtracks. The sounds were really great. Whether it was an action scene, drama scene or even romantic scene, the backgrounds was really great. It was well- used in every episode. I am really glad that they still used the same important soundtracks in the show even after many years and even used it in the final act. \\n\\n\r\nIt was really great to finally see the anime version of the ending of Inuyasha. It was satisfying for a closure.\\n",

            "content": "An excellent continuation to one of my favorite animes. \r\nOnce again, the stories were almost always interesting throughout, and if anything they were even better than the original, as since it was only 26 episodes long the plot was much tighter and faster paced. There were only a few weaker stories which fell back on medieval fantasy cliches, and sometimes the pacing was a bit TOO fast.\r\nThe new, modern animation looks fantastic throughout, and the art style still looks very nice. There were a lot of lovely scenes in the show.\r\nThe action scenes were just as exciting as ever, with some being overall highlights asthe animation was much more modern and looked better. \\n\\n\r\nThe humor and emotion remained solid, like in the original series, as the comedic and emotional episodes both hit their marks well.\\n\\n\r\nInuyasha and Miroku were still annoying, but Shippo and Sango were still great like in the original, and Kagome was fine.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it wrapped up the show very nicely. Would definitely recommend to anyone who's finished the original and wants to see more.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I had no intention of ever watching this because I knew what was going to happen in the end and Naraku is my only favorite character in this twenty-six anime return.\r\nThis will contain spoilers because I don't know any other way to explain myself without them.\r\nOkay so in the original anime I liked both Sesshomaru and Naraku and would not watch an episode if one or both were not in it. Well in the Final Act I find Sesshomaru to be less intelligent, more boring than he was before and nearly out of character from the original anime. I like that he cared so muchfor Rin, those scenes were nice. And it was so awesome to see his beautiful mother. But his actions half the time did not seem logical.\\n\\n\r\nAfter episode eight, Kohaku's shard is the only one left but to make the anime longer, the episodes following are training and sword related.  The brothers learn more about their swords and get new techniques to help them on their mission to kill Naraku. \\n\\n\r\nActually no. Since this is called Inuyasha, I should say he had to learn about his sword. Sesshomaru learning about his was just a pawn to help Inuyasha because after doing all the hard work, he ended up giving his sword's attack to Inuyasha.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that really made me sad in this anime is the death of Naraku's incarnations. No joke. I didn't even realize Kagura and Kanna grew on me until their last episodes aired. It was just so sad and really made me feel that this was going to be the end for Naraku. He was tossing everyone out and I wish he didn't though in Kagura's case I understood why.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Kanna, she talked more in this anime and oddly enough that is something I did not like. It seemed out of character for her to recite a poem. That is the most she talked throughout.\\n\\n\r\nI already know what happen in the end and I don't want to see it. I want to remember Naraku as a powerful, handsome demon and nothing more.",

For an anime that was made awhile ago it has amazing story and character development.\r\nI watched the entire series in one go ,watching it everyday because its so enjoyable. It never ceases to amuse me the way the characters argue and how comedic it is when Kagome returns home with InuYasha.\r\nIf you haven't seenthis series I highly recommend watching InuYasha and The Finale Act, they are both amazing series that deserver the best praise.",

            "content": "InuYasha the Final Act is a good ending to the amazing InuYasha series. Sadly, its only 26 episodes. Still, its great, and enjoyable. For anyone looking for a long, fun series, InuYasha is a must watch.(of course, start from the frist part of the anime).\r\nStoryline9/10-NO SPOILERS. InuYasha the Final Act follows Dog Demon InuYasha, and his friends, Kagome, Shippo, Miroku, and Sango. They are all after Naraku, the evil Demon who has the Scared Jewel. The final battle starts as all of the characters fight to end, to stop Naraku. Well, its very good, like the first part of the anime. However, there are FILLERS.The fillers are mostly filler characters, not episodes. The filler characters, are boring. Still, the main storyline is very enjoyable and is great.(plenty of action).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters9/10-All the characters are back, and are all enjoyable. InuYasha, Kikyo, Koga, Sango, Kagura, all my favorite characters. All the characters have matured, and they are all very strong. The romance between the characters are amazing too. Everything is good, well the FILLER CHARACTERS ARE SO BORING. If they werent boring, then this would get a 10. InuYasha the Final Act has great characters, but the fillers ruined it.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack10/10-BEST PART OF INUYASHA THE FINAL ACT. The soundtrack is amazing. The best part is the sad music. Its beautiful. The battle music is very enjoyable too.  The opening theme song is great, amazing. The music is the same from InuYasha, but its still a great OST.\\n\\n\r\nArt9/10-The art is great. The way it looks is perfect. But, I DO NOT like Kagome's new look. She always had black hair. I dont like her new blue hair. But the art is still good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment9/10-Yeah, I enjoyed InuYasha the final act. Everything was amazing. The characters are so griping and the soundtrack has one of the most enjoyable soundtracks ever! The enjoyment from the dub wasnt very high(I dont watch dubs). I watched the dub because I watch InuYasha in dub but this one sucks. But the enjoyment is very high.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall9/10-InuYasha the Final Act is great. I enjoyed it a lot. Tons of action, great music, humor, pretty colos, InuYasha the Final Act is a great anime. A must watch.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nInheriting the story from the original anime (Inuyasha), this story continues on the path of where it left off. At first, i felt the story might have been rushed, this is because of the slow pace of the first anime. However, after the third episode, I realized this was the best. The old anime took it's time and added a lot of unnecessary fillers, which made the show less appealing to most. However, a young kid I loved it, saw the charm in it. I watched every single episode, now at the age of 17, I re-watched it and went on to the one wehave now. Inuyasha final act improves on what the original struggled with and has became a masterpiece! I couldn't be more satisfied with the it.\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nAlso inheriting the amazing art from it's predecessor, Inuyasha final act has some of the best art of any anime, and it has improved it's graphics from it's ancestor as well. All the demons, half demons, humans, souls, trees, and background is amazing. You can tell they were all done well.\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIn the first one, the sound was a little fuzzy! But this one has improved, I think it's because of the change of technology over time.\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nInuyasha final act (and inuyasha) has some of the best characters I have ever seen in a anime. However, since it sacrificed it's slower pace for a much more story driven plot, it doesn't really give the new characters time to develop. No one really knows much about the new characters. This is a fetal flaw, but one that might have been necessary for quickly ending on a satisfying note.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nA 10 without a doubt! Like I said before, it did confuse me at first, but that was only because i was use to the older style, where the story was painfully slow at times. However, I feel that it was necessary to speed it up and get to the main plot points. There are twenty episodes, which all add things to the story that would have been dragged out and covered in fillers, if it had been the same pace as the first.\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThe only problem I had with it, was the character development. And because there was characters introduced that i really wanted to know more about (Sesshomaru's Mother{No name?}, Byakuya, Mouryoumaru, Magatsuhi), i don't feel right with giving it a perfect score. It is a legendary anime and a damn good one...but...I need to give a 9 or I would feel like my attachment to the series got the better of me.",

Even the ones that don`t develop the story are well positioned to make us breath a bit, if you know what I mean. \\n\r\nAnd all was well until the final that spoiled a bit for me. I was expecting better for the final, it was not an absolute desilusion but I did expected better and [spoiler alert]What.was.that.kiss? Totally out of the blue, I know this is not a shoujo anime but even so...[end of spoiler]\\n\r\nIt was not just that that spoiled the ending, it was the ending itself that was not so good as I was expecting. \\n\r\nBut, even so, the story is a 7. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is 9 for me! They improved since the first season, characters got more tridimensional in a good way. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound continues a 8,5 for me also.\\n\r\nThe openings and endings are even more memorable than in the first season, I still have the song \"With You\" from AAA and the \"Diamond\" on my ipod. \\n\r\nIn contrast I don`t remember the soundtrack, maybe it was not so memorable like the first one? But sure wasn`t horrible, or I would remember it being bad. \\n\r\nI think I concentrated to much on the story, ups... sorry? \\n\\n\r\nUp from 6,5 to 7,5 on the characters level. \\n\r\nI ended up loving characters that I didn`t before like Kikyou, Kanna or Kagura.\\n\r\nThe characters were less undecised than before, maybe because the rytm of the story also changed to fast. \\n\r\nBut no, I still don`t like Naraku as a villain. I can`t even hate him, he is too rat to be the main villain. As I said... not a fail, but not a memorable villain.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is still a 8. I was so amused by this season as I was by the first one. \\n\\n\r\nSorry if this review is short, I already made one on the first season and said too many things that it would be kinda useless repeat here. \\n\\n\r\nTotal score: 8\\n\\n\r\nIn comparation with the first season: 7,6 ---> 8\\n\\n\r\nThis season is overall better \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

However, in saying that if you're new to InuYasha it would be best to watch the original series first. \r\nThisanime has a habit of making me sit and watch it for hours on end. I really loved it. The story line has plenty of super-naturalness to it, demons, half demons, spiritual powers and time travel plays a big part in this too. However in saying that, it may come across as a bit of an annoyance to people who don't like it when characters get an \"all of a sudden\" surge of power after seeing the love of their life in danger and things like that.\\n\\n\r\nI quite like the characters, though Kagome can come across as a bit of a wimpy and reliant character, but I think that she plays a very important part and you know what I don't mind that much, though it does frustrate me from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nI love the style of art, big eyes and pointy chins. And the sound, people often tell me that it's better to watch anime in subs rather than dubs because the characters sound better but I didn't mind so much in this, I feel the voices were good for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I loved this, really, really enjoying.\\n\\n",

            "content": "So here I am, in 2015, writing a review for the second and final season of the anime that was my entire childhood.\r\nI was introduced to Inuyasha by my friend when I was in elementary school (year 4) on Animax. I used to watch other things on Animax, but I had never watched Inuyasha and had merely passed it off as \"meh, i don't think I'll like it\" until she persuaded me to watch it.\r\nHow wrong a half-assed judgement can be.\r\nI started watching it and I wasn't able to stop. Inuyasha filled all my days and nights and it was the only thing I couldthink about. I even forged a makeshift tetsusaiga from thermocol and waved it around in front of the TV. I was entirely in love with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, now let me get to the point. Kanketsu-Hen has the reviews it deserves (it is absolutely brilliant!), but there are people who won't watch it because of how the first season turned out. Okay, now, in the first season's defense - the manga was still going on at that time (beyond a whopping 300+ chapters at that!) so I don't blame the studio for going entirely off-track and feeding the TV slot times with fillers, fillers and more fillers. Eventually it was dropped with a disappointing end (understatement) and we waited and waited and waited for a conclusive ending.\\n\\n\r\nAnd years later, determined not to be forgotten, Kanketsu-Hen began its airing on TV. And jesus-f*cking christ, was it GOOD!\\n\\n\r\nI won't elaborate on Kanketsu-hen too much here, but I have a few words I'd like to say on why this anime is different from what you'll think it is just by looking at it. Here goes.\\n\\n\r\nA few episodes of Inuyasha will give people the idea that the show has no depth. A hot tempered half-demon, a selfless and kind main heroine from another era, a gang of quirky characters, lots of evil villains, and the \"REVENGE!\" theme surrounding the entire plot in yellow ticker tape... yeah, it sounds so cliche, and average.\\n\\n\r\nWRONG.\\n\\n\r\nIf you really watch Inuyasha, you'll realize that there is in fact, a LOT of depth to the series. The characters have real feelings, real worries and real emotions. Love is portrayed in all its complexity - just like how love is. There's no black and white throughout, plenty of patches of grey are present. The show is as real as a show can ever be.\\n\\n\r\nMindless fights and lots of unnecessary repeated fight scenes, not to mention the fillers that dragged the show to the end of the cliff in season 1, these are some of the reasons that push people away from watching the final season. \\n\\n\r\nHere's my advice to you. Give Kanketsu hen a chance. You lose nothing.\\n\r\nI assure you that you'll be mind blown.\\n\\n\r\nAh one point before I end. The music. I cannot finish this review without mentioning the music. As i already have a weakness for feudal era Japan (started by.... yes, Inuyasha xD) the music, i found, was priceless. And I mean the soundtrack of the anime, built in through the scenes. Kaoru Wada is a genius.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI'm 19 years old today, I've spent my entire childhood watching this amazing series, and again this year on repeat, and there is no feeling similar to the one I get when I listen to Soutanshi.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this review.\\n\r\n^^/",

It looks and sounds wonderful.\r\n(No Spoilers, so chill)\r\nThis series wraps up the story and holds the big conclusion that we've all been waiting for. And lemme just say, it is executed beautifully. There is no way it could have ended better. I was biting my nails up to the final episode.\r\nFantastic simply fantastic. \r\nThis is definitely one of those animes that I will be wanting tore-watch up until my death bed, and even then I'm sure Jesus probably already has this whole series on Blue-ray. \\n",

I've always loved the show ever since it used to be a thing on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim segment back in the early 2000's.\r\nI believe most will agree with me that this final season, which many were waiting for for a long time after the first anime had ended, was the best! Everything was straight to the point. There was no beating around the bush, the story progressed at a better pace. You felt hate, you felt pity, anger, sadness, love and understanding in only 26 episodes. \r\nTheart was AWESOME! Especially since it was created during the time when the quality of TV shows had been bumped up due to BluRay and higher definition televisions. I could watch this entire last season in full screen without any distortion or pixelation! \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime and it's wonderful emotional journey from start to finish! InuYasha is clearly one of my all time favorite animes!\\n\\n\r\nI gave the first InuYasha a 10/10.. I wish I could give this an 11",

So you can imagine how happy i was when i saw that they made a final season :)\r\nI try to keep it short so you don't get bored reading this review.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story begins where the last season ended. Inuyasha, Kagome, Mirokou, Sango and Shippo are on there journey with their final goal - defeat Naraku.So you can guess the main focus of this season is the fighting between Inuyasha and Naraku. Of course there are also some sidestoryswhich are at least as interesting as the main story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt's at least as good as in the previous season.I found myself sometimes looking at the background and not only at the characters because it looked very nice. Also Inuyashas sword Tesaiga(did i wrote it right?) lookes just awesome. Especially when he gains new Abilitys with it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening \"kimi ga inai mirai\" from Do as inifinty is nice and the endings where also just awesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOf course there are the precious ones like Sango, Naraku and who would have though, Inuyasha and Kagome. But there are also some knew and important character(If you want to know watch it).\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Inuyasha - kanketsu-hen is just the perfect ending of an amazing series. I have nothing to complain about this anime.I hope this helped you to get some information about Kanketsu hen:)",

I know i'm very late with watching Kanketsu-hen and its because i wanted to watch it in english dub. So i waited for the whole series to be dubbed first before watching it. Of course I am not surprised how amazing this series was!! It really tied up the loose ends that the first Inuyasha series didnt. The original Inuyasha had a lot of fillers and the ending was a cliff hanger, however Kanketsu-hen was straight to the point and it wasted no time to wrap the storyup. The characters are pretty much the same which was great!!Although Kagome new eng voice is odd , and you'll see in this series that Sesshomaru talks alot other than that all the other characters are the same. The art pretty much matched up with how the original Inuyasha series ended, it was fresh and new. The story was very enjoyable i gurantee that you'll laugh, cry, smile, everything. If your a true Inuyasha fan than you will truly enjoy this series it will leave u satisfied :)",

Sure the Inu Yasha fillers were sometimes enjoyable for a little break from the action, but it's nice to see a series where something goes on each episode that is story changing. The story is basic. It is the same as InuYasha: Kill Naraku, complete jewel. Simple, right? In a way, I suppose. Knowing InuYasha, there are many plot turns that come along with the seemingly simple story. The sound brought me back six years when i first began watching this show. It was raw and what I was usedto. I was glad to see Inu-sound keep true to itself. \\n\r\nThe characters we all know well. We either love them, or we hate them or we really didn't touch base with an opinion on them. I can tell you one thing, my opinions of some of the characters changed throughout the show. People who I loathed, I began to love, and visa verse. The overall enjoyment of this anime was off the walls and filled with suspense. I can honestly say I cried more than once during this season for multiple reasons. There were downright sad parts, and then there were downright joyful parts that I couldn't help but cry in. If you followed this anime straight from the beginning, believe me you, it's a tearjerker in Kenketsu-hen. \\n\r\nbut it also sticks to it's true nature of the fun, lovable moments that make you replay the moment because it was so fresh. \\n\\n\r\nFinal note: If you watched InuYasha straight from the beginning and was very disappointed by the ending of the 'InuYasha' series, Kenketsu-hen will get you right back on the bandwagon. \\n\\n\r\nBelieve me, it's the same as it was back then.

            "content": "I was never the biggest inuyasha, fan and thought the original work was too slowly paced, full of filler and had characters that were defined by their flaws rather than their whole personality. Of course, at it's base the characters were still likeable and the technical elements were fantastic.\r\nFortunately, the art and music are still awesome. The music consists of a nice mix of stirring western symphonic parts melded with traditional Japanese music. The art is some of the best I've seen recently, and it's a blend of great character designs and backgrounds that flow seamlessly with stunning CG. Rest assured, every battle scene isdazzling.\\n\\n\r\nFor the plot, in general it fixes it's problem of having slow pacing and too much filler. There is only really one filler episode, and it's out of the way early and generally entertaining, though it only starts out as an above average shounen with the first part being skirmishes, power up arcs and resolution of subplots. It was however nice, to see miroku, sango and even shippo get a few last minute upgrades so they can do more than just comment in battles. Speaking of the battles, they range from entertaining in the beginning to awesome in the latter half. They're kinetic, fast paced and exciting and are never dragged on too long and the great art and CG help out too.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest strength in inuyasha was it's likeable characters, and weirdly they seem to come into their own more here than in the previous series. They stop being defined by flaws and work those flaws into just part of their personality. Inuyasha is no longer overly abrasive, miroku doesn't just feel up women and trick people anymore, sessomaru isn't just an obstacle for inuyasha, and most importantly naraku get's the biggest improvement. Before he never seemed menacing to me but rather protected by plot armor. Here, he is cunning and truly evil, and we even get a few looks into his motives in this series. The romances between sango and miroku and Inuyasha accelerate and never slow down, and with a combination of this and the fast moving, almost intricate plot the last half of the anime grabbed me by the heart and the neck and didn't let go. I found myself deeply involved with characters I previously only liked but then loved. This is really a great ending to the series, fans of the original you should be watching this now, and critics of the original this definitely warrants Inuyasha a second chance.",

This season will put an end to the debate of Kikyo/Inu-Yasha or Kagome/Inu-Yasha.  You will get the best of both worlds in the end.  Watch it! Watch the wholeseries plus the movies. It's great!

It is a fantastic ending series to a wonderful anime. In it, Miroku, Kagome, Shippo, Sango, Kirara, and InuYasha are still on their way to collecting the final pieces of the sacred jewel, and defeating Naraku on the way. Still, the main villian grows stronger and stronger as time passes. Koga, Kaede, Kagome's friends and family from her own time era, etc., are all brought backto the show as well for fillers and in general. Strange alliances are formed, unexpected lives are lost, and I cried at least three times. I do have to say that I'm a little upset over the replacement voice actor for Sesshomaru and voice actress for Kagome in the English dub that started in May of 2010. Although I'm not sure how it will turn out without the origingal actors, I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt, and hope that it's not to different. Prepare for awesomness as InuYasha and his friends take the screen one last time!",
