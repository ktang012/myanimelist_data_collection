            "content": "Note: Tl;dr at the end for the lazy ones.\r\n*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*\r\nInspired by American superhero comics, Horikoshi Kouhei's Boku no Hero Academia (or 'My Hero Academia' in English) manga started publishing two years ago, but got gained a lot of popularity only after the release of One Punch Man anime. But being honest here, I must say that I was somewhat disappointed by it.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story is rather childish. In the world of My Hero Academia, on one fine day, out of nowhere, new born babies started having some random super powers which are called 'quirks'. With that, evil villains emerged, and with that heroes emergedtoo, which soon became usual and was accepted by the society. Our main protagonist of the show, Izuku Midoriya, who is always bullied by his childhood friend Bakugou Katsuki who has a great quirk, wanted to join the prestigious 'Hero School', UA, and become the best hero in the world like 'All Might'. But he discovered in his childhood that he is 'quirkless', but finding the potential in him due to various situations, All Might passes on his quirk to him which is somewhat like ultimate strength, speed and endurance. But due to his weak body and lack of practice, he always hurts his body due to the recoil. Anyway, he manages to clear the UA entrance exam and now he must struggle in the school to pass out as a pro hero.\\n\r\nOkay, so far so good. But from this point, the excitement goes downhill. Bad jokes, predictable events, childish plot, and what not, makes it seem more like an American Cartoon than a Japanese Anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nBones Studio, very popular for it's work in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,  delivers some of the best artworks out there. But this time, it gambled with My Hero Academia. The graphics are very sketchy and it feels like we are reading a comic book. It may be a hit for some people. But honestly speaking, it was a miss for me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Porno Graffitti, the most misunderstood band name, did an amazing job for the OP with the song 'The Day'. The fast and catchy song and the visuals along with it are very good and fits the mood. 'Heroes' by Brian the Sun is another great ED. And guess what? Kaji Yuki performed the role of Todoroki Shouto! Also other talented voice actors like Okamoto Nobuhiko, Suwabe Junichi, Kitamura Eri, Yuuki Aoi, Inoue Marina did a great job. The OSTs during the action scenes are really good too. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nThis is the biggest negative point for the show. The characters, are well, lame. Everyone is either silly or one dimensional or simply annoying. They all have unique quirks which make them different from each other. But still, they are lame.\\n\r\nBakugou Katsuki is the lamest and the most annoying of all the characters. He exists just to bully Midoriya Izuku to make the anime more shounenish. \\n\r\nMidoriya Izuku is no good either. A lame-ass who usually cries over stupid things instead of fighting like a man. He is a fan boy who cries tears of happiness like a girl when he is able to see some pro hero. That's seriously lame. \\n\r\nAll Might, the strongest hero in the world is the silliest childhood-hero like character. He has got some weird hairstyle and dialogues without any punch. He has one alternate form in which he shrinks to a thinner size with a gunny un-proportional face and body, which may have been shown for comedy, but I found it silly. \\n\r\nEraser Head is the only character whom I found interesting and mature. Reminded me of Kakashi Hatake from Naruto. :P\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed the show only in some parts of it (mostly the action part). The rest of the show was silly, childish, predictable and it felt like it was targeted for pre-teens. But anyway, if you have already watched a lot of good anime, then this anime is suited for casual watching.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.2/10\\n\r\nIf you are a pre-teen or younger, you will like or maybe love this show. It has all the scenes and factors which today's generation kids love (I guess). If you are a matured adult who is not into silly comedy, bullied-kid-turned-into-superhero or someone who finds funny villains evil, you should probably avoid this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr:\\n\\n\r\n+Sound\\n\r\n+A few action scenes\\n\r\n+Good for audience below the age of 16 years\\n\\n\r\n-Poor plot, many loopholes\\n\r\n-Silly and annoying comedy\\n\r\n-Silly and annoying characters\\n\r\n-Comic book sketch-like art\\n\r\n-Not good for mature audience\\n\\n\r\nIt's like a rip off of Marvel, DC and One Punch Man. But a bad one. Good for casual watching, if you have already watched a lot of good anime and have nothing new to watch. If you like shounen super power anime, then you will like this anime. I have a feeling that the sequel is going to be better. Let's wait and see.",

            "content": "Boku no Hero Academia is an anime that lives and dies by the conventional. While that could be seen as a negative feature in most scenarios, for a superhero shounen that understands its limitations, it's actually quite refreshing. \r\nBeing satisfied with maintaining a status quo in a medium that constantly pushes the envelope may seem like the wrong direction to take until you come to realize the confines the show is working with. While some shows of this nature tend to sabotage themselves with poor narrative decisions, most are usually knocked off, not by their content, but by their desire for more, despite not havingthe material needed to back it up.\\n\\n\r\nShounen stories by design are meant to facilitate the fundamental building blocks of easily digestible themes. It's for that reason that the main demographic targeted is first and foremost young boys to teens before concerning themselves with any other group. While some titles have successfully escaped this genre's trappings to garner appraisal from a more demanding audience (Fullmetal Alchemist, Hunter X Hunter, etc.), most of it tends to fall apart when they attempt to push beyond the capabilities of its written material (Owari no Seraph, Blue Exorcist, etc.). This isn't to say that a creator shouldn't attempt to do more if they think they're capable of pulling it off, just that knowing what material you have to work with is also key to creating a successful work. You can't exactly create thematically rich content from something that didn't contain it in the first place, but what you can do is make the best product possible with the hand you're dealt.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is where Boku No Hero Academia (My Hero Academia) comes in. It's a shounen story that isn't ashamed about its humble offerings, nor does it display delusions of grandeur for accolades out of its reach. While other content creators are busy navel-gazing, Academia uses that time to create something that's full of whimsy. It's an anime that lives comfortably in its realm of customary standards. And really, isn't that enough? Academia doesn't work because it offers more than other atypical shounen titles, it works because it decides to be the best it can be in its current position that it's given. And what better way to show strength within one's limitations than by having the story revolve around characters that put forth their best effort in the face of adversity.\\n\\n\r\nAcademia tells a story that I'm sure any veteran viewer of anime is familiar with. The classic underdog story; the naive boy growing into his own, the bonds he forms with like-minded individuals, and the life lessons he learns along the way. It's a simple tale, one of perseverance, childish ideals, and believing in oneself. \\n\r\nIzuku \"Deku\" Midoriya is that naive boy, and the object of his admiration is that of All Might: the idealized embodiment of peace and justice. The story chronicles his attempts to become an admirable hero like the one he looks up to, as well as seeing him overcome the obstacles he's bound to face on that uphill battle he's undertaken to get there. \\n\\n\r\nSet in a universe where superpowers manifest itself within 80% of the world's population, becoming a professional hero has become commonplace. These innate abilities that people find themselves with are referred to as \"Quirks.\" Naturally, the 20% that's born without a Quirk is at an inherent disadvantage to the rest of the population. And as you would guess, our protagonist Midoriya is one of these unfortunate people that life handed lemons to. Despite his situation, our protagonist still desperately seeks out the chance to become a hero. But it isn't until a fateful encounter that his dream could become a reality. Fast forward a few months later, and Midoriya finds himself at the gates of one of the most respected schools for heroes in training. And so begins our tale. \\n\\n\r\nThe first thing you'll probably notice about Academia is just how expressive its art and animation is. The show looks like colored panels jumping right off the pages of its manga counterpart. This is further illustrated by the dynamic movement of the characters, instantaneously eye-catching character designs, and an ultra-vibrant color scheme. Studio Bones rolled their sleeves up with this one, delivering a visual spectacle that they're known to be capable of. A firework display of showboating talent that the studio has earned across the many years in the industry. And since they're adapting the material verbatim, none of their infamous plotting issues makes its way into the narrative, making Academia into a cohesive body of work, the likes of which wasn't pulled off by Bones since their adaptation of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. It's the studio at their best, which not only spotlight their talents to others but also helps Academia to shine its brightest. \\n\\n\r\nTo further heighten the visual treat, we're also given a soundtrack composed by Yuuki Hayashi, which was, for the lack of a better term, hype-inducing. Lending his talents to Kiznaiver, Death Parade, and other projects, Hayashi is quickly making a name for himself within the industry and is a talent worth keeping on your radar for future works to come. With veteran Sound Director Masafumi Mima lending his talents to the project, together these two men help shape the auditory section of Academia into what it is. It's a commendable effort that's deserving of the praise received.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just like the presentation of the show, the characters are just as lively, with a broad range of personalities and superpowers to boot, as what should be expected from a show dealing with superheroes. While they're all fairly stereotypical, what they lack in layered character detail, they more than compensated with spunk and attitude. Their eccentricities added to the show's tone and lighthearted nature. They're in no way innovative or new to the genre they're a part of, but they still serve their purpose for the content at hand. \\n\\n\r\nThis extends to our protagonist Midoriya as well. He is your archetypal lead in every way possible. Replacing him with almost any other shounen protagonist would yield very little change. What is interesting about him, however, is the handicap that he's placed under due to outside circumstances. Because of the inherent nature of his power, he is forced to make compromises to avoid extensive injury to himself. Since he spent his entire life taking notes of the anatomy and capabilities of other heroes, he's more astute than his peers. This allows him to plan accordingly, especially under stressful conditions that force him to be quick on his feet. As the show goes on, this analytical prowess of his doesn't go to waste. He brings this talent to each physical encounter he's placed in.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of physical encounters, since our protagonist makes an effort to think tactically in the midst of battle, the skirmishes he gets into are far more entertaining than what would you'd typically expect from superhero brawls. Of course, he's still a kid, so these tactics may not be the most riveting things to see play out, but it still beats seeing senseless bishounen cock-fights that resort to shouting and punching wildly to achieve results. This was also prevalent in other physical altercations throughout the show. Again, while not the most imaginative fights, they were still a cut above the usual offerings. This doesn't mean that hotheaded characters grew a few brain cells all of a sudden, they still acted in a brash manner befitting their personality; but for those that have powers or limitations that needed adjustment, they found ways to innovate whenever it was necessary. \\n\\n\r\nWith the trend of superhero stories becoming ever-present across all storytelling media in the last few years, the marketplace has gotten to a point where it's on the verge of stagnation. For the general populace, that point may not be that prevalent yet, but for those vigilant viewers that recognize the pattern, it's a shit storm just waiting to keel over. Boku no Hero Academia is just another drop in the bucket. Inconsequential. A blip on the radar. But that's also the beauty of it. It's not an anime that hurts the medium, nor is it unwarranted to most that sit down to watch it. It's just an honest-to-god shounen. No gimmicks, no underhanded attempts into duping its viewer to take it any more seriously than it needs to; just a sincere piece of media made for the sole purpose of entertaining, and perhaps even more than that for wide-eyed youths that sit down to view this type of story for the 1st time.\\n\\n\r\nThat sort of honesty in a time where desensitized audiences have grown jaded to what's offered to them might just be the remedy needed. I always want to see the medium push forward, but when a break is necessary, I more than welcome the likes of shows like Academia. It's fuel in the fire to keep going. Easygoing entertainment that I could trust at face value won't give me the runaround. \\n\\n\r\nAcademia is a rare case of where it's good because it's average, and I know that may leave many of you questioning how something could possibly be both, but really, that's the only way to explain this show's predicament. We could commend a show for trying and succeeding at doing more, as one should when a title pushes beyond what's standard fare. But at the same time, there's nothing wrong with appreciating a title that chooses to be good in a way that's not necessarily innovative in the market it's a part of.\\n\r\nThis will be an instance where the score of \"5\" isn't used to insinuate inferior goods, but rather one of accurate assessment of the product at hand. It's a good show for its target demographic, just an average one given its subject matter. Its modesty is endearing. And in a time when titles either over-inflate their worth or uninspiringly follow a check-list for a quick profit, Academia proves that just being yourself is never a bad thing.",

            "content": "Tackling a show in a negative light is usually a very tricky task, and even more so when the show in question happens to have a huge and very outspoken fanbase here on MAL. I'll consider myself to be endangered from the moment I click the submit button for this review, as these people will show no remorse if your opinion happens to be on the more negative side of things. However in this particular instance, I figured that taking the risk may be worth the trouble, seeing as the show in question is very undeserving of the praise it has gotten so far. Bokuno Pico Academia is another run of the mill battle shounen about overpowered teenagers doing overpowered things.  It tries to be slightly different in essence but ultimately crumbles under its own weight.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is set in an alternate universe where 80% of the population have received superpowers (Quirks) and evil is running rampant. To protect society from these villains, numerous heroes have emerged over the recent years in order to make justice triumph and bring peace to the citizens. Our protagonist is Midoriya Izuku, a shy 14 year old boy who's aspirations ever since he was little were to become a hero. Unfortunately for him, he is not a part of the overwhelming majority in the sense that he has no Quirk of his own which is why he is regularly ridiculed and looked down upon by the people around him.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this is put to a stop when he is conveniently placed under the strongest hero of all time, Allmight. After going through a harsh training routine for a solid 10 months and gaining a Quirk of his own, he is finally deemed worthy to join the ranks of other overpowered teenagers alike and enroll at the Hero Academy in order to groom his newly-formed power and finally qualify to be a real hero, thus making his dreams a reality. Though that is just the glorified way of saying it. Around here I noticed that the story often struggles with balancing whether or not it wants to handle this plot in a serious manner or a not-so-serious manner, which makes up for some rather rough transitions down the road when the serious arcs role around.\\n\\n\r\nAnyhow, the premise of the story is not the problem I have with it, but rather it's the way they went of doing things. I was personally hoping to see the plot move in a bit more serious fashion or maybe have a bit more focus on the implications and alternation of society as a whole from suddenly receiving these bizarre super powers out of the blue. Though this is a shounen after all, so we ended up taking a more shounen-ish approach to things as we follow Deku and friends through their many trials and tribulations. Unfortunately, when compared to series of the similar nature like last year's One Punch Man, it ends up falling short.\\n\\n\r\nWith other genres to the side, a big portion of time and effort is spent on action and comedy, as you would normally expect from a shounen series. The action scenes are usually handled fairly well due to the bizarre nature of the Quirks and there being basically no limitations to what one can and can't do which in turn makes up for some interesting scenarios. And Bones being Bones, the animation is as consistant as you can imagine. The comedy, on the other hand, is very lackluster and more often than not just ends up falling completely flat. And if it miraculously does somehow end up being even remotely funny, then you can be sure that they will re-use the same joke 5 times over and run it to the ground. A good example of this would be the gag of Allmight being anorexic.\\n\\n\r\nThis section plays a significant role in the series decline as like with most other shounen, the characters aren't developed that well at all. Though, that is not something I should entirely fault it for, especially considering the genre at hand. However, Boku no Hero Academia misses a very crucial opportunity here. Do you know what all the top-tier shounen all have in common? They have an actual likable main cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nThus, we enter Midoriya Izuku, otherwise known simply as Deku. Deku, being the protagonist of the story of course doesn't have a quirk of his own and was therefore looked down upon by his peers throughout his entire life. The amount of victimization they give to this character can get pretty overwhelming at times, seeing as at one point he is laughed at by everyone in his classroom even with the teacher being present and everything. They really went all-out to make this guy the ultimate underdog, to the point where it sometimes just irritates me to watch him. He's weak, can't stand up for himself and is socially awkward around girls. However, this all changes when he conveniently meets up with his favorite and most powerful hero in all of existence and gets taken under his wing. After that, he is fed a piece of hair, thus receiving superpowers. Hooray! \\n\\n\r\nI really thought it couldn't get any worse but here we are. Bakugou Katsuki is Deku's psychopath of a childhood friend, his biggest bully as well as his possible rival later on. He is usually a tool from which Deku's victimization during the series stems from, as Kacchan here is completely mental. It is heavily implied throughout the series by Deku that he became the way he is now after \"straying off the path\" and receiving his Quirk, yet it was clearly shown in multiple flashbacks what an egotistical maniac he was even during his childhood. There really aren't any justifiable factors for this guy. His character is very basic and doesn't ever go beyond him being a self-absorbed cunt who wants to be the best at everything for extremely shallow and selfish reasons. \\n\\n\r\nThen there are some other main characters that didn't leave me much to write about either because they either weren't utilized properly or were just not very good. Allmight is the object of Deku's admiration as well as his questionably-anorexic mentor. He usually ends up defeating the villains in a few seconds and has some semi-inspirational dialogue throughout the series but is ultimately overshadowed for the majority of the show, up until the final 2 episodes. Uraraka is pretty cute and ends up giving Deku panic attacks whenever she talks to him due to his seemingly crippling anxiety around girls. I don't remember the armored guy's name but he's pretty cool. As for the antagonists, their motivations never get explored and we're just left to our imagination.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for Boku no Hero definitely isn't bad by any means, it's just very unappealing so to say. With a very cartoonish style to it, it has a sort of unique feel to it, yet still somehow looks ugly. This complaint is nearly nonexistent when it comes to the backgrounds but is very much there when I stare at the character designs for too long. Midoriya's design faintly reminds me of diarrhea, for one reason or another. Bones has continuously produced some of the best animation through each passing season for years now so no surprise here. Since it heats up during the intense moments of the show the fights are quite nice to watch. Most of the tracks from the OST were unnoticeable apart from the main theme and another track which's timing was nailed very well every time to enhance the feeling of dread once the antagonists showed up. I enjoyed the ending and especially the opening theme a lot and the voice acting was solid, albeit there were some performances that I found to be annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment of the show will mostly depend on how big of a fan of shounen you are. If you go in with the assumption that it will suck, you may be pleasantly surprised like I was when the latter half rolled around. It has deplorable humor which is a miss in 90% of cases which can easily ruin a series for me and that really was the case for the first few episodes, but eventually I just tried looking past it. The final 3-4 episodes of the show is where shit hits the fan and I don't remember the last time I was this entertained while watching a seasonal anime. Essentially, if you're a shounen fan looking for some dumb fun you'll probably love it, and if you're coming in with a skeptical mindset then try to look past the first few episodes, as the show gets better the longer it goes on.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I don't think Boku no Hero Academia is that bad of a series. Sure, it has its fair share of problems here and there but what my rating mostly stems from is when I compare it to other series in the same vein, be it a regular shounen or the example that I have previously mentioned which is OPM. It has a story with some potential to be found but a very mediocre and slightly disappointing execution, with every character in the show being either extremely unlikable and annoying or simply bad. At times it takes itself too seriously and at others not seriously enough, which makes up for some pretty awkward transitioning.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of shounen series, I'd recommend Boku no Hero with a grain of salt as hopefully you don't come in with your previous completed series being FMA and end up setting the bar too high. Though, if you're an easygoing person who's just looking for some dumb fun then this is definitely your go-to this season. All in all, it's not bad and is certainly not good but mainly fails to live up to the hype created by the community.",

            "content": "\"All men are not created equal. This was the reality about society that I learned at a young age of four.\" \r\nThus begins the journey of Izuku \"Deku\" Midoriya, a dreamer, who's passion and wish is to become like his idol and role model, the Symbol of Peace, the one and only All Might. \r\nThere was never a shadow of doubt that My Hero Academia was slated to divide opinions among fans for all the not quite correct-- but inevitable reasons. Enter Izuku Midoriya, a cheerful but an extremely introvert middle school teenager who feels neglected by the society, not because of his depressive tendenciesor anything but that he's a \"Quirkless\" among the more common ones born with \"Quirks\". Quirks are something which has become a norm in the world of My Hero Academia. Nowadays most people born in the planet consist of the 80% of population which mysteriously develop supernatural powers titled as Quirks. Quirks can vary from the personalities to the genetics of the given person, and there is no clear explanation as to how the powers can manifest within a human's body. As quickly as one can comprehend it, this is the way of life portrayed in the series, and it revolves around Izuku, who is now one of those rare cases where there is no sign of a Quirk developing in his body. \\n\\n\r\nFans of the Shounen genre know all too well what to expect from the series. And for it to be coming with an ordinary premise that has been done multiple times within the genre (Which as I said earlier can divide opinions easily.), My Hero Academia certainly has its highs and lows. It gets off to a cheesy start with its nail-bitingly snail-like pace and has a nostalgic feeling to it, albeit the premise gets the better of it and it feels very underwhelming. At this point it doesn't provide sufficient meat to the viewer and it doesn't come off as surprising if the viewer decides to drop the show. While the show picks up on it and precedes it by changing the momentum and present more material to the viewer, the inception of the series leaves a bad aftertaste which cannot be shrugged off. After the initial first four episodes, the series starts to change gears and while it becomes more battle-oriented, it also doesn't leave out the characters that drive it and adds more to them. Once Izuku establishes his very own skill set after registering into the prestigious school of heroes, The Yuuei (U.A.) Academy, things look brighter for him and there's more insight to what creates and identifies him. The mid phases of the series is also where the rivalry of Izuku and his life-long friend and also enemy, Katsuki Bakugo, is at its peak. \\n\\n\r\nIzuku Midoriya takes the center-stage in the show accompanied by All Might, who Izuku thinks of highly and his childhood rival, Katsuki. Izuku is  depicted as a very timid, a slightly eccentric but still a cheerful boy who's one and only wish is to be a hero like his idol. In a matter of thirteen episodes, My Hero Academia manages to flesh out the basic characteristics of Izuku as he tries to overcome bullies who ridicule him on being born without any quirks. The show doesn't shy away from flashing the reality across Izuku time and time again, which gives it a little more meaning to the trials Izuku has to overcome to become like the hero he always admired. Katsuki Bakugo, who Izuku dearly calls as Kacchan, is the exact but a superior opposite to Izuku. From a very early age he is shown as someone who has immense pride in himself. This is only justified more when Katsuki's flashy quirk manifests. The middle stages of the show focuses more on the one-off between Izuku and Katsuki, and excels at presenting Katsuki's extreme pride in himself and him having a superiority complex. All Might can be said to be the most polarized character from the show. What starts as a super hero with generic drawings and whose power is not revealed, leaves a trail of identity behind which makes the viewer slowly draw in towards his charm and ultimately like him towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nI have always been a fan of Studio Bones and their extremely quirky and exaggerated drawing style. My Hero Academia was a case of the two making a perfect couple. Put together with Horikoshi Kosei's Marvel and DC-inspired characters' art style, Studio Bones did what they do best at presenting the honest and fluid animations as they always have. While its a perfect ten on the visual aspect, its also a subject of mere taste. Many are put off by the Americanized character designs and personalities. So in general, its a hit or a miss on the visuals. \\n\\n\r\nGetting to the sound and auditory aspects of the show, the voice acting of the characters plays a big role in conveying the full material to the audience and it was no different with My Hero Academia. Yamashita Daiki's vocals are synced to perfection with Izuku's timid characteristics. He also does an excellent job at being rational and calm while doing the narration as well. Okamoto Nobuhiko's presenation of Katsuki was nothing short of a spectacle in the show. Katsuki's psyched up reactions are handled masterfully by the pumped up and convoluted voice of Nobuhiko. Not to say that Kenta Miyake's job as All Might was any easier. \"There is no need for fear. Why? Because I'm here!\" These lines always burst out the joy within me. \"The Day\" by Porno Graffitti was a perfect choice for the intro and for a classic battle shounen such as My Hero Academia and it will definitely make your blood boil. In a season filled with some amazing openings, The Day without a shred of doubt took the spotlight. \"HEROES\" by Brian the Sun was nothing short of amazing too. It was more centered around Izuku's character and him coming of age. \\n\\n\r\nIf you love shounen anime's, then My Hero Academia will deliver. There is no doubt about that, but its a matter of perspective. It has fights which are more tactically focused and it keeps the audience on the edge of their seats, and has cool characters with some ridiculous powers. My Hero Academia has a wider prospect as a second season is officially announced. The first season is an answer to the potential to be good, and that answer is yes. \\n",

            "content": "Perhaps the next \u201cbig thing\u201d by Shounen Jump. It was inevitable that Boku no Hero Academia (My Hero Academia) would get an anime adaptation. A matter of time and it eventually did. The premise is rather simple and classic for a battle shounen. It takes place in an academy setting with the main character trying to become a hero after being inspired by All Might (his idol hero) and others who vowed to protect their world from villains. Up to this point, there has been all sorts of battle shounen series adapted by Shounen Jump so it was time for superheroes to step up tothe plate.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Izuku Midoriya is a young boy who is born without powers. As such, he is mocked by peers, especially a childhood bully named Bakugo. As evidenced from many flashbacks, he is mocked because of how useless he is while the most of his class all developed powers (or otherwise known as \u201cQuirks\u201d) It goes far to the point where he is even nicked named \u201cDeku\u201d for being useless. Although the initial story establishes Deku as a weakling, this changes after he meets All Might, a superhero who is famous in their world.\\n\\n\r\nA general idea about the show is that Deku is constantly trying to prove himself and to others. Early episodes shows that he is fearlessly loyal to his friends and those he wishes to protect. This also includes Bakugo because Deku always wanted to surpass him after seeing how cool he is. Meanwhile, it\u2019s evident that Deku has potential to become a powerful hero himself. All Might gives him the opportunity by letting Deku borrow his Quirk. After training and determination, Deku establishes himself as a newcomer to keep an eye on while Bakugo grows more jealous of his rival\u2019s abilities. That\u2019s also one of the interesting aspects of the show \u2013 the character relationships. Deku develops many relationships throughout the series. These include the rivalry between himself and Bakugo, the student-master relationship with All Might, and various friendships at school. Through these relationships, we see how Deku brings the best and worst out of characters. And believe me, there\u2019s quite a lot of characters with their colorful personalities in this series.\\n\r\nWith such a large cast, you may be asking yourself \u201chow does the director plan to adapt this show?\u201d Unfortunately, the series is structured to be a 1-cour with a mere 13 episodes. The ongoing manga has over 90 chapters while pacing of the adaptation seems slow. The plus side is that the \u201cslow\u201d also translates to faithfulness as every episode in the series is consistent and leaves nothing important out. As a fan of the manga, I\u2019m proud to say that the series accurately does what it needed to do. I can\u2019t speak for everyone though as the comedy can occasionally feel like a hit or miss for some fans. Although on a subjective level, it\u2019s very popcornish humor that is there for some good fun. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the character casting, the show does a neat job at characterizing most of them. Each of them has a different personality, a different Quirk, and unique persona that makes them individually talented. Some of the more prominent characters such as Iida, Uaraka, Todoroki all get their screen time that will be memorable for fans. In the meantime, it\u2019s important to visualize that each character also has a reason to become a hero. So in retrospect, the characters aren\u2019t there just to push Deku\u2019s story but also have story themselves. The downside is that the characterization is condensed for this adaptation as result of the minimal episode figures.\\n\\n\r\nIt would also seem inevitable that the show is inspired by other genres and shounen jump works. The generic Exam Arc can be easily compared to series such as Naruto or Hunter x Hunter although with different styles. Meanwhile, there\u2019s the whole underdog premise with the main character trying to make a name in their world. Still, the show is definitely fun to watch as it also seems to be inspired by American comic heroes. Popular series in North America such as The Flash, Arrow, etc all have heroes and there\u2019s some resemblance that can be taken to account for this series. All Might stands out as the poster boy, Deku is the most prominent underdog, while Bakugo is portrayed as the hardcore antihero. And of course, we can\u2019t forget about the villains either. In contrast to the heroic resemblance of the good guys, the villains are designed to look malevolent. The show does a nice job at introducing them without shoving them down the audience\u2019s throats. Villains such as Stain and Kurogiri looks legitimately menacing. It also invites the anime only fans to wonder about their intentions, roles, and how powerful they really are. Because really, the show is literally saturated with all sorts of powers. You name it. We got super strength, explosive punches, gravity manipulation, superhuman flight, ice and fire control, invisibility, and even a girl who can use frog-like abilities. For a world with about 80% humans capable of using supernatural powers, it comes with a cool features.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by studio Bones, the show creatively designs its characters that matches a fair amount of consistency. Let\u2019s face it, Kouhei Horikoshi is an underrated mangaka and his previous works weren\u2019t considered major successes. Here, we got this show that has superheroes, action, and it just seems like every shounen fan\u2019s wet dream. The character designs, while looks generic, is also creatively attractive. Every character has their own unique appearance and those who are heroes are equipped with a stylistic costume. I can\u2019t say this enough but if there\u2019s anything to remember this show, Boku no Hero Academia should definitely deserve some sort of reward of \u2018Best Character Designs of the Year\u2019. The action is well choreographed as well when you see punches landing or super powers connecting as how it should. Furthermore, character expressions brings out the best of personalities whether it\u2019s fierce (Bakugo), Charming (Urakara), or heroic (All Might). Deku\u2019s reactions are mostly comedic although when he gets hyped up, there\u2019s a lot to keep an eye on as well. \\n\\n\r\nAh Yuuki Hayashi. I was ecstatic after seeing his name appear as the music director as his work on Haikyuu!! Is nothing short of wonderful. Indeed, the music and soundtrack of the show is a solid demonstration of his talent in this show. It is crisp, intense, and cinematic all the same time. For a battle shounen series like this, it\u2019s important to capture every important scene and the music delivered just that \u2013 making them relevant. The OP and ED theme songs are also creatively crafted with flamboyant choreography and style. Finally, praise should also be given to the voice acting especially for All Might and Bakugo as their character personalities really shines when you listen to their voice. \\n\\n\r\nSo in the end, what should you expect from this show? There\u2019s a lot and if you\u2019re a big fan of battle shounen, then this will be a wonderful treat. From diverse character cast to the high dosage of superhero action, Boku no Hero Academia is a very fun show to watch. Despite my issue with the pacing, it is still consistent on most parts with the manga. With the announcement of the second season, there's still a lot of potential waiting to be explored. All in all, the show is recommendable to anyone. Whether you\u2019re a new viewer getting into anime or a seasonal fan of shounen series, it\u2019s a show that\u2019s nothing short of exciting.\\n",

            "content": "If I were to ask you what you aspired to be, what would be your answer? Everyone lives their life chasing dreams, no matter how big or small. Dreams, goals, aspirations; these elements make up each individuals world and are part of what keeps life unique.\r\nThe dreams we focus on throughout the anime Boku no Hero Academia are those of Izuku; a young boy who aspires to be the greatest hero in a world filled with heroes. This is no menial task, seeing that each man and woman in this world was born with a quirk (superpower) that gives them a clear advantage over youngIzuku who was curiously born without one.\\n\\n\r\nNow, originally I had planned to give this anime a lower score (8 or 9) to try to tend my review to a larger audience. The reason behind this decision was because the show itself was nothing notably different or unique. The story was that of a young man who wanted to be a hero, and who accomplishes such through blood, sweat and tears. In retrospect, it's a story we've seen hundreds of time throughout the years in anime. \\n\\n\r\nNow, take a moment, and peer at the world \"originally.\" I had *planned* to give this show a lower score because I knew some people felt it generic. This is something I had considered around episode 5 - 7. I've now finished the show, and have tossed that idea in the trash and burned it. \\n\\n\r\nThis show, in my honest opinion, is a must watch of the Spring anime season and is well deserving of a 10. The story is indeed something we've seen a multitude of times before, but this show took that story and made it special. I've seen so many zero to hero animes that I never would have imagined watching another that could illicit the emotions this one did in me. This show managed to pull my full attention and to really immerse me in the world it was meant to portray. \\n\\n\r\nI found that by the end of the series I had grown very fond of the protagonist for his die-hard attitude; and had found myself inspired by All Might, the same man who had inspired our protagonist himself. All Might was one of the best representations of a role model character I have seen, he was actually an adult I looked up to in an anime, which is truly something special after all the side character adults I've seen in shows who are simply there to crack a pun every episode or two. To add to this, each character in the show was given a unique personality that didn't fit any prior anime cliches, something I feel is uncommon in this age of anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound work in the show was fantastic. The OST fit the setting and genre of the show, and the OP and ED are both ones I looked forward to listening to each week. The art was well done and I never noticed any 'lazy' frames or glaring mistakes - the animation was smooth and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I really enjoyed watching Boku no Hero Academia. The show felt very much like \"Haikyuu\" in the sense that you wanted to see each character succeed and left the show each week feeling motivated to be the best version of yourself. If you've not already seen this show, then go watch it - if you dropped it because you felt it was generic, I suggest revisiting it; it's well worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nNow get out there and be your own heroes; I'll see you again for Season 2. \\n\r\nPLUS ULTRA\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story 4: My Hero Academia is a story about superheroes learning at an academia. Except it isn't. It starts that way, but it isn't that way. Deku works so hard just to go to a school we don't get to pay attention to. People say it is just a typical shounen, but a typical shounen would have tried to flesh out the school life a little. When you have such a unique school setting for once, you decide to just blow it. It's so stupid. The story is very, very character focused and overly convenient. You go from entrance exams to showing off a reallypowerful set of villains and how the fledgling heroes act in a crisis almost immediately, right when we were just feeling like it would possibly be a more developed world. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9: There are a ton of character designs, which is amazing to me. There are some exceptionally cute character designs, which is not something that I have said about any anime before. It also doesn't shy away from mixing big muscle and a slightly more Western style with the typical skinny young anime heroes aesthetic. There is nothing really lacking, but it isn't artistic enough to warrant a 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8: I don't remember much of the sound, but I have a feeling the soundtrack isn't a weak point. I'm not at all a fan of the opening theme, but the ending isn't too bad. Usually I don't factor in openings or endings into the sound department too much though since they aren't made by the team behind the anime usually.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6: Characters SHOULD be higher, but I still feel like the only ones they really care about are the biggest protagonists. Even with trying to give a lot of characters  a little time to develop, it is done in such unnatural form that it doesn't feel nice. The only exception in this arc was Iida, who really got to show what they were like at heart. All Might is annoying character. While it might seem deep to give such a strong character a weakness, it just feels like an excuse for weak writing and a reason to have a slightly unnecessary tutor character like in Naruto or Reborn!. Yes it may have been the start of the story and a central plot point, but it doesn't work well in the long run and All Might basically just proves that the time limit he placed on himself might mean nothing at all, which makes things feel extra fake. Maybe once the injury is explained, we can understand his reasoning because i don't get why it would hinder him so much.\\n\r\nThe main character Midoriya, nicknamed Deku, is really a solid shounen protagonist since he is truly thoughtful, studious and passionate and gets to where he is at the beginning by pure hard work. But how his power develops is very, very shaky because we don't get to see him train the power directly. His rival is very well presented, has a great character design and you can really feel that he has deeper motivations in everything that will probably develop further even if other developments were dropped.\\n\r\nOne character I absolutely hated was that baby. There is no reason why he exists. His personality is bad and quirk is useless so it doesn't make sense that he got into the Academy with the highest standards. Additionally, Sui's reaction to him is terrible.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3: I was able to watch 26 episodes of Hero Academia, which is more than I can say for basically all of the few anime I get around to trying. But that may have just been because I was curious about the world since I was in an RP discord server and wondering what made the world stand out. Still, I was not excited past the first two episodes. There wasn't too much that caught my attention after they got to the exams and school, except Deku's rivalry and showing off new character skills, which is just too flat for me. There was also the feeling that the plot wasn't properly explored at all by skipping to a major fight so quickly in place of what could have been a very interesting event (learning how to rescue people in natural disasters or something like that).",

Like there are soooo many slightly decent looking girls but i don't see enough fan service which is a major problem when it comes to making animes. Sure I could always go to Rule 34 for that kindof stuff but it just ain't the same as the original source cause the art is always different and wack. All i'm saying is redo the entire series but with WAY more Fan service and I would and lets be honest Everyone would like the show better bcuz right now its pretty trash. I am speaking for everyone when i say this but everyone just pretends its a good show anyways but since no one listens i guess i'm the first to tell the truth. Please share this and hopefully the creators will respond.",

A sentence to summarize this whole show? \"the most overrated cliche shounen anime with ripped off ideas from a marvel movie forcefully jammed together with childish ideals\"\r\nThe story.\r\nI can go on and on about this it was absolutely dreadful and the most cringiest setting I have encountered.\r\nA bland boy suddenly gets superpowers from a hero and starts training and fights for eons.Amazing. It's repetitive like the filler stories of Naruto except it's all squeezed into a season.\\n\\n\r\nThe art.\\n\r\nNot bad really, colors were well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nyeah classic booms and other normal sound effects. The theme songs were nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nCharacters are well dictionary definitions. Please. There's a difference between exaggerated to definition characters. The main character is a textbook example of a one dimensional character with no background other than he was born without powers. \"I wanna be a hero!\" says he but all he ever does is write diary entries about current superheroes and does nothing to even train for it. He gets bullied and never fights back. As a survival instinct  you usually defend yourself to avoid damage and things get cringey. His academic skills aren't special too. Normal. Normal. Normal. Wait, to be fair underdog is a realistic opinion.\\n\r\nHis childhood friend would then be the definition of emo. He hates poor \"does nothing but daydream\" kun and bullies him. I can understand, all he ever did when I watched the episodes was talk about his dreams but still, way too violent.\\n\r\nOthers are poor representations of emotions and ideals like the movie inside out (inside out was good).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: No. Shounen for kids? Yes. Adults? Unless you really like this stuff no. No. No.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Just please no. It's overrated anime that should be called more of a cartoon. I've heard some say this is better than SAO and I really must protest. Yes I know SAO haters hate hate hate because Kirito is bland and his female counterparts are all lovey doves with him and there's tons of other issues like story skipping. I accept that and agree with the constructive criticism. BUT this is the most overrated I repeat overrated anime (ahem cartoon) I have ever seen.",

            "content": "I've come across a few anime of this genre, and I can't rack my brains around how they so consistently amass a large following. Whether the premise is confined to a school; the world; a personal journey; a collective journey; comedy; harem or on a more serious tone. Maybe the recently sensationalised marvel universe has enchanted the masses into submission. \r\nBoku no Hero Academia seems to touch on a few of the above mentioned bases without the core themes being disjointed on paper. The problem however, is that the ultimate relay is a lukewarm exploration into topics it clearly took a more juvenile approach toand ultimately finds its themes disjointed. Which is why I'd  say this is for the younger audience, as I can't imagine this being taken seriously by an older demographic. \\n\\n\r\nBoku no Hero Academia is about a world where 80% of the population is born with quirks, or in other words, some 'super power'. One of the problems I had right away is with the properties of these powers - they were mostly just painfully juvenile and often times lacked any practicality in more or less any scenario. This problem is inevitable if you are going to build a premise of a barrage of characters having said powers. This would have been OKAY if not for the fact that EVERYONE WANTS TO BE A HERO. What's worse, more or less, THEY ARE. To enjoy anime is to often times suspend disbelief, but when you are presented with characters that have lame heroes with powers like climbing walls or shooting balls of goo, it is hard to take seriously. More or less, the majority of other characters also have abilities that any pistol would outdo from a militaristic standpoint. This would have been OKAY if the anime was mostly confined to a comedy genre, but it ISN'T - it tries to take a serious tone with melodramatic and black and white depictions of good and evil.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to the other problem; characters. Alot of characters, but few backgrounds explored. And the ones explored are as what you'd expect if you notice the rest of the show - childish. The MC is a pansy kiss ass without any resolve beyond the shows projected fight for its black and white justice.He always wanted to be a hero despite not being born with a quirk and now conveniently has one, thus fulfilling his dream. That's the sum of his character.  The blonde haired secondary (forget his name), has probably the worst background to date in anime - he hates the MC despite being friends in the past because the MC asked if he was okay after an accident that had nothing to do with the MC, and now this terrible secondary vows vengeance against him throughout the series. One of the worst narratives I've come across. The rest of the characters are also the lame righteous knights without faults for the most part, and as mentioned, don't have much backgrounds explored, and their overall personalities are just a lot of ''I want to be a hero'', to be well, a hero. No backgrounds beyond that for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nThe villains were as you would also expect, the other polar end of the good and evil spectrum. The main antagonist pushes to upset the balance of peace for the sake of destruction and fame. Full stop. Moving on. The only one villain in the show that has any character is 'Hero Killer Stain', whom has an agreeable philosophy to mine - ''there are too many heroes''. The rest of the antagonists seem to just be an extension to the main antagonist with their viewpoints aligned. No individuality to comment on. This union is structurally symmetrical to the hero's society. Bleh. \\n\\n\r\nStory :\\n\\n\r\nThe story is just a function of the above mentioned character design. Light vs Dark. Good vs Evil. Beyond the plot, the combat is mildly enjoyable if you can move past the question of practicality,as it is actually rather well choreographed. Beyond this, the actual concepts of their abilities were a bit too juvenile for my taste. They tried to incorporate a strategic front to the combat, but it was often times a little too simplistic or unreasonable even within their own framework. The absence of death or gore to boot only made the show lack suspense.  Again, no problem with that, but I find it more for a younger audience. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art is one thing I can't criticise at all.\\n\\n\r\n Ultimately, I did manage to get through the show without too much struggle, but it's more of a show to simply pass the time rather than take something with you. Put it on the bucket list if a fun combat oriented anime is for you, but probably place it on the lower end. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "In a world, where all of a sudden humanity has gained superpowers called Quirks\u2026 \r\nA world, in which almost all humans look like alien mutants and the crime rate has significantly increased\u2026 \r\nWhere being a hero is considered a profession and Saitama definitely doesn\u2019t exist\u2026  There exists a boy who belongs to the minority that doesn\u2019t have a superpower... \r\nThe boy, called Izuku Midoriya, has a dream\u2026 He wants to be the mightiest hero of all, he wants to become the second ALL MIGHT!\r\nThe very young protagonist, despite having no Quirk, tries his very best to become one. But is that possible at all,when the profession \u201chero\u201d is all about being strong? And how could one possibly beat superhuman powers if you don\u2019t have a special ability?\\n\\n\\n\r\nBoku no Hero Academia is set in a modern world where every single person wants to become a hero to save the useless people that don\u2019t know what to do with their Quirks from the bad people who use their abilities to wreak havoc and be evil. Being a hero and become the focus of attention is way better than doing mundane things such as becoming a random office worker, right? \\n\r\nThis is where the first problem arises. How can society work if the 80% that have superpowers want to become a hero? And if, on top of that, not having a Quirk is being looked down upon; and doing everything that needs to be done to make everyday life function correctly is disregarded, why would these normal (or maybe abnormal) people even bother? You, the reader, must realize that there is no way the farmers will be able to produce enough food if their population decreases by 80%. Society can simply NOT function in the way this world is presented to us. But hey, since there is a superpower for anything, this might just be miraculously solved!\\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way, I\u2019ll start talking about the main plot. The main character Midorima, in his eagerness to become a hero, takes notes on every hero he sees and looks how they fight against villains. But since he himself has no Quirk, it is very hard for him to become a hero. This is also why many other kids in his class look down on him, making his life more miserable. On top of that, his \u201cchildhood friend\u201d, who is constantly bullying him, makes him realize all the more that it would be an impossible task for a quirkless person. \\n\r\nIt seems like his quest for becoming a hero will certainly fail, when he has a fateful encounter with an emaciated geezer that always coughs up blood. This encounter proves to change his life radically, because Deus ex Machina is overwhelmingly overpowered and seems to be able to solve any problem without much effort. Well, maybe not exactly without much effort, but certainly it is a half-assed way to solve things. This is when he sees a light at the end of the endless darkness. HOPE! He can maybe become a hero!\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe next section I will discuss is characters. Although the cast of character is certainly not huge, being most of them sidekick heroes or unimportant hero students, there are four important characters in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Izuki Midoriya, is a young boy that at the beginning of the show hasn\u2019t entered high school yet. During his whole life he aimed to be a hero, but it seemed as though his Quirk never wanted to appear. Despite that, he continually worked hard to become one through studying alone. He obviously will succeed, as he is the protagonist. That aside, this character seems to evolve slightly, going from a total coward to someone that dares to speak up (a bit). Although he isn\u2019t a total retard, his personality is still the same as most shounen protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nThe second main character, Bakugou, is supposed to be Izuki\u2019s childhood friend, which completely baffled me, as this character is constantly bullying the protagonist bcuz eevil is gud and is objectively superior since he has a nice \u201cbang\u201d. It\u2019s also rather annoying that he underwent a sudden character change; all of a sudden he is a \u201cgood\u201d guy, and the reason to it is rather stupid.\\n\\n\r\nAnother character introduced to us is the emaciated geezer, who is something like a mentor to Midoriya. He is the responsible for making it possible for the protagonist to become a hero and has an interesting story which I won\u2019t tell because spoilers. Nevertheless, I really doubt his choice-making ability, as Midoriya doesn\u2019t seem that special to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe only female lead is a girl called Ochako, whom Izuki met in the hero entrance exam and seems to be nice to Izuki, without any reason. She is a dimensionless character who doesn\u2019t really add anything to the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThus concludes the characters section and starts another one; sound and animation.\\n\r\n\tAs for the sound, the music played throughout the different scenes was satisfying; there was no mismatch between music and type of scene. The used soundtracks were well used and could be considered good. Furthermore, the voice actors played their role well and managed to match the personalities of the characters with their voices. The opening and ending themes were shit as with nearly all shows, and nothing anyone says can change this particular opinion of mine. Overall nothing special in this regard, only what is required to not make it disturbing.\\n\r\n\tThe animation used in this show was good enough; background was well done (though it had no movement) and the moving parts were drawn well. Battle animations were fluid and special effects also transmitted all the information that was needed easily observe what is happening.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I\u2019ll discuss enjoyment and make a small summary of the show.\\n\r\n\tSurprisingly, this show managed to be enjoyable for me, for about 3 episodes. This is where the whole idea started to become too stereotypical and predictable, making me start to dislike it. As the show progressed, everything became more and more predictable; and thus more boring. All the Deus ex Machina didn\u2019t really help my enjoyment of the show either, contributing to the low score I gave to this section.\\n\\n\r\n\tIn essence, heroes are gud and villains are bad; small children must go into a hero academia to beat eevil. Even though there are some terrible people amongst these heroes. \\n\r\nDo I recommend Boku no Hero Academia? No, I don\u2019t think watching this is worth the time for people who actually think about what is happening in an anime while watching, because the amount of plot holes and inconsistencies is too big. For those who prefer to just enjoy a show and not think about it (or those that are new to anime), I do believe that it is worth watching, though.\\n\\n\r\nIf you read through all of this, I applaud you. Furthermore I would like to add that feedback is appreciated.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Boku no hero is one of the most overrated shounens today. And the reason is simple: It's easy to digest, it's generic, full of stereotypes, full of things that make an anime sell.\r\nStory: Is there history in this in the first place? Hardly a story, the story is simply shitty with nothing special. This is one of those completely generic stories of super heroes / battle shounen. Well the premise follows from deku a teenage boy who suffers discrimination and bully for not having superpowers. And now? How will he handle it? Are you going to give an equivalent exchange for that? Will you followyour journey without superpowers and many defects? Of course not, because in the third episode he already gets his super power. The most offensive is that the series creates so much melodrama in its first two episodes, you wonder; What was the point of these first episodes? Why so much melodrama?\\n\r\nIt completely contradicts his story and the whole message he wanted to pass. What a terrible message, and what terrible writing. The premise of this anime is so poorly executed that it makes it subtle naruto. Naruto was also a boy who suffered discrimination, was a person with many defects, BUT, naruto only contradicts his messages and premise in naruto shippuden. Good and after all these terrible messages and contradictions of boku no hero. History becomes nothing. It does not address any subject, and only sees a generic battle shounen with one-sided black-and-white assholes. The series is so childish and poorly written that the series itself says in his face \"This is the heroes and this is the villains, now ready, battle\"! The world-building is also horrible and meaningless: This is a story where 80% of the population has superpowers, and the world is just like ours. The series should have more seriousness with its construction of the world, should do something more creative, but no, the author is very lazy and prefers to do the most generic thing and the easiest thing to digest the world. I hear people saying that this shounen is very creative. Creative where ?. The series is basically naruto and a copy of a thousand shounens. Pos has a school and in which shounen does not have it? There is a protagonist who suffers discrimination and who is very determined and crying, he tells me, in which shounen does not have it? The protagonist has a rival, history has a tournament, history has some training arcs. In the end, I could cite billions of cliches that this shit has.  The only good thing about this story is that the story is fast paced and fun. It has a lot of action to spend time. But another defect is that the story is full of internal monologues, inutile dialogues and so on. But as I said it all earlier. The story is full of contradictions and stereotypes and bad messages. Just terrible story.\\n\\n\r\nWell, at least this story has good characters? No, it does not. As I said before, the anime is basically a naruto 2.0. The characters are terrible, clich\u00e9s and has no development at all. Deku is the typical protagonist who undergoes discrimination and soon becomes a more and more perfect person who gets everything on his journey, all with extreme ease. The bakugou is a sasuke 2.0, only worse. Completely one-dimensional character. His only characteristic is to be a fucking asshole. And you see, the character does not even have a motivation to be a jerk. It's one of the worst characters I've ever seen, just detestable. And people like this character shit just because it has COOLS powers. There's also a guy named all might, who is a super muscular guy and COOL, his name is all might and trained a boy, does not this remind you of naruto? Of course as I said before, the series is a naruto 2.0. The other characters are shallow, barely important and have no development at all. The only good character is the all might, despite being a plot device, it's a charismatic character, it's cool. Everyone else has no way\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is even good, very good to speak the truth. All the action scenes are very well produced. The design although it seems generic, is not as generic as we think. It looks like a cartoon mix with anime, and all the characters are quite different from one another. There's a certain creativity in character design, it's a pretty cool design.\\n\\n\r\nOverall boku no hero is a lousy anime. Terrible messages, terrible characters, zero creativity, and terrible and convenient story. Their only good aspects are the outer parts. Like ost, animation, character design, all this is very nice and cool for a series of action. And do not tell me that the second season gets better, because it's the same old shit, but even more tedious. And I do not even want to see the third. Enough, impossible to improve.",

            "content": "Overrated, childish, and cliche. Those are the first three words that come to mind when I think of this anime.\r\nThis is the most overrated anime that has came out in the past 5 years. After watching two seasons of this anime, I've come to the conclusion that this anime is absolute garbage with no redeeming qualities. I actually cant believe that people above the age of 15 can be watching this. It's actually crazy...This review might also contain spoilers. I cant fully explain how bad this show is without including spoilers unfortunately. This review will also not only be about season 1.\r\nThis is hands downthe most basic and generic shounen I've ever come across. The story is very stupid and cliche. The story is about a kid that wants to become a professional hero. It cant get anymore generic than that. So almost everyone in the world has quirks but Midoriya apparently doesn't. Ok. He then receives a quirk given to him by all might. That's just lame to be honest. I don't like how he just gets a quirk given to him. I'd rather see him training to get his own quirk. If anyone here is familiar with Black Clover, then you know how Asta got his own powers after training right? Even Black Clover did that better than My Hero Trashademia. How boring and uninteresting is it to see him just getting a power from someone else.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is extremely repetitive. They go to school and have training sessions, random villains attack, fight villains, villains run or get defeated, and that's it. Now sometimes it's a bit different, but for the most part shits exactly the same. Nomus attack, League of Villains attack, it's just the same boring shit. In conclusion, the plot is fucking terrible. The only good thing is that the pacing is fast and I don't have to watch 10 episodes for 1 fight. That's literally the only good thing about this awful anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said earlier, this is the most basic and cliche shounen I've seen in a while. After finishing the first season I just thought, why the fuck are people hyping this up? It's literally the same thing as every other generic battle shounen we've had in the past 20 years. It does nothing different yet I see shounen fanboys everywhere sucking it off for what??\\n\\n\r\nThis anime easily has one of the worst cast of characters I've ever seen. The mangaka just tries to give ALL of them screen time it just doesn't work. In the end, barely any of them get character development at all. They're so bad I barely can even remember their names, even after two seasons of watching it. There's nothing interesting about the main characters either. There's nothing interesting about Bakugo. I don't know how anyone can like a character that screams 24/7 and gets absolutely no character development whatsoever. Midoriya has to be one of the most boring characters I've seen in a Shounen. His character development is just basic shounen character development. One second he's a pussy and the next he's extremely serious. It just makes no sense. As for Todoroki he's just a garbage Zuko rip off (but zukos actually a good character) with daddy issues. As I said before, this anime is extremely cliche and bad characters like this just prove it.\\n\\n\r\nThere's just too many irrelevant characters that get screen time for no reason. The only students that need a lot of screentime would be Midoriya, Bakugo, Uraraka, Momo, Frog, and Tokoyami. All these other characters shouldn't be getting screen time when they have little to none impact on the plot. If anyone here is familiar with Gundam Iron Blooded Orphans, use that as an example. The writers for that anime tried to give too many characters screen time and it turned out to be a complete failure filled with underdeveloped characters. The same thing is happening with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has the worst character designs I've seen in a Shounen. I honestly could not stand looking at these people. These characters just look so damn goofy and childish I felt like I was watching a childrens cartoon. Mineta, Alien looking girl, dude with the tape quirk. There's just way too many goofy looking characters to name them all. That's why this is the most childish anime I've ever watched. Not even joking. I've never seen an anime that looked goofier and more childish than this.\\n\\n\r\nThe music wasn't that great either. The only good opening is the first one. The endings are all pretty bad. There was only one memorable OST which played during fight scenes, and that got annoying real quick.\\n\\n\r\nOne good thing about this show is Stain. I think he's the only good villain in this entire show, all three seasons. But besides Stain, every other villain is complete and utter garbage! They're literally all just evil for the sake of being evil, especially that muscular guy. There's just no other interesting villains in My Hero Academia and that's fact. \\n\\n\r\nThe fights in this anime are very underwhelming. All might vs One for All, one of the most disappointing fights I've seen in a shounen. Why should I care about this trash villain One for All when he has no depth whatsoever? He was just used to make all might look badass before his career as a hero ended. Todoroki vs Midoriya, once again another bad fight. The only good part of this fight was the end, that's it. Everything before that wasn't good at all. All the animation was put into the ending of the fight and anything before that was just talking or just boring to watch in general. Uraraka vs Bakugo, a fight that many My Hero fans were sucking off around the time it came out. I... I don't understand why people think this is that good? When it comes to actual fighting/choreography My Hero Academia fights are complete trash. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this show is just awful and I don't suggest watching it. It's no different than any other generic battle Shounen anime you've watched. Bad characters, bad fights, bad plot, bad character designs, bad villains, bad everything. Don't watch this show.\\n\\n",

            "content": "A good anime for doing homework or while at work or doing literally anything productive because I don't know how anyone can sit around and watch this while not multitasking. \r\nYou really only need to pay attention to 1/16th of the show to know what's going on. the rest is fluff. \r\nI guess this is my spoiler line but who on this god forsaken earth hasn't watched  this show by now I'm so sick of seeing it so that's why I even bothered. Usually not the case but everyone says it gets better. does it? does it really? \r\nno.\r\nStory: Typical. Done before. Pathetic uselesskid saves the world. not this season, but it's going to happen it's so predictable. \\n\\n\r\nArt: I'm okay with the art I guess, I really hate their eyes. I mean I can't draw worth shit so what do I know? But someone popped some cue balls in their eye sockets and drew pupils on them. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I'm giving it a high rating because the dub isn't terrible. Re: multitask so my spine doesn't slide out of my body from boredom. Re: I don't speak Japanese. I can't stand most dubs, so props for finding voice actors that aren't 100% unbearable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: dear god. deku is the most annoying piece of garbage. I'm whiny and awful and bully people who don't want to be around me in the name of being disgustingly nice! I hope he dies. IcyHot fills in for 'bad boy v.2' because you need that tortured soul tragic backstory bad boy. Kacchan is really the only worthwhile character and even he is pretty awful. He's mean and isn't trying to be something he isn't. he's 100% his original self. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I longed for my dentist's chair. I would rather be getting told how I need to floss more while they make me bleed than watch this anime again. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: It's childish and unoriginal. I would have loved to see the impact of everyone having these crazy powers, like the world being thrown into chaos even for a little bit? Like that had to happen. The change didn't even happen THAT long ago but everyone accepts it as normal. WHY did everyone even get these powers. I guess if you are a child you might like it. Good for some good background noise while doing finances. \\n",

            "content": "For the spring 2016 Anime lineup, Boku no Hero Academia was considered as the main shounen title of the season, and for good reason. It had everything going for it that you\u2019d need in a good shounen and was something that could easily be picked up by anyone at any time. But the real thing to consider here is, even though it managed to stand as a good show to watch overall, was it truly able to Go Beyond (Plus Ultra!!) any of what the genre has set as its standard?\r\nStory:\r\nFor the most part, the story doesn\u2019t really have much to talk about. Well, atleast not yet. The show, like most others in the shounen genre seems to be of a rather extensive nature and considering the length of Academia, it\u2019s pretty understandable that they could only give us a small part of the story with just 13 episodes, thus leaving us with a plot that does leave behind a few hints of a deeper subject and some greater events to come but unfortunately also leaves the show in a rather incomplete and unsatisfying note. So we\u2019re not really getting any closure until maybe another season.\\n\\n\r\nBut let\u2019s talk about the actual contents. First off, while the concept is nothing new and has been done several times before, the show still manages to present it in a very \u2018fun\u2019 way. It maintains a very nice atmosphere and is able to carry out events in a manner that is very easy to digest and do not require much thinking to enjoy. While the story doesn\u2019t offer anything all that amazing and is rather linear, it is still enjoyable. One other thing that I particularly liked about the show is that it is very honest with itself. It knows exactly what it is and doesn\u2019t try too hard to be something that it\u2019s not. This way, everything always feels in place and none of the scenarios feel overdone or unfitting.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, even with all that, the show still did feel as if it was constantly missing something, like it just didn\u2019t have enough. Though I did say that I appreciated the fact that it doesn\u2019t try to be something it\u2019s not, it also doesn\u2019t try to ever improve or explore upon the aspects that do relate to it. It feels confined to a certain space which doesn\u2019t leave much room for diversity, thus lacking anything for the viewer to truly look forward to. Simply put, it\u2019s a very simple show with a simple setup.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\\n\r\nAcademia offers a simple and comic-like style of art. It might not have all that much detail, but it does hold a certain charm to it and is pleasing to look at. The character designs are also done nicely, again not much detail and are kept simple but that\u2019s what allows it to fit with the theme to a good extent. The animation did feel a bit clunky at times but was fairly smooth when it needed to be, such as during the action sequences which were always animated well enough.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is one of the better aspects of Academia. I always found the OST to be catchy and it always set the atmosphere for the show really well. Coupled with its style of presentation, it managed to set the mood for certain situations and even got me excited during some of it. The voice acting\u2019s also done well, but still not something I would praise.\\n\r\nThe opening sequence was well presented and did prove to be a good way to start the show, but eventually starts to lose its charm after a few episodes. After about 4 to 5 episodes, I found myself skipping through it at the start of each one..\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters do have some very interesting designs and fun personalities, there\u2019s hardly anything redeemable about any of them. Most characters within the show are very flat, they\u2019re exactly what\u2019s given to you at face value. There\u2019s no depth to them and most of them are very stereotypical. The main character himself follows a very generic underdog personality and development which can pretty much be seen anywhere within the shounen genre. There isn\u2019t anything wrong with sticking to the norm, but to not add your own uniqueness to it kind of is. Because of which, most of the cast just ends up feeling like a copy-paste of other shounen stereotypes. While the characters do have their own quirky personalities and are fun in their own way, they don\u2019t have anything to offer much beyond that, and eventually end up feeling rather plain and forgettable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPresentation:\\n\\n\r\nThis is the aspect which pretty much saves Academia from falling to a bad grade. Despite all the shortcomings, it still manages to be an entertaining show. It just offers a very lively feel and really puts you in the mood. Getting to experience all the different abilities and quirks that the many characters had, proved to be a rather enjoyable experience for me and the way these quirks are used during the battle sequences was also very nice. It gave off a sense of creativity. The way the show carries out its development and how it\u2019s all presented allowed me to enjoy the show for what it offered without paying too much mind to the many problems that it already had. Thus allowing me to even forget about those problems sometimes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion and Verdict:\\n\\n\r\nWhile Academia might not have been able to offer anything above the usual, it still fulfilled its job as a fun shounen. If you\u2019re looking for a nice little show to watch that doesn\u2019t take too much thinking or just want to enjoy something that\u2019s quick while giving out enough enjoyment to make you want to watch more, then Academia could tend to your needs quite well. But for those who\u2019ve already seen enough of the genre and are looking for something new to be had, then your time is better spent elsewhere.",

            "content": "Boku no hero academia or My hero academia was one of the most hyped anime series of spring 2016 and in my opinion it lived up to the hype.\r\nMy biggest disappointment was the episode count being only 13 but that was to be expected as Bones rarely does 25 episode anime. However a season 2 has been announced and if they continue to follow the manga season 2 will be even better.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story is not that original but all the characters quirks make the story interesting enough.\r\nArt: 9/10\r\nThe art and animation for Boku no hero academia is great for the most is great, thereis a few scenes near the end were the animation is not that great but it is very good for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9//10\\n\r\nI love the soundtrack it fit the series perfectly. The opening is fine  but I thought it would be better, the ending theme is great though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters are all unique the only reason it does not get a ten is because their are too many characters and not enough time. The character that were introduced were great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed Boku no hero academia so much it was my favourite of Spring 2016. Not only was it my favourite of Spring 2016 it is only in my top 5 anime of all time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nOverall Boku no hero academia was great. It was slow paced and needed more episodes but I still enjoyed it. Just after the villains arc ( the one the anime ended on) the manga gets way better so I'm very hyped for season 2. I highly recommend My hero academia so everyone. Evan if you thought season 1 was just okay I think you should watch season 2 when I comes out it will be way better.\\n\\n\r\nWatch it on Funimation or buy the blu rays when the come out. Illegally streaming is killing the anime industry. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review, It was my first one so it might not be that great.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "First thing I  just feel the need to say, everyone who is saying this is like One Punch Man... sorry but THAT IS ABSOLUTE BS. Beyond the fact that they're both series with heroes and superpowers and that the character designs are are a little funky/quirky (haha pun intended), there is NOTHING SIMILAR. That's like saying Death Note and Bleach are similar series since they happen to both focus on shinigami as a supernatural element in a previously seemingly normal world and both MC are high schoolers. Bleh. No. Just no. Just needed to get that off my chest, since I feel like peoplemight watch this with the expectation that it's like One Punch Man, or might not watch it because they think it will be like it. It's not.\\n\\n\r\nSince I'm late to the party in watching this, rather than give yet another description of the plot like all the other reviews before mine, I'm just gonna say it straight:\\n\\n\r\nThis show suffers from a SERIOUS pacing issue. Every single episode, from the first to the last, feels like a forth to a half is filler. The story is dragged out beyond being dragged out. It doesn't work because for this first arc of the story, the plot is very simple and predictable and follows a typical shounen genre type plot with magical schools/superpowers we've seen dozens and dozens of times beforehand.\\n\\n\r\nYou can literally fast forward through a lot of it, and the characters will be doing the exact same exercise/dialogue topic/training, whatever, as minutes prior. And it's not complicated stuff, there's no amazing fight scenes or complex plot points to warrant such drawn out scenarios. Basically, it actually gets boring.\\n\\n\r\nI'm being repetitive, but it's just truthful, you can't drag out a show with such a simple story line. I feel like what happened in 13 episodes could have happened easily in half the time, and it still might have felt a little dragged out.\\n\\n\r\nI actually ended up reading the manga after, because I really like the whole superpower/magical school genre, (and it's rare to find one without the females being stupidly cliche weak/annoying idiots or overly sexualized characters only being placed for fan service. Kudos to the author for that.) The manga is bounds and leaps better than the anime, and after reading it I can see WHY people rate this show so highly. If you're a fan of the manga, seeing the characters you like come to life, and knowing the cool storyline that unfolds afterwards, is really awesome and exciting. But as an anime on it's own, if you're not already a fan, it's just alright.\\n\\n\r\nThe show gives off that same feel that Naruto filler episodes do: the creators are trying to milk it for everything it's worth to make as much money as possible. I don't blame them, since it's a business, but it could've been an amazing show. As it is, it's just sort of good. I wouldn't be disappointed if it's discontinued, but I would still be sort of interested to see if it gets better in the next season, giving how well I like the manga. That sort of feel.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up,  to just rate this show based on its merits as a stand alone anime, it barely receives a passing grade.",

            "content": "Seeing the hype of My Hero Academia, I have the general impression that people watch it with the mindset as just another enjoyable fighting shounen with a unique-looking superhero premise. The production values are decent, the atmosphere is fitting for the superhero premise, and the story of a Quirkless individual really gives off that empowerment vibes. However, I like to try to dig beneath the surface. This review is mainly focused on the premise of the show and how it\u2019s possibly flawed upon closer inspection. \r\n\tFirst, we get a setting where having superpowers is a normality. How come heroism still thrives in this kind ofsetting? Factors such as the existence of Quirkless people, powers being inferior to others, and the inevitable division between bad and evil are all reasons why. Yet, these reasons could have been used more properly to have a better story in terms of conflict and exploration. The existence of Quirkless people serves as a way for discrimination to thrive into the story, without having any pre-existing remedies to compensate for their absence of Quirks. Inferior powers are also a way for discrimination to be present in the story, but powers could be used in other aspects of life apart from fighting like industry and transportation. The division between bad and good hasn\u2019t been properly explained by the story so far but the impression I get is that it\u2019s biased on one side (Justice always wins). I\u2019m hoping the second season will try to expand on this aspect. \\n\\n\r\n\tSecond, the story takes place in an academy for aspiring heroes. Does it really need to be necessary to enroll in an academy to be qualified a hero? Apart from the main cast being kids which means there must be a sort of school, there is no real reason. There is an organization of heroes in general but having an academy that is modelled after an ordinary school with stuff like English class feel pointless. Powers varies by person and you can\u2019t simply measure their capability through a set of tests following a common guideline. Sure, you can polish things like preparedness, mentality, and utilization of powers but they mostly lie on the theoretical side. How will they train their powers if there is no such thing as an academy? Things such as self-training or discipleship work.  Based from what I observed, the main drive for the cast is to have their powers recognized by the crowd and not the noble idea of helping others unconditionally like All Might does. The original meaning of heroism gets twisted. It can make an interesting deconstruction but it doesn\u2019t look that way based on what we are shown thus far.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe story is fairly average as a shounen title but with the attention-grabbing superhero premise. The main cast are not really that interesting and lack the charm to be an interesting hero. They could use better characterization to look less generic and more character background to reinforce their standing and future development as a character in the story. Overall, it has an interesting premise but it\u2019s not being fully utilized by the story. It has a strong start, but it starts to lose steam as it side-tracks into the less interesting parts of the story. The enjoyment is there, with a couple of frustrations along the way, but it could have used its episodes better. But hey, we still have another season and just maybe it might resolve some of the problems I have in the show. For now, it\u2019s just fine as a mindless yet enjoyable and engaging superhero story but not really as amazing as I expected it to be.\\n",

            "content": "My Hero Academia was easily the most hyped show this season for me, and for good reason. Once I heard that it was going to be produced by Bones, my anticipation went through the roof because of the obligatory Full Metal Alchemist comparisons. What I got was not FMA, nor should it have been. My Hero Academia is an endearing and uplifting tale of a young boy trying to get accepted into an academy full of individuals with superpowers (which he ironically has none of). It's almost like an anime based on Xmen. It ends up suffering a tad from groundhogs day disease and plotconveniences, and the overall premise wasn't exactly what I originally foresaw. However, a great potential and the last three episodes certainly made the series for me, giving me something to look forward to in the newly announced season two.\\n\\n\r\nThere's that popular saying in life that everything is good in moderation, and I found that that's one of the areas that Academia struggles.  The first episode was rather enjoyable and I really felt moved and gripped by Midoriya's motivating personality.  The way he admired the other heroes and envied their ability to save those in need struck some heart chords with me that I really can't explain. A lot of shows start off with this underwhelmingly weak protagonist but something about Midoriya seemed more relatable. In a way he kind of reminded me of myself because of his brains over brawn mentality, even if it is was technically forced upon him due to natural selection. Unfortunately, the \"I can do it!\" theme from the first episode repeated a multitude of times afterwards. It almost felt as though I was watching the same episode over and over again with a different background. This was the point in the show when I realized how lofty my expectations may have initially been.\\n\\n\r\nI chuckled at the convenient nature in which Midoriya receives his perk. I guess in his case persistence really does pay off. All Might almost appeared to be swatting away a fly when he was initially dismissive of Midoriya. Convenience aside, I was relieved to see that the power given to him was not magically mastered in a minute. Perseverance and willpower were the keys to making this perk work. Using this new power Midoriya grows tremendously as a character. Through this growth he even inadvertently manages to spark a sense of jealousy in his rival Kacchan's eyes.  toll that the All Might ability had on his body was proof of its potency. The manner in which Midoriya's fellow students revered him after saving Uraraka was a prime example of the naivety of youth. The other adults teaching the classes knew something was up, but his peers change their minds rather quickly when they saw the impact of his perk. I'm just glad an anime writer finally illustrated how gullible kids can be vice making them into a reincarnated Sherlock Holmes in the form of a 14-year-old. I appreciated the sense of realism written into the characters which was shown quite well in the evacuation scene, where mass chaos ensued when the threat of a security breach within the school loomed.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect of Academia I enjoyed was the comedy. Sometimes anime can entirely derail due to poorly written comedy. Unintentionally deadpan humor that falls on deaf ears can be cringe worthy. There were even shows this season guilty of such atrocities in dialogue. Academia's jokes were well written, subtle and well-placed within its 13 jampacked episodes. I even found myself laughing out loud during a couple of instances. Something about Midoriya's character is so pathetic you can't help but laugh at him from time to time.  At the same token, the story can have very uplifting moments, and the tides can turn quite quickly into serious, cerebral battles. Pacing can be a slight issue due to the development of the characters, environment and plot. With the potential to be a repeating series, at times Academia struggled to keep me focused due to the sheer amount of things it was trying to get done in such a short amount of episodes. Despite this and the aforementioned groundhog effect, Academia kept me entertained and intrigued enough to look forward to its second installment in order to expand the story.  I was also elated to see how the show ended, another aspect that made me look forward to future seasons. The series took a dark turn in the concluding episodes, showing the heroes in a vulnerable state, something not shown in many anime/television shows. You can really feel the panic in Midoriya and his friend's voices, realizing that being a hero isn't all about glory and morality... There can be quite a grim side as well.\\n\\n\r\nObviously the character development in Academia primarily revolves around our main protagonist Midoriya. I can be slightly empathetic to his childhood as I also got made fun of and ridiculed for my shortcomings when I was younger. I do like the approach the writers gave to Midoriya's backstory, making it seem like a tale of redemption more than a sob story. Although meek and timid l, Midoriya shows promise as a MC from his determination and intellect. Although his goals are lofty, he is still just a boy who is shy and nervous around girls, and gets worked up over relatively trivial matters. His interactions with Kacchan are very believable in the sense that he sees himself at level ground once his perk is obtained. His rival, someone that he's looked up to and envied for his entire life has now been knocked down a peg and has become vulnerable. The Herculean growth he goes through in the series is awe-inspiring. Kacchan doesn't necessarily receive the same amount of growth or character development, but he isn't entirely ignored. His past is slightly explored through character flashbacks and some inner monolguing, but it didn't quite cut the mustard for me. I wanted to know more about what made his mind works the way it did and why he was always so pissed off at Midoriya. I felt like there was a lot more emotion possibly smokescreened beneath it all. \\n\\n\r\nBesides Kacchan and Midoriya, the only other character worthy of any development was All Might. His facade he showcased in hero form was taking a massive toll on his body.  Passing the torch was inevitable, but he struggled internally with doing so.  I think he may have been my favorite character in the whole series. There was just a brute sense of realism in his actions. I know that this character development problem stems from the fact that the series is only 13 episodes but that doesn't make it not a problem. I know that risk and budgeting issues limit most anime seasons from being longer than about a dozen episodes, but it doesn't give me a real chance to become connected to a cast the size of a show like Academia. I couldn't even remember half of their names when the show is over. I know this isn't a problem directly linked to Academia, but it's frustrating nonetheless. The villain who appeared at the end showed some promise so, I guess I'll have to wait till next season to see his character more developed.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no denying that the music and art in Academia are top notch and I would expect nothing less from bones. The opening is one of my favorites this season, with its quick beat and intense animation. I actually found it on a 10 hour loop within a couple days of its premiere on YouTube. There are no miss use of sound effects or bad voice acting. Both Midoriya and All Might's voice actors put on tremendous shows of versatility in their roles. The ED's a cute little childish bow on each episode as if to remind you that you're watching a cartoon, in case you forgot. Nothing really special here. I really like the art style in academia, everything looked fluid and seamless... and its budget was on display here.  Beautiful fight scenes galore, it was certainly visually stimulating. I thought it was interesting how both shows produced by Bones this season (Academia and Bunguo Stray Dogs) each had such vivid and discernible art styles.\\n\\n\r\nMy Hero Academia was no FMAB reincarnation, but was easily entertaining in its own right.  Through its use of eye-catching visuals and inspirational story, there is something for everyone in this series.  I am anxiously awaiting the second season to discover what happens to Midoriya and his friends at the Hero Academy.  I guess only time will tell how great of a franchise this becomes, but I would recommend it to anyone.  If you're looking for some quality action and entertainment without too much strain on the intellectual side, this is an anime for you.

            "content": "Note: Tl;dr at the end for the lazy ones.\r\n*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*\r\nInspired by American superhero comics, Horikoshi Kouhei's Boku no Hero Academia (or 'My Hero Academia' in English) manga started publishing two years ago, but got gained a lot of popularity only after the release of One Punch Man anime. But being honest here, I must say that I was somewhat disappointed by it.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story is rather childish. In the world of My Hero Academia, on one fine day, out of nowhere, new born babies started having some random super powers which are called 'quirks'. With that, evil villains emerged, and with that heroes emergedtoo, which soon became usual and was accepted by the society. Our main protagonist of the show, Izuku Midoriya, who is always bullied by his childhood friend Bakugou Katsuki who has a great quirk, wanted to join the prestigious 'Hero School', UA, and become the best hero in the world like 'All Might'. But he discovered in his childhood that he is 'quirkless', but finding the potential in him due to various situations, All Might passes on his quirk to him which is somewhat like ultimate strength, speed and endurance. But due to his weak body and lack of practice, he always hurts his body due to the recoil. Anyway, he manages to clear the UA entrance exam and now he must struggle in the school to pass out as a pro hero.\\n\r\nOkay, so far so good. But from this point, the excitement goes downhill. Bad jokes, predictable events, childish plot, and what not, makes it seem more like an American Cartoon than a Japanese Anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nBones Studio, very popular for it's work in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood,  delivers some of the best artworks out there. But this time, it gambled with My Hero Academia. The graphics are very sketchy and it feels like we are reading a comic book. It may be a hit for some people. But honestly speaking, it was a miss for me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Porno Graffitti, the most misunderstood band name, did an amazing job for the OP with the song 'The Day'. The fast and catchy song and the visuals along with it are very good and fits the mood. 'Heroes' by Brian the Sun is another great ED. And guess what? Kaji Yuki performed the role of Todoroki Shouto! Also other talented voice actors like Okamoto Nobuhiko, Suwabe Junichi, Kitamura Eri, Yuuki Aoi, Inoue Marina did a great job. The OSTs during the action scenes are really good too. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nThis is the biggest negative point for the show. The characters, are well, lame. Everyone is either silly or one dimensional or simply annoying. They all have unique quirks which make them different from each other. But still, they are lame.\\n\r\nBakugou Katsuki is the lamest and the most annoying of all the characters. He exists just to bully Midoriya Izuku to make the anime more shounenish. \\n\r\nMidoriya Izuku is no good either. A lame-ass who usually cries over stupid things instead of fighting like a man. He is a fan boy who cries tears of happiness like a girl when he is able to see some pro hero. That's seriously lame. \\n\r\nAll Might, the strongest hero in the world is the silliest childhood-hero like character. He has got some weird hairstyle and dialogues without any punch. He has one alternate form in which he shrinks to a thinner size with a gunny un-proportional face and body, which may have been shown for comedy, but I found it silly. \\n\r\nEraser Head is the only character whom I found interesting and mature. Reminded me of Kakashi Hatake from Naruto. :P\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed the show only in some parts of it (mostly the action part). The rest of the show was silly, childish, predictable and it felt like it was targeted for pre-teens. But anyway, if you have already watched a lot of good anime, then this anime is suited for casual watching.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.2/10\\n\r\nIf you are a pre-teen or younger, you will like or maybe love this show. It has all the scenes and factors which today's generation kids love (I guess). If you are a matured adult who is not into silly comedy, bullied-kid-turned-into-superhero or someone who finds funny villains evil, you should probably avoid this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr:\\n\\n\r\n+Sound\\n\r\n+A few action scenes\\n\r\n+Good for audience below the age of 16 years\\n\\n\r\n-Poor plot, many loopholes\\n\r\n-Silly and annoying comedy\\n\r\n-Silly and annoying characters\\n\r\n-Comic book sketch-like art\\n\r\n-Not good for mature audience\\n\\n\r\nIt's like a rip off of Marvel, DC and One Punch Man. But a bad one. Good for casual watching, if you have already watched a lot of good anime and have nothing new to watch. If you like shounen super power anime, then you will like this anime. I have a feeling that the sequel is going to be better. Let's wait and see.",

            "content": "Boku no Hero Academia is an anime that lives and dies by the conventional. While that could be seen as a negative feature in most scenarios, for a superhero shounen that understands its limitations, it's actually quite refreshing. \r\nBeing satisfied with maintaining a status quo in a medium that constantly pushes the envelope may seem like the wrong direction to take until you come to realize the confines the show is working with. While some shows of this nature tend to sabotage themselves with poor narrative decisions, most are usually knocked off, not by their content, but by their desire for more, despite not havingthe material needed to back it up.\\n\\n\r\nShounen stories by design are meant to facilitate the fundamental building blocks of easily digestible themes. It's for that reason that the main demographic targeted is first and foremost young boys to teens before concerning themselves with any other group. While some titles have successfully escaped this genre's trappings to garner appraisal from a more demanding audience (Fullmetal Alchemist, Hunter X Hunter, etc.), most of it tends to fall apart when they attempt to push beyond the capabilities of its written material (Owari no Seraph, Blue Exorcist, etc.). This isn't to say that a creator shouldn't attempt to do more if they think they're capable of pulling it off, just that knowing what material you have to work with is also key to creating a successful work. You can't exactly create thematically rich content from something that didn't contain it in the first place, but what you can do is make the best product possible with the hand you're dealt.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is where Boku No Hero Academia (My Hero Academia) comes in. It's a shounen story that isn't ashamed about its humble offerings, nor does it display delusions of grandeur for accolades out of its reach. While other content creators are busy navel-gazing, Academia uses that time to create something that's full of whimsy. It's an anime that lives comfortably in its realm of customary standards. And really, isn't that enough? Academia doesn't work because it offers more than other atypical shounen titles, it works because it decides to be the best it can be in its current position that it's given. And what better way to show strength within one's limitations than by having the story revolve around characters that put forth their best effort in the face of adversity.\\n\\n\r\nAcademia tells a story that I'm sure any veteran viewer of anime is familiar with. The classic underdog story; the naive boy growing into his own, the bonds he forms with like-minded individuals, and the life lessons he learns along the way. It's a simple tale, one of perseverance, childish ideals, and believing in oneself. \\n\r\nIzuku \"Deku\" Midoriya is that naive boy, and the object of his admiration is that of All Might: the idealized embodiment of peace and justice. The story chronicles his attempts to become an admirable hero like the one he looks up to, as well as seeing him overcome the obstacles he's bound to face on that uphill battle he's undertaken to get there. \\n\\n\r\nSet in a universe where superpowers manifest itself within 80% of the world's population, becoming a professional hero has become commonplace. These innate abilities that people find themselves with are referred to as \"Quirks.\" Naturally, the 20% that's born without a Quirk is at an inherent disadvantage to the rest of the population. And as you would guess, our protagonist Midoriya is one of these unfortunate people that life handed lemons to. Despite his situation, our protagonist still desperately seeks out the chance to become a hero. But it isn't until a fateful encounter that his dream could become a reality. Fast forward a few months later, and Midoriya finds himself at the gates of one of the most respected schools for heroes in training. And so begins our tale. \\n\\n\r\nThe first thing you'll probably notice about Academia is just how expressive its art and animation is. The show looks like colored panels jumping right off the pages of its manga counterpart. This is further illustrated by the dynamic movement of the characters, instantaneously eye-catching character designs, and an ultra-vibrant color scheme. Studio Bones rolled their sleeves up with this one, delivering a visual spectacle that they're known to be capable of. A firework display of showboating talent that the studio has earned across the many years in the industry. And since they're adapting the material verbatim, none of their infamous plotting issues makes its way into the narrative, making Academia into a cohesive body of work, the likes of which wasn't pulled off by Bones since their adaptation of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. It's the studio at their best, which not only spotlight their talents to others but also helps Academia to shine its brightest. \\n\\n\r\nTo further heighten the visual treat, we're also given a soundtrack composed by Yuuki Hayashi, which was, for the lack of a better term, hype-inducing. Lending his talents to Kiznaiver, Death Parade, and other projects, Hayashi is quickly making a name for himself within the industry and is a talent worth keeping on your radar for future works to come. With veteran Sound Director Masafumi Mima lending his talents to the project, together these two men help shape the auditory section of Academia into what it is. It's a commendable effort that's deserving of the praise received.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just like the presentation of the show, the characters are just as lively, with a broad range of personalities and superpowers to boot, as what should be expected from a show dealing with superheroes. While they're all fairly stereotypical, what they lack in layered character detail, they more than compensated with spunk and attitude. Their eccentricities added to the show's tone and lighthearted nature. They're in no way innovative or new to the genre they're a part of, but they still serve their purpose for the content at hand. \\n\\n\r\nThis extends to our protagonist Midoriya as well. He is your archetypal lead in every way possible. Replacing him with almost any other shounen protagonist would yield very little change. What is interesting about him, however, is the handicap that he's placed under due to outside circumstances. Because of the inherent nature of his power, he is forced to make compromises to avoid extensive injury to himself. Since he spent his entire life taking notes of the anatomy and capabilities of other heroes, he's more astute than his peers. This allows him to plan accordingly, especially under stressful conditions that force him to be quick on his feet. As the show goes on, this analytical prowess of his doesn't go to waste. He brings this talent to each physical encounter he's placed in.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of physical encounters, since our protagonist makes an effort to think tactically in the midst of battle, the skirmishes he gets into are far more entertaining than what would you'd typically expect from superhero brawls. Of course, he's still a kid, so these tactics may not be the most riveting things to see play out, but it still beats seeing senseless bishounen cock-fights that resort to shouting and punching wildly to achieve results. This was also prevalent in other physical altercations throughout the show. Again, while not the most imaginative fights, they were still a cut above the usual offerings. This doesn't mean that hotheaded characters grew a few brain cells all of a sudden, they still acted in a brash manner befitting their personality; but for those that have powers or limitations that needed adjustment, they found ways to innovate whenever it was necessary. \\n\\n\r\nWith the trend of superhero stories becoming ever-present across all storytelling media in the last few years, the marketplace has gotten to a point where it's on the verge of stagnation. For the general populace, that point may not be that prevalent yet, but for those vigilant viewers that recognize the pattern, it's a shit storm just waiting to keel over. Boku no Hero Academia is just another drop in the bucket. Inconsequential. A blip on the radar. But that's also the beauty of it. It's not an anime that hurts the medium, nor is it unwarranted to most that sit down to watch it. It's just an honest-to-god shounen. No gimmicks, no underhanded attempts into duping its viewer to take it any more seriously than it needs to; just a sincere piece of media made for the sole purpose of entertaining, and perhaps even more than that for wide-eyed youths that sit down to view this type of story for the 1st time.\\n\\n\r\nThat sort of honesty in a time where desensitized audiences have grown jaded to what's offered to them might just be the remedy needed. I always want to see the medium push forward, but when a break is necessary, I more than welcome the likes of shows like Academia. It's fuel in the fire to keep going. Easygoing entertainment that I could trust at face value won't give me the runaround. \\n\\n\r\nAcademia is a rare case of where it's good because it's average, and I know that may leave many of you questioning how something could possibly be both, but really, that's the only way to explain this show's predicament. We could commend a show for trying and succeeding at doing more, as one should when a title pushes beyond what's standard fare. But at the same time, there's nothing wrong with appreciating a title that chooses to be good in a way that's not necessarily innovative in the market it's a part of.\\n\r\nThis will be an instance where the score of \"5\" isn't used to insinuate inferior goods, but rather one of accurate assessment of the product at hand. It's a good show for its target demographic, just an average one given its subject matter. Its modesty is endearing. And in a time when titles either over-inflate their worth or uninspiringly follow a check-list for a quick profit, Academia proves that just being yourself is never a bad thing.",

            "content": "Tackling a show in a negative light is usually a very tricky task, and even more so when the show in question happens to have a huge and very outspoken fanbase here on MAL. I'll consider myself to be endangered from the moment I click the submit button for this review, as these people will show no remorse if your opinion happens to be on the more negative side of things. However in this particular instance, I figured that taking the risk may be worth the trouble, seeing as the show in question is very undeserving of the praise it has gotten so far. Bokuno Pico Academia is another run of the mill battle shounen about overpowered teenagers doing overpowered things.  It tries to be slightly different in essence but ultimately crumbles under its own weight.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is set in an alternate universe where 80% of the population have received superpowers (Quirks) and evil is running rampant. To protect society from these villains, numerous heroes have emerged over the recent years in order to make justice triumph and bring peace to the citizens. Our protagonist is Midoriya Izuku, a shy 14 year old boy who's aspirations ever since he was little were to become a hero. Unfortunately for him, he is not a part of the overwhelming majority in the sense that he has no Quirk of his own which is why he is regularly ridiculed and looked down upon by the people around him.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this is put to a stop when he is conveniently placed under the strongest hero of all time, Allmight. After going through a harsh training routine for a solid 10 months and gaining a Quirk of his own, he is finally deemed worthy to join the ranks of other overpowered teenagers alike and enroll at the Hero Academy in order to groom his newly-formed power and finally qualify to be a real hero, thus making his dreams a reality. Though that is just the glorified way of saying it. Around here I noticed that the story often struggles with balancing whether or not it wants to handle this plot in a serious manner or a not-so-serious manner, which makes up for some rather rough transitions down the road when the serious arcs role around.\\n\\n\r\nAnyhow, the premise of the story is not the problem I have with it, but rather it's the way they went of doing things. I was personally hoping to see the plot move in a bit more serious fashion or maybe have a bit more focus on the implications and alternation of society as a whole from suddenly receiving these bizarre super powers out of the blue. Though this is a shounen after all, so we ended up taking a more shounen-ish approach to things as we follow Deku and friends through their many trials and tribulations. Unfortunately, when compared to series of the similar nature like last year's One Punch Man, it ends up falling short.\\n\\n\r\nWith other genres to the side, a big portion of time and effort is spent on action and comedy, as you would normally expect from a shounen series. The action scenes are usually handled fairly well due to the bizarre nature of the Quirks and there being basically no limitations to what one can and can't do which in turn makes up for some interesting scenarios. And Bones being Bones, the animation is as consistant as you can imagine. The comedy, on the other hand, is very lackluster and more often than not just ends up falling completely flat. And if it miraculously does somehow end up being even remotely funny, then you can be sure that they will re-use the same joke 5 times over and run it to the ground. A good example of this would be the gag of Allmight being anorexic.\\n\\n\r\nThis section plays a significant role in the series decline as like with most other shounen, the characters aren't developed that well at all. Though, that is not something I should entirely fault it for, especially considering the genre at hand. However, Boku no Hero Academia misses a very crucial opportunity here. Do you know what all the top-tier shounen all have in common? They have an actual likable main cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nThus, we enter Midoriya Izuku, otherwise known simply as Deku. Deku, being the protagonist of the story of course doesn't have a quirk of his own and was therefore looked down upon by his peers throughout his entire life. The amount of victimization they give to this character can get pretty overwhelming at times, seeing as at one point he is laughed at by everyone in his classroom even with the teacher being present and everything. They really went all-out to make this guy the ultimate underdog, to the point where it sometimes just irritates me to watch him. He's weak, can't stand up for himself and is socially awkward around girls. However, this all changes when he conveniently meets up with his favorite and most powerful hero in all of existence and gets taken under his wing. After that, he is fed a piece of hair, thus receiving superpowers. Hooray! \\n\\n\r\nI really thought it couldn't get any worse but here we are. Bakugou Katsuki is Deku's psychopath of a childhood friend, his biggest bully as well as his possible rival later on. He is usually a tool from which Deku's victimization during the series stems from, as Kacchan here is completely mental. It is heavily implied throughout the series by Deku that he became the way he is now after \"straying off the path\" and receiving his Quirk, yet it was clearly shown in multiple flashbacks what an egotistical maniac he was even during his childhood. There really aren't any justifiable factors for this guy. His character is very basic and doesn't ever go beyond him being a self-absorbed cunt who wants to be the best at everything for extremely shallow and selfish reasons. \\n\\n\r\nThen there are some other main characters that didn't leave me much to write about either because they either weren't utilized properly or were just not very good. Allmight is the object of Deku's admiration as well as his questionably-anorexic mentor. He usually ends up defeating the villains in a few seconds and has some semi-inspirational dialogue throughout the series but is ultimately overshadowed for the majority of the show, up until the final 2 episodes. Uraraka is pretty cute and ends up giving Deku panic attacks whenever she talks to him due to his seemingly crippling anxiety around girls. I don't remember the armored guy's name but he's pretty cool. As for the antagonists, their motivations never get explored and we're just left to our imagination.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for Boku no Hero definitely isn't bad by any means, it's just very unappealing so to say. With a very cartoonish style to it, it has a sort of unique feel to it, yet still somehow looks ugly. This complaint is nearly nonexistent when it comes to the backgrounds but is very much there when I stare at the character designs for too long. Midoriya's design faintly reminds me of diarrhea, for one reason or another. Bones has continuously produced some of the best animation through each passing season for years now so no surprise here. Since it heats up during the intense moments of the show the fights are quite nice to watch. Most of the tracks from the OST were unnoticeable apart from the main theme and another track which's timing was nailed very well every time to enhance the feeling of dread once the antagonists showed up. I enjoyed the ending and especially the opening theme a lot and the voice acting was solid, albeit there were some performances that I found to be annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment of the show will mostly depend on how big of a fan of shounen you are. If you go in with the assumption that it will suck, you may be pleasantly surprised like I was when the latter half rolled around. It has deplorable humor which is a miss in 90% of cases which can easily ruin a series for me and that really was the case for the first few episodes, but eventually I just tried looking past it. The final 3-4 episodes of the show is where shit hits the fan and I don't remember the last time I was this entertained while watching a seasonal anime. Essentially, if you're a shounen fan looking for some dumb fun you'll probably love it, and if you're coming in with a skeptical mindset then try to look past the first few episodes, as the show gets better the longer it goes on.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I don't think Boku no Hero Academia is that bad of a series. Sure, it has its fair share of problems here and there but what my rating mostly stems from is when I compare it to other series in the same vein, be it a regular shounen or the example that I have previously mentioned which is OPM. It has a story with some potential to be found but a very mediocre and slightly disappointing execution, with every character in the show being either extremely unlikable and annoying or simply bad. At times it takes itself too seriously and at others not seriously enough, which makes up for some pretty awkward transitioning.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of shounen series, I'd recommend Boku no Hero with a grain of salt as hopefully you don't come in with your previous completed series being FMA and end up setting the bar too high. Though, if you're an easygoing person who's just looking for some dumb fun then this is definitely your go-to this season. All in all, it's not bad and is certainly not good but mainly fails to live up to the hype created by the community.",

            "content": "\"All men are not created equal. This was the reality about society that I learned at a young age of four.\" \r\nThus begins the journey of Izuku \"Deku\" Midoriya, a dreamer, who's passion and wish is to become like his idol and role model, the Symbol of Peace, the one and only All Might. \r\nThere was never a shadow of doubt that My Hero Academia was slated to divide opinions among fans for all the not quite correct-- but inevitable reasons. Enter Izuku Midoriya, a cheerful but an extremely introvert middle school teenager who feels neglected by the society, not because of his depressive tendenciesor anything but that he's a \"Quirkless\" among the more common ones born with \"Quirks\". Quirks are something which has become a norm in the world of My Hero Academia. Nowadays most people born in the planet consist of the 80% of population which mysteriously develop supernatural powers titled as Quirks. Quirks can vary from the personalities to the genetics of the given person, and there is no clear explanation as to how the powers can manifest within a human's body. As quickly as one can comprehend it, this is the way of life portrayed in the series, and it revolves around Izuku, who is now one of those rare cases where there is no sign of a Quirk developing in his body. \\n\\n\r\nFans of the Shounen genre know all too well what to expect from the series. And for it to be coming with an ordinary premise that has been done multiple times within the genre (Which as I said earlier can divide opinions easily.), My Hero Academia certainly has its highs and lows. It gets off to a cheesy start with its nail-bitingly snail-like pace and has a nostalgic feeling to it, albeit the premise gets the better of it and it feels very underwhelming. At this point it doesn't provide sufficient meat to the viewer and it doesn't come off as surprising if the viewer decides to drop the show. While the show picks up on it and precedes it by changing the momentum and present more material to the viewer, the inception of the series leaves a bad aftertaste which cannot be shrugged off. After the initial first four episodes, the series starts to change gears and while it becomes more battle-oriented, it also doesn't leave out the characters that drive it and adds more to them. Once Izuku establishes his very own skill set after registering into the prestigious school of heroes, The Yuuei (U.A.) Academy, things look brighter for him and there's more insight to what creates and identifies him. The mid phases of the series is also where the rivalry of Izuku and his life-long friend and also enemy, Katsuki Bakugo, is at its peak. \\n\\n\r\nIzuku Midoriya takes the center-stage in the show accompanied by All Might, who Izuku thinks of highly and his childhood rival, Katsuki. Izuku is  depicted as a very timid, a slightly eccentric but still a cheerful boy who's one and only wish is to be a hero like his idol. In a matter of thirteen episodes, My Hero Academia manages to flesh out the basic characteristics of Izuku as he tries to overcome bullies who ridicule him on being born without any quirks. The show doesn't shy away from flashing the reality across Izuku time and time again, which gives it a little more meaning to the trials Izuku has to overcome to become like the hero he always admired. Katsuki Bakugo, who Izuku dearly calls as Kacchan, is the exact but a superior opposite to Izuku. From a very early age he is shown as someone who has immense pride in himself. This is only justified more when Katsuki's flashy quirk manifests. The middle stages of the show focuses more on the one-off between Izuku and Katsuki, and excels at presenting Katsuki's extreme pride in himself and him having a superiority complex. All Might can be said to be the most polarized character from the show. What starts as a super hero with generic drawings and whose power is not revealed, leaves a trail of identity behind which makes the viewer slowly draw in towards his charm and ultimately like him towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nI have always been a fan of Studio Bones and their extremely quirky and exaggerated drawing style. My Hero Academia was a case of the two making a perfect couple. Put together with Horikoshi Kosei's Marvel and DC-inspired characters' art style, Studio Bones did what they do best at presenting the honest and fluid animations as they always have. While its a perfect ten on the visual aspect, its also a subject of mere taste. Many are put off by the Americanized character designs and personalities. So in general, its a hit or a miss on the visuals. \\n\\n\r\nGetting to the sound and auditory aspects of the show, the voice acting of the characters plays a big role in conveying the full material to the audience and it was no different with My Hero Academia. Yamashita Daiki's vocals are synced to perfection with Izuku's timid characteristics. He also does an excellent job at being rational and calm while doing the narration as well. Okamoto Nobuhiko's presenation of Katsuki was nothing short of a spectacle in the show. Katsuki's psyched up reactions are handled masterfully by the pumped up and convoluted voice of Nobuhiko. Not to say that Kenta Miyake's job as All Might was any easier. \"There is no need for fear. Why? Because I'm here!\" These lines always burst out the joy within me. \"The Day\" by Porno Graffitti was a perfect choice for the intro and for a classic battle shounen such as My Hero Academia and it will definitely make your blood boil. In a season filled with some amazing openings, The Day without a shred of doubt took the spotlight. \"HEROES\" by Brian the Sun was nothing short of amazing too. It was more centered around Izuku's character and him coming of age. \\n\\n\r\nIf you love shounen anime's, then My Hero Academia will deliver. There is no doubt about that, but its a matter of perspective. It has fights which are more tactically focused and it keeps the audience on the edge of their seats, and has cool characters with some ridiculous powers. My Hero Academia has a wider prospect as a second season is officially announced. The first season is an answer to the potential to be good, and that answer is yes. \\n",

            "content": "Perhaps the next \u201cbig thing\u201d by Shounen Jump. It was inevitable that Boku no Hero Academia (My Hero Academia) would get an anime adaptation. A matter of time and it eventually did. The premise is rather simple and classic for a battle shounen. It takes place in an academy setting with the main character trying to become a hero after being inspired by All Might (his idol hero) and others who vowed to protect their world from villains. Up to this point, there has been all sorts of battle shounen series adapted by Shounen Jump so it was time for superheroes to step up tothe plate.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Izuku Midoriya is a young boy who is born without powers. As such, he is mocked by peers, especially a childhood bully named Bakugo. As evidenced from many flashbacks, he is mocked because of how useless he is while the most of his class all developed powers (or otherwise known as \u201cQuirks\u201d) It goes far to the point where he is even nicked named \u201cDeku\u201d for being useless. Although the initial story establishes Deku as a weakling, this changes after he meets All Might, a superhero who is famous in their world.\\n\\n\r\nA general idea about the show is that Deku is constantly trying to prove himself and to others. Early episodes shows that he is fearlessly loyal to his friends and those he wishes to protect. This also includes Bakugo because Deku always wanted to surpass him after seeing how cool he is. Meanwhile, it\u2019s evident that Deku has potential to become a powerful hero himself. All Might gives him the opportunity by letting Deku borrow his Quirk. After training and determination, Deku establishes himself as a newcomer to keep an eye on while Bakugo grows more jealous of his rival\u2019s abilities. That\u2019s also one of the interesting aspects of the show \u2013 the character relationships. Deku develops many relationships throughout the series. These include the rivalry between himself and Bakugo, the student-master relationship with All Might, and various friendships at school. Through these relationships, we see how Deku brings the best and worst out of characters. And believe me, there\u2019s quite a lot of characters with their colorful personalities in this series.\\n\r\nWith such a large cast, you may be asking yourself \u201chow does the director plan to adapt this show?\u201d Unfortunately, the series is structured to be a 1-cour with a mere 13 episodes. The ongoing manga has over 90 chapters while pacing of the adaptation seems slow. The plus side is that the \u201cslow\u201d also translates to faithfulness as every episode in the series is consistent and leaves nothing important out. As a fan of the manga, I\u2019m proud to say that the series accurately does what it needed to do. I can\u2019t speak for everyone though as the comedy can occasionally feel like a hit or miss for some fans. Although on a subjective level, it\u2019s very popcornish humor that is there for some good fun. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the character casting, the show does a neat job at characterizing most of them. Each of them has a different personality, a different Quirk, and unique persona that makes them individually talented. Some of the more prominent characters such as Iida, Uaraka, Todoroki all get their screen time that will be memorable for fans. In the meantime, it\u2019s important to visualize that each character also has a reason to become a hero. So in retrospect, the characters aren\u2019t there just to push Deku\u2019s story but also have story themselves. The downside is that the characterization is condensed for this adaptation as result of the minimal episode figures.\\n\\n\r\nIt would also seem inevitable that the show is inspired by other genres and shounen jump works. The generic Exam Arc can be easily compared to series such as Naruto or Hunter x Hunter although with different styles. Meanwhile, there\u2019s the whole underdog premise with the main character trying to make a name in their world. Still, the show is definitely fun to watch as it also seems to be inspired by American comic heroes. Popular series in North America such as The Flash, Arrow, etc all have heroes and there\u2019s some resemblance that can be taken to account for this series. All Might stands out as the poster boy, Deku is the most prominent underdog, while Bakugo is portrayed as the hardcore antihero. And of course, we can\u2019t forget about the villains either. In contrast to the heroic resemblance of the good guys, the villains are designed to look malevolent. The show does a nice job at introducing them without shoving them down the audience\u2019s throats. Villains such as Stain and Kurogiri looks legitimately menacing. It also invites the anime only fans to wonder about their intentions, roles, and how powerful they really are. Because really, the show is literally saturated with all sorts of powers. You name it. We got super strength, explosive punches, gravity manipulation, superhuman flight, ice and fire control, invisibility, and even a girl who can use frog-like abilities. For a world with about 80% humans capable of using supernatural powers, it comes with a cool features.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by studio Bones, the show creatively designs its characters that matches a fair amount of consistency. Let\u2019s face it, Kouhei Horikoshi is an underrated mangaka and his previous works weren\u2019t considered major successes. Here, we got this show that has superheroes, action, and it just seems like every shounen fan\u2019s wet dream. The character designs, while looks generic, is also creatively attractive. Every character has their own unique appearance and those who are heroes are equipped with a stylistic costume. I can\u2019t say this enough but if there\u2019s anything to remember this show, Boku no Hero Academia should definitely deserve some sort of reward of \u2018Best Character Designs of the Year\u2019. The action is well choreographed as well when you see punches landing or super powers connecting as how it should. Furthermore, character expressions brings out the best of personalities whether it\u2019s fierce (Bakugo), Charming (Urakara), or heroic (All Might). Deku\u2019s reactions are mostly comedic although when he gets hyped up, there\u2019s a lot to keep an eye on as well. \\n\\n\r\nAh Yuuki Hayashi. I was ecstatic after seeing his name appear as the music director as his work on Haikyuu!! Is nothing short of wonderful. Indeed, the music and soundtrack of the show is a solid demonstration of his talent in this show. It is crisp, intense, and cinematic all the same time. For a battle shounen series like this, it\u2019s important to capture every important scene and the music delivered just that \u2013 making them relevant. The OP and ED theme songs are also creatively crafted with flamboyant choreography and style. Finally, praise should also be given to the voice acting especially for All Might and Bakugo as their character personalities really shines when you listen to their voice. \\n\\n\r\nSo in the end, what should you expect from this show? There\u2019s a lot and if you\u2019re a big fan of battle shounen, then this will be a wonderful treat. From diverse character cast to the high dosage of superhero action, Boku no Hero Academia is a very fun show to watch. Despite my issue with the pacing, it is still consistent on most parts with the manga. With the announcement of the second season, there's still a lot of potential waiting to be explored. All in all, the show is recommendable to anyone. Whether you\u2019re a new viewer getting into anime or a seasonal fan of shounen series, it\u2019s a show that\u2019s nothing short of exciting.\\n",

            "content": "If I were to ask you what you aspired to be, what would be your answer? Everyone lives their life chasing dreams, no matter how big or small. Dreams, goals, aspirations; these elements make up each individuals world and are part of what keeps life unique.\r\nThe dreams we focus on throughout the anime Boku no Hero Academia are those of Izuku; a young boy who aspires to be the greatest hero in a world filled with heroes. This is no menial task, seeing that each man and woman in this world was born with a quirk (superpower) that gives them a clear advantage over youngIzuku who was curiously born without one.\\n\\n\r\nNow, originally I had planned to give this anime a lower score (8 or 9) to try to tend my review to a larger audience. The reason behind this decision was because the show itself was nothing notably different or unique. The story was that of a young man who wanted to be a hero, and who accomplishes such through blood, sweat and tears. In retrospect, it's a story we've seen hundreds of time throughout the years in anime. \\n\\n\r\nNow, take a moment, and peer at the world \"originally.\" I had *planned* to give this show a lower score because I knew some people felt it generic. This is something I had considered around episode 5 - 7. I've now finished the show, and have tossed that idea in the trash and burned it. \\n\\n\r\nThis show, in my honest opinion, is a must watch of the Spring anime season and is well deserving of a 10. The story is indeed something we've seen a multitude of times before, but this show took that story and made it special. I've seen so many zero to hero animes that I never would have imagined watching another that could illicit the emotions this one did in me. This show managed to pull my full attention and to really immerse me in the world it was meant to portray. \\n\\n\r\nI found that by the end of the series I had grown very fond of the protagonist for his die-hard attitude; and had found myself inspired by All Might, the same man who had inspired our protagonist himself. All Might was one of the best representations of a role model character I have seen, he was actually an adult I looked up to in an anime, which is truly something special after all the side character adults I've seen in shows who are simply there to crack a pun every episode or two. To add to this, each character in the show was given a unique personality that didn't fit any prior anime cliches, something I feel is uncommon in this age of anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound work in the show was fantastic. The OST fit the setting and genre of the show, and the OP and ED are both ones I looked forward to listening to each week. The art was well done and I never noticed any 'lazy' frames or glaring mistakes - the animation was smooth and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I really enjoyed watching Boku no Hero Academia. The show felt very much like \"Haikyuu\" in the sense that you wanted to see each character succeed and left the show each week feeling motivated to be the best version of yourself. If you've not already seen this show, then go watch it - if you dropped it because you felt it was generic, I suggest revisiting it; it's well worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nNow get out there and be your own heroes; I'll see you again for Season 2. \\n\r\nPLUS ULTRA\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story 4: My Hero Academia is a story about superheroes learning at an academia. Except it isn't. It starts that way, but it isn't that way. Deku works so hard just to go to a school we don't get to pay attention to. People say it is just a typical shounen, but a typical shounen would have tried to flesh out the school life a little. When you have such a unique school setting for once, you decide to just blow it. It's so stupid. The story is very, very character focused and overly convenient. You go from entrance exams to showing off a reallypowerful set of villains and how the fledgling heroes act in a crisis almost immediately, right when we were just feeling like it would possibly be a more developed world. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9: There are a ton of character designs, which is amazing to me. There are some exceptionally cute character designs, which is not something that I have said about any anime before. It also doesn't shy away from mixing big muscle and a slightly more Western style with the typical skinny young anime heroes aesthetic. There is nothing really lacking, but it isn't artistic enough to warrant a 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8: I don't remember much of the sound, but I have a feeling the soundtrack isn't a weak point. I'm not at all a fan of the opening theme, but the ending isn't too bad. Usually I don't factor in openings or endings into the sound department too much though since they aren't made by the team behind the anime usually.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6: Characters SHOULD be higher, but I still feel like the only ones they really care about are the biggest protagonists. Even with trying to give a lot of characters  a little time to develop, it is done in such unnatural form that it doesn't feel nice. The only exception in this arc was Iida, who really got to show what they were like at heart. All Might is annoying character. While it might seem deep to give such a strong character a weakness, it just feels like an excuse for weak writing and a reason to have a slightly unnecessary tutor character like in Naruto or Reborn!. Yes it may have been the start of the story and a central plot point, but it doesn't work well in the long run and All Might basically just proves that the time limit he placed on himself might mean nothing at all, which makes things feel extra fake. Maybe once the injury is explained, we can understand his reasoning because i don't get why it would hinder him so much.\\n\r\nThe main character Midoriya, nicknamed Deku, is really a solid shounen protagonist since he is truly thoughtful, studious and passionate and gets to where he is at the beginning by pure hard work. But how his power develops is very, very shaky because we don't get to see him train the power directly. His rival is very well presented, has a great character design and you can really feel that he has deeper motivations in everything that will probably develop further even if other developments were dropped.\\n\r\nOne character I absolutely hated was that baby. There is no reason why he exists. His personality is bad and quirk is useless so it doesn't make sense that he got into the Academy with the highest standards. Additionally, Sui's reaction to him is terrible.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3: I was able to watch 26 episodes of Hero Academia, which is more than I can say for basically all of the few anime I get around to trying. But that may have just been because I was curious about the world since I was in an RP discord server and wondering what made the world stand out. Still, I was not excited past the first two episodes. There wasn't too much that caught my attention after they got to the exams and school, except Deku's rivalry and showing off new character skills, which is just too flat for me. There was also the feeling that the plot wasn't properly explored at all by skipping to a major fight so quickly in place of what could have been a very interesting event (learning how to rescue people in natural disasters or something like that).",

            "content": "I love this series so much that I rated it a 1. My reason being there isn't enough intense romantic situations as i would've hoped. What I mean is how the big lady hero is big and people always make posts about how hot she is but I really don't see any fan service at all in the series. Same goes for the momo lookin frog girl. Like there are soooo many slightly decent looking girls but i don't see enough fan service which is a major problem when it comes to making animes. Sure I could always go to Rule 34 for that kindof stuff but it just ain't the same as the original source cause the art is always different and wack. All i'm saying is redo the entire series but with WAY more Fan service and I would and lets be honest Everyone would like the show better bcuz right now its pretty trash. I am speaking for everyone when i say this but everyone just pretends its a good show anyways but since no one listens i guess i'm the first to tell the truth. Please share this and hopefully the creators will respond.",

            "content": "Hi there it's actually my first time writing a review. *I NEVER PLANNED TO WRITE ANY, BUT THIS IS A TRUE EXCEPTION*\r\nIf you are a fan of this, it would be in your best interests not to continue reading. \r\nAnyways bear with me. A sentence to summarize this whole show? \"the most overrated cliche shounen anime with ripped off ideas from a marvel movie forcefully jammed together with childish ideals\"\r\nThe story.\r\nI can go on and on about this it was absolutely dreadful and the most cringiest setting I have encountered.\r\nA bland boy suddenly gets superpowers from a hero and starts training and fights for eons.Amazing. It's repetitive like the filler stories of Naruto except it's all squeezed into a season.\\n\\n\r\nThe art.\\n\r\nNot bad really, colors were well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nyeah classic booms and other normal sound effects. The theme songs were nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nCharacters are well dictionary definitions. Please. There's a difference between exaggerated to definition characters. The main character is a textbook example of a one dimensional character with no background other than he was born without powers. \"I wanna be a hero!\" says he but all he ever does is write diary entries about current superheroes and does nothing to even train for it. He gets bullied and never fights back. As a survival instinct  you usually defend yourself to avoid damage and things get cringey. His academic skills aren't special too. Normal. Normal. Normal. Wait, to be fair underdog is a realistic opinion.\\n\r\nHis childhood friend would then be the definition of emo. He hates poor \"does nothing but daydream\" kun and bullies him. I can understand, all he ever did when I watched the episodes was talk about his dreams but still, way too violent.\\n\r\nOthers are poor representations of emotions and ideals like the movie inside out (inside out was good).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: No. Shounen for kids? Yes. Adults? Unless you really like this stuff no. No. No.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Just please no. It's overrated anime that should be called more of a cartoon. I've heard some say this is better than SAO and I really must protest. Yes I know SAO haters hate hate hate because Kirito is bland and his female counterparts are all lovey doves with him and there's tons of other issues like story skipping. I accept that and agree with the constructive criticism. BUT this is the most overrated I repeat overrated anime (ahem cartoon) I have ever seen.",

            "content": "I've come across a few anime of this genre, and I can't rack my brains around how they so consistently amass a large following. Whether the premise is confined to a school; the world; a personal journey; a collective journey; comedy; harem or on a more serious tone. Maybe the recently sensationalised marvel universe has enchanted the masses into submission. \r\nBoku no Hero Academia seems to touch on a few of the above mentioned bases without the core themes being disjointed on paper. The problem however, is that the ultimate relay is a lukewarm exploration into topics it clearly took a more juvenile approach toand ultimately finds its themes disjointed. Which is why I'd  say this is for the younger audience, as I can't imagine this being taken seriously by an older demographic. \\n\\n\r\nBoku no Hero Academia is about a world where 80% of the population is born with quirks, or in other words, some 'super power'. One of the problems I had right away is with the properties of these powers - they were mostly just painfully juvenile and often times lacked any practicality in more or less any scenario. This problem is inevitable if you are going to build a premise of a barrage of characters having said powers. This would have been OKAY if not for the fact that EVERYONE WANTS TO BE A HERO. What's worse, more or less, THEY ARE. To enjoy anime is to often times suspend disbelief, but when you are presented with characters that have lame heroes with powers like climbing walls or shooting balls of goo, it is hard to take seriously. More or less, the majority of other characters also have abilities that any pistol would outdo from a militaristic standpoint. This would have been OKAY if the anime was mostly confined to a comedy genre, but it ISN'T - it tries to take a serious tone with melodramatic and black and white depictions of good and evil.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to the other problem; characters. Alot of characters, but few backgrounds explored. And the ones explored are as what you'd expect if you notice the rest of the show - childish. The MC is a pansy kiss ass without any resolve beyond the shows projected fight for its black and white justice.He always wanted to be a hero despite not being born with a quirk and now conveniently has one, thus fulfilling his dream. That's the sum of his character.  The blonde haired secondary (forget his name), has probably the worst background to date in anime - he hates the MC despite being friends in the past because the MC asked if he was okay after an accident that had nothing to do with the MC, and now this terrible secondary vows vengeance against him throughout the series. One of the worst narratives I've come across. The rest of the characters are also the lame righteous knights without faults for the most part, and as mentioned, don't have much backgrounds explored, and their overall personalities are just a lot of ''I want to be a hero'', to be well, a hero. No backgrounds beyond that for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nThe villains were as you would also expect, the other polar end of the good and evil spectrum. The main antagonist pushes to upset the balance of peace for the sake of destruction and fame. Full stop. Moving on. The only one villain in the show that has any character is 'Hero Killer Stain', whom has an agreeable philosophy to mine - ''there are too many heroes''. The rest of the antagonists seem to just be an extension to the main antagonist with their viewpoints aligned. No individuality to comment on. This union is structurally symmetrical to the hero's society. Bleh. \\n\\n\r\nStory :\\n\\n\r\nThe story is just a function of the above mentioned character design. Light vs Dark. Good vs Evil. Beyond the plot, the combat is mildly enjoyable if you can move past the question of practicality,as it is actually rather well choreographed. Beyond this, the actual concepts of their abilities were a bit too juvenile for my taste. They tried to incorporate a strategic front to the combat, but it was often times a little too simplistic or unreasonable even within their own framework. The absence of death or gore to boot only made the show lack suspense.  Again, no problem with that, but I find it more for a younger audience. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art is one thing I can't criticise at all.\\n\\n\r\n Ultimately, I did manage to get through the show without too much struggle, but it's more of a show to simply pass the time rather than take something with you. Put it on the bucket list if a fun combat oriented anime is for you, but probably place it on the lower end. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "In a world, where all of a sudden humanity has gained superpowers called Quirks\u2026 \r\nA world, in which almost all humans look like alien mutants and the crime rate has significantly increased\u2026 \r\nWhere being a hero is considered a profession and Saitama definitely doesn\u2019t exist\u2026  There exists a boy who belongs to the minority that doesn\u2019t have a superpower... \r\nThe boy, called Izuku Midoriya, has a dream\u2026 He wants to be the mightiest hero of all, he wants to become the second ALL MIGHT!\r\nThe very young protagonist, despite having no Quirk, tries his very best to become one. But is that possible at all,when the profession \u201chero\u201d is all about being strong? And how could one possibly beat superhuman powers if you don\u2019t have a special ability?\\n\\n\\n\r\nBoku no Hero Academia is set in a modern world where every single person wants to become a hero to save the useless people that don\u2019t know what to do with their Quirks from the bad people who use their abilities to wreak havoc and be evil. Being a hero and become the focus of attention is way better than doing mundane things such as becoming a random office worker, right? \\n\r\nThis is where the first problem arises. How can society work if the 80% that have superpowers want to become a hero? And if, on top of that, not having a Quirk is being looked down upon; and doing everything that needs to be done to make everyday life function correctly is disregarded, why would these normal (or maybe abnormal) people even bother? You, the reader, must realize that there is no way the farmers will be able to produce enough food if their population decreases by 80%. Society can simply NOT function in the way this world is presented to us. But hey, since there is a superpower for anything, this might just be miraculously solved!\\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way, I\u2019ll start talking about the main plot. The main character Midorima, in his eagerness to become a hero, takes notes on every hero he sees and looks how they fight against villains. But since he himself has no Quirk, it is very hard for him to become a hero. This is also why many other kids in his class look down on him, making his life more miserable. On top of that, his \u201cchildhood friend\u201d, who is constantly bullying him, makes him realize all the more that it would be an impossible task for a quirkless person. \\n\r\nIt seems like his quest for becoming a hero will certainly fail, when he has a fateful encounter with an emaciated geezer that always coughs up blood. This encounter proves to change his life radically, because Deus ex Machina is overwhelmingly overpowered and seems to be able to solve any problem without much effort. Well, maybe not exactly without much effort, but certainly it is a half-assed way to solve things. This is when he sees a light at the end of the endless darkness. HOPE! He can maybe become a hero!\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe next section I will discuss is characters. Although the cast of character is certainly not huge, being most of them sidekick heroes or unimportant hero students, there are four important characters in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Izuki Midoriya, is a young boy that at the beginning of the show hasn\u2019t entered high school yet. During his whole life he aimed to be a hero, but it seemed as though his Quirk never wanted to appear. Despite that, he continually worked hard to become one through studying alone. He obviously will succeed, as he is the protagonist. That aside, this character seems to evolve slightly, going from a total coward to someone that dares to speak up (a bit). Although he isn\u2019t a total retard, his personality is still the same as most shounen protagonists.\\n\\n\r\nThe second main character, Bakugou, is supposed to be Izuki\u2019s childhood friend, which completely baffled me, as this character is constantly bullying the protagonist bcuz eevil is gud and is objectively superior since he has a nice \u201cbang\u201d. It\u2019s also rather annoying that he underwent a sudden character change; all of a sudden he is a \u201cgood\u201d guy, and the reason to it is rather stupid.\\n\\n\r\nAnother character introduced to us is the emaciated geezer, who is something like a mentor to Midoriya. He is the responsible for making it possible for the protagonist to become a hero and has an interesting story which I won\u2019t tell because spoilers. Nevertheless, I really doubt his choice-making ability, as Midoriya doesn\u2019t seem that special to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe only female lead is a girl called Ochako, whom Izuki met in the hero entrance exam and seems to be nice to Izuki, without any reason. She is a dimensionless character who doesn\u2019t really add anything to the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThus concludes the characters section and starts another one; sound and animation.\\n\r\n\tAs for the sound, the music played throughout the different scenes was satisfying; there was no mismatch between music and type of scene. The used soundtracks were well used and could be considered good. Furthermore, the voice actors played their role well and managed to match the personalities of the characters with their voices. The opening and ending themes were shit as with nearly all shows, and nothing anyone says can change this particular opinion of mine. Overall nothing special in this regard, only what is required to not make it disturbing.\\n\r\n\tThe animation used in this show was good enough; background was well done (though it had no movement) and the moving parts were drawn well. Battle animations were fluid and special effects also transmitted all the information that was needed easily observe what is happening.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I\u2019ll discuss enjoyment and make a small summary of the show.\\n\r\n\tSurprisingly, this show managed to be enjoyable for me, for about 3 episodes. This is where the whole idea started to become too stereotypical and predictable, making me start to dislike it. As the show progressed, everything became more and more predictable; and thus more boring. All the Deus ex Machina didn\u2019t really help my enjoyment of the show either, contributing to the low score I gave to this section.\\n\\n\r\n\tIn essence, heroes are gud and villains are bad; small children must go into a hero academia to beat eevil. Even though there are some terrible people amongst these heroes. \\n\r\nDo I recommend Boku no Hero Academia? No, I don\u2019t think watching this is worth the time for people who actually think about what is happening in an anime while watching, because the amount of plot holes and inconsistencies is too big. For those who prefer to just enjoy a show and not think about it (or those that are new to anime), I do believe that it is worth watching, though.\\n\\n\r\nIf you read through all of this, I applaud you. Furthermore I would like to add that feedback is appreciated.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Boku no hero is one of the most overrated shounens today. And the reason is simple: It's easy to digest, it's generic, full of stereotypes, full of things that make an anime sell.\r\nStory: Is there history in this in the first place? Hardly a story, the story is simply shitty with nothing special. This is one of those completely generic stories of super heroes / battle shounen. Well the premise follows from deku a teenage boy who suffers discrimination and bully for not having superpowers. And now? How will he handle it? Are you going to give an equivalent exchange for that? Will you followyour journey without superpowers and many defects? Of course not, because in the third episode he already gets his super power. The most offensive is that the series creates so much melodrama in its first two episodes, you wonder; What was the point of these first episodes? Why so much melodrama?\\n\r\nIt completely contradicts his story and the whole message he wanted to pass. What a terrible message, and what terrible writing. The premise of this anime is so poorly executed that it makes it subtle naruto. Naruto was also a boy who suffered discrimination, was a person with many defects, BUT, naruto only contradicts his messages and premise in naruto shippuden. Good and after all these terrible messages and contradictions of boku no hero. History becomes nothing. It does not address any subject, and only sees a generic battle shounen with one-sided black-and-white assholes. The series is so childish and poorly written that the series itself says in his face \"This is the heroes and this is the villains, now ready, battle\"! The world-building is also horrible and meaningless: This is a story where 80% of the population has superpowers, and the world is just like ours. The series should have more seriousness with its construction of the world, should do something more creative, but no, the author is very lazy and prefers to do the most generic thing and the easiest thing to digest the world. I hear people saying that this shounen is very creative. Creative where ?. The series is basically naruto and a copy of a thousand shounens. Pos has a school and in which shounen does not have it? There is a protagonist who suffers discrimination and who is very determined and crying, he tells me, in which shounen does not have it? The protagonist has a rival, history has a tournament, history has some training arcs. In the end, I could cite billions of cliches that this shit has.  The only good thing about this story is that the story is fast paced and fun. It has a lot of action to spend time. But another defect is that the story is full of internal monologues, inutile dialogues and so on. But as I said it all earlier. The story is full of contradictions and stereotypes and bad messages. Just terrible story.\\n\\n\r\nWell, at least this story has good characters? No, it does not. As I said before, the anime is basically a naruto 2.0. The characters are terrible, clich\u00e9s and has no development at all. Deku is the typical protagonist who undergoes discrimination and soon becomes a more and more perfect person who gets everything on his journey, all with extreme ease. The bakugou is a sasuke 2.0, only worse. Completely one-dimensional character. His only characteristic is to be a fucking asshole. And you see, the character does not even have a motivation to be a jerk. It's one of the worst characters I've ever seen, just detestable. And people like this character shit just because it has COOLS powers. There's also a guy named all might, who is a super muscular guy and COOL, his name is all might and trained a boy, does not this remind you of naruto? Of course as I said before, the series is a naruto 2.0. The other characters are shallow, barely important and have no development at all. The only good character is the all might, despite being a plot device, it's a charismatic character, it's cool. Everyone else has no way\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is even good, very good to speak the truth. All the action scenes are very well produced. The design although it seems generic, is not as generic as we think. It looks like a cartoon mix with anime, and all the characters are quite different from one another. There's a certain creativity in character design, it's a pretty cool design.\\n\\n\r\nOverall boku no hero is a lousy anime. Terrible messages, terrible characters, zero creativity, and terrible and convenient story. Their only good aspects are the outer parts. Like ost, animation, character design, all this is very nice and cool for a series of action. And do not tell me that the second season gets better, because it's the same old shit, but even more tedious. And I do not even want to see the third. Enough, impossible to improve.",

            "content": "Overrated, childish, and cliche. Those are the first three words that come to mind when I think of this anime.\r\nThis is the most overrated anime that has came out in the past 5 years. After watching two seasons of this anime, I've come to the conclusion that this anime is absolute garbage with no redeeming qualities. I actually cant believe that people above the age of 15 can be watching this. It's actually crazy...This review might also contain spoilers. I cant fully explain how bad this show is without including spoilers unfortunately. This review will also not only be about season 1.\r\nThis is hands downthe most basic and generic shounen I've ever come across. The story is very stupid and cliche. The story is about a kid that wants to become a professional hero. It cant get anymore generic than that. So almost everyone in the world has quirks but Midoriya apparently doesn't. Ok. He then receives a quirk given to him by all might. That's just lame to be honest. I don't like how he just gets a quirk given to him. I'd rather see him training to get his own quirk. If anyone here is familiar with Black Clover, then you know how Asta got his own powers after training right? Even Black Clover did that better than My Hero Trashademia. How boring and uninteresting is it to see him just getting a power from someone else.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is extremely repetitive. They go to school and have training sessions, random villains attack, fight villains, villains run or get defeated, and that's it. Now sometimes it's a bit different, but for the most part shits exactly the same. Nomus attack, League of Villains attack, it's just the same boring shit. In conclusion, the plot is fucking terrible. The only good thing is that the pacing is fast and I don't have to watch 10 episodes for 1 fight. That's literally the only good thing about this awful anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said earlier, this is the most basic and cliche shounen I've seen in a while. After finishing the first season I just thought, why the fuck are people hyping this up? It's literally the same thing as every other generic battle shounen we've had in the past 20 years. It does nothing different yet I see shounen fanboys everywhere sucking it off for what??\\n\\n\r\nThis anime easily has one of the worst cast of characters I've ever seen. The mangaka just tries to give ALL of them screen time it just doesn't work. In the end, barely any of them get character development at all. They're so bad I barely can even remember their names, even after two seasons of watching it. There's nothing interesting about the main characters either. There's nothing interesting about Bakugo. I don't know how anyone can like a character that screams 24/7 and gets absolutely no character development whatsoever. Midoriya has to be one of the most boring characters I've seen in a Shounen. His character development is just basic shounen character development. One second he's a pussy and the next he's extremely serious. It just makes no sense. As for Todoroki he's just a garbage Zuko rip off (but zukos actually a good character) with daddy issues. As I said before, this anime is extremely cliche and bad characters like this just prove it.\\n\\n\r\nThere's just too many irrelevant characters that get screen time for no reason. The only students that need a lot of screentime would be Midoriya, Bakugo, Uraraka, Momo, Frog, and Tokoyami. All these other characters shouldn't be getting screen time when they have little to none impact on the plot. If anyone here is familiar with Gundam Iron Blooded Orphans, use that as an example. The writers for that anime tried to give too many characters screen time and it turned out to be a complete failure filled with underdeveloped characters. The same thing is happening with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has the worst character designs I've seen in a Shounen. I honestly could not stand looking at these people. These characters just look so damn goofy and childish I felt like I was watching a childrens cartoon. Mineta, Alien looking girl, dude with the tape quirk. There's just way too many goofy looking characters to name them all. That's why this is the most childish anime I've ever watched. Not even joking. I've never seen an anime that looked goofier and more childish than this.\\n\\n\r\nThe music wasn't that great either. The only good opening is the first one. The endings are all pretty bad. There was only one memorable OST which played during fight scenes, and that got annoying real quick.\\n\\n\r\nOne good thing about this show is Stain. I think he's the only good villain in this entire show, all three seasons. But besides Stain, every other villain is complete and utter garbage! They're literally all just evil for the sake of being evil, especially that muscular guy. There's just no other interesting villains in My Hero Academia and that's fact. \\n\\n\r\nThe fights in this anime are very underwhelming. All might vs One for All, one of the most disappointing fights I've seen in a shounen. Why should I care about this trash villain One for All when he has no depth whatsoever? He was just used to make all might look badass before his career as a hero ended. Todoroki vs Midoriya, once again another bad fight. The only good part of this fight was the end, that's it. Everything before that wasn't good at all. All the animation was put into the ending of the fight and anything before that was just talking or just boring to watch in general. Uraraka vs Bakugo, a fight that many My Hero fans were sucking off around the time it came out. I... I don't understand why people think this is that good? When it comes to actual fighting/choreography My Hero Academia fights are complete trash. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this show is just awful and I don't suggest watching it. It's no different than any other generic battle Shounen anime you've watched. Bad characters, bad fights, bad plot, bad character designs, bad villains, bad everything. Don't watch this show.\\n\\n",

Usually not the case but everyone says it gets better. does it? does it really? \r\nno.\r\nStory: Typical. Done before. Pathetic uselesskid saves the world. not this season, but it's going to happen it's so predictable. \\n\\n\r\nArt: I'm okay with the art I guess, I really hate their eyes. I mean I can't draw worth shit so what do I know? But someone popped some cue balls in their eye sockets and drew pupils on them. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I'm giving it a high rating because the dub isn't terrible.

I can't stand most dubs, so props for finding voice actors that aren't 100% unbearable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: dear god. deku is the most annoying piece of garbage. I'm whiny and awful and bully people who don't want to be around me in the name of being disgustingly nice! I hope he dies. IcyHot fills in for 'bad boy v.2' because you need that tortured soul tragic backstory bad boy. Kacchan is really the only worthwhile character and even he is pretty awful. He's mean and isn't trying to be something he isn't. he's 100% his original self. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I longed for my dentist's chair. I would rather be getting told how I need to floss more while they make me bleed than watch this anime again. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: It's childish and unoriginal. I would have loved to see the impact of everyone having these crazy powers, like the world being thrown into chaos even for a little bit? Like that had to happen. The change didn't even happen THAT long ago but everyone accepts it as normal. WHY did everyone even get these powers. I guess if you are a child you might like it.

            "content": "For the spring 2016 Anime lineup, Boku no Hero Academia was considered as the main shounen title of the season, and for good reason. It had everything going for it that you\u2019d need in a good shounen and was something that could easily be picked up by anyone at any time. But the real thing to consider here is, even though it managed to stand as a good show to watch overall, was it truly able to Go Beyond (Plus Ultra!!) any of what the genre has set as its standard?\r\nStory:\r\nFor the most part, the story doesn\u2019t really have much to talk about. Well, atleast not yet. The show, like most others in the shounen genre seems to be of a rather extensive nature and considering the length of Academia, it\u2019s pretty understandable that they could only give us a small part of the story with just 13 episodes, thus leaving us with a plot that does leave behind a few hints of a deeper subject and some greater events to come but unfortunately also leaves the show in a rather incomplete and unsatisfying note. So we\u2019re not really getting any closure until maybe another season.\\n\\n\r\nBut let\u2019s talk about the actual contents. First off, while the concept is nothing new and has been done several times before, the show still manages to present it in a very \u2018fun\u2019 way. It maintains a very nice atmosphere and is able to carry out events in a manner that is very easy to digest and do not require much thinking to enjoy. While the story doesn\u2019t offer anything all that amazing and is rather linear, it is still enjoyable. One other thing that I particularly liked about the show is that it is very honest with itself. It knows exactly what it is and doesn\u2019t try too hard to be something that it\u2019s not. This way, everything always feels in place and none of the scenarios feel overdone or unfitting.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, even with all that, the show still did feel as if it was constantly missing something, like it just didn\u2019t have enough. Though I did say that I appreciated the fact that it doesn\u2019t try to be something it\u2019s not, it also doesn\u2019t try to ever improve or explore upon the aspects that do relate to it. It feels confined to a certain space which doesn\u2019t leave much room for diversity, thus lacking anything for the viewer to truly look forward to. Simply put, it\u2019s a very simple show with a simple setup.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\\n\r\nAcademia offers a simple and comic-like style of art. It might not have all that much detail, but it does hold a certain charm to it and is pleasing to look at. The character designs are also done nicely, again not much detail and are kept simple but that\u2019s what allows it to fit with the theme to a good extent. The animation did feel a bit clunky at times but was fairly smooth when it needed to be, such as during the action sequences which were always animated well enough.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is one of the better aspects of Academia. I always found the OST to be catchy and it always set the atmosphere for the show really well. Coupled with its style of presentation, it managed to set the mood for certain situations and even got me excited during some of it. The voice acting\u2019s also done well, but still not something I would praise.\\n\r\nThe opening sequence was well presented and did prove to be a good way to start the show, but eventually starts to lose its charm after a few episodes. After about 4 to 5 episodes, I found myself skipping through it at the start of each one..\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters do have some very interesting designs and fun personalities, there\u2019s hardly anything redeemable about any of them. Most characters within the show are very flat, they\u2019re exactly what\u2019s given to you at face value. There\u2019s no depth to them and most of them are very stereotypical. The main character himself follows a very generic underdog personality and development which can pretty much be seen anywhere within the shounen genre. There isn\u2019t anything wrong with sticking to the norm, but to not add your own uniqueness to it kind of is. Because of which, most of the cast just ends up feeling like a copy-paste of other shounen stereotypes. While the characters do have their own quirky personalities and are fun in their own way, they don\u2019t have anything to offer much beyond that, and eventually end up feeling rather plain and forgettable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPresentation:\\n\\n\r\nThis is the aspect which pretty much saves Academia from falling to a bad grade. Despite all the shortcomings, it still manages to be an entertaining show. It just offers a very lively feel and really puts you in the mood. Getting to experience all the different abilities and quirks that the many characters had, proved to be a rather enjoyable experience for me and the way these quirks are used during the battle sequences was also very nice. It gave off a sense of creativity. The way the show carries out its development and how it\u2019s all presented allowed me to enjoy the show for what it offered without paying too much mind to the many problems that it already had. Thus allowing me to even forget about those problems sometimes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion and Verdict:\\n\\n\r\nWhile Academia might not have been able to offer anything above the usual, it still fulfilled its job as a fun shounen. If you\u2019re looking for a nice little show to watch that doesn\u2019t take too much thinking or just want to enjoy something that\u2019s quick while giving out enough enjoyment to make you want to watch more, then Academia could tend to your needs quite well. But for those who\u2019ve already seen enough of the genre and are looking for something new to be had, then your time is better spent elsewhere.",

            "content": "First thing I  just feel the need to say, everyone who is saying this is like One Punch Man... sorry but THAT IS ABSOLUTE BS. Beyond the fact that they're both series with heroes and superpowers and that the character designs are are a little funky/quirky (haha pun intended), there is NOTHING SIMILAR. That's like saying Death Note and Bleach are similar series since they happen to both focus on shinigami as a supernatural element in a previously seemingly normal world and both MC are high schoolers. Bleh. No. Just no. Just needed to get that off my chest, since I feel like peoplemight watch this with the expectation that it's like One Punch Man, or might not watch it because they think it will be like it. It's not.\\n\\n\r\nSince I'm late to the party in watching this, rather than give yet another description of the plot like all the other reviews before mine, I'm just gonna say it straight:\\n\\n\r\nThis show suffers from a SERIOUS pacing issue. Every single episode, from the first to the last, feels like a forth to a half is filler. The story is dragged out beyond being dragged out. It doesn't work because for this first arc of the story, the plot is very simple and predictable and follows a typical shounen genre type plot with magical schools/superpowers we've seen dozens and dozens of times beforehand.\\n\\n\r\nYou can literally fast forward through a lot of it, and the characters will be doing the exact same exercise/dialogue topic/training, whatever, as minutes prior. And it's not complicated stuff, there's no amazing fight scenes or complex plot points to warrant such drawn out scenarios. Basically, it actually gets boring.\\n\\n\r\nI'm being repetitive, but it's just truthful, you can't drag out a show with such a simple story line. I feel like what happened in 13 episodes could have happened easily in half the time, and it still might have felt a little dragged out.\\n\\n\r\nI actually ended up reading the manga after, because I really like the whole superpower/magical school genre, (and it's rare to find one without the females being stupidly cliche weak/annoying idiots or overly sexualized characters only being placed for fan service. Kudos to the author for that.) The manga is bounds and leaps better than the anime, and after reading it I can see WHY people rate this show so highly. If you're a fan of the manga, seeing the characters you like come to life, and knowing the cool storyline that unfolds afterwards, is really awesome and exciting. But as an anime on it's own, if you're not already a fan, it's just alright.\\n\\n\r\nThe show gives off that same feel that Naruto filler episodes do: the creators are trying to milk it for everything it's worth to make as much money as possible. I don't blame them, since it's a business, but it could've been an amazing show. As it is, it's just sort of good. I wouldn't be disappointed if it's discontinued, but I would still be sort of interested to see if it gets better in the next season, giving how well I like the manga. That sort of feel.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up,  to just rate this show based on its merits as a stand alone anime, it barely receives a passing grade.",

            "content": "Seeing the hype of My Hero Academia, I have the general impression that people watch it with the mindset as just another enjoyable fighting shounen with a unique-looking superhero premise. The production values are decent, the atmosphere is fitting for the superhero premise, and the story of a Quirkless individual really gives off that empowerment vibes. However, I like to try to dig beneath the surface. This review is mainly focused on the premise of the show and how it\u2019s possibly flawed upon closer inspection. \r\n\tFirst, we get a setting where having superpowers is a normality. How come heroism still thrives in this kind ofsetting? Factors such as the existence of Quirkless people, powers being inferior to others, and the inevitable division between bad and evil are all reasons why. Yet, these reasons could have been used more properly to have a better story in terms of conflict and exploration. The existence of Quirkless people serves as a way for discrimination to thrive into the story, without having any pre-existing remedies to compensate for their absence of Quirks. Inferior powers are also a way for discrimination to be present in the story, but powers could be used in other aspects of life apart from fighting like industry and transportation. The division between bad and good hasn\u2019t been properly explained by the story so far but the impression I get is that it\u2019s biased on one side (Justice always wins). I\u2019m hoping the second season will try to expand on this aspect. \\n\\n\r\n\tSecond, the story takes place in an academy for aspiring heroes. Does it really need to be necessary to enroll in an academy to be qualified a hero? Apart from the main cast being kids which means there must be a sort of school, there is no real reason. There is an organization of heroes in general but having an academy that is modelled after an ordinary school with stuff like English class feel pointless. Powers varies by person and you can\u2019t simply measure their capability through a set of tests following a common guideline. Sure, you can polish things like preparedness, mentality, and utilization of powers but they mostly lie on the theoretical side. How will they train their powers if there is no such thing as an academy? Things such as self-training or discipleship work.  Based from what I observed, the main drive for the cast is to have their powers recognized by the crowd and not the noble idea of helping others unconditionally like All Might does. The original meaning of heroism gets twisted. It can make an interesting deconstruction but it doesn\u2019t look that way based on what we are shown thus far.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe story is fairly average as a shounen title but with the attention-grabbing superhero premise. The main cast are not really that interesting and lack the charm to be an interesting hero. They could use better characterization to look less generic and more character background to reinforce their standing and future development as a character in the story. Overall, it has an interesting premise but it\u2019s not being fully utilized by the story. It has a strong start, but it starts to lose steam as it side-tracks into the less interesting parts of the story. The enjoyment is there, with a couple of frustrations along the way, but it could have used its episodes better. But hey, we still have another season and just maybe it might resolve some of the problems I have in the show. For now, it\u2019s just fine as a mindless yet enjoyable and engaging superhero story but not really as amazing as I expected it to be.\\n",

            "content": "My Hero Academia was easily the most hyped show this season for me, and for good reason. Once I heard that it was going to be produced by Bones, my anticipation went through the roof because of the obligatory Full Metal Alchemist comparisons. What I got was not FMA, nor should it have been. My Hero Academia is an endearing and uplifting tale of a young boy trying to get accepted into an academy full of individuals with superpowers (which he ironically has none of). It's almost like an anime based on Xmen. It ends up suffering a tad from groundhogs day disease and plotconveniences, and the overall premise wasn't exactly what I originally foresaw. However, a great potential and the last three episodes certainly made the series for me, giving me something to look forward to in the newly announced season two.\\n\\n\r\nThere's that popular saying in life that everything is good in moderation, and I found that that's one of the areas that Academia struggles.  The first episode was rather enjoyable and I really felt moved and gripped by Midoriya's motivating personality.  The way he admired the other heroes and envied their ability to save those in need struck some heart chords with me that I really can't explain. A lot of shows start off with this underwhelmingly weak protagonist but something about Midoriya seemed more relatable. In a way he kind of reminded me of myself because of his brains over brawn mentality, even if it is was technically forced upon him due to natural selection. Unfortunately, the \"I can do it!\" theme from the first episode repeated a multitude of times afterwards. It almost felt as though I was watching the same episode over and over again with a different background. This was the point in the show when I realized how lofty my expectations may have initially been.\\n\\n\r\nI chuckled at the convenient nature in which Midoriya receives his perk. I guess in his case persistence really does pay off. All Might almost appeared to be swatting away a fly when he was initially dismissive of Midoriya. Convenience aside, I was relieved to see that the power given to him was not magically mastered in a minute. Perseverance and willpower were the keys to making this perk work. Using this new power Midoriya grows tremendously as a character. Through this growth he even inadvertently manages to spark a sense of jealousy in his rival Kacchan's eyes.  toll that the All Might ability had on his body was proof of its potency. The manner in which Midoriya's fellow students revered him after saving Uraraka was a prime example of the naivety of youth. The other adults teaching the classes knew something was up, but his peers change their minds rather quickly when they saw the impact of his perk. I'm just glad an anime writer finally illustrated how gullible kids can be vice making them into a reincarnated Sherlock Holmes in the form of a 14-year-old. I appreciated the sense of realism written into the characters which was shown quite well in the evacuation scene, where mass chaos ensued when the threat of a security breach within the school loomed.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect of Academia I enjoyed was the comedy. Sometimes anime can entirely derail due to poorly written comedy. Unintentionally deadpan humor that falls on deaf ears can be cringe worthy. There were even shows this season guilty of such atrocities in dialogue. Academia's jokes were well written, subtle and well-placed within its 13 jampacked episodes. I even found myself laughing out loud during a couple of instances. Something about Midoriya's character is so pathetic you can't help but laugh at him from time to time.  At the same token, the story can have very uplifting moments, and the tides can turn quite quickly into serious, cerebral battles. Pacing can be a slight issue due to the development of the characters, environment and plot. With the potential to be a repeating series, at times Academia struggled to keep me focused due to the sheer amount of things it was trying to get done in such a short amount of episodes. Despite this and the aforementioned groundhog effect, Academia kept me entertained and intrigued enough to look forward to its second installment in order to expand the story.  I was also elated to see how the show ended, another aspect that made me look forward to future seasons. The series took a dark turn in the concluding episodes, showing the heroes in a vulnerable state, something not shown in many anime/television shows. You can really feel the panic in Midoriya and his friend's voices, realizing that being a hero isn't all about glory and morality... There can be quite a grim side as well.\\n\\n\r\nObviously the character development in Academia primarily revolves around our main protagonist Midoriya. I can be slightly empathetic to his childhood as I also got made fun of and ridiculed for my shortcomings when I was younger. I do like the approach the writers gave to Midoriya's backstory, making it seem like a tale of redemption more than a sob story. Although meek and timid l, Midoriya shows promise as a MC from his determination and intellect. Although his goals are lofty, he is still just a boy who is shy and nervous around girls, and gets worked up over relatively trivial matters. His interactions with Kacchan are very believable in the sense that he sees himself at level ground once his perk is obtained. His rival, someone that he's looked up to and envied for his entire life has now been knocked down a peg and has become vulnerable. The Herculean growth he goes through in the series is awe-inspiring. Kacchan doesn't necessarily receive the same amount of growth or character development, but he isn't entirely ignored. His past is slightly explored through character flashbacks and some inner monolguing, but it didn't quite cut the mustard for me. I wanted to know more about what made his mind works the way it did and why he was always so pissed off at Midoriya. I felt like there was a lot more emotion possibly smokescreened beneath it all. \\n\\n\r\nBesides Kacchan and Midoriya, the only other character worthy of any development was All Might. His facade he showcased in hero form was taking a massive toll on his body.  Passing the torch was inevitable, but he struggled internally with doing so.  I think he may have been my favorite character in the whole series. There was just a brute sense of realism in his actions. I know that this character development problem stems from the fact that the series is only 13 episodes but that doesn't make it not a problem. I know that risk and budgeting issues limit most anime seasons from being longer than about a dozen episodes, but it doesn't give me a real chance to become connected to a cast the size of a show like Academia. I couldn't even remember half of their names when the show is over. I know this isn't a problem directly linked to Academia, but it's frustrating nonetheless. The villain who appeared at the end showed some promise so, I guess I'll have to wait till next season to see his character more developed.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no denying that the music and art in Academia are top notch and I would expect nothing less from bones. The opening is one of my favorites this season, with its quick beat and intense animation. I actually found it on a 10 hour loop within a couple days of its premiere on YouTube. There are no miss use of sound effects or bad voice acting. Both Midoriya and All Might's voice actors put on tremendous shows of versatility in their roles. The ED's a cute little childish bow on each episode as if to remind you that you're watching a cartoon, in case you forgot. Nothing really special here. I really like the art style in academia, everything looked fluid and seamless... and its budget was on display here.  Beautiful fight scenes galore, it was certainly visually stimulating. I thought it was interesting how both shows produced by Bones this season (Academia and Bunguo Stray Dogs) each had such vivid and discernible art styles.\\n\\n\r\nMy Hero Academia was no FMAB reincarnation, but was easily entertaining in its own right.  Through its use of eye-catching visuals and inspirational story, there is something for everyone in this series.  I am anxiously awaiting the second season to discover what happens to Midoriya and his friends at the Hero Academy.  I guess only time will tell how great of a franchise this becomes, but I would recommend it to anyone.  If you're looking for some quality action and entertainment without too much strain on the intellectual side, this is an anime for you.

            "content": "[Spoilers from episode 1]\r\nI don't find the Boku no Hero series good nor bad, simply mediocre. Mediocre and generic are the most fitting words I can find to describe this show. It's like the author took all the basics of an average shonen manga and put them together hoping it would work, and it seems like it worked. Boku no Hero is one of the most overrated animes out there.\r\nWe can begin with the story. I have to say the plot didn't have much potential from the very start. The concept was poor (good heroes fighting bad villains) so you can't expect much of theexecution. However, when I found out in ep. 1 that the main protagonist was heavily disadvantaged (being part of the 20% of the population that does not have super-powers) I started increasing my hopes. I though this particular shonen protagonist actually wouldn't follow the clich\u00e9s and find a way to become even stronger than people with powers without possessing one, some sort of humanism like in Fullmetal Alchemist about humans' true nature, infinite potential, and ability to never cease to hope, but nope: the world's strongest hero hands him down his OP power that he is throughout the plot going to gradually control (another clich\u00e8). That \"oh, he risked his own life to save someone he didn't even know so he deserves that power\" seemed to me just a cheap pretest to return to the clich\u00e8 trail. I still find the story decent but seriously not more than that. Story rating: 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is great. Studio Bones really did a good job making the animation fluid and impactful in relatable way (that's what you call great choreography). I didn't really like the art style though, but I guess that's just based on my subjective perspective of beautiful art. Rating: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, I didn't really find anything special with the soundtracks, it's simply fine. Fitting, but still mediocre. I tried the original soundtrack album and I genuinely liked a few tracks. The openings and endings are ok. Sound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nWe finally come to characters. I personally find that the characters are the worst part of the series. The only round characters in the whole S1 and S2 are All Might and Todoroki (oh, and that purple -haired guy that control minds). I have serious difficulties in appreciating Deku's character. His \"genericness\" is simply annoying: the naive and bighearted but strong hero that fights against evil and to achieve his dream of becoming the strongest hero. I was so uninterested I didn't even want him to win when he was fighting, and that is, for a main character, not a good thing. The other characters are just as clich\u00e8: the big, good, naive nerd, the friendly (naive as well) girl, the cold-blooded badass, the Kakashi-ish fan service character, the impulsive, warm-blooded rude guy that is intrinsically nice and finally the protagonist's mentor, the one Deku desires to become. I have seen every single one of these character types in other animes of movies. The characters could hardly get more uninteresting, poor and unoriginal. Characters: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment, it was enough good to make me complete S1 and half of S2, but rarely enough good to excite me and actually make me even speculate about what is going to happen next. Enjoyment/entertainment: 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nAs sad before, I find Boku no Hero simply average, not fine but not bad. The animation's greatness cannot be denied, but I feel like this manga didn't deserve such a great adaptation (I'm still talking about the animation). I really can't understand how it could get so popular. Overall rating: 5/10.",

            "content": "My Hero Academia is regularly billed as \"The New One Piece\" or \"The New Naruto\". There's certainly some truth to that - even setting aside meta comparisons like its status as Jump's new cash cow, it clearly draws inspiration from both, with its distinctive cartoony character designs and action scenes owing much to One Piece, and its school setting and ensemble cast resembling early Naruto.\r\nBut the important thing is what's new.\r\nIt'd be easy to dismiss Hero Academia as another soulless clone of its predecessors (and there really are so many), but in some respects HeroAca marks a progression from usual genre conventions. The first andforemost example of this is in the protagonist, Izuku \"Deku\" Midoriya.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest and most frequent problems with battle shonen protagonists is in the origin of their powers. Goku, Naruto, Ichigo, Yusuke, and many other such protagonists are all born special. The growth of these characters and their abilities ultimately breaks down to unlocking a series of contrived powerups.\\n\\n\r\nDeku, however, is born powerless (which in the setting of HeroAca is quite unique). But as he idolizes heroes - especially All Might, who is considered the world's greatest hero - he devotes his life to the study of heroes' abilities. Perhaps because of this, Deku develops the virtues key to being a great hero, is recognized for this by All Might himself, and is granted powers of his own.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of Hero Academia's strengths - there's an emphasis placed, not just on becoming the strongest hero, but on becoming the *greatest* hero. On what it means to be heroic. HeroAca is a series about character growth, but it's about their growth as people as much as their growth in skill.\\n\\n\r\nThe battle system also benefits from this, as their powers (or \"Quirks\" are they are known) are always simply what they are. While Deku's increasing ability is a core part of the plot, the roof on his power level is set from day 1. His progression is only him learning to use it. This keeps the series grounded, ensuring it doesn't devolve into a string of powerups. Better still, every step taken to gain control of his abilities is logical and earned - there's no deus ex machina at work here.\\n\\n\r\nThat we're able to empathize with each step of his journey keeps us invested in Deku, which is the core of why this series works. The contrast of virtues also makes for an interesting and colourful supporting cast. each with their own reasons for becoming heroes. This is helped by some exceptionally distinct character designs courtesy of mangaka Horikoshi Kouhei's unique sense of style and aesthetic. There's no mistaking HeroAca for any other anime.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, while all this applies to Hero Academia as a series, both to the manga and later instalments of the anime, to speak solely of this particular season of the anime, it suffers from being a 13-episode season. Not only is this season absurdly slow-paced compared to the source material (most likely as an attempt to neatly end with a complete story arc), but it ultimately leads to a lack of actual content. As a result, there are alarmingly few hot-blooded beat-the-shit-out-of-each-other fight scenes, considering that these are practically mandatory for this genre.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, My Hero Academia is a prelude for things to come. It's the beginning of a long story. The first act. It's a very solid foundation to build a great series on, but that is all it is - a foundation. HeroAca is definitely a good show and worth watching, but it is only the tip of the iceberg.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 5/10\\n\r\nAnimation/Graphics: 8/10\\n\r\nMusic/Background: 7/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: One Piece, Naruto",

You follow this friendless wimpy little brat that can't fight but wants to become the most powerful fighter in their place of residence. And they don't really make any meaningful jump in power until they meet an overpowered old man (Hokaga = super hero. Toad sage= allmight) But that's where the similarities end. Unlike midoriya, Naruto worked for the shit he got and when he failed he triedagain that made him endearing... \\n\\n\r\n Midoriya just cried for an episode or two until someone handed him powers.\\n\\n\r\nwhat I'm  trying to say is midoriya is one of the many things that ruined this anime for me. He's an entitled brat that any sensible person would want to smack in the face immediately after getting to know them.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem with the anime is the quirk system...It's close to the devil fruit abilities  in one piece but it's shit. Every character has a unique ability in Hero Academia but none of them are fixable. While devil fruit had a high level of adaptability quirks do not. The second you know someones power they'll never gonna have any other tricks up their sleeves. Because of this  Most fights are well animated but boring.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all one dimensional and forgettable.

            "content": "Review #3 - My Hero Academia (2016)\r\nThe objective of this review is show a different point of view of this show,excluding all the hype and good production and focusing in it's story and characters.\r\nThe first problem of this show is that is too much similar to Naruto. People already know that Kouhei Horikoshi is a big fan of the Naruto series,and it's pretty normal to have inspirations in a work of art,at least when it's did by the good way. The beginning is like watching Naruto all over again,bullied main character that doesn't have powers(like Naruto who can't do any jutsu in the first episodes.)MC also does have a dream(this is the biggest problem of Modern Shounen) of being the greatest hero like Naruto who wants to be the greatest ninja of his village(The Hokage.) There's a lot of examples of shows that did a nice use of inspirations in universe-building (JOJO NO KIMYOU NA BOUKEN,who took Hokuto Shinken from HOKUTO NO KEN as the main idea for ramon,which later as replaced by the Stands,BLEACH took the sanctuary and gold saints from SAINT SEIYA to create Soul Society and the Shinigami captains.) But these shows doesn't look like you're watching another show all over again.\\n\\n\r\nI don't have problems with similar introductions showing inspirations from other works,if it develops in something different and decent in the future,MHA isn't doing it. Also,I didn't watched S3,if something gets better from the arc it adaptates,I can't tell about them,since I didn't watched it.\\n\\n\r\nThe second problem: the notion of space. All the whole story happens on JAPAN ONLY!!!! Something universal like super-heroes should been worked with one international perspective. Horikoshi is being lazy in focusing his work in heroes from one country only. (I don't know if this was changed in manga,because I don't read it.)\\n\\n\r\nThe third problem(this is a critic not for MHA only but to the whole Modern Shounen at all.): There isn't no innovations on it. Just background changing,in Naruto we have ninjas,in this we have super-heroes,in Naruto we have jutsus,in MHA we have quirks(the only difference in this point is that each characters have at least two jutsus,in HERO ACADEMIA each character have one quirk. In Naruto, we have child which dream in doing the best they can do,the same in MHA.\\n\\n\r\nIn the End,this is more of the same. It is a great show if you want to replace Naruto's hype,since Boruto can't do it. I have to admit BONES is doing a good work on animation and soundtrack,but people must understand one thing,ART can't buy someone who is interested in plot and well-done-human-like-multidimensional characters like me.\\n\\n\r\nSorry if this text have some grammar errors,I'm not a native speaker/writer.",

            "content": "My Hero Academia is one of the latest fads among the anime community with its rating being 8.45 at the time I'm writing this. However, before watching a new show, my expectations are set to a bare minimum in order not to be disappointed. Naturally, I went in for MHA with the same mindset.\r\nIn a nutshell, MHA is a shounen anime, where shounen characters do shounen things... Indeed. There's nothing more to it.\r\nThe story follows Midoriya, a 14-year-old who wants to be hero, but has no quirk. Quirks are supernatural powers which, for some reason, most people have, around 80% of the population. I'll getback to the Quirks a bit later.\\n\r\nMidoriya is often being ridiculed by his peers for being quirkless, especially by his childhood \"friend\" Bakugo. Yet, Midoriya doesn't give up, being the shounen lead he his, and stays true to his dream and insists on enrolling at the UA, the most famous high school for future heroes. One day, while going home, he was attacked by a villain (yes, the villains call themselves villains, or should I say BIRANUSU) where he was saved by his favorite hero, All Might. Things happened, I don't want to retell the first episode for you, but All Might decides that it would be a good idea to choose a fragile, quirkless boy as his successor and starts training him for the entrance exam the following year.\\n\r\nThe story is divided into a couple of \"mini-arcs\", each lasting from three to four episodes. They are action-packed, but nothing important actually happens towards the end. Other than the students' daily life, and the little incident in the final arc, there was nothing, which could be a blessing in disguise. Unlike some other shows, it doesn't pretend to be \"dark\" and thankfully, I don't see it ending up as an edgy show for angsty teenagers like Tokyo Ghoul for example. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the most important aspects for me are the characters. Well, the thing is, MHA's are either disagreeable or as generic as they get. There are so many of them, and most of them had so little screen time that even the girl's from AAST (Mars of Destruction) character can be more elaborated on. The main character, other than being untalented, is a huge hero fanboy and collects all possible information about them. He is socially awkward, especially around girls, and the way he reacts when a girl talks to him for the first time is supposed to be funny, if the joke wasn't centuries old. The show tries too hard to make us feel for him and he gets bullied whatever he does, up to the point where it gets annoying. The writer could be a fan of Liverpool Football Club, I guess...\\n\r\nHis \"friend\" Bakugo, is a special snowflake. Is he even his friend? His character can be described in one word - angry. Cause that's the only thing he is. Only yelling, shouting at other characters, venting his inborn frustration on Midoriya, threatening to murder him, because Midoriya somehow ruined his plans by wanting to become a hero. His quirk is flashy as he's able to create fire, he's skilled, and he believes that because of it he has the right to be a selfish, conceited, obnoxious plonker. I really have no clue how anyone can like this guy, I wish someone would give him a good beating. Still, it seems as if he realizes slowly that the world doesn't revolve around him and sees that there are heroes who are more powerful than him, which could imply character development.\\n\r\nAll Might is, at least in the public eye, the greatest hero of all, a symbol of peace and the embodiment of valor, strength and justice. He does a secret that the public mustn't find out, which is why he keeps fighting villains with a smile, and lectures Midoriya on how to be a proper hero. The rest of the cast isn't that memorable. It includes Uraraka, a cute girl who is a friend of the main character (possibly a love interest later on), Iida, that rich guy with glasses who is a teacher's pet and who becomes the class president, a frog girl, a gay dude who speaks French randomly (why do most gay guys in anime speak French?), another useless whiny kid who resembles Lambo from Hitaman Reborn, a John Cena girl because you can't see her (she literally is invisible) etc. I couldn't be bothered to remember their names, too many of them, too few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAs for their Quirks, I don't find them to be too creative or interesting. I thought they were pretty dull to be honest, considering that the author can make up anything he wants. We have various types of enforcers, a lad who goes Pikachu and shocks everyone near him, a guy who can control the temperature of his surroundings, a girl who can make things float, a chap who has exhaust pipes in his calves which makes him extremely fast, a guy who shoots fancy laser beams from his belly and so on. I still wonder how Mineta, the whiny kid I've mentioned, whose only power is his \"sticky hair\" got into the academy...\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are ugly, as if Hitman Reborn and Fairy Tail had a child, so it may take some time getting used to it. The whole style leaves an Americanized vibe, which is surely something hardcore Japan fans won't approve of. The animation is pretty fluid and the battles are flashy with lots of explosions, as expected. \\n\r\nThe OST is solid, and the opening theme is excellent. There are a few songs used during the battles which I would like to find, but the OST is not out yet. Most of the voice actors are well-known and easy to recognize.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, My Hero Academia is a pretty average shounen anime which doesn't stand out at anything it does, and to be fair, it doesn't attempt to stand out. I wasn't really bored, but I was never too entertained either. Sure, the action is flashy, but that's it, the characters are boring, the abilities they have aren't  interesting, the battles have so far been based on their power levels, and if you've seen at least one shounen anime in your life, the attempts of humor won't make you giggle, let alone laugh.\\n\r\nIf you are new to anime, a diehard fan of the genre or just looking to pass the time with something that doesn't require your thinking, you will most likely enjoy it. If you are not, I'm absolutely positive that you can find something better to do.",

Yo get back here! You better be scared cuz mah quirk is a gun! Yeah that's right fool, back off.\r\nYou might be thinking: \"Hey its gotta be one of those generic shonen again, I ain't got time fo that.\" You might be just too far off right there. Boku no hero academia is quite unique, for the first season I guess, it doesn't really follow the overused clich\u00e9 that is being seen in every shonen, theformula would always be the main protagonist starts off weak, and then just becomes the most overpowered thing ever, that's not the case here though. From the start to the end of the first season, the show was able to maintain the concentration of the cast within the show and it doesn't just cut them off one by one too. The 'Power' of the main protagonist is also maintained throughout the show, *SPOILERS* even in the end, he was not shown off as the most piece of unkillable trash like most shonen always falls into, making Boku no hero Academia a slightly different shonen in terms of formula.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is linear just like all the shonen you've seen, that's right it's the, \"I wanna become the very best!\" clich\u00e9, but that's ok, because everyone wants to be the best too, kind of overused but relatable, especially if you're in a world where superpowers can be obtained that easily. The Artstyle is nice, it has that superhero comic visual going on which is very fitting, and the animations were done very well, it looks very smooth. The music I must say, such beautiful opening, a fresh change of pace of melody within the anime industry, probably one of the anime openings that I never skipped. \\n\\n\r\nFinally the characters, now this is where most shonen have failed, a few succeed to not neglect this category, and one of them is Boku no hero academia, imagine you write like 10-20 bunch of characters, and all of them have different personalities, different ambitions, different minds, and now add different superpowers into the mix, with conditions, executions and flashy animations, that might hurt your head a bit, especially if you're doing a whole series focusing on every one of them.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few flaws I found in this anime, one of it is the overdramatic protagonist, like seriously, if you give him a waterproof sack, he's gonna be fillin it up in an hour or so just by his obnoxious crying. Secondly, I do not like how the pacing feel throughout the entire season, I guarantee you there are fillers in there, like *SPOILERS* near the end, it was so frustrating how sometimes an episode gives you barely nothing new than what was presented in the previous one, Whenever I was about to get into an episode, and then the ending starts rolling in, I'm like, \"No, no no, that can't be it! What happens next!?\" Either that, or i'm just too enjoying it, and it never felt enough.\\n\\n\r\nI must say, Boku no hero academia might just be the dark horse of the Shonen genre of the season, and I will look forward to finishing the second season, and even judging it from a stagnant perspective, I for sure knew it would get a season 2 because of how short the first season felt like. \\n\\n\r\nAnd dahell was with All might's moves? Frickin cringey American punches, I mean seriously? Detroit Smash?? Oh wait, that's really funny and ironic actually.... P.S: Invisigirl best waifu!",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nIn less than a year we got two amazing anime's that defined the superhero genre One Punch Man and My Hero Academia, but Hero Academia decides to go a different route that makes it just as good as OPM.\r\nThe story is set in a world where 80% of the human population have different superpowers called Quirks, Izuku Midoriya want's to be a hero just like his idol All Might, but he was born without a Quirk until he unexpectedly encounters All Might himself where he discovers a secret that begins his journey of being a Hero.\r\nWhat I really love about the story ispretty much the whole premise because watching just felt like if Marvel and DC had a baby and this is what we got which is goddamn amazing and it truly shows you what it means to be a hero and seeing Midoriya along with his other superpowered friends learn what it takes to be a hero was definitely an entertaining ride as the situations they encountered when testing out their quirks and even encountering villains would show what they are really capable of.\\n\r\nThe biggest part of the story is seeing the mentor/student relationship between Midoriya and All Might as All Might has chosen him to be his successor for his power it showed a very respectable and trustworthy relationship between the two as Midoriya would listen for what is required to make sure his body can withstand the effects of the power while All Might makes sure he doesn't push himself to the point where it'll hurt him further and Midoriya also reminded All Might what it means to be a true hero as his admiration towards him and the people around relit the spark he had lost.\\n\r\nI liked how it also focused on Midoriya's relationships with some of the other hero's who all thought he was useless to begin with, but after seeing some the actions he made their respect for him did grow and his respect for them grew too even to the point where he would sacrifice himself for them, it was also interesting seeing the students learn how to use their quirks properly and how to work as a team which makes the bond between them slowly grow especially when they had to fight villains together which made them look like a very capable bunch even if they had been split into separate groups.\\n\\n\r\nNow there is a huge amount of characters in this show especially when it comes to the student hero's, but not all of them are probably worth mentioning since a few don't say that many lines.\\n\r\nIzuku Midoriya is the male MC and begins without a quirk until All Might gives him his own to him, Midoriya usually screams or whimpers a lot which might annoy people, but it makes sense since he has been surrounded and bullied by quirk users like Bakugo until recently and despite this he is actually a brave person willing to make snap decisions in the case if someone is in danger which has saved a few characters lives to be honest, he is a determined, honest and kind-hearted person as his dream is to be a hero so he can protect everyone which seems like a very good reason to like the guy plus he has studied every superhero's powers meaning in combat he can be very strategic and helpful when fighting enemies even when he can't use his quite often.   \\n\r\nAll Might is the No.1 hero and is known as the symbol of Peace along being Midoriya's mentor, he has two forms to him his hero form and his true form as he sustained an injury that has been making him use his powers less and less which is why he has been looking for a replacement, at first he seems like a cool guy who would never be afraid of a fight, but really he is always afraid and has lost sight if what it means to be a hero until Midoriya shows him that meaning again which is why he chose Midoriya, he can be a very over the top guy though he is very protective and takes matters very seriously if the situation might end up with people getting hurt.\\n\r\nKatsuki Bakugo is Midoriya's rival in some case and has the quirk explosion, I honestly do not like him to some extent because he starts out as an overconfident, selfish and very egotistical idiot and he is always angry no matter what, he always makes everyone seem below him especially Midoriya because he has no quirk yet he still wants to be a hero which really annoys him, but his character does get slightly better by the end since he encounters other people who have powers better than his and the fight he has with Midoriya starts to make him open his eyes more, but he still remains an angry jerk.\\n\r\nOchako Uraraka is a female student at the academy and her quirk is zero gravity, she becomes Midoriya's friend very quickly since he saved her life during the entrance exam, she is a very kind and sweet person since she was willing to give Midoriya some of her points after he saved her life, she is often making sure her friends are ok as long she isn't suffering herself since using her powers often does make her sick.\\n\r\nTenya Iida is a male student who is part of a respectable superhero family and his quirk is engine, at first he looks scary, but he is a very honest and strict person since he takes being a hero very seriously and he did underestimate Midoriya until he sacrificed himself to save Uraraka during the entrance exam which then made him respect Midoriya more and became a good friend of his, he eventually becomes the class president because Midoriya believe's he is a good leader.\\n\r\nTsuyu Asui is another female student who has the quirk frog which is literally frog powers, her personality may look plain, but she is actually a protective, sharp and intelligent person since she was the first who noticed how similar Midoriya's and All Might's quirks were.\\n\r\nShouta Aizawa is another teacher at the academy whose quirk is Erasure, he is a very cold and apathetic teacher and even said that whoever came last during practise would be expelled and he didn't see the potential in Midoriya until he showed Aizawa that he could control his powers in some way,but he does care about his students and even risked his life to protect them when the villains attacked them.\\n\r\nMinoru Mineta is the smallest student at the academy and his quirk is pop off, he is shown to be a pretty perverted and joker like, but he doesn't do well during battles as he went into a crying fit when the villains attacked until Midoriya gave him the courage to fight back.\\n\r\nMomo Yaoyorozu is another female student at the academy whose quirk is creation, she has incredible analytic skills as she deduced why Midoriya and Uraraka didn't do a good job against Bakugo and Tenya in their training battle making her a very intelligent and calm member of the team and despite appearing blunt she just wants to make sure her friends become great heroes.\\n\r\nShouto Todoroki is a male student who was recommended for the  academy since his quirk has the power to control both cold and hot temperatures, he isn't shown much as he mainly keeps to himself, but he is very deductive often trying to figure out things that seem mysterious like when the villains attacked the students and he froze some to find answers.\\n\r\nI know there are other characters who made some kind of impression, but the others that I haven't mentioned there isn't much to talk about them even though some like Mina, Eijirou, Fumikage and Tooru seem like very interesting characters, but with the amount of characters in this show that make up one class it would be difficult to give any of them screentime especially when Tooru is completely invisible which be difficult to make her a well known character since you always keep forgetting her, but the students in this class all seem like interesting characters that have something waiting for us to see.\\n\r\nOf course there is the villain too who is Tomura he is pretty much a psychopath who is bent on killing All Might, but even though he doesn't look prepared for a fight he shouldn't be messed with since he is very tactical and intelligent often evading a lot of attacks against him and his quirk allows him to make people slowly disintegrate making him a dangerous foe to get near, I thought he was pretty intimidating for a weak looking guy.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle looked really good and fitted the way the show was, I really liked the design's of the characters as they all seemed different which is always a good thing to me and it was even better how some of them didn't even look human which showed how extensive quirk powers could be, the costumes that the students wore were really good too which put some of Marvel and DC's superhero costumes in their place.\\n\r\nI also have to say that the soundtrack along with the op and ed was great, it was epic and always came in at the right time it made the show feel even more like a proper superhero show.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the variety of superpowers in this show and instead of being called superpowers they were given a name that was more befitting with how they come to be, the amount of different powers was also intriguing since each one seemed very cool despite looking like they are just a variation we have seen from Marvel and DC superheroes.\\n\\n\r\nThe action is this show was very exciting and were planned out very well because we don't see heroes and villains going at it with fists and furry we actually get to see some strategy and teamwork too as it was really interesting seeing the characters trying to evaluate a situation and seeing how effective their power would be against the enemy and whether they should attack them or avoid them as they don't know the enemies strengths too, but we also get to see the students fight each other which helped them show how well their powers would do in an actual battle and also brought some conflict about with certain characters too.\\n\\n\r\nThere was also a decent amount of comedy though not as much as I remembered don't get me wrong the jokes were funny, but this show was more serious than funny because there was a lot of moments between Midoriya and All Might that were pretty inspirational and somewhat sentimental too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a brilliant superhero anime and I can't wait for the second season to finish so i can binge on it and hopefully be completely amazed by it because this is definitely a show I wouldn't mind running for a good while since there are so many opportunities here.",

When I found out that Jon Favreau had given the rights to this series to a Japanese studio, I was surprised but not necessarily worried. I figured that Marvel wouldn\u2019t bestow the responsibility to uphold the very esteemed MCU to just anyone. I guess I was wrong to trust the anime industry to produce anything without the highest saturation of tropes possible. Boku no Hero Academia has reaffirmed my disdain for generic shounens. It basically jumps through every hoop required for your typical \u201cordinary kid inherits amazing power and tries tofit in with the rest of the Avengers and saves the day\u201d show. I felt like I was watching the conglomeration of everything I hate about anime for the teenage demographic. It was written so safe and close to the chest that there\u2019s no way it wouldn\u2019t be a success. I wish I was the executive who is getting paid for this commercially huge series so that I could continue to make cynical and colorful garbage which everyone would eat up like a god damn McDonald\u2019s taro pie. The only reason I finished this whole first season instead of stopping halfway is because I wanted to see if I was being too judgmental. Maybe it got crazy near the end and it would be ultimately worth it. I\u2019ve been proven wrong before, so I might as well be optimistic about one of the most popular anime ever. But I was fully disappointed this time, and the only thing I got out of watching it was this review. Thanks for nothing, Stan Lee.\\n\\n\r\n3/10 for sucking giant Hulk balls, but overall 6/10 because the doujins are pretty good.",

With a variety of friends who have watched the series or read the manga plus the fact that unlike some other shonen it is of actually reasonably watchable length. And so I picked it up recently.\r\nThe plot of My Hero Academia is pretty simple and straightforward, with main character Midoriya (or as some others refer to him as a nickname, Deku) being a person without superpowers (\"Quirkless\", with powers being known as Quirks) in a world full of them. Nonetheless heaspires to be a superhero and idolizes the top hero of the world, the all american All Might (seriously, his attacks are named after random states/cities in America, and it is hilariously great)! Midoriya is about to give up hopes on the possibility when a chance encounter with All Might leads to a series of events that leads to All Might deciding to pass on his Quirk to Midoriya as his successor, for his is a nearly unique quirk that can be passed on to others...and All Might's time as a hero is nearing its end.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the setup ends up rather standard, but the standout character of All Might helps push it along: All Might's pondering on how a career he built so much is coming to an end, passing it off to someone who he finds worthy for their morals over their power and struggling with how he has such a large instinct to help people when he no longer can as easily do and his thoughts on having an icon of justice are pretty much all the most interesting parts of the first season. Both of his designs are quite good, although I am surprisingly partial to his normal form, with his All Might costume and design looking like it jumped right out of an American comic book which also helps really establish the tone.\\n\\n\r\nMidoriya getting into the hero academy of the title leads to a host of side and semi-main characters with their own wacky powers and so on, although the first season primarily focuses on setting up for later seasons by introducing its quirky cast and what will obviously be recurring villains: About 3 of them are semi-mains who get focus as Midoriya's friend group, while the rest are relegated to more one note side characters for the moment. Some of them are really obviously going to be important in the future, Todoroki being the most obvious, while some are clearly just gag characters, like Yuuga or the awfil Mineta. In general, I would say a weakness of these characters is that the introduction of so many makes them quite one note at the start, even for the more prominent Ochako and Iida.\\n\\n\r\nBakugo, Midoriya's...\"friend\" from childhood and school who also got into the academy is the rival character of this show and a character I am iffy on. Quite frankly with how Bakugo interacts with Midoriya I have no idea how we are supposed to buy into the idea Bakugo and Midoriya are actually friends, with Bakugo telling Midoriya to kill himself, repeatedly threatening to kill him and blowing up his stuff. Yeah, sure, they were friends as kids, they repeatedly flash back to Midoriya and Bakugo at four years old with Midoriya getting messed up by him. And he still was friends with him for over a decade? Nobody's parents intervened or anything? It isn't like Bakugo is subtle. Yes, Midoriya does at times talk about Bakugo's flaws but those are for the most part glossed over. I simply can't buy into the idea of them as friends and the rivalry stemming from it seems odd. Bakugo is also pretty one note in the first season with the vast majority of his scenes either being \"superiority complex\" or \"explosions\".\\n\\n\r\nI am also going to take a moment of my time to say that Mineta, one of the minor heroes, is a truly terrible character in his limited screentime and should be kicked to the curb posthaste. He has two roles in this series: To be the one who makes pervy \"jokes\" + pervs on the girls and to be an overly loud, whiny \"hero\" who panics and is useless. These two traits combine to make a character who does nothing of value except unfunny jokes that often hurt the scenes he is in: His \"cowardly\" characterization in parts of the end of the season with Midoriya and Tsuyu stood out to me especially for hurting the atmosphere of the scene and lowering their quality notably. He also looks more like a child and his superhero outfit has what I would best describe as a diaper look to the pants, so you can tell this is just a parade of awfulness. Replacing Mineta's unfunny comedy antics in the finale's parts with an actual character to give us insight into them would have been a significantly better use of time than this waste of a character.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is fine for what it is, since most of it is setup and we do get some good All Might stuff. While the pace is solid, I feel it would have been perhaps better served paring down the cast a little and giving a touch more focus to the ones they did have. The appearance of the villains in this season are kind of out of nowhere, but it works well enough and sets them up for the future seasons (can I just make a minor complain it annoyed me that the one team predominantly headed up by the women students was the only one that didn't definitively beat their villains?).\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I have to talk about and it does make the pace feel off is that this show has waaaaaaaaaaaaay too many flashbacks. The Midoriya/Bakugo fight in particular has a multitude of flashbacks that beat the same point in, sometimes being flashbacks to the same thing earlieri nt he episode (I assume to bring to speed people who didn't see it due to tuning in mid-episode/after commercials?), that really end up taking you out of the scene and feeling rather jarring. Cutting down on these flashbacks and using them better, for example giving more to Ochako and Iida instead of all the Midoriya flashbacks, would improve the plot.\\n\\n\r\nGraphically, the show looks quite good: The characters are extremely expressive, All Might's unique shading really helps give pop to his character and make him look like a larger than life hero, the use of a lot of powers is well animated, I'm no expert in this kind of thing but I thought it overall looked pretty good. Sometimes though the faces really went too far, which either made them unpleasant or difficult to take seriously or otherwise kind of warped...I'm not sure how to put it, but sometimes it was too dramatic, other times it just looked funny. The VAing and sound is mostly solid: I may be the only person on the planet who doesn't especially care for MHA Season 1 or 2' OPs, but the background music is good but not something that jumped out to me. The voice acting is a bigger point in its favor, like Tsuyu, All Might and Bakugo's. Mineta's VAing was so good at playing the character's annoying traits to their appropriate annoyance that it only makes it easier to hate him.\\n\\n\r\nMy Hero Academia is not a shonen you watch because it is especially innovative, but it IS rather fun with enough to it to keep it from feeling vapid. Reviewing only the first season is awkward, and it is best to know going into this show that the first season is mostly there as a big introductory fest with the exception of All Might. I would generally recommend it to people who are predisposed to this kind of show given the strong visuals, enjoyment of fights and unique designs and the fact it has high potential to build on what it has made in the first season...but I also wouldn't say it super impressed me or that it is a show I would be especially trying to get people who aren't especially into this genre to watch for its quality. The primary thing it has is being enjoyable: The show is rarely dull and thus keeps the viewer invested.",

            "content": "I went into Boku no Hero Academia with the certainty that I'm gonna like it, and a lot at that, because I believed it resembled one of my favorite shows - Hunter x Hunter. The similarities I expected to see weren't in plot and characters, but in genre and more important, mood. Well, I was right.\r\nThe plot of BHA is the typical shounen underdog plot - the protagonist starts out weak and maybe goes through a defeat or two by his arch rival or another strong character, only to grow stronger in the course of the story and defeat them by the end of it.Done poorly, this type of story is predictable and doesn't provoke any emotions in the viewer. Done well, such a story is by no means less predictable, but it becomes strong and emotional as well. It all depends on the execution of the tropes.\\n\\n\r\nBoku no Hero Academia is on the emotional side - it manages to provoke the right emotions at the right moment and THAT's the reason why I compared it to Hunter x Hunter at the beginning - because the latter does the same. The emotions BHA provokes are definite, specific, and what is most important, strong. I've seen many shows that try to force emotions into the viewer, but to no avail. With the time I've come to realize that the reason why this is unsuccessful is the vagueness of the topic in question, the uncertainty and confusion of the scene/plot, so that in the end the viewer doesn't know what kind of emotion they should be feeling. Love? Hatred? Annoyance? Euphoria? Maybe the reason is that these shows try to provoke contradictory emotions at once, so that these emotions cancel one another. Or maybe they just don't dig deep enough into the characters' minds and explore their true feelings. Or they just try to be a bit too subtle about the emotions and spare them. BHA doesn't spare anything in regard to emotions.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect of the anime I liked was its pacing. BHA is a fast-paced show that doesn't waste episodes to set up the mood - because it can do this in the course of the story instead. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters in BHA, they might not be the most original ones in terms of personality, but they are interesting. The best part about the characters is that they are not overpowered and everyone possesses at least one major weakness. I've seen many anime shows with similar plots where everyone but the protagonist is shamelessly overpowered. Not only that, but the protagonists of such shows grow into the same or even stronger overpowered beasts as their enemies in very short a period. Which leads me to the next major asset of the characters in BHA, in this case the protagonist, Izuku - the acquiring of power. Izuku starts as quirkless, much to his dismay, only to later receive the Quirk of his favorite superhero. However, the means through which this happens differ from those in many other shows. Izuku is not gratuitously granted these powers. He has to work out to receive them - he has to deserve them. Not only that, but even after finally receiving them, he still can't make use of them without painful consequences. This places a natural limit to how strong a character can be and creates both plausibility and tension.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast each have their own charm. The best thing about them is that even when each of them represents a certain character archetype, they still have some quality that defines their personality as unique and belonging to only them.\\n\\n\r\nComing to the art, I found the character designs to be original and unforgettable, which is a plus. I watched the show in 720p, so the quality wasn't very good, but I still liked the animation, especially during the action sequences. Actually, the animation of BHA is one of its main assets. It further adds to the emotional appeal of the show, that is. I like shows with dynamic animation and BHA is one such show.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and music were nice as well. The OP and ED were energetic and in mood with the show and I downloaded them in the end (I just couldn't help it). The overall soundtrack was nice, too. The voice acting was good - I believe the VAs did a great job with each of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs for my enjoyment, I believe it's needless to say it was high. Shounen series usually have higher enjoyment rates than other types of shows (at least to me), but only the best of them can leave me with a long-term impression. If there was anything I didn't like about Boku no Hero Academia, it was its length - I wished it could go on longer. That's why I liked Hunter x Hunter - because it was good and entertained me for two long weeks, which felt like two days, to be honest. Anyway, I'm happy that a second season has been announced and I'll be looking forward to it. I might even rewatch the first season in 1080p if it's released before the second season.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Boku no Hero Academia is an excellent shounen series and I recommend it to all shounen fans. Even if you aren't a fan of shounen, you may still find the concept about superpowers interesting.",

            "content": "*ATTENTION*\r\nDo I have your attention now?...hehe\r\nBoku no Hero Academia is not like your every shounen anime. This (and One punch man) is kind of \"shounen gone american\" version, like the concept of superhero society spreading around which is(and I mean it) certainly not a bad thing. We all watch things for something new but once in a while who doesn't like combos (here bit american-japanese).\r\nIzuku Midoriya is your nerd with hell-lot of bravery who wants to become a hero no matter what. SO it's the story of the journey of this boy from being a zero to some ass-kicking-badass-'all-might'y hero......\r\nThe universe of My hero Academicais where everybody(almost) have some kind of power or quirk (in anime's terms), now according to their powers they become either heroes or live normally. Now Izuku (I think u already know) is our powerless but passionate wannabe hero, the emotions, the feelings that he carries are one of the +points and is beautifully portrayed. Every hero story needs a rival either in a form of enemy or friend-now here we have Bakugou who is one arrogant prick but yet overwhelmingly powerful, he my friends makes a great rival who is standing on the brink of the pit of evil held by Izuku from the other end. No matter which universe we go we all stay human, hence it is yet another saga of struggle against the odds. Ofcourse (you know) there is also an evil organisation at work who like any other one believes in extermination of all heroes and bring darkness, so what their plan is..>.>(don't worry not tellin) but they still have a big plan they need to execute...so now our Hero Academica will try and stop them..\\n\r\nSo let the game begin... \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation-9/10\\n\r\nAnimation is not 'WoW' but it is good, somewhat like in every other anime, it's pleasant to watch.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound/Voice Actors-9/10\\n\r\nMusic is good...OP is \"The Day\" by Porno Graffitti and ED is\"HEROES\" by Brian the Sun....Background music in important and fighting scene is badass,cool...Voice actors are good..I personally quite like Urakawa's voice done by Ayane sakane (She's super cute ...(~ ~))\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-8/10\\n\r\nIzuku is good earnest hero, Bakugou is your 'almost evil'-hero, Todoroki is your 'all powerful yet in pain' hero and many more interesting ones.I've read it's manga first and I think you can see a character more truthfully in it's original form, so what I can say is that the character don't have that much depth (but anyway when did shounen heroes had any depth...\u10da(o\u25e1o\u10da)\ufeff\ufeff) but still they do the task. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway it's a show with a great potential as Masashi Kishimoto said. I personally think it's a must watch as for seeing the sort-of changing trends in anime industry.\\n\r\nResult::GO AND WATCH IT and see for yourself, alrighty!!!!(Surely, worth a try)",

            "content": "I don't think this show is bad. It's alright. It just isn't made for me. It's aimed at a different audience. If I was still that fighting shounen hyped 12 year old I'd have probably loved this. Hell watching it makes me feel a bit nostalgic. But at this point it doesn't interest me at all. I find it mildly entertaining to watch with the friend that forced me to watch it simply because it's so easy to digest and I like seeing him get happy about it but I'd never really watch it out of my own accord unless I'm using it to learnmore Japanese. It's a stylistic choice I know, but I don't like the over the top cheesy tone and writing that I'm sort of supposed to take seriously. And I'm not that kid anymore who thinks ''WOAH THAT WAS SO BADASS'' with these scenes and love it on that alone. That's not to say I never like mindless or over the top entertainment, but this one isn't doing it for me.\\n\\n\r\nI think the people hyping it up are exaggerating like hell. A lot of the things they praise the show for aren't even in the show, it's all the shit outside of the show in the community that make things seem grander than they really are. On the other hand, I think the people hating on it are exaggerating and honestly, kind of petty. It's like bitching about how some saturday morning action cartoon for kids is shallow and cheesy. No shit. What you really got to ask is, is it well made and somewhat fun to watch if you take it for what it is? I'd say if it's your cup of tea, yes.  The animation and art is nice and actually looks quite unique. The sound makes things feel hype, even if I can't stand the constant screaming. The pacing is fast without everything feeling pointless. The plot and characters aren't good but it's enough to be memorable. \\n\\n\r\nNothing is special about Boku No Hero Academia. But it's basically a tighter, easier to digest, more polished version of a typical fighting shounen. That alone is appeal enough for a lot of people. It's like the people who buy some modern indie platformer that's almost the same thing as in the NES days but less cheap and more polished with the fat trimmed. \\n\\n\r\nI could talk about how it's basically just wish fullfiment material. I could try to criticise all the silly fighting shounen bullshit it pulls such as a complete lack of subtlety or all the cliches that were never all that good to begin with, as well as the lack of interesting plot and characters.. But they're serviceable enough for the type of show it is, and honestly the fact that it's shallow would be obvious. And That doesn't mean it has no merit or no things it does right. It's not like this is some trashy degenerate ecchi harem. It's a normal show. I encourage any normal or alternative/artsy show in anime. It's above average popcorn fun that happens to not fall in my taste. Sure, I can't praise it for that, but I can't condemn it either.",

Playing a true underdog story, you follow Midoria (a quirk less wannabe hero) who has no real power but dreams of becoming the greatest hero like his idol All Might. Midoria stands out due to his undeniable drive of \u2018Never give up, Never Surrender\u2019 attitude to protect and save people despite lacking powers. The struggle of Midoria for wanting to be a superhero and to only realize he has no powers is nicely displayed, fully grasping his motives ofdesperation and crushed dreams. You wholly sympathize with Midoria, who\u2019s a superhero nerd with a real superhero spirit, so you are just as emotionally invested and satisfied when his fate changes. All Might shares the same principles, coming across as an anime Superman though with some limitations! He has this bad habit of saving people at the cost of his health, constantly sacrificing himself by doing superhero actions. We know he has limited time so there\u2019s this constant air of concern whenever he\u2019s in action. The other characters are not well developed with the stand out being Midoria\u2019s explosive powered rival, Bakugou who plays more than just a typical male Tsundere. His future is unknown as the show hints him as a potential villain but he goes through his own character development. Coming to UA has his pride completely crushed at the hands of defeat from Midoria and the realization that he\u2019s not the best in his class, power nor intelligent wise. Since its only 13 episodes, too many characters get little screen time and their powers are only exhibited in the last 3 episodes. The same goes for the villains as well, barely introduced yet pertaining to an evil plan of a bigger magnitude.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEven though the art style is a tad bit childish, the character designs are very colourful, giving off the superhero vibe appropriately. The entire anime seems like it leapt out of the manga. Still the animation is weakly in some areas, either some character design would lose focus or the background will look incomplete. The facial expressions play in with the comedic light nature of the show while also delivering blood pumping, nonstop action when needed to. You won\u2019t find any dull action scenes as all of them will bring you to the edge of your seat regardless of knowing the end! \\n\\n\r\nThe Dub is wonderfully realized with great voice acting for Midoria and All Might. Lara Woodhull perfectly delivers the out of the box personality while Christopher Sabat totally commands All Might with his booming voice. The OP/ED are enjoyable to listen to especially the well-timed use of that one track whenever something epic is going to happen! \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall you will either love \u2018My Hero Academia\u2019 or you will find it a waste of time. It\u2019s unique style of art and great OST is mixed within a clich\u00e9d superhero story that manages to stand out despite its flaws! From showcasing the price to pay for being a superhero to the bond between All Might and Deku, the drama between Deku and Bakugou and the last 3 episodes epic Shounen action and comradery among the students sets Season 1 as an amazing and entertaining set up for the next Season! Totally recommend it and a perfect 10 for me due to its re-watchable factor!\\n",

Super heroes, the idea that one would purposefully use a supernatural trait for the betterment of others rather than personal conflicts and gain, have risen in prominence. As such, Boku no Hero Academia has had the good fortune of being a super hero anime during the genres hayday, and received wild praise and enjoyment all over the world.\r\nThe technical aspects of BHA certainly capitalize on traditional superhero themes. The soundtrack contains many over the top orinspirational songs to accompany action scenes, and never stands out to any great degree for dramatic effect. The music and sound serve their purpose, notable only for setting the tone for a larger than life story.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation also takes a few pointers from other cartoon-styled super hero works. While the series is certainly done in modern anime style, the movements of the characters take pointers from franchises like One Punch Man and some American productions. Non-action movements involve many cuts and panning or zooming with the shot angle. There is also the use of animation that is fluid but undefined, with arms and legs flailing or not making contact with the surface around them. It's a style that accompanied the genre well, making it feel like a super hero production rather than an anime with super powers.\\n\\n\r\nFocus for characters went for wide rather than deep with only 13 episodes for the first season. The main casts consists of about thirty characters, and while each one is given a personality and defining trait or two, few are delved into deeply. The main character, his mentor, and two or three of his classmates are the only ones to receive more attention, but what is shown has promise.\\n\\n\r\nEach character has goals and struggles, and none are completely invincible, so their respective weaknesses lend depth and methods to explore the motives of the cast, as well as the reasons for their personalities. Some stick a little unbelievably to certain character traits, even when faced with reason to change, but each one fills a clear role and does so well. Overall, the first season does a good job setting up a basis to interact with the whole cast, but has to focus time on engaging with the main story and main character, leaving side characters for later seasons.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of BNA delivers an excellent coming of age story that diverges nicely from many cliches and frustrations of other similar works. The \"hero\" is neither handed great strength nor overcomes all the odds despite an obvious weakness, but rather succeeds through training, effort, and growing into being strong. The cast has moments of both triumph and defeat, strength and weakness, hope and fear, but none are certain or persistent indefintiely. \\n\\n\r\nSince success wasn't guaranteed, moments of tension actually carried weight, rather having a lingering feeling that all would work out in favor of the protagonist. Sure there was a fair degree of \"and they/he arrived in the nick of time\" but all of the meantime was filled with action that made the future uncertain and powers that fought one another remained within their set parameters.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest praise for the BNA storyline comes in how consistent the powers of the characters remain through the whole run time. There are no sudden power ups, new abilities pulled from no where, or power of friendship. Instead, powers are clearly defined and limited.\\n\\n\r\nWhile some characters are seemingly more inherently powerful than others, greater importance is placed on how well one uses power rather than simple overwhelming force. A fun part of the series is seeing different powers interact or how seemingly niche powers can save the day.\\n\\n\r\nBoku no Hero Academia is certainly worth a look for many different reasons. The hero's story is a nice change from ones of sudden power increases or planning so precise it borders on impossible, or both if you're Shiba Tatsuya. The main cast sets a nice stage for coming installments and has a certain charm in being both capable, yet often challenged. The overall setting is also a fresh face in the medium of anime that, while similar to things like the Index franchise, certainly has put in the effort and time to make a clear setting and world for itself apart from other possible influences.",

            "content": "Out of 100 Nobles watching...\r\n90 Were impressed\r\n10 thought the use of flashback was hit or miss and slowed the action down\r\nBoku no Hero Academia is a Shonen anime adaptation of the Manga holding the same name. It takes place in a sort of X-Men like universe where humans are developing various powers except a lot of the powers are a little more silly than most Marvel mutants (looking at you tape elbow man) and in Boku no Hero something like 95% of the population has powers so it's kind of the opposite ratio to X-Men.\r\nBoku no Hero is a unique Shonen anime in that itadheres to almost every generic trope that Shonen media has to offer, but the way its characters are established as well as the setting being a kind of western comic book-esque \\n\r\nuniverse fits the feel perfectly and serves to benefit the story rather than play itself out and feel boring. \\n\r\n(Disclaimer; If you are an avid consumer of the genre than maybe you didn't feel this way.)\\n\\n\r\nAll that talk about adherence to tropes aside the main character Deku feels unique in that we are shown his struggle to better himself. He doesn't just GET to be amazing, but is instead forced to give it his all in an attempt just to compete with the rest of his peers. He does so in an extremely realistic way with an actual depicted rigorous change of diet,exercise, and lifestyle that inspired me to live healthier and shows that results require dedication.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters in the show are enjoyable with the typical love interest proving actually useful and just genuinely a delight of a character rather than a hollow shell. We get a good look into the mind of Bakugo our heroes rival and get an idea of what makes him tick. The supporting cast are for the most part all interesting and breed a lot of curiosity on what their powers are about and who they are as characters. Overall I was left wanting more of the world and the characters in it and when a show does that it's got you hooked for the long haul.  \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals in this show were amazing and I imagine it had an astronomically high budget, but even so it deserves mention that I can't recall seeing any CG. For an anime studio to not revert to cutting corners with CG especially with scene's involving lots of buildings and giant robots is fairly unheard of these days and will merit special recognition from me.\\n\\n\r\nBoku no Hero Academia has established itself as the perfect example of a Shonen story done well. It is as of now my prime example for its genre and will stand above its peers as long as it doesn't start to betray itself as the series goes on like many long running Shonen shows are prone to do.\\n\\n\r\nI came across Boku no Hero Academia post the hype of it's season as I was living under a rock at the time of it's airing so I feel my review is particularly unclouded by the hype it generated or the hate of said hype.\\n",

Midoryia despite not \r\nhaving any powers still wants to become a hero and triesto pursue it.\\n\\n\r\nThis series made me feel/cheer for a character(Midoryia) \\n\r\nquicker than any series in my entire lifetime of anime and manga, it literally\\n\r\nonly took 2 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nTHE CHOSEN ONE!\\n\r\nIn anime/manga, it takes time for you to care about the characters.\\n\r\nFor example, Luffy from One Piece, Naruto(9 tails), Edward from FMAB, Gintoki, Yato from Noragami,\\n\r\nOkabe from Steins;Gate, Lelouch from Code Geass, list goes on and on...\\n\r\npractically every single series takes you 10 episodes and or 20 chapters or longer for you \\n\r\nto care about the main characters. If any of the main characters die right near the beginning\\n\r\nyou'd probably shrug your shoulders and not give a shit, because quite frankly\\n\r\nthey ALL have that \"CHOSEN ONE\" trait. \\n\r\nThey're all good and or a natural at something\\n\r\nborn with some special skill or some hidden power or some destiny to fulfill or some\\n\r\ntrait that gets them a harem or some girl/guy suddenly protecting/taking a liking to them asap or they are born hot and good looking.\\n\r\nIt takes time for you to take a liking to these characters, to develop with them and start cheering for them because most likely\\n\r\nthey're better off than you are.\\n\r\nAs said earlier, Boku no Hero Academia made me cheer and feel for the main character straight off the bat very quick, which I will get into.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10:\\n\r\nMidoryia is not born with nothing. He isn't physically attractive, he doesn't have any powers, absolutely nothing.\\n\r\nI take that back.... he has BELOW nothing. He has a negative value of .. infinity.\\n\r\nHis body is pretty weak and fragile, his self confidence is tinier than an ant, the list goes on.\\n\r\nNot only is he below nothing but he's shoved to the ground.\\n\r\nHis doctor tells him to just give up his dream, he constantly gets laughed at by society, pushed around, beaten up.\\n\r\nI take it back, he isn't shoved into the ground... he's shoved into the Earths crust.\\n\r\nNo support from anyone, he smiles and sucks up the pain when getting laughed/beaten by society, doesn't fight back and cries, continues forward, and its sooo utterly painful to watch.\\n\r\nLike... come the fuck on, GIVE HIM.... JUST 1 TINY CHOSEN ONE ASPECT LISTED ABOVE FOR FRICKEN SAKE.\\n\r\nOne remarkable plot point that this character has is that anything and everything he will do and recieve in the future will and if not be 10000% EARNED.\\n\r\nOut of all the series I've watched so far, none of them start from below 0.\\n\r\nMidoriya has to work very very hard just to even touch 0 in this world. He earns everything he will get. Even more touching is that he'd probably go Saitama(One Punch Man) and be an unofficial hero if he loses his mind. This show sends the message that if you aren't the chosen one, take it and make it so you are.\\n\\n\r\nAside from Midoriya, rest of the characters are pretty cliched, not really much to say, hardly focused on them yet.\\n\\n\r\nAlso noted, there are HUGE battle flaws in every character which personally grounds the series to more realism\\n\r\n+1\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound 10/10\\n\r\nI give all series this score, as long as animation is consistent, and music matches the mood, I don't really care.\\n\r\nThese categories are way too subjective, hence I don't really bother.\\n\r\nThat noted, the music in this series BLOWS ME OUT OF THE WATER. Highly impactful emotional pieces.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nSeeing Midoriya go from -1000 to 0 and then hopefully proceeding higher in the future is what made everything enjoyable.\\n\r\nThe sound track matched so many scenes well, this series delivered a punch straight in the gut.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\n\"Cliche\" to some, but when you look at it more distantly, it blows your mind. Maybe it could be because it's so relatable.\\n\r\nIf you're born with a silver spoon, you might not feel what this series is conveying. \\n\r\nAs said earlier, this isn't a race on who makes it first, but who makes it better and  by far this series blew me away.\\n\r\nThe reasons why I'm giving this a straight 10/10 is because it made me care about a character in the matter of 2 episodes than any other series does in 100s",

            "content": "While some might disagree with me, I feel this is one of those anime that isn't for everyone. If you don't like shounen, you probably won't like this. If you prefer stories that are more cynical and down to earth, you probably won't like this. If you're not a fan of old fashioned superhero stories, you probably won't like this.\r\nBoth the shounen genre and the superhero genre have done a lot of growing in the past few years. Similar to more recent magical girl shows, these genres have been trying to break out of their previous molds. The stories and characters are becoming more grounded.More time is taken to explain how and why certain things happen. The characters are put through harsher situations to make the tension more realistic. In short, gritty and dark has been a trend as of late.\\n\\n\r\nBoku no Hero Academia is nothing like that. For the most part, it's lighthearted. The line between good and evil is drawn very clearly. There are certainly stakes, but even when things are at their toughest, you can count on everyone making it out alive and mostly unscathed.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is pretty basic. One day, people started being born with \"quirks,\" the term for superpowers in this anime. There's no real reason given for it, it just happened. Following that, villains started appearing around the world, and professional heroes rose up to fight against them.\\n\\n\r\nOur main character, Izuku, was born without any sort of quirk, which has become rare in this world. Despite that, he still dreams of becoming a great hero and being able to save others like his idol, All Might. Through a series of coincidences, he ends up meeting All Might, and he manages to leave an impression on him that leads him to decide to take Izuku on as a pupil.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's about as far as I think I can go without spoiling anything, though it's really easy to figure out where the plot is going from there if you know anything about your shounen or superhero tropes.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I'm still giving this series such a high score is a matter of how well it does all these traditional ideas. This is a very basic superhero story, but the fact of the matter is, superheroes haven't actually gotten that much exposure in anime. Not as much as in the West, at least. There are some superhero anime, but most shounen focus on something more connected to a type of mystical lore.\\n\\n\r\nNaruto is about ninjas. Dragonball has aliens and powerful attacks fueled by qui. Bleach is about soul reapers. Soul Eater is about the same thing, but looks at it from a different angle. Bnha is about an academy for training superheroes, plain and simple.\\n\\n\r\nThis simplicity allows the writers to get away with certain things that other shounen can't. I've never seen a shounen that was this popular that only had 13 episodes for its first season. Bnha cuts a lot of the fat, because they assume you'll just accept that this is a world with superheroes and that schools for training superheroes just are a thing now. They assume you won't question how a lot of the quirks work or why they appeared in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're not a person who can handle that, then this isn't for you. This is a show made for people who are looking for this kind of thing and just want to have fun with it. Is it deep? No. Is it thought provoking? No. Is it any sort of masterpiece? No, but it's a heck of a lot of fun for those who like these tropes and want to see them at their best. If you just want to see cool people do cool things while screaming about friendship and justice and the like, you can't do much better than this. It's nothing that will leave your mind blown the way some smarter anime will, but it'll leave you with a good feeling. If you're having a rough day and you're not up for something deep or dark, I say pull up a chair and enjoy. Bnha might be just what you need.",

The song also emulated the feelof what the anime was going to be about.\\n\r\nMaybe it's just me but when I saw that Kaji Yuki was gonna be voice acting as one of the characters I flipped out because it just further proves my point on how good of a voice actor he is, he voice acted in a variety of anime and it surprises me every time I see which character he voice acted, because those characters are polar opposites of eachother, personality and role wise.\\n\r\nI think anyone who enjoys their Marvel and DC stuff will enjoy My Hero Academia, because this show has a lot of similarities to those hero comics and movies in how the characters interact with the environment, eachother, and their idea of what a hero is.\\n\r\nI feel like this story is also a social commentary on Japan or even the world, the show hints to themes of risk and reward ever since the 1st episode, in which the Japanese people are a bit more cautious with their actions, opposite to the characters in the show taking their chances to get what they want even if it leads to something bad, the character doesn't have this complete YOLO mindset but they indeed go for opportunities that help make them grow.\\n\r\nPlease consider this review and start watching My Hero Academia.\\n",

            "content": "So after a long wait, I finally watch one of the most acclaimed series of 2016, and it was...good; with some gripes I might add.\r\nBoku no Hero Academia, the 'Marvel' of anime? Maybe, but not really. The story begins with a young boy named Midoriya, who is considered \"quirkless\" in this world. Quirks are powers that people are born with and are developed at a young age, but Midoriya did not develop his. From his sadness, he would fantasize about heroes that he admired and even go as far as to write a journal on heroes he found interesting. His wish in life was toalways be a hero, and one day gets the opportunity to become one; not knowing what might await him in the future. \\n\\n\r\nThe story sounds like it's riddled with cliches, and it is. But what really makes it are the characters and how determined some of them are. And the characters here are all unique, each boasting their own unique 'quirks'. And honestly this anime does a very good job at introducing what sort of characters and quirks everyone is/has. It doesn't just focus on the MC, yet, it focuses on many different characters and their abilities. While you might see some of the obvious tropes that we've seen many times before, I can't help but just like the enthusiasm that most, if not all the characters have. \\n\\n\r\nArt and sound are up, and well, I don't know what to say. The art is confusing. Some scenes are beautifully crafted and make this show look amazing, other times it looks like someone was in a hurry and spilt coffee on their tie; mainly because sometimes the backgrounds look very \"mushy\" and just kinda undone. The sound is good, nothing to flashy. The OP is pretty good, it has a nice ring to it, but again, nothing too special.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd say this anime was well worth the watch, even if it's riddled with cliches. I think with more focus on a good narrative and less on the stupid tropes that most anime follow, and this series could be something great. I'd recommend you watch this if you like anime like Kill La Kill, or AC. It's good, but not too toasty.",

            "content": "Boku no Hero Academia or My Hero Academia is one of the most popular shounen anime. Having already watched all the three currently released seasons, I rewatched this first season to really see what made My Hero Academia so popular in the first place.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story of My Hero Academia is not very complicated. Izuku Midoriya has always dreamed of becoming a hero, but his path seemed like a long one as he was not born with a quirk. One day he meets All Might, the number one hero, who gives him a chance to inherit his quirk, marking the start of Izuku Midoriya trainingat UA High School to become a pro hero. In the society of My Hero Academia you have a clear good and evil with heroes and villains, which is very typical of a shounen battle anime. However, it does use this simple concept very well throughout the anime using the different characters. The anime also gives some background information about quirks and some hints leading to more important plot points in season 2.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art in My Hero Academia is pretty basic, but the animation is well done. The art in the background is pretty simplistic for example. The character designs are well done, show a lot of variety and can often give an idea of what sort of quirk a certain character has. Background characters are also animated well and there is a lack of (bad) CGI being used. The animation is seen best in the fight scenes which studio Bones animated very well, like they did in other anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nMy Hero Academia has many great soundtracks with 'you say run' being a very popular and great one. Others like 'Hero A' are very good as well and can give a lot of hype during fight scenes. The opening theme is also very well done. The voice actors also do a very good job expressing the different emotions the characters have.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nMy Hero Academia has many different characters. You have All Might who is the number one hero, always entering the stage with a smile, really setting the example for how the number one hero should be. He is also the teacher of Izuku Midoriya who is inheriting his quirk, but he does not really know how to teach him very well. Izuku is trying to learn how to use his new quirk, but he does not really know how to, as his arm or legs constantly get broken and need to be healed by other heroes. Many of the different characters have problems like these which they need to overcome, leaving a lot of potential character development. A good aspect as well is that everyone in class A-1 (which is the only class shown in this season) has a clear personality and interacts with the main cast a lot. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nMy Hero Academia is overall a very enjoyable anime for me. There are some great fight scenes which are very enjoyable to watch and often tell a story through the fight. There are also a lot of different characters with all kinds of different personalities (although sometimes a bit one dimensional) who can be fun to watch as well as a lot of comedic situations. If you are not a fan of shounen battle anime though, your enjoyment of this anime probably would not be very good as many shounen tropes are present.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nMy Hero Academia is a very good anime. It may not have the most complicated story, but it executes it very well. It offers a variety of different characters with different motivations, attitudes and goals as well as great fight scenes and some pretty enjoyable comedic situations. These are all aspects which make it a very enjoyable anime to many people as the anime takes usual shounen situations and executes them very well. This trend continues in the second season as many aspects are even improved on.",

            "content": "So, I just finished the final episode minutes before sitting down to write this. Was this my favorite show of the season? Yes. I\u2019d say it\u2019s tied up between this and \u201cRe:Zero.\u201d Hero Academia gets some special points though because it really fired me up in a way that I used to get fired up for shonen anime back in the day. \r\nHero Academia really makes me think of something like a particularly good Naruto arc with all the filler cut out.\r\nSo what made this show so great? I think it\u2019s probably for the same reasons One Punch Man was such a wild success, peoplelike a good hero. Dark, gritty, real, none of those are words you would use to describe either of our heroes in Hero Academia or One Punch Man. In both of these anime the hero is someone who genuinely wants to help people. (Sure, I guess you could argue that Saitama is a self proclaimed hero for fun, but at the end of the day he\u2019s not the type to walk passed a mugging just because he didn\u2019t really feel like being a hero that day, and I think the fact that in his heart he\u2019s truly self sacrificing for the greater good is shown throughout the series.)\\n\\n\r\nThe trend recently is to make things real. Heroes might not all be so good, sometimes good people do bad things for the right reasons, sometimes seemingly good people ultimately have a very dark ulterior motive, all that jazz. It\u2019s everywhere in movies, games, anime, you name it. Goody two shoes have taken a very hard fall out of being fashionable. But I think people actually like a genuine hero more than they like a \u201creal\u201d hero because the \u201creal\u201d heroes don\u2019t give us anything to believe in. I thought \u201cMan of Steel\u201d was a cool movie, but it didn\u2019t make me want to be Superman. The really corny, always doing the best thing for everyone Superman? That guy actually makes me want to be a super hero. And I think My Hero Academia tapped into that same vein. It made me want to be a hero like All Might, and in doing so it made me really relate to Midoriya\u2019s aspirations. \\n\\n\r\nWatching Midoriya fight against the odds to fulfill his dream made me want to fight for my dreams too, the same way superman swooping in to save a cat from a tree or jumping in front of a kryptonite fueled train inspires me to be heroic too.",

            "content": "So like, I watched 300 episodes of Naruto, so that makes me some expert on shounen anime. Thing is, this is a good genre, but a lot of titles have too much bullshit. Corny backstories, cheap asspulls, ridiculous powers thinking that bigger=better; there are certainly good shounen, but a lot of them just come off as trying too hard. But Boku no Pico Academia doesn\u2019t step outside of anyone\u2019s comfort zone while it embraces the genre; it\u2019s a love letter to those who grew up thinking superheroes were fucking cool (which they are), and for those who still enjoy a traditional feel-good underdog story, allwithout stepping outside of its boundaries.\\n\\n\r\nTo anyone with a soul, the beginning of Izuku Midoriya\u2019s story is easy to understand. He grows up admiring the number one hero, Saitaaaaa...ll Might, and wants nothing more than to be a badass superhero like him, until he soon learns that he simply lacks the genes to do so. Yet, he continues to follow his dream and tries to become some sort of analyst or something, perhaps being a hero with knowledge. Gotta respect someone with determination like this.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing leads to another, and eventually Izuku really does end up with a great power, and starts his journey to become the greatest hero ever. But he doesn\u2019t get this power through a sheer amount of luck or through bloodlines, he actually earns it through hard, daunting work. \\n\\n\r\nWithout a corny, exaggeratedly tragic backstory, or a free super-overpowered ability, we get a typical shounen hero, one that\u2019s very believable and respectable. Izuku Midoriya isn\u2019t really an interesting character, but the basics of him are absolutely perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that is exaggerated a bit is the rivalry between Izuku and his childhood rival, Gary Oa--oh, sorry. I mean Bakuman, that\u2019s his name. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the rivalry, it\u2019s just a standard \u201chey this guy\u2019s better than me, I wanna beat him!\u201d versus \u201cHAHAHAHA SCRUB I\u2019M AWESOME GET GOOD SMELL YOU THE FUCK LATER\u201d, but the anime furiously hypes this rivalry up to the point where it\u2019s obvious that the they\u2019re buying time so the episode can fill twenty-four minutes. Like\u2026 I get it. Just fucking punch the guy, already. \\n\\n\r\nFlashbacks, a common shounen trait, are used pretty commonly in general, but they didn\u2019t bother me nearly as much as this one episode did. If anything, they go along with the show\u2019s slow pacing to add some real impact to the show\u2019s big HYPE!!! moments, which are extremely satisfying. This plays into Izuku\u2019s power, which is some sort of super-strength, but using it will essentially crush the body part it\u2019s used from. This means that not only is it severely limited, but using it involves making a clear, conscious decision, leading to each attack being a huge, swift moment with a lot of build-up.\\n\r\nSo I guess it\u2019s kind of an orgasm, have fun thinking about that from now on.\\n\\n\r\nBut the biggest moments for me were those involving All Might, the #1 hero and almighty (heh) symbol of justice. In a tale all about superheroes and learning how to become one, it\u2019s good to have a character that embodies the role perfectly. He\u2019s the strongest, he\u2019s the nicest, and he doesn\u2019t afraid of anything. His relationship with Izuku is a charming one (no homo tho) and has a struggle of his own, adding to his ideal personality, and his one big fight in the series made for the most exciting scene in all thirteen episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOther superheroes, young and old, play a part in the anime, but not as significantly. For now, most others play as bystanders that observe and take a small part of the action. Everyone\u2019s powers are rather basic and linear: super-strength, gravity, explosives, fire&ice, etc., but they\u2019re made a little more interesting with just a bit of ingenuity. \\n\\n\r\nBattles are often accompanied by some really exciting music, much of it being orchestral with a few pieces having some electronic layers that mingle well with the instrumentation. Much of the other tracks have a good driving feel, such as the vocal-included rock track known as \u2018Hero A\u2019. If you don\u2019t remember what that is, it\u2019s the one that says \u201cMY HERO!!\u201d And uh\u2026 other things, I guess. Yeah. The seiyuu are pretty great; Izuku\u2019s annoying whiny voice is made a little better with his emotional range and mature narration, Bakuman\u2019s hateful, raging screams are intense as hell, and All Might has a pretty hilarious and great dichotomy between his booming, powerful voice in his superhero form and the frail, weak tone of his true form.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is a good rock song, and while not as overall powerful as a mighty hero, its beginning is a striking, hype-filled section with a great hook. The visuals matching it are rather basic in direction, but effective enough, as it gives a brief look at the main character and the supporting cast with their powers. It\u2019s good to have an action montage and actually know what the fuck is happening in it. The ED is of similar caliber, but not as dynamic or emotional as the OP. I didn\u2019t care for it much, in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is decent overall, with some great moments where it counts. Battles feature some great animation and a lot of environmental effects like smoke and fire incorporated perfectly. The characters themselves look pretty interesting, and facial expressions always lined up with the vocal performances, both soft and hard. The villains, appropriately named by the show as Villains (don\u2019t get confused, now), are the most interesting, with the endgame\u2019s baddie having one of the strangest appearances ever, with an edgy-as-fuck voice to match it. In a way I wanna laugh at how ridiculously emo he is, but it\u2019s also so crazy that I can buy into it.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Hero Academia is pretty average, pretty basic. And I respect that. It doesn\u2019t take risks and attempt something it\u2019s not, but the amount of heart it has prevents it from feeling cheap or stale. If you want just a simple little action shounen, it\u2019s right here. But for anyone who craves a little more, maybe you should stick with Hunter x Hunter.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6/10\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nCharacters - 6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nHYPE - FULL/10\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\\n\r\nFavorite episode - 12\\n\r\nFavorite character - All Might\\n\r\nRecommendation level - High",

            "content": "Boku no Hero Academia Review\r\nStory (8/10) Very Good\r\nMore Specifically (8.50/10) Very Good \r\nThe Story Arcs that Season 1 of Boku No Hero Academia covers where very good arcs. Setup arcs, exam arcs and a ambush arc basically. They were all very well done and the pacing was very good also. This first couple arcs do indeed focus a lot more on Izuzku, All Might and Bokugou more than any of the other characters so if you were looking for more attention from any other character than isn't those three than you might feel just a tad but unsatisfied. It had very good built up tothe end of this very good season. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (8/10) Very Good\\n\r\nMore Specifically (8.75/10) Very Good+\\n\\n\r\nEveryone say the names of the animators and the company that would be behind the adaptation of Boku No Hero and where really happy that it was in the hands of Bones because their track record is not bad but very good actually the only thing they are known for that shines in a bad light to some digree is giving us original endings that weren't in the manga. Examples the first FMA and Noragami Season 1. But when it came to Boku No Hero they didn't do that it adapted everything very well from and from an animation standpoint it was very good also it wasn't the best but it's definitely not bad to no degree. The hypest fight we had to look forward to was on episode 12 and although the fight was well animated a drop in art style during that fight scene did that place which didn't happen anywhere else in the entire season but it will most likely get cleaned up in the retail releases but for right now that's the only thing I can truly nitpick at from an animation or art style standpoint.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10) Great \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is probably the best part of this series the Opening and the ending match the series and I didn't skip them once. The BGM and sound effects during the anime was also great also I would call it a masterpiece but it's great nonetheless. Voice acting was on point also (JP VA) I know the dub started and I haven't heard it so I  am only talking about the Japanese voice acting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10) Very Good\\n\r\nMore Specifically (8.50/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Boku No Hero Academia were very good also. Not great because like I said before majority of them weren't really focused on in this season just an introduction of their powers and a bit of screen time here and there but for the characters there were focused on we did get enough to keep us or at least me entertained enough to not have a huge problem with the fact that the others didn't get enough screen time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) Very Good\\n\r\nMore Specifically (8.50/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nMy Enjoyment for Boku No Hero was very good I was always present the day the episode aired and I enjoyed every single episode fairly. Bones to a very good job bring this series to life.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10) Very Good\\n\r\nMore Specifically (8.65/10) Very Good+ \\n\\n\r\nBoku No Hero Academia anime adaptation I think succeeded as it covered the first 21 chapters of the manga in 12 episodes and announced a Season 2 for next year. Popularity for this series will skyrocket and Bones did it justice.",

            "content": "So this is going to be a review of the first season of my hero academia! \r\n*SPOILERS ALERT*\r\nMy hero academia was probably the most hyped up anime of this season and it's understandable why, it's the next big shonen according to alot of people. Now does it live up to it's hype? It certainly did for me!\r\nStory:\r\nSimple, in a future where 80% of the world population have manifested a power like ability referred as a Quirk! These powers can be anything from psychic abilites to fiery explosions. Anyways our protagonist Izuku Midoriya is a boy who want to become a strong hero like his rolemodel, the strongest hero: All might. \\n\\n\r\nProblem is that he is one of the few minority without a quirk, this leaves him devestated but he still strives to get in to his dream highschool: U.A.\\n\r\nAs the anime  progress Midoriya manage to acquire a powerful quirk trough his role model All might. But to use this quirk he must train hard to be a worthy vessel.\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place during Midoriyas first year at highschool. The story itself is very simple and not very complicated. I found the story very exciting an wanting more. The story is simple but brings out the best in it. An intresting story that will keep you hooked. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe studio behind Hero Academia is Bones who are known for both the FMA series and Noragami. It aint no madhouse but bones does a really good job and does the manga justice. Beautiful brightful colors and the fight scenes are also animated very well. Especially All might vs Nomu which is considerd by many as the best fight since Saitama vs Boros. \\n\\n\r\nOverall a fantastic job done by Bones, cudos to them!\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe soundtrack is to be honest outstanding. It captures moments like All might vs Nomu soooooo well and it hypes you up! You get super excited at some scenes which is contributed by the great soundtracks. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe Characters are very shonen like. There is this cool guy, there is this hotblooded guy, A girl who has a crush on the main character and so on. If you like shonens you will definitely enjoy the characters, if you dont like shonens then you probably wont as much but you might still like them. \\n\\n\r\nThe first season focused alot on Midoriya as a Character and he got a good bit of development. From being a insecure cry baby he actually becomes alot more confident in himself and developes as a person. He's not so nervous around people as he used to be and actually stands up to his bully!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\\n\r\nI like shonens but they were starting to get a bit boring to me and predictable but hero academia reignited the fire inside of me. I have not enjoyed a Shonen like this in a long time and it feels great. With beautiful brightful colors and a fantastic soundtrack to go with the action you cant help but smile and fangirl/boy at some points as you get caught up in the moment. Im not being a Fanboy right now as i had kind of low expectations on this series and tough it would turn out to be popular first and then decrease like Fairy tail but after reading the manga to i can say that it will only get better from here on with every arc.\\n\\n\r\nHero Academia is here to stay and will stay for a long time as it's not going to end anytime soon! Just sit back and enjoy this Masterpiece in the making!",

            "content": "On paper, this anime sounds like a very generic, shounen one, and that's because it is, but there's something about this anime that somehow makes it also unique and different \u2014\u00a0the main character is relatable. In previous shounen anime, the main character was one of very few archetypes. He would either be the cocky, overly confident protagonist or the overly annoying, has-to-yell-everything protagonist (I'm looking at you Naruto and Asta!). In this anime, Deku is neither of them; he's just a regular, run-of-the-mill boy who wants to be just like his role model. Now tell me that doesn't make you say/think, \"I relate to him.\"And then tell me that when Deku is told that he can never be like his role model, you didn't say/think, \"Ok, now I *really* relate to him.\" The reason why this anime is so great and popular is because even though it is over the top and fictional, there are moments in the anime where we can all connect and relate to in our lives. This anime is generic and basic, but it's got heart and soul.",

            "content": "*Spoilers ahead *\r\nThis show seemed to get quite a lot of hype and attention on the internet and anime forums, so i though - \"Why not check it out?\". And so i did. And oh boy, was i disappointing. Now as with every show, i go in with reasonable low expectations, hoping to be pleasantly surprised later. In this case i sure wasn't.\r\nFirst, and most important problem - complete lack of originality. Most people gain super powers at some point (boy, have never seen this one!). The protagonist isn't only in the minority who don't have powers, but is also physically weak (underdog? yep, forthe millionth time). School setting? DOUBLE FUCKING CHECK (honestly at this point you'd think the Japanese have no other meaningful events in their life except school?). Need more? Ok, how about a sudden plot device to give him some kind of op power? You got it! But he can't control his power and needs to train? You bet! \\n\\n\r\nNow, as bad as this is, all of those wouldn't be enough to bring down a show if it was still any kind of good. But its not nearly the end of the problem! First of all - the progression is awful (something that is seen in the shounen genre quite often, especially those that have a lot of characters due to attention division). Second of all - most of this season was spent on introduction dialogues and common stuff, so obviously it will be quite a boring watch, with the only exception probably being the past couple of episodes, and in a show with a measly 12 episodes (at least this season)..? Yeah, no good. The art and sound are decent, but the story is extremely mediocre (and again, completely unoriginal - underdog trains to become the strongest, random group of villains attack here and there for no reason other than being bad (at least give them a financial intensive from time to time or something? jeez!)), and most the characters are flat an boring. Add in the lack of action and flashiness and you get a very unimpressive combo.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict - would probably not suggest this title to anyone except kids, big shounen fans and people new to the medium.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nThe greatest heroes in my life are none other than my parents.\r\nThey have taught me that understanding wins arguments and kindness wins hearts. They have picked me up when I am sick, and they have looked after me as I have accomplished my goals. And they have always made sure that, no matter what, I am loved unconditionally.\r\nThey can\u2019t fly in the sky, and they certainly don\u2019t wear capes. But they are heroes. My heroes.\r\nA sentiment Boku no Hero Academia would more than advocate.\r\nSTORY\r\nIzuku Midoriya, otherwise known as Deku, lives in a world where peoplemanifest powers known simply as Quirks. Unfortunately for Deku, his never manifested, forcing on him the Quirkless moniker. Yet a fateful encounter with All Might \u2013 the best hero ever and Deku\u2019s idol \u2013 grants Deku the opportunity to finally become the hero he has always dreamed of being.\\n\\n\r\nBoku no Hero has many parts worth praising.\\n\\n\r\nOne can praise the battles. They each have a purpose in the context of the show: getting the initial meeting with All Might, Deku\u2019s duel with Bakugou, and the students\u2019 first real taste of danger and villainy. Not to mention that they are filled with awesome moments, like Deku\u2019s upwards Delaware Smash to win the mock-hero test or the group working together to let Iida escape to get backup.\\n\\n\r\nOne can praise the comedy. While nothing gut-busting occurs, the anime has its share of silly jokes despite all the drama. Ochako tossing her baseball and earning a score of infinity or Deku and Asui (sorry, meant Tsu) looking unimpressed by Mineta\u2019s sticky balls get the audience laughing through good timing and good usage of the Quirks.\\n\\n\r\nOne can praise those Quirks. There are the standard super-strength, speed buffs, and invisibility. But then there is the duo ice-and-fire combo. The black hole. The literal controlling of bullets. Plus, the anime combines these Quirks in creative ways like when Momo creates a nonconducting shroud so that Denki can electrify their enemies. Clearly, the show presents a variety of unique and interesting abilities throughout the whole season.\\n\\n\r\nNow, criticisms exist for these separate parts. The fights involving Shigaraki rely too much on the saved-in-the-knick-of-time clich\u00e9. The comedy doesn\u2019t always stick. A sizable portion of the Quirks are not used to their fullest extent. But these problems are not so glaring that they defeat their overall nice amount of execution.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights, the comedy, the Quirks. All noteworthy. But Boku no Hero\u2019s best, its most important accomplishment is something sincerer.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a story about heroes. More specifically, it\u2019s a story about Deku becoming a hero. As the anime shows, one can be a hero with granite arms. Or with frog-like moves. Or with electricity. That certainly makes one a hero.\\n\\n\r\nBut to truly be a hero, it requires determination. It requires courage. It requires doing the right thing not because it\u2019s the right thing to do \u2013 but because one can.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, the description of the story has to change once more because Deku has always been a hero.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, this story is about what it means to be a hero. Saving one\u2019s childhood friend from the clutches of despair. Protecting a fellow student, thereby sacrificing one\u2019s chances at his or her dreams in the process. Risking it all, despite knowing the danger, to let his mentor live on.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a hero is more than just having a cool Quirk. Being a hero means being a good person.\\n\\n\r\nSo, from the Quirk to the Quirkless, everyone can be a hero. That\u2019s the show\u2019s message.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s just awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does have trouble in the drama department when Deku yells and cries way too much and Bakugou spouts incessant dialogue about killing and being better than everyone. It gets old fast. Episode seven, where the two basically duel one another, is especially guilty.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of this issue, the anime\u2019s focus on establishing its setting and ideas in this first season demonstrate its own Quirk: telling a fun and thoughtful story.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nBoku no Hero is mixed when it comes to its art and its animation.\\n\\n\r\nEasily at the top are the character designs. Especially the superhero outfits. While perhaps expected, the colorful clothes and specialized accessories not only highlight their respective personalities but also invoke a sense of fun and wonder.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Shouto\u2019s fire-and-ice outfit makes him simultaneously cool and fiery (in more ways than one). Bakugou\u2019s grenade gloves fit his explosive ability. And Recovery Girl\u2019s syringe hairpiece and lab coat give her that relevant doctor look.\\n\\n\r\nNot to be outdone are the villains. Shigaraki\u2019s creepy hands, Noumu\u2019s exposed brain, and Kurogiri\u2019s phantasmal existence make it clear that these baddies mean business.\\n\\n\r\nThe best, however, goes to All Might. His massive muscles, the extreme shadowing that covers his eyes and part of his face, and his different outfits (yellow suit, red-and-blue hero garb, etc.), alongside his big, beaming smile, paint him as the friendly giant and Symbol of Peace he is known to be. Not to mention his decrepit persona, with its lanky, jagged appearance, that contrasts well with his buff self.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation likewise remains high throughout the season. Deku rocking in his chair. Ochako smashing debris with an improvised baseball bat. All Might going berserk during his first true fight. Lots of battles and moments give the anime the chance for a lot of movement \u2013 to which it answers.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the artistry, it\u2019s mixed. Lighting hardly plays a role in the various scenes portrayed, and the background art is forgettable. Yet the choreography of the fights is easy enough to follow, and the expressions of the characters (especially Deku) are quite detailed (perhaps to a fault).\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the anime\u2019s visuals are another aspect that deserve some praise.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nBoku no Hero is yet another anime with a huge cast. But, per usual, only a few of them matter most. In this case, those chosen few would be Deku, Bakugou, and All Might.\\n\\n\r\nFrom an early age, Deku looked up to All Might, wanting to be the same as the greatest of superheroes. However, he learned just as early that he was Quirkless. I.e., unlike the majority of people, he did not inherit a unique power.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, the anime takes a somewhat unconventional route. His mother, rather than encouraging him to fight or have hope, apologizes. In essence, she loses faith in him, leaving him crestfallen and without the future he wants. For if one\u2019s own mother cannot even believe, then what hope can Deku have?\\n\\n\r\nIn school, he is picked on, and, out of school, he longs to be what he cannot. Thankfully, he meets with, of all people, All Might. And after Deku saves Bakugou, All Might lets Deku hear the words that his mother never said: \u201cYou can be a hero.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nDeku trains and trains at All Might\u2019s behest, becoming fitter and stronger than the average person. All in preparation to literally eat a strand of All Might\u2019s hair to inherit his ability, One For All. Thus, Deku turns into All Might\u2019s successor.\\n\\n\r\nIn a weird way, though, this development effectively resets Deku back to zero. For where he was Quirkless and then became strong, gaining One For All makes him \u201cweak\u201d once more since, as is shown, he cannot control the ability whatsoever. That\u2019s not a negative; it\u2019s simply a new arc for him to follow.\\n\\n\r\nYes, it is frustrating seeing Deku always unable to control the Quirk. But it\u2019s a process. He is gradually learning to wield it, like when only using his index finger to throw a baseball or when he flicks the lake beneath him to create a swirling vortex.\\n\\n\r\nSo, unlike the others who can rely on their Quirks, Deku must dig deeper. He thinks up plans, makes calculated moves, chooses when and where to use his newfound power. All the while, he champions that true-hero theme by doing what he can to be a good person. Be it giving his position of class leader to Iida or trying to let Bakugou slightly in on his secret.\\n\\n\r\nDeku goes through a lot in the first half of the season, and, while he does not change much during the second half, he gains friends, learns more about himself, and slowly starts to take control of his newfound Quirk. It\u2019s a season that starts him on the right path towards the ultimate end goal of being the best hero the world has ever known.\\n\\n\r\nBakugou is the weakest of the three, but he is not without his own developments.\\n\\n\r\nHe grew up believing he was the best. Nobody ever told him otherwise, especially when his Quirk appeared. His juxtaposition with Deku, who was weaker and without his own Quirk, made it all the more obvious to Bakugou that he was someone special.\\n\\n\r\nHis mean-spirited attitude and general feeling of superiority likewise made him despise Deku. Bakugou saw in his childhood friend something he had never once had before: compassion. As such, Bakugou\u2019s hatred for Deku burned as bright as the flames that sparked from his hands.\\n\\n\r\nIt took losing to Deku, in stunning fashion before All Might and the other students, to finally start chipping away at his arrogance. The sheer strength of other heroes like Shouto further caused him to realize that, no, he\u2019s not the king he believed himself to be.\\n\\n\r\nSo, while Bakugou crying as he leaves the school and acknowledging that he lost to Deku are minor happenings for normal people, these were huge steps for the arrogant explosion wielder. And, if nothing else, him falling off his high horse taught the audience a simple lesson: hard work can beat raw talent any day of the week.\\n\\n\r\nThis leaves All Might. On a literal level, he obviously stands above both Deku and Bakugou, for he is the best hero to ever grace the Earth. But on a narrative level, he may do so as well.\\n\\n\r\nHe does not receive development in the traditional sense such as changing over the course of the season or experiencing a definitive arc. But that does not lessen his overall impact. Indeed, his best contribution comes from what superheroes do best: supporting others.\\n\\n\r\nAll Might supports the world. He does his best to protect civilians, lead the heroes, and fight for happiness.\\n\\n\r\nAll Might supports Deku. He mentors the boy, training him, helping him, and looking after him.\\n\\n\r\nAll Might supports his other students. He gives them the means to become better heroes, and he teaches them in a manner that is both inspiring and fun.\\n\\n\r\nBut, most of all, All Might supports the narrative. Throughout the entire season, his character was built up, swirling in intrigue and wonder. The rumors about his deeds and abilities. The decrepit state of his actual self. The carefree attitude he always seemed to wear.\\n\\n\r\nIt was all in preparation for his first true fight (in episode twelve entitled, appropriately enough, \u201cAll Might\u201d). The gradual hype that surrounded him, leading up to All Might finally going all out, made his debut performance not just an incredible spectacle but a statement. That, yes, All Might truly is almighty.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to Deku and Bakugou, All Might does not develop. But, when it comes to supporting literally everyone and everything else in the anime, no one else comes close to the Symbol of Peace.\\n\\n\r\nOne closing note. Ochako has an argument for having importance, too. But, given that she comes in at about the halfway mark in the season, and, during the final fight, she is practically sidelined, she does not play much of a role besides being the main potential love interest for Deku. Hopefully she will have a more prominent role in the next season, but, for now, it\u2019s fine to let the other three take the limelight.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track of Boku no Hero instills that sense of longing and triumph that permeates the show itself. The slower first half, with its starting lone guitar and somber tone, gives way to the faster and more involved second half. It\u2019s a catchy piece that makes the audience feel exactly what they need to before heading into each episode of the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track may not be as varied in its pace or beat, but it is certainly more emotional than its OP counterpart. The steady drums and guitar that charge forward just as Deku does. The determined vocalist fitting that heartfelt pursuit. The ending bit where the extra pauses compared to before allow for self-reflection on where one is and where one has come from. Altogether, the ED is a strong piece. Perhaps the strongest the anime offers.\\n\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack contains strength as well. Not as much as the OP and the ED do, but it is not without some nice songs. \u201cYou Say Run\u201d as winning battle music works well to pump up the audience. \u201cWatashi Gaki Ta!!\u201d, often played in the next-episode previews, nails that superhero feel. \u201cBousou Suru Akui\u201d invokes foreboding and dread. \u201cHero A\u201d uses hip-hop singing and English lyrics to get at coolness. \u201cKokoro wo Shihai shi te Iku Yami\u201d keeps it creepy with its slow build-up.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST\u2019s slice-of-life tracks are not as strong as its more fight-oriented and hero-centric ones, but that\u2019s maybe expected. Overall, though, it\u2019s a fine heaping of songs that go along with Boku no Hero nicely enough.\\n\\n\r\n(Side note: \u201cMekamekamekemeke\u201d is the best song title from the OST. Too bad the piece itself isn\u2019t.)\\n\\n\r\nBoku no Hero also gets props for some of its sound-effects. The charge-up that goes on when Deku is about to use One For All. Shigaraki\u2019s neck scratching. (That weirdo needs to stop that.) And the small light-up in-between the A and B parts of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the voice acting performances are another positive for the show. Notably speaking, Daiki Yamashita as Deku and Kenta Miyake as All Might deserve shout-outs. The former for the wide range of emotion he experiences, and the latter for sounding exactly like what the best superhero ever would.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nTwo characters from the anime stood out as my favorites. One obvious and one not-so-obvious.\\n\\n\r\nThe obvious one is All Might. He\u2019s a cool guy for giving Deku the chance of a lifetime. He\u2019s also pretty funny, exploding into his buff body or smiling while blood trickles down his chin.\\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s that final fight that won me over. I remember applauding afterwards at just how awesome the whole scene was. It was a little lame that Noumu was still alive, but the fight itself still stood out as one of the best parts from the entire season. And I have All Might to thank for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe not-so-obvious one is Asui (sorry, meant Tsu). Admittedly, I didn\u2019t like her at first, but she really grew on me. Speaking her mind, saying ribbit all the time, staring ahead with the same expression on her face. She was a surprisingly fun character. Even if she was only around for the last few episodes or so.\\n\\n\r\n(Also, shout out to the Mickey Mouse principal. I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s hiding some super Quirk, like he turns into a voracious, unstoppable beast when provoked. Would like to see him join the fray at some point.)\\n\\n\r\nThose two are my favorite. I do like Deku. It\u2019s fun to root for him: in fighting the bad guys, in getting closer with Ochako, in learning from All Might.\\n\\n\r\nBut I\u2019m not a big fan of him still being pretty much useless. Yea, it makes sense for his character and where the story is at currently. But I\u2019d like to see him, in the sequel, start to be one of the team instead of the one-and-done dude he\u2019s been for so long. Because, honestly speaking, I have seen him maim himself enough times already to get that One For All is insanely powerful.\\n\\n\r\nOchako is cool, too. Granted, she doesn\u2019t really do anything this season, but her laughing out loud at Iida\u2019s attempts at being evil and her resting her forehead on the glass window when Deku and Bakugou are holding a \u201cfated battle between men\u201d made me like her more than Deku.\\n\\n\r\nBesides All Might, Asui (sorry, meant Tsu), Ochako, and Deku, I was not fond of any of the other characters. Especially Bakugou. His constant spiels on killing and being better got annoying real fast. That started to let up (understandably) after his big loss against Deku, but he still remained a dude I didn\u2019t care for.\\n\\n\r\nAs for everyone else, their abilities are intriguing. No doubt about that. I simply don\u2019t see them as characters that I will be remembering once the series inevitably concludes.\\n\\n\r\nBoku no Hero Academia is a strong start for this heroic adventure. The story\u2019s message is heartfelt, the visuals and music are intriguing and passionate, and the characters better themselves and each other. It\u2019s a sky-flying, cape-wearing ride that\u2019s clearly on the plus-ultra path to victory.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, while some of its drama gets a bit over-the-top, the action sequences, the comedy, and the fun Quirk premise, alongside a strong message on what it means to be a hero, create a well-rounded and thoughtful starting narrative\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, fun and interesting character designs, nice actual animation, but a mixed artistic direction\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Deku, Bakugou, and All Might bring their A-game to the academy, starting the series off on the right superhero foot\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good OP, good ED, okay OST, nice sound-effects, and good VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, a ton of the side cast members are lame, but All Might, Asui (sorry, meant Tsu), Ochako, and Deku keep the entertainment going\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "My Hero Academia is clearly intended to be enjoyed by a younger audience, but those willing to open up there sense of childlike wonder may be pleasantly surprised.\r\nThe show gets inspiration from western comic books, and takes no hesitation in hitting you over the head with spoofing and satire. I would liken the experience much to that of a masochist, yes, you are getting slammed in the coconut multiple times, but it is an enjoyable slamming.\r\nThis is in part to the world building, which is the shows strongest aspect. If one was to go into the show with there audio off, they would still havea vague understanding of the plot through visual communication. They use the large budget wisely, and tend to go a \"show, don't tell route.\". The setting screams comic book, from the towering sky scrapers to the dark back alleys, and the gorgeously crafted world is speckled with some of the most wonderfully designed characters from recent years.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are so over the top and unique that they all stay in your mind long after viewing. From there costumes to the powers, they all feel like  wonderfully different characters. The main downfall with these characters is shared with the show in general, the one dimensionality of the characters and plot.\\n\\n\r\nDecisions made by characters are predictable, and do very little to grow and develop characters. The Midoriya from the last episode, seems to be the very same Midoriya from first episode, except with a shiny new suit. This summarizes my problem with the show.\\n\\n\r\nIt's all FLASH and no SUBSTANCE.\\n\\n\r\nBattles are drawn out, and beautifully brought to life, but the underlying implications of the fights are always lacking. The fights suffer due to a lack of realistic choices made by the characters. From episode one, we learn that Kacchan is a jerk, and Midoriya is a saint. The once friends turned rivals is a tired cliche, and one that these shonens all seem to rely on. Their repeated fights all stem from this premise, but have done little to change or influence the characters minds or directions. They fight because it looks cool and it sells. If you can come to terms with this and accept it, you will enjoy the show that much more.\\n\\n\r\nThemes and motifs of the show revolve that of hope. The show comes down to two basic ideas.\\n\\n\r\n1. Hardwork beats natural talent.\\n\r\n2. Anyone can become a hero\\n\\n\r\nWhile many other ideas influence the show, these are the points that drives the plot and premise. These points can come off as overstated and pretentious at times, but serves as a decent foundation for the characters to romp around.\\n\\n\r\nIt is no doubt, a heartfelt story, but one that is often to rich for it's own good. It's like that piece of cake that is only good sparingly. \\n\\n\r\nSo despite this, why did I love the show? \\n\r\nBecause it's a fun ride. I love rooting for Midorya, I love getting to explore the lovingly crafted world, and I most of all loved seeing all the characters, powers, and costume. It tickles your imagination, and reminds you of days in the back yard as a kid, swinging sticks around as if they were swords. \\n\\n\r\nThis is not the Shakespeare of anime, this is a love letter to the beauty of imagination. Yes the show has issues, but they are issues I am willing to overlook based on the nostalgic feelings the show invokes. It may not be a head scratcher, but accepting the show for what it is leads to a freeing bliss episode to episode. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Score- 9 (Great)\\n\r\nCritical Score- 6 (Fine)",

            "content": "If I were to explain what makes this show great to someone who's never seen anime, I think I would use the following analogy: Think of the simple task of cooking an egg; something that anyone can do. You would have the same expectation for the egg every time. But, if you bring in a buffoon to cook it, he\u2019ll screw it up. Yet, if you bring a professional to cook it, they\u2019ll take every step and do it in such a way as to maximize the quality of the same very simple dish. That is what Boku no Hero is. A very simple dishthat is cooked in such a satisfying way. Nothing new, just the same old taste by someone who knows how to cook.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe first three episodes follow the development of our main protagonist from some guy who has no superpowers and is a total wimp to someone who learns to grow and give it his all and at least tries to be more confident. You know, the story is nothing great. Pretty simple. A guy is weak and stands out in a bad way compared to everyone else and he gains great power through his passion and grows as a person. But, my god, the execution, and writing just carry\u2019s this meh story into a Woaah story. Midoriya, the main protagonist, has this obsession with wanting to be a hero, and when he is denied that, he shatters into a million pieces. In this world, getting a special personalized power means a lot to people; these powers called quirks. Something you can empathizing with as mortifying to Midoriya. Yet, he doesn\u2019t give up even though the world has told him it's basically impossible. In fact, he doubles down. He keeps these notebooks where he extensively and obsessively logs the quirks that he witnesses that others have. All this to try his absolute hardest to bridge the seemingly unbridgeable gap with knowledge. And this contrast between his diligence and passion with his cowardice and lacking ability serves to create an interesting character with flaws that I want to root for. \\n\\n\r\n\tA character introduced earlier on was All Might. He is the all-American, from the ground up, pure physical strength, trademark superman of the world: the symbol of all that is good. Midoriya in this passionate way holds him up like a deity and a role model like how back in the day I would deify Goku from Dragon Ball and the pharaoh from yu-gi-oh as these badasses that I wanted to be. It\u2019s really great, he\u2019s even holding the action figure and has this pure look of childish joy on his face. This truly sells to me the amount of admiration Midoriya has for All-Might. This makes the meeting that Midoriya has with All Might even more interesting. When Midoriya meets All-Might for the first time, he\u2019s in the middle of saving the day like he always does. Midoriya expectedly follows his role-model obsessively because he wants to meet him. Long story short, they end up on top of a secluded building and one of the most unexpected things happens. All-Might loses his super buff, superhuman form and turns into this dinky, skinny, suspicious looking character. The expression that Midoriya has on his face perfectly sums up the situation and mirrors the look on the audiences faces, \u201cHuh?\u201d. It turns out that All-Might is a flawed human being that isn\u2019t the best at dealing with people and doesn\u2019t have perfect judgement of reasoning skills. I think this is perfect. It points out an underlying theme in the show that is constantly explored in depth: there are no true saints no matter how brightly they shine. Even all might, the strongest superhero in the world with unparalleled fame and high status as the symbol of peace is still at the end of the day this deeply flawed man underneath, and no amount of muscle and suits can cover that up. In a world full of superheroes and supervillains, there flaws, and raw human emotion lend them a sense of legitimacy. Midoriya asks All-Might if even though he doesn\u2019t have a quirk if he could become a hero and All-Might flat out tells him no, that he needs to be realistic and realize that the world can\u2019t work that way. A pretty painful thing to hear, but Midoriya still hasn\u2019t given on up the inside. He may be on the verge of giving up consciously, but not subconsciously. We come to find a little bit later than the Baddie that All-Might was chasing escaped and is wreaking havoc. Unfortunately, All-Might can\u2019t help because he\u2019s all out of power. So, in an unlikely turn of events, Midoriya ends up at that place too. He sees the exact same situation as all might does, as well as all the other heroes around him, yet he does something that none of them do, he just blindly jumps in and rushes at the baddie who\u2019s holding someone hostage and tries to save the guy, even if he is so powerless. This in turn inspires All-Might, who has realized why he\u2019s a hero, to gather what little strength he has left and save the day. Not only is this scene great in that Midoriya, this quirkless guy, inspires his role-model, All-Might the superman of the world, it is also great in that Midoriya embodies what it means to be a true hero. There are hero schools, hero organizations, and regulations on heroes that were laid down by the government: an elaborate system for being a hero. Yet, all this is superfluous. Getting caught up in all of it misses the point of being a hero. You shouldn\u2019t have to always watch your every step, follow the protocol to a tee, and do what your told. You\u2019re a hero! And there is one thing a hero does, save the day no matter what. This may be idealistic, but it\u2019s also an ideal which makes you smile and feel that rush of excitement and warmth. Midoriya just jumps in because there is someone who needs his help and he needs to save them, the hallmark of what a hero is. He reignited that same feeling in All-Might and showed him where his roots lie. Sure, its illogical that Midoriya jumped in so foolishly, but that misses the point entirely. This is a scene that shows two types of heroes, the classic whole-hearted hero and the modern, regulated one, before posing the question: what makes a true hero?\\n\\n\r\n\tMidoriya inspiring All-Might leads to him feeling that he has found someone worthy of inheriting his quirk (A unique quirk that is inherited through generations and has to do with legacy power). All-Might offers his quirk to Midoriya and Midoriya just breaks down in tears because after so long, after feeling that he\u2019d never realize it, his dream had come true. All that pain and sorrow from people telling him he couldn\u2019t, being bullied for not having a quirk and having to slog through the swamp of despair and move forward with trying to be a hero. It all comes to a head and comes bursting forth from Midoriya. The weight has been lifted off his back. He begins his training under All-Might in order to inherit the quirk and we are treated to this satisfying montage of Midoriya, cleaning the beach that is basically a dump. He trains by carrying all of these heavy objects across the beach in certain ways to train his muscles as well as eating a heavy diet and getting enough rest. Still, Midoriya diligence shines through and he goes overboard with it. At the end of his training, which lasted about a year, we see him standing on a collected pile of trash, ripped, clenching his fists with his head pointed toward the sky, screaming a victory cry at the top of his lungs. It\u2019s only been three episodes, but seeing him at the end of this long journey of finally becoming able to fulfill his dream transfers all that emotion from Midoriya to the audience. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe reason I went into such extensive detail about the first three episodes is that I believe they serve as both a solid foundation for the show and give a feeling for both the potential and place where the show is heading. A mini-arc that I absolutely adore and beautifully sets up the show by pulling me in deep. Something that characterized the first three episodes along with the entire series is character. All the cast like Midoriya and All-Might, are simple characters with simple motivations. Yet, by design, the more exposure you have to them, the more endearing they become. You learn about their strengths and weaknesses. You see them in the moment, and not just in the past. Every second tells you a little something new about their growth or who they are. That\u2019s just a little piece of what some great writing can do. Take Bakugo. Doesn\u2019t start out very nice. In fact, he\u2019s the biggest asshole in the world by the mere fact that he is the biggest, most avid bully towards Midoriya and constantly hammers home how much more inferior he is just to boost his own ego. But then he is humiliated and has to be saved by Midoriya. We learn that being praised so much and everyone following him and saying how great he was got to his head to the point where he could only see Midoriya as a quirkless freak. He wholeheartedly believes he is superior because of the people around him and that starts to wear down when he is saved by that same quirkless freak. It finally cracks when he is bested by Midoriya, a humiliation which gets to the core of his being and makes us see him as more than just an aggressive asshole; he really values his pride and wants to make sure he lives up to giftedness others saw in him for himself. The characters may be simple, but these little moments and nuggets of information just add on and give these characters life. Not to mention design. Bakugo has these sharp features and spiky hair to emphasized how sharp-edged he is.  The hero costumes are great. They have this extra level of detail put into them to make the world more vivid, like how Bakugo\u2019s forearm sleeves look like grenades.\\n\\n\r\n\tAnother thing I want to point out is the character dynamics between Midoriya and the cast. When Midoriya deeply engages with another character in the cast, like Bakugo or All-Might, he instills at least a little of that classic hero passion into them. In turn, he learns about those around him and how people have their own problems even as superheroes. These pieces of information allow him to grow. But this only works because Midoriya is who he is: a passionate, diligent man who constantly is working to learn from his mistakes and be a better person. When he comes with his idealistic hero philosophy and has to confront other people\u2019s philosophies, others who might be more cynical or unmoving, it shows the flaws in himself and how he thinks. Yet, every encounter allows him to build on his understanding of being a hero and the world around him. With this, Midoriya can release that true and tried raw emotion of his, to get his point across to those around him.\\n\\n\r\n\tA lot of this show is predicated on discovering what it means to be a hero. They take villains who are not mere caricatures, but hold their own ideals, and juxtaposes it against the heroes. Not just villains against heroes, but heroes pitted against each other too. What does it mean to be a hero? What should a hero do and not do? Are their limits to what a hero should be? Is it passion or power that drives a hero? Questions like these are constantly asked, but none of them in a heavy-handed way. It is all through the actions of the characters that we come to these questions. All of this through the lens of the infinitely lovable character of Midoriya who now must deal with the new challenges of what it means to be a hero and how will he learn to deal with his new power. While Midoriya is not a character that strays from the norm, I find it quite fitting that we see this story through his eyes. What undercuts all this is raw emotion. Something that I\u2019ve been talking about a lot here. When you see Midoriya cry after finally getting his quirk and scream when he finishes his training; when you see All-Might jump into battle after being inspired by Midoriya; when Bakugo walks off, all torn up in tears from realizing that his whole perception of life was misinformed. That is raw emotion. Pushing through despair; reflecting on your roots; having to humble yourself and reconcile with the truth. All this is the catalyst through which growth can be realized. The growth of building your confidence for becoming a hero; the growth of passing down your power and having to mentor others; the growth of accepting the truth and working towards what you thought you were. When you reach the moment of the growth of a character reaching its mark, you are left with an emotion and an idea. An idea and emotion that exists in that world and comes to a head back in reality. So, go out, go out and watch this show; be a hero through their scope. It may not be perfect, but it\u2019s truly great.\\n\\n",

            "content": "My Hero Academia was an anime that missed it's chance to be a good anime.\r\nIt's not like I really wanted to hate it. From the hype it was getting I expected something that would be enjoyable to watch, but unfortunately, it ended up being anything but that which was a huge disappointment. What initially drew me to the show was the superhero theme that the show was suppose to be going for which would've been all well and good had it not been for the characters, the way the plot played out, and most disappointingly the fact that this anime focused way too much onDeku and All Might.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not saying that having them as the main focus is a bad thing, but in the 13 episodes the anime had the other characters basically irrelevant to the point where the only thing that we learn about them are one or two personality trits and what their super power is. This brings up another issue I had with this anime and that is the way the characters were presented.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honestly, I found basically every character to be one dimensional cliches of your typical anime characters. Deku was a wimp that wanted to be strong, Bakugo was a jerk with an inferiority complex, and All Might was a Dues Ex Machina hero with super strength. Their traits were so stereotypical that I was able to predict what each of them planned to do in the episodes they were in which made my viewing experience less enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEven the so called plot was nothing more than reasons to make Deku looked like a competent hero when really he was just a typical protagonist that wouldn't think before he acted which almost got him killed on multiple occasions. Even in instances where there were less risky solutions he chose the options that no only put his own life in danger, but also left him with more damage than he should've taken because he could'nt control his power which would'nt have even been the case if he actually attempted to trained with his power to avoid all of the unnecessary damage he took which he obviously didn't. \\n\\n\r\nI will say that one thing this anime got correctly was that it wasn't trying to be more that what it should've been. All this anime was suppose to be was a shounen underdog anime which is definitely is, though I will say that in terms of execution it falls short on so many levels. I wished this anime took the time to showcase the other characters because they appeared to be more interesting than the ones we actually got to see in action. All I can really is that Academia is failed potential and with season 2 already confirmed I hope it will be better and actually give a reason to enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nWatch it if you want. but I won't make you.",

            "content": "Boku No Hero Academia is a very charming and lovable story about a boy, who dreams of being a superhero, despite being born without powers becoming the next symbol of peace. Its a charming hilarious story with attachable characters.\r\nStory: The story takes place in a school and we follow the students as they face different dilemmas in their world or just fun shenanigans at school. However, I feel the story arcs move quickly from one thing to the next. I wish it took more time and care to really flesh out what was happening at times more.\r\nArt: The animation is probably where this show fallsshort of. There isn't much art direction and its nearly always just daytime bright colours. Some frames look ugly and rushed. Honestly, it feels more like coloured in manga pages rather than its own stand-alone piece of art. Though with the episode count likely being over 100 in the end, comparing to other shows such as Hunter x Hunter and Haikyuu, it shows you are able to be consistent with the artwork and still have a large episode count.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The students are where you will get the most enjoyment out of this show. Watching them interact and grow as individuals and grow relationships with each other is where most of the enjoyment comes from. However, at times, some side characters feel a little one dimensional and a little forgettable, with only being in the show for comedic purposes, such as Mineta. The characters also fall short with the villains. I wish the villains would be more fleshed out with their ideologies and reasons for their beliefs. It feels rushed at times and I wish they took more care of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This show is really enjoyable. Its lots of fun and exciting to see the students grow and develop as people and as heroes. However, some of the other aspects such as inconsistent story, poor art and unfleshed out characters sometimes take away from that.\\n\r\nAlthough this show is enjoyable, I will be dropping it for the manga, as I feel the anime doesn't add much, other than the story being animated.",

Characters were stereotypes. I'm upset with Deku's impulsiveness albeit it was also the reason why Allmight took an interest on him. Still, there's a big difference between being a hero and being foolhardy -- being a hero does require one to forgo his own safety for the sake of other people, but doing that without as much as a well-thought-outplan is just plain stupid and reckless.\\n\\n\r\nThis is Hero Academia, though, meaning you will not find heroics here but rather students training to be a hero. Yup, this is a shonen anime that has a school setting. Later parts would have these kids prove their mettle as they stand their ground against a threat. Then again, there's no heroism involve in here. It's just them fighting for their own survival.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it is a typical shonen with some character development supposedly but that premise got betrayed early on as the main character didn't remain \"quirkless,\" a world of supers and non-supers that didn't get explored well, and a roster of powers that range from cool to meh.\\n\\n\r\nDid the first season made me thirst for more? A bit? Actually it was Stain (in season 2) that got me interested again with the series and... too bad he was just in for such a short time and my interest finally waned.",

Now, someone will think that Boku no hero a normal shounen anime But, we think that Boku no hero be better. \r\nthe My Hero Academia story tells as Izuku Midoriya will become a Hero. \r\nMidoriya is a cheerful but an extremely introvert middle school teenager who feels neglected by the society, 'cause he is born without  \"Quirks\". Quirks are something which has become a norm in the world of My Hero Academia. Nowadays most people born in the planet consist of the 80% of populationwhich mysteriously develop supernatural powers titled as Quirks. With Quirks some people can become a Heroes. Midoriya despite he haven't any quirks, he is fascinated by this world and, he would like to be his a hero too. This is the way of life portrayed in the series, and it revolves around Izuku, who is now one of those rare cases where there is no sign of a Quirk  in his body but, We just only say that thanks to \"All Might\" the Izuku's dream will be possible. Generally, The story take place very good and it give space to every single character, with flashbacks and motivations of why they want to become heroes.there isn't any principal character. All in this series are protagonists. High quality in every single scene, The opening and ending are awesome, The sound track are perfects every single moment in the story. There're sound for every single character and for every single battle and them all very amazing. every character has a different personality and them  can't miss very funny scenes. For finish, We love so much this series. We recommend to see it",

            "content": "Ah, Boku no Hero. Probably the shonen of the season. Aclaimed by many, is it that good? Let's see.\r\nStory: 6\r\nA normal kid with no powers wants to be a hero. This would be appalling and unoriginal as hell if everyone else have any powers too, but this is not the case. Everyone but him have a different kind of superpower, what allows the anime to emphatize the MC's fears and insecurities. The story flows smoothly since the first chapter\r\nArt & Sound: 7\r\nThe animation has that Gainax-ish vibe, making it enyoyable, but we don't have a lot of action here to truly shine this animation. Openingtheme and animation are good enough, being so catchy, and the soundtrack, well...has its moments, but follows nicely the way in the epic moments this series has.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThe MC is that archetype of character. Yes, i mean the untalented young boy who want to be the very best (in this case to be a hero and help others), doing his best effort to achieve it. However, while he's an archetype, he's a pretty good character and well developed. You feel his progress during the show. No stupid power-ups (hi Ichigo), just a boy making progress slowly, and that's kinda rare in a shonen.\\n\r\nBoku no Hero has many secondary characters: All Might, the best hero, is another archetype. Again, in this case this is not bad: All Might's mission is to inspire, to be the reference. And he does hella good.\\n\r\nDeku's classmates are well characterized but not developed at all just because the anime is incomplete, but you have an idea of their dreams and personalities with just a couple of arcs. Especial mention to Bakugo, Deku's childhood rival, always invaded by anger, that can by exhausting to see. But he's more than it seems, showing moments of wit and cold blood.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI enjoyed a lot this series, despite being short or a shonen. Well, i watched 9 episodes in a row, nothing more to say.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nThis is a good anime. Average story, while a bit original, good narrative, but the main problem is that is currently incomplete. Let's see if the second season fulfill the good expectations created in this one.\\n\\n\r\n\"Do you recommend this anime?\" Yes. especially if you are a shonen fan.\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Boku no Hero Academia, take a look to:\\n\r\n- Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, pure epicness with nice characters, story and narrative.\\n\r\n- Hunter x Hunter, probably, among One Piece, one of the best shounen series out there.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I enjoyed fighting/shonen shows, so you would know I enjoyed this show a lot. If you were to compare it, One Punch Man would have the closest setting to it, but this show would be psychologically more in depth. If you start comparing them, then you might underrate this show a lot. Now, that said, this is what I had to say about the show.\r\nStory (9/10)\r\nThis show, unlike most Shonen Jump shows, do a shorter episode length instead of \"Do it until the latest chapter\" style from older formats (The Big Three Shonen Jump shows being prime example), or the 25 episodes for more recentformat (say, Shokugeki no Soma or Haikyuu). Because of that, the pacing would be quite slow, as they are covering only two arcs of the manga, but rest assured, they make every episode worth watching. There was no filler episodes, everything is from the manga, and they were good. Talking about a powerless person in a superpower society setting? It's not like it has not been done before, the hero actually have to work for his power, and even after that still needs to master it, are quite...generic, but hey, it's a good formula and get you hyped up whenever we comes to the fight scene.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nThe artwork is good, but I almost thought they had to allocate the budget wisely, because there were times I thought things can be better looking, but hey, I'm comparing it with One Punch Man which does even better job at art. Also, because it uses a lot of American comic style when it comes to All Might, you might find the artwork shifts from time to time a lot.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\nI love the OP and EP, which is rare, considering they usually make one hype song and one not. But they did two fast soundtrack, and I kinda like it. Also, the battle scene BGM is quite hype.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10)\\n\r\nNow, despite having 2 arcs over 13 episodes, the background characters still require more screentime. Don't get me wrong, many have quite unique Quirks/abilities/superpowers. But aside from the few around the main characters, the whole class are not really memorable. And they are in like half of the season. And because the characters would not get their arcs until the second, third, maybe even fourth seasons (and even then more characters get introduced), just don't get too attached to the girl in the background until like the third season maybe.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show a lot, part of it because of how much tweaking they had to do to make the supposed 13 episodes. I know the story can be finished in less than 13, but the fact that I feel no filler was made (only added scene) makes me enjoy it a lot more. Also it does do some funny scene which made the whole series even better (Yeah, I always fall for the 'shonen fighting plus do some funny stuff to make things better' trap),\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nThis is a show I thought you can enjoy even if you don't like a lot of superheroes shows. The story may be generic, but it does not depict superheroes as the winner most of the time, which is something I thought makes it quite interesting. However, because it has to set up a lot of things for the future, it may be good if you pushed it aside until the next season is near (which there is).",

            "content": "TL;DR at the bottom in the form of Pros/Cons.\r\n*Contains some miniscule spoilers, none of which particularly affect the viewing experience*\r\nBoku no Hero Academia is the anime that took the Summer 2016 season by storm. With a rather popular source (a manga with the same name, published on the infamous 'Shounen Jump') and high production values, coupled with the fact that it was produced by Bones, BnHA was bound to be good - and it did not disappoint.\r\nThere have been many points that BnHA has been criticized for, the most common of them being that it lacks originality. Certainly, the story has a 'been there, donethat' feeling, since it features a bullied underdog protagonist in a world which looks suspiciously like something straight out of One Punch Man. What most people fail to notice is that under that clich\u00e9d exterior, it is so much more. BnHA is an anime that takes all things shounen, polishes it up and presents it with a twist of American comics thrown in. It manages to portray a vast array of emotions in a rather short one-cour time-frame.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10):\\n\r\nThe story of BnHA seems fairly typical to begin with. The first 2-3 episodes maintain a relatively slow pace, which makes some viewers turn up their noses at the series. Yet, these initial episodes are absolutely necessary to set up the world, introduce the most important characters and to explain Deku's past. After these episodes, the pace picks up considerably as it moves to the UA entrance arc. From then on, it's a roller-coaster ride of action and emotions (Or basically, all things shounen).\\n\r\nNote that the entire first season of BnHA is simply an introduction to the series and there is a ton of amazing content left to adapt. The best thing is that the anime adaptation is extremely faithful to its source.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\r\nJust goes to show what studios can do with a decent budget. The animation of BnHA, though not eye-candy like One Punch Man, is still very fluid and detailed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10):\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were both quite good, though the ED was quite a lot better. The soundtracks were right for each situation and nothing really felt overly jarring. In effect, it was fairly well done.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10):\\n\r\nThis is the one section where BnHA has gone above and beyond its competition. BnHA features a vast array of characters, each of whom has been given ample screen time. I cannot explain all of them (because I think there's some sort of word limit), so I'll be sticking to just three.\\n\\n\r\n-Midoriya Izuku (Deku): The protagonist of BnHA. He starts out as a weak teenager who is often bullied by his classmates, primarily by Bakugou Katsuki (Kacchan). Since he lacks a quirk, his peers consider him inferior, but his enthusiasm to become a hero just adds fuel to the fire. Deku's life changes (vastly for the better) when he meets his idol, the #1 hero, All Might. BnHA mainly focuses on Deku's journey to becoming a Hero, mostly on his time in High school.\\n\r\nDeku is a fairly well built character - an underdog from the start, hence not being in the least bit overconfident; courageous while knowing his limits; thinks his way through and possesses the drive to do his best. Though occasionally jittery and nervous, he is a likable character on the whole.\\n\\n\r\n-Bakugou Katsuki (Kacchan): Kacchan is Deku's childhood friend/enemy, who always makes it a point to look down on him. He was determined to be a genius right from when he was a child and the manifestation of a powerful quirk just added to his self-important nature. Kacchan considers himself above everyone else, which is partially true, since he is usually by far the best of his peers. His irritation with Deku started when Deku claimed that he also wanted to be a Hero, a role that Kacchan looked up to. Over the course of BnHA, Kacchan grows the become one of Deku's greatest rivals.\\n\r\nKacchan initially seems like a block of dumb muscle, but is revealed to have quite a lot of aptitude for coming up with strategies as well. His actions and behavior often hinge on his self-confidence and pride.\\n\\n\r\n-All Might: Everyone's idol, The Symbol of Peace, All Might is the world's #1 Hero. Deku has worshiped him from a very young age and is overwhelmed when they meet... but Deku soon realizes that there is more than what meets the eye when it comes to the Greatest Hero. All Might is the character who acts as catalyst and a gateway for Deku's journey to become the greatest. He plays the mentor for Deku in many ways, while being quite badass in general.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\\n\r\nAll said and done, it is undeniable that BnHA is a very enjoyable show. As someone who is a huge fan of the original manga, this adaptation felt almost panel-perfect. The last 3 episodes in particular, were exceptionally well done.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10):\\n\r\nBoku no Hero Academia, as stated before, is a very shounen anime. Many of the events and sequences in this anime can be predicted by those who have some understanding of how shounen anime work. Yet, this series excels in its execution to such an extent that most other flaws can be overlooked. BnHA is an excellent anime to watch in any situation, while being a very good starter anime as well (due to the Western Comic influences). Overall, it is a series that I would recommend to almost anyone.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR? Here's a quick summary.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Great production values\\n\r\n-Shounen done right\\n\r\n-Large cast of unique characters\\n\r\n-Even pacing\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Slow start (3-4 eps)\\n\r\n-May seem clich\u00e9d to those who have watched too much shounen",

            "content": "For all the reviews I am going to do,I am gonna keep them short and straight to  the point. I know I don't like when a review just rambles on about nothingness or a minor part of the whole anime. \r\n  So here for \"Boku No Hero Academia\" Produced by Bone Studios, known for Fulmetal Alchemist Brotherhood mostly, is a gorgeous, fun, uplifting, and inspiring anime. Many would say the story is generic. It is about a small weak main character who magically starts to be on the upcoming by some miracle event as the episodes goo on. Now, don't get mewrong I did say generic, but generic isn't always bad!! I absolutely love this style of anime. In fact, this is to me the most inspiring kinds of stories. I mean who doesn't love this stuff!?!  \\n\\n\r\nThe story to me is easily a ten. With the amazing idea of \"quirks\" and super powers really taking a stronghold for this anime. What made this story kind of unique was that the main goal of students was not to just go out and fight crime, but to get accepted into the best super hero school. Super hero school ? Some might say that is a bit corny, I actually agreed with that when it was first mentioned. But as later in the season shows, the tests these students go through are really intriguing. It shows the depth of the characters, the drive, their ambition, their heart, and their will to fight evil. It wasn't just some reading or writing, it was full on mental and physical anguish these student characters went through once in the school and during the tryout. Now yes there are some plot holes in the story (which I'm not going to spoil as you can see i haven't said specific characters). However, I know for a fact these will be filled up as the next season comes out and peaks my interest all over again.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: Not to much to talk about. To me just normal 2015-2016 anime art. Which obviously is gorgeous, but nothing unique or extraordinary. I did love the colors in some scenes. During certain scenes the art played an UNREAL role is setting the mood. Really making the viewer feel what they were supposed to feel. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Soundtrack was SOOOO IMPORTANT. I mean the anime is all about superheros right??? This anime had to have a good soundtrack or something would of been missing for the viewer right away. The music was so preicise with the scene it was mind blowing. I would think of music in my head as the scene was going on and then BAM! The music was playing perfectly with the scene. The sounds were great too. Well matched with the movements of the fights, explosions, punches, kicks, breathing, everything. ANNNND THE VOICES. I watched both the dub and sub. Now let me just say wow the dub was excellent. Every character had a beautifully matched voice. Congrats to all the voice actors. \\n\\n\r\nPS:  It was a combined superhero/anime music. I dont know how to put it. WATCH IT FOR YOURSELF IM SORRY ITS HARD. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10 easily. No doubt about it. Here I am gonna go into some detail but no spoiler I promise. \\n\r\nIzuku Midoriya: The main character in this anime. He is a very emotional young fellow who seems to really make you feel his emotions with every word and action he says or does. The viewer really does nothing but support him throughout the whole anime. Wishing the best for him and hoping he achieves everything he wants to. Extremely like-able and incredibly genuine. What a great character. YOU JUST WANT TO JUMP OUT YOUR SEAT AND ROOT FOR HIM THE WHOLE ANIME.\\n\\n\r\nAll Might:  I mean wow. He is a very love able character as well. Even makes you laugh a bunch throughout the series. I would say that if it wasn't for him cracking jokes, having a great personality, and genuinely caring for the people who fights for, he would seem extremely cocky and unlike able. But all those traits make you hop on the All Might train whenever he is kicking ass. He compliments Izuku well, showing how rare and uncommon Izuku's traits are. Making him the true main character we all love thanks to All Might.\\n\\n\r\nKatsuki Bakugou: I really do not know how to put him into words. He is an arrogant, self centered, egotistical, spoiled, jerk, over the top, and cocky character. But....but.... somehow, you still like him....because of how cool he and his quirk is. He is such a good fighter, his quirk is honestly awesome, and he just knows how to use his body in fights so well. I really don't like any bullies in anime. In fact, I usually hate their guts. However (sigh) I still like Katsuki. The vibes he gives off when he fights just makes your jaw drop. He is so damn powerful and you just want to see him show his true potential and win every time he fights. His anger is off the charts. Katsuki explodes at any slight comment and its quite hilarious. One of my favorite scenes derives from him being so angry.  Hopefully his personality changes DRAMATICALLY in the next season. YEA RIGHT. (There are tons of characters so I did the top 3). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I'm keeping this short. I mean I put a 10 for a reason right? I enjoyed this anime so much. At the end of the last episode I went outside and ran 10 miles since I was so motivated. I love inspiring anime and this was nothing but pure enjoyment since the first ten seconds of the first episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9. This anime is phenomenal but no masterpiece. Masterpieces are rare and this one was very close to it. Can't wait for the next season.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading. I will be doing a lot more on a lot of different anime's. Not just popular ones! Thanks :)\\n\\n\r\nBE SURE TO LIKE MY FACEBOOK PAGE  https://www.facebook.com/animecrewpage/",

            "content": "Boku no hero is an anime where it does not just involve the main character but all his classmates as well. One thing I enjoy and only thing I enjoy about this series is the ships. These wacky characters getting shipped is great. Oh I'd love to be one of those wacky characters. I would be like Bakugo but more agressive and only screaming \"treyway\". This iw aht so great about this anime it feels like you are a classmate witht ehse lovely characters. If you are rejected by your class at school this is perfect for you cause here you go with this newclass room with a frog, a mad person, a guy who has ice and is lit, and bird, and someone invisible and last but not least a guy with balls who throws his sticky balls onto people. Noyone likes that character because the idea of having sticky balls thrown at you reminds you of dodgeball at school where you are the last one picked and a bunch of sweaty balls are thrown at your face and in your face. To be honest I do not even know why this person is a character but I guess you need some short weirdo in the class. I mean in every class their is that one short weirdo always staring at the girls you see these people even in kindergarden. So the story is a 10 for me because I think it is great how Deku has a dream to become a superhero and this dood dont even have no powers but it shows how being a fan of someone is actualy worthwhile cause you can unlock they powers like link from legends of zelda. WOW IM SO FUNNY WITH MY REFERENCES. If you have not watched My hero academia yet than wow you must not know what anime is or even know what super hero is. My hero Academia is my 2nd favorite superhero kind of thing my first is Teen Titans Go. So anyway everything else is a 10 no need to explain just go watch it. Also add me as a friend on my MAL.",

Being a hero has always been high school student Midoriya Izuku\u2019s dream, and All Might, the greatest hero of all, is his all-time inspiration. Unfortunately, Midoriya learns that he possesses no Quirks and is fated never to become a hero at all. One day, he gets rescued by none other than All Might himself after being attacked by a villain. Little did he know that on that fateful day, he learned All Might\u2019s deepest secret, onethat would change his life forever and what it means to follow All Might\u2019s footsteps.\\n\\n\r\nPros: \\n\\n\r\nI. The characters are earnest, down to earth, and lovable.\\n\\n\r\nA. Midoriya \\n\r\nMidoriya is one character who shows what being a hero really means. Born without any Quirks, he gets a opportunity of a lifetime. With hardwork and dedication he his able to achieve his childhood dream of becoming a recognized hero, like his idol All Might. Literally brought me to tears watching him grow as a character. He deserves respect.\\n\\n\r\nB. Bakago\u00a0 \\n\r\nBakago is not a one dimensional rival.

Emotion\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why the characters are likable is because their personalities are explained, which makes them feel genuine.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\nI. Cast size/Screen time\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is the anime's greatest strength but just for a few a them. Not everyone is fully developed, even important characters like the main villain. Simply put there too many characters and just too little episodes. \\n\\n\r\nII. Weird pacing\\n\\n\r\nThe first half is kind of slow being all about Midoriya training and trying to become a hero. While the second half is high paced action, fighting real villains. Would have been better if it was maybe 26 episodes but it did officially get a 2nd season in 2017 which I am hype to see.\\n\\n\r\nIII. Cliche-ish\\n\\n\r\nThe story is the basic herose versus villians.",

            "content": "About 2 days after April 3rd, I saw a title that held a high rank in the popular section of the anime site I use. The animations for this title, was different than what I typically see. Despite some skeptical first thoughts, I clicked the title and began to watch the first episode. I am so thankful that I did so. \r\nBoku no Hero Academia is an amazing story. The Quirkless boy, Izuku Midoriya, tries to defy societies restriction. Izuku is an ambitious dreamer, but every since he was young society said his dreams to become a Professional Hero were without base and unrealistic.Though they're opinions are justified, Izuku just couldn't give up on his dreams. He storms after his dreams, and eventually meets All Might. Here, Boku no Hero academia peels away from the clich\u00e9s. Battle after battle, physical or psychological, Izuku fights through them. That's what I really loved about Boku no hero academia, even though he faced many obstacles in getting admitted into U.A high school, the battles don't end there. He needs to continue to work hard and show that he is worthy of being in a top school. That's where the real fight begins in chasing his dreams to become a top hero. \u201cI have to work a lot harder than other people!\u201d Izuku is aware of where he stands; he\u2019s at the bottom and barely making it through the hero training. Instead of being discouraged, he decided to work harder! Every struggle Izuku fights through, his tears of hard work, his face of disappointment, all of these moments, I as the watcher feel it as though I am right by his side. And every time Izuku succeeds with the amazing OST playing in the back, I want to go fight my own battles (figuratively). After every Sunday of watching the newly released episode, I felt really pumped to work my hardest for the coming week. I wanted to run even harder, I love Boku no Hero Academia because it inspires me to work harder toward my very ambitious dreams and goals. As Izuku surges forward, I realized that truly, success will shine through with enough hard work. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in Boku no Hero Academia is magnificent. The OST is able to capture the mood perfectly and made me feel like yelling \"Ganbatte!\" I love the ending song because it sums up the hard work expressed in Boku no Hero Academia into a rhythmic beat. Listening to the song makes me feel that I want to \u201cgo beyond!\u201d The opening took sometime to grow on me but it, too, is upbeat and I think that it expresses the tone in Boku no Hero Academia nicely. \\n\\n\r\nI have to say that I love Kaachan, All Might, Aizawa, and Izuku but I wish they spent more time on other characters. They do introduce all of Izuku's classmates but half of them I can't even remember their names, let alone their quirks. Some of them I forgot about their existence until the final episodes. They make all the classmates quite intriguing so it was a bit disappointing that they didn't invest as much time in the characters as I had hoped. I understand that it is a class of about 20 students, however there were few characters that naturally got more screen time (especially in the final arc) like Todoroki, Kirishima (I think was the guy's name), and Yaoyorozu (I just had to search her up to find out her name). These characters deserved more time than they were given but perhaps they are given that time in the original manga series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I loved Boku no Hero Academia because it is funny and weird but it definitely ignited a flame in me that makes me want to work even harder in almost everything that I do! Boku no Hero Academia teaches the resolve of making your dreams come true requires that you keep the flame of hope alive, then work hard to run after your dreams because that's how dreams come true; through the essence of hard work.",

            "content": "Imo the show kneecapped itself the moment Deku was given the quirk. Shonen is all about earning your power yourself and mastering it and the journey in that growth.\r\n From the get go supposedly what makes Deku the most qualified person is that he wants to be a hero despite not having power but in the show there's an entire police force of quirkless people that are motivated to serve others as much as Deku was so if All Might wanted to choose a quirkless kid there's really no reason for it to be Deku in particular. He could've just secretly chosen the best policeofficer since that just seems like the rational course of action if he was looking for a quirkless person with a strong sense of selflessness and civil duty. Deku's love for heroes doesn't really seem like a rare thing either. I'm pretty sure any young boy would also be obsessed with heroes and it's not like All might couldn't give his power to someone that already have a quirk so why not just give it to someone that has the proper motivation and could use All for One in conjunction with another power that compliments it well. Basically I don't really see Deku as an interesting or compelling character, I don't see any reason he was chosen in particular (other than it being forced by the narrative) and I don't care about his journey because he's just not an entertaining character.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that fucked the show is the contradiction in theme. In the first season one of the most emotional moments is Deku crying with the revelation that even he can be a hero. But really he could only become a hero because All Might chose him. The theme that anyone could be a hero is completely killed here. Anyone can be a hero if they're at the right place at the right time and the person that's choosing who gets the quirk pities them more than they care about doing the best they could possibly do with their duty. Fuck the police officers that probably went through a similar origin story to Deku and just came to terms with their lack of a quirk and decided to do the best that they could do within their limits I guess.\\n\\n\\n\r\nYet another thing I dislike about HeroAca is Deku's power. We already know what the power can be used for, so there's no real intrigue. Because of this Deku's development isn't interesting we know he's going to use it until he gets good at it. There are no powered up forms that he can enter or new techniques to develop just brute force. Yeah powered up forms are a icky but it's marginally more interesting than having a power with no cool techniques.\\n\\n\r\n There may be villains but we know there will be no real consequences since Deku becomes the number one hero anyway. \\n\\n\r\nGlaring plothole break: If Deku needs to be a good vessel to carry All for One how the hell is All Might carrying it. Dude is as lanky as a stick bug. Unless the muscles that he has in his All Might form are his in that case how the fuck does that work. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't even likeable in this show. They're all really simple, uninteresting characters. No one is asking anyone to reinvent the wheel with characters just make them feel human rather than husk-like. Deku wants to be a hero and is hardworking, Uraraka is also hard working and wants to support her family, Bakugo has a complex about being superior to everyone else especially Deku. Pretty much every character is really simple including the main character. I'm ok with side character's not being detailed in shonen of the focus is on the development of the main character but at least make the MC interesting. I'll compare this to something recent like Darling in the Franxx that while having characters that are generic the characters are at the very least written in a way that makes me care about them. Hiro is a pretty basic guy on the surface level, he wants to protect Papa and he cares about his friends. But his character reflects one of the central thematic conflicts of the story: Humanization vs Dehumanixation. In a world where children are assigned numbers he gives people names. Names being a concept that gives something a unique identity. Basically the children are treated like live stock while Hiro sees them as deserving of being treated like people. This idea contrasts with Hiro's ideals when it comes to piloting Franxx. He thinks that if you can't pilot you may as well be dead since you're useless to Papa. This conflict in his character reflects how he is affected by his interpersonal relationships and the society he lives in. His development as a character furthers the thematic conflict of the show which is what makes his character interesting. This, again, is compared to Deku who might reflect the societal ideal of having a cool quirk and hero, howerver, instead of defying this flawed ideal as a character he fully embodies it. When he had no quirk he was a worthless loser, now that he has a quirk he's a really popular hero (socially) only out-shined by Mr. Fire and Ice because he can use his power without breaking himself.\\n\\n\r\nHeroAca has a few things going for it. The chaacter designs are pretty cool and I see no issue with the quirk being somewhat spoiled since I'm a believer in the value of how they use quirk being matters. One might ask why I bashed Deku's power for being predictable is not only is the nature of the power really limited on what can be done but since it's the type of power that's passed down All Might will probably teach Deku all the techniques that there are to learn although there isn't really many to be had anyway.\\n\r\nAnother thing it has going for it is the theme of not all heroes are \"good\". Endeavor for instance is abusive and manipulative to forward his own goal of being the number one hero and Iida and his brother do what they do because it's a family thing. Point being that the motives for being heroes are selfish. Stain was an overdone but still quality villain.\\n\\n\r\nAnother side note: An official ranking system for heroes is fucking stupid. There's no use in explicating the most able hero a hero system would just need to know who's strong enough to handle certain type of scenarios. I can see an unofficial ranking system by fans or tabloids or something but there's no point in enumerating ability. Also the HeroAca system is never really explained is it based on ability or is it based on number of people saved? Is it a One Punch Man deal where your rank is upgraded by the level of threats you naturalize?\\n\\n\r\nAnyway despite it's flaws the show doesn't offend me and is well put together visually. When I started this rant I originally gave the show a 7 because it was alright and I was putting funish harems at 6. This show is the second to make me consider fixing my rating system but I'm too lazy. Either way I'm thinkin this show is a 6 due to it's boring cast, bad premise theme combination and general plot holes. \\n\\n",

The anime fandom was raving for more episodes and spreading the word of how good it was.

I grabbed my laptop and made it 10 minutes into the first episode before I closed the screen and told myself \"what garbage\", there's no absolute plot. Ah, I want to take my words back. Every anime has its pros and cons, comparing this anime to others does not do it justice.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing the world from a young person's eyes, their dream and aspirations; it reminds us of what we strive for as well.

            "content": "I really wanted to review this anime after completing the first season, mostly because initially I dropped it at around episode 10 or 11, only to decide that all of the hours I spent watching the earlier episodes would have amounted to a genuine waste of my time if I left it with 2-3 to spare. \r\nHonestly? The fact that this universe is inspired by US comic books is one of the reasons I picked it up after hearing friends and others in my immediate circle telling me how great it was. I trusted their opinions after enjoying shows like Free!, Yuri on ice etcetc and I've been watching superhero shows since I was a kid.\\n\\n\r\nI think my mistake was expecting this show to take its foundations in both superhero comics and shounen manga and add something new to the narrative styles of both. Unfortunately, this was not the case. BNHA is a pretty generic shounen with superheroes in the mix. Even more of a disappointment was the discovery that this show came from the same studio behind one of my favourite shows: Soul Eater. To be honest, I think Soul Eater is a prime example of the 'kids with powers\" trope and one of the few quirky shounen shows I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to spoil the plot at all, but I will say that there were so many missed opportunities in the story and the moments where it honestly shone were where it utilized the strengths of both genres. All Might's character arc was honestly fascinating, whereas the central plot of Deku and his quirk or lack thereof was incredibly weak. For me, it took the fact that Deku had worked harder than everyone else and made it irrelevant and therefore more difficult to root for him. Later points where you are genuinely meant to root for him honestly felt very stale. Speaking of which, I'll admit I've never read the manga for this show so it may be different there, but in the anime there came a point where events picked up and I was meant to root for the kids in Deku's class... but honestly outside of him, All Might and maybe Kacchan, I didn't feel attached enough to any of them for it to work\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't a bad show, but any means (I sat through the debut of Black Clover), but it's just not as unique and interesting as I hoped it would be when I first started watching. As I write this, I'm watching the second season on Crunchyroll and I'm hoping the story picks up from there.",

Midorya then gets to attend the prestigious U.A. High School to train to fight villains.\r\nAlmost everything works for this colorful, fun, intense, intelligent, and meaningful anime. The characters are universally a delight with each one having interesting quirks, which contribute totheir identities and help to lend depth. Our protagonist, Midoriya, is sweet but clever and powerful, and the way his new quirk is too powerful for his body, causing him to be constantly injured, is fascinating to watch. Shoto Todoroki has an amazing and horrifying backstory to his half-fire, half-ice quirk. Katsuki Bakugo transitions from being a bully to an insecure hero. Ochaco Uraraka is bubbly but with an undercurrent of steel. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is excellent, with never a dull moment or a filler episode. The fight scenes are stunningly choreographed and never filler: each one advances the plot or character development in meaningful ways. Even the overarching message of bettering yourself in order to help others is an important one that is well-presented. \\n\\n\r\nThe only issue is the very occasional annoying fan-service element of sexualizing a handful\u2014certainly not most!\u2014of the female characters (Mt. Lady, Midnight, Momo). But the fan-service at least doesn\u2019t seem to prevent their character development: in fact, their confidence in their bodies is presented positively. In addition, a student (Mineta) who insists on sexually harassing others is called out on it and generally presented in a negative light. \\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s hoping to many excellent seasons ahead for this anime.",

            "content": "For a shonen style show, this was by far one of the better ones I've seen recently. THERE WERE EVEN MOMENTS OF ACTUAL TENSION!\r\n=== STORY ===\r\nEven though the story follows the same general path as most underdog, shonen stories, the interesting thing with this one is the MC doesn't ever end up ridiculously overpowered. At the end of the season, he's strong, but is still learning to use his powers, and still relies heavily on the other characters in the show to help win battles.\r\nThis type of MC in a show isn't super shocking and original, but it's refreshing to NOT have one that's superOP and is automatically a chick magnet. There were moments of real suspense and tension, because I wasn't always sure how the MC would get out of a sticky situation. There were no ex-machina powers or characters that popped up in the middle of a fight to get the autowin, and there were enough loses that the fights actually were valuable to the storytelling.\\n\\n\r\n=== ART ===\\n\r\nThe art was good, and there were plenty of fun to watch fight scenes. To be a bit nit-picky, I felt like the style was a bit too childish (i.e. the colorscheme had very bright primary colors), for the mood of the show, but I see how they were trying to appeal to nostalgic audiences of older kid's cartoons.\\n\\n\r\n=== SOUND ===\\n\r\nNot a whole lot mentioning here. The soundtrack was not distracting, but didn't particularly stand out. Same goes for the OP and ED. I thought the voice acting was fine too.\\n\\n\r\n=== CHARACTER ===\\n\r\nThe show had a fairly fun cast of characters. None of them where amazing, but there were some fun interactions between them. I especially liked All Might, and his struggle since his OP super powers were limited by a past injury. Plus he's just a fun character that made me laugh.\\n\\n\r\nI found the MC too whiney, throughout the season, which was enough to dampen my enjoyment of the show. He was crying/whining all the time, which grated on me.\\n\\n\r\n=== ENJOYMENT/OVERALL ===\\n\r\nI liked this show a lot. It's nothing brand new or original, but it does the shonen formula way better than most other animes. Of this season's anime, Boko no Hero Academia definitely ranked in the top 5 for me.",

            "content": "Boku no Hero Academia being the underdog story where the main character weak starts as a wimpy weak character and no one believes in his strenght but by through cheer force of will becomes against the odds strong and what he ambitioned to be. The problem with that perspective in Boku no Hero is that people have done it before and better.\r\nThe worst part of the anime is that all the sencondary characters are walking stereotypes or plain dull, none of them is interesting, developed or given a backstory, all their motivations, including the main character Izuku are I wanna become a hero or incase of the villains is do bad by killing the symbol of justice. That is a rather big issue since other underdogs like Naruto took their early watch time to give secondary characters motivations, personalitys and backstorys. You might complain that the show has a second season coming and that they probably will develop their characters more along the way. But after the introduction arc they decided to instantly jump to an action packed one where they as begginers need to fight villains, ignoring the fact that they can actually beat most of them for some reason even tho they are kids and beggining their hero course, that tells us that the show doesnt have the task of developing their characters in the agenda.\\n\r\nThat also brings another bad thing protrayed about the show, the heroism, to become a hero the academy clearly dont take into account your skills for saving other people or your actual mentality since for example Bakugo that has a personality of a villain is admitted to the hero course and they pass most of their time fighting like in the entrance exam like that\u00b4s what makes a hero in the show for some reason.\\n\r\nBut it\u00b4s not like the show doesn\u00b4t have any merit it brings drama in to a tee, and its climax due to the pacing and the buildup is really entertaining having even some emotional grip it\u00b4s just a bummer that the story and the character dont amplify properly the emotional stakes of that climax. Also the power levels of the show are not well defined in episode 7 they keep claiming that if the fight goes on someone will get killed, if that\u00b4s true than why are they competing in the first place? If Izuku simply uses \"his\" ability to attack Bakugo he will probably die or if Bakugo uses all his strenght Izuku may die but at the end he takes an attack directily on and nothing happens am I suppose to take the fight seriously that way? And it\u00b4s a shame since the moment was so well animated and had a big impact in the story and Bakugo\u00b4s character. When you are just watching without thinking much it\u00b4s a great compelling scene but in the long run it\u00b4s a mess just like the all show it has way too many plot conveniences Izuku is given the strongest ability in the world just because he wants it so badly, All Might says he is at his limit but when he sees Izuku rushing in he must gain some kind of durability boost or something because he still helps disregarding what the word \"limit\" means. And all the plebs keep hyping it.\\n\r\nIn Conclusion Boku no Hero Academia doesnt deserve the hype and it\u00b4s fandom ruin what it could possibly be a very entertaining watch full of emotionally griping moments even if the reason behind them isn\u00b4t the best.",

Let me explain.\r\nStory & Writing: 8.5/10\r\nCharacters: 7.5/10\r\nAnimation: 4.5/5\r\nSound: 3.5/5\r\nAvg: 8/10\r\nIn the first half of this show, it's mainly build-up. It covers a lot of time and deals with world-building and slight character development, but also a crap-ton of anime overreaction and excessive whining.\r\nBut don't turn it off!! Not only does it consistently break trope, meaning that you never really know what to expect from any action sequence, but in the second half, the writing of each battle is exquisite, entertaining, and a creative achievement.\r\nWhen Isay that not a lot happens it means that a lot of this season focuses on tiny increments. It takes one battle or one major crisis and breaks it up into 2-4 episodes and lets it play out while you're in the characters' heads. While you have a clear main character, the others are well-developed and you find your favorites.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is excellent. The English dub is likely inferior due to the incredibly annoying voice of the main character, but it shines in many other areas. They did not skimp on this show. What holds my rating back was a sloppy first 4-5 episodes, but the show really found its stride and hit a home run to the end.",

            "content": "Boku no Hero Academia (My Hero Academia in English). One of the greatest anime in 2016, made by Studio Bones. This anime gained a lot of popularity in this 2 years and many people recommend this anime. I've watched it and I decided to make a review on it\r\n****THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS****\r\nSTORY (7/10)\r\nThe story is similar to a classic shounen anime. The main character who is weak, trying to be the greatest hero and training to accomplish his dream. In the beginning, the MC learns that he doesn't have any powers,meets his idol (All Might) which he helps the MC a lot, givinghim his quirk. The MC have his new powers, enters the UA High School, the best school for heroes, and, last, he made a rival, who is his childhood friend. A classic shounen anime. But, the anime has a difference, the MC saves his rival from a villain and gives an impression to his idol.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also similar to classic shounen characters. Midoriya Izuku, the MC, is a brave boy, has ambition and he tries to follow his dream. He is timid and calm, he works hard and he is smart, that's why he made it to enter the UA High School. In the development of the story he learns a little bit how to control his powers, which make him stronger and braver. Bakugo Katsuki is the MC rival. He is very strong, one of the strongest in his class. He wants to be the best hero and wants to surpass All Might. He sees Izuku as a rival because Izuku has a strong quirk ( super power) and slowly he learns how to use it. This thought gives Bakugou a feeling of anxiety beacuse he thinks that isn't now the strongest. That's why he sees Izuku as a rival. Bakugo is smart, nervous and a little bit arrogant. Classic type of rival in a shounen anime\\n\\n\r\nART (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art was great!! The colours and the graphics had a high quality. The surroundings, the body shapes, the moves, the costumes and the characters, in genera,l were great. The animation had a great quality. The details had, also, very high quality. They made a very good job on art.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was, also, great. The opening of this anime is one of my favorite. The ending was good too. The soundtracks of the fights were awesome. Last, the voice actors were very suitable for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT(7/10)\\n\\n\r\nI liked this anime. I had a good time watching this. I, also, think that this anime can become even greater in the future. This was only the first season and it had a great success. The story may be a little similar to a classic shounen anime but the art and the sound make the anime to be different from them. The art and sound is worthy for an anime of 2016. I recommend this anime to everyone who wants to see a shounen, action, super power anime.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (9/10)",

But like many other Shounens out there, some issues are present but this is masked by other factors I found enjoyable.\r\nLet's think about one of the most famous conflict found in entertainment history. Superheroes vs Supervillains. That's the core of what Boku no Hero Academia is all about. We have a main character with a dream of being a hero, filled in a modern world where 80% of the population have some form of unique superpower. However, this comes with aside effect of other beings driven by evil desires and with their own power, becoming the villains. But before the story delves further into this conflict, the characters are introduced first. They're pretty much eccentric and quirky, which at first I find myself annoyed at some of them but as I watch more episodes, I've warmed up to them by the end of the show. Each of the character gets their own spotlight, particularly with a character in the first half of this season, developing and exposing more of their history. The only thing that irritates me slightly is the repetitive phrase from the main character, but I'm used to this from watching longer Shounens. Oh, I almost forgot to say this but they tried really hard in the comedy aspect. Only a little portion worked and did made me laugh.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, comic-style art is what I thought of when I first see it in color. It might not be a suitable art style for some of us but personally, I found it to be fitting for the theme of 'Superheroes vs Supervillains'. In its own way, it's very unique compared to other anime. To further refine the characters, their designs were made to be really interesting and different from each other. You also can experience the feel of a modern society in which the anime takes place in, with all the skyscrapers, roads, and technologies. There are a lot of great OSTs used, sad or hype, you name it. The voice actors didn't fail their roles and I wonder if that guy's VA has lost his voice during one of his sessions (you'll know what I mean when you watch it). But jokes aside, for the most parts the animations was average at dialogues but Bones nailed them during most of the fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nBoku no Hero Academia started off great in its first season. Story-wise, nothing much did happen as it focused on the main character and other characters first of all, but it was set up nicely for future plot developments. It's definitely another good anime to watch for all Shonens viewers out there and for first-timers to get a taste of what its genre is like.",

            "content": "Boku No Hero Academia\r\nWhere to even start\u2026\r\nWell I\u2019d like to debut by saying that this review will be covering both seasons of the show. Although it has been confirmed that the series is to continue for yet another instalment, I seriously doubt it\u2019ll change much of what will be said within this opinion piece. In a nutshell: Boku No Hero Academia just doesn\u2019t cut it, for me at least, and I would like to explain my reasoning, so here goes: The reason why this series falls short is because it\u2019s a shounen.\r\n -*Wait Vishi! Is that the only reason why you don\u2019t like the show?!?*-\r\nOk,ok\u2026let me rephrase that\u2026It\u2019s a shounen eh!?!?\\n\r\n-*FacePalm*-\\n\\n\r\nI say this because the shounen genre, in general, has this tendency to create an ever-expanding world setting that, in all honesty, requires a god-awful amount of time to anchor itself into place. Hero Academia, falls right into that molding but, regrettably lacks the time to flourish into something marvelous. Quite frankly, I don\u2019t believe this show will garner the support needed to elongate its existence within the realm of anime. Put differently, I\u2019m betting this show\u2019ll sink after S3: and this will effectively prevent it from gaining momentum in its story telling.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the content being shown throughout is underwhelming, worsening its \u201craison d\u2019\u00eatre\u201d and adding to my initial presentiments. Exceptions can be made, however, for the show\u2019s first few episodes. More exactly, I\u2019m talking (err typing) here about episodes one through four: they\u2019re amazing! Basically, I fell in love with the start, grew tired of the rest. From the beginning, the series exposes us to an MC, hereby named Young Midoriya, who has this unrivaled admiration for all heroes: yup! The show\u2019s about a boy living in a society that has professionalized the hero trade. Citizens, those whom have been chosen, are granted, from birth or during infancy, super-natural powers or \u201cQuirks\u201d; and most eventually find interest in using those abilities for heroic deeds by educating themselves into becoming \u201ccertified heroes\u201d. Our MC is one such hopeful except, he lacks any sort of Quirk.\\n\\n\r\nFrom this premise alone, we get to appreciate the unsurmountable challenges that Young Midoriya has had to face. It\u2019s David versus 50 goliaths\u2019 as our protagonist fights with two opposing forces within his very own being: The realist in him constantly urges the boy to give up on these foolish dreams of becoming a hero, while the dreamer inside simply can\u2019t settle for anything else. This conflicting nature is addictive! I saw myself in him, I could relate: So, I was pulled in! Above all heroes he so vehemently fawned over, young Midoriya was most enamored with All Might: The number one hero in the world! So, although constantly reminded by what he lacked, our wannabe hero found solace in everything His idol embodied: serving as a symbol he could rally behind. At this point I\u2019m just crying, because I saw this boy\u2019s drive to become a better person, and lauded his eagerness to find his own definition of \u201cwhat being a hero\u201d truly meant.\\n\\n\r\nSounds good, right? Well it ends there. Seriously everything else is all just a big blur. Though I don\u2019t have it in me to demean the continuance of the show post-Episode 4. I also don\u2019t have anything to say about it that might encourage someone to start on this, if not for the beginning. The humor is monotonous. The atmosphere is always so quirky. Most villains (the antagonists if you will) are lame, both in character and quirk (although the last episode introduced some nice additions to the \u201cbad guy(s)\u201d category; alas they remain a mystery as the show didn't bother fleshing them out). The plot made us question so much, as curiosity requires, but does very little in answering anything as it progresses. I don\u2019t know, I started losing faith mid-way through. The most annoying thing was when I started realizing that the MC was getting upstaged by a supporting character: Todoroki I\u2019m looking at you honey - if you\u2019re gonna try and steal little Mido\u2019s shine you can just leave and make your own anime series. What a prick that guy. Okay\u2026 Take a breather Vishi, inhale and ex\u2026hell maybe I did have it in me to demean Boku No. I\u2019m sorry. Had to let it out.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I didn\u2019t appreciate how Hero Academia tried emulating Naruto\u2019s chunin exam, and Dragon Ball\u2019s martial arts tourney. The appropriation of ideas from other series is fine, but this was sloppy: the outcome being totally different from what those series tried depicting in their respective arcs, you got the feeling that the writers were trying to be clever with it, but failed miserably. I highlighted two examples, but sloppiness is a recurring theme here, taking away from my enjoyment of the overall work that is Boku No Hero Academia.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'll start tackling into the poor story (nothing much to say tbh. It's cliched, boring and non innovative on any aspect) or the viewer betrayal that occurs at ep 2 where Midoriya tells us that he is already the best hero on the world and everything went well in the end. This is something that every shounen watcher is fully aware of in the inside of their kokoros, but we try to pretend that is not true, we try to believe the story that is presented and we pretend that the heroes are in actual danger to enjoy the story even more.\r\nWe know that Gokuwill come to crush the villains skull and revive everyone with the dragon balls, we know that Naruto is going to become a hokage, etc. It's something well known in the genre but BNHA spoils the journey right from the beggining. It also adds salt in the wound because an adult Midoriya tends to talk from time to time to reminds us that he will never be in real danger (if BNHA is something that's being narrated like HIMYM then why can we see and hear stuff that Midoriya cannot see or hear? Or scenes where he is not in...)\\n\r\nAside from that the female characters being higschoolers with big tits is disappointing. People told me that the characters were well constructed and weren't just walking fanservice but at the very least on this first season they are.\\n\r\nFrom all of the cast only Iida, Bakugo and Mineta were slightly interesting to watch.\\n\r\nI wanna see what everyone is such a big fan of so i'm definitely going to see the season 2.\\n\r\nI consider this to be a \"preview\" anime (like Re:Zero where nothing actually happens and we just get introduced into the world). But for being one it was really fine. Nothing praiseworthy (oof i'm lying! The scene on ep 2 where All Might talks with Midoriya was completely enjoyable) but nothing too insulting to be disgusted after watching it.\\n\r\nIt's a kid show after all (not even one of the good ones), nothing more nothing less.\\n",

            "content": "Tried to get into it because I was bored but had to drop this because I couldn't stand to watch another episode.\r\nCharacters\r\n- Winy MC is so winy, he'd cry if you took away his candy. Seriously. Most shoujo heroines are not as winy (and I still hate them o.\u00f4; )\r\nThere's just a limit to how much an MC can cry. I think there's not a single episode where Deku is not sniffling or crying at some point. Don't get me wrong, I don't even mind the occasional emotional outburst...but here it just got to a point where it was plain annoying. Remember DBZ little Gohan?Thought that was annoying? Deku is a 15 years old crying like 4 year old Gohan.But we're supposed to see him as the next big hero and root for him? Sorry, while I may root for a kid that's trying to surpass its cry-baby mentality, we're talking about a teenager here...So it's just annoying.\\n\\n\r\n- Psychotic rival character is case for the loonies\\n\r\nDeku's childhood \"friend\" is non other than the childhood-bully. You know, that one kid that is always portrayed as needing to torment and make fun of others to feel superior? Again... this over-the-top stuff may be believable for kindergardeners but in this case... Ugh.... He just seems like he's lost some of his marbles. And the tip of the iceberg? Deku still idolizes that guy and follows him like a lost puppy. Heck, it's no wonder there are so many yaoi doujinshis about them out there... One acts like a total sadistic tsundere seme and the other like the begging-for-it-don't-hurt-me-but-you're-still-so-smexy-I'll-follow-you-everywhere uke. And I'm saying this as someone who does read and enjoy the occasional yaoi. In this settings their characters are just too much and ughhh... \\n\\n\r\n- Girls only existing in this series to have *some* fan service. That pink suit with the stripe *cough* slot down there...really? Was that necessary? Those are 15 year old kids. Yet they all have a C+ rag and every last one of them is in the story only to add a pair of big tits and butt. Most of their quirks also carry some innuendos. Like that girl who's invisible. So she runs around naked all day only wearing gloves. Or did I mention the girl who pops out things between her tits? Or the girl with the incredibly long tongue...? Yeah, you get the drift. If you're looking for sexism - here it is. I don't mind if there is a fanservice scene or two. But when all the girls and women are portrayed like this it makes me freaking mad. I've seen scenes and images from other scenes throughout the series and I really haven't seen even a single female character that is not somehow sexualized.Heck, the even have an entirely naked girl pinning down the MC and licking him? At some point that became too much.\\n\r\nThere's even this \"kid\" character who goes around molesting or trying to molest females in nearly every episode. This is supposed to be \"fun\" apparently. It just pissed me off. You can have a \"pervert\" in a manga/anime without it being so darn tasteless. Think of Miroku (Inuyasha) for instance. But the portraying and length of the scenes and how they're packed into the context/the other characters' reaction does influence how they are perceived. In BHA it's not funny anymore. It's just plain annoying, tasteless and sexist.\\n\\n\r\n- Ridiculous costumes are ridiculous\\n\r\nI was never a fan of Marvel character designs but this... ugh.... most of the characters are probably designed to look that way in a bid to be \"funny\" or w/e. It just takes off the entire series as I can't take any of them serious. And in the case of females, the ridiculousness is topped with sexism. Every damn one of them has to wear skin tight suits with high-heel shoes to emphasize their tits and butts. Most of them don't even get enough clothing to make for a full body suit, so they have to show off their rag.\\n\\n\r\n- The characters overall lack depth. Even fan service galore manga/anime like Shokugeki no Soma explore their characters better, give them a backstory and motives; make them likeable and dislikeable for certain aspects and all that. BHA barely gives you anything even for the \"main\" characters.  \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nArt-wise this neither especially good nor bad. However the style is much simpler than for other anime/manga, so it's also a lot easier to animate as you have less lines and details et cetera. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThis is more or less one of the few redeeming features of this anime. The seiyuus are mostly well chosen and do a great job. The soundeffects are on par and the soundtrack is nice in most cases.\\n\\n\r\nStory, Enjoyment and overall impression\\n\r\nPossibility-wise this could have been entertaining. While it never had the potential to be something I really liked (as I don't click with Marvel that much), it could have been a way to kill time.. But the execution... ugh... From blatant sexism over sniffling wanna-be-yet-don't-wanna-be-yaoi-boytoys... Ugh... I could have enjoyed this to some extent if they toned down the sexism and made the main character a bit more likeable. I don't care about the \"getting super powers without doing slack to deserve it\" part as much. I could imagine someone with a personality similar to Mahiru (Servamp) in this setting for example. He was also more of a silent force type that was hard-working and a bit timid in a way. But Deku....I can only see him as a wanna-be-adult version of 4 y.o. Gohan. :/",

            "content": "I first ran into this anime from a YouTube video by jackontc, whom I knew from his One Punch Man theme recreation. The video was a recreation of You Say Run from the BnHA soundtrack, and I just had to find out what kind of anime would have such kick ass music in it. At the time, it was #1 for hottest new anime on KissAnime so I decided to go ahead and join the bandwagon...\r\nThis is a typical Shonen anime showcasing a plot device that a majority of anime fans should be very familiar with: the underdog story. Because of this, many people havedropped or disliked this anime, and I don't blame them because it's good reasoning. Boku no Hero has its flaws, but it still deserves  justice. I really enjoyed watching it, and for many key reasons.\\n\\n\r\nOne, the plot is unoriginal, but it's NOT uninteresting. Countering its plot device, the developers did a great job on resisting the intent on making the storyline drag. I can easily compare this to Naruto Shippuden, which is what I basically describe as \"watered-down\" anime, or an anime that tries very hard to be good, but its execution is poor. Boku no Hero Academia fits into this category, but the execution is the complete opposite. This anime is exciting and a boatload of fun, which can easily outweigh unoriginality. I felt like I was being taken back to the good days of childhood anime like Dragonball Z or Pokemon, where the anime didn't necessarily have to have good plot devices to be fun to watch. This is different from other anime you may watch. This is completely straightforward in every aspect and doesn't drag.\\n\\n\r\nTwo, the action sequences are hype as hell. Long story short, All Might vs. Nomu = best anime fight of 2016. I'm a huge sucker for action sequences that are wonderfully animated and give viewers the \"epic\" feeling of a fight. All Might vs Nomu was a perfect example of that, and makes a powerful impact on my psyche. All of the other action sequences do the same, but just not as heavily as the final battle. Each action scene was is dazzling and highly entertaining to watch and pretty much just defies so many other Shonen anime that poorly attempt to give the audiences high-quality action.\\n\\n\r\nThree, the music. This was the whole reason I started watching the anime in the first place, and it plays an insanely heavy role in the anime itself. Whenever \"You Say Run\" played in the anime, I turned my volume to the maximum. It's an absolutely fantastic song and brings the feeling of sheer power to every action scene. This motivated me to Pre-Order the soundtrack on CDJapan and I'm heavily satisfied with the music. There's a few generic and casual songs on it, but a healthy amount of epic and inspirational pieces that I should rank to give you an idea on the stuff you want to listen to.\\n\r\n1: You Say Run\\n\r\n2: \u541b\u306f\u30d2\u30fc\u30ed\u30fc\u306b\u306a\u308c\u308b (You Can Be a Hero)\\n\r\n3: \u8105\u5a01\u3068\u306e\u653b\u9632 (Offense and Defense of the Threat)\\n\r\n4: Plus Ultra\\n\r\n5: \u30f4\u30a3\u30e9\u30f3\u306e\u4fb5\u653b (Villain Invasion)\\n\r\n6: Hero A\\n\r\n7: \u66b4\u8d70\u3059\u308b\u60aa\u610f (Uncontrollably Evil)\\n\r\n8: jackontc's recreation of You Say Run\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a perfect anime, but it's damn fun to watch. If you feel like you're running low on good anime to watch this year, give this a chance. Boku no Hero Academia has so much potential, even enough potential to become a masterpiece, and I honestly hope for that to happen. If it doesn't, though, I still won't be disappointed because this anime is already impressive on its own. \\n\\n\r\nWorth watching? Hell yes. Go watch it.",

            "content": "The Details: My Hero Academia (Boku no Hero Academia) is an action/shonen anime based on a manga by Kohei Horikoshi. The anime ran for 13 episodes during the Spring 2016 season. \r\n(Contains mild spoilers)\r\nThe Story: In a world where most of the population has superpowers (called Quirks), Izuku \"Deku\" Midoriya has always dreamed of becoming a great hero. There's just one problem: he doesn't have any powers of his own. But after a chance meeting with All Might, the greatest hero in the world, he might just get the strength he needs to overcome the odds and become the hero he's always wanted to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe Good Stuff: \\n\r\n-Okay, you'll pretty much know exactly where this story is going if you've ever watched a shonen series or a superhero movie. Despite that, it's still really well executed. You can have an amazing premise and not do anything worthwhile with it (*cough*SAO*cough*), or you can have a played-out, somewhat cliched premise that you work with and get something that, if not all that original, is still really good, and My Hero Academia \\n\r\ndoes a great job at this. \\n\\n\r\n-I really like most of the characters. Izuku is a bit of a crybaby, but he keeps pressing on despite the fact that nearly everyone expects him to fail at first, and he actually shows some decent tactics and strategy when it comes to the fights he gets into. All Might is awesome, and his relationship with Izuku is rather touching and has some very sweet moments, especially at the beginning of the series. Iida and Uraraka are also very easy to like (and in Iida's case, hilarious). My favorite side character is probably Tsuyu, who I really want to see more of, thanks to her unique power and laid back personality. \\n\\n\r\n-The opening theme is catchy and fun. \\n\\n\r\n-The art is colorful and nice to look at, and I liked the unique character designs. \\n\\n\r\n-The final fight scene at the end with the villains was awesome. Parts of it reminded me of One Punch Man. \\n\\n\r\nThe Bad Stuff: \\n\r\n-Bakugou. I really didn't like him. He seems to be set up as a rival to Izuku, but since Izuku isn't all that powerful yet, he usually just comes across as a bully. He's made slightly more bearable by the fact that some of the other characters do make fun of his less desirable character traits, and he does get a couple of cool moments in the last few episodes, but that doesn't change the fact that he was pretty insufferable for most of it.\\n\\n\r\n-There's a lot of buildup and not much payoff. Especially glaring are a couple of episodes in the middle of the series where not much important happens (episode 5 was probably the worst one in this regard). Granted, the last few episodes were really cool, but I did spend a fair amount of the series wondering when the plot was going to take off. \\n\\n\r\n-The soundtrack was kind of forgettable, as was the ending theme. \\n\\n\r\n-The villains that came in at the end were a little flat. Can't fault this too much, as they are being set up for bigger and likely badder things, but aside from their cool powers, they were kind of generic. \\n\\n\r\n-The ending left a lot hanging. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\r\n\"Fun\" is probably the best way to describe My Hero Academia. There's nothing particularly groundbreaking to be found here, but it has some cool fight scenes, some likable characters, and a pretty neat world.",

            "content": "I probably would've given it an even higher score if it had had more episodes - just a few of the characters were still left a little under developed and it only really started to get exciting when the last arc with the villains happened (I was pretty excited anyway, even before the villains showed up, as I wanted to see them do actual rescue simulations too, but before that I was getting a little bored).  \r\nThe show boasts some incredibly interesting characters - Katsuki Bakugou, and the villain, Shigaraki Tomura - whose motivations and characters I'm really interested in learning more about; Idon't think I've ever come across characters like them (although the only one I really like out of the two of them is Bakugou, even though he's so mean!). The rest of the characters are really fun, too, and are extremely likable (or annoying, but sort of funny, in Mineta's case) - even the girl characters are so great and actually have a load to them, which is always a worry I have going into shounen and there's quite a lot of girls in this as well (unlike most shounen). Thus far, none of them have simply just been a damsel in distress, they all have their own power and are really good at using it. \\n\\n\r\nEven though it was so short it still managed to make me like a lot of the characters (even though I would have liked more on some of them), still managed to have a lot of emotion and heart (I was already crying by the end of the second episode - that could just be because I'm a crybaby, but it was still good at doing it), still managed to be incredibly funny (Aoyama's last line in this season made me laugh so hard) and give a good story which has captured my interested - also the character designs are really cool!! \\n\\n\r\nMy only negatives would be that:\\n\r\n- Izuku is a teensy bit boring, he's still really sweet and I like him!!! His timid nature makes him stand apart from other shounen leads, but I think he still needs a little more to really be bit more interesting (he just has too many of the facets of a usual shounen lead, which is fine, but I think he needs a little more to make him stand out - which hopefully come over time). \\n\r\n- Normally pacing doesn't bother me as I know the beginning is generally a little slow as they have to introduce us to the world and the characters, but I have to admit that I was a little bored in parts (it was the beginning that hooked me, but then I only really got excited again when the last arc came about - there was still definitely some good parts in-between, but the pacing was so slow)\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's about it, I really liked it otherwise.  \\n\\n\r\nIt may seem a little a similar to a lot of other series, but it really does come into its own and has a really good, and interesting story to tell with a cast of great characters. I liked it quite a lot, and will be getting onto the next season soon :) \\n\\n\r\nScore: about a 7.5 from me, and I hope that season 2 can only build on this.",

            "content": "After hearing about all the hype behind the third season of Boku no Hero, I decided to get my normie ass through the first two seasons and see if the third is any worth watching. And, well... While the first season wasn't all that terrific, it shows some promise for the next two seasons, which I have happily moved closer to the top of my PTW list. Here is my short, no bs review.\r\n(I rate anime a little differently, and am currently working on a explanation on my page. In short, I consider Plot and Story to be separate entities, and include the op/ed inthe rating.)\\n\\n\r\nOP/ED: 7/10 \\n\r\nGreat op, avg ed.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10 \\n\r\nGood during emotional parts, but nothing special everywhere else. But that's where the music needs to be good, right? So I gave it a bit more credit for that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10 \\n\r\nWhile there was a very big cast, it was a little too much for a 12 ep show. So we got the least amount of characterization on the side characters, that were actually interesting. The main characters were quite bland, with the creativity seen in some of the superpowers of the supporting characters, I was expecting something better from Deku and All Might.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10 \\n\r\nThe setting brings up plot holes, which involves some spoilers, so I'll keep em to myself. Though Boku no Hero is another \"Super hero high school\" thing, it wasn't half bad and quite interesting from time to time. \\n\r\non the other hand, the setting did not get nearly enough of an explanation. And I get it, it's a 12 episode show, so some credit needs to be given. But that doesn't cover the fact that the explanation for the existence of superpowers was lazy as hell. The excuse that some people just randomly had them at birth shows lazy writing.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 6/10 \\n\r\nOff to a rough start, but got better as it went along. The anime tried to tell two different stories, neither were bad, but also not that great. The plot arc is defined, but it didn't really have that much of a climax, as there was no main antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Thoughts/Enjoyment: 7/10 \\n\r\nI'm not normally a fan of these \"Super Hero High school\" stories, but the unique side characters that are introduced in the show proved to be my biggest enticement to continue watching.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetics (VA+Art): 6/10\\n\r\nThe show had a somewhat unique art style, mimicking North American comics. However, the voice acting never shined bright, and remained pretty average throughout. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nMy Hero Academia",

            "content": "A mildly entertaining watch, but nothing more than that. Boku no Hero Academia is a type of series that isn\u2019t anything beyond just one more fighting anime and one that follows common aspects of the genre as if they were rules. There is an ambitious protagonist with a dream, his mentor and a strange world where people have peculiar abilities/powers. Even though more series fit that description, what makes them different is what they add to the formula and not how well they follow it. In Boku no Hero Academia, there are few of those extra features and the one different aspect it has -the setting - is made unimportant as the series progresses. \\n\\n\r\nIn the world of Boku no Hero Academia, 80% of all people have some special kind of ability. It became so common, in fact, that the 20% remaining are now the unusual ones and unfortunately the protagonist is among them. What sets this setting apart from others is how the protagonist has no prospect of growth. The power he wants to become a hero (like so many people in this world now are) is not something he can train on his own to obtain. He was simply not born with it, and there is, at first, nothing he can do about it. This aspect alone goes against most of the shounen of the same kind: while the message is usually that one only needs to work hard to achieve their goals, the frustration of someone with an innate difference is not so common of a theme. In a strange way everything seems to be a big deceit when the protagonist acquires a special power anyway, meaning that what was apparently established in the first episodes is not what the anime meant to explore at all. In the end it seems that the show reinforces the idea that the only way to success is to be like everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nFor the time being, though, the protagonist finda a way to achieve his dream. Because he has a starting point -- a power -- he can go to the same school the hero he admires went to. Since the protagonist obtained his power a short while before the entrance exams and taking into account the training he had before them, it all seemed to be leading to this point. Getting into this \u201cacademy\u201d comes off as a necessity for the story to introduce shounen conventions and not for the growth of the protagonist. Even though the academy is an important point in the story (it is in the title itself, after all), the way the protagonist gets there shows that the will of the story shapes the will of the characters and not the other way around. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, if we leave the characters to the side for now, this part of the series is not all that bad. If you like battle shounens, then you will (probably) like the battle shounen aspects of Boku no Hero Academia. There is the typical test characters need to pass and the training they have to go through after they pass that test. The test is interesting because it is the first time we get to see how the protagonist uses his power and likewise the training shows how the protagonist will handle its use once he comprehends its limitations. The fights that follow are often creative when it comes to the protagonist\u2019s tactics, although all the other characters seem to only rely on the strength of their powers to win. The fights are one of the things the Boku no Hero Academia did well and they are what accounts for most of the anime\u2019s enjoyment factor. The downside to them is that because of characters that only follow stereotypes or strange relationships between those characters (for example, the protagonist admiring a guy that ceaselessly bullies him) the fights are much less intense because there is no real, personal conflicts when they do happen. When characterization and setting fail, everything is left to the action and the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the story is when it is rendered meaningless, not only because of bad characterization, but mainly because the show demonstrates inconsistencies from the very beginning, as was the case with the story\u2019s setting. Although this is only one side of the anime, inconsistencies negatively affect any show. If the viewer cannot count on the anime to be well-structured, there is no room to analyze anything beyond maybe an action sequence looking nice. It is not clear what Boku no Hero Academia is trying to do and any guess is futile since the dots that should be connected keep moving around. The outcome of any situation becomes irrelevant and the enjoyment is left to the most superficial parts of the show to carry, such as action sequences. But in the end, if  you like this type of show and are simply looking for enjoyment, not minding if it does not go too much beyond that, then Boku no Hero Academia is a good one to watch.",

The very obvious take on American super heroes drawn to a more eastern style was quite interesting for me. I found myself genuinely intrigued by what new powers each new character would bring, but that enthusiasm died as fast as the new character's relevance. I felt like a lot of the characters had a good amount of potential, but were just used as shells to showcase new and cool powers, which don't get me wrong, I did enjoy, but I would preferto have a few well developed characters over a vast amount of shallow ones. If you are looking for a show with epic heroes doing heroic things, a rock'n opening theme, and overall awesome fighting scenes, this is definitely your cup of tea. However, if you are looking for something revolutionary, be it a new take on the action genre, incredibly well choreographed fighting scenes, or anything that pushes the limit, you most likely will not have your expectations met.",

I can do everything,just leave it to me!\r\nStory(7/10)\r\nAll things considered,the story is average at this point because it's mostly an introduction to the real core of the plot.In a world full of people with ''Quriks'' and of heroes and villains,Izuku dreams to become someone like All Might,the symbol of peace.The problem is,he doesn't have any powers,just his intel on the heroes.One day when he tries to save hischildhood ''friend'' Katsuki(who always made fun of Izuku's powerlessness) he meets All Might.The hero thought too that Izuku didn't have any chance at his dream but after seeing his courage he atmits to it being possible.And so All Might reveals his real form and power and transfers to Izuku his power and hope.From there on it's pretty much training and the arrival of some uninvited guests and some cool fights.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9/10)\\n\\n\r\nI'm not so picky about things like animation and sound but I gotta say the characters' design looked quite unusual.The fight scenes looked pleasing along with all of the colorfulness.\\n\\n\r\nSound(8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending,while not being usually of my taste were surprisingly catchy and I found myself humming the songs several times.None of my favorite voice actors were in this but I liked the principal's voice,it sounded like Russia(Hetalia).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI liked most of the characters,they had all kinds of unique abilities.Izuku and All Might are the ones who I liked it most  because of their will to do everything in their power to assure the safety of their dear ones and the courage they show in the most dire times.I have to say that I disliked Kacchan because of his lack of care and egocentric tendencies.Yes,I get that he grew up thinking his Quirk was the best but he has to realise the world doesn't revolve around him.I just hope doesn't go to the dark side like Sasuke.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(8/10)\\n\\n\r\nShocking to me,I enjoyed this quite a lot except the fact that it all ended too quickly without getting to know all its Quirks.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(8/10)\\n\\n\r\nIt's good,yes,I would recommend it to anyone who likes super heroes and shounen anime\\n",

Now I have seen a lot of superhero animations, but this one is one of a kind, for it does not just show off the superpowers of the hero, it inspires us than anyone can be one if you have the heart for it.\r\nThe way the plot of this anime is presented is so perfect that you don't see any flaws. No one's OP, everyone has a weakness. Even the powerful Allmight has a weakness. But that doesn't stop him from being the symbol of peace. From this, we can understand whythe MC, Midoriya, admires him so much. Being able to keep on fighting even if all odds are against you is something we can be proud of. That is the very message of this anime, one which Midoriya learned as he makes himself a hero.\\n\\n\r\nThe expressions portrayed by the characters are those we can definitely feel. Perhaps it is because we have all been in that same situation: being pushed down, being told that you can't be what you want to be. But it is through this ordeal that we must stand up and prove them wrong. Even if we weren't born with the talent, we just have to strive to make ourselves be better versions of ourselves in order for us to reach our dreams.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound further expressed the mood and atmosphere of each scene. By combining these elements do we feel the emotions displayed on screen. Truly, it is a beautiful anime with a beautiful message.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this to everyone, especially those who have fallen in the dark shades of reality. It's never too late to stand up, never too late to reach your dreams. This is YOUR hero academia.",

            "content": "I usually avoid any type of shonen anime because frankly, you've seen one you've seen them all. That's probably why I avoided BNHA (anime and manga) for so long. When it came out though, I still vividly remember the hype surrounding it and how it was that one anime of the season that everyone talked about. \r\nNow here we are a good two years later and I've decided to watch BNHA because of a 7 hour flight I had. I needed something to do so what better more than to binge an entire anime series (Spoiler: I didn't finish it in one sitting on theplane). There's something about BNHA though where everything just works? And I'll explain what I mean (Spoiler alerts I guess) \\n\\n\r\nStory: The story's nothing different. An underdog in a world full of people greater than him. Deku wants to be what he can't, until he's given the chance to be what he's always wanted to be. From that point, its him adjusting to school life as a new quirk holder. Its nothing we haven't seen before with other anime, but for some reason, I was really into it. Towards the ending of the first season is where the underlying plot starts to come out and still, its nothing we haven't seen before. But still, for something like BNHA, it works. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art's solid. Its studio Bones, nothing more to it. (If you need some reminding, they did FMAB, Ouran, FMA, Soul Eater, etc) Its colorful and fluid and over the top and that's exactly what something like this anime needs. Each character has their own look and their own costume that says who they are and you can tell a lot of creativity and time went into each of these character's looks.  Its pretty much everything you could want and expect from a shonen anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I bought the sub by accident on Itunes. As I'm catching up to the third season, I can't find myself switching to the dub anytime soon (Yes, I'm aware it won awards for the dub, but the sub just works better for me). Each character's voice fits and there's no awkward sounding characters anywhere. Its obvious they took their time picking voice actors as well. The music is alright? I can't find myself skipping the opening but other than that nothing else really stands out. (There's a rap song somewhere in there though that made me do a double take). Overall, the sound is solid as well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Its an ensemble anime, so that means there's going to be lots and lots of characters. Somehow (to me at least), it works very well with the characters in the first season. Deku, All Might, and Bakugo especially. It starts to introduce who everyone is towards the end and all at the same time, so its a little hard to remember who everyone is and what they do though. I wish they had done it more spaced out or a little earlier even. Its the first season, so I really hope nobody expects major character development and character motives so soon (and if so that's not really fair?) For the first season however, you get enough of each character (and a full detail speech of their quirks) to not question them any more than what you have. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. I was prepared for overpowered characters and power of friendship speeches and defying odds but really, BNHA doesn't do that. It takes whatever kind of logic it can create in this world and explains it. As for our main protagonist Izuku, I was very pleasantly surprised that even though he was the face of the anime, he had to work for what he got. He had to prove that yes, he was deserving of the One for All quirk and it was given to him, he didn't know how to automatically use it. Even though he trained and trained to be able to even hold the ability in his body, he has to train and train some more to be able to use it (which he still isn't able to fully at the end of the first season). Its nice to see him lose and not defy odds and having to rely on other people because he knows he can't do this by himself. What better person to mentor him than his childhood hero? \\n\\n\r\nBNHA is nothing special or spectacular, but at the same time it is. It knows what it is and what it wants to be and it makes watching it over the top and fun. You want Deku, as well as the entire UA Academy and even the Pro Heroes they meet to succeed. I regret not watching this as it was coming out because it truly lived up to the hype it got.\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend BNHA? Absolutely. The only thing preventing me to a solid 10 is the full endgame of the story as a whole.",

            "content": "My Hero Academia is an anime written by Kouhei Horikoshi who draws inspiration from many American superhero comics. Nothing wrong if this anime is getting a lot of great appreciation out there even the series that I can say \"overrated\" into something very popular for anyone watching an anime or not. I just watched the 2nd season even though it was a bit late to resolve. The Crunchyroll Award last year also put a lot of hope from the second season series that also made me a bit disappointed and angry with them. But, this is a cliche thing that I want to enjoy too.It's not my typical shounen anime or anything else but I just want to enjoy an anime with full of action in it. Because indeed, men like that thing although sometimes I think is pretty childish. This spring also has the third season that starts running now while I also don't want to follow it first. If it's all out, I'm going to spit it out. The first season I've also watched this during a long time. So, it's weird if I want to review the second season and the first season when I've been watching for a long time. But, let me try it that I hope I still remember it.\\n\\n\r\nMy Hero Academia doesn't impress a heavy storytelling because it's back again from its own anime. The story is simple and the main point of this anime is a superpower and superhero. With both of these things creates \"quirks,\" a term of the power from each of these superheroes. There is no obvious reason that the protagonist and antagonist here because of the tide's always back and forth. Izuku Midoriya is a protagonist who has no \"quirks\" at all in the beginning. He is often bullied by his childhood friend Katsuki Bakugou who makes this character a memorable antagonist, at the beginning. I said at the beginning because the development of this character will eventually peak when he was defeated by the protagonist. Making himself learn from his past, the characters still remain the same. But, one of the focusings of this anime has lies is in \"All Might.\" He is a superhero who inspires many people, including Midoriya and Bakugou. But, if you didn't understand what I'm saying right now, let me summarize this. It has a childish theme, bad jokes, predictable, upside down storytelling and many more. So, I came back again because it was as impressive as the cartoons of children in general. So, this is disappointed me in good ways.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to know what My Hero Academia has it all, the art is somewhat mediocre. Studio Bones is known for the very popular anime, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood that produces the best artwork and animation from this studio. Though I was just as exaggerated, I admitted it was. My Hero Academia feels like a superhero comic that moves by itself. There is no obvious reason for that but, people consider for a good thing. Although like that, I'm a little fond of the artwork that presented in this anime because is memorable colorful and remembers, this is a superhero thing. The costumes that designed also impressed in such a way as to read Marvel or DC comics.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is more I like best from any other aspect. Porno Graffiti perform the song's \"The Day\" with a vigorous music as if portraying a superhero in general. With his lyrics inviting adrenaline superheroes, they play this song with a fast tempo so it's not wrong if this song is one of the overrated songs at the time. The song is also enhanced with its visuals and mood that fits perfectly with everything. I don't really remember that \"Heroes\" by Brian the Sun is not very memorable for me. In fact, I forgot how the song sounded. This ending theme song is also pretty good, if I hear it again. Daiki Yamashita who fills Izuku Midoriya can be spelled out even though this is one of the most underrated seiyuu. Some I know only Yowamushi Pedal before this anime comes out. Nobuhiko Okamoto is the badass in this anime that fills Katsuki Bakugou. His character changed rapidly when previously filling out Karma Akabane from Assassination Classroom. Kenta Miyake, Ayane Sakura, Kaito Ishikawa, and friends I said well. But, Kaji Yuki is cool in this. In the second season too, he took part in filling Shouto Todoroki. The composer, Yuuki Hayashi, has a good score like the superhero thing in general.\\n\\n\r\nSo, this what makes me more disappointed about this. I know that the first season just gets a little ration compared to the second season. But, all of its characters are well lame. I know that there are many different characters in here. But, we don't know who their roles are. For example, Izuku Midoraya which is, supposedly, the protagonist is even further his role is so small. Probably because the author wants to make something like zero to hero, development little by little. But, All Might finally take part at the end of the episode. Katsuki Bakugou who as we know is a bully who's trying to impress like a bad guy. But, he's not an antagonist because he only supports the character of the protagonist. It also makes me feel uncomfortable with this character because his role is often up and down even unclear. Although explain all characters is long, this anime feels like memorable to display a variety of characters but the role of these characters is narrow. Only a few characters that have an important role here while there are some characters are also trying to enter into the supporting figure of the protagonist. By the way, Shouta Aizawa and Shouto Todoroki are my favorite characters in this anime even though their role is also spelled out a bit here.\\n\\n\r\nAfter some of the complaints I've been putting through words, I'm enjoying them all apart from those lacks because coming back again, this is a superhero thing where all men love this very much. It's like an anime that target some teenagers even adults. Children may not be able to get understand when they watch this anime even though it seems predictable, childish, and lame characters, this is the shounen thing. So, this anime I can say is perfect for everyone both for men and women because this is a casual thing.\\n\\n\r\nMy Hero Academia is a casual watching where everyone will love it. If you like an action, you'll love it. If you like a superhero, you'll love it. If you like a superpower, you'll love it too. In essence, this anime can be said suitable for you who still teens even adults who want to enjoy an anime version of Marvel or DC. From zero to hero, a few flaws exist in this anime. Has a lame character, a jumping plot, the role of the characters who are always upside down, and too childish. Although like that, this anime is devoted to teenagers and adults. From the beginning of it, I feel that this anime certainly will have a sequel regardless of the popularity. The second season is even much better though some I feel there is less as well. Although that way, the second season is more towards well-development, while the first season is more to the introduction of heroes and villains. Therefore, next, I will discuss the second season of this series.",

            "content": "This show is good but nothing really stands out to me.  If I had to describe it I guess I would say it feels a lot like one punch man except the main character isn't an all powerful emotionless badass.  The story is okay and can provide some entertainment but there's nothing really great about it.  First few episodes were pretty effective in explaining the kind of world the characters live in as well as what the main character's dreams and obstacles are.  Midoriya Izuku, or Deku as he's called, wants to become a hero even though he was born withno powers, or Quirk. In an amazing stroke of luck he meets his idol All Might, who is the greatest hero of all time.  All Might eventually decides to mentor Deku and gives him his very own Quirk.  This allows Deku to enroll in the greatest hero school of all time.  After he's allowed to attend the school of his dreams, the story kind of slows down.  I don't feel like anything is really at stake or anyone is going to die.  Even when we're specifically told that something terrible is going to happen I don't feel any real threat.  I wasn't even worried when the class had to take on a swarm of villains because I knew All Might and the rest of the heroes would show up to save the day.  By the end of the season I wasn't really interested in what new adventures the characters would eventually go through because I felt like everything would just turn out ok.  \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, most of them aren't even really that important or memorable. Midoriya, All Might, and Bakugo are pretty much the only ones who are given any sort of back story, personality, and goal.  Midoriya is a shy and weak boy with a good heart.  All Might is a great hero whose time is running short.  Bakugo is Deku's rival/bully/childhood friend who was constantly being praised about how great he was but hates Deku because he feels like Deku doesn't believe in what a god he is.  I'm really not sure if they want us to pity Bakugo or just straight out hate him because there are times where he is shown to be a complete asshole maniac who even tried to kill Deku at one point, and times where they show him to just be this misunderstood kid who still has a lot to learn and won't quit until everyone acknowledges him.  Everyone else, besides a couple of people, are pretty bland and forgettable.  It basically feels like the show wants us to identify most of the characters by their powers instead of who they are.  Hell, I still don't know the names of the majority of the class I just classify them by their abilities.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is good and the animation can do some pretty impressive things during fight scenes which is always entertaining to see.\\n\\n\r\nI like the music for the most part.  Opening theme is good and the closing sounds great.  Perhaps the one bit of music I'm not very fond of is All Might's theme whenever he shows up because it sounds way to cheerful.\\n\\n\r\nI may have named a lot of flaws but I definitely am interested in seeing where this show goes next season.  The quirks are interesting and the story does hint that some serious shit is in the works.  The first season may not have gripped me into the story as much as it should have but I can't really blame it since it was only 13 episodes.  Given a little time and effort I do think the next season can be something great.",

            "content": "I remember when season one of Boku No Hero Academia first came out I didn't think anything of it. Everyone was talking about how great it was but I just didn't have the time to watch it between school and the anime's I was already watching.\r\nBut when Season 2 came out and it was receiving more attention than Attack On Titan Season 2 (Which I still think is absolutely amazing) I decided maybe it was time to finally check out this amazing anime I've heard so much great stuff about. God do I wish I watched this anime sooner. Season 1 was just soooooo good,I started watching it late at night around 3AM, I ended almost watching every episode before I decided I had to sleep before I died.\\n\\n\r\nEverything about Season 1 was just amazing, The clean art style, the unique enjoyable plot and the opening, god do I love the opening. I'm not kidding when I say as i'm writing this review I have it looped.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly love every single character in this anime, from All Might to Midoriya, Bakugo to best girl Ochako they were all amazing and lovable. Unlike your typical given everything for free main hero, Midoriya is just a normal person until he meets All Might. All Might forces him to work extremely hard in order to reach his goal of becoming the greatest hero. This makes for such a lovable character as you get to see all the struggles he goes through to reach his goal in life, just like an actual human he has to work to reach his goal in life and goes through tons of hardships just to achieve it.\\n\\n\r\nThe fight scenes in this anime are so clean, honestly I still believe Attack on Titan wins in terms of fight scenes but this is sure a close second. Every punch just flows so well. It may not be anything special but the fight scenes in this anime have a certain appeal to them, they don't focus to hardcore on fight scenes like Attack on Titan but they sure as hell make them enjoyable and everything just seems to move so smoothly.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is just perfect, everything about it is so goddamn enjoyable. I've already re watched the first season 3 times waiting for those glorious Saturdays when I can get my hands on a new episode of season 2. I most definitely recommend this anime, it's honestly one the best on-going anime's right now.",

Not that interesting but fine.\r\nArt:10/10\r\nThe art is amazing. Lemme tell you the fight scenes are the best. Super cool and spectacular.

The creator of Naruto even promoted the series and said it was the real deal. It takes a profound and unique spin on the genre and has solid characters, an intriguing story and a fantastic soundtrack. Studio Bones is doing an excellent job with the adaptation as well. As a manga reader I'm very much looking forward to the future of this series. \r\nUnique, complex, dark and optimistic\r\nMy Hero Academia is in many ways different from previous Naruto! while still the same withstory. Deku is an interesting character especially for a Shonen! protagonist. The show tries it's best to surprise the viewers and I believe it truly succeeds in the first viewing and the rewatches. My Hero Academia gives the message that go beyond and plus ultrea and Hate will never truly be the answer and does it best to prove that communication and kindness are the way to succeed. If you're put off by the visuals, watch till episode 8 and see if you get hook. I started watching this around the near end of summer 2017 and loved it at first sight. As you know, I don't normally watch any anime after It's bean a year since it came to an end.\\n\\n\r\nIt does have good characters like Bakugou, Tokoyami Fumikage and All Might.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is by Yuuki Hayashi (Gundam Build Fighters, Haikyuu!, Diabolik Lo-Death Parade), and is certainly a very heroic piece. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:I found My Hero Academia to be a worthy usage of time, and I give it a 10 out of 10 since we know that a second season is right around the corner, and will recommend that you buy this series. \\n\\n\r\nOne word. PERFECT\\n\\n",

            "content": "Comics+Anime=All of my yes!\r\nI'm not just an anime fan, I also love superheroes. The Capes, the Colorful (and sometimes not so colorful) costumes, the sometimes nonsensical even when they're trying to be serious plotlines, the dumb no kill rules, I love it all. And as a DC fan who was massively disappointed by Batman V Superman all I can say is that this series helped get the taste of that failure out of my mouth. Let's dive into the story before this becomes a Batman V Superman rant.\r\nStory: Welcome to a world where 80% of the population have special abilities called quirks. These can beanything from fire manipulation to being able to grow as large as a building. But not everyone wants to use their powers for good. So what do you do? You make Superhero-ing (I know that's not a word) a legitimate business. Enter Midoriya, a quirkless kid who wants to become a hero in order to follow in the footsteps of his idol All Might. All Might is the greatest hero ever and is a self appointed \"Symbol of Peace\". However Midoriya's dreams get shot down at every turn, his classmates laugh at him and even his mother doesn't really give him any encouragement. That is until one day Midoriya runs into All Might. Even All Might tells Midoriya to give up on being a hero at first, until he witnesses Midoriya running head first into a battle showcasing that he has a heart of a hero. All Might then decides to train Midoriya so he can get accepted into the most prestigious Hero school.\\n\\n\r\nJoining Midoriya on his quest to become the greatest hero ever are: \\n\\n\r\nAll Might: The symbol of peace is a great guy. He's basically Superman, even his theme sounds suspiciously similar to the Donner Superman theme. He's a great guy who's always smiling to inspire hope in others, even when he himself is in a terrible situation.\\n\\n\r\nOchaco Uraraka: A nice girl and one of Midoriya's class mates, she has the ability to make things float.\\n\\n\r\nTenya lida: Another one of Midoriya's classmates, he's all about rules and such. He's the flash, he can run fast.\\n\\n\r\nKatsuki Bakugo: This guy's an asshole. He was Midoriya's friend (Sort of...he was still an asshole when he was a kid) in the past but their friendship slowly deteriorated as time went on. Now Bakugo just bullies Midioriya for fun. He has the ability to form explosions in his palms.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation is fantastic...not much more to say. It's Bones, it'd be weird if I said anything else.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also fantastic. The three standouts being \"The Day\" by Porno Graffiti (Don't laugh!), \"You say run\", and \"Hero A\". \\n\\n\r\nThe show isn't the most original but it does a fine job with what it has, though I will admit that the first three episodes are slow. After that though the show is a ride on the hype train all the way through, especially the last three episodes. The characters (outside of Midoriya and All Might) aren't the most fleshed out by this point either but you have to remember that we're going straight Shonen up in this bitch, so we still have like 100 more episodes to flesh these guys out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a great series that doesn't exactly do anything new but makes what it has work.",

            "content": "Well I decided to write a review for this one because it actually exceeded my expectations which is hard especially since I went in being very skeptical of the all to typical shounen. I even put it off till episode seven came out because of my skepticism.\r\nStory-7\r\nAs everyone knows shounens are usually never to original in fact most follow a similar formula. However Boku no Hero Academia reminded me that its not a complex story that gives shounen its appeal but the feelings it inspires in you. Like some of you, I grew up with DragonballZ and Naruto, both of which arent master pieces butthe reason I loved them growing up and cherish them now is they motivated me, gave me feelings of aspiration and courage. Not trying to be sentimental but as you watch Hero Academia youll be reminded of the feelings you had the first time Goku turned into a supersayin, when Naruto defeats Pain, Ichigo faces off with Byakuya to save Rukia and so on. The story is very simple, with very simple explanations. Its set in a world were super powers are common place and heroes are a recognized occupation. Our protagonist is the familiar timid and humble character who longs to become one of those heroes yet has no power. The show is about his path to reaching his goal. And thats it no hidden messages, no cool metaphors or symbolism just a story about heroes and the making of them. Now dont get me wrong, personally my favorite genres include seinen and my all time favorite anime is the original Ghost in the Shell but like I said this is just a great example of light hearted fun with inspiring characters. \\n\\n\r\nArt-7\\n\r\nThe art in Boku no Hero Academia isnt incredible but it isnt bad either. Like its story its simple and does the job perfectly. The fight scenes are done well enough and the colors are bright, flashy and over-the-top when it needs it to be. \\n\\n\r\nSound/Music-10\\n\r\nThis is were I believe the anime excels the most. Its a great example of what music can do for a show. It fits perfectly with the hero theme and those uplifting moments. Its no exaggeration when I say that half of what made the show great was the music. Best accompanying anime music that season in my opinion. The OP and ED where OK but the music during the show was much more impressive. Voice actors did a great job (japanese anyway), especially All-Mights. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters-9\\n\r\nThe characters in Boku no Hero Academia are kinda cut and pace from other series but somehow it does well with what its given and your able to still laugh along those same familiar moments, feel sad, motivated, excited etc despite seeing these same performances done by other characters before. In fact even though your aware of this from the beginning you may forget about it as the show progresses.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\r\nLike Ive mentioned before the show does a really great job making you feel inspired and thats what a shounen is for. Its for \"boys\" (and girls) growing up who need that motivation to do their best in whatever they do. Even though I am in college now when I watched it, it gave me the same feelings I would have have if I were 14 and watching. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\r\nDont overlook it, I know its rare to find a shounen that can stand out among its many, many predecessors but Hero Academia is one of those and if you have ever enjoyed some of the classic shows that aired on Toonami when you were a kid then you may just enjoy this.",

            "content": "Boku No Hero Academia Season 1: It's a season 1\r\nThe premise of My Hero Academia is really good as it takes on a pseudo-racial premise based around the show's idea of Quirks, and runs with it, using the main character to convey a very shonen theme of \"If you work hard enough and you show that you have the FIGHTING SPIRIT to be a hero, then sky's the limit, and you can be the best hero out there.\"  Characters are likable, if not one-dimensional (excluding our main character), the soundtrack is standardly good, and the animation fluid with an art style that is distinctivelywestern, reminiscent of the Marvel and DC western comics.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only problem with this season 1 is that it's so short, and it kinda sorta feels like we got nowhere, unlike other season 1s (Kuroko no Basket comes to mind) where the season alone gives you a sense of how big the show's world is as well as a somewhat conclusive ending that will keep you satisfied until a season 2 comes out.  This show as a season 1 didn't do that for me, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm still excited to see what the rest of the show has to offer.  This is a series that is very much worth following! ^_^\\n\\n\r\n-MSYN",

            "content": "My Hero Academia is an inspiring story about achieving your dreams. It makes me feel invested in the characters and their stories. I cried, I laughed and overall enjoyed this series.\r\nI gave this series a 10 for a reason, even if not everyone agrees with me.\r\nHere is what I thought on each aspect of the show if you are interested.\r\nStory: 8\r\nIn a world where you don't fit in, and fate is against your dreams is tough. Especially when everyone reminds you everywhere you go. As generic as this is, I felt they delivered it right. Over the span of 2 episodes, we see our MCMidoriya go from Zero to Hero. We see characters like Bakugou that are born powerful and we see characters like Midoriya that aren't. It helps us see the difference and how reality can suck. He's not gifted, he doesn't 'magically' get his quirk, he works for it. This sends off a good message and makes me motivated to do things.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have seen shows like 'Black Clover' or 'Naruto', you may say that they are similar in some aspects. If this was a review for those shows, I would rate the same.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole hero idea and everyone having power really appeals to me than just one kid being 'special' and 'one-of-a-kind' with his power among a normal society.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nCan I just start with how much I LOVE this artstyle? Everything looks attractive and appealing to the eye. Especially the characters hero costumes. The facial expressions are very accurate to their personalities AND, the fight scenes are animated fantastically! This one may not appeal to everyone the way it does for me, but I love how everything is designed and drawn by being so smooth.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nYou Say Run. A track played multiple times through the first episode. It is played differently though at different parts to either sound sad or bold. The way the track is played when his mother tells him that he can't be a hero and when Midoriya attempted to saved Bakugou and when All Might told Midoriya he can be a hero really struck me. The same song made me feel different emotions at different times proving that 'You Say Run goes with everything' (Don't quote me on that.)\\n\\n\r\nVarious other tracks really set the mood making the intensity higher, or the moment more depressing. MHA's OST is really a work of art that is highly under appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nI feel invested in each and every character\u2019s story. If it\u2019s a Pro Hero, a Student or a Villain, they all have a story to tell. Each character has a unique personality making them stand out for different reasons and I like that. Of course some characters are not very likeable while others would be considered \u201ccliche\u201d, but that shouldn\u2019t turn you away. Each quirk also makes each character special and I like that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nFrom the fight scenes to when we see Midoriya progress as a hero, I feel invested in the story and what's going on. I leave wondering what will happen next and what the result will be. I feel excitement bubble in my stomach and I feel empathy from the bottom of my heart at almost every scene that is made to make you feel. Of course some parts are a little slow, but the parts that get me going outshine those by a landslide!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nMy Hero Academia is a story that made me invest majority of my thoughts into it in a positive way. I believe that anyone can enjoy this show if they keep an open mind to it. I assure you that if you like superheroes, mystery, action, you will most certainly walk away with at least some kind of happiness after completing this show and it will drag you back in for more in Season 2.",

            "content": "My Hero Academia.\r\nSynopsis: My first thought of the anime was that the story was about a kid who appeared weaker than his peers. I have seen anime in where the weak character remains a weak character, and so I had assumed the worst that this anime would remain unappealing. I really thought, \"oh man, this kid is taking all of this garbage and not fighting about it. I'm not so sure about this anime.\"\r\nTo add onto that, the jokes initially seemed overdone and horrific. I mean, for what reason would I laugh at a kid getting beaten down or insulted. That's complete garbage, but theanime made light of it. What the anime didn't tell me was that this show has potential. What the anime didn't tell me at the time was that the weak can become the strong. That those who strive to be the best and learn from their mistakes can deal some serious justice in this world. It is not always about who starts off great, but who can adapt, and who can become someone that others look up to.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are following me in the previous two paragraphs, you will likely understand that there is a reason to enjoy this anime. There is a reason to enjoy the pursuit to become the best.\\n\\n\r\n__________\\n\r\nNow this is all optimistic thinking. Surely everyone is glad and happy to see a superhero deal out some serious damage to baddies, but what about the folks that aren't super. This anime plays into that effect. This kid who was tormented. This kid that was insulted and shown almost no love was the same kid that did his homework. This same kid realized that to be the best, one had to study the best and that's what he did. In situations in-where he would normally lose, he relied upon his knowledge that he wrote down in books everyday about the heroes that he admired. What would they do? He did it. How would they handle the situation? He handled it.\\n\\n\r\nEven if he felt afraid, he went for it.\\n\\n\r\n___________\\n\r\nWhy this anime may receive negative feedback. Certain characters have omega super powers. Please keep in mind that those powers have self-sacrifice involved and are not unlimited. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character plays the nice guy who wants to save everyone. The main character refuses to show bias towards anyone else, thus making him very likable. Is it fault in the anime to deter the number one character from making emotional mistakes?\\n\\n\r\n___________\\n\r\nIf watching a motivating \"boys becomes hero\" anime tickles your fancy, here is why you should watch it.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 7/10 There is no real purpose for the plot, except it be a 'slice of life' plot line. Yes, sinister scenarios occur and turmoil supersedes the daily lives of heroes, but it's hard to figure out a well defined goal here.\\n\\n\r\nPersonas: 7/10 The main character is more or less explained about and in summary has a 'nice guy' type of personality. There are numerous other characters in this anime, some with more airtime than others, but the timeline gives the viewer ample time to really foreshadow any of the other heroes. I will note that most characters have distinct personalities.\\n\\n\r\nGraphics: 9/10 Modern style art and graphics. Really well done. Goes the extra mile to demonstrate high frame scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 9/10 Incredibly motivating at times. Well placed within the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Actors: 9/10 The Japanese actors had the typical tough guy voices on the strong characters and the lighter voices in smaller characters. Potentially stereotypical, but no complaints here. Much emotion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nRecommended: Well worth it. Season 2 is coming out.",

            "content": "Here is the video \"Review\": Is My Hero Academia Manmode? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WBpGrLxHyw\r\nI put a lot of effort into my videos and sometimes I get a negative response, because I\u2019m shamelessly promoting my shit, but you tell how else am I supposed to get my videos out there. People aren\u2019t going to find them by themselves, because YouTube doesn\u2019t put my videos high when you search for a certain review.\r\nIf anyone prefers reading though, you can do that as well:\r\nKeep in mind, that this was basically my \u201cscript\u201d for the video.\\n\r\nHi I\u2019m Man Mode. Welcome to the first episode of my new show, where I tell you if the series is ManMode, with a simple \u201cye\u201d or \u201cnah\u201d answer. What is man mode you might ask? Man Mode is Guts single handedly (literally) slaying 100 soldiers in one night. It doesn\u2019t always have to be related to male gender, as the name would have you believe, because Man Mode is also Teresa taking on 4 best Claymores and owning them without going all out. Doesn\u2019t always have to be violence either. Arima going up on stage and competing, when he knows he doesn\u2019t stand a chance and can barely play, is also Man Mode. So Man Mode is basically a code for being badass and all around awesome. And if your mama and papa thought you to read, you already know that today\u2019s first episode is: Is My hero academia Man mode?\\n\\n\r\nWhen I was a little boy there was nothing I was more crazy about than heroes (well and robots, but that\u2019s beside the point). All kinds of heroes: marvel, dc, power rangers, even beetle borgs\u2026fucking beetle borgs. I even played heroes in yugioh. But you know I was kinda edgy back then so of course I played the dark and mysterious ones.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, Boku no Hero Academia didn\u2019t disappoint one bit. The story centers around a young kid, named Midorya Izoku. In this world, 80% of the people are born with special powers called quirks. Some are useful, some destructive and some don\u2019t do very much. Midoriya desperately wants to become a hero. He has the heart for it and that was pretty much his biggest dream, since well, forever. But unfortunately he was one of the unlucky bastards born without a quirk and that is what makes him instantly relatable.\\n\\n\r\nBut then, one day he is saved by his childhood hero: All Might. And my god this guy is cool as shit. Now listen to me. If you dislike this guy, which how could anyone ever dislike this fabulous, spandex waring, what the fuck is this hairstyle, smiling gentleman you are basically Hitler. Yep that\u2019s what you are. It isn\u2019t supposed to be funny and doesn\u2019t make much sense, but I hate you and I don\u2019t want you here, or anywhere on my channel. I can honestly safely say all might steals the show every time he is on screen. Everyone is great and all and I really liked the variety of different heroes. But all might is on an entirely different level. You know when I was telling you what is man mode? All might is man mode incarnate.\\n\\n\r\nFirst few episodes of boku no hero deliver a strong emotional punch, as you watch Izoku really struggle. Than the series shifts to a much more shonen action tone, which will keep you highly entertained,. Not as good as the first few episodes, but still pretty good. With moment that make you jump from your seat and scream how awesome that was, and then your hot mother or sister comes in and tells you to get a job. But where the series really came right swinging, was in the last two episodes, when shit goes down and you see all the heroes and villains in action. Episode 12 in particular was one of the most entertaining and hype episodes in recent memory of watching anime.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the series has a lively color pallet and the animation is superb, with most of the animators from one punch man making sure that it\u2019s a visual treat. The soundtrack nicely compliments the anime ascetics and some of the tracks stood out as really good. The opening song in particular I found to be very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nMy only big complaint with the series is that nothing major happens in the span of 13 episodes, as the show focuses more on building its characters, which it does well. I get that this is only the first season and the second season is confirmed, coming our way in the future, but I still have to judge it as its own thing. I just thought it could use more plot. Still not that big of a deal, because I had a lot of fun with the series, but it felt more like a start to a bigger thing and not much was accomplished in the first season, aside from meeting the characters and some really good action sequences.\\n\\n\r\nLike I already said, what it does, it does well. So is buku no Pico academia man mode? Get it because boku no hero, boku no pico? (facepalm)\\n\r\nIs my hero academia man mode?\\n\r\nYES",

            "content": "One of the more recent and popular Shounen JUMP titles, My Hero Academia comes to life in its well-deserved anime adaptation.\r\nAs said within the show itself, the story feels like something out of a comic book. While that's true, that mainly pertains to the very beginning, or in this case the first few episodes. Though, I can't say it's similar to other stories, because the show has a unique twist with how superpowers, or \"Quirks\" as they're called, work and put into practice. I should point out that the anime doesn't cover a whole lot from the original manga. Even if a second season hasbeen confirmed, I will admit how this season played out felt like there should have been more, like it could have had a second cour to it.\\n\\n\r\nIn this universe, 80% of the world's population have these different abilities. No doubt, we're going to see some \"quirky\" characters (I had to...) somewhere along the way. From the elite heroes to the students in training, we get an abundance of fantastic individuals that give the series its charm.\\n\\n\r\nThis season, I've seen wonderful cases of clean and consistent animation. My Hero Academia is no exception. Done by the ever popular studio Bones, they truly give the characters color and show great detail in the action sequences. It's almost as if it were an actual comic book come to life.\\n\\n\r\nI began reading the manga not long before the anime's premiere, and eventually caught up by the last few episodes. Despite what I said about how much was adapted, I still feel that it was well done. It makes me look forward to the next season, which I wasn't expecting to be announced so soon. If you've got what it takes to be a hero, then check out My Hero Academia!",

            "content": "Boku no Hero Academia is a good choice for you if youd enjoy a series that tackles heroism and the traits a person should have in order to be an admirable hero. However it's a bad choice if you're tired a lot of the generic aspects of anime that are set in a school setting with a team of kids that train to become heroes and save the world for onesidedly evil characters. It's also a bad choice if you're tired of the bland shy bullied but selfless main character, who behaves like most average shounen protagonists, who start off as weak or incompetent, andsteadily but surely grow strong as the series moves forward.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is something that was done a lot, or rather, the \"kid wants to become the best at x but he's not good at it\" aspect. Deku wants to become a superhero in a society where 80% of people have superpowers and he doesn't have any. But the manner through which the story executes its narrative and the character arcs of Deku are just well written, and despite using everything that is to be expected in this type of story, it's done in a way that presents most aspects in a really strong way. ..................\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, Deku is indeed the \"IF I TRY HARD ENOUGH, I CAN DO IT!\" character, he's got that attitude. However, the story starts from the point where Deku almost gives up on that view of himself, portraying a chain of events where he has to wake up to reailty. But even when he accepts it, he finds that when someone was in danger, he couldn't just sit around and he had to try to do something to help. And he doesn't generically get powers out of nowhere in this scenario, like some might expect. He is seen as a hindrance and pretty much suicidal for doing something like this. But this whole scenario and everything that led up to it show what type of person he is. He is someone who couldn't become what he aspired because he simply was unlucky, that dreamt of it all along, and was shown the reality of it. And then this course of action leads us as to why he wanted to become what he became. It's because he wanted to make a difference, to help the people who needed help in those dire moments, as he admired people capable of doing so. And as a last attempt at denial, at denying the reality he's in, he tried to do what the people he admired thought they'd do, and tried to help and put himself in harm's way. From a psychological perspective, not a selfless act, but from a bystander's, it is definitely one.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I'm saying by describing the character arc Deku went through is that the series has good character portrayal, and knows how to flesh out its characters. I could explain why the character arc of Deku is even better written than I've already given it credit for, but I'd rather not give away more things about the series than I did unless essential to my point. Anyway, after this short character arc, we fully understand Deku's goal and ambitions, because he was strongly portrayed.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, while the series does have strong character portrayal, I can say that in this season at least, it had strong character portrayal for only 3 characters, those being the main character and two other characters strongly tied to his development. One character is the mentor (of course the shounen protagonist needed a mentor) who is a genuinely good rolemodel, who despite all odds, people have taken a liking to because of how good he was at his job, but he secretly was injured and he is now struggling to keep up everyone else's expectation. He acts out as a symbol of peace and his mere existence keeps people from going nuts and causing chaos around the world. And the other character is his rival (of course the shounen protagonist has a rival) who is a character that is the complete opposite of the protagonist. He's an angsty teen with a superiority complex that wants to become a hero to prove he is the best and that he can always win, who bullies the protagonist because he feels like he challenges his superiority. What Iparticularily enjoy of him is how threatened he feels just by Deku's existence, to the point where I'd even say it even seems like he's almost scared of Deku. What's interesting about this is that the person who's got the most inflated ego, to the point he thinks the world revolves around him, is scared of the person he sees as the lowest of the low, to the point where he can't help but react impulsively whenever Deku doesn't fit the narrative he has had given him. These three portrayals are strong and do wonders for the story.\\n\\n\r\nHowever every other character is just... there, and otherwise, Deku is a generic shounen protagonist. He's a kid who wants to be the best, who's incredibly determined to do so, is an underdog, he's shy around girls because they're girls and other such tropes would also fit him well. The villains are the worst part since they were portrayed as... I wouldn't say cartoonish evil, but as people who simply do petty crimes or just want chaos because HAHAHA, EVERYONE IS A BUNCH OF SISSIES AND SINCE WE HAVE POWERS WE SHOULD ABUSE THEM! Other students don't really have anything yet given to them except everything they need at the surface level to work as characters, some powers and some personality traits. There's plenty of time to flesh them out, but how one dimensional the villains felt, and how much worse they made the last arc kinda worries me.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, while I think for the most part Boku no Hero Academia had a good story, I think the final arc of this season was what most people are genuinely worried with about this show. I won't give any details that are specific to give anything away, but the last arc merely repeated some of the same points the series has already expressed and featured some onedimensional villains. And the whole arc's point was just to say \"this job is dangerous and now the kids know it. there is evil in this world.\" But the \"evil\" is almost saturday morning cartoon-ish in motivation and the only way the job would prove dangerous is there would be permanent consequences to the character's health or existence, such as death, loss of power or a crippling injury. Which I can't say whether or not happens, because not even I know for sure since it's not a point of focus, it's only a possibility. The arc didn't really try to even capitalize on its own message, it merely just wanted to bring all the characters from one point to the next with as minimal consequences as possible.\\n\\n\r\nAt best, I think it was an excuse to have a lot of action, since it had a lot of people in a lot of fights in a secluded area, except there's a lot of jobbers involved with a lot of people with superpowers just eating ass and easily losing, making them feel incompetent and making the confrontations onesided. Which is a somewhat worrysome area in Boku no Hero Academia, since the power gap kinda makes this a constant possibility, where D-Listing could constantly happen and fights feeling onesided. Which doesn't always happen in the series, it does have some good action bits that are entertaining and hype to see, with the best being a 2 on 2 exercise where the characters have to capture a location from the opposing team, where it featured some strategical thinking and tactics. But there's a lot of the bits that feel onesided, where, I get it, some of it has to be there, but you can tell me around 100-200 people with superpowers are just gonna be cannon foddering jobbers in an organized attack.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of comedy, Boku no Hero Academia, didn't really humor me because I don't see a lot of comedy in it. I see the attempts of making some characters perverted or shy around women because they're attractive but really... that's comedy? While the world is nonsensical, I found a lot of the things that are supposed to be aiming this to be considered a comedy to just be tools to make the series lighthearted due to how serious it takes portraying its theme. In all honesty, I don't think there's anything really comedic about this show. I find it to be a really serious show, that tries to be as lighthearted as possible, this sometimes being in conflict with its themes. And I wouldn't call a show a comedy just because it's lighthearted. I'm just addressing this since MAL tagged it as such.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I may have complained about the show's action in terms due to the power gap, the animation is smooth and everything looks good. The artstyle is fairly simplistic and colorful, but nonetheless looks vibrant, fitting the show's aimed energetic nature to pull in the right atmosphere. The soundtrack of the show is mostly atmospheric, with mostly orchestral music and some electronic music influences. It sounds good for the most part, but it isn't exactly my cup of tea, but it serves its purpose.\\n\\n\r\nThat's pretty much what Boku no Hero Academia is. A shounen about heroism. It doesn't really try to distance itself from the same archetypes a shounen has, and that might turn off some people, but it does a genuinely good job in what it portrays. If you're not interested in shounens and detest their tropes, steer clear of this anime. However if you do enjoy them, Boku no Hero Academia is a good shounen. I'd say its execution is definitely good for its target audience, and it's definitely above the average shounen, but it still has the shortcomings that come with it, and not a lot of things to differentiate it from the others, despite its overall strong writing. I enjoyed watching it, because I typically enjoy action shows that stick to their point, and Boku no Hero Academia did do that. I think people who enjoy shounens and well executed themes can enjoy this show, but if the flaws presented are a particular hurdle to you, they are definitely gonna be a detriment to your watching experience",

            "content": "Tl;dr\r\nPros:\r\n1. The anime is a fantastic blend of western superheroes and eastern shonen elements.\r\n2. The many different characters are well-established.\r\n3. The fights are all very entertaining to watch.\r\n4. \r\n5. The OP fits this anime like a glove.\r\nCons:\r\n1. The same flashback scenes are overused and breaks some of the pacing of the story.\r\nBoku no Hero Academia was created with Western superheroes in mind, and it shows. All Might is the most prominent example, but the other heroes in BnHA also adopt English hero names and some of their costumes and designs wouldn't be out of place in a Western superhero cartoon (e.g. Mt. Lady). However, BnHAalso has the conventional shonen elements in place, such as the usual theme of improving oneself in the face of adversity to become a noble hero who wants to save the world. What makes BnHA even more exceptional is how these eastern and western elements work together well instead of clashing. BnHA is equal parts anime and superhero cartoon, similar to previous western entries such as the original Teen Titans which had anime elements incorporated into the cartoon. This fusion of east and west makes BnHA a rather unique anime to watch, bringing out the best of both worlds to create an anime that is very inspiring and entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nBnHA also features quite a large cast, but it makes an effort to make each of them unique and fleshed out. The designs vary wildly between characters, from standard anime human designs to humanoids with animal parts to animals in suits. Each of them has a quirk to go with that befitting of their personalities. Bakugo uses explosions and has a very short temper. Tsuyu is part frog and looks, acts and talks like one (credits to her seiyuu on that last point!), making her one of the most unique supporting characters in BnHA. In fact, all of the seiyuu did a good job voicing the characters overall. The combination of design, personality and quirk works well for each character which makes them easy to remember, understand and root for.\\n\\n\r\nA number of fights occur in BnHA, from hero training to the big one in USJ. With everyone having different quirks and broken off into different teams each time, viewers are treated to the creative ways Class 1A uses their quirks to outsmart their opponents and to synergise with their team members. Each fight is fresh and leaves viewers eager to see what else Class 1A can accomplish with their quirks. This also applies to the pro heroes to a smaller extent, who mostly show up as supporting characters throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the OP is perfect for BnHA. The moment it showed up on episode 1 just blew me away and sent chills down my spine. It gives off a feeling of heroism and inspiration that fits the premise of BnHA so well. I look forward to listening to the OP every episode. Even with the BGM and ED being far less memorable, the OP makes me fall in love with BnHA and I think that's a good enough reason alongside the excellent voice acting to give a 9 for the sound aspect.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, one major issue I have with the anime is that the flashbacks to Izuku and Bakugo's shared history are repeated way too many times. The flashbacks are used to establish the enmity Bakugo feels towards Izuku, then constantly reused (in the hero training part especially) to reinforce that feeling. However, doing so in a bid to build tension only accomplished the opposite as the viewers would get more annoyed by the repeated scenes. It also broke the pacing of the hero training section, dragging it out for far longer than needs be.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, BnHA is a fresh yet conventional take on the shonen genre, and a very well done one at that. Aside from the repeated flashbacks to drag things out, it does a lot of things right and is definitely worth a watch.",

I haven't cried from an anime in a very long time, and I was not expecting to cry during this one.\r\nWARNING *Slight spoilers ahead*\r\nStory 10/10\r\nThe story starts in a society where 80% of the population have quirks (super powers). Our protagonist, Deku, however, has none; but he vows to be a hero. We do not get the run of the mill story where weak boy becomes strong because plot - looking at younaruto even though I adore you. It Is well crafted and well delivered while keeping high emotion and high anticipation - with some kickass moves.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThe movements, the character art. SO MUCH CHARACTER ART. You can't always tell if a character will be a main character, a side character, or just a passing conversation. It isn't like some anime where the main gets the cool hair, detailed design - EVERYONE looks different. It takes a lot of time to make each character with different augmentations, body types, and powers to make each scene look fluid and captivating. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nI don't know much about sound, but if I can think of absolutely nothing to complain about, then I have to give it a 10. AND THAT INTRO MUSIC AMIRITE?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nThis has some of the best character development in any anime I've seen. And not just for the main character - ALL characters. Each person is given a time to show how they've grown, and just how far every single person is growing. Deku especially, since he is a genuine cry baby, and learns to actually use his quirk and train himself to not just rush in with no plan. Relationships constantly are growing, and no one seems 2D or bland.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI. watched. 63. episodes. in. 3. days. NEXT\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nI think it speaks for itself. Sure, the first few episodes can be slow since so many people are being introduced, but it's not just a barrage of introductions. Each person being crafted and shown has a purpose that will carry through the anime and I honestly cannot praise this enough. \\n\\n\r\nSpecial thanks to my friend Katie for recommending this and dragging me into the abyss. xoxo",

It\u2019s just not amazing, and reason is because of the lack of development. The action in the show is really good and props to the show for actually trying with its massive supporting cast. However, the show does the same thing over and over and the worst part is that those parts are the good parts. When stuff is going on it feels fun and has you really involved and when stuff isn\u2019t eventful my god doesit feel like your having to trudge through snow. Besides being a lot lighter hearted and a completely different plot it does feel a bit like attack on titan with its massive hype and slow plot. Though I liked attack on titan so keep doing your thing my hero, but please make something different happen\u2026   \\n",

            "content": "So I'm usually not hopping on many shounen trains. I didn't want to dedicate the time to Naruto, and after I had the end of Bleach somewhat spoiled I felt strongly that I wouldn't get the payoff I was hoping for at the end. There are occasional ones like Hunter x Hunter and Kaguya (kinda seinen but it's in Young Jump). Despite all this BNHA managed to take my entire week away while I caught up on all three seasons. In this review I'll go into just season one, and say that it's definitely worth your time.\r\nStory: Oddly enough, the story was the weakest partfor me. I mean that insofar as the overall narrative is kinda all over the place. One moment you're not supposed to copy someone, the next you are; there's no real developed theme of how characters should develop besides \"Eh we'll deal with it at the time\". This can kinda get hectic when you see someone really develop a power and then they're like \"Alright, but now never do that again\". This isn't a huge issue, due to the amount of smaller arcs that the show pulls off very well and decisively. This makes it satisfying to see the end, but sometimes I found myself dragging in the middle of each arc.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: The style is just fantastic, I love the colors, the sounds, the effects. Each character (regardless of personality) looks distinct and distinguishable from the rest. The animation of each of these abilities is easily discernible as well. I did notice some background CGI for crowds in the distance occasionally, however it was only when my eyes would drift from what I was supposed to be focused on. The \"color coding\" of each hero really brings out the feeling of them being \"super heros\" in a very comic-like style that I really appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Honestly I think the characterization of these kids is the best part of the show. The way Deku and others advance, and all try to do their best is something I did not expect coming into this show. I expected so much focus on Deku with some side plots, however the show seems to care about each character introduced in some way or another.\\n\\n\r\nOverall and Enjoyment: This show is just like popcorn. It's not really something that might be satisfying until you eat a lot of it, so you'll just sit down and eat three entire bags until you're finished. This isn't a slap on the show either. I really enjoyed the time I invested to the point where I couldn't stop. If you want something to fill that void of shows that are only getting 2 seasons then stopping so you can go read the source material, you should definitely check this out.",

            "content": "The first season of Hero Academia introduces us to the show's universe and prepares the viewer for the next seasons. It is a solid addition to the shonen genre, though it comes with the usual weaknesses.\r\nStory: (Spoilers)\r\nIn a One Punch man-esque universe where everyone has a superpower, our protagonist, Deku, has none. \"All men are not created equal\" is the initial premise of the show. And though later on Deku is gifted with a power by captain America, I mean, All Might, he still needs to put effort in order to be even able to use his power. The show is telegraphing the viewer agood message, that no matter how you are born, you can put effort in order to achieve great things. My criticism to the initial premise of the show however, is that the message can be diluted by the fact that Deku is only able to become a hero because he got lucky and gifted a power. He then goes on to become the standard shonen hero archetype: a young man with great power struggling to control it. Nonetheless, it is a interesting twist to the shonen premise, but a basic shonen premise nonetheless. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nGreat animation and effects. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI like the opening and the sound effects give a lot of hype to the show's important moments. 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe many heroes and students of this show all feel very unique and distinct, so the show succeeds in providing a good diversity of characters and personalities. However, most of them seem shallow and one dimensional, even for shonen standards. Besides, the main characters of the show are a simple recycling of shonen's most overused archetypes. In terms of archetypes, the main character is not very different from Naruto or Goku, Bakugo is not very different from Sasuke, Ishida or Vegeta, and Uraraka is not very different from Sakura and Orihime. Which is mostly fine since this is after all a shonen, but I can't say the characters are very original other than their designs. I feel like a Yu Yu Hakusho for example, was a shonen with much more interesting main characters. I would normally give the characters of the show a mediocre grade, but each individual character's design is very unique and fits well with the universe. We also have some very interesting that stand out such as Eraser Head, Tomura Shigaraki and All Might. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI always find it enjoyable to discover a new interesting universe and characters. I think one of the great advantages Hero Academia has over most shonens, is that it feels much more fast paced. Previous shonens are infamous for the long drawn out fights and arcs, yet Hero Academia keeps it short and sweet. Also, the great animation and sound effects keep me hooked from start to finish. In short, this anime is much more efficient in delivering the overall shonen experience. So even though in principle the show does not bring anything new to the shonen genre in terms of plot and character development, it stills feels fresh and enjoyable. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt's a good show that benefits greatly from its good animation, though the characters and plot could be deeper. It remains a very enjoyable experience and is a good addition to the shonen genre. The first season got me interested and I will definitely watch the next seasons. 8/10",

            "content": "WARNING: SPOILERS\r\nMy Hero Academia was something that initially I had been avoiding to watch mainly because it came across to me that the story would mostly be told in the setting of middle school. This was not the case and I came to regret this when watching it. In my opinion, the story that this anime has is something that I feel is up there with Death Note (though nothing compares to the first half of Death Note I think we can all agree). I felt like My Hero Academia is objectively a good anime as well as a subjectively good anime. This anime issomething that created such emotion in the scenes that even I, as someone who doesn't really get emotional when watching anything, was beginning to tear up at some parts. The heroes initially I didn't really care much for the amount of characters there were, but I came to change my mind on this as well for the amount of interesting abilities that these characters had. Sure some of them are pretty much rip offs of other super heroes like Sero being a tape version of Spider Man, but I think that for the most part a lot of these abilities were rather interesting. I also think that the design for them all was phenomenal. The humor that this show has I think is just something that you either love or hate, and I don't think it's something for everyone but I personally enjoyed some of the less serious situations.\\n\\n\r\nFavorite Character: Tsuyu Asui\\n\r\nAsui was someone who initially I thought I wouldn't like but again, I came to have a change of heart. Her chill and calm attitude was great, and ability to perform well under stress in her given situations was great. She is able to comfort her classmates as well which is also pretty nice. Finally, her power was something that I wasn't expecting and was actually a lot cooler than it was going to seem.",

            "content": "*mild spoilers, please watch out qwq really nothing major, mostly just things that are covered in the first few episodes.*\r\nBoku no Hero Academia is the story of Izuku Midoriya, a seemingly fun, lighthearted, enjoyable shounen show that has taken *some* inspiration from western comic-books and the world of superheroes, and I have to say, for me season one was exactly that, with some surprises and unexpectedly good parts thrown in!\r\nSo let's talk about how this first season, while being the worst out of the three so far in my mind, was the start of an anime that eventually became one of my favourites!\r\nStory - (7 )\\n\\n\r\nThe show begins with, as stated above, our main character, Izuku Midoriya, a take on the probably well-known introverted, anxious, but intelligent type who, in this world where supernatural abilities - named quirks - suddenly emerged, is in the now rare group of people who are \"quirkless\", attracting bullying in school, predominantly by his much more powerful classmate Bakugo who, on the surface, seems like the typical mindless bully.\\n\\n\r\nIzuku's life is filled with anxiety and he's trying to come to terms with the fact that his childhood dreams of becoming a hero will never come true, and that his idolising of his favourite hero, All Might, will stay just that - idolising, never being able to realistically aspire to such goals, but, of course, this is a shounen and the story quickly picks up as All Might notices Izuku, deeming him heroic enough to inherit his powers, becoming his mentor.\\n\\n\r\nFairly standard, even clich\u00e9 story but with surprisingly good execution and the great characters (we'll get to that ^^) and their dynamics raise it to a standard where this simple premise becomes something great.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9)\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say on this front, it's great! ^^\\n\\n\r\nit's a crisp, sharp, colourful animation style that's a mix between anime and basically any superhero comic-book from the last three decades with plenty of good motion, effects, and action, good flow, all the things you could want, it's not flawless, but more than good enough!\\n\\n\r\nSound ( 9 )\\n\\n\r\nAgain, not much to say on this front, other than it's really impressive in my mind, the voice actors and actresses are doing a fantastic job (in the Japanese dub at least, don't @ me about the English dub qwq)\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is wonderful, even good enough to listen to by itself for me, particular highlights of it for me personally as far as season 1 goes are You Say Run, an exciting, well-composed music track perfect for action (that I'm also listening to as I'm writing this) and All Might's Theme, a great re-imagination of classical superhero themes!\\n\\n\r\nI don't have many complaints as far as the sound goes, it's great, it fits, let's move on, I tend to write too much.. ^^\\n\\n\r\nCharacter ( 9 )\\n\\n\r\nI'm so, so tempted to give character a 10, and spoiler, in my later reviews I most likely will.\\n\\n\r\nHeroAca, at its heart, is a character-focused shounen action anime and that more than shows.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are very important to me and HeroAca thoroughly impressed me, even the more stereotypical, clich\u00e9 characters are executed very well and they end up feeling so, so fresh and fun, not just the protagonist Izuku but the deuteragonists, tritagonists, and background characters too!\\n\\n\r\nSeason one is especially focused on Izuku though, like most of the show, but even more so in the first season I feel like, Izuku is a timid, introverted, awkward, but passionate protagonist who you can't help liking and rooting for, his main motivation is to become a hero and save people with a smile, to become what he idolises and aspires to be.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I hadn't talked about before which I've been reserving until now is how much I love Izuku's power and effectiveness as a character. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason for the criticised slow pace of the show is that it's slow because while yes, the story and worldbuilding are important, what's important right now is to see Izuku grow and follow him along his journey as he gets used to his newfound powers which, as of now, literally destroy his body, shatter his bones, and we follow along as he trains and uses creative, smart thinking to do his best while he's still very limited.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on about different characters but take my word, they're great, I'll need to have a long character analysation about mainly Deku, Todoroki, Bakugo, and perhaps a few more in the future though!\\n\\n\r\nAlso, PS, I hate Mineta -w-\\n\r\nJapan, please, stop including pervy characters for no real reason :c \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment ( 8 )\\n\\n\r\nLet's wrap up this review now as I'm really getting carried away, HeroAca is a highly enjoyable show that yes, perhaps doesn't have the breakneck pace of similar shounens but still entertains and hooks you as you go, as you fall in love with every character except Mineta, as you enjoy the ride and see the characters grow before your eyes, whether they grow by themselves, by their mentors, or by motivating each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe pace does pick up slowly with the further seasons and, in my opinion, they're written much better as well, but season one is good at what it does - being a much needed introduction to a super fun, great show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall ( 8 )\\n\\n\r\nOverall I have to give season one an 8 as it's great, but aside from the, in my mind, emotional and amazing first two episodes and a few very fun fights, isn't much more then a setup for further things to come, and the writing could use some improvement which it definitely gets later on! ^^\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\\n\r\nThe start of a fun, very well-executed shounen show with plenty of unique things to set it apart from the other shounen giants, great characters, audio, and visuals, and a - so far - simplistic story that's fine as is, as it works.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThank you so much for reading my first review! ^^",

            "content": "Things with this anime is: it is hot-blood, a bit cliche, very fluid action scene, smooth like Stein Gate, and does the job well as an anime.\r\nI mean, the pacing of the whole anime is so nice. It is very enjoyable to watch through this popular shouen.\r\nYes, I know the story is not as great as Fullmetal Alchemist, but as a general audience I found the Art, All the BGM (if you noticed that the name \"porno graffitti\" appear in the opening of the Anime, trust me you can google the name safely haha, I tried it, trust me.), the way they present this anime,it is top-notch.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty usual shounen style, A boy want to have power, no power? Never mind, the guys in your neighborhood happens to have the strongest ability, and pass it to you in a bizarre way. At least in Season 1, story is not this anime biggest strength. Oh, I forget he has a gay friend as well, arrogant and stupid at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to character development, I found it our main protagonist has a plausible character development. At the very least, he is not born with a nine tail beast (I am looking at Naruto) or someone with unexplained absurd ability on evasion and tackle girls (hello SAO). He become stronger and stronger throughout the story, in a way that make me almost believe becoming superheroes is possible.\\n\\n\r\nBut Boi, I enjoy this anime. It boils the blood inside me. It makes me wanna shout out: Go get it! As thought I am in the fighting scene. The fighting scene give me a feeling similar to Saitama, very enjoyable. The pacing, lighting, audio and art, everything whirl up to be an insanely satisfying tornado that leave me \"Aweeeeeee\".\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for some light, fun and action-packed anime, with a superior tempo, this is the anime for you. If you like Fullmetal Alchemist, Stein Gate, Saitama, Attack of Titan, I bet you will like this anime as well. At least there is something common in all these anime: it is a feast that you don't want to miss it.\\n",

But there are simply things that cannot be overlooked.\r\nI am actually amazed at how much of a bunch of fucking hypocrites anime fans are. This story has nothing original. We complain about Naruto and friends being cancer because \"they are not original\", yet the same people praise this anime as a masterpiece. Good job anime community. You did it again.\r\nI cannot believe this anime is ranked #190. I can see at least why Re:Zero is ranked #64 but this, this does not deserve any kind of recognition. It's so FUCKINGGENERIC. \\n\\n\r\nI really like the characters designs and the art overall. All characters look different and you can tell a lot of effort went into designing them. The animation isn't bad, nothing outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know why the world is so similar to ours when more than 80% of the population of Earth have super powers. Almost nothing has changed! \\n\r\nSomething that bothered me is how this show treats discrimination. It is revealed later in the series that if you are not born with super powers, you can acquire them. This isn't a good message for children. They contradict themselves multiple times. So like, if you are born without powers you can only acquire them? Not through hard work? Great. In Naruto they also make this mistake, but in Shippuden.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime couldn't be more generic. It is enjoyable, but it does not deserve any of the hype. 1 dimensional characters. Unlikeable brats (Not that I have a problem with unlikeable characters, I do like the well written ones) and many plot holes. \\n\r\nThe only good thing about this series is All might. \\n\\n\r\nAND DON\"T GET ME STARTED ON THE PLOT DEVI-\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this short review.",

Ties right into the story of this show, What is a hero and Why do I want to be one? The answer is different depending on who you ask. Some see a hero/this show as oppressive, while others see it as an inspiration. I see it as the latter, please read onto see why. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nMost similar to X-Men or Naruto in that pretty much everyone is given a chance to be a \"hero\" its just some don't pursue it or are given a worst hand in life. \\n\\n\r\n                                                                        STORY\\n\r\n-Underdog story\\n\r\n-Overall grounded despite dealing with superhero society\\n\r\n-Great job of limiting powerful abilities \\n\r\n-Good at throwing in twists and very good at building tension\\n\r\n-Diversified conflicts (personal, Interpersonal and physical)  for not only the main character but side characters \\n\r\n-Demonstrate humans do heroic things, not superheroes do heroic things . \\n\r\n-Plot of the show is constantly in motion, IT RESPECTS YOUR TIME\\n\r\n-Has many deep themes. Bullying, self esteem, idolizing, insecurity, mortality, and being a parent/mentor are just some aspects explored in just 13 episodes\\n\\n\r\n                                                                         ART\\n\\n\r\n-Top notch  \\n\r\n-Moments of just lip flapping are short lived especially for a certain character that is overly expressive with his hands \\n\r\n-Characters are expressive and have a colorful appearance\\n\r\n-Tied in with great animation is the cleverness put into the use of quirks in the show. Despite a character having the ability to cause explosions he utilizes them in unbelievably creative ways. -Fights although short lived feel very impactful  and are really easy to follow. The last big fight in the season being particularity great with phenomenal camera work and visual effects that enhance not obscure the scenes.\\n\\n\r\n                                                                      SOUND\\n\\n\r\n-Contends with the amazing OSTs in shows like Attack on Titan and Hunter x Hunter\\n\r\n-Worth listening to even if you don't watch the show\\n\r\n-Music is utilized to enhance what the scene is trying to portray from sadness to hype\\n\r\n-Some soundtracks will make you re- envision those particular impactful moments in the show \\n\r\n-Prefer the Subbed voice actors but that's not to take away from the good English dubbed as well\\n\r\n-The Subbed cast are phenomenal you really couldn't have picked more suitable VAs for all the characters because even the side ones do a great job \\n\\n\r\n                                                                  CHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\n-The VAs are complimented by the phenomenal characters in the show\\n\r\n- A variety of characters are multi dimensional and all bring a unique perspective\\n\r\n-They think and behave realistically and some under go development\\n\r\n-Change doesn't always occur by characters fighting sometimes its done indirectly \\n\r\n-This shows complexity comes from its characters depth and also from the world being very well connected by those characters\\n\r\n-Wide range of personalities and abilities makes for great interactions  \\n\r\n-Your sure to find someone that you can get behind\\n\\n\r\nMy utter enjoyment of the show is undeniable. There is an episode that the characters mention is \u201cright out of a comic book\u201d I couldn\u2019t agree more. That moment to me captured perfectly what I love about shounen anime, the ability to defy unfavorable odds and surpass your limits. This show just cuts to the heart of things whether it be those depressive down moments or those elated nothing can stop me moments.\\n\\n\r\nAs a homage to Western comic book heroes and all the shounen shows prior to this anime, My Hero Academia is an amalgamation of what makes a show go PLUS ULTRA. With the mangakas Kohei Horikoshi very soul put into this series, teamed up with the phenomenal production done by Studio Bones you have a timeless anime that has gotten the attention of millions and will continue to inspire those that want a HERO.",

            "content": "When you watch Boku no Hero Academia, you may feel a void in yourself. A strange one, not clearly understandable at first. And it grows from the first episode to the thirteenth. Whatever enjoyment you may gain from the show is not enough to fill that void.\r\nThen you realize it's a good thing.\r\nThat void is your brain knowing the enjoyment will last thirteen episodes and no more. At least not for a year. That void is frustration, and it comes like this because the anime has incredible potential and is good enough to make you desire for more.\r\nI exaggerate a bit, but there are reallyfew blames to put on Boku no Hero Academia. Art is good, even if, like me, you're not a big fan of that style. Animation is good. The score is great and fits perfectly. The story is trending but, like One-Punch Man, it transcends the boundaries of the genre by playing with the rules and expectations of both sh\u014dnen/nekketsu and super heroes to bring something fresh, something new, something intelligent, and the entertainment that goes with it.\\n\\n\r\nEven the aforementioned blames we could cast on the show aren't really flaws. At worst they are narrative choices and their worth lies on personal appreciation more than a scholar one. With so few episodes, the story is only at it's beginning, but it's a promising one since it succeeds in every delivery: action! comedy! thriller! drama! But \u2014and maybe this is a flaw\u2014 the characters are great and well-written, we follow the lead all the way, but they aren't bigger than the world and the promises the show brings to us. So, even with everything else running smoothly, some coldness lingers. You can't really put a finger on it, but you've got the feeling.\\n\\n\r\nOr maybe it's because you want more and already know you can't have it right now!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway: a kid's feeling!\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's why it's so good.",

            "content": "I should note before I dive into my review that this counts for my experience with the show up to season three, not just season one. The following simply explains why this has been one of my favorite shows to watch so far. It's long-winded, but if you're looking for an extremely detailed review, here you go:\r\n(STORY) First off, my review of the show's plot is going to be long- only because there's so much substance when it comes to this show. The story is a strong 8 (leaning towards a 9). It doesn't deviate too much from the typical shonen jump \"underdog\" trope, consideringhow the series is introduced as the story of a quirkless protagonist, who eventually becomes the greatest hero of all time. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, story isn't just defined by plot and so we should consider other factors: the characterization of this show is brilliant (for example, Shoto Todoroki's backstory) and the creator of the show (as you'll also see in the manga) isn't afraid to jump into darker themes such as abuse, altruism and fame, and revenge. \\n\\n\r\nIt's actually these exact themes that expand the boundaries of this show, because the things we normally don't talk about and keep buried within us, are easier to relate to when we see it expressed outwardly on a screen. It's an underdog's story, but with twists that prevent it from being just another heroic tale. Viewers will feel for at least one of the main characters, because they'll see that the glory and glamorization of being a hero isn't all that's there to it. \\n\\n\r\nThe need to be the best, the need to stand out amongst others and the thin line between saving others and living off their gratitude (ie. being a hero for the fame and creating a \"good\", reassuring image of peace in society) are noteworthy ideas explored quite precisely here- and you'll notice them more and more as you continue watching.\\n\\n\r\n(CHARACTERS) Speaking of characterization, Izuku is also not your typical shonen protagonist. He loses when he has to lose, and his power-ups actually make sense. He's intelligent from the beginning and is idealistic without being too righteous or preachy. He's fully aware of his strengths and weaknesses, and acknowledges what he's been given instead of taking it for granted. \\n\\n\r\n(SOUND/ ART) I want to make a note about the soundtrack for BNHA because it's honestly quite fitting. You'll find a lot of the OST's in \"epic anime music\" compilations on YouTube for example- the songs themselves are heroic and effectively add to the buildup of fights. The soundtrack has a vibe of its own, where you hear it and you just know it's BNHA (most of them utilize orchestra/ strings)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fantastic. Of course old- school anime has its own appeal, but the art of this show is representative of how far animation has come. It makes the impact of every movement, even slightly raising your pinkie finger look large and powerful- and looks even more epic when matched with the soundtrack. It emphasizes how \"out-of-this-world\" this universe is and literally makes the characters appear godly. (Anyone who's watched the tournament arc will know what I'm talking about). \\n\\n\r\nI am fully aware of how unnecessarily long this review is- and I'm not ashamed. I put in an hour for this review- because BNHA is that worth it. \\n",

It jumps from one emotional swell to another without any quiet, subtle, reflective moments.\r\nIt is a typical shonen anime and the main audience is young boys which both helps and hurts the show. It helps by encouraging charismatic and interesting characters. The action is original and fun. The animation and score sell the scenes to great effect.\r\nAt the same time, it is a detriment because limits nuance and mature storytelling. The show has a lot of great themes: definition of heroism, whether people are born better or can become better with effort, the line betweengood and evil, the role of parents and mentors, and general coming of age themes. But, the show lacks the follow through to address them well and just hopes that the intense music and crying will convey the message.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I had a lot of fun, but it felt hollow. There was a lot of potential for a unique anime, but the creators felt the need to cater to the expectations of the audience rather that be innovative and surprising. It is not anime for the ages, but I doubt that, that was the goal.",

            "content": "\"There's a hero in all of us\"\r\nI don't watch a lot of shounen shows because I just don't like them in general but My Hero Academia is quite different from other shounen shows out there and it's one of the main reasons why I enjoyed the series so much.\r\n[Story]: (8/10)\r\nMy Hero Academia wasn't my most hyped anime because I thought it was going to be a typical shounen anime that we already have seen..*Ahem* The big 3 and countless more shounens out there. *ahem* but this series really surprised me. My friends who knows me knows that I'm the kind of person who likes tocheer for the underdogs because cheering for people who are very talented and can beat opponents easily is very boring. There's just this different kind of excitement that you get when cheering for the underdogs and that's what I got from watching My Hero Academia. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot of the series is basically about a young guy named Izuki Midoriya. 80% of humanity has this power called \"quirk\". In other words, abilities and superpowers. Midoriya is one of the 20% who doesn't have a quirk but he still dreams to become a hero and never gives up. One day, he met his idol, All Might (the greatest superhero in the world). All Might saw something interesting about Midoriya. He knew he has the potential to become a hero so he passed down his ability to Midoriya and decides to train him. Midoriya then decides to join U.A, the most prestigious school in the city, and he learns what it truly means to become a hero. \\n\\n\r\nIzuku's determination.....His drive to become a hero is what got me cheering for Midoriya. In the earlier part of the series, we see Midoriya doing everything he can to try and become a hero despite the fact that it's impossible to become one unless he has a quirk. I don't know about you guys but I got this strange feeling, like someone's gripping my heart whenever I see Midoriya backed into the corner. It's just very painful to see someone fail even though they worked so hard to try and achieve their goal. Yes, I admit, there were tears in my eyes and I cried a little bit because I felt for him. No surprise; he managed to overcome his own weakness, with the help of All Might, and this is what led him to become a hero.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think there's anything more to talk about the show in terms of story because it is still a pretty typical shounen story. A villian whose plan is to do villainous things disrupts the people's way of life and the good guys comes and saves the day. \\n\\n\r\nWhat sets this series apart from other shounen shows out though is the fact that Midoriya is not an overpowered MC. He inherited a powerful quirk from All Might but we see him, throughout the series, still struggling to use his currently obtained quirk. He isn't some one man army that can easily defeat a villian by going super saiyan mode. Speaking of one man army, that term doesn't even exist in this series. I was actually surprised to see all of them devising a plan and working together. This series encourages teamwork.. When was the last time you've seen that in a shounen series?\\n\\n\r\nI honestly wish My Hero Academia could have been a 2-cour series because based on the pacing of this season, it felt like a whole giant setup to what was about to happen in the next season. I mean, I'm not complaining or anything. In fact, I'm glad the pacing was slow because they took all the time they need to focus not only on Midoriya's character but also the other main and side characters. Although, I'm glad that the 2nd Season was confirmed right after the show ended and now....The Waiting Game begins!\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nI've been reading Marvel comics for as long as I can remember and when I first saw the show's art-style, it honestly felt like I was watching a Marvel comic being animated. It didn't even feel like I was watching an anime at first. I just love MHA's unique artstyle. I do have a bit of complaint when it comes to the animation. Mainly, the fighting scenes. Half of the time, the fighting scenes are very unappealing to watch because it's inconsistent as hell. For example, 15 seconds of somewhat smooth fighting scene then it switches to an \"animated slide show (with those white moving lines on the sides)\" effect. I just didn't like it. The character designs are also pretty good but with few female characters being subjected to fanservice. There's not a lot though so thank God for that.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (10/10)\\n\r\nNo brainer, My Hero Academia easily won the best Soundtrack of Spring 2016. The battle OST's are so goddamn good and the insert songs....My god, the insert songs is what made the action scenes so worth watching. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"The Day\" by Porno Graffiti. The name of the band is Porno Graffiti hmm?? Yea..I'm not even going to make a joke about that name because I don't have the energy as of the time I'm writing this. Anyways, the song is ok. Nothing too special and I'll doubt I'll remember it in the future. The ED theme song is \"HEROES\" by Brian the Sun. Haha, that moment when the ED theme song is a whole lot better than the OP theme song. I love the singer's voice, the buildup before the chorus and the chorus itself. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (9/10)\\n\r\nWe don't really get a lot of characters like Midoriya. Maybe, we do but not as a protagonist so this series was kind of a breath of fresh air in terms of a protagonist being powerless. Izuku Midoriya is one of the few main characters that got the most screentime and character development so I'm only going to focus on him and not so much on the side characters. The side characters were pretty entertaining though but I don't want to get into that right now. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't see Izuku Midoriya as some cliched shounen-type protagonist who can defeat any enemies he wants and if he can't defeat said enemies, it will later turn out that he has some hidden special power that he never knew had. I just saw Midoriya as some regular powerless kid who has a dream/goal but he couldn't achieve it at first due to his circumstances. Of course, he gets a quirk later on in the series but like I said earlier in the review, he doesn't turn into an overpowered \"one man-army\" character. The series emphasizes teamwork and that's one of the few aspects that I love about this series. This becomes pretty notable at the final arc of this season when the students are forcibly separated into small groups and are forced to work together to defeat the villains. How were they separated? If I answer that question then I'm going to cross the spoiler zone so I won't answer the question.  \\n\\n\r\nThe character development for Midoriya was amazing. As you watch the series, you'll notice the changes in Midoriya's character as he tries to become a hero but first, he has to go through certain obstacles to achieve his dream. One of the key factors to his character development is Bakugou and All Might. \\n\\n\r\nAt first, All Might is like how everyone see's him. He's a symbol of peace and his a perfect hero. While the former may be true, the latter is what will surprise the viewers. He may seem perfect but every time he gets out there and do his usual hero stuff, I can't help but feel nervous for him and this is actually the first time I feel nervous for a character who's very powerful but has a weakness that's obviously holding him back. \\n\\n\r\nI'm surprised that all of My Hero Academia's supporting characters are very entertaining to watch. Even though they're not as fleshed out as the main characters, each one of them has a unique personality and it didn't feel like they were just there just to fill up the tables in Midoriya's class. Each one of them is likable and we get to know them when the show decides to give them a slight introduction of their character and their quirk. It's really interesting how the show wants you to see the supporting characters as part of the team and someone you should care for rather than throwing them in the trashcan and not giving them a slightest bit of screentime just because they're a \"supporting character\". For example, Tsuyu is a supporting character and she's really beginning to be my best girl of the series due to how they portrayed her in the final arc. For now though, Uraraka is still my best girl of the series. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (9/10)\\n\r\nLike I said earlier in my review, MHA wasn't my most hyped series because it's a shounen series and I got tired of that genre long time ago. MHA was something different and it's a shounen series that I really enjoyed so much. I might get back to watching shounen again \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\nMy Hero Academia is a shounen series but it sets itself apart from other shounen shows out there. Instead of your usual overpowered MC defeating villians, this is more of an exciting and emotional series that focuses on the MC's character growth on his path to become a hero. If you're a fan of the shounen genre and you want something new then MHA is definitely recommended. If you're not a fan of the genre then you might still want to check out MHA because it is a different take on the usual shounen shows that we get these days. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Different take on an overdone shounen genre\\n\r\n+Focuses more on Midoriya's character growth rather than him being an Overpowered MC. \\n\r\n+Unique art-style\\n\r\n+Intense OST and insert songs\\n\r\n+Great cast of characters\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Action scenes sometimes felt like an \"animated slide show\"\\n",

            "content": "I have to say I wasn't a big shounen fan but my mind changed completely after watching My Hero Academia. What an incredible feat let's get started. \r\nStory - 8\r\nThe story is a classic among shounen series, a guy gets superpowers. Yeah, yeah then why is Boku No Hero Academia special? Because it presents us a situation where any young teen or young adult can put himself/herself in. A young boy wants to become a hero in a world full of heroes. This is the same as a young boy wanting to become an astronaut in reality or wanting to become anything. My Hero Academiapresents us a story with one simple gist, a boy trying to make his dream a reality. It's easily a spot anyone can put their shoes in and that's the beauty of the story. Well what's the downside? The show somewhat loses a bit of charisma and becomes more a school show with no real plot except for a teen trying to make his dream come true against multiple rivals. What turned the story around was the introduction of villains. That's right, the villains are absolutely superb and towards the end of the season, the show brought a whole new dynamic to the series. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art is clearly a clear highlight for the show. The fights and animation are just superb and the character designs are comical but match the theme of the show. The art is incredibly lively and you'll just feel alive while watching the visual beauty of the show. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\\n\r\nI think Boku No Hero Academia is like the only show I'll ever give a 10 for it's sound. Everything about the soundtrack and OST is just perfect. It couldn't have been done better. The OSTs highlight the emotions and key moments of the show to the point where you start to feel the emotions and feels running throughout your veins. Incredible composing and sound directing. I literally teared up just on the second episode just because of the soundtrack(I have it downloaded on my phone). I can't praise the music enough for Boku No Hero Academia.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are blast to watch, their energy, their rage, their compassion. Everything about them is great. Except one guy who's a complete asshole. The characters experience tremendous amounts of development and it's an absolutely amazing experience to watch them on screen. The only reason I'm giving the characters an 8 is because of the asshole whom I extremely disliked. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\\n\r\nThis show was just superb to watch, I had a blast watching this and literally forced myself not to binge so I could enjoy it at its most. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSuperb anime! A must watch for any shounen lover. Any person with a goal and dreams in life can certainly relate to this anime despite its fictional theme. Overall just a splendid anime to watch. \\n\\n",

            "content": "As you can probably see from my DP and favorites list, I am a huge fan of the franchise. Because of the strong feelings I have towards MHA, this will obviously effect the overall score of my review. I just want you to know that this is the opinion of someone who is already a fan of the story.\r\nStory - 7\r\nMy Hero Academia is without a doubt a shonen story. A weak protagonist who struggles to be good at what he does, but never gives up. If you are a fan of mangas and anime such as Naruto, One Piece, Bleach, and Hunter X Hunter,then you will probably love this anime. However, this series only consists of 13 episodes, and the anime was being created when the first volume wasn't even released yet, therefore there wasn't a lot of content when they were making this show, and it is very apparent. The first 2 episodes adapted the first issue, and pacing was a huge problem at that time. However, right after Deku finished his training, the story becomes more and more interesting as it progresses. Despite this, the entire season adapts only the entrance exam arc, the quick apprehension test arc, the battle trial arc, and the USJ arc. In my opinion, these were the most underwhelming arcs of My Hero Academia, because they weren't anything special. While the stories were definitely executed perfectly, it was still a run of the mill shonen story at the time. As the series progresses on, it becomes more and more unique as Horikoshi begins to find what works in the stories and what don't. Sadly none of the better arcs weren't adapted for this season, however what we were given were excellently executed and adapted, but not as unique as it could have been.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I always loved about the manga was the art. It was very cartoony and had a sense of adrenaline in the action scenes of the manga. Horikoshi was also known for his incredibly detailed drawings in key scenes. Perfect examples are when Deku punched the zero point robot in the entrance exam, and the introduction of Shigaraki. The anime does a good job of mimicking the art style of Shigaraki, but fails to achieve the same level of detail and adrenaline in the art style. While the animation in the anime is fantastic and exciting, it still does not compare to the amazingly detailed stills that Horikoshi draws in his manga. Deku's punch scene in the entrance exam was less exciting and Shigaraki's introduction was less creepy. However, the anime is still very beautiful with it's vibrant colors, fantastic art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\\n\r\nWhen this anime was announced, and I heard that Kenji Nagasaki was directing this anime, I prayed everyday hoping that Yuki Hayashi would compose the music for this anime, and my prayers were answered. The result is a fantastic soundtrack that adds to the emotion in scenes. The soundtrack never fails to give me goosebumps. The soundtrack he composed for MHA is just as good as his work on Haikyuu, so if you are the type of person to search anime soundtracks on youtube, I suggest you give the MHA soundtrack a listen. I cannot critique the voice acting because I do not understand japanese. All i can say is that the voices fit the characters. Deku sounds wimpy, Ochako sounds adorable, Tenya sounds uptight, and All Might sounds manly, and that's good enough for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the limitations of an anime, a lot of characters weren't given a lot of time to develop. Ochako is a huge example of that because in the manga, we see the relationship she has with Deku develop in these arcs, however in the manga, a lot of that is cut out. We still see them bond, but the sense of trust they have for each other is not apparent compared to the manga. Hopefully in the second season, more episodes are created so that some characters can develop. It's just one of the limitations of having a 1 cour season. Still, All might and Deku and the villains are interesting enough to keep the show interesting, and even if side characters are not given the spotlight, the characters that ARE given the spotlight are well developed and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\\n\r\nAs an adaption, it's not perfect, but as a fan, I'm glad that this series stayed faithful to the manga despite the limitations. There is no filler, and that's all I need to say.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10 (personal score)           8 (score based on my review)\\n\\n\r\nI'm giving this a 10 simply because I am a huge fan of the manga and the story, and I think the anime does an outstanding job in adapting it. However, if i were to review it as it is. I would give it an 8. As of right now, the story doesn't do much to differentiate itself from other shonen anime. It definitely does a better job than most shonens, but nonetheless it still can be considered generic in its current state. Not much happens in this season, and the villains were only introduced in the latter part of the season. It's not as exciting as people hoped for. Is it a disappointment? No, it is not, at least for fans of the original manga. Is it a great anime despite its shortcomings? Yes it definitely is. Will this show change my opinions on shonens if I am not a huge fan of that genre? No, this is not a Fullmetal Alchemist or a Hunter X Hunter. Rather, this is a more fleshed out and refined Naruto. Would I recommend it? Yes, definitely keep on watching at least till episode 5. If you like the anime till that episode, then you will love the rest. However if you are not a fan when you reach episode 5, then stop watching. Either way, I personally LOVE this anime, and I can't wait for the second season!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I however believe it does deserve the hype.\r\nStory: 7 \r\n While yes I did just say this anime did deserve the hype I believe the story is it's weakest point. The story is a combination of many classic anime/manga stereo types they are done in a way that feel new and fresh enough for you to enjoy. This also makes you want to root for our heroes without following traditiontoo much to the point where it feels like a straight up ripoff. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\n  There isn't a ton to say here the designs are fun and match their quirk. In addition I like colorful art. d-; \\n\\n\r\nSound:9 \\n\\n\r\n This is probably one of my single handily favorite tracks in all of anime history.\\n\r\nThe OST You Can Be A Hero really matches the scene. in addition the opening is well done and enjoyable and a year later it is still one of the songs \\n\r\nI listen to most.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nMany people Are gonna hate me for this being the first 10 of the review hear me out. I will admit all the characters are fairly simplistic however that isn't a bad thing. Izuku and Bakugo have one of the best rivalries since Naruto and Sasuke and work very well with each other. They both push each other forward towards there goals. The other characters such as All Might are enjoyable a well. They are funny and interact well. In addition Izuku has the ability to make you see yourself in him. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally we are at the last stage of the review. You may be surprised the series got a 10\\n\r\nOut of 10 from me considering I gave it more 9 scores than anything else. However what really drove the series home for me was Izuku. He worked hard like I want to believe I do and in in the end his dreams came true. This show inspires a certain hope in the people that watch it that can't quite be found anywhere else. With the combined experience taken to account this leads to give the anime a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nHave any questions? Want to tell me why I'm wrong? Enjoy the series as well and just want to talk to me about it as well? Message me and I will respond within 24 hours.",

            "content": "My Hero Academia (MHA) doesn't try too hard to break out of certain well-established formulas, but the execution is solid and the themes have a universal appeal. I feel that the creators of MHA have tapped the same sweet spot that western franchises like X-men and Harry Potter have, combining themes of growing up and fighting for what you believe in a setting where there is a clear distinction between good and evil. \r\nMaybe it will come later, but don't expect to see much philosophy in MHA season 1. Like another hugely popular show Fairy Tail (which I had to drop), MHA is heavily dependenton giant chains of fight sequences that often don't have much context other than the typical \"hey, I'm the next bad guy and I'm here to kick your ass!\"\\n\\n\r\n//spoilers below\\n\\n\r\nStory: \"fair\" because while it wasn't a bad story, it was extremely generic and didn't really offer anything new or interesting. That's not a bad thing, but high ratings in this category (at least for me) require either more originality or substance. MHA is a simple and enjoyable story, and it's strength is in execution.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Character design looks great, and might be my favorite thing about the show. Certain characters like the frog girl (Asui) have a really distinct and well-thought-out look compared to more \"regular-looking\" characters like Iida, but what makes it great is that the characters' personalities fit the way they look. And it's interesting, because you wonder whether they act that way BECAUSE they look that way or whether the way we see them as the viewer is warped by our own biases.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation was also great, and fight scenes were very satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nSound: It was good. It's not that the soundtrack was bad, I've just been spoiled by too many good soundtracks since I started rating these things. Nothing stood out too much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: As mentioned in the art section, character design (both appearance and script) was excellent, and probably the one thing that MHA really excelled in. At the end of season 1 we already have a pretty big cast of characters that we care about, and that's enough for me to want to see this show through the next season and probably beyond. Tsuyu Asui and Deku in particular had a great dynamic that I'd like to see more of.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Very good! Because the show stays simple and true to the hero & academy genres, there isn't much complexity and not that much room for the creators to screw it up. As a result, we have a show that doesn't take too many risks and reaps the reward of not making any major mistakes. That predictable but somewhat satisfying arc makes for a very enjoyable 13-episode stretch.\\n\\n\r\nI'm really looking forward to going through season 2, and now that there is an established cast of characters I'm looking forward to seeing them develop and finding out some more about their backstories. While MHA isn't going to blow you away, I don't see why anyone would trash the show or give it a really low score. It's pretty solid.",

I watched bits and pieces of Naruto and Dragon Ball Z so this is my first shounen anime I actually sat through and watched the whole way through. I was a little leery of it since I heard it's a superhero anime that's based on Marvels and DC Comics and I was never much of a fan of their movies but I was surprised that I actually found this anime quite enjoyable. That made me think that maybe I don't like watching superhero films because the theater makes them loud and all that and I am sensitive to loudsounds, I thought it was also the speed of them. It's weird though because I like action stuff.\\n\\n\r\nI can't compare this to other shounen anime since I haven't seen much of them yet. The story is immersive and creative. It made me wish that we lived in a world full of quirks. It showed the great intensity of trying to become a hero, well-written in a way that most superhero movies don't do.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all were distinct with unique personalities and abilities. All-Might was compelling and strong with a charming, likeable personality. Aizawa is an attractive, cool teacher even if he can be too strict. Ochako is a bit too polite but I still think she is a great character mainly because of her cheerful, amiable attitude and also she FLIES. Asui can say things that may offend people but she's also sensible enough to not be annoying with it. The only ones I didn't like were Izuku (wipe your snot, Izuku) and Mineta, who were crybabies but also in the case of Mineta, perverted. Izuka is not as bad as Mineta, he's just mediocre but what I liked about him is that he's cute and badass. Oh, I almost forgot Katsuki is another character I don't like because I don't like overconfident hot-headed characters and he was such a bully to poor Izuka.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a little simplistic and nothing to write home about, the animation however is charming. It's one of the anime that has a really good dub, the actors were charming, funny and brought fresh life to their characters. I love its goofy comedy and its exciting action. The anime is a bit derivative and not completely groundbreaking but it executes most of its tropes creatively.",

            "content": "\"Can someone without a quirk become a hero like you?\"\r\nBoku no Hero Academia, or My Hero Academia is the One Punch Man of this season that is nothing at all like One Punch Man.  What I mean is that almost everybody has been hyping up the manga ever since it's release in 2014.  I'm not a huge manga reader, so MHA is completely new to me, and when this anime appeared in the Spring 2016 season, I decided to add it to my list of anime that I would watch that season, and what did I think? Well, let's find out.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nIn aworld where a majority of Earth has superpowers, otherwise known as Quirks, one of the 10% of Quirkless, known as Midorya Izuku, or Deku as his classmates call him, is a complete fanboy for the heroes of the world.  He's especially fond of the Symbol of Peace, All Might, who is his inspiration to become a hero, despite his lack of powers.  The story of the anime is very simple, an eager teenager wants to become a hero, and this isn't something that we haven't seen before, so if you're expecting something different from the Shounen genre, you won't find it in My Hero Academia.  However, if you're fine with these types of stories, you won't have a problem here.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 8/10\\n\r\nBones Studio.  Must I say more?  With some exceptional series in the past like Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Eureka Seven, it's no surprise at this point that Bones is reliable when it comes to action anime, so it gets a plus on my part.  Also, the terribly named Porno Graffiti did an excellent job with the anime's opening: \"The Day.\"  Upbeat and catchy, I saw myself watching the opening every time I watched a new episode, and it reminded me of why I still watched the show like I did.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10.\\n\r\nOh boy, are there a lot of characters in this anime.  While they don't try to overload you with characters, the anime does do a good job at introducing characters and giving them some interesting personalities.  One character I liked the most was Iida; I liked his strict and serious attitude, and some of the funniest moments came from when he would take a situation way too seriously, like explaining how \"prestigious\" his school is.  However, the main characters aren't all that bad either.  Young Midorya isn't an overpowered badass like you may think he is, he has his flaws, he feels emotions, and he stands up to his fears even if it means he'll damage his body even further.  Some characters show up from time to time, but you never get to know the characters further, only their powers.  Some characters get the spotlight, some don't; it's that simple.  One character I thought would get more screen time and even possibly win best girl of the show was Mina, who is some sort of alien-like character.  She stood out the most out of the side characters, and it's a shame that she didn't get as much screen time as she could have, considering 3 other characters got as much attention as Iida, Bakugou, or Uraraka.   Speaking of which, out of all the main characters that I had a problem with, Bakugou was the one I had the most issues with.  Throughout the entirety of the anime, it's proven time and time again that he's only there to be a rival, nothing more, nothing less.  We never see any sort of compassion from him, even during the final scenes, the only hints of character development we see are when he fights alongside Deku.  Anyways, i'm rambling too much, let's move on to the final verdict.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\r\nMy Hero Academia may come off as cliche for a lot of viewers.  The story is nothing we haven't seen before, and in an era when superhero-related media is extremely common, this anime may come off as just another attempt at attracting people into the anime/otaku community.  However, I can't say that My Hero Academia was terrible, either.  I liked most of the characters to an extent, the soundtrack was solid, the art-style appealed to the anime, and the story is fairly solid.  Overall, I enjoyed this anime all the way through despite it's hit or miss characters, and with the second season coming soon, I have no doubt in my mind that this anime will have a nice and comfy spot on my anime shelf.\\n\\n\r\nMy Hero Academia gets an A-.",

This is not your normal cliche superhero anime. I was actually surprised when i found out Midoriya did not have a quirk. Unlike other anime, the main character doesn't have much of a bravado and isn't very confident. I relate to him in a metaphorical way because there are so many people with talent and probably a lot more without. The story of Midoriya shows perseverance and striving for the best. You can reallytell the creator also spent much time on the characters because they are all different and not cliche in any way. I also really like this anime because it follows the manga closely and isn't that different from the manga. I enjoyed watching the characters grow. The art, animation and voice acting is also very good. I could believe that they actually felt these things, and you can actually see the fighting scenes. The action isn't just a blur of lines and smudges and the artists pays much attention to detail. Overall I would definitely recommend this stellar anime to a friend.",

            "content": "If you haven\u2019t heard of Boku no Hero Academia already, either you live under a rock or everyone else lives on a different planet. It\u2019s hard not to hear fans of the manga hyping up this series before it even started. And even before release, it was considered to be the next big thing for the western population. Now whether or not the anime succeeding in doing so is up to you. There was a lot of things in Boku no Hero Academia\u2019s favor. It\u2019s based off of a high-selling Shounen Jump manga, it had studio Bones working on the adaptation, and the manga isconsidered to be one of the best battle shounen manga out there. In short, there were little chances of mess ups. And luckily, Bones didn\u2019t mess up at all.\\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nOkay, I\u2019m not going to tell you that Boku no Hero Academia has a creative and inventive premise, because it doesn\u2019t at all. Actually, this is the most clich\u00e9 a battle shounen anime could ever be. The setting takes place in an alternate world where people manifest supernatural powers know as quirks. Only 20% of the population ends up without a quirk. Our protagonist, Midoriya Izuku, falls in that 20%. Midoriya, a superhero fanboy, who always wants to be a hero is the one without the chance of being one. One day after certain situations happened, the greatest superhero gave him the opportunity to manifest his quirk and become a hero. The whole series revolves around Midoriya and his journey in a superhero high school. Sounds original? Of course not! But where Boku no Hero Academia shines isn\u2019t in its premise, but rather its execution. It\u2019s hard to describe what it is that makes this series enjoyable to watch. The characters are just so well done, despite its tropes, and they\u2019re easily relatable. The series goes through some really interesting situations the revolves around its characters. And the series ends on a high note due to an action-based arc. The only problem is that the series doesn\u2019t cover much, therefore it doesn\u2019t get the opportunity to showcase its biggest talent \u2013 when the series tackles darker themes. But there\u2019s always a second season!\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nDespite its clich\u00e9 premise, what makes Boku no Hero Academia so good is its execution. The series is filled with heart. It only takes two episodes to show that the series has an emotional touch to it. And the series manages to tackle some pretty important themes, such as bullying, what media portrays, and what decides the good and evil. Boku no Hero Academia is an excellent underdog story. But the series isn\u2019t just about Midoriya, but it\u2019s also about his friends, his rivals, his mentors, and his opponents. Boku no Hero Academia is a story about everyone, and how everyone makes one, which is a nice contrast to Midoriya\u2019s quirk \u201cOne for All\u201d. The series is primarily arc based, and this format works well for this series, and every other shounen anime. The biggest problem with Boku no Hero Academia is its pacing. It\u2019s quite slow for a shounen anime with a 13-episode first season. In its 13 episodes, the series only manages to adapt a little over 20 chapters. So the average pacing is less than two chapter per episode. It may be a slow adaptation, but it\u2019s a loyal one too. Nothing from the manga is skipped, and the tiny, anime-original moments are top notch (for example, a fight was extended to be twice as long in the second last episode). True dedication was put into this series.\\n\r\nPresentation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nThe best thing about Boku no Hero Academia is it characters \u2013 they\u2019re marvelous. What seemed like clich\u00e9s on paper, turned out to be three-dimensional in reality. Every character is special in every way, no matter how minor they are. As you can see from the key visuals that the cast in Boku no Hero Academia is humongous. Our protagonist, Midoriya Izuku, is one of the best shounen protagonist you\u2019ll ever see. Yes, he may be too much of a geeky fanboy at times. Yes, he might be a crybaby at times. Yes, he doesn\u2019t deserve his powers. Yes, he\u2019s not flashy like every other shounen main character. But what makes him so good is that he\u2019s filled with heart. Nicknamed as Deku, Midoriya\u2019s Deku means to never give up (according to him), and that suits him. Even after having no hope, he still never gave up. And his reward came to him. And he\u2019s not the only star of the show. His mentor, All Might, is a fascinating character. What seems like perfection in front of the world, turns out to be imperfect in reality. All Might\u2019s a great representation of what eyes can deceive. His imperfectness is what makes him human, and what makes him a good character too. Bakugou Katsuki, who started off as the clich\u00e9 bully for Midoriya, ended up being, well, still the same. But Bakugou never feels irritating, despite his attitude. He\u2019s both badass and (unintentionally) funny enough to be a great character. Next we have Midoriya\u2019s love interest, Uraraka Ochako, who ends up being a loveable character despite her clich\u00e9 characteristics. And she\u2019s really funny too. And then we have Iida Tenya, who gives you more Genos vibes than anything (and what a coincidence that his seiyuu is the same as Genos\u2019s). And he too is really likeable and understandable. We do meet the antagonists of this series, but not much has been done to develop them, though that\u2019ll be saved for the later seasons.\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nAs you can see from the key visuals, Boku no Hero Academia has quite a unique, yet pretty, art style. Colors are more deeper and outlines are more thicker, and all of this looks great. Considering the fact that it\u2019s Bones behind this anime, it\u2019s not a faraway guess if you predict that the series will have good art. Thr backgrounds look amazing and it\u2019s really pretty to look at. The art style is much more cartoonish compared to most anime, yet the series manages to look prettier. And the amount of detailing given to architectures and backgrounds are amazing. The art style resembles an American cartoon or comic, which matches its whole superhero concept. And the character designs are also fantastic. The characters look younger than other anime characters of the same age, because Boku no Hero Academia takes a more realistic approach in character proportion. And some of the superhero costume designs are absolutely phenomenal. Just look at Bakugou and Iida\u2019s costume \u2013 they look incredible. \\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nBones not only delivers in the art aspect of Boku no Hero Academia, but also the animation aspect too. For most of the series, the animation quality is consistent and fluid and there\u2019s never any noticeable hiccup. The character animations are fluid, the background animations are lively and the lighting animations look great too. There are moments in the series where the animation quality takes a sudden jump. These moments are absolutely beautiful to watch and can challenge One Punch Man quality (and that says a lot). The two most beautifully animated moments from Spring 2016 comes from Boku no Hero Academia (a small-scale fight in episode 7 and a large-scale fight in episode 12). The fight in episode 12 in particular was amazing. The cinematography, the fluidity, all felt amazing. Rarely do I ever watch a fight 10 times back-to-back.\\n\r\nAnimation: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe voice acting in Boku no Hero Academia is also very good, with some very good standout voices. Yamashita Daiki does a very good job as Midoriya. He does the zealous part and the emotionally moved part of him amazingly, while at the same time he manages to do the strategic and calm part of his character too. Miyake Kenta does a perfect job as All Might, as he captures his strength and weakness perfectly. It\u2019s surprising how he was able to make one voice match both All Might personas. Okamoto Nobuhiko is probably the best choice for Bakugou. He does his aggressive and egotistical character with ease. There\u2019s absolutely no complaints about his casting. Ishikawa Kaito coincidently got to play as another character that follows the rules and is righteous. He does Iida excellently. Sakura Ayane does an okay job as Uraraka. It doesn\u2019t stand out as much as the other seiyuu work in this series, but it works. And Kaji Yuki is surprisingly a good fit for Todoroki. I expect great things from him in the next season. And the rest of the supporting seiyuu do a good job too. Boku no Hero Academia already has a dub going on, so you can check that out too if you want. From the couple episodes I\u2019ve heard from the English dub, it\u2019s pretty average, nothing too special. Some miscasting is present though.\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThere\u2019s only one word that can describe the music in Boku no Hero Academia: godly. Considering the fact that we have Haikyuu\u2019s music composer, one can expect some good music in the series. There\u2019s just so many memorable background music from this series. The rap music that is played throughout some moments in the series, such as Midoriya\u2019s training montage, is absolutely addicting and cool to listen too. It really gets you pumped up. The main background theme used (the one used in the previews) is also really good too. But my personal favorite background music has to be the theme for the villains. When they appear, and when that track starts, you know sh*t\u2019s about to hit the fan really hard. The OP and ED in the series is extremely good too. The OP, \u201cThe Day\u201d, is absolutely fantastic and enthralling. The music is great and the vocals are exciting. The verse before the chorus always gets me, and the chorus exists to hype up the upcoming episode. The ED, \u201cHEROES\u201d, is a very good song that has both good music and vocals that complement each other. And it adds to the emotional aspect of Boku no Hero Academia.\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nIf it wasn\u2019t obvious by now, yes, I loved Boku no Hero Academia a lot. Maybe I like it more than I should, may you like it less then you are, but Boku no Hero Academia is something fresh in the shounen genre, despite not looking like so in the initial looks. The series is filled with heart and emotional impact and the serie manages to tackle some really important themes. And the characters are so enjoyable. Not a single one of them end up being underdeveloped. And the art and animations are fantastic. Though I would have enjoyed this series a little more if the pacing was a lot faster, since it\u2019s quite slow in comparison to its fast-paced manga. But other than that, this is one hell of a ride. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nBoku no Hero Academia is an absolute must watch for those who are fans of the genre. If you like superhero or battle shounen anime and you haven\u2019t tried out this anime yet, you\u2019re wasting your time. And for those who aren\u2019t fans of the genres, you should still try it out. It\u2019s not the most original anime out there, but the execution makes up for it. It\u2019s got a great cast of characters and the main plot and world building is great. And Bones delivers with their amazing art and animation. Add in some kickass background music and some solid voice acting, you\u2019ve got yourself a solid anime. It takes time for it to get to the good part, and this season didn\u2019t even adapt the best parts of the manga yet, but still this series manages to exceed expectations and be better than almost all the anime from this season. Boku no Hero Academia is an anime that lives up to its expectations and can prove to be a big franchise in the future.\\n\\n\r\n+ Proves that solid execution can make a generic script into a unique one\\n\r\n+ Fantastic characters, which each of them being special in their own way\\n\r\n+ Fantastic action sequences, boasted by great art and animations\\n\r\n+ Great underdog story with a spectacular final arc, which warms up the second season \\n\r\n+ Outstanding background music complements the content\\n\r\n- Pacing can be too slow at times\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.1/10",

            "content": "Going to keep this short and sweet. This show starts off brilliantly, and its world-building is top notch. You can quickly pick up on what the structure of society is all about, and slowly learn of its nuances. \r\nThe characters are solidly placed into this world of quirks, and all that that entails, and can relate to this struggle. Our hero, Midoriya, is a young \"quirkless,\" or power-less man, struggling to find his place in a society of heroes and villains. There's something in that concept that could be extrapolated, fleshed out, and really taken advantage of, but they never do. \r\nIt wouldn't be atypical shounen cash cow if the primary antagonist didn't go through some sort of struggle, followed by an insane power-creep, would it?\\n\\n\r\nFilled to the brim with tropes and predictable ho-hum, this show very swiftly discards its compelling attributes, and replaces it with a Bleach-esque power struggle that tries its hardest to undermine its own potential brilliance. It feels as if you watched an amalgam of every stereotypical shounen by the end, and maybe that's what people want.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is brilliantly done, and you can tell the budget was very high for a first season. The smoothness of a notable fight near the end of the season is a testament to the skill of the studio. Liquid smooth and oozing with style, it's hard not to enjoy what's on the screen, and its a wonderful way to cap an otherwise somewhat boring show. Though this is always typically done in anime, the execution lies within the creators' talents, and they were not found wanting.\\n\\n\r\nBut again, its predictable. And maybe this is what people want. Predictability. Safety. Thoughtlessness. Sure, its easy to watch, but what is the cost? Just watch HxH, it's essentially the same story but told better, and with more interesting characters.",

            "content": "TL;DR below.\r\nStory 10/10\r\nMidoriya Izuku was just a regular middle school student in a world where people with superpowers known as Quirks are the norm. However, he dreams of one day becoming a Hero, despite being bullied by his classmates for not having a Quirk. After being the only one to try and save his childhood friend, Katsuki, from a Villain, All Might, the world's greatest Hero, bestows upon him his own quirk, One For All. The story follows Izuku's entrance into Yuuei High School, a school that cultivates the next generation of Heroes.\r\nDespite being a highly generic shounen anime, it was surprisingly better than expected.The anime draws clear boundaries and balances out every super hero, other than All Might whom is clearly a few tiers higher than the rest, everyone else is pretty balanced.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention the villains, having a ultra strong super hero, All Might and his disciple Midoriya, we also have a super strong super villain, All for one and his disciple Shigaraki.\\n\\n\r\nAll preparing for the ultimate face-off between the two strongest quirks.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWe start off seeing the wimpy Midoriya, not able to achieve anything but if you were thinking you'd see a replica of Naruto, you though wrong. Midoriya had the Naruto personality that's for sure but after meeting All Might, he began to gain confidence, still wimpy but definitely much better off.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, well I'll leave it to you to find out!\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime  doesn't particularly have very fancy visuals or charismatic tone. However, what I like about it is because it is plain. Plain but vibrant too!\\n\\n\r\nThe art allows us to focus more on the story and all the characters better because we won't get captivated by the visuals of the characters so that is definitely an ULTRA PLUS point for the show!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really love the sounds made by the different powers and also, the art style of certain characters also suit the voice acting perfectly! \\n\r\nTake Shoto Todoroki for example, his voice is acted by none other than Yuki, Kaji and suits him perfectly!\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR (Overall) 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're wanting to watch an action-filled comedy anime, Boku No Hero really packs a *Smash*\\n\\n",

            "content": "I hope no one takes any offence since its my personal view on BNHA...So now lets get to the review!May contain spoilers but nothing so important.Any suggestions are appreciated.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nThe story was pretty ordinary nothing out of the blue.It was a typical shonen story about a powerless guy becoming powerful.Sure there were some twists and turns here and there but for the most part it was predictable.Plus this was a short series so one cannot expect a lot of content.To put it in simple terms the story was basically Hero Vs Villain.Duh!?\r\nArt 9/10\r\nStudio Bones did a great job with the artwork.If there was one thingwhich covered for the lack of a solid story it was artwork.The action scenes were well planned and properly designed..So props to them.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was good.It pushed you to the edge of the seat and kept you hooked.But there weren't many soundtracks.Still the select few were good enough to keep  you excited till the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10\\n\r\nThere were many characters.But Izuku and All Might ate up most of the screen time in what was a short series.Plus hyping up the main character for whatever he did was annoying.I dint really like the main character.He was crying for most of the time xD. There were some interesting characters never-the less which made you watch the show.Plus poor villains.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nI think for the first timers this show would have provided so much enjoyment but for those who have seen Naruto,DBZ,One piece,HxH etc,. NOT much.The predictable story dint make me impatient for the next week's episode.Example: The strongest hero is yet to arrive and the main character is about to get killed.What happens?\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nI dint feel any emotional connection with the characters or the series which was the biggest drawback.But if you are looking to kill some time this is a good show to watch.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully the second season gets better.",

            "content": "At first, I wanted to post a review from the first 3 episodes but since I haven't read the manga I decided to hold my urge until the end of the series.\r\nThe only thing someone really needs to know before he/she starts watching the series is that it's a typical shounen with all the typical characteristics a shounen has. It has a wimpy, whiny but bold protagonist who is recognized and gets laughed at the same time, mostly for his courage. It has incredibly strong and caring characters who serve as role models for everyone (especially to our protagonist). And it has extremely evil, ruthlessand \"terrifying\" villains.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are someone who's seen this a thousand times before and you're sick of watching the same formula over and over again, then this show is NOT for you.\\n\\n\r\nIf you, on the other hand, are someone who's seen this a thousand times before and you can't get enough of it then this show is one you will definitely enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nStory (7)\\n\r\nThese first 13 episodes are just an introduction, as the show itself says so repeatedly at the end including an announcement of a 2nd season (and a 3rd season after that, I'm sure). So know that there's still a lot of ground left to cover.\\n\\n\r\nHere you'll see the early days of Midoriya before and after he enters UA High School and watch him gain the attraction of friends and foes alike due to his overwhelming amount of potential.\\n\\n\r\nThe show did a great job of keeping me coming back after each episode to see what Midoriya will pull off next. (literally!) The fight scenes were extremely pleasant -well choreographed and thought out-. Although there wasn't too much detail put in the overall scenario.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound (9 | 10)\\n\r\nThe atmosphere in the show sound-wise is very well done. For a super hero series, the soundtracks before a fight put you in the mood for some action and as they progress into the fight they can really make you sit at the edge of your seat. The sound effects are also very appropriate for action (punch, dash, super powers, high jumps etc.)\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to art... well, Bones know how to do their job. A lot of fans from the manga have said they're doing the series a favor with such high quality animation. Attention to detail and a bright color palette make watching the show a treat to the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6)\\n\r\nNot much to say here. As I said, you got a weak protagonist in strenght and character but with huge potential (Midoriya). A cute and caring female who's a close friend to Midoriya. An oversensitive, resentful rival who's angry at Midoriya all the time for no particular reason. And a bunch of other more or less emotional characters (depending on their strenght) to whom the show doesn't focus on very much probably because it wants to showcase Midoriyas struggle.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10) | Overall (8)\\n\r\nAs you can see the show has its weaknesses, of course. So it's in the viewer's hands to either forgive or condemn these flaws. Personally, I forgive them. Just because I believe the positives outvalue the negatives. For someone else, it might be the complete opposite. As I said in the beginning of this review, it really depends if you want to sit and watch another stereotypical shounen. And if you want to, then this might be one of the best shounen you've seen so far.",

            "content": "Boku no hero academia has some low maturity if you're interested in a mature anime. But the fascinating story and the fun characters makes up for it. The story(not going to spoil that much) has an awesome concept basically saying that most of the population in the world has now superpowers and has now become a normal thing. The interesting part is that we are taken along with the story of a teenager who has no superpowers or quirks(as referred in the anime) and see him trying to become a hero. The story as goes with him, takes a massive twist changing his life(in agood way) but not his good ideology of \"what a hero is and should do\" which is sort of shown as a property not many heros have in the anime(I guess) due to which this massive twist occurred. The anime goes on showing Izuku(the teenager) with his going to a hero school(as the title \"academia\" suggests) to become a hero(now due to that \"twist\", the world's no.1 hero).This anime goes on with Izuku's sense of heroism to shine.The ideology of hero(not only of Izuku's but others too)is reflected a lot in this anime. There is so much to the story I haven't told,or it will get spoilt. As a superhero anime, it has some cool action scenes and overall, a story of determination and heroism(also has some funny scenes).",

            "content": "As we know Boku no Hero Academia is the brand new shounen anime Which is being produced by Shounen Jump currently . It started airing on 2016 and season 1 had 12 episodes. Currently it is at season 2 ep 4/24 and manga is at chapter 136. (Potential SPOILERS ahead )\r\nWell let me summarize the story. In the super human society where the MC lives .. every human have a super power called quirks which comes in different forms, like quirk to control fire , become invisible.. in a word super power. Now due to that to maintain law and order a new government professioncame to existence i.e Hero's. In that society people strive to be the best hero. Among all the Heroes All Might is no 1 and The Symbol of Peace. Now our young Midorya Izunuku wants to become the no 1 hero. But unfortunately he turns out to be quirk less ...that is until he met All Might. Despite being powerless and teased he strives to be a hero and didn't think twice before saving anyone. Such quality impressed All Might and so Midorya became the Successor for One for All. And he joins U.A the best hero school and the story begins .. it's the story of how he became the world's no 1 hero.\\n\r\nSo now let's get to the point why it is the best to me by discussing the Quality of anime\\n\r\n1. Story :It has a good story. Well a good story is always required for a better anime. Example Naruto. It has one of the best stories ever. Well BNH might not have stories like Naruto but still its good enough to get 8/10. Not to mention arcs aren't messed up .\\n\r\n2. Characters: Its one of the most important part of Anime. In this anime the Author focused a lot on each and every characters. Example even after making Deku powerless he was smart and a good strategist despite acting like a stupid some times. We know that Bukago is a hot head but despite the fact He knows what he must do in times ( watch BNH jump festa ep) and he has respect for his opponent .. well you will get the best example of that in Bukago vs Uraraka battle. Then there is Todoroki with family problems and Yuyuroza, Ida .. each and every character have some problems like Ida's brother being ***** by hero killer , Todoroki refusal to use fire , Deku's and Bukago's big misunderstanding (read Kacchan vs Deku manga chapter to understand ). The Author also put a lot of work in Side characters for best example we can see it in the red riots debut manga chapter (134),side characters character and personality development is also shown . In a way the character creations , dealing with side characters have been done very well. Not too many Shounen anime did this. Yes Naruto had this but not to forget those were in filler episodes ,DBZ web we can see how well the Handel Yamacha .. Well FT is a mentionable anime which handled side characters well. Remember Mystagon from FT. One piece is also worth mention in here. In this manga parents and adults also have a major role. Not many shounen does it . It most shounen you will find carefree parents or like in HxH missing parents. But this anime does an extraordinary job in this sector.\\n\r\n3.Animation and Art style : I don't think I have to explain this part .. right ? Well since its 2016 anime it have a better animation style then most other shounen anime.\\n\r\n4. Plot twists : This is a very vital factor that makes an anime very interesting . An anime without plot twist is very predictable and boring. This story have a lot of amazing plot twist. , like How Team Midorya won in round 2 , Nomus appearance and identity , Hero killer , Todoroki using fire again , Deku vs Kacchan , All for One.. the biggest plot twists are Night eyes vision about all might and Identity of the Leader of league of villains. The story contains major plot twists that makes it impossible to predict what's gonna happen next . I am not gonna mention the plot twists of Hero Provisional License Arc. Naruto and Bleach had a lot of Plot twists too. Gintama is also an anime with huge plot twists. Not to mention FT that loves trolling.(shitty trolls)\\n\r\n5. Story development : Yes it is a vital . Naruto was a hit due to its story development. The depth and darkness of a story is also important .HxH have a deep and awesome story development which made it a master piece . In BNH the stories gets more darker and more deeper as well as me mysteries are discovered with each arc. That's why it has one of the best story development.\\n\r\n6. Overpowered Characters : Every anime have at list one over powered character . In BNH there are a lot of them. But the writer handled them well. The more strong a character is the more limit he has. Example All Might's time limit , Mydoria's body and his Arm , Todoroki's body temperature problem , the lightning kids mental breakdown problem , laser kids stomach ace , Uraraka's weight limit , Asyu's organ problem .... and so on. The anime ensured power , limiter and a way to overcome it for every characters of story. That's the main reason we love it. Yes there are still overpowered villains like All for One but he can be defeat by One For All holder. The story doesn't have ridiculously over powered character ...not like DBS and SAO at least .\\n\r\n7. VILLEINS : Yes . They are important. BNHA have made pretty interesting and mysterious villeins making it a interesting story. It have overpowered , strong , cunning , intelligent villeins as well as shitty fathers like Overhaul. At least they made dark and pure evil VILLEINS not some shitty villeins like DBS (with a few exceptions)\\n\r\nSince the Anime handled the above characters well I think its the best. Not to mention the epic fight scene and animation.",

            "content": "Story: 7/10. If you ever watched the movie Sky-High, then you basically get the premise of MHA. \r\n- World where people have special powers and can be real-life superheroes? Check.\r\n- Main character who lacks special powers despite wanting to be a hero? Check.\r\n- Really obnoxious 'rival' who hates the main character and has the power to blow up stuff? Check.\r\nThe plot of this show is fundamentally simple, and I think that works both as a strength and as a vice. Because of the simplicity, you aren't hung up on convoluted details; for a battle shounen, this works fantastically because the show becomes fast-paced, engaging anddynamic. However, due to this we don't really feel much connection to the characters and aren't necessarily attached to the stories of the current arcs. After watching the show twice, nothing really stood out to me besides the fights and 'epic moments'; the character interactions are pretty forgettable in this season. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10. Really great, not much to be said here. Bones knows what they're doing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10. Love the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10. Pretty simplistic, which isn't a bad thing but isn't necessarily great either. Most character motivations are pretty one-dimensional. We don't really see any growth from anyone, but given this is Season 1 and there are multiple seasons of this show, it's to be expected.\\n\\n\r\nAll Might is a 10/10 though.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10. I had a blast watching this show, and I think it's an easy one for people to get into: whether you're a hard core anime fan or something who just wants to watch something for fun. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10. MHA is one of the few shows that finds strength in simplicity. It's cliched, somewhat generic and not particularly revolutionary, but it executes its story in an entertaining way and keeps you wanting to see more.",

            "content": "Contains spoilers (not super-specific ones, but general, non-specific parts of the story)\r\nOriginality is often overrated. It can be mind-blowing, groundbreaking, and even thought-provoking when it's done well, but I've seen many anime (or works in any creative medium for that matter) that present an interesting premise only to become something dull and unengaging because the execution and/or development of the unique ideas was poor. A super unique and original show simply cannot be good or better without high quality execution of its ideas, story, and concepts. My Hero Academia, however, is proof that standard fare can be very enjoyable and pretty damn good when it'swell-executed.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10-Good\\n\r\nIt's hard to imagine a much more conventional set-up for a superhero story than the one My Hero Academia presents us. To keep the summary brief and spoilers minimal, I'll just say that we have a down-on-his-luck MC who fatefully ends up receiving some mentoring from a famous hero whom he's idolized since childhood, works/trains hard, makes some friends, and makes some notable contributions to the final confrontation (of season 1) with some villains. It's a pretty typical story, but it's well-told and I was consistently engaged throughout the show's run-time. There are some good, entertaining battles to be seen in MHA that develop the characters further as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7.5/10-Great\\n\r\nThe animation fits the show's tone and superhero theme perfectly. I haven't read the manga (yet) but from the images I've seen from it, it looks like the animators' intentions was to maintain the comic book aesthetic and they did a great job.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.5/10-Excellent\\n\r\nThe value of an excellent soundtrack (and OP/ED) in an anime is often understated. My Hero Academia's OP was awesome and consistently got me hyped to watch each episode. The ED is pretty good as well and the OST is well-utilized in keeping the viewer engaged in the action and story of MHA.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10-Excellent\\n\r\nIt's hard not to like these characters. There's a good mix of powers and personalities to be found in the bunch and it helps keep the show really entertaining. Anyone who enjoys the show is sure to find one or more characters that they really like. Character development doesn't occur in the most unique ways, but it's enjoyable seeing everyone mature and grow stronger together, and that's what these types of shows (shounen/superheroes) are all about. I personally like Uraraka and All Might the best.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10-Excellent\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5/10-Great\\n\r\nI've only seen season 1 and while I wouldn't put My Hero Academia among my absolute favorites at this time, I really liked it and I definitely plan on watching seasons 2 and 3. If you like shounen, action, or superhero anime, I can strongly recommend that you watch My Hero Academia. If you're in the mood for something really different and unconventional, you may want to skip it for now though. If you're neutral about both of my previous statements, I'd say you should still give it a try as it's a great show in my opinion. The action, story, and characters are sure to hold most viewers' attention and keep them entertained. My Hero Academia strives to tell an enjoyable, good ol' fashioned superhero story and it does just that.",

If anyone still hasn't given this show a try they don't know what they are missing. This review may contain small spoilers.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nThe story is a typical shounen one. Main character struggles to become a hero even though he doesn't have super powers (or quirks as they call them here), while almost everyone around him has them. The hero he idolises gives him a quirk but he has to learn to control it. We follow him through his jurney of becoming a hero. While the storyis simple and stereotypical, it's written in a really good way and there are very few plot holes involved.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFluid animation and consisten art style.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nGreat opening and ending themes. The tunes fit perfectly over the scenes and emphasise the right feel of the moment.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\\n\r\nVery good character introduction, but slow developement. Some characters may appear as too one-dimentional in terms of character. This is however, well resolved in the following seasons. If we take them in account, overall character developement would be 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAction packed scenes and quality commedy keep you wanting to watch more. Great balance between serious and comical moments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best shounen out there and I belive everyone should give this one a try. If the first season doesn't do it for you, the second and third one will, I assure you 100%.",

            "content": "My opinion is rather mixed. My Hero Academia is a clich\u00e9 storm of a shonen and most of what I've seen in it felt like deja-vu, so the first half of season 1 was pretty boring. But to be honest it isn't bad, I don't have any \"X is shit\" comment about it. I think if I watched it 10+ years ago when I was younger and had watched less anime, I would have adored it because the whole clich\u00e9 things would have felt new to me. Basically I think for people new to anime (not just younger audiences) it should be great, but waskinda bland to me.\\n\\n\r\nIt gets better in the second half of season 1 (USJ arc) though so I think it was a good thing that I continued watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style and animation and music (including OP/ED songs) are great so that's a plus. All Might is a very particular and original character and I've liked him a lot. Izuku/Deku/Midoriya (main character) was kind of annoying at first because he was whiny although it is kind of justified in context.\\n\\n\r\nBakugo (the rival) was kind of crappy and lame because he was so unlikable and a clich\u00e9 bully but he gets a bit better over time so he's not a lost cause. Basically I think he's supposed to be the more violent aggressive hero but he comes off as very arrogant and sometime borderline psychopathic.\\n\\n\r\nThe only shit part that I really didn't like and would wish out of existence is the rat bitch (I don't know his name). He has no redeeming qualities, no heroism and no composure, panics at the slightest hint of danger and is useless in any situation. Worst part is that he's a creep that physically abuse his female classmates by touching their butts and boobs. I found him incredibly creepy and disgusting and unnecessary and he made me uncomfortable. Having a character wear a sexually revealing costume is ok for fanservice, a somewhat lovable perv too but a damn creep is not. Also his power is throwing his hair which is shaped like balls and they're sticky. All of these combined made me question why he was even there, in UA the most prestigious school and A-1 the best class of the school? And the teacher said he once expelled an entire class because they lacked potential? He also had better scores than Deku in physical tests despite having a useless quirk and being a chubby midget? How is he not getting expelled? Just so he can sexually harass his classmates? Get out of here :/",

            "content": "English:\r\nWell, this is my first opinion. Although I have seen many animes and mangas to date, but recently started in all this Myanimelist, try to be as impartial and objective about this anime. OK lets start.\r\n\"Boku no hero Acedemia\" does not present the story of a little boy \"Deku\" who dreams of being a superhero in a world where every person has some quality that vulve \"special\" and used to try to help others and preserve peace, although some not so much ... the anime presents a story that anyone would say: \"I have already seen this somewhere else\" but still has a touch oforiginality, entering a nice touch of comedy and drama the precise moments, a loaded anime a very good animation, design aceptabl characters, soundtrack, etc. each chapter has its \"uniqueness\" that makes you stay until the end of the series, on the other hand what most captive of this story is its strange and sympathetic characters, fairly well developed by the author and play an important role in the history. The anime is loaded with nostalgic moments that one more would make out a good pair of tears (I include myself in this XD). Boku no hero academy is one of those animes Encourage you to see the initial work (Manga), if you have not seen, I say this from experience. of course there are lots of things we could talk concerning\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEspa\u00f1ol:\\n\\n\\n\r\nbien, este es mi primera opini\u00f3n. Aunque he visto muchos animes y mangas hasta la fecha, pero reci\u00e9n comienzo en todo esto de Myanimelist, tratare de ser lo mas imparcial y objetivo en cuanto a este anime. bien, comencemos.\\n\\n\r\n\"Boku no hero acedemia\" no presenta la historia de un peque\u00f1o chico \"Deku\" que sue\u00f1a con ser un superheroe en un mundo donde cada persona tiene alguna cualidad que lo vuelve \"especial\" y usan para tratar de ayudar a los dem\u00e1s y preservar la paz, aunque algunos no tanto... el anime nos presenta una historia en la que cualquiera dir\u00eda: \"esto ya lo he visto en alg\u00fan otro lado\" pero aun as\u00ed tiene su toque de originalidad, introduciendo un buen toque de comedia, acci\u00f3n y drama en los momentos precisos, un anime cargado de una muy buena animaci\u00f3n, dise\u00f1o de personajes aceptable, soundtrack, etc. cada capitulo tiene su \"peculiaridad\" que te hace mantenerte hasta el fin de la serie, por otro lado lo que mas cautiva de esta historia es sus extra\u00f1os y simp\u00e1ticos personajes, bastante bien elaborados por el autor y que juegan un rol importante dentro de la historia. El anime esta cargado de momentos nost\u00e1lgicos que a mas de uno har\u00eda salir un buen par de lagrimas (en esto me incluyo XD). Boku no hero academia es de esos animes que te animan al ver el trabajo inicial (Manga), si aun no lo has visto,  esto lo digo por experiencia. por supuesto hay much\u00edsimas cosas de las que podr\u00eda hablar referente a este anime, pero es mejor causar curiosidad a los posibles espectadores... sin mas nada que decir, es una obra que sin duda recomendar\u00eda...\\n\r\nUn fuerte abrazo y saludos a los que se interesen en esta opini\u00f3n.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNOTA: A la espera de la segunda temporada!! :)",

            "content": "In the Legend Of Zelda universe, there exists a item called the Deku Nut, a small nuciform item that blinds all enemies when thrown at the ground. Similarly, Deku from Boku No Hero Academia is small, yet packs a shockingly strong punch. This anime is nuts.\r\nThe premise of this show is that in a world where the vast majority of all humans have some kind of superpower of varying strength and degree. They can range from mundane bonuses to everyday life, such as being able to attract small objects, to the ability to change the weather with a single punch, which we have totally neverseen before. The way that a person's Quirk is decided is from the quirks of their respective parents; a fire-breather hitting the shack with someone who can turn enlarge their hands would make someone who can make their hands burn or something. Our main character, Midoriya Izuku, who we will refer to as 'Deku' because it's shorter, is one of the few humans who are completely, terribly, normal. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike the Zelda franchise, let's start with some negative points. The impracticality of some powers among Deku's classmates, such as one girl which can turn invisible (when she was a baby how could parents find her? How is she not the most obviously overpowered person in the show) and another character of minor importance; someone who wears a spacesuit when not in space known as 13-go. He can make black holes, but apparently, the gravity has grown stronger over time seeing as black holes now function like defective vacuum cleaners. All Might should in no way be considered to be the strongest hero; being invisible is the simplest way to stick a knife in someone from behind. Also, I distinctly remember one person who was literally a warp gate. Being able to teleport only half of a person, effectively cutting the target in half, why didn\u2019t he kill all the students, instead choosing to scatter them all over the map/play structure/training field? Also, a fundamental problem with this anime\u2019s world; if two parents with weak quirks yield one quirkless child and the majority of the quirk users have weak quirks, doesn\u2019t that mean that the quirkless demographic should be a lot larger than 20%? In fact, they should be dying in droves every generation. But then again, the point of this anime isn\u2019t exactly worldbuilding but they still do a good job anyway.\\n\\n\r\nI know it\u2019s going to sound cheesy, but I felt like this was genuinely moved me. In a genre revolving around teenage boys yelling while screaming the name of their attacks and minute-long scenes with the same frame, Boku no Hero Academia does...well, the same thing, but better. The first two episodes are set up around Deku\u2019s hopeless dream of becoming a hero despite being completely average. In the first few episodes we get most of the character development, which I especially liked. Deku gets attacked, gets saved by his hero and idol All Might, only to realize his manmade god, his marble pillar was actually cracked on the inside. All Might is only able to maintain his superhero form for a limited time, turning into a seedy looking American the rest of the day. Deku witnesses firsthand All Might\u2019s internal conflict, and how the smile on his face was just as much for himself as for everyone looking All Might\u2019s existence serves to reinforce the idea that \u2018even the most perfect people are still human\u2019. The arbitrary time limit is a metaphor for impermanence and evanescence of human power and established legends; the backbone of his power is, after all, something to be inherited. Deku himself is no stranger either to crushing reality, going through depression at the age of six.  , seeing this, shows the audience his dedication in a beautiful scene with the sunset in slow motion and All Might\u2019s retreating figure. He went through more of a development arc in two episodes than most shounen protagonists go through in two hundred. All of this painted a picture which imprints on the viewer\u2019s mind a sense of childish nostalgia versus grim reality, which was a powerful image even though the premise for all this was All Might apparently deflating during surgery (?).\\n\\n\r\nAfter the highly above-average initial episodes, the story kind of devolves into a normal shounen . The fights were epic though. eh. Take a 9.\\n\\n\r\nIf only on a basis of the first few episodes, Boku No Hero Academia connects with the audience in a personal trip exploring a child\u2019s journey of adoration and disappointment, one every human regardless of race, creed, or quirk has suffered. \\n\r\nMy Hero Academia is not called The Hero Academia, or Deku\u2019s Hero Academia, because in it we get a sense of personality that one can only call their own.",

            "content": "This is perhaps the most conventional of the new unconventional shonen  series; future installments may well change the score for this young series, but not what it is. On one hand the contrived plots, runaway power up and awkward comedy of other shonen titles is absent. So the journey from zero to hero, the great shonen story, is real and deadly serious as Naruto's never was. The real anguish of power level 0, the competition from a world of top-tier heroes, not a sole flamboyant rival, and the vomit-inducing, bone-shattering labour, renewed at every stage of the series, make this definitely the series biggeststrength. The aforementioned rival is a decent character, likewise the over-serious friend and love interest. The teacher-student relationship is perhaps stronger, thought not yet more poignant,  than Assassination Classroom. Not a single fight scene yet is boring; many are simply electrifying.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this series is still shonen. Hard work and courage are the powers to conquer the world; characters look set to develop more in their powers than their personalities. The villainous characters particularly can be pegged as lightweights straight away. Character motivations and the plot they determine exactly (a break with reality in itself) seem simplistic and already set in stone. Character relationships and animation, though certainly good, seem particularly conventional compared to Mob Psycho 100. The superhero satire isn't so good as One Punch Man (Mumen Rider beats MHA, even its the only thing he can 'beat' ahaha). Worldbuilding is sketchy, and, with everything else, streets behind Fullmetal Alchemist. But this is certainly worth following for fans of good shonen, and good adventure.\\n",

            "content": "Are you wondering why \"My Hero Academy\" was one of the most admirable anime in 2016 or what does it have to offer that considerable number of people have given a high rating for it? If your curious, please keep reading...\r\nThe story starts off simple: A  regular middle school kid, Midoriya Izuku, doesn't have superpowers (or you can call them 'Quirks') unlike other people who do and since he dreams of going to a hero academy and becoming a hero, he is unable to do so since he is 'Quirkless' (without superpowers). \r\nAnyway, the story starts in the usual way like most shounen animedo, and it carries on like that throughout the anime and so this simply means that the anime doesn't have any unique concepts to offer; the same old quirky characters and the same concept of good versus evil. Then what does this anime offer to its audience? It the familiarity that keeps us watching...\\n\\n\\n\r\nWe've seen great shows like One punch Man, Hunter X Hunter and so on. We loved the drama and the characters that these anime put up. We  alos sometimes admire anime that are similar to the ones we greatly appreciate and hence, this is why we adore 'My Hero Academy'. I've seen a countless anime that have tried to be original and unique but failed when it came to enjoyment. This could be because they were so focused on making everything, including plot twists and characters, unique that it just made the whole anime appear flat and 2-dimensional. However, this anime did not get into that and that's what unique about it. It didn't force itself to be different and that's why they were able to execute the story plot and characters well. The soundtracks are also worth noting as it made the action look fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nThe last few episodes had a great soundtrack played while jaw-dropping fights were shown. \"You say run\" is an OST that's probably the most notable OSTs I have ever heard and there are tons of youtube videos that use the OST for other anime just to prove that the catchy music goes with everything.\\n\\n\r\nIt's immensely pleasing with a roaring entertainment, nevertheless, the anime has its drawbacks. Firstly, it was quite noticeable that the anime was too fast-paced in the first few episodes that it felt meaningless. It shows that our protagonist, Izuku, trains awfully hard for ten months but for us, all that training happens in less than one episode. The training was supposed to be shown as an inspirational and encouraging move but they quickly rushed through it. I know that the directors were trying to fit the whole story in 13 eps but it shouldn't have been rushed so badly. \\n\r\nThere was another matter that made we feel like dropping it in the beginning - the first few episodes were a bit boring and i guess the reason for that was that it had a horrible scene sequencing or maybe the pacing kept differing that gave it funny feeling and made it almost intolerable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe first four to five episodes were slightly boring to me so I recommend you not to judge it in those first few episodes. If you love shounen, you will most likely appreciate the anime as it is very entertaining.\\n\\n",

It specially shines in the important moments of the anime, so it gets you hooked more and more with every chapter.\r\nIn this first season the story does not play an important role, as it is more focused on introducing all the characters and their motivations and, although the pace is really good, it lacks something. Even though, itis a good start for what is coming in 2nd season so nevermind.\\n\\n\r\nLast thing I would like to comment is the BSO, OST or whatever you want to call it. I started watching this anime without knowledge of anything about it and the one thing that shocked me the most was the soundtrack. It's simply perfect for the show, and it became one of my favourites BSO from an anime. I mean, Yuki Hayashi's works are too powerful, they get you hyped when they want (I am currently listening to one of yuki's songs as I write this review haha).\\n\\n\r\nAnd last, if I had to give a score to every part it would be:\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 10\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review will be helpful for someone that hasn't seen the show.",

This story keeps you on the edge of your seat man. \r\nArt: BEAUTIFUL!\r\nSound: Very nice!

            "content": "( `=`)/\r\nI think this anime was one of the bests for its season. It could use some work, but I think it is worth taking a look at even if there are some flaws, including consistency issues. This left me with mixed feelings about the anime.\r\nStory 7.5/10\r\nThe first few episodes of this anime were absolutely amazing (10/10). In these episodes, they did a very fine job of telling the story and developing the characters. The result: an interesting action-packed emotional roller coaster with lots of momentum. ( * - *)\r\nAfter those few episodes, the story wasn't able to keep up with its own momentum. Itseemed to slow down and become less interesting. In addition, other problems were born. Although it wasn't bad, I was still disappointed by the quality drop. When the first part of the roller coaster is better, the disappointment makes the rest of the ride feel worse than it actually is, even if it isn't that bad.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\\n\r\nMost of the main characters are pretty likable. As mentioned earlier, the character development early on was amazing, especially for the MC, Izuku. Unfortunately, Izuku's development was wasted in the latter half because he wasn't given the chance to shine. You know how the MC gets plot armor sometimes? Well this time the villains had plot armor against the MC, and it was absolute horse shit. If you could jump vertically up to skyscraper height, why couldn't you jump a few meters horizontally without slowing down \\n\r\n(9 OAO)9 ?!\\n\\n\r\nAnother character I was a bit disappointed in was Katsuki. Again, his development with the MC during the first few episodes was great. However, it seemed like they steered him in a slightly different direction than what they were building on, but that wasn't too bad. What disappointed me a lot was the fact that he also stepped on horse shit like Izuku did. If you're in a life or death situation, don't just pin the bad guy down until he screws everyone over. AT THE VERY LEAST knock him out (9 `O`)----o\\n\\n\r\nI've talked about the villains' plot armor which caused illogical events, now lets talk about the villains themselves. I was disappointed by most of the main villains. Their arc was very cliched, and you could tell that they got plot armored, aside from Nomu. The main villains were accompanied by lots of insignificant cannon fodder who were to weak to let the good guys shine as characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nComedy shonen/10\\n\\n\r\nSince this anime has a comedy tag, I'll talk about the comedy. There were some parts that were funny, but if I remember correctly, most of the comedy was cheap shonen style comedy where they derp up the characters a bit to show that it's supposed to be funny, but it's not. I guess it would be more suitable for a younger audience.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was really good. It complimented the atmosphere really well during fights and emotional moments (especially the first few episodes). There were some parts where I felt the song didn't match the atmosphere, but I don't think that happened often. I see people talk mostly or only about the OP and ED when reviewing sound. Unless the OP or ED is incorporated into the actual story, I won't use them to rate the sound. If I remember correctly, the OP sounded good though. (v `- `)b\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI'd say the art was pretty good as well. Most of the fight scenes or dramatic moments were animated well. As mentioned earlier, I didn't appreciate the chibi'ing (not sure what to call it) to show comedic moments. I probably didn't appreciate it because most of it wasn't funny. There were some parts that overused flashbacks that we already saw, which made the particular episode feel slow and boring. Other than that, things seemed good.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to take a nap now ( `=`)/",

            "content": "**This entire review is SPOILER-FREE!!**\r\nIn a nutshell, My Hero Academia/Boku no Hero Academia/HeroAca (which is what I will be calling it) tells the story of an aspiring young superhero named Izuku Midoriya a.k.a. Deku and describes his journey to becoming the world's greatest superhero, starting with enrolling in the prestigious U.A. High School, a place specifically designed to train heroes (note how there is no uncertainty in how his journey ends; the narration tells us he IS the best).\r\nFirst off, I want to express appreciation for how this show is structured in a seasonal manner. This opening entry to the series is a short, accessible13 episode run, and I think that goes a long way in inviting viewers who are a bit shy when it comes to devoting time to watching anime, particularly those who are new to anime as a whole. The alternative would be to have a 700 episode series like Naruto or an 800+/STILL AIRING show like One Piece. That isn't to say that those series are bad, but for someone who is new and wants to experience a decent Shounen superhero-genre title without episode after episode of filler, HeroAca is just that: a decent show that is fun and entertaining and also does a great job of opening up a gateway to future seasons that, so far, have proven/will prove to be better in almost every way.\\n\\n\r\nLet's now get into the nitty-gritty parts of the show and its production.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters:\\n\r\nThe \"In a nutshell\" sentence at the start of this review is really all there is in terms of story, unfortunately. Please do note, however, that this season was not exactly designed to have a long-running narrative that will satisfy viewers with an complete, self-contained story; this is an ongoing manga series, after all, and it's really only in season two that the story takes off. That said, I can at least provide a bit more context here and elaborate on HeroAca's world. Deku lives in a world where 80% of the population manifest a specific superpower, or\"quirk\", while the other 20% remain \"quirkless\", a minority to which Deku belongs. Because of his being quirkless and yearning to be a superhero, his childhood is one of loneliness and victimization by bullies. There is no greater bully, however, than Katsuki \"Kacchan\" Bakugo, who used to be his friend but, due to his extremely powerful quirk and constant praising by those around him, allowed his ego, pride, and arrogance to reach astronomical heights and now sees Deku as a worthless person he can trample on his journey to reach the top. Both boys want to be heroes, albeit for completely different reasons: Deku because he wants to help people (in the dub), Bakugo because he wants to embody his rage and totally annihilate enemies. The perspectives leading to those reasons, as well as their personal interactions, do slightly change depending on whether you are watching the original Japanese dub versus the English dub (the latter of which I recommend; more on that a bit later), but a consistent factor is that both boys greatly idolize the world's strongest and most successful superhero, All Might. Very few people know who All Might is and even fewer know the true nature of his quirk, but he is indeed a true hero, and one of the cooler characters of the series, if not because he is hilarious, then because of all the crazy feats he accomplishes. In the first two episodes, All Might rescues Deku from a villain which results in Deku learning All Might's deepest secret: his superheroing days are almost up due to a grievous injury he sustained a few years back. Upon seeing that Deku is quirkless but has the true spirit of a hero, All Might chooses him to be his successor and passes on his quirk, One for All, to him and helps him get accepted to U.A. so he can train under All Might as a future hero. Meanwhile there are some bad guys doing bad guy things that are ultimately unimportant for the season as they are woefully underdeveloped, but since the season focuses so much on Deku's development, and given how entertaining it is, I find myself forgiving the lack of outright villains. Bakugo is a worthy rival and his relationship with Deku is extremely dynamic and complex: easily one of the best rivalries in recent anime. Now for how the characters change between the English and Japanese versions of the show. For this part, I strongly recommend watching ExclamationPoint's videos (just search \"Subs versus Dubs My Hero Academia\")  on YouTube, as they go far more in depth than I can explain right here. If you don't want to spend half an hour doing that, though, (your loss) I will briefly summarize it here. Deku is the one who changes the most; in the dub, he is portrayed as having a strong will to help people, a quality he greatly admires in All Might, and vice versa. In the sub, however, Deku is more like a video game fanboy who just wants to live out his fantasy of being a superhero more than anything in the world, and idolizes All Might as a figure to aspire to be (this also explains the sense of respect he has for Bakugo's abilities). While many people recommend the sub, I have to recommend the dub because of how the different versions of Deku fit (or not fit) in the world of HeroAca that he is in. Sub-Deku is easily the more realistic of the two versions: of course a teenage kid would act rashly just fulfill his fantasy dream of being a hero, especially if he believes it to be entirely unattainable. But the setting doesn't at all reflect a sense of realism, at least not in season one. Do you really think that normal humans would allow peaceful coexistence with a superpowered and uncontrollable species of people to the point that the new species has effectively taken over the world? Probably not. Maybe that's just the cynical pessimist in me saying that, but still. If I wanted realism regarding superpowered populations and their interaction with normal people, I would rewatch The Unlimited - Hyoubu Kyousuke or Tiger & Bunny, and if I wanted to see what a future world run by superpowered conquerers where they are the majority would be like, I would reread House of M. Yes, they are all significantly darker (Tiger & Bunny albeit a bit less so), but that's just how the world works in real life. In short, the world HeroAca presents is one of positive idealism to the point where it is unrealistic, so why would we want to have a main character who is genuinely realistic, which in turn is contradictory to the fact that he WANTS A PLACE in that unrealistic, idealized world? It doesn't make sense, so for that, I personally believe the English dub to be better. That said, I still recommend that you decide for yourself which one you prefer, and the best way to gauge that, I think, would be to watch the first two episodes of both versions. Take CAREFUL NOTE of everything Deku says and is said to him, especially in the presence of Bakugo and professional heroes, and then decide. \\n\\n\r\n                      STILL,\\n\\n\r\nthere are some problems regarding Deku that I want to discuss. I won't be able to go into as much detail as I would like given the restraint on spoilers, but that's okay. Firstly, the long and short of it is that One for All is absolutely, unequivocally broken. When I first started this series, I went in totally blind except for the fact that Deku was quirkless. So there I am, expecting to see him become something like Batman, or Black from \"The End League\", both of whom have to use resources, gadgets, superior skills, and intellect to win their fights. Deku has the intellect at the start of the series, but is lacking everything else, and I was wondering how he would be able to compete with the other students. Well, the show answered very quickly: literally just make him a god-in-training. The way One for All works is that with each succession, the quirk gets more and more powerful i.e. Deku in his prime will inherently be more powerful than All Might in his prime, who was practically unbeatable. Yes, Deku does have to train tirelessly to fully harness One for All and make it his own, but that's not really too much of a struggle since he has All Might there holding his hand the whole way. Again, not to spoil anything, but there is a villain in the series that is essentially someone One for All must defeat as part of a generations-old battle between good and evil; would it not be more interesting if One for All only got weaker with every generation? All Might could barely fend off that guy, and he was IN HIS PRIME. Having Deku be weaker would make for a more interesting battle. He already has to outsmart his opponents in U.A., so why not make this the ultimate test of body and mind, not just soul? It seems like a really big cop-out that Deku will get so strong that defeating this villain will be like snapping his fingers and then suddenly he is hailed as the best; that's just poor, lazy writing. Despite this, though, in reality, Deku's broken power set is (somehow) not the worst flaw of how his character is written. Rather, it's his TOTAL LACK OF EMOTIONAL STRUGGLE. It's true that many of the other students can wipe the floor with him (for now) as they have superior use of their quirks, but he still manages to win every single fight he is in, maybe not by the rules that are set, but in his own way. There is almost no goal that he fails to achieve, no sense of genuine loss, and the only struggle he has achieving those goals comes in the way of physical pain through the use of his quirk and nothing else. There is a moment later in the manga where his mom considers taking him out of U.A. because it's extremely dangerous, but after a few tears are shed by them both and he agrees to her wishes, she relinquishes just like that. What the actual hell? Where is the emotional struggle here? Where is the internal conflict? Where is the panel of Deku asking himself, genuinely asking himself, \"Is this what I want the most important person in my life to feel forever just so I can live out this fantasy of mine?\" (Remember, manga-Deku is Sub-Deku, not Dub-Deku). There's no growth in his character because he lacks internal conflict and there's no room for improvement because everything else about him is leveled up to the absolute max to the point where even some of his fellow students, people he considers equals, friends, and rivals, put him up on the same pedestal he puts All Might on. What does that say about his character but that he is already All Might, just not in power? How could Deku possibly develop when he has already reached that ultimate goal of being like his idol? That's like someone saying Luke Skywalker is as amazing as Ben Kenobi right when he receives his lightsaber. That's ludicrous!!!! There is only a small character arc with Deku in season one of this show, and just from reading the first 11 volumes of the still-ongoing manga, I doubt that he will grow anymore. He may be a great hero in the sense of HeroAca's world, but Deku is a terrible hero in the lens of \"Hero's Journey\".\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nWell, it's Studio Bones. What do you expect? Of course the action scenes are going to look pretty amazing, and although season two steps it up further, there is still a lot to like about season one, particularly in episodes 7 and 12. The art style is a bit cartoony, to say the least, but I think that's a good thing considering the unrealistic nature of the setting. It still looks really polished and you can tell . The backgrounds all look great, the character designs are all extremely unique, and the opening theme animations are all super (again, season two really improves on this, but season one is still deserving of merit).\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\n\"You Say Run goes with everything.\" That came from somewhere, guys. If you know that saying/meme, then you likely know that the music, for the most part, really conveyed a sense of intensity and kinetic energy during the action scenes, but I was pleasantly surprised by the first two episodes' use of remixed versions of \"You Say Run\" to invoke feelings of hope, joy, and even sorrow; if you listen carefully, you can hear it playing on certain string instruments. Aside from those two episodes and the actions scenes, though, the show itself didn't really provide memorable tracks in my ears; there is a slight lack of emotion through the rest of the score, but season two brings on the feels really well (Uraraka's phone call, for example), music included. Now that I think about it, though, I can't blame season one's score for being a bit less emotional than season two's; there just aren't as many emotional scenes.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting:\\n\r\nI wrote about how the dialogue changes between the two versions, but, really, both of them are amazing. If I had to choose between which one I prefer from a performance standpoint, I think I would still stick with the English dub. Funimation did the dubbing, and there are a lot famous voice actors that I have come to love over the years; Christopher Sabat as All Might really is a show-seller on his own. That aside, everyone did a great job: Justin Briner as Deku, J. Michael Tatum as Iida, Monica Rial as Asui (amazing display of vocal range there) and the list goes on. Jerry Jewell (Kyo from Fruits Basket, Russia from Hetalia) as Principal Nezu was amazing :D.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nSo I basically eviscerated Deku as a character, but there is still so much I enjoy about the show, especially its action scenes. Season one lacks sufficient development for the majority of its characters, but season two really steps up during the Tournament Arc. If you are looking for just one solid, inarguable reason to watch HeroAca season one, it's to be ready for season two. If you want more reasons, there are a lot; the animation is fantastic, the action is hype as hell, we can easily root for Deku in his underdog quest, and the character interactions are great and often comedic. You would be hard-pressed to find a recent Shounen anime that is as polished and entertaining as this. Enjoy! Happy watching, and thanks for reading!\\n\\n\r\n- LightningComet \\n",

            "content": "With the big three Shonen series (Except of course for One Piece) finally seeming to be dead and gone it was only a matter of time before a new Shonen Jump long runner came along to stand shoulder the shoulder with HunterxHunter. \r\nMy Hero Academia aims to be that series and while it has little new to offer in terms of groundbreaking takes on western superheroes in anime, at least nothing the Tiger and Bunny and One Punch Man haven't already said well enough on their own, this series is very good at being exactly what it it. A Shonen designed to be as longrunning as possible with as many interesting grudge matches, human character interactions and dynamic arcs to keep you engaged until then.\\n\r\nI will not lie, the story is par for the course, even so far with any superhuman high school story we've all seen a million times over our fandom experience, looking through any of our lists will yield at least one series with a similar premise, it is almost guaranteed. How My Hero succeeds is in that it is very good at being just that.\\n\r\nFights are dynamic with Bones at the helm, seeming no less skilled in their craft in what could've been a back burner series carried along by the Shonen Jump label alone and most likely broken even for a good enough stretch.\\n\r\nSound is passing, with all the background music fitting perfectly into it's place. The score is only as it is because of the amazing \"My Day\" by Porno Graffiti which serves as the OP.\\n\r\nHow this series will sink or swim however will be, with any real superhero story, on how much the audience can find something to love about our characters and become invested in fight scenes that must be enjoyable in an of themselves. This is My Hero's greatest strength. As a superhero geek I will say that the heroes, like many western style heroes created recently in Japan is that they lack a motif or their motif is convoluted or not well thought out. A very disappointing example of this is a space suit themed hero with black hole powers that instead of names like \"Orbit\", \"Hayabusa\" or \"NASA\" was named \"13\" a mantle whose meaning still puzzles me. \\n\r\nThe series also does an almost Jojo esque job of mixing in familiar power sets such as Super Speed, Anti Gravity and Animal features with more offbeat and situational powers that all get their spots to shine, though some of the cast is left in the cold with only 13 episodes running.\\n\r\nOverall while My Hero Academia wont really be anyone's new FMA or Bebop it is entirely possible that it will serve as the Naruto of the anime generations going forward, and this series proves to establish a firm bedrock for good action anime for them.",

            "content": "Let's talk about one of the best lineup of Sring 2016 season and also a strong contender of the AOTY, Boku no Hero Academia.\r\nThe story follows the exploits of the main character called Deku by just one guy. His name is too long so I won't take trouble writing it and henceforth he would be called Deku. In a world full of superheroes and superpowers, Deku is born abnormal; by that I mean he has no superpowers. He waits and waits but he doesn't discover his powers; though that doesn't stop him from dreaming and unlike the world and he believes that nor should it.He excels in his studies and observes and makes notes about other superheroes. I almost thought that he would be batman, and became really curious how they would make a shounen batman. Enters a superman-esque superhero, whose powers unlike other powers can be transferred. And, then Deku became a superman- esque hero with super strength and somewhat super speed. That made a lot of sense as Superman unlike batman can be a shounen hero. He enters the elite school of superheroes where he meets a rival and few friends. That's a pretty uninspired story and is similar to all the popular shounen stories.  Despite that it also contains that weird charm that all of these good shounen have. Even while having the same overused and cliched story, the charm makes it going and made me want to watch the next episode. If someone is expecting something new or an innovative plot this anime ain't for them. You will find that this anime ticked all the shounen tags quite diligently and repeatedly, and I am not a fan when an anime does that. I continued as I was aware of the hype before the anime began airing. Also, like me there would be watchers who would be excited by the concept of having japan try the american superhero story. I know that this isn't new as many anime have tried that yet every time I hear a superhero anime I become excited and like me if you purely want a superhero anime then this is a pretty good one. Thus, my reason for considering this story as good. Also, another thing that I didn't like about the anime was the ending, specifically where the anime ended. I would have wanted the anime to be 20+ episode one. It had the usual 1 episode random stories to get things started and from there on it suddenly introduced the villain and his sidekicks and their so called evil plan. I felt it was abrupt and it felt rushed. Either they should have taken more time to introduce the characters and kept the last dome training arc for the next season or they should have added on more episodes to gradually set the tone. Instead due to time constraints they had to rush the whole thing and the last arc felt forced.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with having a large cast of characters is to make them all interesting. To make them interesting all the characters don't have to stand out or create havoc to make their presence felt. There have been plenty of characters whose presence is hardly felt yet they create an aura of mystery whenever they are around. All of this can be done by making each character somewhat humanish, a wee bit more real. Many manga writers have succeeded in doing that. The problem with large cast is the fact that to do justice to each character, a different personality is required for each character. Herein, this anime conveniently borrows personality from its predecessors. It's not like that this is the only one. Many shounen anime borrow or steal personalities from the more famous shounen. The most blatant copy I felt was the personality of Deku's teacher Aizawa. He was completely lifted from Kakashi of Naruto. Many more characters I felt along the anime could be found in any of the big 3 and other famous anime. Thus, this anime really lags in characters. Though, I genuinely liked Deku's character. He too was nothing original, yet when I saw how hard he tried to overcome his weakness, it kind of moved me. Also, the fact that he was born devoid any kind of talent resonated with me. I long to see some character development in the anime, at least from Deku, as there was none in the first season. This can again be attributed to the length of the anime. In the first 4 episodes he was just a plain guy with no powers. When the actual story began within 3-4 episodes it rushed off to an arc which itself didn't provide any growth for the MC. All of other cast was vibrant but they weren't in any way interesting. The rival exists just because its cool to have one. To sum it up all I can say is that the characters were all uninspired.\\n\\n\r\nNow moving on to the art and sound, I in one thought that the art was pretty cool. The character designs were all very unique and did give off an American vibe, more specifically a comic vibe. I thought that this was pretty cool and was consistent with the overall superhero theme of the anime. The use of color and over all color pallet used in the anime was very vibrant. The anime was colorful and was very pleasing to see. The voice acting too was good and helped to some extent in giving a different personality to the character. I really enjoyed both the opening and ending songs and was energetic and refreshing. So no complaints in this department.  \\n\\n\r\nAs expected of a shounen anime the dialogues shined in the cool lines department. Unlike most shounen anime the normal conversation dialogues didn't suck completely, though they weren't good either. Although this could be attributed to the fact that there wasn't much of dialogue in the anime to begin with. As all shounen anime the best part of the anime was the fight scenes. It was very well animated and was with fluid movements and also engaging OST, which helped create an intense environment.  I felt that the fight scenes were thing that kept the anime going.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all watch this anime if you want a mindless battle shounen. And, if like me you are interested and into superhero anime then this is a sweet treat. Watch this and then get hyped for the next soon to come season.\\n",

Don't forget : This is your dream.\"\r\nBoku no Hero Academia, we follow a 15 years old boy named Midoriya who wants to achieves his dream of becoming a super hero. Hard you say? In this world having a super power is completely normal. In fact 80% of the population possess a \"quirk\". With this established, the world is similar to the ones found in comic books, where super vilain and super heroes exist. In this world, the profession of Super Hero is in demand. To achieve his dream, Midoriyatries to attend UA High School, the most prestigious Hero training school in the world. Oh and did I mention he's quirk-less? Ya won't be so easy for lil' Midoriya.\\n\\n\r\n** SPOILER REVIEW **\\n\\n\r\nSTORY \\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nI can't give it a 10 because it's not finished yet but this story surprisingly holds its own. Let me explain. This anime manages to make the viewers wonder what other crazy battle or enemies the students and the teacher (aka super heroes) will face. My Hero Academia has a world where vilains are everywhere and heroes are needed! It is believable that if 80% of the population had a super power, there's bond to be some who aren't using it for good. \\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nI'm not picky with art. As long as there's no obvious mistakes and that the animation is smooth I won't rate it below 9. The world is well drawn and pictured. I really like UA's campus. Uraraka is visually adorable and Todoroki is bad-ass. Visually all different and easy to spot. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nI'm a sucker for this kind of music. It's soooo catchy. I'm already singing the intro. The atmosphere is well put throughout the anime, there's no long silences. Again, I'm not super picky but I like my background music. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nI'm in love with these characters, honestly they're so fun and unique! (Season 2 also helps here) Midoriya is not my favorite but his character is your typical dream boy who won't give up and I dig it. I'm a big fan of  ASui (sue) character and Iida. There's obviously a great dynamic being build here and I can't wait to see them grow. Bakugo is definitely my favorite, at first I was scared he was going to turn bad but I love how they made him heroic in his own sadistic way. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nOkay I binged it. Subbed and Dubbed. Loved it.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\n9.5 buuuut I round up so 10!",

            "content": "To start off my first ever review of an anime on MAL, I would like to state that this easily lands in my top 5 anime. Without a doubt it has been one of my favorite shows to watch and I cannot wait to enjoy the next season.\r\nBy the way, I have watched both the dub and sub and can say that the DUB is stupendous and I vastly prefer it. Chris Sabat does some amazing work and his voicing of All Might is superb\r\nMy rant about the best is yet to come, but I want to address the worst of this anime first. IT'STOO DAMN SHORT! If you love this anime half as much as I do, then you will be left longing for more. The characters don't all have enough time to be developed fully, and this season is mostly about Izuku Midoriya and briefly some of his classmates/fellow heroes. This anime is but a taste of a much more delicious feast. I only wish it went on for more than 13 episodes. Now i'm reading the manga to try and curb my addiction to this heart-pumping shounen masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, there are too many things to love about this anime. From its detailed action scenes and bombastic soundtrack, to the stupendous pacing and fairly unique (albeit often predictable) plot. The character design is so varied and all the different powers just make the world come alive. I cannot recommend this anime enough to anyone who has ever loved an electrifying story of achievement, struggle, perseverance, and action.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR WATCH THIS ANIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nSide-note: If you aren't loving this anime within the first few episodes, then please stick with it till at least episode 12. Yes that is the 12th out of 13 and if you made it that far just finish it, but the reason I put this at the end is because episode 12 has got to have one of the most awe inspiring scenes i've ever watched. For my fellow DBZ fans, imagine that moment when you saw goku go super saiyan for the first time. THIS. ANIME. HAS. THAT. MOMENT. I will avoid spoilers, but I will leave it as such: All Might gives the most impressive display of heroism TO DATE. Also the dub of it is epic",

            "content": "The moment I watched the first episode I recognized the main character Midoriya Izuku from somewhere I don't recall. Turns out that I saw a short manga of the few big anime main character (Goku, Ichigo, Naruto, and Luffy) with him again and realized he was from there. And that is when I know that this would be the so-called \"big thing\" in the making. But is it really?\r\nOur main character - timid in nature, a try-hard, and wants to be a hero, but he doesn't have a power called \"quirks\" because of something stupid. But if he doesn't have any power, why is hethe \"main character\"? Lo and behold, he does have a power - given by his idol! Thus there begins the Hero's Journey trope to school. The pacing of the anime becomes slow around episode 4 at a main character vs rival fight, and while it does flesh out a little of the main characters, it could be easily done with lesser time without dragging it for 2 episodes. Quickly after was a real fight that brought the anime to an end - disappointing due to narration of main character's future self that brings hype to the viewers for the next episode and having to wait for the season 2 that would be happening in the future.\\n\\n\r\nAll of BnHA's important character designs are unique, as well as the quirks they have. It is particularly funny to me that every hero is compulsory to have their hero uniform - perhaps to be easily spotted by the others and to signal to their foes, \"Hey, I'm a hero!\" Character development is subtle in BnHA season 1 for they only have 13 episodes, but I am happy that they take the time to explain some of the important classmates' abilities even if it were around 5 seconds long. Another noteworthy point is the heroes understood their weakness and does not go headlong towards every enemy they see - and this is also a weakness to the characters. Understandable. Not to the bearer of plot armor Izuku because he won't die either way. Despite rushing into danger almost every single time, he does think before charging in, making him an interesting character, though often plague with doubt.\\n\\n\r\nBnHA's character design, as mentioned before, was unique to each heroes and heroes-to-be, most of them due to their quirks which some of them I have not thought to be seen to the amount of fantasy anime I have watched. The art wasn't the best thing I've ever seen, but it is well made.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds are alright. I did not pay much attention to it. I particularly like All Might's voice actor who successfully delivers his one-liner well and gives an impact to the viewers and characters inside the anime alike about his presence.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime well, but it was short that it does not have time to flesh out the characters well. It feels like a 24-episode anime that was cut short. A few moments I feel that the anime rushed, and some dragged around unnecessarily. Fortunately, it is announced that the second season would be coming and I look forward for the continuity of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it is good because I like shounen anime and the main character isn't too much of an idiot or overpowered. He understands his limitation too much and doesn't show much of his contribution to the anime at this point, but the foreshadowing of his abilities, especially from the narration of his future self does allow one to look forward for his growth. I do worry that the amount of characters shown does not allow the anime to completely flesh out every single one of them, leaving them being a useless supporting character. About it being the next big thing - well, only time will tell. But with this first season, it isn't enough.",

            "content": "Shonen genre has always either received a lot of love or hate, which ever camp you belong to this is an anime which will resonate well with everyone alike.\r\nSTORY:\r\nFirst season introduces us to Deku, All Might, and majority of the students of class 1-A. Though it majorly focuses mostly on deku and All Might. The story might feel like a cliche shonen story where the MC dreams to become the strongest in the world or like his role model(here it\u2019s \u201cAll Might\u201d) but that is where all the cliches end, the way character motivations and the overall plot are handled is refreshing while still maintainingall the major parts which have made this genre so popular.\\n\r\nBones has nailed the pacing, I haven\u2019t read the manga but from what I\u2019ve heard it is a very faithful adaptation of the manga.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nIf you look up the character designs for the manga and compare it to the anime designs you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find any difference. Though it is very different from your generic designs and might require to get used to it but once you get used to it you\u2019ll fall in love with them.\\n\r\nAnimation is top notch as expected by Bones. I haven\u2019t noticed any drops in the animation, but there might be a few if you go looking for it with a magnifying glass.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nOP and ED are very good and memorable, especially the ED.\\n\r\nThe thing which stood out the most in the sound department is the OST. Apart from being epic on its own, the OST was utilised well giving those epic chill down the spine moments. Though it is overused, I prefer quality over quantity.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nIt is this department which kinda felt lacking (at least for the first season) as we are introduced to multitude of charcters but the story focused only on deku, All Might and a little of Bakug\u014d. This is kinda expected with limited 13 episode run, but what we got is more than enough, the character motivations and development were handled really well. \\n\r\nThe characters are the main USP for this show and the story handles them with respect. Every character introduced has a motive and required for the advancement of the plot without them being there for the sake of it. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI don\u2019t mind incomplete ending as long as the journey to this end is very enjoyable, if the ending is paramount for you, I recommend you wait,as this is a train with its destination still nowhere in sight but tends to take breaks at the stations in between(unlike Naruto and detective Conan). At least it doesn\u2019t have the \u201cGO READ THE MANGA\u201d-ish Cliff hanger ending(for both the seasons). Action and comedy strike a nice balance in keeping this show entertaining. If you are new to anime then nothing is a better gateway than this one. I\u2019ve seen people who hate anime fall in love with this show.\\n\r\nAnd how can I forget the epic OST, it just heightened the enjoyment of this show\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR:If you are lazy enough to read the review, I recommend you just go and watch this show nevertheless as out of the story,character,art and the epic music this show offers something will definitely catch your interest\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Where the main character is weak compared to others, but has big dreams. Also, like many other shounen there is a rival who is almost the opposite of the main character. \r\nStory\r\nIn this world about 80% of the population possesses quirks-special powers. Our main character's dream is to become a hero like All Might-strongest hero of justice. The only problem is that our hero is part of the 20% of the population. \r\nAnimation/Art\r\nBoth  are very good. Artand animation make the costumes and powers stand out. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nNothing too impressive but it's pretty decent. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nOnly 3 main characters get a good amount of development in this season. Other character are cool but we really don't know much about them. Hoping season 2 will give them more development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis is where the show really shines. It's very enjoyable. Similar to Marvel movies, it's nothing too complex but it's very entertaining to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall season 1 is very good. It sets up the show very well. If you like shounen and superheros then this show is a must watch. Even if your not a fan of shounen, give it a try you'll probably at least find some enjoyment out of it.",

I can say this is a anime where you will see a little of everything, from sad moments, to overcoming examples, from funny moments, to exciting scenes of battle.\r\nThe characters have a good development, even in 13 episodes they already catched me with their charisma. All Migth fulfills his hole of  \"all migth\", Midoriya showedhis potencial as bold protagonist and Bakugo... fits as the stressed boy. Here we have many well developed characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe studio (Bones) made a great job, fantastic animation, amazing soundtrack and good VA, also made a faithful adaptation from the manga.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the most important thing I saw in Boku no Hero academia, I saw a lot of potencial.

I'd like to thinkthat I'm above all that immature stupidity, but a tiny tiny tiny tiny amount of fan service is totally fine.  For example, I don't want all the woman in my television shows to be devoid of sex appeal and I don't want all the characters to completely ignore that sex appeal.  However, in real life, people don't just straight up rape women.  I just want it closer to normal.

            "content": "Boku no Hero Academia is what its sypnosis says. It is an anime about superheroes, in ways, a comic book turned anime. \r\nI'll try to keep it short and simple:\r\nStory:\r\nThe story doesn't come as a shocker, and anyone can guess the plot-line directly after reading the synopsis. It's a straightforward story that doesn't strangle your mind with complicated twists.\r\nArt:\r\nThe art is what you'd want to expect from a world of heroes and villains. It is not by any means crisp or drawn with cutting edge animations, but it rather gives you a feel of actually watching a comic book in action. The characters are drawnwell-enough, with shading and lighting that gives each character a heroic or antagonistic appearance.  \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis is what shocked me the most. I for one am not a fan of listening to the opening songs and ending songs in every episode; but the songs in this anime was something you could keep on hearing and jam to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThere wasn't much character development apart from the main character and another character to be honest. There also isn't a lot of background details given for characters. However, you have to appreciate the characters for what you see in the anime and judge them accordingly; all the characters are pretty straight-forward.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis is what the anime is basically all about, enjoyment. It's a universe of heroes and villains and the story of a boy who gains special powers and enrolls in a school for heroes. It is a comic in an anime, tapping somewhere into childhood fantasies of being heroes ourselves. What more could you ask for? \\n\\n\r\nJust a quick summary:\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Opening and ending songs\\n\r\n- Hero Universe\\n\r\n- A suited story for a hero anime\\n\r\n- Doesn't rush it for a 13 episode anime\\n\r\n- Great action scenes\\n\r\n- Unique super powers\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Comedy at times is a bit dull\\n\\n\r\nDebatable (Differs from people to people):\\n\r\n- Artwork\\n\r\n- Cliche story-line\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Opinions:\\n\r\nWith giving the basic idea of the anime, there are a lot of things that some people will find different from others, as it can be seen from the other reviews, hence, I'll give my own opinion on this anime. \\n\r\nThe art felt a bit disappointing in the first episode, but as it progressed, I got used to it and started to like it along the way, fitting in with the feel of the story-line. The story line is a bit cliche, but it still works. It doesn't put you off and keeps you intrigued of what goes down in the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nBoku no Hero Academia taps into our childhood fantasies of becoming super-heroes, and puts it into this anime. It is an enjoyable anime, giving us an anime that puts a comic into life. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an anime with deep character backgrounds, unique story-line, multiple twists and a dark truth behind all the extravagance, trying to make logic out of every detail, this anime is not for you. \\n\r\nIf you, however, want to enjoy yourself with 13 episodes of heroic, edge-of-your-seat action, unique super powers, hero-school training, villain-worthy villains and an appetite to save others, this anime is for you. Remember, even you can be a hero.\\n",

            "content": "I've always been a sucker for the generic action shounens. Boku no Hero Academia is no different but there are certainly some critical flaws and successes in the anime.  Also as a sidenote-  I love and keep up with the manga, and I believe that the story in the manga gets better after the part that the anime adapted.\r\nTo start off, one of the gripes i have with this anime is the somewhat slow pacing. The anime only went through 8 chapters of the manga with the first 6 episodes of the anime. I'm pretty sure even One Piece right now goes throughmore chapters in 6 episodes. I understand why the pacing is so slow though because the anime wanted to conclude right after Deku faces his first villains(trying not to spoil too much), mostly because that arc functioned as a good conclusion for an anime getting another season. However the slow pacing in the beginning still decreased enjoyability for me.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, Deku's character (the protagonist) is really annoying at times. In the manga this can be overlooked because his character is constantly played off as being purposefully very generic for comedic effect, though Deku is still quite irritating in the manga as well. In the anime, however, Deku's sniveling and cry baby attitude can be extremely irritating at times. I understand this is all part of Deku's characterization but I feel like it could have been pulled off better than it has been in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the good stuff about the anime, the animation is quite beautiful to look at and I like the way they animate Izuku's punches in superpower mode. Also even with the pacing issue, the anime is still very enjoyable and doesn't require too much mental stimulation which makes for a great anime to watch when you want to relax. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like a nice superhero story with interesting abilities and an underdog protagonist, this anime is definitely for you. Boku no Hero Academia isn't particularly deep or introspective or anything like that, but it is a fun watch as long as you don't mind the pacing. It isn't a must watch, nor is it a definitely avoid, Boku no Hero Academia falls comfortably in above average territory.",

            "content": "When thinking about superheroes, the phrase, \u201clarger than life\u201d might come to the mind. With the rise of superhero-themed movies and T.V. shows, it would be an understatement to say that stories about superheroes hasn\u2019t influenced pop culture. Inspired from Marvel and DC Comics, Horikoushi Kouhei presents Boku no Hero Academia. \r\nBoku no Hero Academia is a play by play anime that derives its story and artwork from the source material. Meaning that the visuals and story is almost equivalent to the manga. The story of Boku no Hero Academia is about a powerless middle schooler aspiring to become something bigger than he can possiblyimagine \u2013 a superhero. The show follows our main character, Izuku Midoriya, and his journey to become the greatest hero the world has ever seen. To describe this story in other words, this is a coming of age anime. \\n\\n\r\nWith that being said, this type of story couldn\u2019t happen without its characters. There are two types of people in the world of Boku no Hero Academia. Those who have \"quirks\" and those who don\u2019t. Unfortunately, for our main character, Izuku Midoriya, doesn\u2019t have \u201cquirks\u201d. Personally, it\u2019s quite interesting to see the people around him try to bring him down and help him grow. In a way, one might say, Katsuki Bakugou, his classmate, is his rival since he\u2019s this intimidating person who sees Izuku Midoriya as this pathetic kid and is absolutely disgusted on how he aspires to become a hero despite being \u201cquirkless\u201d. As for the rest of the characters, even though there are a lot of them being present in the opening theme song of the anime, rest assured, they play a useful role that gives them time to shine. However, with well story and character development comes pacing issues. The anime is paced at a very slow rate \u2013 making this the show\u2019s downfall \u2013 in killing the vibe of those who want the gratification of seeing action.\\n\\n\r\nIt is clear that the overall design of the show as well as the designs of the characters were inspired by American superhero comics. Boku no Hero Academia is filled with bright and warm vibrant colors that give it a comic-like effect. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme song, \u201cThe Day\u201d by Porno Graffitti, is a J-Rock track that tries to pump up the viewer\u2019s blood for the show. The ending theme song, \u201cHEROES\u201d by Brian the Sun, on the other hand, is \u2013 sadly \u2013 a forgettable J-Rock track. However, after some episodes, the ending theme song feels like it fits the show. \\n\\n\r\nBoku no Hero Academia is a thrilling coming of age storyline about a boy, who is powerless, aspiring to become a superhero. Those expecting a lot of fast, intense, and action packed episodes might not entirely be satisfied with the way the show progresses due to the pacing. However, it sticks true to the original manga leaving viewers \u2013 who have read it \u2013 to know what to expect.",

Though it isn't something I've seen before, it made so hooked. Midoriya's story made me cry and support him. The story behind each of the characters are magnificently told and they were oh so great.\r\nArt:\r\nThe art is absolutely fantastic, especially the animation, though some character designs were over the top, it didn't hinder. The action scenes are so fantastic, you always get choked whenever there's that very suspenseful moment. \r\nSound:\r\nI'm in love with the OP and mesmerized by the ED, theBGMs made the scenes so fantastic, like it makes you cry whenever that music plays, or smile due to how perfect the music was to that great of a scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Midoriya, is so likable, though he cries a lot, it makes him more grounded to the reality. I like how he runs to save his friends and everything. All Might is the model of an ideal hero, amazing and admirable and reckless. Bakugou, is so cool, and it makes you cheer for him with his backstory. The other characters are so amazing and they blend quite well together.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to have fun and cry at the same time, this anime is for you. It does not only have action but there's drama and a little mystery... It's so beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is one of the best animes I've watched.",

            "content": "Anime is rife with adaptations. Conventional. Uninspired. Confused. They tend to get lost somewhere out in the vast sea that is this medium. Thankfully, Shounen Jump adaptations usually receive much-needed love from studios in Japan. Though Boku no Hero Academia borrows tropes and elementary themes, this adaptation thrives in its exemplary execution owing to Studio Bones's amelioration.\r\nToday, any semblance of mediocrity in narrative works is lost. Right away, the first scene of Boku no Hero Academia throws in themes of powerlessness, blind-faith, and heroism. The show excels at relaying the main character's ideals, unreasonable faith and determination, and all the emotions that come withthem. One step, one more, we struggle with him for three whole episodes, growing ever attached to him and his cause. More importantly, this sets the character up for the narrative, renouncing his previous pathetic state for a man of gravitas and aspirations. He is naive. He is deserving. He has resolve. The first act of a strong character arc - done with ease.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the main character, the three side characters do not fail to impress. They are the pure embodiment of cool - a paragon of a true hero, a self-respecting rival and a supportive mother. The little details and perspectives they have, add life and make them more compelling -ly cool. Boku no Hero Academia uses their unique relationship dynamics with the main character to drive interest and intrigue in every important scene. Every piece of the show is laid down with either of the two characters or the main character being at stake or in mind. They understand that having emotional weight in action scenes represents a vital appeal in the show.\\n\\n\r\nExcellent production quality also drives appeal. Other than the subpar background art, the art and animation of Boku no Hero Academia are nothing short of stellar. The amount of detail in the character art cannot be understated - facial cues are distinctive and concise, colour tones are rich and profound, and the comprehensively drawn lines and details show cool character in every frame. Couple these with great Sakuga animation and the show pleases the eyes at every moment of every action scene.\\n\\n\r\nBeing the studio that brought titles like Fullmetal Alchemist and Soul Eater, there's no doubt that Studio Bones possesses the profundity to handle the action well here. Making use of the ample potential of a Superpower premise, different powers are matched with each other in various scenarios and situations, making many interesting strategies and outcomes. These keep any character and scenario from getting bland and make decisive action scenes all the more jam-packed with cool. Add in emotionally gripping character situations, precise animation and over the top action and we've got a great tasting dessert right here.\\n\\n\r\nThe final toppings just smooth out this experience. Themes and values of being a hero are strewn all over. Arbitrary but cool information, lore and history sweeten the world and context. A-Okay sound effects, Ost's and songs set the atmosphere and mood. Moreover, wordplay, surreal and character comedy plays up as not serious or mood-changing dry humour, final touches of sorts that do not really matter to some and completes the dish for others.\\n\\n\r\nThough, what takes the cake is Studio Bone's grasp of its appeal. They focus on the characters, casts the world and its themes aside and over achieves the action and cool factor. To dive deeper into societal factors, philosophy or other serious world issues would be a naive play. To overplay any other side character to anything but tropes would not be wise either. Mixing in every potentially beautiful theme could very well turn the show into a farce. \\n\\n\r\nCertainly not an epic by any stretch, Boku no Hero Academia is still an astounding piece of art, at least in the minds that are not fundamentally inflexible. You are sure to be satisfied with this work.\\n",

            "content": "Boku no Hero Academia is often credited with revitalized the saturated shounen genre. Many people see it as a show that incorporates the best aspects of shounen battle anime without deconstructing the genre or incorporating a dark twist. While it is refreshing to have a show that doesn't try to be unnecessarily edgy or intellectual, Hero Aca still falls short in numerous departments. \r\nStory 7- Hero Aca premise about a boy born without powers is a world where over 90% of the population manifests a special ability or quirk, had me hooked from the very start. It's a premise that is easy for anyone torelate to, and one with a strong emotional foundation to get viewers to care about the primary characters from the very start. Even now, as a college student, I can relate more than ever to wishing that someone would give me one chance to succeed in the competitive world, much like how All Might passes on One for All for Deku. This premise is enough to keep the show moving for the first few episodes, but midway through pacing becomes a massive issue. Despite being only 13 episodes long, after episode 5 the show slows down dramatically and passing from arc to arc can begin to feel like a chore\\n\\n\r\nArt 5- Considering that Hero Aca was produced by studio bones, a studio is known for vibrant color pallets, expressive character animation, and bombastic fight scenes, I was expecting the animation to be top tier. Needless to say, I was disappointed. Outside of a few instances of hype animation, the artwork for Hero Aca is incredibly flat. Characters are stiff and barely move. Backgrounds feel boring and lifeless, especially in classroom settings. While there are some pretty great fights, they are not outstanding enough to make up for the generic animation overall. When compared to Mob Psycho 100, Space Dandy, and even Soul Eater the animation simply doesn't hold up \\n\\n\r\nSound- The soundtrack of Hero Aca is by far my favorite aspect of the series, aside from its premise. HERO A never fails to send chills down my spine while You Say Run is always timed perfectly with fight scenes. The OP is pretty standard but still manages to build hype.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- The problem with Hero Aca's characters is that they introduce too many too fast. The first 3 episodes center entirely on Deku and his relationship with All Might and Bakugo. These three episodes flesh out these characters tremendously in such a short period of time, especially Deku. Afterwards, we are introduced to supporting characters Uraraka and Iida, but before they can be fleshed out even remotely as much as Deku, we are introduced to an entire class with 16 addition characters as well as numerous instructors, and then a group of villains on top of that. Remember each characters personality, quirk, or even name is nearly impossible on a single viewing. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall 6- While it may appear that I am being overly critical of this series, I am only doing so for two reasons. For one, while I feel that Hero Aca has a great premise and a great main character, it has a long way to go before it can be viewed as the savior of the shounen genre. The second reason is that the 2nd season of Hero Aca is absolutely phenomenal and corrects most of the issues I've discussed above. While Hero Aca may not be a masterpiece, it is the predecessor to something quite possibly revolutionary.",

Also the main character develops some OP powers while at first he was a complete noob.\r\nNow those were some pretty harsh parallels but to me it seems just fine since it doesn't really copy Naruto, it just uses the same premise and does it pretty well since this is a universe filled with superheroes.\r\nThe animation is one of my favorites, itjust pops out, like actual comic books were brought to life and even though the characters aren't that developed, they still brimm with life and color.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot advances nicely and I never felt getting bored, there's just always something new happening and I'm really waiting for the second season to come.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're interested then you can watch a more indepth review I made on this anime on my Youtube channel MudanTV. I've spent like over 10 hours composing my thoughts, recording and editing the most awesomest review you'll ever see. If that's not true then feel free to dislike it.",

When the high school years will be over, My Hero Academia will end.\\n\\n\r\nAnd guess what, it's not just on paper. It's as generic as it gets, it's got nothing new, and it does nothing all that interesting. It also lacks depth, even for a shounen, and it could certainly use an actual plot and get somewhere before we get tired of it.\\n\\n\r\nSo why a 9?\\n\\n\r\nBecause it's the most mastered shounen I have seen in maybe my whole life. There's always a flaw to poke at, big or small, always something that really irks me at some point; One Piece, who has now sailed for the Seas of Neverending, had terrible fights and worthless drama that fell flat because nobody dies in OP no matter how much punishment they take, Naruto went so far up its ass with its Sasuke side and so wrong in its themes it just about shot itself, and even if we go older or less renown, I can probably point out one or two big problems I have with every Shounen that got famous at some point.\\n\\n\r\nSo is Boku no Hero the one who fixes everything? I don't think so. I think it's the one that plays it safe and controlled. To me creation always has to undergo a choice of creativity or mastery, you experiment and try something new and creative, or you go for the known ground and do what you already did but better, fixing the former flaws.\\n\\n\r\nBoku no Hero is in every way a sort of weak, dare-nothing anime, but strangely enough, maybe because I've been sort of out of shounens for awhile, I don't mind much at all. It's an example to how to make a great shounen, its pacing is pristine, its characters are all a little weak but each different and there's some for everyone, it has no real ultimate qualities like One Piece' humour or Naruto's themes and ideas, but it breezes through anyway because it's just so enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nI have to give special mention to All Might as the \"dad\" character, because for a long time most of the fathers we saw weren't quite fathers. They were half-mothers, protective and caring, or absent fathers, but not fathers in the sense that you get as a child, that your dad is awesome and the greatest man ever and that you want to be like him someday. Even from the opening, All Might is portrayed as this magnificent, distant and amazing person, far taller, stronger, more stylish, in every way superior to Deku, and that's something I always found to be enjoyable, this sensation that \"dad\" was the goal post, and that until Deku is this amazing, he's just a child.\\n\\n\r\nBesides his role as a father figure, All Might is also very interestingly portrayed, because he's human above all. He shows off, he poses, he takes his role extremely seriously, he smiles and acts and does whatever's necessary to be the most amazing hero, but he also has blunders, makes mistakes, can't teach his \"son\", and makes mistakes once in a while. Speaking as an adult male, he feels like an extremely relatable adult male, despite being a great hero(speaking as a not really great hero myself). He's probably the best part of this anime, and the thing that reminds me most of my feelings as a kid.\\n\\n\r\nApart from him, I have generic feelings about the generic characters: Iida is alright, Uraraka is cute as heck, Yaoyorozu is the best, etc. It's not really that they don't deserve mention, it's that like in everything else, they're not really great, and they also don't really have any flaws. I guess Mineta is easily the one character I could see dead fast, he's not enjoyable or fun to me.\\n\\n\r\nHowever besides Deku, who is the standardest of standard shounen underdog-who-fights-the-odds protagonist, I have to mention Katsuki Bakugo, who is...not really getting anywhere fast, it seems. \\n\\n\r\nBakugo has a gimmick: he's pissed off. At everything. He's a guy who would see a building crash on him one morning, and blast it away angrily then yell about it to everyone for the rest of the day. He's a guy who would see a huge gold bar worth 100000000000\u20ac crash on him one morning, and blast it away angrily then yell about it to everyone for the rest of the day. \\n\\n\r\nBy itself I don't mind it. The problem with Bakugo is that his gimmick is obviously played to make him mild-mannered Deku's eternal rival. However, and unlike Sasuke vs Naruto or Vegeta vs Goku(can't believe i'm about to praise Naruto), I find Bakugo to not work at all as a rival.\\n\\n\r\nMy main problem with it is that his gimmick is the sole justification, he hates Deku, ok, but isn't there anything else? Can't this character evolve past his teenage angst and blinding pride? Because there's not that much material there. It's gonna get tiring quite fast.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of \"lacking material\", I'll say the exact same thing about the plot and story of Boku no Hero Academia: there's nothing there.\\n\\n\r\nThey introduce a League of Villains and imply heavily that they're gonna be fought until the end of the anime. Ok.\\n\\n\r\nNow I completed both seasons of My Hero Academia, and guess what, I still barely ever saw or heard of anyone in this League. The main plot seems to be that Deku/Midoriya must grow stronger to become a stronger hero. It's pretty weak and doesn't really get anywhere either.\\n\\n\r\nPlot advancement is almost nil and I think it really stems from Academia's lack of courage when it comes to actually trying anything new or deep. The idea of aiming for generic but mastered is fine by me, but when it comes to plot, villain motivation, anything that actually might lead you to the road of idea->ideology->morality->philosophical battle/moral battle where two different characters with two different ideologies compete for victory, then My Hero just gives up. It stays in the comfort zone of \"I'm fun, you're having fun, let's keep having fun and not think about the big bad complicated things\".\\n\\n\r\nAgain, after 15+ years of Naruto trying SO HARD to be edgy and deep about what ultimately amounted to a big bunch of people throwing energy shit at each other with weird eyes, I don't even want to criticise Academia for being too cautious.\\n\\n\r\nBut shounen is a genre for kids, teenagers and otakus, who aren't looking for deep or complicated things. However they're still looking for \"meaty\" things. Uncomplicated characters is fine in Academia, and so is its simple high school super hero premise. However, if Academia doesn't dare to enter the realm of complexity when it's needed, that will eventually end up hurting it immensely. Its lack of plot is already from that: how can you have a plot or advance it when you don't have a single character with any motivations? Deku, All Might and the others all want to be heroes, that forgettable guy with the hands wants them dead, ok, but why? How did you come to think that? You need actual depth in characters to give root to an ideology, and you need actual ideology for two personalities to face each other.\\n\\n\r\nAcademia doesn't want to have any of that. No ideas, no reasons, just good guys being enjoyably good and bad guys being enjoyably bad, underdogs growing, top spots being challenged, and a ton of great music, fun fights and lovely shounen moments.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a ton of fun. But I wonder how long it can last being so sheltered.",

            "content": "Boku no Hero Academia/My Hero Academia is quickly growing in popularity, and with the second season winding down as I'm writing this, I figured I might as well rewatch the first season and write this review. My Hero Academia starts with about as generic of a story as you can get. Izuku \"Deku\" Midorya is a quirkless (that's this universes name for people without super powers) teenager who's had dreams of becoming a hero since he was young. Of course, he can't exactly do that without a quirk, so all the people in his life basically tell him to give up on his dream andthat he'll never be able to achieve it. That is, until he meets the #1 Hero, All Might, after being attacked by a villain on his way home from school. Eventually, All Might comes to see potential in Deku and decides to pass on his quirk \"One for All\" to him. The rest of the season then shows Deku getting used to his new quirk and beginning his life at U.A. High, a school for becoming a superhero. Despite this incredibly generic premise, MHA manages to bring out the best in its clich\u00e9s and tropes. The entire world of My Hero Academia flips the generic superhero show on its head, mostly by having super powers (in this case, quirks) be a regular thing in the world. Society is dominated by super heroes, their quirks and villains. The first season doesn't go too deep into the world, it still does offer a strong story between Deku and his idol/mentor/teacher, All Might (as well as Katsuki Bakugou, but we'll get to him). I will give MHA a 7/10 for the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in MHA is very good. All the characters have unique and recognizable designs. I love the designs of the pro heroes, and most of the students (particularly best girl Ashido). With just a look at their character designs, you can tell what most of them are all about. Bakugou's spiky hair and aggressive smile immediately tells you he's easy to anger and has an explosive demeanor. I could go into more examples, but it's more fun to let you guys discover that for yourself. I'll just give this an 8/10 and move on.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP of this season, \"The Day\" is just fantastic. I honestly listen to this almost every day. The ED is also very good, but not nearly as good. The soundtrack is just great in general. I'm not a huge fan of music, so I can't say much more than that without getting into an area that I have no idea about. 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the characters. I really love them. Most of the characters in the first season are fairly one-dimensional, however I think that's mostly a good thing. By only giving the supporting characters a small amount of characterization (for now, most of them do get development later on), it allows for the show to focus more on the central dynamic between Deku/Bakugou and Deku/All Might. As for the characters they do develop, Deku is a very strategic thinker, which gets him a few victories in this season, although I think the part I like most about him is that he is not instantly great at using his new power, like I've seen in some other poorly written series. Deku is still very clearly new at having this quirk in this season, and I really like him growing into this slowly, rather than instantly. Bakugou, on the other hand, is amazing at using his quirk, and despite his harsh demeanor and aggressive nature, he is still shown to be very intelligent. I won't spoil too much else about the characters, but the few they do develop this season is great. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I very much enjoyed the first season of My Hero Academia. I binged watched all 13 episodes in only 3 days. MHA has set itself up to be a fantastic long-running shounen. The first season shows off only the bare minimum of what MHA has to offer. The few amazing characters they have this season eventually evolves into a large group of fun and complex characters in the future (at least in the manga, however the show has been very true to its source material so far). I enjoyed this season greatly, with a 9/10. As a long-time fan of all things super hero related, I cannot recommend My Hero Academia enough. It takes some of the most tired tropes in shounen and breathes new life into them. Season 1 of MHA is getting an 8/10 from me, and I can't wait to see what this world will continue to offer in the future.",

            "content": "When I talk about DC Comics or Marvel, and I criticize the regular, passable or interesting things (never bad) they do, I always have in mind two great motors as were \"The Avengers\" or the Batman trilogy filmed by Nolan (especially  \"The Dark Knight\"). I ain't a big fan of this gender of heroes and superheroes and, still, I have watched most of these films so I can have a specific opinion and some values to offer to my readers.\r\nIn the same way, I am not a big fan of \"shonen\": it's true that there are big exceptions like \"Dragon Ball\" or \"Death Note\",and these are, of course, some of the biggest exemples in my list (and some of the highest in position), but this doesn't mean that this gender passionates me. \"My Hero Academia\", or \"Boku No Hero: Academia\" has been able to prove me wrong once more, as these examples did before, in many senses.\\n\\n\r\nI want to start saying that this critic is about the first 13 episodes, as I haven't watched the second season (which in fact lasts almost the double). I point that I'm looking forward to keep watching Deku, Uraraka and all of the characters in the screen, and that I will probably these following days.\\n\\n\r\nI have read great things about the development of this series, especially in its second season, and I must say that I believe them entirely. Even if \"BnH\" is an example of simplicity and has a lack of originality, as it is what it is and we can't expect to watch \"Inception\" or \"Serial Experiments Lain\", at least, this anime does something extremely good, and does something new not only to shonen, but also to anime in general: a group of very interesting and well-written characters.\\n\\n\r\n\"Boku No Hero\" faces a huge issue: to present these characters (which are many) in a lapsus of time very short (13 episodes, as I said). Do you want to know what's best? It affronts this stone in its way almost having fun of it. With one or two sentences, \"BnH\" is able to present these characters in a quick and effective way, without wondering about developping them as it wouldn't work, or showing us their pasts; simply, it exposes its characters and announces what's coming in future seasons.\\n\\n\r\nThis would be a big problem if it wouldn't wake the viewer's interest, but all (or almost) of them wakes interest. Here enters the importance of visual: given to some incredible models, to some striking desings and to very concrete characteristics (and different the ones from the others), most of these characters are able to take place in our mind. Maybe it's hard to remember all of their names, especially for us occidentals, but I'm sure that all of these phisical appareances will stay in your mind.\\n\\n\r\nThat's how a first season should work: as an introduction if your goal is to develop the story slowly and peacefully in future products. Just to give you an example, the biggest excuse of those who defend \"Attack on Titan\" (first season) is that the first 25 episodes are just an introduction. I'm sorry to say that this ain't a reason to write flat and superficial characters: different fronts are open and later on stay in oblivion. The characters don't breath as they should, and they are used as weapons to force the story. This takes a lot of credibility. I'm only saying this as an exemple; you have my opinion about \"Aot\" in my profil.\\n\\n\r\n\"Boku No Hero\" gets to do exactly the contrary: it presents a lot of characters and, in its 13 first episodes (half of AoT) offers to them a moment of glory. Maybe they're not relevant, maybe they're not deep, but putting this patrons in the screen so soon and in a serie that starts in such a modest (and not mediocre) way would be overloading a script which goal is to move forward calmly.\\n\\n\r\nIt's true that we could ask something more about all of this; it's true that it's far from being brillant, sublime or perfect, as a shonen is what it is, and few examples like \"Death Note\" show us what you really can do in a screen directer for youth, but at least, \"My Hero Academia\" is able to do something different from the other shonen and creates a very worthy interest for what's coming.\\n\\n\r\nThere will always be detractors about great pieces, who avoid anime being stuck in big trunk like \"Hajimete No Gal\". It's a very unworthy situation that works this way in all industry and in all media. If it happens in true cinema, why wouldn't it in japanese drawing?",

            "content": "[Note: This is my first review, so please bare with me ;w;]\r\nAfter hearing a few comments and reviews made about this anime; I decided to do it some justice since it was one of the few 2016 (so far) anime that really had an impact on me, rather than being another one that I've 'moved on from' by the next season releases. I will start with the strong points, weak points and then who'd I'd personally recommend it for.\r\nBoku no hero academia is one of those masterpieces put beautifully together, but a few loopholes take that away. The anime really brings the manga to life:fight scenes are intensified, sad backstories were heart touching, characters are emphasized to their best potential (only to the extent of the manga, as a few characters haven't been properly touched on yet) - The producers of the anime knew what they were doing. In my opinion, the art style is beautiful: It's vibrant, it portrays detail and shows a strong resemblance to American cartoons. When you compare to other anime, truth to be told, it may not stand out much, however, I strongly believe that an anime shouldn't be judged by its art. There are anime out there with the most stunning visuals mankind has ever seen, but they are not worth your time (which is a shame really, but it cannot be helped); Boku no hero is not one of those. I feel like this anime really stands out with its hyped up 'superhero themed' music and I believe that it beats One punch man in that aspect. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, I can see why this anime is not everyone's cup of tea: the plot is kind of off putting for the anime community where everyone expects seriousness or some kind of fan service merit, which this anime does not offer. The characters are good; but none of them are particularly outstanding enough to pick a favorite from (but that may just be me). I wish this anime had a bit more to offer rather than it's plot, which was one of the lower points of the anime. You can see the dense influence of American comics in this anime; which probably makes it more suitable for western viewers rather than us weaboos. XD\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this Anime for people who enjoy American cartoons as well as anime (which is probably why I liked this so much). Overall, it's a very refreshing anime to watch as I found it fun to be invested in the main character's hard efforts and his determination. If you are unsure, watch episode one and see whether or not you like the main character: If you found him cute/appealing then keep watching, otherwise if you hate the 'weak boy suddenly gets powers' anime trope that he has, you'd probably best watching something else. Thanks for reading!\\n",
